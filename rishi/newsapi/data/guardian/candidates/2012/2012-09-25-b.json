  "<p>Britain is to provide military advice to the Egyptian government to help it crack down on militants in the Sinai Peninsula who are destabilising relations with neighbouring Israel.</p> <p>In his first meeting with the Egyptian president Mohammed Morsi in New York, David Cameron will announce that Britain's most senior military figure will travel to Cairo. General Sir David Richards, the chief of the defence staff, will lead a British effort that will also see a stabilisation team despatched to Egypt. The team, which will mainly consist of field experts from the Department for International Development, will advise on how to ween Bedouin tribes in Sinai away from smuggling.</p> <p>The prime minister believes that Morsi has made a good start as Egypt's first democratically elected president. In one of his first moves Morsi sanctioned a crack down on militants in Sinai.</p> <p>Cameron will reach out to Morsi by announcing that Britain will press its European partners to relax stringent EU sanctions on Egypt to allow up to \u00a3100m in frozen assets to be repatriated to the government. A taskforce will be established to ensure that assets belonging to the family of the ousted president Hosni Mubarak are returned to Egypt.Cameron wants to show Britain's support for the first democratically elected president of the largest Arab country.</p> <p>Morsi's move against militants in Sinai was seen as a particularly positive signal because Israel was acutely nervous about the election of an Islamist president in Egypt. Morsi was the Muslim Brotherhood's candidate in the election, and Egypt shares a border with the Gaza Strip which is run by Hamas, the Islamist Palestinian party, that has roots in the Muslim Brotherhood.</p> <p>The UN, EU, US and Russia, which oversee the Middle East peace process, fear that instability in the Sinai Peninsula could disrupt the Camp David accords which led to demilitarisation of the area after the 1973 Yom Kippur war. Israel withdrew its forces from the peninsula on the understanding that it would be a non-military zone.</p> <p>A senior British government source said it was important to respond after Morsi's impressive start as president. The source said: \"President Morsi, newly elected, is making an interesting and quite impressive start. It is going to be an absolutely key country for that region's future.\"</p> <p>Britain understands the concerns of some, notably Israel, who fear the appointment of an Islamist president. \"Of course everyone has concerns and worries and interests,\" the source added. \"There will be all sorts of questions in people's minds. You have got to judge people by what they do. He made an impressive start going after the militants in Sinai. That is quite an important move.</p> <p>\"The Arab Spring is working. Look at the reaction in Libya to the appalling events at the US consulate. There were 35,000 people on the streets saying this is not us and going after the militants. There all sorts of reasons to be worried. But net net we should be positive.\"</p> <p>Cameron will tell Morsi that he shares his frustration at the slow pace of repatriating assets that belong to the Mubarak family. Under the EU sanctions rules a series of highly complex legal hurdles have to be cleared before the assets can be unfrozen.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 26 September 2012. An editing error in the seventh paragraph led to the misattribution of a quote to David Cameron rather than a senior British source. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>It's fairly clear that President Obama holds a healthy-sized lead in the race for president. A look at the <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/us/general_election_romney_vs_obama-1171.html\">RealClearPolitics average</a> has Obama by about 4 percentage points, with some polls higher and some lower. That's what we'd expect given random sampling. <a href=\"http://poughies.blogspot.com/2011/05/predicting-elections-is-like-nfl-we.html\">Averages work</a> because the center of a bell-curve is usually right.</p> <p>Yet, it is the pollsters who are showing the closest races \u2013 that is, in this contest, those the friendliest to Mitt Romney \u2013 who are, not surprisingly, receiving the most attention from conservatives. One of the two pollsters with consistently good Mitt Romney numbers compared to the average has been Rasmussen Reports.</p> <p>Rasmussen polls are <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2012/09/17/rasmussen-the-gops-cure-for-the-common-poll/\">mostly ignored</a> by the mainstream media. Whether it is because of Scott Rasmussen's <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/96984054.html\">Republican connections</a>, a <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/04/rasmussen-polls-were-biased-and-inaccurate-quinnipiac-surveyusa-performed-strongly/\">Republican bias</a> in 2010, or the pollster's usage of <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/njonline/the-case-for-robo-pollsters-20090914\">interactive voice response</a> instead of live interviews (which I personally think is a <a href=\"http://poughies.blogspot.com/2010/02/another-argument-against-ivr-polling.html\">bogus reason</a> for lack of attention), Rasmussen remains polling's version of the black sheep of the family.</p> <p>The other poll consistently favorable to Romney has an illustrious history. The Gallup poll has been around longer than most of us have been alive. <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/corporate/21364/george-gallup-19011984.aspx\">Starting in 1935</a>, Gallup has surveyed in over <a href=\"http://thrive.gallup.com/2012/07/womens-health-and-wellbeing-worldwide.html\">140 countries</a> on many different issues. You could argue that the word Gallup is to polling as Coke is to soda.</p> <p>Gallup passes the press's tests for a \"legitimate\" poll, which Rasmussen fails. You don't see Gallup editor-in-chief Frank Newport going on conservative cruises as Scott Rasmussen does. Gallup uses live interviewers. Gallup calls <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/110383/does-gallup-call-cell-phones.aspx\">cellphones</a>.&#xa0;One prominent Washington political analyst I've spoken to has called the Gallup tracking poll the political horse-race equivalent of \"crack\".</p> <p>The question is whether Gallup deserves the outsized attention it is receiving this year? The answer in my opinion is an unequivocal no. Here are three reasons why:</p> <p><strong>1). Gallup has if anything been less accurate in the past than other pollsters in presidential elections</strong></p> <p>Sometimes, certain pollsters know something others don't (for example, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/11/friday-interview-the-polling-guru-of-the-iowa-caucuses/249036/\">Ann Selzer and the Iowa Caucus</a>). I went back into the record books, thanks to the <a href=\"http://ncpp.org/?q=node/101\">National Council on Public Polls</a> and <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2004/president/us/general_election_bush_vs_kerry-939.html\">Real Clear Politics</a>, to see if Gallup works the national equivalent of Selzer's Iowa magic. The answer is no, and it's not even close. Here's Gallup's record over the past five presidential elections:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396685508\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348609601886/Galluppolling_220.jpg\" alt=\"Gallup polling\" width=\"220\" height=\"91\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Gallup has been worse than than the average pollster in three out of the last five elections. On average, Gallup has been worse by 1 percentage point. </p> <p>The average of all the polls (as opposed to comparing Gallup to each pollster, we pool all the pollsters, including Gallup's data, together to form a RealClearPolitics-like average) has had an even better record. The aggregate of all polls beats in Gallup four out of the last five elections. Its average error has only been 2 percentage points \u2013 nearly a point and a half better than Gallup.</p> <p>Gallup has, in other words, been below average compared to other pollsters and is almost always beaten by aggregate of all the polls.</p> <p><strong>2). Gallup in 2010 also had a Republican tilt and it was wildly off-the-mark</strong></p> <p>We've all heard the saying \"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.\" In the <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/2010_generic_congressional_vote-2171.html\">2010 midterm elections</a>, Gallup projected the Republicans would run up a 15-point margin in the national House of Representatives vote. Only two other pollsters were even close to this prediction of a mammoth lead: Fox News at 13 points, and Rasmussen at 12. Though the majority of evidence pointed away from Gallup, Gallup's previously <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/harry-enten/converting_gallups_generic_bal_b_728492.html\">solid record</a> in House elections meant it couldn't be ignored.</p> <p>The election result was a Republican win by 6.8 percentage points, which means Gallup was off by a little over 8 points.</p> <p>Gallup has, apparently, done little to change its polling methods since. They included cellphone surveying in 2010 and still do. Its 2010 demographic samples were, according to Gallup, <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/143468/likely-voters-demographically-typical-skew-conservative.aspx\">typical of a midterm election</a>. They have <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/30/race-2012-election-more-demagogics-demographics\">fewer minorities</a> than other samples in 2012, but that hadn't previously impacted the accuracy of their polls. Overall, Gallup seems to be doing most everything right.</p> <p>Yet, why should we trust Gallup and its Republican House effect, when they showed the same effect in 2010 and it was so inaccurate?</p> <p><strong>3). Gallup leans more Republican than you think</strong></p> <p>Gallup is currently one of the most pro-Romney polls in the RealClearPolitics average, but it's the only poll whose population is registered voters. The registered voter population tends to <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/18/mitt-romney-polls_n_1680827.html\">lean more Democratic</a> than the actual election day electorate that pollsters try to measure through \"likely voters\". Even with <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/156194/Democratic-Voting-Enthusiasm-Down-Sharply-2004-2008.aspx\">sky-high Democratic enthusiasm</a> in 2008, Gallup's likely voter model was still <a href=\"http://pollingreport.com/wh08gen.htm\">2 points more Republican</a> than its registered voter results. Gallup's likely voter model was <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/154559/US-Presidential-Election-Center.aspx?ref=interactive\">3 and 4 more points Republican</a> in 2000 and 2004, respectively.</p> <p>When Gallup turns on its likely voter screen, past experience dictates that, instead of the tied race it currently sees, Gallup will find Romney ahead by a few points. That would make it the most pro-Romney polling data by a few points. That would also make it more friendly to Romney <em>than Rasmussen</em>.</p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <p>Both Gallup and Rasmussen continue to show a close race that most other pollsters don't see. That doesn't mean they should be ignored; they should be examined as part of a larger pool of polls that indicate a clear Obama lead.</p> <p>Gallup was a pioneer in the polling industry, but first doesn't equal best. Gallup may have the right ingredients, yet the sauce is just a little off. There's no reason to think they are right this time around while everyone else is wrong.</p>",
  "<p>Barely one week in and the party conference season already feels more like the pantomime season. Politicians who spend their day jobs joshing round the cabinet table are now at each other's throats. Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have wasted no opportunity to denounce each other, while plotting to unseat their own leaders.</p> <p>In Brighton, Lib Dems talk for all the world as if they're the official opposition, while the chief whip, Andrew Mitchell, plays the role of timeless Tory villain by rounding on police officers as \"plebs\". Nick Clegg promises a wealth tax he can't deliver, as his rival Vince Cable declares that Tories are aroused by sacking people \u2013 and David Cameron's nemesis, Boris Johnson, launches a campaign to save Clegg on the grounds that he's a \"natural Tory\".</p> <p>Differentiation has been the autumn rage since the early days of the coalition. But midway through the parliament, it's getting more serious. This is a deeply unpopular government whose central economic policy is failing. The Lib Dems are polling less than half their general election score and face what Cable calls \"political oblivion\". <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/ios-exclusive-liberal-democrat-members-lose-faith-in-their-leader-8165988.html\" title=\"\">Clegg is increasingly rejected by his own members</a>.</p> <p>David Cameron, meanwhile, is under sustained attack from his right wing, who are convinced all would be well if the government would only slash taxes and regulation. They have now found their prince over the water in the unlikely shape of Johnson. So expect some scapegoating of benefit claimants and migrants \u2013 and mockery of hapless Lib Dems \u2013 when the Tories meet in Birmingham in a couple of weeks.</p> <p>Some of the battles are real enough. But when it comes to the core of the government's programme, they're little more than shadow boxing. As the Lib Dems' man at the Treasury, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/25/danny-alexander-crackdown-tax-avoidance\" title=\"\">Danny Alexander, spelled out</a> on Tuesday, the whole coalition backs a scale of cuts the Institute for Fiscal Studies has called \"almost without historical and international precedent\" \u2013 but is now committed to an additional \u00a315bn squeeze for 2015-16.</p> <p>For all the Lib Dem boasts about their green credentials, a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/sep/20/ofsted-chief-warns-pupil-premium\" title=\"\">pupil premium that isn't getting through to the poorest</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/24/pleb-jobe-tories-flashman-thinking\" title=\"\">increases in tax allowances that are mainly benefiting the better off</a>, they remain fully signed up to the main agenda: an austerity, welfare cuts and privatisation programme that is cutting taxes for the rich and the banks, throttling recovery and threatening to widen inequality still further for years to come.</p> <p>We may not all be in this together \u2013 but they are. Lib Dem activists naturally don't like it, but there's little sign of rebellion. In what remains the most democratic of the main parties' conferences, delegates still allowed themselves to be pushed into voting for more austerity \u2013 apparently out of loyalty and fear of what Tim Farron, their president, insisted would mean \"chaos, mass unemployment and human misery\".</p> <p>When it comes to the Liberal Democrat leadership, it's easy to forget how close the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12310041\" title=\"\">Orange Book faction</a> around Clegg were to the Tories on economic policy to start with. In an echo of New Labour, the pro-privatisation, small state Orange Bookers \u2013 including Clegg, David Laws and Ed Davey \u2013 took over the Lib Dems at exactly the time the neoliberal model they so admired was imploding in the crisis of 2007-8.</p> <p>But their rapid rise laid the ground for the coalition with Cameron's Tories. And any idea that they might have rethought a discredited ideology was dispelled on the Brighton fringe, where the home office minister Jeremy Browne rhapsodised about the free market, and Orange Book editor and hedge funder Paul Marshall gleefully recalled that Cable, another contributor, had endorsed privatisation of public services and a state spending cap of 40% of GDP (it's now about 45%).</p> <p>Cable, who also backed light touch regulation of finance before the crash, has long since repositioned himself as a born-again social democrat. And while pushing through a state-backed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/24/vince-cable-small-business-bank1\" title=\"\">small business bank</a> in the half-baked form that is all George Osborne will allow him, he's been touting himself as the ideal Lib Dem leader for a future coalition with Labour \u2013 or anyone else for that matter.</p> <p>The danger for Ed Miliband in all these confected coalition spats is that it makes it seem as if the crucial political debate is taking place within the coalition and its constituent parts, not between the coalition and Labour. While Labour hedges about a wealth tax or welfare cuts, it allows Cable and other Lib Dems to posture as opposition leaders even as they drive through government policy.</p> <p>The chance to correct some of that will come at Labour's own conference next week. Miliband is expected to promote a \"one nation Labour\" line, which has the advantage of highlighting the Tories' social divisiveness and narrow class base. But it could also be co-opted to try and resurrect New Labour corporate featherbedding and blur the need to take on the interests of the 1% and the City, if the economy is to be reconstituted on a new basis.</p> <p>More dangerous is the trap being laid by Osborne to box Labour into a commitment to sweeping coalition cuts and austerity after 2015 as a way of demonstrating its fiscal rectitude. What was debilitating in the benign conditions of 1997 would be a calamity in a period of crisis, stagnation and falling living standards. Better have that argument now than in the runup to an election \u2013 it's not one that can be left to politicians alone.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/seumasmilne\" title=\"\"><em>@SeumasMilne</em></a></p>",

  "<p>Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney have been crisscrossing America on the campaign trail for months but seldom turn up on the same day at the same event. They did Tuesday at Bill Clinton's annual international aid conference.</p> <p>It was a rare opportunity to compare and contrast, a clash in New York of the White House incumbent and the challenger. </p> <p>Obama is still the bigger draw, with long lines forming 90 minutes before to hear him. Romney did not come close to matching that, although this might have been in part because he was speaking early in the morning, just after 9am, with people still making their way from breakfast.</p> <p>Romney, under huge strain after a series of campaign disasters and polls showing him trailing Obama, rose to the occasion. Normally a poor speaker, often dismissed as 'wooden', he was surprisingly poised and relaxed and his delivery relatively smooth. He also dispensed with his normal stump speech and largely avoided attacks on Obama, instead making a case for tying international aid to free trade deals and stimulating the private sector.</p> <p>By contrast, Obama looked tired, as if he is the one that should be under strain in the election race rather than Romney. But, even tired, Obama is a better speaker than Romney. </p> <p>He devoted his speech to human trafficking, an emotional plea to tackle what he described as \"barbaric\" problem, modern-day slavery. He sounded as if he was addressing a much bigger theme than Romney's, and with passion.</p> <p>Both were speaking at the Clinton Global Initiative conference, the aid foundation set up by the former president which delivers millions of dollars to the developing world each year. Those attending are a mixture of leaders from the developing world, philanthropists, corporate representatives and the heads of non-governmental organisations.</p> <p>The conference audience leans more towards Obama than Romney. Romney received a standing ovation at the start of his speech. Obama received one at the beginning and end.</p> <p>On the face of it, the conference was potentially awkward for Romney, given that it is being hosted by Clinton, who delivered a widely admired speech of the Democratic convention in which he made the case against a Romney presidency. That speech helped contribute to Obama's campaign bounce. </p> <p>But Clinton, introducing Romney, was cordial and Romney smiled as the two stood at the podium. The two shook hands and Romney was on.</p> <p>It was not only that Romney's delivery has improved, he also managed to laugh at himself.</p> <p>\"I appreciate the kind words and your invitation here today. If there's one thing we've learned this election season, it's that a few words from Bill Clinton can do any man a lot of good \u2026 After that introduction, I guess all I have to do is wait a day or two for the bounce.\"</p> <p>The core of Romney's speech was international aid, promising that as president he would tie it to encouraging the private sector in the developing world and to free trade deals, what he called a Prosperity Pact.</p> <p>\"For American foreign aid to become more effective, it must embrace the power of partnerships, access the transformative nature of free enterprise, and leverage the abundant resources that can come from the private sector,\" he said.</p> <p>The closest he came to criticising Obama was saying that Americans were \"troubled\" by events in the Middle East. He also, without naming him, described the Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, attending the UN general assembly, as \"a voice of unspeakable evil and hatred\".</p> <p>When Obama arrived, Clinton went one better than a handshake, giving the president a hug. Obama, returning the favour, praised not only Clinton's speech to the Democratic convention but Hillary Clinton for her grace and grit that he said had made her one of the finest ever secretaries of state, a tribute that helps in building her up for a potential 2016 presidential run.</p> <p>Obama, who has opted for more sober, downbeat speeches this year, offered glimpses of the speaker he had been in 2008, making an emotional plea for an end to worldwide human trafficking. He put it in the context of the Emancipation Proclamation, a copy of which was hanging from the wall of his office in the White House.</p> <p>Human trafficking, Obama said, \"ought to concern every person, because it's a debasement of our common humanity. It ought to concern every community, because it tears at the social fabric. It ought to concern every business, because it distorts markets. It ought to concern every nation, because it endangers public health and fuels violence and organised crime. I'm talking about the injustice, the outrage, of human trafficking, which must be called by its true name \u2013 modern slavery.\" </p> <p>He promised the US would tackle the problem more vigorously than it was at present and announced a few measures. In reality, though, the US does little, as Clinton acknowledged after the speech, noting that most of the work is done by non-governmental bodies rather than governments.</p> <p>Obama has attended the conference every year he has been president and Romney, towards the end of his own speech, said: \"A year from now, I hope to return to this meeting as president.\" </p> <p>If he had delivered speeches throughout the year with the same apparent conviction as he did at the Clinton conference, he might stand a more realistic chance of fulfilling that hope.</p>",

Based on hundreds of hours of extensive daydreaming, FURY leaves the reader in no doubt that President Obama, who as you may know is black, is also very, very angry \u2013 as a direct result of his furious rage.</p> <p><strong>I KNOW YOU ARE, BUT WHAT AM I? by Jonah Goldberg</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396680593\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348599058643/goldberg.jpg\" alt=\"Jonah Goldberg\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In this pathbreaking work of scholarship \u2013 a tour-de-force in the style of his bestseller <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Liberal-Fascism-American-Mussolini-Politics/dp/0385511841\">Liberal Fascism</a> \u2013 National Review writer Goldberg turns conventional wisdom on its head. Did you think the Nazis were rightwing? Actually, they were leftwing. Were you under the impression that the Democrats were the party of civil rights? Actually, that was the Republicans. Did you think that you should vote for Obama? Actually, you should vote for Romney. Do you think Jonah Goldberg is a contrarian for the sake of it? Actually, he's <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/slates_10th_anniversary/2006/06/whats_wrong_with_slate_4.html\">vociferously opposed to contrarianism</a>. True to the spirit of Goldberg's worldview, the spine of this book is to the right of the pages, rather than to the left, the words can only be read if reflected in a mirror and the best way to enjoy it is not to buy it.</p> <p><strong>PUNK'D!!! Conservative Arguments to Drive Liberals #@!**?@ Crazy!, by SE Cupp and Greg Gutfeld</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396680594\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348599090400/secupp.jpg\" alt=\"SE Cupp\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>A book for butt-kicking, red-blooded conservatives who just don't care how much liberals hate the fact that they love hunting with guns, eating red meat or dressing up in combat gear and pretending that the guest bedroom is a Marine training camp! In PUNK'D!!!, gun-totin', right-leanin', final-letter-of-words-omittin' MSNBC commentator <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._E._Cupp\">SE Cupp</a> (author of Why You're Wrong About the Right) and <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/red-eye/index.html\">hilarious Fox News humorist Greg Gutfeld</a> team up to show that liberals aren't going to stop conservatives going hunting, or thinking about how it would probably be quite exciting to go hunting, or pretending that they went hunting once!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396680595\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348599132522/gutfield.jpg\" alt=\"Greg Gutfield\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This book is sure to annoy the \"politically correct\" brigade, whose opinions Cupp and Gutfeld certainly don't care about! They really couldn't care less if leftwingers are outraged by what they've got to say! Not in the slightest! Really! (Important note: while reading this book, be sure to imagine that thousands of liberals have also bought it, for inexplicable reasons, and are being enraged by it, otherwise the entire premise collapses.)</p> <p><strong>DISTORTION: Fighting The Publishing Industry's Liberal Lies, Communist Contortions and Socialist Spin, by Bernard Goldberg</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396680596\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348599169438/bGoldberg.jpg\" alt=\"Bernard Goldberg\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Goldberg, a former CBS producer, shot to fame in 2001 when he published <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Bias-Insider-Exposes-Media-Distort/dp/0895261901\">Bias</a>, an impassioned account of how leftwing bias made it impossible for conservative voices to be heard in America. As if to prove his point, the book became a New York Times No 1 bestseller, but only for several weeks \u2013 and although Goldberg was interviewed in many news outlets, not one liberal publication dedicated an entire issue to his work. In this latest text, which has already sold 3m copies on pre-order, he shows how liberal tyranny has made it impossible to publish a conservative-leaning book in the United States.</p> <p><strong>SPECIAL THINGS YOU CAN DO TO MAKE GOD SMILE, by Joel Osteen</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396680597\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348599199294/osteen.jpg\" alt=\"Joel Osteen\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Be inspired to live the life of abundance that God intended for you.

  "<p>President Barack Obama today sought to reset US relations with the Arab world in the wake of anti-American riots triggered by an amateur video insulting the prophet Mohamed, that led to the death of the US ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens.</p> <p>Obama used his speech to the UN general assembly, expected to be his last major foreign policy address before the November elections, to pay a personal tribute to Stevens, highlighting the murdered diplomat's passion for Arab culture and support for democracy, and present it a model for American-Arab relations.</p> <p>The president also restated the US position on the Iran nuclear programme: that there was still time for diplomacy, but not \"unlimited time\". He also called for the emergence of a new, democratic and inclusive government in Syria, but offered no new ideas about how the international community should help attain that goal, or how the deadlock in the UN security council over Syria might be broken.</p> <p>In a landmark speech in Cairo three years ago, Obama promised a \"new beginning\" in the relationship between his country and the Islamic world, but that relationship is now at its lowest point since the start of the Arab spring as a result of a YouTube video clip made by an Egyptian American insulting the prophet Mohamed.</p> <p>The crude 14-minute clip went viral over the summer, triggering furious anti-American demonstrations across the Middle East and the wider Islamic world.</p> <p>Obama balanced condemnation of the \"crude and disgusting\" video, with a denunciation of the violence that it sparked and a demand for the new Arab governments to do more to defend American diplomats.</p> <p>\"I have made it clear that the US government had nothing to do with this video, and I believe its message must be rejected by all who respect our common humanity,\" Obama said. \" It is an insult not only to Muslims, but to America as well. We are home to Muslims who worship across our country.\"</p> <p>Obama rejected calls from Arab and other Islamic leaders for the YouTube video to be somehow banned, pointed to US constitutional protections of free speech and the technical impossibility of controlling such broadcasts.</p> <p>\"[I]n 2012, at a time when anyone with a cell phone can spread offensive views around the world with the click of a button, the notion that we can control the flow of information is obsolete. The question, then, is how we respond. And on this we must agree: there is no speech that justifies mindless violence,\" he said. He also criticised double standards in the protection of religion in the Middle East.</p> <p>\"The future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam. Yet to be credible, those who condemn that slander must also condemn the hate we see when the image of Jesus Christ is desecrated, churches are destroyed, or the Holocaust is denied,\" the president said.</p> <p>He also made clear his dissatisfaction with the reaction of some Arab governments to the wave of anti-American riots. US officials have singled out the Egyptian president, Mohamed Morsi, in this regard.</p> <p>\"If we are serious about upholding these ideals, it will not be enough to put more guards in front of an embassy; or to put out statements of regret, and wait for the outrage to pass. If we are serious about those ideals, we must speak honestly about the deeper causes of this crisis,\" he said.</p> <p>Obama expressed gratitude to the government and people of Libya, after pro-American protesters seized control of the bases of the extremist militias implicated in the attacks on the US consulate in Benghazi, but he made it clear Washington did not believe all the perpetrators had been caught, and left open the option of taking direct action.</p> <p>\"The attacks on our civilians in Benghazi were attacks on America. We are grateful for the assistance we received from the Libyan government and the Libyan people. And there should be no doubt that we will be relentless in tracking down the killers and bringing them to justice,\" the president said.</p> <p>Earlier, the UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon issued an unusually stern denouncement of security council inaction over Syria, which he called \"a regional calamity with global ramifications.\"</p> <p>\"This is a serious and growing threat to international peace and security which requires security council action,\" Ban said. \"The international community should not look the other way as violence spirals out of control.\"</p> <p>UN officials said that Ban has become increasingly frustrated by the security council's deadock over Syria and had decided to speak out in his bluntest speech to date.</p> <p>He also called for those responsibility for atrocities in Syria to be held accountable, noting \"there is no statute of limitations for such extreme violence\", and placing most of the blame on the Assad regime. At present, Russian and Chinese objections are blocking the international criminal court from launching an investigation into war crimes, and Ban's comments were widely seen at the UN as a direct rebuke for their obstruction of the machinery of international justice.</p> <p>\"Brutal human rights abuses continue to be committed, mainly by the government, but also by opposition groups. Such crimes must not go unpunished,\" he said. \"It is the duty of our generation to put an end to impunity for international crimes, in Syria and elsewhere. It is our duty to give tangible meaning to the responsibility to protect.\"</p> <p>The responsibility to protect was a principle adopted by the UN in the 1990s, stating that the international community to intervene to protect civilian populations when their states were unwilling or unable to do so.</p> <p>Ban also had pointed words for two leaders due to speak at the same UN podium later in the week: Binyamin Netanyahu and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, calling for them to pull back from the brink of a new Middle East conflict, and to ratchet down their rhetoric.</p> <p>\"I \u2026 reject both the language of de-legitimisation and threats of potential military action by one state against another. Any such attacks would be devastating. The shrill war talk of recent weeks has been alarming,\" Ban said. \"Leaders have a responsibility to use their voices to lower tensions instead of raising the temperature and volatility of the moment.\"</p> <p>Netanyahu has been successful in displacing the Israel-Palestinian impasse from the international agenda by repeated threats to take military action against Iran. But he was warned by Ban that his government's policies in the West Bank were stoking renewed conflict.</p> <p>\"The two-state solution is the only sustainable option. Yet the door may be closing, for good. The continued growth of Israeli settlement settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory seriously undermines efforts toward peace. We must break this dangerous impasse,\" Ban said.</p>",
  "<p>An Iranian MP has criticised the country's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, for taking more than a hundred people with him to the UN general assembly in New York, saying the large entourage had travelled there for \"a picnic\".</p> <p>At a time when many Iranians are struggling with economic hardship because of sanctions, almost 140 people have joined their president in his final visit to New York. Most of them are staying at the city's luxurious Warwick hotel, where suites can cost up to \u00a31,000 a night.</p> <p>The president is expected to address the general assembly on Wednesday in a speech that is highly anticipated by both his opponents in Iran and those watching him for any hint about the country's disputed nuclear programme or Tehran's support for Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria.</p> <p>Initially, visas had been requested for some 160 people, but the semi-official Fars news agency reported that about 20 applications were turned down, including those for members of his cabinet and two ministers. Other Iranian sources, however, have put the numbers of those banned from US trip as high as 60.</p> <p>Ahmadinejad's chief of staff and close confidant, Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, who is despised by the rival conservatives as the head of a \"deviant current\" within the president's inner circle, and the foreign minister Ali Akbar Salehi are accompanying him for the UN visit.</p> <p>In recent days, Iranian parliamentarians and media have spoken against the number of people travelling along with Ahmadinejad to the US, a country Iranian leaders depict as their sworn enemy.</p> <p>\"Many of [the people accompanying the president] have only travelled there for a picnic,\" protested the deputy head of the parliamentary committee on national security, Mansour Haghighatpour, according to the semi-official Ilna news agency.</p> <p>It is not the first time Ahmadinejad has come under fire for taking many of his allies to such a high-profile visit. He has faced criticism in previous years for having his staff's families along with him abroad.</p> <p>A prominent Iranian cartoonist, Touka Neyestani, reacted by publishing a cartoon on the website of the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, depicting Ahmadinejad wearing an \"I love New York\" T-shirt.</p> <p>On Tuesday, a video showing Ahmadinejad reacting to the uproar about his companions while passing through gates at the UN also fuelled controversy. Many web users who shared the video on social networking websites said the president had sworn at his opponents while others insisted his words were, in fact, not clear.</p> <p>Ahmadinejad is in his final year of office and under the current Iranian law cannot run for a third term. After a series of setbacks in a power struggle with conservatives, especially over his staunch support for Mashaei, the president has lost a great deal of influence over Iranian politics, prompting many to view him as an increasingly lame duck, but despite his dwindling power at home, he is still grabbing headlines outside.</p> <p>While in New York, the Iranian president gave interviews to the American media, including CNN's Piers Morgan, and invited a group of journalists for a breakfast meeting which the New Yorker's David Remnick said was promoted as an exchange of ideas but turned out \"to be a group interview\".</p> <p>In response to Morgan's questions about his views on homosexuality, Ahmadinejad said: \"I'm sorry. Let me ask you this. Do you believe that anyone is giving birth through homosexuality? Homosexuality ceases procreation. Who has said that if you like or believe in doing something ugly, and others do not accept your behaviour, that they're denying your freedom?\"</p> <p>In reaction to Ahmadinejad's comments, the Iranian journalist Omid Memarian <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Omid_M/status/250417679310131200\" title=\"\">tweeted</a>: \"#Ahmadinejad's response to #gay issue was not much different than what Romney or Santorum might h[ave] said.\"</p> <p>Reacting to Remnick's question about an Iranian institute recently raising the bounty on the head of Salman Rushdie amid controversy over an anti-Islam film, Ahmadinejad responded: \"Salman Rushdie, where is he now? \u2026 There is no news of him. Is he in the United States? If he is in the US, you shouldn't broadcast that, for his own safety.\"</p> <p>Ahmadinejad's visit to New York has also sparked demonstrations in front of his hotel and the UN headquarters.</p>",
  "<p>Can he do it again? With less than two months to go before the 2012 US election, that is the question <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/garyyounge\" title=\"\">Gary Younge</a> poses of Barack Obama in his extensive critique of the American president, which opens on this week's cover and continues inside the paper.</p> <p>Stripped of the hope and optimism so central to his 2008 campaign, Obama is a very different voter proposition this time around, argues Younge. But despite the flat state of the US economy, a narrow lead in the polls over his faltering Republican rival <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/mittromney\" title=\"\">Mitt Romney</a> suggests the Amercan electorate may still view Obama as the least-worst option on offer.

  "<p>We don't see Clint Eastwood in front of the camera much these days, and fans of the grizzled old warhorse won't be disappointed by his first public outing since the Republican national convention. Whereas Eastwood's televised rant in Florida was built on an inchoate manifesto of dissatisfaction and featured <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/aug/31/clint-eastwood-chair-speech-mitt-romney?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">an unedited monologue with an empty chair</a>, things are different with his new character, Gus.</p> <p>Trouble with the Curve is a gently effective family reconciliation drama set against the backdrop of professional baseball. It presents a somewhat sprightlier and more coherent Eastwood than the furniture whisperer. Not that Gus shies from addressing mute objects \u2013 a can of Spam, a tombstone and even his penis are all beneficiaries of Eastwood's words of wisdom.</p> <p>Despite this navel-gazing, Trouble with the Curve marks the first time since Wolfgang Petersen directed him in the 1993 thriller In the Line of Fire that Clint has handed the reins to another film-maker. This time it's Robert Lorenz, Eastwood's longtime assistant, who delivers a highly accomplished directorial debut \u2013 albeit one that stays well within the bounds of Hollywood's cookie-cutter approach to the family portrait.</p> <p>Gus is a legendary baseball scout who works for the Atlanta Braves and definitely wouldn't get along with the sabermetrics acolytes of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/142852/moneyball\" title=\"\">Moneyball</a>. With three months left on his contract, he heads over to the Carolinas to check out a prospect. Joining Gus is his workaholic attorney daughter Mickey, who is played by Amy Adams. She's angling for partner at her law firm but takes off a few days at the behest of a family friend who's concerned about Gus's failing eyesight.</p> <p>As the business side of the trip gets tricky, the uneasy father-daughter relationship thaws. Gus's beloved wife died when Mickey was six and he sent his daughter to live with relatives. There's a reason for this, which Lorenz touches on in a perfunctory manner that jars with the overall polish of the movie. Mickey's personal inhibitions are further challenged when she falls for an uncomplicated love interest played by Justin Timberlake.</p> <p>Warner Bros has a strong stable of award contenders this season and, while this will not be a major contender across all categories, the performances are strong and there could be a chance for Eastwood and Adams. It's no surprise that Trouble with the Curve bears all the hallmarks of Lorenz's mentor: prickly codger with soft centre, feisty young gal who inspires him to re-engage with life and unlikeable fringe players who get their comeuppance. Not<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/35209/unforgiven\" title=\"\"> Unforgiven</a>-style, you understand, although you sense Gus wouldn't mind taking a pop at anyone who gets his goat.</p>",
  "<p>Do you like to imagine the moment David Cameron and Boris Johnson met at Oxford? I do. I fancy it was in a college bar for a jolly night of mead-quaffing and totty-snogging. Young David, a head full of ambition and a face pinking poshly, walked into the bar (or, as such venues are known to Oxford students, \"chunder chamber\") and there \u2013 there he spotted him. Across the room, sitting in a corner, with one eye on the upcoming election for Union president and another on the barmaid's heaving bosom, was a young mop-top. Their eyes met and lasers shot between them, like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yeA7a0uS3A\" title=\"\">those</a> that would shoot out of He-Man's sword when he shouted \"By the power of Grayskull!\", but possibly less cool. Up in the heavens, the gods nodded to themselves. \"Ah yes,\" they said. \"These two young scamps shall be bound unto one another throughout their lives; where one leads the other shall follow, yet the skills they possess will differ greatly in certain key respects leading to Icarus-like moments for each. So be it!\"</p> <p>And lo, it duly came to pass. The two men have ever since been locked in a rap turf war, each battling for supremacy. Even though D-Cam is, strictly speaking, more powerful, Bo-Jo is undoubtedly ahead these days, what with \"his\" Olympics and what have you.</p> <p>Which makes the news that Cameron will appear on Wednesday night on the US talkshow The Late Show with David Letterman both predictable and pitiable. Predictable in the sense that Johnson was on it just six months ago so there is the smack of sad inevitability that Cameron would opt to go on it, too, during his trip to New York to promote British business. Pitiable because little good can come of this, and this is due to both Cameron and the nature of US talkshows.</p> <p>US talkshows, particularly late-night talkshows, particularly network talkshows, are a huge deal in America, for reasons that baffle anyone who has ever been forced to watch one. Whereas in Britain a talkshow host who is relegated to the 11.30pm slot on a Wednesday is generally seen as pretty much fired in all but name, in America they will be <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/53/207B.html\" title=\"\">paid</a> $32m and are talked about as if they are the king of TV, no matter how large their <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Leading-My-Chin-Jay-Leno/dp/0061094927\" title=\"\">chin</a>. Arguments about who will host which show and at what time are rehearsed with the <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2010/04/wolcott-201004\" title=\"\">solemnity</a> with which other people discuss their own mortality.</p> <p>All this goes some way to explain why so many talkshow hosts, cable and network, are such asses. With the exception of Craig Ferguson (The Late Late Show) and occasionally Letterman, the interviewing style of most of these guys falls into one of two camps: lazily sycophantic (how can you expect them to prepare? So much of their day must be spent counting their golden coins) or attention-hogging. Even everybody's favourite human, Jon Stewart, generally falls into the former category while his former colleague, the wonderful Stephen Colbert, is firmly in the latter.</p> <p>All of this means that the guests either have to be amazing personalities in their own right, or be able to step back and just let the host get on with their gurning and pre-written jokes.</p> <p>Letterman is an ever-so-slightly different proposition. For a start, he is excellent at making off-the-cuff remarks, by which I mean he is no slouch when it comes to insulting even the starriest of guests and is perfectly comfortable bantering with the difficult ones, from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1143xAYZGwM\" title=\"\">a potty-mouthed Madonna</a> to a frankly <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALapHYNSmoA\" title=\"\">loopy Crispin Glover</a>. Despite working in the most rigid and anachronistic of formats, he can occasionally claim some good scalps, such as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkDjz_eRoaw\" title=\"\">Fox News's Bill O'Reilly</a>. Which means the audience for his show comes expecting: celebrities, hopefully; good banter, at least; and, at best, celebrities with good banter.</p> <p>Say what you like about the London mayor, and that is especially encouraged in this newspaper, but the man gives good TV. When he did the US TV rounds last summer he did OK with Jon Stewart \u2013 losing points for some flat-falling jokes but gaining eternal credit from me for bringing The Daily Show back to the UK \u2013 and he came into his own on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZdY-qJRMG0\" title=\"\">The Late Show</a>, getting in his \"reincarnated as an olive\" saw and knowing when to sit quietly and allow Letterman to insult his hair.</p> <p>If a foreign politician wants to impress a US talkshow audience, they have to get this balance right because, by the time they have walked on stage, the audience is already bored. Imagine how you would feel if Graham Norton announced that his next guest was the mayor of Turin: that's how US viewers feel when they learn they have stayed up until midnight to see a British politician. They wanted Angelina Jolie, they got David Cameron.</p> <p>Cameron, arguably to his credit, is not a Personality; he will also want to talk about British businesses, which no one wants to hear about. He has never been good at letting jokes at his expense slide and his attempts at banter often just make him look posh and mean. American talkshow banter is all about self-deprecation, a language in which Boris is fluent; the closest Dave has ever come to self-deprecation is admitting he's only the fifth cousin to the queen.</p> <p>Dave will struggle to win this particular Boris battle: he'll either stay quiet and look dull, or he'll try to joke and he'll embarrass himself. Either way, he'll look worse than his Boris. And&#xa0;lo, the star-cross'd old Bullers rage on.</p>",

When I saw the show a few days ago \u2013 an odd experience, in the middle of an ongoing global blasphemy debate, not least because half the audience looked as if it would have been more at home at Evita or Wicked \u2013 it somehow managed through the mockery, to make one feel quite fond of Mormons. </p> <p>And of the elasticity of American culture. The Guardian is pretty relaxed about swearing, but there is a line in the first 10 minutes of the show that's too rude even for here, and which might delicately be summarised as a character's suggestion that God, in his cruelty, be penetrated in every orifice, with an itemised list of what that entails. People were expecting something a bit naughty from the creators of South Park, but this drew a unified gasp across the auditorium. In a mainstream theatre on a Sunday afternoon, it was hard not to find this cheering.</p> <p>Of course, those likely to be seriously offended by the show probably wrote off New York as Sodom and Gomorrah long ago and are too busy picketing abortion clinics in Mississippi to bother with Broadway. And in terms of the show's topicality, Mormonism isn't a religion whose members might be feeling more broadly under siege. No one is going to stop a dorky white guy at airport security for looking like a Mormon. But still. </p> <p>Trey Parker and Matt Stone always said it was an affectionate portrait of the church, the kind of affection that comes with a pat on the head for being cutely delusional. In fact, it's a deeply scathing attack on religion in general, depicting the two main characters \u2013 missionaries to Uganda \u2013 as well-meaning idiots who sing a song about how they'll believe anything and who hope that, with any luck, the promised land will look like Orlando.</p> <p>Interestingly, the biggest laugh of the afternoon went to a line from a \"Ugandan villager\", who pointed out that Salt Lake City, spiritual home of Mormonism, should be taken not literally, but as a metaphor. The Ugandans, it turned out, were more sophisticated than the Americans in understanding this \u2013 a point everyone in the theatre was very pleased with themselves for enjoying.</p> <p>In spite of all this, you came out of the show feeling weirdly warm towards the Mormons, for having the ability to laugh at themselves, even though it wasn't them doing the laughing. Given that one of Romney's image problems has been a brittle sense of his insecurity, it wouldn't hurt him to take note of the fuzzy dividends that come with being seen to know one's own faults. You know: \"I have such distance and clarity in regard to these drawbacks in my personality, they practically belong to someone else!\"</p> <p>Before the Book of Mormon opened, people anticipated protests outside the theatre, but unlike the Christian protesters who disrupted Jerry Springer: the Opera 10 years ago, that didn't happen. The Mormon church played a blinder with its response to the show, in a well-measured statement:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The production may attempt to entertain audiences for an evening, but the Book of Mormon as a volume of scripture will change people's lives forever by bringing them closer to Christ.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Which makes you wonder who their PR team are, and why they aren't working for the Romney campaign.</p>",
  "<p>Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, fellow delegates, ladies and gentleman: I would like to begin today by telling you about an American named Chris Stevens.<br> </p> <p>Chris was born in a town called Grass Valley, California, the son of a lawyer and a musician. As a young man, Chris joined the Peace Corps, and taught English in Morocco. He came to love and respect the people of North Africa and the Middle East, and he would carry that commitment throughout his life. As a diplomat, he worked from Egypt to Syria; from Saudi Arabia to Libya. He was known for walking the streets of the cities where he worked \u2013 tasting the local food, meeting as many people as he could, speaking Arabic and listening with a broad smile.</p> <p>Chris went to Benghazi in the early days of the Libyan revolution, arriving on a cargo ship. As America's representative, he helped the Libyan people as they coped with violent conflict, cared for the wounded, and crafted a vision for a future in which the rights of all Libyans would be respected. After the revolution, he supported the birth of a new democracy, as Libyans held elections, built new institutions, and began to move forward after decades of dictatorship.</p> <p>Chris Stevens loved his work. He took pride in the country he served, and saw dignity in the people he met. Two weeks ago, he travelled to Benghazi to review plans to establish a new cultural center and modernize a hospital. That's when America's compound came under attack. Along with three of his colleagues, Chris was killed in the city he helped to save. He was 52 years old.</p> <p>I tell you this story because Chris Stevens embodied the best of America. Like his fellow Foreign Service officers, he built bridges across oceans and cultures, and was deeply invested in the international cooperation that the United Nations represents. He acted with humility, but stood up for a set of principles \u2013 a belief that individuals should be free to determine their own destiny, and live with liberty, dignity, justice, and opportunity.</p> <p>The attacks on our civilians in Benghazi were attacks on America. We are grateful for the assistance we received from the Libyan government and the Libyan people. And there should be no doubt that we will be relentless in tracking down the killers and bringing them to justice. I also appreciate that in recent days, the leaders of other countries in the region \u2013 including Egypt, Tunisia, and Yemen \u2013 have taken steps to secure our diplomatic facilities, and called for calm. So have religious authorities around the globe.</p> <p>But the attacks of the last two weeks are not simply an assault on America. They are also an assault on the very ideals upon which the United Nations was founded \u2013 the notion that people can resolve their differences peacefully; that diplomacy can take the place of war; and that in an interdependent world, all of us have a stake in working towards greater opportunity and security for our citizens.</p> <p>If we are serious about upholding these ideals, it will not be enough to put more guards in front of an Embassy; or to put out statements of regret, and wait for the outrage to pass. If we are serious about those ideals, we must speak honestly about the deeper causes of this crisis. Because we face a choice between the forces that would drive us apart, and the hopes we hold in common.</p> <p>Today, we must affirm that our future will be determined by people like Chris Stevens, and not by his killers. Today, we must declare that this violence and intolerance has no place among our United Nations.</p> <p>It has been less than two years since a vendor in Tunisia set himself on fire to protest the oppressive corruption in his country, and sparked what became known as the Arab Spring. Since then, the world has been captivated by the transformation that has taken place, and the United States has supported the forces of change.</p> <p>We were inspired by the Tunisian protests that toppled a dictator, because we recognized our own beliefs in the aspirations of men and women who took to the streets.</p> <p>We insisted on change in Egypt, because our support for democracy put us on the side of the people.</p> <p>We supported a transition of leadership in Yemen, because the interests of the people were not being served by a corrupt status quo.</p> <p>We intervened in Libya alongside a broad coalition, and with the mandate of the U.N. Security Council, because we had the ability to stop the slaughter of innocents; and because we believed that the aspirations of the people were more powerful than a tyrant.</p> <p>And as we meet here, we again declare that the regime of Bashar al-Assad must come to an end so that the suffering of the Syrian people can stop, and a new dawn can begin.</p> <p>We have taken these positions because we believe that freedom and self-determination are not unique to one culture. These are not simply American values or Western values \u2013 they are universal values. And even as there will be huge challenges that come with a transition to democracy, I am convinced that ultimately government of the people, by the people and for the people is more likely to bring about the stability, prosperity, and individual opportunity that serve as a basis for peace in our world.</p> <p>So let us remember that this is a season of progress. For the first time in decades, Tunisians, Egyptians, and Libyans voted for new leaders in elections that were credible, competitive, and fair. This democratic spirit has not been restricted to the Arab World. Over the past year, we have seen peaceful transitions of power in Malawi and Senegal, and a new President in Somalia. In Burma, a President has freed political prisoners and opened a closed society; a courageous dissident has been elected to Parliament; and people look forward to further reform. Around the globe, people are making their voices heard, insisting on their innate dignity, and the right to determine their future.</p> <p>And yet the turmoil of recent weeks reminds us that the path to democracy does not end with the casting of a ballot. Nelson Mandela once said: \"to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others.\" True democracy demands that citizens cannot be thrown in jail because of what they believe, and businesses can be opened without paying a bribe. It depends on the freedom of citizens to speak their minds and assemble without fear; on the rule of law and due process that guarantees the rights of all people.</p> <p>In other words, true democracy \u2013 real freedom \u2013 is hard work. Those in power have to resist the temptation to crack down on dissent. In hard economic times, countries may be tempted to rally the people around perceived enemies, at home and abroad, rather than focusing on the painstaking work of reform.</p> <p>Moreover, there will always be those that reject human progress \u2013 dictators who cling to power, corrupt interests that depend upon the status quo; and extremists who fan the flames of hate and division. From Northern Ireland to South Asia; from Africa to the Americas; from the Balkans to the Pacific Rim, we've witnessed convulsions that can accompany transitions to a new political order. At times, the conflicts arise along the fault lines of faith, race or tribe; and often they arise from the difficulties of reconciling tradition and faith with the diversity and interdependence of the modern world. In every country, there are those who find different religious beliefs threatening; in every culture, those who love freedom for themselves must ask how much they are willing to tolerate freedom for others.</p> <p>That is what we saw play out the last two weeks, as a crude and disgusting video sparked outrage throughout the Muslim world. I have made it clear that the United States government had nothing to do with this video, and I believe its message must be rejected by all who respect our common humanity. It is an insult not only to Muslims, but to America as well \u2013 for as the city outside these walls makes clear, we are a country that has welcomed people of every race and religion. We are home to Muslims who worship across our country. We not only respect the freedom of religion \u2013 we have laws that protect individuals from being harmed because of how they look or what they believe. We understand why people take offense to this video because millions of our citizens are among them.</p> <p>I know there are some who ask why we don't just ban such a video. The answer is enshrined in our laws: our Constitution protects the right to practice free speech. Here in the United States, countless publications provoke offense. Like me, the majority of Americans are Christian, and yet we do not ban blasphemy against our most sacred beliefs. Moreover, as President of our country, and Commander-in-Chief of our military, I accept that people are going to call me awful things every day, and I will always defend their right to do so. Americans have fought and died around the globe to protect the right of all people to express their views \u2013 even views that we disagree with.</p> <p>We do so not because we support hateful speech, but because our Founders understood that without such protections, the capacity of each individual to express their own views, and practice their own faith, may be threatened. We do so because in a diverse society, efforts to restrict speech can become a tool to silence critics, or oppress minorities. We do so because given the power of faith in our lives, and the passion that religious differences can inflame, the strongest weapon against hateful speech is not repression, it is more speech \u2013 the voices of tolerance that rally against bigotry and blasphemy, and lift up the values of understanding and mutual respect.</p> <p>I know that not all countries in this body share this understanding of the protection of free speech. Yet in 2012, at a time when anyone with a cell phone can spread offensive views around the world with the click of a button, the notion that we can control the flow of information is obsolete. The question, then, is how we respond. And on this we must agree: there is no speech that justifies mindless violence.</p> <p>There are no words that excuse the killing of innocents. There is no video that justifies an attack on an Embassy. There is no slander that provides an excuse for people to burn a restaurant in Lebanon, or destroy a school in Tunis, or cause death and destruction in Pakistan.</p> <p>More broadly, the events of the last two weeks speak to the need for all of us to address honestly the tensions between the West and an Arab World moving to democracy. Just as we cannot solve every problem in the world, the United States has not, and will not, seek to dictate the outcome of democratic transitions abroad, and we do not expect other nations to agree with us on every issue. Nor do we assume that the violence of the past weeks, or the hateful speech by some individuals, represents the views of the overwhelming majority of Muslims\u2013 any more than the views of the people who produced this video represent those of Americans.</p> <p>However, I do believe that it is the obligation of all leaders, in all countries, to speak out forcefully against violence and extremism. It is time to marginalize those who \u2013 even when not resorting to violence \u2013 use hatred of America, or the West, or Israel as a central principle of politics. For that only gives cover, and sometimes makes excuses, for those who resort to violence.</p> <p>That brand of politics \u2013 one that pits East against West; South against North; Muslim against Christian, Hindu, and Jew \u2013 cannot deliver the promise of freedom. To the youth, it offers only false hope. Burning an American flag will do nothing to educate a child. Smashing apart a restaurant will not fill an empty stomach. Attacking an Embassy won't create a single job. That brand of politics only makes it harder to achieve what we must do together: educating our children and creating the opportunities they deserve; protecting human rights, and extending democracy's promise.</p> <p>Understand that America will never retreat from the world. We will bring justice to those who harm our citizens and our friends. We will stand with our allies and are willing to partner with countries to deepen ties of trade and investment; science and technology; energy and development \u2013 efforts that can spark economic growth for all of our people, and stabilize democratic change. But such efforts depend upon a spirit of mutual interest and mutual respect. No government or company; no school or NGO will be confident working in a country where its people are endangered. For partnership to be effective, our citizens must be secure and our efforts must be welcomed.</p> <p>A politics based only on anger \u2013one based on dividing the world between us and them \u2013 not only sets back international cooperation, it ultimately undermines those who tolerate it. All of us have an interest in standing up to these forces. Let us remember that Muslims have suffered the most at the hands of extremism. On the same day our civilians were killed in Benghazi, a Turkish police officer was murdered in Istanbul only days before his wedding; more than ten Yemenis were killed in a car bomb in Sana'a; and several Afghan children were mourned by their parents just days after they were killed by a suicide bomber in Kabul.</p> <p>The impulse towards intolerance and violence may initially be focused on the West, but over time it cannot be contained. The same impulses toward extremism are used to justify war between Sunnis and Shia, between tribes and clans. It leads not to strength and prosperity but to chaos. In less than two years, we have seen largely peaceful protests bring more change to Muslim-majority countries than a decade of violence. Extremists understand this. And because they have nothing to offer to improve the lives of people, violence is their only way to stay relevant. They do not build, they only destroy.</p> <p>It is time to leave the call of violence and the politics of division behind. On so many issues, we face a choice between the promise of the future, or the prisons of the past. We cannot afford to get it wrong. We must seize this moment. And America stands ready to work with all who are willing to embrace a better future.</p> <p>The future must not belong to those who target Coptic Christians in Egypt \u2013 it must be claimed by those in Tahrir Square who chanted \"Muslims, Christians, we are one.\" The future must not belong to those who bully women \u2013 it must be shaped by girls who go to school, and those who stand for a world where our daughters can live their dreams just like our sons. The future must not belong to those corrupt few who steal a country's resources \u2013 it must be won by the students and entrepreneurs; workers and business owners who seek a broader prosperity for all people. Those are the men and women that America stands with; theirs is the vision we will support.</p> <p>The future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam. Yet to be credible, those who condemn that slander must also condemn the hate we see when the image of Jesus Christ is desecrated, churches are destroyed, or the Holocaust is denied. Let us condemn incitement against Sufi Muslims, and Shiite pilgrims. It is time to heed the words of Gandhi: \"Intolerance is itself a form of violence and an obstacle to the growth of a true democratic spirit.\" Together, we must work towards a world where we are strengthened by our differences, and not defined by them. That is what America embodies, and that is the vision we will support.</p> <p>Among Israelis and Palestinians, the future must not belong to those who turn their backs on the prospect of peace. Let us leave behind those who thrive on conflict, and those who reject the right of Israel to exist. The road is hard but the destination is clear \u2013 a secure, Jewish state of Israel; and an independent, prosperous Palestine. Understanding that such a peace must come through a just agreement between the parties, America will walk alongside all who are prepared to make that journey.</p> <p>In Syria, the future must not belong to a dictator who massacres his people. If there is a cause that cries out for protest in the world today, it is a regime that tortures children and shoots rockets at apartment buildings. And we must remain engaged to assure that what began with citizens demanding their rights does not end in a cycle of sectarian violence.</p> <p>Together, we must stand with those Syrians who believe in a different vision \u2013 a Syria that is united and inclusive; where children don't need to fear their own government, and all Syrians have a say in how they are governed \u2013 Sunnis and Alawites; Kurds and Christians. That is what America stands for; that is the outcome that we will work for \u2013 with sanctions and consequences for those who persecute; and assistance and support for those who work for this common good. Because we believe that the Syrians who embrace this vision will have the strength and legitimacy to lead.</p> <p>In Iran, we see where the path of a violent and unaccountable ideology leads. The Iranian people have a remarkable and ancient history, and many Iranians wish to enjoy peace and prosperity alongside their neighbors. But just as it restricts the rights of its own people, the Iranian government props up a dictator in Damascus and supports terrorist groups abroad. Time and again, it has failed to take the opportunity to demonstrate that its nuclear program is peaceful, and to meet its obligations to the United Nations.</p> <p>Let me be clear: America wants to resolve this issue through diplomacy, and we believe that there is still time and space to do so. But that time is not unlimited. We respect the right of nations to access peaceful nuclear power, but one of the purposes of the United Nations is to see that we harness that power for peace. Make no mistake: a nuclear-armed Iran is not a challenge that can be contained. It would threaten the elimination of Israel, the security of Gulf nations, and the stability of the global economy. It risks triggering a nuclear-arms race in the region, and the unraveling of the non-proliferation treaty. That is why a coalition of countries is holding the Iranian government accountable. And that is why the United States will do what we must to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.</p> <p>We know from painful experience that the path to security and prosperity does not lie outside the boundaries of international law and respect for human rights. That is why this institution was established from the rubble of conflict; that is why liberty triumphed over tyranny in the Cold War; and that is the lesson of the last two decades as well. History shows that peace and progress come to those who make the right choices.</p> <p>Nations in every part of the world have travelled this hard path. Europe \u2013 the bloodiest battlefield of the 20th century \u2013 is united, free and at peace. From Brazil to South Africa; from Turkey to South Korea; from India to Indonesia; people of different races, religions, and traditions have lifted millions out of poverty, while respecting the rights of their citizens and meeting their responsibilities as nations. </p> <p>And it is because of the progress I've witnessed that after nearly four years as President, I am hopeful about the world we live in. The war in Iraq is over, and our troops have come home. We have begun a transition in Afghanistan, and America and our allies will end our war on schedule in 2014. Al Qaeda has been weakened and Osama bin Laden is no more. Nations have come together to lock down nuclear materials, and America and Russia are reducing our arsenals. I've seen hard choices made \u2013 from Naypyidaw to Cairo to Abidjan \u2013 to put more power in the hands of citizens.</p> <p>At a time of economic challenge, the world has come together to broaden prosperity. Through the G-20, we have partnered with emerging countries to keep the world on the path of recovery. America has pursued a development agenda that fuels growth and breaks dependency, and worked with African leaders to help them feed their nations. New partnerships have been forged to combat corruption and promote government that is open and transparent. New commitments have been made through the Equal Futures Partnership to ensure that women and girls can fully participate in politics and pursue opportunity. And later today, I will discuss our efforts to combat the scourge of human trafficking.</p> <p>But what gives me the most hope is not the actions of leaders \u2013 it is the people I've seen. The American troops who have risked their lives and sacrificed their limbs for strangers half a world away. The students in Jakarta and Seoul who are eager to use their knowledge to benefit humankind. The faces in a square in Prague or a parliament in Ghana who see democracy giving voice to their aspirations. The young people in the favelas of Rio and the schools of Mumbai whose eyes shine with promise. These men, women and children of every race and every faith remind me that for every angry mob that gets shown on television, there are billions around the globe who share similar hopes and dreams. They tell us that there is a common heartbeat to humanity.</p> <p>So much attention in our world turns to what divides us. That's what we see on the news, and that consumes our political debates. But when you strip that all away, people everywhere long for the freedom to determine their destiny; the dignity that comes with work; the comfort that comes from faith; and the justice that exists when governments serve their people \u2013 and not the other way around.</p> <p>The United States of America will always stand up for these aspirations, for our own people, and all across the world. That was our founding purpose. That is what our history shows. And that is what Chris Stevens worked for throughout his life.</p> <p>And today I promise you this \u2013 long after these killers are brought to justice, Chris Stevens' legacy will live on in the lives he touched. In the tens of thousands who marched against violence through the streets of Benghazi; in the Libyans who changed their Facebook FB 0.00% photo to one of Chris; in the sign that read, simply, \"Chris Stevens was a friend to all Libyans.\"</p> <p>They should give us hope. They should remind us that so long as we work for it justice will be done; that history is on our side; and that a rising tide of liberty will never be reversed. Thank you.</p>",
  "<p>Not voting in the age of Obama has become almost a taboo subject among African Americans. After record black voter turnout helped elect the nation's first black president in 2008, the decision not to vote is regarded by many as an affront to the ancestors who died and activists who bled to exercise this right.</p> <p>\"They are not worth the color if they don't vote. They oughta give us their color back. Their African-American credentials should be snatched if they don't vote,\" proclaimed an impassioned Representative Emanuel Cleaver (Democrat, Missouri) in his address to the 42nd annual legislative conference of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation before the <a href=\"http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/308294-1\">\"voting rights and new age discrimination\"</a> panel.</p> <p>The sense of community responsibility to vote is all the more palpable leading into the November presidential election \u2013 as 17 states passed voter identification laws that would place restrictions on the quarter of the black population that does not hold a form of government-issued ID. In 2012, voting rights have become a resurgent civil rights issue, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/22/michelle-obama-congressional-black-caucus-speech_n_1906631.html?ncid=edlinkusaolp00000003\">prompting First Lady Michelle Obama to call</a> it \"the march or our time\" and \"the sit-in of our day\". While attempts to obstruct voting by African Americans attest to the community's voting power, voter suppression laws serve as painful reminder of the disenfranchisement they perpetually face, even 150 years after the Emancipation Proclamation.</p> <p>Institutional discrimination has historically driven black voter apathy, which remains an intangible, submerged fact permeating the lives of African Americans unable to see how their voice matters in America. The current challenges for black Americans \u2013 an above-average 14% unemployment rate, more than 27% living in poverty, violence and crime increasing steadily, alongside mortgage foreclosures and debt, and racialized law enforcement initiatives such as \"stop-and-frisk\" \u2013 lead some to feel the need for survival may usurp the right to vote. <a href=\"http://www.theroot.com/users/josiepickens\">Writer and Ebony.com contributor Josie Pickens says</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"That apathy is more common than we'd care to admit- that feeling of powerlessness \u2026 we must also examine a political system that makes its own citizens feel unrepresented and ignored.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The poll taxes and literacy tests that discouraged the \"negro vote\" in a segregated country a century ago have mutated into the voter ID laws and recessionary pressures that deter African Americans from exercising their voting rights in an increasingly polarized political environment. Besides apathy, there is also active resistance from black Americans, who abstain from participating in a flawed political system in which they believe each party serves to oppress and not empower its citizens. Ferrari Sheppard, artist and independent journalist, expresses his reasons for not voting thus:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The United States [is] run by banks and global elite, presidents and other so-called elected officials are nothing more than customer service representatives, entertaining and lulling the masses to sleep. I refuse to play their game.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Disillusionment with the system finds historical resonance in the political evolution of the renowned African-American scholar, WEB Du Bois, who pivoted from advocating the vote in 1903, to abstentionism in 1956. In his essay, <a href=\"http://www.blackeconomicdevelopment.com/why-i-wont-vote-by-web-du-bois-the-nation-20-october-1956/\">\"Why I Won't Vote\"</a>, published in the Nation in 1956, Du Bois' scathing critique of corporate greed and its influence on politics, of the lack of affordable healthcare, of racial disparities, and of warmongering reads like a manifesto for modern-day popular <a href=\"http://www.officialoccupythehood.org/\">movements like Occupy the Hood</a>. </p> <p>While the abstentionist critique of voting is rooted in a tradition of black American radicalism, it remains \u2013 along with apathy \u2013 a hotly-contested topic of community discussion, as was recently evidenced by the <a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1694167/lupe-fiasco-roland-martin-voting-twitter-debate.jhtml\">Twitter debate</a> between Chicago rapper Lupe Fiasco and CNN contributor Roland S Martin. Tweets variously denouncing Lupe as a \"clown\", praising this decision to abstain, and supporting his political freedom to choose, exposed a myriad of diverging opinions on how African Americans can create substantive change inside and outside of government.</p> <p>In his famous speech <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9BVEnEsn6Y&amp;feature=related\">\"The Ballot or the Bullet\"</a>, Malcolm X simultaneously encouraged blacks Americans to form a unified bloc that could serve as a swing vote and expressed skepticism that voting could bring about equality.&#xa0;That lecture, delivered nearly 50 years ago, still captures much of the complexity of the black voting landscape today.</p> <p>For many African-American non-voters, whether they are alienated into apathy or willfully abstain, the legacy of black inequity is inescapable, even in the era of an African-American president. So some still ask: we are in this country, but are we of this country?</p>",
  "<p>As America's elections approach, with President Barack Obama slightly in front of his Republican challenger, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, pollsters still rate the races for control of the presidency and the United States Senate too close to call, with the House of Representatives likely to remain in Republican hands. The differences between the candidates are considerable, and highly consequential for American economic policy and the global economy, although enactment of their programmes will depend on the makeup of Congress.</p> <p>The most important differences between the two candidates can be summarised as follows:</p> <p><strong>Spending</strong>: Obama has dramatically increased spending. He would likely continue many of his temporary programmes (as Milton Friedman once observed, \"There is nothing so permanent as a temporary government programme.\"); double down on having government pick winners and losers in green energy; expand spending on education and infrastructure; and substantially reduce defence expenditures.</p> <p>Romney, by contrast, favours limiting overall federal spending, currently 24% of GDP, to 20%, and keeping defence at 4%. He wants private markets, not government, to choose winning firms and technologies.</p> <p>Democrats oppose most non-defence spending cuts, arguing that reductions would cause the economy to contract. That case is strongest if the spending reductions are large and abrupt in a weak economy. If phased in over a multi-year period as the economy recovers, as Romney proposes, thrift would likely be expansionary. For example, federal spending relative to GDP fell by five percentage points from the mid-1980s to the late 1990s in the US, and by an even larger margin in recent decades in Canada \u2013 that is, through periods of strong economic growth.</p> <p><strong>Taxes</strong>: Obama would raise the top marginal tax rates on wages, capital gains, dividends, interest, and estates, especially on higher-income individuals and small businesses. Yet he has never proposed comprehensive reform of either the personal or corporate income tax.</p> <p>By contrast, Romney would reduce America's corporate tax rate (the highest in the OECD) to 25% and tax American multinationals on a territorial, rather than a worldwide, basis in order to increase their tax competitiveness. He would also lower personal tax rates by 20%, and make up lost revenue by limiting tax deductions and credits, particularly at the upper end, thereby raising about 18.5% of GDP, just above the historical average, at full employment. Romney's fiscal plan thus reduces deficits sufficiently to decrease the debt-to-GDP ratio. He favours a balanced budget amendment to the constitution, and hopes to balance the budget over eight years.</p> <p>Obama, by contrast, would run larger deficits \u2013 his spending increase is much larger than his tax increase \u2013 which imply large tax hikes in the future. Moreover, he would run far larger debt ratios than Romney, because the main driver of the debt is entitlement spending.</p> <p><strong>Entitlements</strong>: Obama has remained silent about reform of Medicare and social security, whose long-run deficits are several times the national debt. Vice President Joe Biden has even said that \"no changes\" to social security are to be made.</p> <p>Romney supports gradually increasing retirement ages, a premium-support model for Medicare, and shifting Medicaid (health insurance for the poor) to the states via block grants. The Obama campaign is pummelling Romney on Medicare, and the Romney campaign is hammering Obama for his refusal to negotiate or even propose a solution.</p> <p>The Obama policy would thus lead to ever-higher deficits and debt ratios well over 100% of GDP, a level that numerous studies imply would reduce US economic growth by one-third or more and might induce a sovereign debt crisis. Some observers suggest that Obama's unspoken plan is ever-growing entitlements eventually paid for by a European-style value-added tax.</p> <p><strong>Trade</strong>: Obama is the first US president in a long time who has not played a leading role on global trade liberalization. The Doha Round of global trade talks remains stalled, and Obama delayed the three bilateral free-trade agreements that awaited approval when he came into office. Romney is a proponent of free trade, but has said that he would be tougher on China's trade practices and currency policies.</p> <p><strong>Regulation</strong>: Obama wants to expand federal command-and-control regulation further (though the courts have stopped his extension of some regulatory powers). Romney vows an economically balanced approach that would reform Obama's major health-care, environmental, and financial-services regulations.</p> <p><strong>Appointments</strong>: Every US president appoints thousands of officials, many with considerable power. Romney has said that he would not reappoint Ben Bernanke as Fed chairman (likely candidates: economists Glenn Hubbard, Greg Mankiw, John Taylor, and Martin Feldstein). Other presidential appointees exert considerable influence on firms, industries, or the entire economy. For example, Obama's appointees to the obscure National Labor Relations Board tried to prevent Boeing from expanding in South Carolina, despite the state's anti-union \"right to work\" legislation.</p> <p>These policies would affect US economic growth, the budget deficit, national saving, and hence global trade and capital flows. With larger deficits under Obama than under Romney, America would need more capital from Europe, Latin America, and Asia, while higher taxes and debt would impede US growth and thus undermine these regions' exports. Obama would steer America in the direction of European social-welfare states; Romney's agenda is designed to prevent that.</p> <p>Whoever wins, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/02/imf-us-fiscal-cliff-global-economy?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">a fiscal cliff looms at the end of 2012</a>. Previous legislation, if not reversed, will lead to large abrupt tax hikes and spending cuts, which the Congressional Budget Office forecasts would likely cause a recession in 2013. While a post-election, lame-duck session of Congress will address the fiscal cliff, the deep differences between Republicans and Democrats on taxes and spending remain wide and difficult to bridge.</p> <p>With uncertainty plaguing Europe's finances and China slowing, the last thing the global economy needs is a stagnant or shrinking US economy. But it will take strong leadership by the president-elect to avoid it.</p> <p>Copyright: <a href=\"www.project-syndicate.org\" title=\"\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2012.</p>",
  "<p>No matter where you go in the world, few things convey welcome or acceptance quite like being given a mouthful of sausage, a juicy fresh piece of fruit, a chunk of a homemade sweet. But in America, the passing of snacks isn't just a social nicety: when election time rolls around, the processed meat is political. And as the days until the 2012 presidential face-off tick away, I can't help but spare a thought not just for the digestion of my preferred candidate, but for the other guy, too. Heartburn bridges the party divide.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396840742\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348566528124/US-Democratic-presidentia-001.jpg\" alt=\"US Democratic presidential candidate Obama eating chicken\" width=\"210\" height=\"192\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eating a frog leg in Indiana in 2008.

The tradition seems to have started way back in the early 19th century, when Andrew Jackson was asked to smooch what was, by some accounts, an <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/media/2012/01/politicians-kissing-babies-brief-history\" title=\"\">unappealing baby</a> (Jackson apparently pawned the job off on his war secretary).</p> <p>But baby-kissing soon became insufficient as a motif to prove how kind and normal our leaders were; public eating was soon added to the list of requirements. <a href=\"http://lincolnslunch.blogspot.co.uk/2010/10/franklin-roosevelts-royal-hot-dog_1084.html\" title=\"\">Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a> threw down the gauntlet by being photographed noshing a hot dog. Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton <a href=\"http://www.roadsideamerica.com/tip/13041\" title=\"\">took it</a> to the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/23/garden/bill-clinton-and-food-jack-sprat-he-s-not.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm\" title=\"\">next level</a> with their lusty public consumption of McDonald's. And this year's election feels like an eating contest to beat all others.</p> <p>As the internet explodes with images of Barack Obama and Mitt Romney traveling from coast to coast (or rather from swing state to swing state) enjoying old-fashioned local snacks and bags of fast food, one wonders: is this race man versus man, or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2012/jun/16/man-v-food-adam-richman\" title=\"\">Man v Food</a>? What a strange horror! Here you are, with what you think are some really smart ideas about changing the course of history through holding America's highest office. But to get there, you have to consume all of the country's lowest foods on camera? It's punishing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396840743\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348575259255/Barack-Obama-001.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama\" width=\"210\" height=\"246\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Buying a chili bowl in Washington. Photograph: AP Photo/Gerald Herbert </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerald Herbert/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some time ago I decided that there are two kinds of people in the world: people who will eat two dinners in one night, and people who will not. Not by coincidence, I decided this on a night when I was suffering the effects of having eaten two dinners. An error of scheduling happened and when I found myself in the second location facing the second plate, I thought: \"Would it be worse to eat again and feel disgusting or to hurt this person's feelings?\" I picked feeling disgusting, because a two-dinner person cares more about her companions than her digestion.</p> <p>And ever since that unpleasant evening I've understood that overeating to make other people happy is not just an exercise in gluttony; it's a measure of one's generosity of spirit. Every time another American patriot hands a presidential candidate another deep-fried regional dish for his delectation, knowing fully he's just had to eat a burger down the street, the gesture isn't just saying: \"Welcome to town, try this local thousand-calorie delicacy\"; it's a crucial and maybe even cruel test, saying: \"What's more important: your acid reflux, or America's feelings?\"</p> <p>You would hope that noshing doesn't really swing votes. If Obama came round to my home and declined a piece of pie (apple, obviously), I guess I would feel a little put out, but I'd still vote for him. And even if Romney could <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/mckaycoppins/mitt-romney-struggles-to-identify-a-donut\" title=\"\">correctly identify a doughnut</a>, I would find him appalling. But it's only human to spare a thought for both of them in the face of their unremitting onslaught of snacks.</p> <p>When Ann Romney declared the other day that Republicans who think her husband's not trying hard enough should \"get in the ring\", some would have thought that she was trying to use a boxing metaphor. But I bet she was really thinking about Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest. And thus, while I can't stomach his views on policy, I raise a glass (small plastic measuring cup) of Pepto-Bismol to Romney and the road he's travelling. For I suspect it's paved not just with failure, but with indigestion.</p>",
  "<p>The UK government has spent millions of pounds on training military, police and security personnel from oppressive regimes that have arms embargoes in place, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>In the last five years, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo have received from the UK government \u00a32.4m between them in training and support for military and defence personnel.</p> <p>Sudan is the only country in the world where the sitting president, Omar al-Bashir, has been indicted for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity by the international criminal court, while in Congo extensive human rights abuses, including extra-judicial killings and torture, have been documented.</p> <p><a href=\"http://enoughproject.org/\" title=\"\">The Enough Project</a>, which works with the American actor George Clooney to expose human rights abuses in both Sudan and Congo, says the two countries are the scene of some of the world's most serious mass atrocities.</p> <p>In information revealed in a <a href=\"http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/FreedomOfInformation/DisclosureLog/\" title=\"\">freedom of information response from the Ministry of Defence</a> a total of \u00a375,406 has been spent on providing 44-week courses at the elite Royal Military Academy Sandhurst for Sudanese and Congolese forces. Other support includes military logistics, advanced command and staff courses, strategic intelligence and evaluating challenges to state sovereignty.</p> <p>A total of \u00a3952,301 was spent on international peace support, which includes border security and stabilisation.</p> <p>Much of the current focus of concern about human rights abuses in Sudan centres on conflict in the border areas with the newly formed country of South Sudan, such as Blue Nile, Nuba Mountains and South Kordofan, and the ongoing conflict in Darfur, where documented genocide shows 300,000 Darfuris have been killed and up to 4 million displaced. The Sudanese government has refused humanitarian aid access to the border areas.</p> <p>In Congo many and varied human rights abuses have been documented, especially against opponents of the president, Joseph Kabila. A UN report earlier this year highlighted \"serious human rights violations, including killings, disappearances and arbitrary detentions\" during last November's presidential elections. At least 33 people were killed by government forces during the elections, and hundreds were arrested and said they had been tortured. A delegation of UK officials has been investigating claims of torture in Congo and is due to report back shortly.</p> <p>A leading Sudanese exile based in the UK, Dr Gebreil Fediel from Darfur, is challenging the legality of the UK government's relationship with Sudan in the high court next month.</p> <p>His legal team is bringing enforcement proceedings against the government for failing to provide him with protection under the refugee convention and travel documents to enable him to attend peace talks around the world. These talks aim to bring an end to the appalling human rights situation in Sudan. He is the leader of a major Sudanese opposition movement, the Justice and Equality Movement.</p> <p>The high court judge Mr Justice Wyn Williams described the government's approach to Fediel as \"unreasonably restrictive\" in January of this year.</p> <p>In a statement to the court Fediel accused the government of failing to provide him with protection because there was a deal between the two governments.</p> <p>\"I believe the government of Sudan is requesting the UK government to treat me like this for political reasons. Their decisions to exclude and restrict me are underpinned by political and intelligence considerations.\"</p> <p>He expressed concern about the military support and training provided by the UK: \"If it was and is the intention of the UK authorities to teach Sudan's police and security officers how to conduct these matters in a democratic manner, it has failed. The brutality and genocidal activities of government of Sudan state organs against its own citizens is widely documented.\"</p> <p>In July the Foreign Office minister Lord Howell admitted about Sudan: \"There is ample evidence that the military tactics being used raise concerns that the most serious crimes of concern to the international community may be being committed.\"</p> <p>Fediel said that as well as the UK's provision of military support to his government the UK had also been providing support and training to Sudanese police and security officials. He said that in May a group of senior police officers came to the UK for training.</p> <p>A letter from the former Foreign Office minister Ivan Lewis in 2010 stated: \"The UK has a large police support programme in Democratic Republic of the Congo.\"</p> <p>Aaron Hall, the associate director of research for the Enough Project, said: \"We would hope that any nation providing military and security support to these countries would have conditions attached to that support based on the adherence to international human rights laws and standards. If credible evidence exists that shows violation of those laws and standards whether within those countries borders or externally, we would urge those governments providing support to immediately suspend that support, and further to work with international and regional partners to hold those responsible for human rights abuses accountable for their actions.\"</p> <p>Jovanka Savic, Fediel's solicitor, said: \"There is an obligation under international law that requires states to bring to an end breaches of international law through legal means. This new evidence suggests that the UK is not helping to do this but is instead giving aid and assistance to the Sudanese government in a way that could be in breach of its international legal obligations. It is very concerning that support is being offered to DRC where many human rights abuses have been documented.\"</p> <p>She said the UK's actions against Fediel, in preventing or restricting him from attending peace talks around the world, was helping to prolong the human suffering and conflict in Sudan.</p> <p>\"They are making this man's life very difficult for political and arguably illegal reasons,\" she said.</p> <p>The government provided a response from four departments \u2013 the Home Office, the Ministry of Defence, the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development.</p> <p>A spokesman said: \"Strict criteria are applied to any training to ensure that it complies with overseas security and assistance human rights guidance. For each funding decision an assessment of the risk of human rights abuses is carried out. Her Majesty's government conducts continual assessment of its programmes and human rights compliance is a cardinal criterion of this.</p> <p>\"UK officials have contact with international criminal court indictees only when this is considered essential and on a case-by-case basis. No contact with President Bashir has come about as a result of these programmes.\"</p> <p>However, the spokesman confirmed that some meetings had taken place between the previous and present ambassador to Sudan and Bashir. \"The main occasions are when a British ambassador leaves or takes up their post in Khartoum.\"</p> <p>The spokesman said that international peace support was delivered to UN peacekeeping missions in Sudan and South Sudan and funding was provided for the African Union panel leading the talks aimed at ending the conflict.</p> <p>He confirmed that nine senior national police officers from Sudan visited London in May to learn about policing and human rights in the UK, two of whom held the rank of major general. \"The officers met the Sudanese ambassador at his London office as a protocol courtesy.\" He said that community policing initiatives had been set up following the officers' return to Sudan.</p> <h2>The reaction from Africa </h2> <p>Studies have shown that Congolese soldiers are responsible for at least 60% of reported rapes in the country. Last year the UN implicated them in the rape of at least 121 women over three days in the village of Nyakiele, in South Kivu province. This came after the gang-rape of at least 47 women by government troops in North Kivu.</p> <p>The UN's high commissioner for human rights has said: \"The Congolese army remains responsible for a significant number of human rights violations, including sexual violence.''</p> <p>The opposition Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS) was at the sharp end of last year's election crackdown and claims soldiers were used to intimidate voters and interfere with ballot papers. It expressed concern at the use of British resources to train and support the military.</p> <p>Albert Moleka, the party's cabinet director and spokesman, said: \"Training is a normal part of the co-operation of our two countries but we might say it is the responsibility of the DRC to use those who have been trained properly. That can only be done by a legitimate political authority. Unfortunately we don't have a legitimate political authority. There is a huge gap of mistrust between the army and the population.\"</p> <p>He added: \"In our experience it is the elite troops with the best equipment who are used against the population. I think military co-operation should be attached with strict conditions that ensure force is never used against the people. That is difficult for outside countries to monitor.\"</p> <p>Moleka said there was a long tradition of Congo's military elite studying at academies in Britain and other foreign countries. \"But when they come back, what functions do they occupy? How can they help their country? They're not given the opportunity to bring what they learn to change the attitudes and behaviour of the army.\"</p> <p>The Congolese army, badly paid and fed, is still struggling to maintain discipline after the integration of a Tutsi rebel militia following a 2009 peace treaty. Yet the international community, including the world's biggest UN peacekeeping operation, has put faith in it to quell violence in the country's war-torn east.</p> <p>In May, Human Rights Watch reported that Sudanese government forces were carrying out indiscriminate bombings and abuses against civilians in southern Kordofan. It called on Sudan to investigate the discovery of a cluster bomb in the region. Witnesses interviewed in Blue Nile also described serious abuses by the armed forces. The onslaughts have <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/new-arrivals-in-south-sudan-tell-of-worst-war-crimes-since-darfur-7965160.html\" title=\"\">created tens of thousands of refugees living in appalling conditions</a>.</p> <p>John Ashworth, a church adviser who has lived in Sudan and South Sudan for three decades, said: \"While one might argue that helping an army to maintain professional standards could improve their human rights record, this is clearly not the case with the Sudanese army, which continues to commit atrocities against civilians in Darfur, the Nuba Mountains and Blue Nile, and continues to threaten its new neighbour, South Sudan.\"</p> <p>Ishag Mekki, a Darfur refugee in Britain who campaigns for the region, said: \"It is shame that the UK government behaves irresponsibly and assists a war crime government. It is an ethical matter not to stand firmly with victims of both countries. I am annoyed seeing ministers and government officials visit the UK on a regular basis for various businesses, but to train them is shocking. It means the people of Darfur will have to wait very long to persuade this government to change their mind.\"</p> <p>Pascal Kambale, DRC country director of the Open Society Initiative for West Africa, said: \"I don't think this is appropriate at all. The Congolese army badly needs complete reform and western donors \u2013 including the UK \u2013 have completely failed on their promise to help the Congolese government's effort to reform its army. Throwing this kind of big money into training not only is not in line with security sector reform programmes. It is also counterproductive because it comforts the Congo government into its lack of interest in reforming its army.\"</p>"
