  "<p>Jacob Zuma, the president of South Africa, could be ousted later this year after what has been described as \"a string of unbelievable errors\" in his handling of the mine massacre that <a href=\"http://dailymaverick.co.za/article/2012-08-20-marikana-massacre-global-medias-focus-on-tripartite-failures-and-the-growing-class-divide]\" title=\"\">shocked viewers around the world</a>.</p> <p>Zuma is facing criticism for a sluggish response to one of post-apartheid South Africa's biggest disasters, in which 34 striking <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/16/south-african-police-shoot-striking-miners\" title=\"\">mineworkers were gunned down</a> by police. With factionalism rampant in the governing party, some believe the episode could tip the balance against him when he <a href=\"http://www.citypress.co.za/Politics/News/Its-a-three-horse-race-comrades-20120811\" title=\"\">seeks re-election</a> at an African National Congress (ANC) conference in December.</p> <p>Critics say that in the hours after the bloodshed at the Marikana platinum mine in the north-west of the country, Zuma was slow to return to South Africa from a summit in neighbouring Mozambique. By the time he did reach the mine, it was \"too dark\" to address the angry mineworkers, he was <a href=\"http://www.timeslive.co.za/thetimes/2012/08/23/humble-zuma-gives-miners-a-hearing\" title=\"\">quoted as saying </a>last week.</p> <p>Instead the president visited survivors in hospital and read a prepared speech to journalists at a game lodge owned by Lonmin, the company that owns the mine, announcing a <a href=\"http://mg.co.za/article/2012-08-17-police-go-with-bravado-on-marikana\" title=\"\">commission of inquiry</a>. Many of those present described the address as flat.</p> <p>Rubbing salt into Zuma's wounds, his arch political enemy, Julius Malema, addressed the miners the following day, earning cheers as he accused Zuma of presiding over mass murder and called for him to resign. Zuma did speak to the mineworkers last week, but he failed to attend a memorial service, where the limelight was again stolen by Malema, the expelled president of the ANC youth league.</p> <p>The South African press has accused Zuma of misjudgment in his handling of the shootings. An <a href=\"http://www.timeslive.co.za/opinion/editorials/2012/08/23/zuma-needs-to-be-far-more-in-touch-with-south-africans\" title=\"\">editorial in the <em>Times</em></a> said: \"Being a leader comes with a responsibility and in this case the president, or his advisers, failed to read the mood. Sometimes a leader needs to suspend protocol and take charge of a situation in his country. Zuma's absence from the 'crime scene' gave others space.\"</p> <p>If history has shown that a major national crisis can make or break a presidency, the omens for Zuma are grim. Susan Booysen, a political scientist at Wits University in Johannesburg, said: \"A wise government takes pre-emptive steps and there had been danger signals for several weeks. Zuma didn't make a good impression by going to a private lodge. He only went to the miners' territory after Julius Malema had been there, so he came in on a weak wicket.</p> <p>\"It was a string of unbelievable errors that came together. I think that, on balance, he came across as weak. There is not much in Zuma's favour except the swift announcement of a commission of inquiry.\"</p> <p>Booysen, author of <em>The African National Congress and the Regeneration of Political Power</em>, added: \"Does it really matter? I think it does. If [deputy president] Kgalema Motlanthe becomes a candidate, this will be important. Opponents of Zuma will pull everything out of the closet to throw at him, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/23/mbeki.southafrica\" title=\"\">just like they did against President Thabo Mbeki</a>.\"</p> <p>Motlanthe, who served as interim president between Mbeki and Zuma, has not yet revealed his ambitions for the ANC elective conference in Mangaung. But in June he openly questioned Zuma's concept of a \"second transition\" for South Africa and <a href=\"http://mg.co.za/article/2012-06-21-flexes-his-muscles\" title=\"\">criticised aspects of the party leadership</a>.</p> <p>Zuma is seen as vulnerable over personal scandals, such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/31/jacob-zuma-south-africa-child\" title=\"\">fathering a child out of wedlock</a>, domestic plagues ranging from corruption to unemployment to non-delivery of school textbooks, and foreign policy controversies over the government's stand on the conflicts in Ivory Coast and Libya.</p> <p>Without a clear and popular rival, Zuma remains the favourite to lead the ANC into the next general election in 2014. He enjoys a powerful home base in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, the biggest ANC voting bloc, and <a href=\"http://www.sacp.org.za\" title=\"\">significant allies</a> such as the South African Communist party.</p> <p>However, some of the provinces, certain sections of the trade union movement and the ANC youth league may feel that they have received a boost for their candidate: <a href=\"http://www.fm.co.za/fm/2012/06/18/the-anyone-but-zuma-brigad\" title=\"\">\"Anyone but Zuma\"</a>.</p>",
  "<p>A lone man carrying a plastic bag calmly walked up to the shiny glass doors of the headquarters of Nelson Mandela's African National Congress in Johannesburg last Thursday. He pulled a piece of thick wood out of the bag and began pounding the doors. The man, reportedly in his early 30s, raved that he could not find a job despite the fact that he had a university degree.</p> <p>He is not the first, and will not be the last, to rage at South Africa's ruling party. According to the finance ministry, more than 40% of people under 30 are unemployed. Their lot is getting worse: employment among 18-to 24-year-olds has declined by more than 20% since 2008.</p> <p>Eighteen years after attaining its much-lauded democracy, South Africa is becoming what author William Gumede calls a \"restless nation\" marked by disillusionment, anger and protest, particularly among the young. In just the first seven months of this year, it recorded the highest number of protests it has had since 2004.</p> <p>The face of these protests is that of young people, the \"born frees\" \u2013 born after Mandela walked out of jail in 1990. For them, 18 years of democracy have not delivered the jobs and opportunities once promised by the ANC.</p> <p>In the wake of the Marikana mine shootings, will the cocktail of high unemployment, a young population and a ruling elite perceived to have lost touch with the masses lead to the conflagrations of Tunisia and Egypt? South Africa's average age is only 24 and its first-time voters in the next general election in 2014 will have been born two years after 1994 when blacks voted for the first time. They do not know what apartheid is, and many do not care.</p> <p>For the governing ANC this could be the beginning of the end. The party's hegemony has largely been born of its message to black South Africans that it was the party of liberation and of Mandela. However, for the \"born free\" this is an esoteric message for signs of its failures are all around: government failed to deliver textbooks to hundreds of thousands of young children this year, for example.</p> <p>Further, 83% of urban South Africans feel corruption has become a way of life, according to research by TNS South Africa. Their dreams have been deferred for 18 years. This fact is pushing more and more of the young towards the opposition Democratic Alliance, which has jumped from 1% support in 1994 to 23.9% in the last local elections. Its leader is more popular than ANC president Jacob Zuma.</p> <p>So what happens now? Former president Thabo Mbeki once quoted a Langston Hughes poem in relation to South Africa, asking what happens to a dream deferred. He concluded that it explodes.</p> <p><em>Justice Malala is a South African newspaper columnist and political commentator </em></p>",
  "<p>American party conventions, for all their razzmatazz, lack the drama of their fictional depictions, including <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057883/\" title=\"\"><em>The Best Man</em></a>, the 1964 film starring Henry Fonda and Cliff Robertson, a tale of skulduggery between two leading candidates for nomination that ends with both imploding.</p> <p>Sadly, there is no chance of similar drama in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/24/romney-speech-republican-national-convention?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Tampa, Florida</a>, when the Grand Old Party meets tomorrow. A piece of choreographed theatre, its function is to anoint Mitt Romney as the candidate in front of the Republican party's panjandrums and their wealthy backers. Over five days, 50,000 party faithful and 15,000 media will go through the motions towards a foregone conclusion.</p> <p>If the beef in this story is not about who will be the candidate to fight Obama in the autumn, it is about a different issue of identity, perhaps even more critical. What will be pored over during the coming days is an issue even the candidate cannot ignore \u2013 the question of precisely what his party is and represents today.</p> <p>In past conventions, both Democratic and Republican candidates have been able to stand aside from damaging ideas promoted by their party activists. This time, Romney, not least because of his choice of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/22/mitt-romney-paul-ryan?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Paul Ryan </a>as his running mate, will not have that luxury. A lacklustre candidate who has struggled to energise the base of a party that has, under the guidance of the Tea Party, lurched ever further right, Romney is caught on the horns of a dilemma. He cannot be seen to be disavowing his party's right wing too strongly, just as his political opponents will be earnestly studying the convention for fresh ammunition to discredit him.</p> <p>The reality is that the convention in Tampa will mark the end of a process that began in the last presidential election cycle with the rise of the Tea Party and the divisive figure of Sarah Palin, a movement whose strong influence within the party remains undiminished, despite questions, not least during the midterm elections two years ago, of how popular the movement was, and is, with the voters.</p> <p>Already there have been signs of the difficult course Romney will have to steer between electability and satisfying the Republican base. The recent repellent \u2013 and scientifically bizarre \u2013 remarks of Missouri's US Senate candidate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/24/todd-akin-remain-missouri-senate-race?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Todd Akin </a>about rape have framed his difficulties. For while the presidential candidate quickly called for Akin to withdraw from the race, he has had more difficulty extricating himself from the fact that his running mate Ryan has shared similar views to Akin on abortion.</p> <p>If that row has prefigured the convention, what will be discussed on the floor at Tampa is only likely to underline the damaging dynamics in the Republican party in an election year. The draft platform (usually something the candidate can quietly disregard) in circulation ahead of the meeting this year almost wilfully incorporates some of the most explosive potential issues in the coming weeks of the campaign. Described by the <em>New York Times </em>as a \"mean-spirited platform\" closer to the views of Paul Ryan than Romney, it is hostile to women's reproductive rights, immigration and gay marriage while embracing hardline Tea Party views on everything from national security to taxation.</p> <p>Controversially, a version of the draft acquired by CNN includes the commitment to an anti-abortion amendment to the constitution with no exemption for rape or incest, precisely Akin's position.</p> <p>And while its final shape has still to be determined it seems unlikely that Republican activists will \u2013 at the last moment \u2013 embrace a warmer and more centre right message.</p> <p>If content of the draft platform presents one risk to Romney, his own pitch, as it has been anticipated in the US media, is also a hazardous approach for a man who would defeat an incumbent to become president of the United States.</p> <p>It has been suggested that what Romney wants to emphasise is his record as a businessman, with the skills to turn the US economy around. This, in large part, is because his political history as governor of Massachusetts is littered with achievements, not least his version of state-mandated healthcare, that are anathema to a large part of his audience in Florida.</p> <p>The reality, as commentators such as Maureen Dowd in the <em>New York Times </em>have observed, is that the Republican core, despite the addition of Paul Ryan's fresh face, is \"ever more antediluvian, anti-women, anti-gay [and] conservative.\"</p> <p>Even on the issue of economic policy, the committee drafting the platform is looking thoroughly backward, appropriate perhaps for a party where members believe that dinosaurs and humans co-existed, to setting up a commission to consider linking the dollar to the gold standard.</p> <p>Which leaves Romney less room to manoeuvre than a candidate might like. While his tax plans and language on entitlement might cheer the base, he also needs to be attractive to a host of voting groups from single women to Democrat-leaning Hispanic voters currently put off by his party's language on immigration and older voters frightened over proposed changes to Medicare.</p> <p>The natural temptation for Romney should be to steer the party more closely to the safer central ground. But the evidence of the past few weeks, not least his selection of Ryan as running mate, suggests that is not on his mind. And if more evidence of which way Romney is leaning was required, it was provided last week in his off-the-cuff comments while visiting his native Michigan.</p> <p>Departing from script \u2013 his advisers say \u2013 he delivered <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/romney-jokes-about-his-birth-certificate-obama-campaign-accuses-him-of-embracing-birtherism/2012/08/24/bda35810-ee14-11e1-b0eb-dac6b50187ad_story.html\" title=\"\">a crude joke </a>that referenced the fallacious \"birther\" controversy that once fixated on the false notion that Obama was not born in Hawaii, but outside the US.</p> <p>That earned Romney a quick rebuke from the Obama campaign, accusing him of \"enlisting himself in the birther movement [that] should give pause to any rational voter across America\".</p> <p>In the final analysis, as the delegates begin to gather in Tampa, it is fair to say, as a general rule of politics, that parties get the candidates and the conferences they deserve. The capture of Republicanism by a base more interested in the narrow extremes of their own ideology rather than electability may cost them the election. Sadly, it also impoverishes the US political debate at a time when both sides should be looking for solutions to the country's pressing problems.</p>",
  "<p>Last year I began teaching a group of black South Africans at a Cape Town media project. <em>Live Magazine</em> is designed to give opportunities to young people from townships trying to find a route into South Africa's creative industries. As one of the professional mentors, I help the students make videos and tell stories from their communities about music, youth opinion and career advice.</p> <p>All my class are aspiring film-makers, writers, photographers and designers. For them it is an amazing opportunity to gain work experience. For me it has been a wonderful chance to discuss the hopes, dreams and frustrations of contemporary South Africa with young black people in a city that, 22 years after the end of apartheid, remains highly racially segregated. The young interns all come from different areas of Cape Town but share one crucial characteristic: they are trying to make their way in a society where youth unemployment is 45% and the economic situation shows no sign of improving.</p> <p>My students quickly started teaching me Xhosa and their complicated local youth handshake. I still get that wrong! One young man, Manez, even joked one day that they would make me African, but for now at least I did resemble the 61-year-old Helen Zille (the white leader of the Democratic Alliance opposition party) in my glasses. A bit cheeky really, since I'm in my mid-40s.</p> <p>Above all, from my point of view, the class was giving me a fascinating insight into the \"born free\" generation \u2013 those black people born after the tumultuous struggle by their parents against apartheid had been won.</p> <p>I moved from London to Cape Town in 2006 with my husband and our two young children. Twenty-five years ago, in the 1980s, I was a politically active student and marched against apartheid in those huge demonstrations which used to end up in Trafalgar Square. Later, as a 23-year-old in 1990, I partied hard with my friends when Nelson Mandela was released from prison.</p> <p>In those heady days, the exiled heroes of the African National Congress, the political force that led the anti-apartheid battle, returned to South Africa and most of the world believed that the change in people's lives would be enormous.</p> <p>Almost a quarter of a century later, the ANC is viewed very differently by my students. They all heard the stories of the battles fought by their parents' generation \"back in the day\". Many of them still feel a loyalty to the party that liberated them and cannot see a credible alternative to the ANC, which has enjoyed unbroken political power since 1994. But they are growing increasingly cynical and frustrated with the pace of real transformation in their lives and prospects.</p> <p>My students told me that they didn't trust President Jacob Zuma: they are turned off by the scandals involving his financial affairs; they disapprove of his decision to embrace Zulu polygamy and take four wives. A sizeable number prefer Julius Malema, the firebrand ANC youth leader, who was expelled from the party after controversial remarks about the ANC's leadership. He might be a rabble-rouser, but at least he is challenging the ideas of a complacent ruling party.</p> <p>The Lonmin shootings in which 34 mineworkers were killed when police opened fire on demonstrators have shocked everyone in South Africa, not least in my class. To them the scenes were reminiscent of the apartheid era that they had learned about from their parents and in history books at school. How could this kind of massacre really happen in a \"free\" South Africa?</p> <p>In the wake of the shootings, I asked five members of my class \u2013 Manez, Papi, Asanda, Sikhulule and Mpho \u2013 to sit down and have a real discussion about what they thought of the South Africa that the ANC had led and created after apartheid.</p> <p>What came out of the discussions was a feeling that political leaders were not delivering on the heady hopes of the post-apartheid era. They were disillusioned by the ANC and they couldn't trust the alternative. They were even starting to become disillusioned with Nelson Mandela. The \"born free\" generation wants a new deal for the new South Africa.</p> <h2>Voices of youth</h2> <p><strong>Asanda Kaka, 24 </strong></p> <p>You can argue about how Nelson Mandela sold our people out. A lot of people like him and a lot of people are in the process of starting to hate him because nothing has changed, you know. When I was young, when I heard his name, I wanted to cry, but now I'm older I want to know who benefited back then. He's known as a guy who liberated the people, which isn't true: there were a lot of other people involved. Our problems are bigger than Nelson Mandela and FW de Klerk [the last president of apartheid South Africa].</p> <p>Transformation and development is going at a very slow pace; better education could fast-forward the transition, but the government is not paying attention to education. It's such a mess. If they change the system it would create skills and jobs. I have voted for another party: I'm open about my vote and I voted for the Democratic Alliance because I felt like jumping from the frying pan and straight into the fire. I knew that when I voted for the DA there was no way they were going to win the election.</p> <p>There is so much hatred among people; some of that hatred is colour, nationality and all of that\u2026 and if you ask more people why they wouldn't vote for the DA, it's not because of the DA's policies. It's because they are white.</p> <p><strong>Papi Mirelli, 23 </strong></p> <p>Today's ANC has lost its vision. From the days of Nelson Mandela becoming president until now, I think they don't know their values any more. They don't know what their mission is any more. All that is backing them up is they have a lot of followers.</p> <p>Looking at the African National Congress Youth League, there's the feeling they speak with the same voice as we do, that they understand where we are coming from and where we want to go.</p> <p>But we don't want to see the country in the hands of white people again, so the ANC is the only way to go\u2026 we don't want to see that happening again. I don't see myself voting for anyone else.</p> <p>Growing up, you hear a lot of stories about how [people] thought and how they supported the ANC because it was their hope, it was their key out of the apartheid era.</p> <p>But I think, looking at it today, that [the ANC leaders] know that they are not delivering the promises they mentioned in the apartheid era. At their age they feel like they still need to clear up the future for us.</p> <p><strong>Mpho Seoposengwe, 23 </strong></p> <p>The Lonmin mine shootings were so reminiscent of the past. Rich people were being defended again and poor people were being attacked. How can you use live rounds on people? In general I feel that most of the time in this country the elite are the people benefiting.</p> <p>The ANC say they try to talk to the youth, and try and help us out, and they talk about job creation but I don't think they do that much. I don't think they speak in the language of the people; you know how investment bankers rob us all the time, it's the same thing. They will come through and campaign just before a vote. After they get what they need they are off; that is why we have riots all the time.</p> <p>Both of my parents were political. My father's interest has faded. I'm not very involved, but my mum was very strong in the political world, she was interested at a very young age. She was in the party for 20 years. My mum had an official position within government; she was very much part of it. My brother was born in prison because of her political activism and we had to be taken care of by relatives and neighbours. I was born in Soweto. She was even protesting while pregnant with me.</p> <p>Rome wasn't built overnight, I guess. There are a lot of young people who are trying to do their own thing, and have a more positive outlook on how they are choosing to run their lives. That is what I admire about the youth of today. But with everything else, it does seem to take a while. We are a very young democracy.</p> <p><strong>Sikhulule Ngxowa, 22 </strong></p> <p>Today's African National Congress is more like a brand. If anyone mentions ANC I just think of Adidas, like as a brand. The vision that Nelson Mandela had does not apply to what they have in mind today. There's a lot of corruption, with the ANC leaders.</p> <p>At the last election I didn't vote. Why should I? If you are looking for a job in the government you will have to know someone. That's ridiculous.</p> <p>You can have a masters, a PHD, but if you don't know someone inside the ANC you won't get a job. Only those who have seats in parliament or have high jobs in government are gaining, so why should I bother to vote?</p> <p>Housing is such a big problem. If you go back to locations such as Khayelitsha [a township on the Cape Flats], you will see people living in terrible conditions. The president - if we could take him there for a day - he wouldn't survive.</p> <p>Someone has to be held accountable. If you go to the government and ask why [the houses] haven't been built, the only answer you're going to get is that \"we are busy with that,\" or, \"the money has been allocated\".</p> <p><strong>Mawande Manez Sobetwa, 23 </strong></p> <p>The ANC are a very confusing party. They've got a massive membership, but there's a lot of violence, a lot of division. The biggest mistake they are making is they are not really focusing on governing the country. They are trying to keep competing with each other internally because of the promises they made to get elected into the structures within the ANC. They are paying back their dues more than they are governing the country.</p> <p>But what are the alternatives? The Democratic Alliance, led by Helen Zille, think that they can paint this picture of a black party led by a white face, and then we can all follow but it's not really working for me.</p> <p>I wish there could be an alternative because [the competition] would help the ANC. There needs to be an emergence of a leader, whether from the ANC or from another party, to inspire people.</p> <p>We need an Obama to believe that we can bring about change to the current situation.</p>",
  "<p>Ron Paul may not be speaking at the Republican convention but several thousands supporters gathered in Tampa on Saturday as part of a festival celebrating the libertarian-leaning Texan politician's career.</p> <p>With Paul stepping down from politics, and after repeated unsuccessful runs for the presidency, the event was part of a series of rallies aimed at galvanising his support base for a future without the retiring 12-term congressman.</p> <p>The Paul Fest was held at the Florida State Fairgrounds, a half hour away from downtown Tampa where in a few days Mitt Romney will be nominated as his party's candidate to battle President Barack Obama for the White House.</p> <p>But though Paul and Romney are \u2013 officially \u2013 in the same party, finding anyone with something positive to say about the former Massachusetts governor was difficult at Paul Fest.</p> <p>Certainly Lou Anderson, 56, a government worker from Oklahoma was not going to vote for Romney come the November election. He replied with a firm \"no\" when asked if he would support Romney. </p> <p>\"I don't know what to think of him. I don't trust him,\" he added.</p> <p>Mark Schmidter was the same. The fervent Ron Paul supporter from Orlando is a registered Republican and goes to his county GOP meeting every month. But he is not voting for Romney.</p> <p>\"No way. The party is bought and paid for by the corporations,\" said the 65-year-old roofer.</p> <p>Instead the crowds gathered at Paul Fest (the Paul stands for People Awakening and Uniting for Liberty) indulged themselves in the usual wide variety of causes that Paul himself has long espoused and mix both the extreme left and right.</p> <p>They range from wanting to legalise drugs and bring American troops home from abroad to scrapping the welfare state, slashing the government budget and getting rid of the Federal Reserve.</p> <p>In a hall full of stands and stalls there was a hugely disparate group of people hawking different wares and causes. There was one stand of Oath Keepers \u2013 an organisation of police and soldiers who believe the government might one day turn on the American people \u2013 and two stalls devoted to ending America's foreign wars.</p> <p>One company had set up shop to sell the idea of investing in gold and silver, reflecting Paul's belief in returning the dollar to the gold standard rather than setting its value against other currencies. Another stand flogged t-shirts bearing the phrase \"Who is John Galt?\" which is a reference to a novel by libertarian philosopher Ayn Rand. Yet another group sold Ron Paul chocolate bars under the slogan: \"Liberty Just Got Sweeter.\"</p> <p>The three-day event featured a lengthy roster of bands, singers and speakers.</p> <p>Paul himself is not set to appear, though he will be giving a major speech at a different Tampa rally on Sunday afternoon. That moment will mark the likely end of Paul's career on the national stage in American politics.</p> <p>He is stepping down and his campaign's efforts to crash Romney's Tampa coronation by amassing delegates using arcane party rules has largely been thwarted by Republican leaders and lawyers.</p> <p>In lieu of an appearance by the man himself, the crowd at Paul Fest was treated to an appearance by Paul's brother, Wayne Paul.</p> <p>The younger Paul sibling won cheers with a call to the classic Paul themes of cutting government spending and ending the taking on of debt.</p> <p>\"We have started a revolution and we are going to finish it. It is about freedom and loving liberty. That is why we are here today,\" he said underneath a banner that read: \"Thank you, Dr Paul.\"</p> <p>The Paul movement without Paul might face an uncertain future, but it can point to numerous triumphs.</p> <p>Largely dismissed as a crank in 2008, Paul's 2012 run was a different affair, attracting larger support and media attention.</p> <p>It was also bolstered by the emergence of the Tea Party, which embraced many of Paul's small government ideals. Now some of his beliefs, like auditing the Federal Reserve and going back to the gold standard, are becoming increasingly embraced by Republicans.</p> <p>The movement also benefits from a large number of young and enthusiastic activists.</p> <p>Though the ageing Paul often comes across as a gleefully cantankerous old man, the acts on the stage ranged from rock to rappers to country and the crowd was predominately young.</p> <p>The gathering was also set to provide a venue for a bit of Hollywood glamour in the shape of a speech on Sunday by Harmon Kaslow, who is the producer of Atlas Shrugged: Part Two.</p> <p>The movie is the second part of a dramatisation of Rand's most famous work and will be coming out later this year.</p> <p>Kaslow, who converted to Rand's beliefs after signing on to make the film, will show clips to the Paul Fest crowd. \"It changed my life. It has been an incredible experience,\" he told The Guardian in an interview.</p>",
  "<p>President Barack Obama has laid into his would-be White House replacement in a fervent attack on Mitt Romney's policies and character designed to knock his challenger off course ahead of a crucial convention speech.</p> <p>In a calculated move timed just days before Republican delegates meet in Florida to nod through Romney as their presidential candidate, Obama accused his rival of holding \"extreme positions\" and failing to \"own up\" to responsibilities.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/25/obama-romney-extreme-positions-elections\">an interview with the Associated Press</a>, the president said that contrary to common belief, he had no beef with the former Massachusetts governor on a personal level, adding: \"I don't really know him well.\"</p> <p>But he attacked Romney on positions the candidate has taken that tie him to the right wing of his party, and cast aspersion over whether the Republican presidential hope had adopted stances out of conviction or through political expediency.</p> <p>In the interview conducted Thursday but released on Saturday, Obama said: \"I can't speak to governor Romney's motivations,\" adding: \"What I can say is that he has signed up for positions, extreme positions, that are very consistent with positions that a number of House Republicans have taken.</p> <p>\"And whether he actually believes in those or not, I have no doubt that he would carry forward some of the things that he's talked about.\"</p> <p>The president cited Romney's insistence on tax relief for America' super-rich as evidence of his \"extreme\" positions.</p> <p>He also sought to tie the Republican presidential challenger to the recent furore surrounding conservative a Senate candidate, Missouri's Todd Akin.</p> <p>Akin has been roundly condemned for comments he made suggesting that \"legitimate rape\" rarely leads to pregnancy.</p> <p>Romney himself has described the remarks as \"inexcusable\" and led party calls for him to step down as a Senate candidate. And he is on record as not opposing abortion in cases of rape and incest or if it will save the mother's life.</p> <p>But Obama noted in the Associated Press interview that calls for a \"no exceptions rule\" in regards to a ban on abortion \u2013 the position Akin was ham-fistedly trying to defend \u2013 are part of the Republican platform in Tampa</p> <p>The White House incumbent also predicted that a President Romney would not \"stand in the way\" if Congress gave him a bill that stripped away women's control over their reproductive health.</p> <p>The comments reflect a belief in Democratic circles that conservative positions adopted by Republicans on social issues could alienate the party from moderate and independent voters.</p> <p>The president also aimed a blow at Romney's personal tax arrangements \u2013 another common area of attack in recent months.</p> <p>Romney refusal to release more tax returns for public inspection displayed a \"lack of willingness to take responsibility for what this job entails\".</p> <p>As to his own record, Obama agreed that in regards to the economy, America was not \"where we need to be\".</p> <p>But he added: \"Governor Romney's policies would make things worse for middle-class families and offer no prospect for long-term opportunity for those striving to get into the middle class.\"</p> <p>The timing of the interview \u2013 just 10 weeks out from the general election and days before the Republican convention is due to begin \u2013 is clearly designed to steal a march on Romney ahead of his big week in Florida.</p> <p>A GfK poll released on Saturday suggest that the White House race is still on a knife-edge, with 47% of respondent saying they plan to back Obama and 46% opting for Romney.</p> <p>But despite the even split in voter intention, most people still expect Obama to win. The GfK survey found that 58% believe the Democrat will remain in power, with just 32% saying they thought the White House keys would exchange hands in November.</p> <p>In the Associated Press interview, Obama expressed confidence that voters would stick with him in the general election.</p> <p>\"If they saw governor Romney offering serious proposals that offered some sort of concrete ways in which middle-class families would be helped, then I could understand them thinking about that choice,\" Obama said.</p> <p>\"But that's not what's happening,\" he added.</p>",

I saw how important things like Medicare and Social Security were in their lives,\" he said Saturday.</p> <p>Meanwhile in Ohio on Saturday, Romney and Ryan campaigned together in what is expected to be the last set-piece event ahead of next week's Republican convention in Tampa.</p> <p>In a speech that leaned heavily on Obama's record on the economy, Romney received an enthusiastic \"no\" from the crowd on asking if they wanted \"four more years\" of the president.</p> <p>But in an indication that they might find the running on healthcare trickier, both Romney and Ryan were heckled by protesters over their plans for Medicare as they made their way to the rally.</p>",
  "<p>Some of them believe Barack Obama was born in Kenya. Others want to force raped women who become pregnant to have their child. There are those who vilify Obama as a socialist and want to do away with most of the federal government. A fair few doubt the theory of evolution or hold that gays can be \"cured\".</p> <p>As Mitt Romney arrives at the <a href=\"http://www.gopconvention2012.com/\" title=\"\">Republican national convention </a>in Tampa, Florida, where he will be nominated to run for president, he faces the difficult task of dealing with a party base that has become one of the most radical in recent American history.</p> <p>Convulsed by the rise of the anti-government Tea Party and dominated by socially conservative Christians, the Republican party has continued to move right in recent years. That means the carefully laid plans for a Tampa convention aimed at introducing a voter-friendly version of Romney could easily be upset by the party's more extreme elements.</p> <p>\"They don't want anyone to look behind the curtain,\" said Professor Shaun Bowler, a political scientist at the University of California, Riverside. \"You want the party base to turn up, give money and keep quiet. But it is hard to keep them quiet.\" However, the curtain has already been lifted to some degree.</p> <p>The week leading up to the convention was supposed to see a media rollout of Romney as a president-in-waiting. Instead it was dominated by an ugly row centred on a Republican Missouri Senate candidate,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/20/akin-under-pressure-to-quit\" title=\"\"> congressman Todd Akin</a>, who used the phrase \"legitimate rape\" while talking about denying abortions to pregnant rape victims.</p> <p>Romney called on him to leave the race and the Republican national committee chairman, Reince Priebus, asked him not to come to Tampa. But in a sign of how little control the party's elite has over its base, Akin refused to step down and last week was spotted in Tampa meeting social conservative groups. At the same time it was revealed that Akin supporters had coughed up $100,000 for his campaign funds in two days.</p> <p>But party bigwigs should perhaps not be surprised. Though Akin's language was shocking, his views are <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/79945.html\" title=\"\">not too different from the party's official policy platform</a> \u2013 in defiance of Romney. Indeed that extreme position on abortion is one historically shared by Paul Ryan, the outspoken Wisconsin conservative picked by Romney as his running mate.</p> <p>There is a real consequence to such disputes over contentious social issues. Romney's support among women, perhaps influenced by recent spats over abortion and reproductive rights, has plummeted. A survey last week showed Romney lagging by 13% with women voters in six key battleground states. Obama was beating Romney by 52% to 39% and about half of women voters said they were less likely to vote for Romney since he chose Ryan.</p> <p>Nor is it just this issue that is likely to hamper Romney as he tries to pull off the complicated double act of using the Tampa convention to appeal to America's middle ground, while also appeasing a conservative base that doesn't trust him.</p> <p>Gay marriage is guaranteed to fire up the base and Tampa will see some vocal opponents making a great deal of noise. Michele Bachmann, a Minnesota congresswoman and former Romney presidential rival, will be speaking at numerous events. They include a \"Unity Rally 2012\" that is going to be held at a church tomorrow night. Bachmann has spoken out vociferously on gay rights, once referring to homosexuality as \"part of Satan\".</p> <p>Appearing alongside Bachmann will be former pizza magnate Herman Cain, another former rival to Romney, who caused eyebrows to be raised when he briefly became the frontrunner in the bitter party nomination race, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/ana-marie-cox-blog/2011/dec/05/herman-cain-loss-newt-gingrich-gain\" title=\"\">only to drop out</a> over sexual harassment allegations. But he remains popular with many in the Tea Party, who admire his impassioned support for slashing government spending and instituting a controversial flat tax plan.</p> <p>Other Tea Party darlings will include <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-moore/ted-cruz-david-dewhurst_b_1723099.html\" title=\"\">Ted Cruz</a>, a Senate candidate in Texas who is being touted as a future party leader and has been given a high-profile speaking slot at the convention. Yet Cruz holds beliefs far outside the mainstream. He has warned that Islamic sharia law is an \"enormous problem\" in America, says elected officials should not march in gay pride parades and believes the UN is secretly trying to undermine America's economy and sovereignty.</p> <p>And then there is another Tea Party favourite who has been given a prominent role in Tampa: real estate mogul and reality TV star Donald Trump.</p> <p>Trump has told his fans to prepare for a surprise at Tampa, which is likely to be a video in which he sacks an Obama impersonator and deploys his famous \"You're fired!\" catchphrase. But having Trump so visible is a political risk. He is one of the leading proponents <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/06/donald-trump-birther-obama-birth-certificate_n_1749257.html\" title=\"\">of the \"Birther\" movement,</a> which questions whether Obama was born in America. His presence is hardly designed to show an air of moderation or seriousness.</p> <p>A final thorn in Romney's side could be Texan congressman Ron Paul. Libertarian-leaning Paul is bowing out of national politics, but his followers are going to be vocal in Tampa, highlighting their beliefs in minimal government, an anti-war foreign policy and getting rid of the Federal Reserve. Though Paul won no individual states while he was running against Romney, his campaign later tried to exploit arcane party rules to send as many Paul-supporting delegates to the convention as possible. Fights over that \"stealth strategy\" have ended up in the courts and, in Louisiana, resulted in arrests and physical injuries.</p> <p>Now thousands of Paul supporters are holding a three-day festival in Tampa in his honour. Paul himself will speak tomorrow night at a rally at the University of South Florida's Sun Dome. Coverage is hardly likely to leave the impression that Romney heads a united or a moderate party.</p> <p>One thing that could dampen things is Hurricane Isaac, which is barrelling towards Florida and may yet force some of the convention to be delayed or cancelled. \"For Romney, that is probably a blessing in disguise,\" said Bowler.</p>",
  "<p>Questions have been raised over the New York police department's handling of a shooting near the Empire State Building after armed officers injured nine passers-by as they pursued a gunman who had just shot dead his former boss.</p> <p>One of those injured by police told the Guardian that officers appeared to fire \"randomly\" as they confronted Jeffrey Johnson, 58, minutes after a workplace dispute escalated into a chaotic shootout in one of the busiest parts of Manhattan.</p> <p>Reports suggest that while Johnson drew his gun when he was confronted by officers, he did not fire; all those injured appear to have been shot by police. The New York police commissioner, Raymond Kelly, said officers had no choice but to act as they did: police discharged 14 rounds and the gunman died at the scene.</p> <p>The incident began just after 9am on Friday when Johnson, described as a \"disgruntled former employee\", walked up to Steve Ercolino, 41, his former manager at Hazan Imports, a business that operates from premises in Midtown, near the Empire State Building. Johnson shot him three times before calmly walking away.</p> <p>A construction worker alterted two police officers stationed at the landmark. They appear to have attempted to stop Johnson, who dropped a bag and pulled out his gun, according to witnesses. In the ensuing shootout, Johnson died.</p> <p>Panic soon ensued in the tourist-heavy streets around the Empire State Building, with fears that another mass shooting was under way. However, it became clear that it was not a random attack when police revealed the victim was targeted. Johnson had previously been fired from the business.</p> <p>Robert Asika was among those wounded, shot in the elbow from a distance of around eight feet by one of the two police officers who confronted Johnson. He accused police of \"shooting randomly\", and said he saw at least two others hit by police bullets.</p> <p>\"If you're gonna aim try and aim perfectly. If you wanna aim at the target, you got to know what you're doing because it's the street,\" Asika said. \"I could have been dead right now. I could have been dead.\"</p> <p>Asika was working on 5th Avenue on Friday morning, selling tickets for tour buses and the building's observation deck. He had only been in the job a week, after having been unemployed for over a year. \"I was just standing there and I saw people running. I didn't want to run because I wanted to know why people were running so I turned around and I saw this guy,\" he said.</p> <p>\"He was suited up, he had like a tie and a briefcase. If you see him, you'd probably think he was like a doctor, or maybe a lawyer, a business guy. He just looked like a normal guy.\"</p> <p>Johnson, who was wearing a light-coloured suit, had just killed his former boss and was walking calmly away. \"Jeffrey just came from behind two cars, pulled out his gun, put it up to Steve's head and shot him,\" said Carol Timan, whose daughter, Irene, was walking to Hazan Imports at the time with Ercolino. A construction worker saw the shooting and told two police officers who were stationed outside the Empire State Building. </p> <p>The mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg \u2013 a vocal critic of America's lax firearm controls \u2013 said: \"Once again, there are an awful lot of guns out there.\" He added that although homicides in New York were on the decline, \"we are not immune to the problem of gun violence\".</p> <p>Police said Johnson been employed for six years as a designer of women's accessories at Hazan Imports. Kelly said during a press conference that he was laid off as part of a downsizing at the firm. Kelly described the gunman as a \"disgruntled former employee\" who came back to confront his former manager. \"He shot and killed the former co-worker, striking him three times,\" Kelly said.</p> <p>Johnson moved to draw his weapon, a .45 caliber handgun, as the officers approached, police said. There are conflicting reports as to what happened next. \"The [police] tape clearly shows that the gunman had the gun out, and was trying to kill the officers,\" Bloomberg said. Other officials at the scene reportedly said the man had not fired on police.</p> <p>The two police officers discharged 14 rounds, killing Johnson outside the entrance to the Empire State Building. Kelly at first said Johnson fired on officers, but police later said they were trying to determine whether Johnson fired. \"These officers ... had absolutely no choice,\" Kelly said. \"This individual took a gun out very close to them and perhaps fired at them.\"</p> <p>Johnson legally bought the gun in Sarasota, Florida, in 1991, but he did not have a required permit to possess the weapon in New York City, police said.</p> <p>Four women and five men were taken to city hospitals with gunshot wounds, but none was believed to be in a life-threatening condition. Police shut down nearby streets as forensic teams checked the gunman's body. The FBI were quick to confirm that the attack was not an act of terrorism.</p> <p>Askia described the scene when officers caught up with Johnson. He said the gunman stopped six feet away from him, with two officers about eight feet in the other direction. \"All of a sudden the guy stopped, and he was facing a cop who was following him,\" Asika said.</p> <p>\"He just reached in his suit and took out the gun, and I saw him pull it [towards] the cops. I'm like, is this guy for real? One of the cops was trying to shoot back at him and one of them shot me while the other one shot the guy.\"</p> <p>\"As soon as the bullet hit me, I felt like I didn't feel it. But then as soon as I tried to get up, I couldn't get up. I looked there and the blood was gushing out,\" Asika said.</p> <p>\"I was crawling, trying to get across the street, to the safe side of the street. I got across the street and I just fell at the bus stop and I was laying there and I couldn't get up no more. I was so tired, I was so scared. I've never been scared like that in my whole life.\"</p> <p>Asika said Bloomberg visited him in hospital, but he received no apology from police. He was discharged with his arm bandaged and in a sling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F57410489&amp;show_artwork=true\"> <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F57410489&show_artwork=true\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Erica Solar, a mother of two who works as a receptionist on 37th Street, was hit in the back of the leg as she made her way to Dunkin' Donuts. Solar's friend, Christopher Collins, found her lying on the street as he got off a bus on his way to work.</p> <p>\"She was basically in shock. She didn't know if she had gotten stabbed or if she had gotten shot, but she just knew she was bleeding, and I was just there trying to keep her calm until paramedics arrived,\" Collins told the Guardian.</p> <p>\"It was chaotic. Everybody was running, cops were there immediately,\" Collins said. Solar was taken to Bellevue hospital, about a mile from the Empire State Building.</p> <p>Another among the wounded was Media Rosario, from Brooklyn, who like Solar was hit in the back of the leg. She said that everything happened so fast, she saw people running, and when she turned around to see what happened, she was already shot,\" said her sister-in-law, Auselis Rosario.</p> <p>Johnson lived alone in the Upper East Side, his superintendent, Guillermo Suarez confirmed to the Associated Press. Suarez described Johnson as a \"very likeable guy\" who always wore a suit. \"He was always alone,\" said Gisela Casella, who lived a few floors above him. \"I always felt bad. I said 'Doesn't he have a girlfriend?' I never saw him with anybody.\"</p> <p>City officials were quick to praise the response by police and the construction worker who followed Johnson from the site of the initial shooting.</p> <p>Bloomberg said: \"We all use the word 'hero' \u2013 he did what he should have done.\" The mayor added: \"He saw something, he said something\" \u2013 the phrase has become the backbone of efforts to get New York residents to be vigilant ever since the September 11 attacks. The actions of both the worker and police officers may have prevented further injuries, Bloomberg and Kelly said.</p> <p>The incident puts gun crime in America back in the spotlight. As with other high-profile summer shootings in the US \u2013 at a movie theatre in Colorado on 20 July and at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin earlier this month \u2013 it is thought unlikely that Barack Obama or Mitt Romney will address the issue in an election year.</p>"
