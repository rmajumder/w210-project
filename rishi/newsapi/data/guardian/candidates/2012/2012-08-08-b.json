  "<p>We all make silly statements. We all make poor predictions. Indeed most Washington pundits are <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/03/study-pundits-wrong-most-_n_856886.html\">right as often as they are wrong</a>. One Washington prognosticator, however, stands above the rest.</p> <p>Step up, Dick Morris.</p> <p>Morris was at one time a top political operative. From his guiding of now Congressman Jerry Nadler's student government campaign to his work for Bill Clinton, Morris was a winner. He was running another Bill Clinton campaign, in 1996, when he found himself <a href=\"http://img.timeinc.net/time/magazine/archive/covers/1996/1101960909_400.jpg\">embroiled in a sex scandal</a>. </p> <p>That imbroglio marked a turning point. Morris was no longer to work for Clinton. Instead, he reinvented himself as a writer and television pundit. It is this work that we celebrate here today.</p> <p>Morris' ability to make statements and predictions that are <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/research/2010/11/09/dick-morris-needs-a-new-crystal-ball/173089\">often so, so wrong</a> is exceptional. He has <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mark-nickolas/worst-pundit-in-america-d_b_160212.html\">been called</a> the \"worst pundit in America\". The more cynical among us might argue that the word \"America\" should be replaced with \"world\". Indeed, to recall all of Morris's spectacular failures would require more space than Santa is allotted for his Christmas list. </p> <p>Instead, I bring you ten fun and exciting Dick Morris audios, images, videos (in chronological order). Most of these are forecasts, hilarious for just how wrong they were. I cannot guarantee them as the top ten of all time: there are just too many Dick Morris moments from which to choose, so please feel free to note any choices that I've omitted in the discussion thread. </p> <p><strong>1. Bush and congressional Democrats in 2002</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394453697\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/8/1344462942974/dickmorriscspan1_460x276.jpg\" alt=\"Dick Morris on C-Span\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dick Morris on C-Span (<a href=\"http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/Plays/start/4646/stop/4826\">view video here</a>)</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sometimes, Morris is kind enough to offer us a two-for-one deal. In the span of two minutes, Morris said that President Bush's approval rating would remain in the 80s so long as we were fighting overseas. It did, of course, <a href=\"http://www.hist.umn.edu/~ruggles/Approval.htm\">drop precipitously</a>, into the low 50s, by the 2004 election. Morris also believed that congressional Democrats had neutralized Bush by supporting his wars. It turned out the opposite happened: 2002 was only the second time since 1934 that the president's party gained seats in the House during a midterm election. </p> <p><strong>2. North Korea and Iran will cave</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394453698\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/8/1344463003976/dickmorriscspan2_460x276.jpg\" alt=\"Dick Morris on C-Span\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dick Morris on C-Span (<a href=\"http://www.c-spanvideo.org/clip/3662917\">view video here</a>)</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I guess Morris thought that if he couldn't predict elections, then he might do better with the actions of foreign governments. Apparently, Bush's foreign policy was going to bring Iran and North Korea to their knees and force them to cooperate with the United States. Eight years later, Iran continues to back the Syrian government and is as close to war with Israel as it's ever been. Oh, and North Korea is as much a mystery and a headache as ever.</p> <p><strong>3. Condi v Hillary</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394453699\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/8/1344463109631/dickmorrisbookcover_220.jpg\" alt=\"Dick Morris book cover\" width=\"220\" height=\"329\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dick Morris's 2005 book, Condi Vs. Hillary, predicting the 2008 presidential contest, wrongly</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This book cover says it all.</p> <p>Morris was correct in believing that Clinton would run, but wrong that she would get the nomination. </p> <p>But Condoleezza Rice running for political office? </p> <p>She'd never run for anything, and didn't run in 2008. </p> <p>Plus, how in the dickens would she possibly win a primary in a pro-life party when she is pro-choice? </p> <p>Morris's wrongness truly boggles the mind.</p> <p><strong>4. The 2008 electoral map</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394453700\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/8/1344463322458/dickmorrismap_460.jpg\" alt=\"Dick Morris election map\" width=\"460\" height=\"293\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>What do Arkansas, Louisiana, Tennessee, and West Virginia have in common? They are all states where the <a href=\"http://www.pollster.com/polls/2008president/\">Pollster.com aggregate</a> favored John McCain over Barack Obama by at least 10 points, yet Morris, for some ridiculous reason, thought the states were toss-ups or leaned Obama? Obama lost them all by 12 to 20 points. And for good measure, Obama won the leaning-McCain state of Indiana.</p> <p><strong>5. Sarah Palin wins 2008 vice-presidential debate</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Mv9pt6LBqwg?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Mv9pt6LBqwg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Well, Morris thinks Sarah Palin is Ronald Reagan, or something. Morris also manages to smack around Hillary Clinton in this video. To his point that Palin won the debate? All <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/uselection2008/presidentialdebates/3129259/Who-won-the-VP-debate-Palin-or-Joe-Biden.html\">national polls</a> found voters believing Biden won the debate, by at least 15 points. Some <a href=\"http://www.surveyusa.com/index.php/2008/10/03/ohio-poll-palin-biden-debate-is-split-decision/\">state</a> <a href=\"http://www.surveyusa.com/index.php/2008/10/03/state-of-washington-poll-split-decision-on-palin-biden-vice-presidential-debate/\">data</a> pointed to a closer race, but even there, voters thought Biden was more prepared to be president. Palin resigned from office less than a year later and seemingly has no future in running for political office.</p> <p><strong>6. Democrats to lose over 80 seats in the 2010 midterm elections</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jgImACKB-hY?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jgImACKB-hY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>There's a difference between being overly optimistic and being downright off the ledge. Morris crosses that line many times, and did so in calling for Republicans to win 80 new seats in the House of Representatives. Republicans would win a historic victory in 2010, but would only take 63 seats.</p> <p><strong>7. Republicans will shutdown the government over something in 2011 ... and win!</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C_-t7lGR8tI?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C_-t7lGR8tI\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Sometimes, I'm not even sure from where a Dick Morris prediction comes. Here, he claimed that Republicans would shut down the government after regaining control of the House in the 2010 elections, and would win that shutdown. No shutdown ever happened. I guess one almost did over the debt ceiling, but Republicans were the ones who caved to President Obama. </p> <p><strong>8. Donald Trump to run for president</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://mediamatters.org/embed/181690\"> <iframe class=\"video-embed\" src=\"https://mediamatters.org/embed/181690\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Donald Trump running for office is like a game of three-card monty. Anyone who knows anything knows that Trump likes to fool around, but at the end of the day, is never going to run. He just likes to hear himself talk. Somehow, Morris thought that Trump had great potential. Trump would plummet in the polls \u2026 and, of course, didn't run.</p> <p><strong>9. Obama to secretly take our guns away on 27 July</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XZeJpXLsVCI?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XZeJpXLsVCI\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Did you know that President Obama was working in cahoots with the United Nations to take Americans' guns away on 27 July 2012? I didn't either. It was Obama's secret plan to foil the second amendment! Of course, the United States delegation to the UN <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/27/un-arms-trade-treaty-nra_n_1711578.html\">ensured the bill failed</a>.</p> <p><strong>10. The \"real polls\"</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jabmky1BT38?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jabmky1BT38\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>I'm just not even sure I have the words for this one, but Morris claims he has the \"real polls\" from a pollster he can't name. Perhaps the funniest thing of this whole clips is even the \"real polls\" have Romney winning only 228 electoral votes. He needs 270 to win the election. (My own estimate would be that if the election were today, then Romney would take 206 electoral votes.)</p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <p>The guy behind the counter at Subway is as likely to be accurate at predicting political outcomes as Dick Morris. Dick Morris, however, is far more entertaining.</p>",
  "<p>It's the Middle Class, Stupid!, the <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/07/09/james-carville-on-his-new-book-it-s-the-middle-class-stupid.html\" title=\"\">new zeitgeist book</a> by grizzled Clinton-era advisers Stan Greenberg and James \"Ragin' Cajun\" Carville isn't your standard fare by former political insiders. It's less a retrospective and more an argument about reversing the declining fortunes of middle America: not only should this be the defining issue of this year's presidential election but the struggle of a generation. Their unsparing opening line \u2013 \"We failed and that isn't good enough\" \u2013 serves as a stark warning to the political elite on both sides of the Atlantic that more of the same thinking won't revitalise the prospects of a faltering middle class.</p> <p>Their theme chimes with Barack Obama's impassioned plea to the middle class that he is their best hope for greater economic security today as well as shared prosperity tomorrow \u2013 a pitch that will be remorselessly repeated in every stump speech, will dominate September's Democratic convention and will be rammed home in October's presidential debates.</p> <p>Leave to one side the virtual airbrushing of the \"working class\" from American political discourse and accept the assumption that middle America is where this election is going to be won and lost. It's a view that underpins the edginess of the race. Despite his <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/us/general_election_romney_vs_obama-1171.html\" title=\"\">narrow overall lead</a>, polling shows Obama trails Mitt Romney among that sought-after group: households with an income of $35k to $90k.</p> <p>If the Obama message is clear, the policy to back it up remains less so. Given the chosen election strategy you might have expected a detailed middle-class economic manifesto to have emerged. Which is not to make light of the relative success of the administration's post-crisis economic management and focus on jobs. Nor is it to indulge the fantasy that there aren't stark differences between the candidates: Romney's Dubya-esque tax plans would give the rich jaw-dropping tax cuts (while increasing the burden on the vast majority of taxpayers); Obama favours a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/10/obama-millionaire-tax-breaks-romney\" title=\"\">tax rise for \"millionaires and billionaires\"</a>.</p> <p>Yet there is a growing sense that more needs to be on offer from the president than a commitment to avoid the wilder lurches of his opponent. As Jared Bernstein, who formerly led the <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/strongmiddleclass/about\" title=\"\">White House's middle class taskforce</a>, says: \"Middle-class economic security is the right agenda but what's needed now is a plain-spoken policy debate so these voters can hear not just that their vote is being courted, but that there is a plan in place to reconnect economic growth and middle class prosperity.\"</p> <p>Bernstein could just as easily have been talking about Britain, where the highly precarious economic position of a large chunk of the working population already hangs heavily over the next election. Typical wages have been flat or falling for nearly a decade. Home ownership has moved out of the reach of a fast-growing swath of the working population, and rents are climbing fast. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17155411\" title=\"\">Fewer than half of employees are in an employer's pension scheme</a>, a figure that drops to a third in the private sector. A worryingly high proportion of households are so drenched in debt they risk going underwater when interest rates eventually return to normal levels.</p> <p>Of course, some things get lost in translation in any comparison with the US. There, the middle class has always had a hazier and more inclusive feel, lacking the social affectations and exclusivity that the term is freighted with in the UK. (Consequently British political leaders continually strain to find the right language, whether it be \"hard-working families\", \"the squeezed middle\", \"strivers\" and \u2013 remember this one? \u2013 \"<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12149705\" title=\"\">alarm clock Britain</a>\".) Nor have low- and middle-income households \u2013 let's sidestep the \"class\" word \u2013 experienced the severity of wage squeeze, or the recent collapse in house prices, that has afflicted their US counterparts. And, mercifully, the NHS removes one of the most brutal sources of American insecurity as well as alleviating the downward pressure on wages that employer-based healthcare generates.</p> <p>For all these differences there will nonetheless be intense pressure here, as in the US, for a pragmatic and plausible plan for higher living standards. The risk is that limited resources \u2013 and imaginations \u2013 result in some of the favoured myths of contemporary politics being recycled as answers.</p> <p>Let's hope not. A \"modern industrial policy\" may well be vital for a more balanced and export-oriented economy, but it will never result in significant rises in manufacturing employment or lead us to steady wage growth in our service-dominated economy. First-time buyer schemes will bring cheer to the lucky few who benefit, but aren't any sort of replacement for the massive housebuilding programme so desperately needed. And, yes, there's a role for efficiency drives in government, but please let's not pretend they will reduce the need for tax rises or spending cuts.</p> <p>It's hardly a surprise that the rhetoric of a presidential campaign \u2013 even in world-weary 2012 \u2013 soars above hum-drum policy. And make no mistake, if Obama succeeds in defying the plight of other post-crisis incumbents by winning in November, it will be a historic feat. But the cold reality is that the middle-class families he talks about so passionately have been going backwards. Should he secure a second term, it will take Rooseveltian policy ambition to re-wire US capitalism so that the middle class rises along with GDP.</p> <p>As with the Clinton-Blair era, elements of whatever agenda emerges will find an echo here. For better or worse the fate of the US middle class is likely to reveal something about what is in store for Britain.</p>",
  "<p>\"It's a common thing,\" says Balvinder Kaur Saund, a Labour councillor for the London Borough of Redbridge and chair of the Sikh Women's Alliance, \"to walk through an estate in [some parts of east London] and young boys throw stones and shout 'Taliban' at you. I have seen that myself.\" She was once with a man \u2013 a Sikh who wore a turban \u2013 when some youths shouted \"Osama\" at him. \"I wanted to retaliate but he said 'Just ignore it and carry on walking'.\" She thinks many more incidents go&#xa0;unreported.</p> <p>The terrible events in Wisconsin at the weekend, where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/06/sikh-temple-shooting-wisconsin-police\" title=\"\">a gunman</a> shot dead six people at a gurdwara, is an extreme, and thankfully rare, attack, but there are numerous instances of Sikhs being targeted in the US and the UK. The first victim of a backlash against Muslims in America after 9/11 was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/17/us/sikh-owner-of-gas-station-is-fatally-shot-in-rampage.html\" title=\"\">Balbir Singh Sodhi</a>, a Sikh who was shot dead. There have been other physical attacks on people, and on gurdwaras. In March this year in the US, a letter was sent to a Sikh family \u2013 addressed to the \"Turban Family\" \u2013 claiming to know they had links to the Taliban. Mitt Romney, potentially the next president of the US, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/08/romney-slips-refers-to-shooting-site-as-sheik-temple/\" title=\"\">twice referred to Sikhs as \"sheikhs\"</a> in expressing his condolences over the temple shooting.</p> <p>After the London bombings in 2005, a gurdwara in Kent was firebombed, and another in Leeds. After 9/11, former Metropolitan police officer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/jan/09/race.world1\" title=\"\">Gurpal Virdi</a> remembers: \"I dealt with a lot of complaints \u2013 we had attacks on individuals, even on women. When it happened, I was going around stations to tell the officers the differences between the Taliban and a Sikh because they didn't know either. And this is London, a multicultural area. It doesn't help when they kept showing images of [Osama Bin Laden] and in the UK, it's&#xa0;the Sikhs who wear a&#xa0;turban.\"</p> <p>And then there are the everyday occurrences witnessed by Balvinder Kaur Saund, where Sikh men in particular are eyed suspiciously, as if they are proud members of al-Qaida.</p> <p>Varinder Singh, co-founder of the <a href=\"http://www.turbancampaign.com/updates/\" title=\"\">Turban Campaign</a>, which tries to counter negative reporting of the Sikh community, says: \"Racism has always existed, but certainly September 11 didn't help. It created a suspicion of the Sikh community, particularly because of the appearance of the male members. Inevitably that leads to physical and verbal attacks, but I think the recent attacks in America are a step beyond that. That was deliberate and I think the argument of mistaken identity can't really be used here \u2013 there were big signs outside saying 'Sikh temple'. I think a general hatred has developed. Islamophobia is rife and applies to everyone of colour, regardless of religious background. In the eyes of people who wish to hate or belong to fascist organisations you are the enemy and seen as a potential target. In this country, there is a lot of emphasis placed on extremism in certain corners of the Muslim community, however the government and councils tend to overlook far-right organisations such as the English Defence League.\"</p> <p>In May, the EDL tried to ally itself with the Sikh community by hijiacking a Sikh protest in Luton outside a police station after allegations that a Sikh woman had been raped by a Muslim man. \"When we see groups such as the EDL try to align themselves with the Sikh community, it's a relationship that can't last,\" says Varinder Singh. \"This is a move to isolate the Muslim community who need our support.\"</p> <p>Is there a danger that in trying to differentiate themselves from Muslims \u2013 and there have been historical tensions between some Sikhs and Muslims \u2013 Sikhs are themselves contributing to Islamophobia? \"It does happen and it is dangerous,\" says Sabby Dhalu, joint secretary of Unite Against Fascism. \"When I put the argument to people, a lot of them agree with me in opposing Islamophobia and the need to work with Muslims. It's all the more reason for the decent majority to speak out.\"</p>",

  "<p>The heavy truck lay upside down like a broken toy. Beside it, a white Toyota was barely recognisable as a car \u2013 its front was crushed and the rest was a tangle of metal and wire after a head-on collision on one of Kenya's busiest highways. The bodies of the six people who died in the collision had been removed. Little remained of their lives \u2013 a packet of sugar in a shopping bag, a red shoe by the back seat.</p> <p>The accident took place last month near Machakos on the Nairobi-Mombasa highway. The day before, five people had died near the western town of Kericho when a tyre burst and their car rolled. A bad start to July, but nothing too unusual in east Africa's largest economy.</p> <p>In Machakos, police chief Richard Kerich urged drivers to be careful. News reports said the Toyota had been overtaking and was on the wrong side of the road when it slammed into the truck. \"[Drivers] should observe all the traffic rules when they are driving, and avoid speeding and driving carelessly,\" Kerich said.</p> <p>The problem, in a country with a growing middle class and ambitious plans to build more highways, is that many drivers don't. Now, tough new laws being examined by parliament could give motorists a greater incentive to drive carefully.</p> <p>Jakoyo Midiwo, an MP from western Kenya, has tabled a private member's bill to amend the traffic act and crack down on dangerous driving. The <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CE4QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kenyalaw.org%2Fklr%2Ffileadmin%2Fpdfdownloads%2Fbills%2F2012%2FTrafficAmendmentBill2012.doc&amp;ei=01z8T5nCLIS-8AOc6v2-Bw&amp;usg=AFQjCNG0l3vlPlByUlaCF-yAYi9OPWD_Fw\" title=\"\">traffic (amendment) bill 2012</a> (doc) proposes life sentences for motorists who cause death by dangerous driving. It also calls for a jail term of up to 10 years, or a fine of up to 1m shillings (\u00a37,600), or both, for anyone found drink-driving.</p> <p>Drivers found speeding could be jailed for three months, pay a 20,000 shilling fine, or both. Drivers who overlap on pavements, or go through petrol stations to avoid traffic jams, could face three months in jail, a fine of 30,000 shillings, or both. The bill has been debated in parliament, but Midiwo says he is talking to the transport ministry about the possibility of merging the provisions of a similar bill recently approved by the coalition government.</p> <p>There is some debate about Midiwo's proposals, particularly his idea to do away with the police traffic department and train all officers to handle accidents.</p> <p>Elijah Muli, disaster preparedness manager for the <a href=\"http://www.kenyaredcross.org/\" title=\"\">Kenya Red Cross Society</a>, says the proposed amendments are in the right direction, but that it is almost as important to change the mindsets of Kenyan drivers. Road accidents claim between 3,000 and 15,000 lives every year in Kenya. With an estimated 34.4 deaths for every 100,000 people, Kenya's traffic mortality rate is the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/may/11/most-dangerous-roads#data\" title=\"\">16th highest in the world</a>.</p> <p>The causes include speeding; drinking and driving; poor signs; tired truck drivers; poorly trained drivers of public minibuses, known as <em>matatus</em>; a lack of public awareness, resulting in pedestrians darting across multi-lane highways; people crossing roads while talking on mobile phones; and badly maintained vehicles.</p> <p>Enforcement of the existing laws is a problem. Kenyan traffic police are notorious for taking bribes for minor offences rather than cracking down on drivers who brazenly flout traffic regulations.</p> <p>President Mwai Kibaki, who was injured in a car accident while travelling back to Nairobi from Machakos before the 2002 election, promised tougher traffic regulations during an address to the nation on 1 June. \"I am very concerned about the rampant use of mobile phones by drivers \u2026 We must also deal firmly with persons who drive under the influence of alcohol,\" Kibaki said. \"I urge traffic police officers to clamp down on these dangerous habits.\"</p> <p>Kibaki noted, however, that traffic police could not be at every junction and said Kenyans must develop a sense of personal responsibility.</p> <p>At the end of June, Midiwo's bill moved to the committee stage, where MPs will debate the amendments and approve or reject them. The bill's sponsor said he would seek input from other interested parties before presenting the bill to parliament for a third reading. \"My purpose was to ignite debate about the safety on our roads and the number of Kenyans dying \u2026 which is something we cannot ignore,\" he said.</p> <p>About 20,000 people are seriously injured in road accidents each year in a country where many people simply can't afford long-term medical treatment. According to the ministry of medical services, 65% of spinal injuries are due to road accidents.</p> <p>Muli says an entire culture needs to change. \"That's why some of the strategies that we are putting in place include social mobilisation, issues of social advocacy and media involvement,\" he said. \"It's about a culture that needs to be guided.\"</p> <p>Members of Kenya's social media networks seem to have embraced the need for change. Kenyans are tweeting about accidents they witness, advising caution, and outing drivers who drive dangerously, using the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/%23TwitterBigStick\">TwitterBigStick</a> hashtag.</p> <p>The Red Cross, which responds to 75% of road accidents, has more than <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KenyaRedCross\">30,000 followers on Twitter</a>. Every day, it posts traffic alerts, warnings and advice while \"iVolunteers\" post witness accounts. \"We have seen an increased interest and participation of the public on Twitter,\" said Muli. \"Nowadays, a lot of information is coming through Twitter and Facebook. This has improved the information flow.\"</p> <p>The day after the Machakos accident, the Red Cross posted a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kenya-Red-Cross-Society/104561442936505\" title=\"\">sober message on its Facebook page</a>: \"It is better to lose one minute in life than to lose life in a minute. Drive responsibly. Speed kills.\"</p> <p>But a few hours later, there was news of another horrific accident near Mombasa, again on the highway to Nairobi. This time the Red Cross tweeted that all 14 passengers were feared dead.</p>",
  "<p>The painting of a postbox in honour of Carl Hester's win, alongside Laura Bechtolsheimer and Charlotte Dujardin, in the team dressage at Greenwich Park on Tuesday is going to be a little more complicated than for other contestants.</p> <p>Hester comes from Sark in the Channel Islands, where the Royal Mail's writ does not run. But Guernsey Post, which is responsible for postal services on the island, has said it will follow the Royal Mail's lead and paint Sark's only postbox \u2013 currently blue \u2013 the appropriately celebratory colour.</p> <p>Hester's background is very unusual. He learned to ride on Sark, which has no cars, by riding on donkeys, and insists that his success gives the lie to the assertion that dressage is an inherently elitist sport. His argument is significant because, if dressage is to build a legacy from winning gold at Greenwich, it will need to recast its image.</p> <p>\"My parents aren't horsey \u2013 they can't stand horses, actually,\" he said after receiving his medal, \"so that makes it even more ridiculous that I've ended up on this route. The three of us come from totally different backgrounds. It's amazing I learned to balance and ride on a bareback donkey; Charlotte came through the showing world [riding ponies in shows]; and Laura did everything across all the equestrian disciplines before she took up dressage.\"</p> <p>Hester and Dujardin come from unmoneyed backgrounds, but Bechtolsheimer is the German-born granddaughter of a multimillionaire who made his fortune in property, and her father has made a huge investment in the sport. Nonetheless, Hester insisted it was hard work, not money that got him and his team-mates to the top.</p> <p>\"I grew up on Sark, the most ridiculously small island,\" he said. \"I left home at 16, said I wanted to go to England and do horses, and worked as a groom for many, many years. There's a story up here that any kid could aspire to. You have to have the right opportunities and you have to find your way, but the obvious answer is that hard work and dedication paid off for all three of us.\"</p> <p>Hester believes the gold \u2013 Britain's first ever dressage medal after decades of domination by Germany and the Netherlands \u2013 can take the sport in the UK to a new level. \"It's shot it into a different league,\" he said. But the sport has work to do to shake off its moneyed, top-hatted image. Ann Romney's ownership of the dressage horse Rafalca, which was eliminated from the individual competition at Greenwich after posting a disappointing score, has caused difficulties for her husband Mitt, the Republican presidential hopeful.</p> <p>The Democrats have used the horse as a stick with which to beat him, forcing him to distance himself from his wife's hobby, and US comedians have had a field day with what is widely seen as a sport that enshrines wealth and privilege.</p> <p>Satirist Stephen Colbert mocked claims made by Rafalca's rider, Jan Ebeling, that dressage was not exclusively a sport for the well-heeled. \"It's something you can do with a normal budget,\" said Colbert. \"Yeah, it's really all about budgeting. You cut out a couple of lattes a week. By the end of the month, you've got yourself a $3m Dutch warmblood.\"</p> <p>Claire Shand of the British Equestrian Federation said dressage's reputation as the preserve of the wealthy was undeserved. \"Dressage is accessible,\" she argued. \"You don't have to throw yourself over massive fences, and you don't need a big, expensive horse to do it. Winning here will be amazing for the sport.\"</p>"
