  "<p>It's encouraging, really. Republicans in the US are displaying a growing inability to suspend disbelief. They convinced themselves that Sarah Palin was The Answer for quite a few years. They thought the Tea Party was The Answer for a much briefer time. Mitt Romney was The Answer for a couple of months, his running mate Paul Ryan lasted a couple of weeks and Clint Eastwood, the thrilling mystery guest at this week's Republican Convention, remained the man who could inspire a turning point \u2013 until he was several paragraphs into his&#xa0;speech.</p> <p>Eastwood interrogated an imaginary Barack Obama about his inability to solve problems caused by the last Republican government, including a failure to check with the Russians before invading Afghanistan or deal with the nation's 23 million unemployed. It was as if Eastwood had commissioned Stewart Lee to write his speech, and every phrase had to be assumed to be dripping with irony.</p> <p>Obviously, US politics being as weird as they are, none of this guarantees Obama will secure a second term. After all, there's as yet no proof Republicans are unable to suspend disbelief for the three seconds it takes to vote.</p>",
  "<p>US central bank chief Ben Bernanke sparked a surge in share values on Friday after he signalled his willingness to embark on a third phase of money creation to boost the US economy.</p> <p>The Dow Jones industrial average closed the day with a gain of 90 points after the chairman of the Federal Reserve gave a robust defence of past central bank interventions, which, traders said, prepared the ground for a third round of quantitative easing should the economic picture worsen. France's CAC and the German DAX closed up 1%.</p> <p>In his much anticipated a speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Bernanke described the current economic situation as \"far from satisfactory\". He said that high rates of unemployment were a \"grave concern, not only because of the enormous suffering and waste of human talent it entails, but also because persistently high levels of unemployment will wreak structural damage on our economy that could last for years\".</p> <p>His speech to the annual central bank symposium came ahead of September's meeting of the Federal Reserve's open markets committee (FOMC), which sets US economic policy. Recently released minutes from its last meeting show the committee has become increasingly concerned about the US recovery and is weighing further action.</p> <p>However, since the last FOMC meeting, more positive economic news has emerged on jobs and housing. Next week the closely watched non-farm payroll survey of monthly employment trends will be released. After a sharp rise over the winter, job growth slowed in the spring, but appears to be picking up again.</p> <p>He urged European leaders to make faster progress in tackling the debt crisis affecting Greece and other indebted eurozone countries. His concerns that Europe may drag the US back into recession were highlighted by figures showing that unemployment across the zone remained at an all-time high in July.</p> <p>The European Union's statistical agency, Eurostat, said 88,000 more people were without a job in July, pushing the total out of work in the eurozone to 18m, the highest level since monetary union in 1999.</p> <p>The 11.3% unemployment rate, up 1.2 points from a year earlier, failed to come down after joblessness increased in Spain and bailed-out Greece. In Spain youth unemployment stood at 52.9%, in Greece at 53.8%.</p> <p>Any monetary action by the Fed is likely to trigger a furious response from elements within the Republican party who have criticised his past actions and warned against new measures.</p> <p>Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate, has made it clear he will replace the Fed chief, who he accuses of putting taxpayers' cash at risk, if he is elected in November.</p> <p>The House financial services committee chairman, Spencer Bachus, told Bernanke last month at a congressional hearing: \"The truth is the Federal Reserve cannot rescue Americans from the consequences of failed economic and regulatory policies passed by Congress and signed by the president.\"</p> <p>The initial US quantitative easing programme from November 2008 to May 2010 saw the Fed buy $1.75tn in debt held by mortgage providers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a range of mortgage-backed securities and government bonds, mostly from the country's 3,000 banks.</p> <p>A second round, dubbed QE2, involved an additional $600bn. \"Operation Twist\" began in September 2011 with a pledge to swap $400bn in short-term loans for longer term bonds, with an extension in June adding a further $267bn.</p> <p>Bernanke offered a strong defence of his actions at Jackson Hole. \"A balanced reading of the evidence supports the conclusion that central bank securities purchases have provided meaningful support to the economic recovery while mitigating deflationary risks,\" he said.</p> <p>In a swipe at Republican critics who accuse him of jeopardising hundreds of billions of taxpayer funds following the expansion of Federal Reserve loans, he said loans by the Fed since the bank rescues of 2008 had earned money for the exchequer.</p> <p>David Zervos, head of global fixed income strategy at US investment bank Jefferies, said it was unlikely the Fed would back a further round of central bank lending before the presidential election in November.</p> <p>\"The idea that the Fed would come out with unconventional monetary policy, such as credit easing of some kind, seems to be a little bit of a stretch,\" he said.</p> <p>\"This was a backstop speech that gets Bernanke through. If the data turns or Europe turns, then the Fed is back in.\"</p> <p>Gus Faucher, senior economist at PNC Financial Services, said: \"It sure sounds to me like he is getting ready to act.\"</p> <p>He said the FOMC would now be waiting for the non-farm payroll figures. In July, the US added 163,000 new jobs, more than many economists had expected. Faucher is predicting that 130,000 new jobs were added in August, while other analysts are expecting about 100,000.</p> <p>\"If it comes in below 100,000, I think the Fed will act,\" he said. \"That would be four out of five months below 100,000. That's not good enough.\"</p>",
  "<p>The drowned town of Braithwaite slowly emerged from flood waters on Friday, revealing two bodies and ruined homes as a weakened storm Isaac moved further inland, drenching Arkansas and Missouri.</p> <p>The scale of the clean-up facing Louisiana, battered by hurricane force winds and rain earlier in the week, was starkest here as officials and homeowners used boats to inspect submerged properties.</p> <p>Mitt Romney, fresh from the Republican convention in Tampa, toured the area to survey the damage and recovery efforts on Friday after an invitation from the Louisiana governor, Bobby Jindal. The White House said Barack Obama would also visit.</p> <p>Insurers will face a bill between $700m to $2bn, a fraction of the $41bn cost of Hurricane Katrina which devastated New Orleans seven years ago this week, said the risk-modeling firm AIR Worldwide. Around 700,000 homes and businesses in Louisiana and Mississippi were still without power on Friday \u2013 down from a peak of 1m \u2013 but airports, oil refineries and other infrastructure were returning to normal. Midwest farmers hoped the rain would ease a drought without damaging crops.</p> <p>Romney's visit and President Barack Obama's attention to Isaac \u2013 he declared the impact on Louisiana and Mississippi major disasters in order to release federal aid \u2013 underlined both candidates' determination to avoid comparisons with George Bush's much-criticised response to Katrina.</p> <p>In Braithwaite, residents assessed the damage. \"Just look at that, everything completely submerged,\" said Jimmy Delery, 57, a land and property owner as he inspected Braithwaite's rooftops from a motorboat. \"We thought we knew so much about hurricanes, but we're learning so much more.\"</p> <p>Residents without boats waited on higher ground for the water to recede. Officials used a digger to claw a hole in the town's earthen levee to speed up the draining.</p> <p>\"I'm doing OK for now but I know it'll hit me when I get in there and see my home,\" said Melanie Martinez, who was rescued from her rooftop on Wednesday with her family soon after Isaac made landfall. \"We thought we were going to die in that house; the water was coming up so fast.\"</p> <p>Two neighbours did not make it. The bodies of the man and woman, who were not immediately named, were found in a kitchen, apparently drowned.</p> <p>A $14.5bn federal flood defence upgrade since the 2005 Katrina catastrophe, when 1,800 peopled died, was credited with averting serious damage in New Orleans but semi-rural communities on its outskirts such as Braithwaite relied on a more basic, state-built 8ft levee which proved no match for the waters.</p> <p>Many residents said the higher defences around New Orleans channelled the surge to them. \"All that water had to go somewhere. Well, it came here,\" said Eric Desalvo, 20.</p> <p>The storm also damaged a dam on Lake Tangipahoa in Mississippi, prompting concerns on Thursday it could break, but authorities late said an intentional, controlled breach neutralised the danger.</p> <p>Romney and Jindal toured flooded communities around the fishing town of Lafitte, south of New Orleans. Aides and media follows in SUVs and open topped army trucks.</p> <p>Some residents welcomed Romney with homemade posters saying \"Go Mitt\" and \"Mitt is our man\".</p> <p>The Republican candidate spoke with rescue workers and local officials and residents. Many complained at the lack of flood protection.</p> <p>\"I was expecting a politician but he was understanding and caring,\" said Jodie Chuarello, 42, whose home disappeared under 12ft of water. She accused Obama of neglecting the area. \"I don't think he has done anything to help.\"</p> <p>Obama will visit the area on Monday.</p>",
  "<p>Despite Neil Armstrong's legendary humility, there were moments of pomp and circumstance at his memorial service on Friday. A corps of bagpipers played When the Saints Go Marching In, a navy ceremonial guard was presented, and at the end four fighter planes flew overhead \u2013 one of them vertically, in a nod to the astronaut's skills as a rocket man.</p> <p>But Armstrong, who spent the past 43 years trying to shrug off the unwanted attentions that came with his celebrity status as the first person to set foot on the moon, would have approved of the ceremony being held firmly behind closed doors. \"This service is closed to the media \u2013 with no exceptions\", <a href=\"http://neilarmstronginfo.com/\">a note put out by the family pointedly directed.</a> Only one camera, that of Nasa photographer Bill Ingalls, was permitted to record the event.</p> <p>Hundreds of people turned up at a private golf club in the suburbs of Cincinnati to pay their respects to a man who did so much but bragged about it so little. Armstrong died last Saturday, aged 82.</p> <p>Among the 10 or so space pioneers who attended were the two men who crewed alongside Armstrong in the Apollo 11 mission \u2013 Edwin \"Buzz\" Aldrin, who followed Armstrong onto the moon's surface on 20 July 1969, and Michael Collins, who remained commanding the module that orbited 60 miles over their heads.</p> <p>Also there were John Glenn, the first American to orbit the earth, and Bill Anders, the module pilot for Apollo 8, which paved the way for the moon landing by carrying out the first manned lunar orbit in December 1968. \"You'll never get a hero, in my view, like Neil Armstrong,\" he told Associated Press after the service. \"It's going to be hard to top.\"</p> <p>Charles Bolden, Nasa's administrator, said Armstrong was an \"incredibly humble\" man with a courageous thirst for exploration. \"He was the embodiment of everything this nation is all about,\" he said.</p> <p>In recognition of the public desire to commemorate such a legendary figure, the Armstrong family has arranged following the private service for a national memorial event in Washington on 12 September. They also invited people wanting to mark his death to think of him and wink up at the moon.</p> <p>As if the moon had been listening, it duly performed its own service in honour of the first person to stand upon its surface by rising in full form on Friday night for the second time in the calendar month. Such \"blue moons\" happen on average but every three years \u2013 hence the expression that flows from it, itself a fitting tribute to a man of such rare qualities.</p> <p>Speeches at the Cincinnati service were given by Armstrong's two sons, Eric and Mark; one of his 10 grandchildren, Piper Van Wagenen; and by Rob Portman, a senator for Ohio who delivered the eulogy. \"He touched the lives of so many,\" Portman said after the service which he described as a combination of emotion and humour.</p> <p>The choice of Portman as eulogist was something of a paradox. Despite his own track record working across party political lines, Portman recently came close to being chosen as Mitt Romney's running mate in a presidential campaign characterised by extreme partisanship and an emphasis on small government. During his career, however, Portman was known for efforts to foster bipartisan support for the causes he championed.</p> <p>By contrast, Armstrong's historic act in walking on the moon was the ultimate manifestation of post-war American consensus and faith in big government. It was initiated under John F Kennedy's Democratic administration and seen through by the Republican Richard Nixon.</p> <p>Earlier in the day, Jim Lovell who commanded the stricken moon mission Apollo 13 and Eugene Cernan, the last person to walk on the moon with Apollo 17 in 1972, launched a children's health fund in Armstrong's honour at Cincinnati Children's hospital medical center. At the ceremony, Lovell called Armstrong \"a great American\" who just \"wanted to be a team player.\"</p> <p>Cernan added: \"There's nobody that I know of that could have accepted the challenge and responsibility that came with [the first moon landing] with more dignity than Neil Armstrong.\"</p> <p>The two men recalled how they had visited Armstrong at his home in Indian Hill just two months before his death this week from complications from a heart-bypass operation. Armstrong cooked breakfast for them both, though they noted that he overcooked the eggs.</p>",

  "<p>The Republican Party has much in common with Andre Parker, responsible for what has been described as American football's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2012/aug/31/american-football-kent-state-andre-parker-video?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">worst play.</a> Kent State University's linebacker grabbed the ball and ran for 58 yards \u2013 towards his own goal line. After dashing with such purpose in the direction of their own political end zone, epitomised by Clint Eastwood's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/31/clint-eastwood-chair-speech-romney\" title=\"\">cameo appearance as Mad Harry</a>, Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are miles away from where they need to be to unseat the Democrat from the White House. Tapping into the mindset of independents or swing voters \u2013 people who want the economy to get moving, but who expect Medicare to be waiting there for them when it does \u2013 still remains an exercise in distance learning.</p> <p>They set out on their long trek with two <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/31/romney-campaign-trail-presidential-pitch\" title=\"\">deeply mendacious speeches</a>. Mr Ryan's lies were more barefaced: he blamed the incumbent president for the closure of a General Motors plant which went belly up under his predecessor. Mr Romney's rewriting of recent history was just as bold. According to him, the Republicans in Congress accepted Mr Obama's victory in 2008 and, being the good and generous people that they are, rallied round his presidency. They did not block everything he did, or threaten to send government finances over a cliff, twice. The most partisan and obstructionist opposition in history has all been one giant misunderstanding. In a similar vein, Bain Capital was a \"small\" company that \"helped\" other businesses. The man with more wealth than the eight most recent presidents combined ended this section by reaching out to Americans on two jobs at $9 an hour. The hallucinogen powerful enough to cast Mr Romney as a man of the poor has not yet been confected.</p> <p>For most of what was billed as the most important speech of his career, he attempted to answer a question that he should have answered long ago, but which still lingers awkwardly in his party's mind. He is, afterall, the least popular nominee in almost 30 years. So who is he ? To answer that, Mr Romney delved into his family history, territory he has been understandably reluctant to enter. If humanising Mitt was the central task of his speechwriters, what did we learn? That his dad loved his mom? Did they really have that little to go on? The elisions in his narrative were more interesting than the inclusions. His only tenure of public office, as governor of Massachusetts, went unmentioned. This would have appealed to swing voters for the very reason that it horrified those in his own party who still harbour suspicions of him as a crypto-Democrat. Not just because he passed a healthcare reform uncannily similar to the one he attacked Mr Obama for, but because he was (then, not now) a pragmatic centrist. So the real answer to the question of who he is \u2013 the caring Mormon neighbour, the ruthless CEO, the centrist governor, the machine politician \u2013 will probably not help him. He has glided through, and discarded, much of a large wardrobe of personae with no particular memory of, or attachment to, any one of them. That hardened husk of a candidate you see now is what you will get as president. It is why he has been such a hard sell.</p> <p>There is much for the Democrats to aim at, at their convention next week. Mr Ryan and Mr Romney landed only one punch apiece by casting Mr Obama as the dreamer whose promise to heal the world ruined the lives of folk in his own backyard. This also is a piece of fiction, as most Americans realise. The latest Washington Post-ABC poll showed that 54 % blamed George W Bush for the current economic problems, compared with 32 % who blamed Mr Obama. But the image of the failed poster boy is potent. How many of the people who thronged the Washington Mall on Mr Obama's inauguration now regret having done so? The battle lines are drawn. It is between a president the country could well be ready to part with and a man not plausible enough to be his replacement.</p>",
  "<p>If you're outside the United States, in Britain say, the last time you checked in Mitt Romney was the privileged, h<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgeQ_y7LMRI\" title=\"\">apless candidate born with a silver foot in his mouth</a> who had managed to screw up what should have been the easiest possible assignment \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/27/britain-easy-date-mitt-romney-mess\" title=\"\">making nice to London on the eve of the Olympics</a> \u2013 and was surely destined to go down to defeat in November at the hands of that master rhetorician and campaigner, Barack Obama.</p> <p>If that's your view, you may want to sit down. For Romney and Obama are now locked in a bitingly tight contest, one that the Republican candidate has a good \u2013 and increasing \u2013 prospect of winning. On 7 November there is an even, maybe better than even, chance that the world will wake up to President Romney.</p> <p>This is not a verdict on Romney's speech here in Florida, formally accepting his party's nomination. That was a bland affair \u2013 even supporters called it \"workmanlike\" \u2013 which drew a tepid response in the hall. Nor did Romney reveal previously hidden gifts for oratory or suddenly show himself to be a warm, telegenic match for Obama. Instead it is an assessment of the basic political reality, one in which those defects of Romney's might not even matter.</p> <p>Start with two numbers that are horrible for Obama. The first is his poll rating, which remains stubbornly below 50%. History suggests that incumbent presidents unable to break the 50% barrier at this stage end up serving just one term. The second figure, which goes a long way to explaining the first, <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/breaking/chi-chijulyunemploymentjulyjobsreport-20120803,0,6114456.story\" title=\"\">is the statistic that puts US unemployment at 8.3%</a>. Joblessness has not stood below 8% since the month Obama took office. Again, the&#xa0;historical record is brutal on sitting presidents seeking re-election against such a bleak economic backdrop. The last one to pull it off was Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1936.</p> <p>Viewed like that, the fact that Obama is even in a statistical dead-heat with Romney nationally is quite an achievement. It has come thanks in part to an aerial bombardment of TV advertising by the Obama campaign in decisive states, consisting mainly of 30-second attacks on Romney, depicting him as a corporate vulture who won't tell the truth about how much tax he pays. That such a heavy assault has only managed to result in stalemate illustrates the gravity of the president's situation.</p> <p>What's more, a serious Romney counter-attack is on the way. Under the rules of campaign finance, the Republican only gained access to his full war-chest on Thursday night, when he became his party's formal nominee. Unusually for a challenger, he is comprehensively out-fundraising Obama, <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2012/08/22/news/economy/obama-romney-fundraising/index.html\" title=\"\">pulling in more than $200m in June and July alone</a>. Romney is backed too by a series of so-called Super Pacs (political action committees), officially unaffiliated bodies that are able to keep the source of their funds secret and who can spend unlimited amounts on TV commercials. Obama has some Super Pac allies of his own, but here too Romney has the advantage.</p> <p>The coming phase of the campaign holds further bright possibilities for the Republican candidate. Yes, Obama will get his moment in the sun next week as Democrats gather for their convention in Charlotte. But any momentum could come to an abrupt halt on Friday, when the latest job statistics are published.</p> <p>October brings three live TV debates between the two men, often landmark moments in a presidential contest. Of course these could go either way. If Romney stumbles so badly that he is deemed an implausible president, his bid will be over. But he is an experienced debater, battle-hardened by bruising primary campaigns this year and in 2008. And debates often help the challenger simply by putting him alongside the president, thereby granting him equal status.</p> <p>It's true that Romney is a stiff performer and cannot rival the charm and ease of Barack Obama. Likability usually matters a lot in US elections. But this could just be the year when it matters less. The case Republicans presented in Tampa was that the economy needs to be fixed and that Romney is the man to fix it. They point to a CV that shows Romney has succeeded in every task he has undertaken, whether as governor of Massachusetts or salvaging the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. So what if he can't emote and looks permanently awkward? He's a proven turnaround artist and, as his wife, Ann, said on Tuesday: <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ann-romney-tells-women-husband-us/story?id=17098633\" title=\"\">\"This man will not fail.\"</a></p> <p>Judged like this, Romney will not have to prove he's likable so much as \"acceptable\", say some of his senior allies, and that is a much lower bar. Thursday night's testimonials from church members Romney had helped as a Mormon lay pastor \u2013 telling clearly genuine stories of Romney coming to the aid of families faced with tragedy, including sitting with a dying 14-year-old boy who had asked for Romney's help drafting a will \u2013 suggest a way the candidate might clear that bar easily.</p> <p>Of course, Obama retains&#xa0;big advantages. Many Americans still like him and think well of him. They believe he has tried his best, having been dealt a tough hand by his predecessor. They credit him with the removal of&#xa0;America's number one enemy and the&#xa0;rescue of the country's car industry. As the bumper sticker has it: \"Bin Laden's dead and GM's alive.\"</p> <p>They still do not know Mitt Romney well and might yet be persuaded that he is a pampered plutocrat whose wife owns \"a couple of Cadillacs\" and who is out&#xa0;of touch, whose own&#xa0;policy reversals over the years \u2013 on&#xa0;abortion and the like \u2013 suggest a hollowness, a willingness to do or say anything to gain power.</p> <p>Obama's campaign team is probably the more skilled. The Romney crowd can still mess up: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/aug/31/clint-eastwood-obama-gop-convention-video?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">witness the debacle of Clint Eastwood's Dada-ist performance</a> in Tampa, talking to an empty chair. The control-freaks around Obama would have taken no such risk. And the Democrats retain key demographic advantages, favoured by Americans who are black, Hispanic, young or female. The electoral map is helpful too: in the states he has to win, the president is ahead. But that will not matter much if Romney pulls even a couple of percentage points ahead. Al Gore in 2000 apart, winners of the overall popular vote tend to become president.</p> <p>Put simply, if you thought of Mitt Romney as a joke figure bound to lose in November and soon to be forgotten, think again. This election is knife-edge close \u2013 and, to state what for many around the world will be an unwelcome truth, that means either man could win.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/j_freedland\" title=\"\"><em>@j_freedland</em></a></p>",

He was relaxed and smiling. Asked whether he was about to win his battle against his former friend and fellow oligarch Roman Abramovich, he replied: \"I'm confident. I believe in the system.\"</p> <p>Fifteen minutes later the same English justice system \u2013 in the formidable shape of Mrs Justice Gloster \u2013 gave Berezovsky an almighty and devastating kick up the backside. The judge dismissed his case and his claim that he was a partner with Abramovich in the Russian oil group Sibneft. But worse than this she also demolished Berezovsky's character, describing him in her judgment as \"dishonest\", \"unreliable\" and even \"deluded\".</p> <p>Instead of emerging with $5bn (\u00a33.15bn) in damages, as he had hoped, Berezovsky left with a huge legal bill and his reputation in tatters. He had told the court that Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea FC, had intimidated him to sell his share in the oil firm Sibneft at a massive discount. Abramovich vehemently denied this.</p> <p>But who would the judge believe? At 10.30am Gloster walked into court. There was a dramatic hush. The first three rows were packed with lawyers \u2013 the true winners in this, the biggest private litigation battle in history. There were journalists and supporters. Berezovsky sat near the door. Two bodyguards with earpieces were behind him. Abramovich wasn't there, his whereabouts a mystery. \"He's probably on his yacht in Corfu or Marbella,\" someone whispered.</p> <p>First, Gloster threw out Berezovsky's case. Then she gave her reasons. They were withering, in the kind of remorseless language rarely heard in the high court. Berezovsky, we discovered, had destroyed himself early on in the witness box. \"On my analysis of the entirety of the evidence, I found Mr Berezovsky an unimpressive, and inherently unreliable, witness, who regarded truth as a transitory, flexible concept, which could be moulded to suit his current purposes,\" the judge said.</p> <p>Berezovsky clutched his face. She went on: \"At times the evidence which he gave was deliberately dishonest; sometimes he was clearly making his evidence up as he went along in response to the perceived difficulty in answering the questions in a manner consistent with his case.</p> <p>\"At other times, I gained the impression that he was not necessarily being deliberately dishonest, but had deluded himself into believing his own version of events. On occasions he tried to avoid answering questions by making long and irrelevant speeches, or by professing to have forgotten facts which he had been happy to record in his pleadings or witness statements.\"</p> <p>It was Berezovsky's most excruciating moment, and the worst since he fled to Britain in 2000. Berezovsky left Russia after falling out with the steely Vladimir Putin, and has been a bitter critic of the Kremlin ever since. President Putin has had a grudge against the British judicial system since it granted Berezovsky political asylum in 2003. Putin could have been forgiven for allowing himself a wry grin, as another court comprehensively trashed Berezovsky's reputation.</p> <p>Abramovich, by contrast, has been a model of political loyalty. He is said to be on good terms with Putin. Many have wondered how the diffident and unassuming Abramovich became one of the richest people on the planet. The case provided the answer, with even Berezovsky admitting he was \"very charming\". In his witness statement Berezovsky said that Abramovich's secret was simple: he was \"good at getting people to like him\".</p> <p>Certainly some of this appears to have worked on Gloster. The judge told the court she concluded Abramovich was a \"truthful and on the whole reliable witness\". He \"gave careful and thoughtful answers, which were focused on the specific issues about which he was being questioned.\" She added: \"At all times, he was concerned to ensure that he understood the precise question, and the precise premise underlying the question which he was being asked.\"</p> <p>Forty minutes into the judgment, it was clear Abramovich had won game, set and match. The judge dismissed in \"its entirety\" Berezovsky's claim that he had been a partner in Sibneft, set up in the mid-1990s when Russia's then president, Boris Yeltsin, practically gifted state assets to a small group of well-connected businessmen: the oligarchs. (In return they helped him dubiously win Russia's 1996 election.) She also rejected a second Berezovsky claim for $564m, his alleged share of a joint interest with Abramovich in the aluminium group Rusal.</p> <p>Instead, Gloster accepted Abramovich's version of history: that he had been compelled to hire Berezovsky for his political connections. Back in 1994 Berezovsky was Yeltsin's occasional tennis-partner and a powerful figure in the corridors of the Kremlin. Abramovich was a young and ambitious oil trader. Gloster accepted the relationship had been one of \"<em>krysha</em>\" \u2013 the Russian word for roof \u2013 with Berezovsky giving Abramovich physical and political protection, indispensable in the murky world of Russian business. (The judge prounounced \"krysha\" to rhyme with Trisha, rather than the Russian way, \"kreesha\".)</p> <p>The judge even ruled that Putin hadn't tried to intimidate Berezovsky into selling his TV channel ORT, during an uncomfortable Kremlin showdown in 2000, shortly before Berezovsky fled. Her finding prompted seasoned Russian watchers to guffaw. Afterwards, a stunned Berezovsky emerged into the corridor. The judge had tried to rewrite Russian history, he said, adding that his faith in British justice had now been badly shaken. Had he expected to win? \"Absolutely.\"</p> <p>In the street outside, Berezovsky said he hadn't decided yet whether to appeal \u2013 a tricky step, one suspects, given the judge's devastating comments. \"I'm absolutely amazed what happened today. I'm surprised completely,\" Berezovsky said. He added: \"Sometimes I had the impression Putin himself wrote this judgment.\" The oligarch said he didn't regret bringing the case, and even attempted a phlegmatic note, observing: \"Life is life,\" before speeding off in a black Mercedes.</p> <p>Abramovich's lawyers said they were pleased their client had been \"comprehensively vindicated\". They added: \"We appreciate that, to many people, this case has been a uniquely Russian one, and should therefore have been heard in the Russian court system. Nevertheless, Mr Abramovich has always had great faith in the fairness of the English legal system and is both pleased and grateful for today's outcome.\"</p> <p>All that remains now is to tot up the legal bills. The court heard that Berezovsky had recently sold his luxury home in Wentworth, Surrey, and was busily \"disposing of assets\". This has fuelled rumours that the one-time billionaire is now down to his last few millions, a pauper by the standards of Russia's elite. Berezovsky said he would not discuss his assets.</p> <p>As well as the elusive Abramovich, one other person was missing from the lop-sided drama: Abramovich's barrister Jonathan Sumption QC. Sumption realised early on that the key to the case was character, and convincing the judge Berezovsky was a wrong 'un. The strategy worked. He has more than earned his fee \u2013 rumoured to be in excess of \u00a31m. And what's more he is now a supreme court judge and a lord, further proof perhaps that Britain is good at delivering justice.</p>",

Certainly little that Mitt Romney or Paul Ryan said lingers in the memory.</p> <p>Two moments, though, stand out. One was the extraordinarily moving tribute paid to Mitt Romney by <a href=\"http://foxnewsinsider.com/2012/08/30/video-transcript-pam-finlaysons-emotional-rnc-speech/#more-94348\">Pamela Finlayson</a>, one of his parishioners in Massachusetts. She described how the Romneys helped her family as they struggled with their premature daughter, and 26 years later were still caring. I'd have voted for Mitt if the election had been held when Finlayson finished speaking.</p> <p>The other was the powerful keynote <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/80421.html\">addresses</a> by two governors, Nikki Haley of South Carolina and Susana Martinez of New Mexico. Haley's speech was the most accomplished of the convention, but Martinez's exhibited a quiet confidence that singles her out as a future party leader. \"As the first Hispanic female governor in history, little girls often come up to me in the grocery store or the mall,\" said Martinez. \"They look and point, and when they get the courage, they ask 'Are you Susana?' and they run up and give me a hug. And I wonder: how do you know who I am?\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395815801\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/9/28/1317225418768/Annmarie_Cox.jpg\" alt=\"Ana Marie Cox\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Ana Marie Cox:</strong> My favorite convention moment was actually one of the most ordinary: I had a conversation with someone. Looking for women to talk about the GOP platform with, I found a lady who was a senior-citizen black alternate delegate from Nebraska. She single-handedly embodied half of the contradictions at the center of the 2012 contest, including the fact that she was utterly gracious and willing to spend quite a bit of time talking very reasonably about issues many want to avoid. We talked about abortion, about broken families, even about Ron Paul. After a week of being reminded at every turn of the anger at the heart of the Republican message, I hope I can keep in mind the potential for real conversation once we meet each other face-to-face.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395815802\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/4/19/1334856266547/Adam-Gabbatt-byline-pic-003.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Gabbatt byline pic\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adam Gabbatt byline pic.

These are people under 29, well educated, who believe in the Republican core of small government and lower taxes. They just happen to be homosexual.</p> <p>Unfortunately, that means that outside of groups like the Log Cabin Republicans, there isn't much of a place for them within the modern GOP. It was interesting to hear the people I spoke to put forward the idea that Republicans, as individual freedom champions, shouldn't give two hoots about what goes on behind closed doors between consenting adults. Unfortunately, the party is in such a thrall to the rightwing, God fearing base, that change is unlikely from a top down level any time soon - and while you have someone like Rick Santorum trotting around the country comparing gay sex to \"man on dog\", Republicans are unlikely to attract the kind of socially liberal members who could effect change at a grass roots level.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395815803\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/01/21/ewen_macaskill_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Ewen Macaskill\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Ewen MacAskill:</strong> There are two main contenders for moment of the week at the Republican convention: Clint Eastwood's meltdown on stage, and the star turn by former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice.</p> <p>Eastwood, though an actor, offered up a rambling, at times almost incoherent, speech. He was the 'mystery guest', the element of surprise. When he took to the stage at first, it seemed to work, his appearance dramatic, against a screen backdrop of one his most popular roles The Man With No Name. Although he was cheered throughout by convention delegate at the time, the postmortem was less charitable. He ran well over his alloted slot, throwing out the schedule, meaning Mitt Romney overshot his primetime television slot.</p> <p>Rice, though well known as a speaker at foreign policy thinktanks, was not generally regarded as a politician. She was seen as primarily academic. Along with Florida senator Marco Rubio, she turned in one of the best performances of the week. She brought to life what had until that point been a listless convention, at which delegates had been milling around, barely listening to the speakers. Her best line was that she was able to rise from segregated Alabama, unable to eat a hamburger in a Woolworth store, to become secretary of state. And one day president, perhaps?<br></p> <p><strong>MaribelleFL:</strong> I will remember Marco Rubio's speech the most. Truly the best speech. The best part ...</p> <blockquote> <p>Our problem with President Obama isn't that he's a bad person. By all accounts, he too is a good husband, and a good father \u2014 and thanks to lots of practice, a pretty good golfer. Our problem is he's a bad president.</p> <p>The new slogan for the president's campaign is \"Forward.\" A government that spends $1 trillion more than it takes in. An $800 billion stimulus that created more debt than jobs. A government intervention into health care paid for with higher taxes and cuts to Medicare. Scores of new rules and regulations.</p> <p>These ideas don't move us 'Forward', they take us backwards. These are tired and old big government ideas. Ideas that people come to America to get away from. Ideas that threaten to make America more like the rest of the world, instead of helping the world become more like America.</p> <p>Under Barack Obama, the only \"Change\" is that \"Hope\" has been hard to find.<br>Now millions of Americans are insecure about their future. But instead of inspiring us by reminding us of what makes us special, he divides us against each other. He tells Americans they're worse off because others are better off. That people got rich by making others poor. Hope and Change has become Divide and Conquer.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>TheBonsaiKid:</strong> The moment Mitt Romney said \"President Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans and heal the planet.\" pulling a silly face and enjoying the laughs.</p> <p>The very idea of climate change dismissed as a joke unworthy of even commenting on. It just seemed to embody the detachment from reality of the whole shebang.</p> <p><strong>sbanicki: </strong>Here is what Barack Obama and the Democrats need to do at next weeks convention. They need to explain the contrast between the Democratic parties platform and the platform revealed by the Republicans last week. While doing this, major falsehoods expressed by Republicans must be addressed.</p> <p>Obama must debunk the fallacy that the country is worse off than it was four years ago. The events causing the collapse of housing and stock markets did not happen in the fall of 2008. The fall of 2008 was when the market, and thus the country, acknowledged the devastation of home values brought about by sub-prime lending throughout the first eight years of this century.</p> <p>In the normal course of banking and finance, holders of financial assets are required to establish a reserve for losses against assets acquired. When a bank makes a car loan they immediately set up a loss reserve. No lender expects a specific loan to default on the day the loan is made. However, an experienced lender knows that a certain percentage of loans made will end up in default. He just does not know which specific loans will fail.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Over to you!

  "<p>Mitt Romney's election team has declared they are confident that the road to the White House lies open as their candidate headed out on his first full day of campaigning as the Republican presidential nominee.</p> <p>His schedule took in a surprise visit to Louisiana to speak to \u2013 and be pictured with \u2013 the emergency crews dealing with the flood damage created by hurricane Isaac.</p> <p>Reaction to the biggest speech of his political career \u2013 his address to the party convention in Tampa, Florida \u2013 was mixed, in large part because of a shambling warm-up performance by Oscar-winning actor Clint Eastwood. The actor disrupted the carefully choreographed convention schedule with with a surreal discussion with an empty chair representing Barack Obama.</p> <p>Republican strategists described Romney's 40-minute speech as \"competent\" and \"solid\" rather than inspirational, but insisted that it would play well with the tens of millions of viewers watching at home. Alex Castellanos, a Republican consultant and media commentator, said Romney had ticked all the boxes. \"I thought he did a workmanlike job,\" he said.</p> <p>A former member of the Bush administration, speaking after the speech in Tampa, described it as \"homely\" and low-key but said it would resonate with voters tired with Obama's soaring rhetoric.</p> <p>Romney heeded the advice of his strategists to make the speech personal, with sections in which he dwelt on his family life. His wife Ann, on television Friday morning, said it offered a glimpse into \"the deepest part of his soul\".</p> <p>She diplomatically avoided any hint of criticism of Eastwood's performance, confining her comment to \"unique\". In an interview with CBS, she tactfully added: \"We appreciated Clint's support, of course.\"</p> <p>In his speech, Romney spoke about two of his biggest perceived weaknesses, his Mormonism, which is normally avoids for fear of offending Christian evangelicals, and his business career at Bain Capital, an investment group that closed American companies, resulting in job losses.</p> <p>But there was little of substance in the speech, other than a vague five-point plan for tackling the sluggish economic recovery and a few brief foreign policy references.</p> <p>A senior member of Romney's campaign team, scanning the coming two months, insisted it was looking good for the candidate. He pointed to the unemployment figures coming out next week, again in October and again just days before the election, which would remind voters of the issue that is their main concern. He said that it would take a \"miracle\" for Obama to win, given that no president since the 1930s had won re-election with unemployment over 8%.</p> <p>The campaign adviser also saw a huge advantage for Romney in terms of spending. Having been formally adopted as the Republican nominee, he can now legally spend the millions of dollars he has been accumulating.</p> <p>Romney's campaign team cautioned against expecting much of a poll bounce, especially with the Democrats likely to be the centre of media attention next week, with their convention in Charlotte, North Carolina.</p> <p>The Democratic party derided Romney's speech for lack of policy. In a campaign video on the web, the Democrats said: \"Thursday was Mitt Romney's big night to tell America his plans for moving forward, yet he chose not to.\"</p> <p>David Axelrod, one of Obama's campaign strategists, in a television interview focused on Republicans who made speeches mainly talking up themselves rather than Romney. He contemptuously dismissed Tampa as \"more like open mic night for 2016 candidates, and not a convention that's aimed at promoting Mitt Romney in 2012.\"</p> <p>The media response to the speech was mixed. Time's <a href=\"http://swampland.time.com/2012/08/31/the-romney-speech/\">Joe Klein wrote</a> that it was a \"smart speech\" but that he was not sure that it was a game-changer, or would be remembered beyond tomorrow. Klein added: \"But it did lay down a subtle challenge for the president: explain why your contract should be extended.\"</p> <p>The main theme of Romney's speech, one that will be pursued over the coming weeks by the campaign, is that Obama was elected in a wave of euphoria but that his first term is ending in disappointment.</p> <p>\"I wish President Obama had succeeded because I want America to succeed,\" Romney said. \"But his promises gave way to disappointment and division. This isn't something we have to accept. Now is the moment when we can do something. With your help we will do something.\"</p> <p>The heart of Romney's speech was a five-point plan for economic recovery that he promised would deliver 12 million new jobs within four years. The plan \u2013 deliberately lacking in detail \u2013 covered energy independence, small business, deficit reduction, skills training and international trade, and included the veiled threat of a trade war with China.</p> <p>Romney touched on foreign policy only briefly, pledging to show \"backbone\" to Russian president Vladimir Putin and deriding Obama for failing to halt Iran's nuclear development. While he praised Obama for ordering the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, there was no mention of other international issues, notably Afghanistan, and in the main he focused on attacking Obama's domestic record.</p> <p>He promised to repeal Obama's healthcare reform and vowed: \"As president I will protect the sanctity of life. I will honour the institution of marriage. And I will guarantee America's first liberty: the freedom of religion.\"</p>",
  "<p>President <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/30/angola-jose-eduardo-dos-santos\" title=\"\">Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos</a>, the second longest serving leader in Africa, looks on course to retain power after Angolans voted in an election dogged by alleged irregularities and what appeared a low turnout.</p> <p>Dos Santos's Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, or MPLA, is predicted to win comfortably and extend his 33-year rule. But the main opposition party, Unita, denounced the process as flawed from the start and said it would challenge the outcome in court.</p> <p>Political activists claimed thousands of people had boycotted the election, the third in the country's history, because of a lack of faith in its integrity. A few polling stations visited by the Guardian in Luanda had a trickle of voters but were mostly deserted.</p> <p>The ballot has focused attention on Angola's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/30/angola-elections-china-oil-growing-inequality\" title=\"\">remarkable but uneven progress</a>. A decade after the end of a devastating 27-year civil war, it is sub-Saharan Africa's second biggest oil producer and third biggest economy. But critics accuse Dos Santos of internal repression, enriching his family while millions languish in poverty and merely paying lip service to democracy. The past year has seen growing protests from youth activists and rappers.</p> <p>\"Democracy is the power of the people and today the people have the power in their hands,\" Dos Santos, wearing a dark blue Cuban-style \"guayabera\" shirt, told reporters after voting at a heavily guarded school down the hill from the presidential palace. He left in a fleet of black limousines.</p> <p>The 70-year-old's campaign enjoyed all the usual advantages of incumbency. Luanda is coated in MPLA flags and banners and pictures of Dos Santos, while state media is also loaded in his favour.</p> <p>Marcolino Moco, a former MPLA prime minister who fell out with the president, said: \"The way he is ruling the country, it is not possible to have normal elections because he controls everything: communications, oil, money, people.</p> <p>\"It is worse than the elections in 2008 and even 1992. Today Dos Santos is openly doing these things. The observers are saying everything is OK but my God, everything is not OK.\"</p> <p>One consequence may have been voter apathy. Rafael Marques de Morais, a journalist and anti-corruption activist, said he had visited numerous polling stations on Friday and found them nearly empty. \"I think this time the turnout in Luanda has been extremely low,\" he said. \"The main reason people didn't turn up is that they don't believe in the integrity of the process. They're boycotting the elections.\"</p> <p>There were similar reports from around the country, he added. De Morais also claimed the government had been sending text messages telling people it was safe to go out and vote and that police were closer to polling stations than regulations permitted. He was not aware of any cases of political violence.</p> <p>There was more of a buzz at the polling station in Viana in Luanda but not out of choice. Numerous people complained that they arrived at 7am only to be told by iPad-wielding officials that their names were not registered there. Seven hours later, they were still unable to vote.</p> <p>\"My name came up in another province 300km away,\" said Sentimento Domingos, 33, a street trader. \"I am furious and I am sad because I want to vote. Why do they want to steal our votes?\"</p> <p>Gizela Sebastiao, 30, said: \"I've been here since 7am and haven't found a solution. They are saying I have to go back to Cabinda, nearly 400km away.\"</p> <p>Some suggested the problems were a deliberate ploy to thwart Unita. Goncalves Domingos, 36, a student, said: \"Maybe half the people are not going to vote because they are not on the list. If the election was run the way it's supposed to run, the MPLA would not win. They have engineered it so they can win.\"</p> <p>But elsewhere voters, their fingers dipped in purple ink, reported that the election was better organised than in 2008. Rosa Maria, 37, who voted in Mutamba in central Luanda, said: \"It's a good day for Angola, like a feast. I do believe things are going to change.\"</p> <p>Unita has condemned a lack of transparency, in particular the failure to make a full voters' roll publicly available or to allow its observers into many polling stations. Police arrested several opposition members on Thursday after they tried to enter the electoral commission building to demand credentials to observe.</p> <p>As he watched people voting in orderly fashion in the sunshine, Adalberto Costa, president of administration for Unita, said: \"Some people see this and say it's Africa, this is good enough. We don't think so. We refuse to believe we can't do better.\"</p> <p>Costa claimed Unita publicity material had been torn down in some areas and some supporters had been intimidated. \"If you are in a small village and the chief says only MPLA can remain, it's a big problem.\"</p> <p>Unita intends to dispute the election in court irrespective of the result, he added. \"The MPLA knew the circumstances of this election would not be good for them: too much time in power, people better informed. I'm sure in different conditions, there could have been a change of government. But only one party controls the television and newspapers and, in these circumstances, it's impossible.\"</p> <p>Observers from the Southern African Development Community, the African Union and the Community of Portuguese-Speaking States witnessed the vote. But there were no formal observer missions from the European Union or the United States, both major importers of Angola's oil.</p> <p>Some 9.7 million voters were registered to elect 220 MPs. The MPLA holds 191 national assembly seats after it won 2008 elections in a landslide. Unita won 10% of votes and 16 seats.</p> <p>Dos Santos has never been directly elected and that will not change. Last year the government changed the constitution so that the number one candidate of the winning party in parliament automatically becomes president. Results are expected over the weekend.</p>",
  "<p>Did Mitt Romney pull it off? There's a good case to be made that the Republican convention was a success.

  "<p><strong>(updated below)</strong></p> <p>The Obama administration's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/31/us-cia-detainee-prison-deaths\">aggressive, full-scale whitewashing of the \"war on terror\" crimes</a> committed by Bush officials is now complete. Thursday, Attorney General Eric Holder <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2012/August/12-ag-1067.html\">announced</a> the closing without charges of the only two cases under investigation relating to the US torture program: one that resulted in the 2002 death of an Afghan detainee at a secret CIA prison near Kabul, and the other the 2003 death of an Iraqi citizen while in CIA custody at Abu Ghraib. This decision, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/31/us/holder-rules-out-prosecutions-in-cia-interrogations.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=1\">says the New York Times Friday</a>, \"eliminat[es] the last possibility that any criminal charges will be brought as a result of the brutal interrogations carried out by the CIA\".</p> <p>To see what a farce this is, it is worthwhile briefly to review the timeline of how Obama officials acted to shield Bush torturers from all accountability. During his 2008 campaign for president, Obama <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/attytood/Barack_on_torture.html\">repeatedly vowed</a> that, while he opposed \"partisan witch-hunts\", he would instruct his attorney general to \"immediately review\" the evidence of criminality in these torture programs because \"nobody is above the law.\" Yet, almost immediately after winning the 2008 election, Obama, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/12/us/politics/12inquire.html?pagewanted=all\">before he was even inaugurated</a>, made clear that he was opposed to any such investigations, citing what he called \"a belief that we need to look forward as opposed to looking backwards\".</p> <p>Throughout the first several months of his presidency, his top political aides, such as the <a href=\"http://crooksandliars.com/john-amato/rahm-emanuel-sez-no-bush-officals-shoul\">chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel</a>, and his <a href=\"http://www.talkleft.com/story/2009/4/20/19221/2215\">press secretary, Robert Gibbs</a>, publicly \u2013 and inappropriately \u2013 pressured the justice department to refrain from any criminal investigations. Over and over, they repeated the Orwellian mantra that such investigations were objectionable because \"we must look forward, not backward\". As Gibbs put it in April 2009, when asked to explain Obama's opposition, \"the president is focused on looking forward. That's why.\"</p> <p>On 16 April 2009, Obama himself took the first step in formalizing the full-scale immunity he intended to bestow on all government officials involved even in the most heinous and lethal torture. On that date, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/16/AR2009041602768.html\">he decreed</a> absolute immunity for any official involved in torture provided that it comported with <a href=\"http://digbysblog.blogspot.com.br/2009/07/immunization-program-by-digby-needless.html\">the permission slips</a> produced by Bush department of justice (DOJ) lawyers which authorized certain techniques. \"This is a time for reflection, not retribution,\" the new president so movingly observed in his statement announcing this immunity. Obama added:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[N]othing will be gained by spending our time and energy laying blame for the past \u2026 we must resist the forces that divide us, and instead come together on behalf of our common future.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Note how, in Obama's new formulation, those who believed that Bush officials should be held criminally accountable for their torture crimes \u2013 should be subjected to the rule of law on equal terms with ordinary citizens \u2013 were now scorned as \"the forces that divide us\". On the same day, Holder issued his own statement arguing that \"it would be unfair to prosecute dedicated men and women working to protect America for conduct that was sanctioned in advance by the justice department.\"</p> <p>But at least this limited immunity left open the possibility of prosecuting those agents who went beyond the limits of the DOJ memos in how they tortured: in other words, those \"rogue\" torturers who used brutality and savagery beyond even what was permitted by Bush lawyers. On several occasions, Holder had flamboyantly leaked that he was horrified by what he read in certain case files about detainees who were severely injured by torture or even killed by it \u2013 there were <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2009/06/30/accountability_7/\">more than 100 detainees who died while in US custody</a> \u2013 and that he could not, in good conscience, simply sweep all of that under the rug.</p> <p>As a result, in August 2009, Holder <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/25/nation/na-interrogate-prosecutor25\">announced</a> a formal investigation to determine whether criminal charges should be brought in over 100 cases of severe detainee abuse involving \"off-the-books methods\" such as \"mock execution and threatening a prisoner with a gun and a power drill\", as well as threats that \"prisoners [would be] made to witness the sexual abuse of their relatives.\" But less than two years later, on 30 June 2011, Holder <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jun/30/nation/la-na-cia-interrogations-20110701\">announced</a> that of the more than 100 cases the justice department had reviewed, there would be no charges brought in any of them \u2013 except two.</p> <p>The only exceptions were <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43596191/ns/us_news-security/t/doj-investigate-deaths-detainees-cia-custody/\">two particularly brutal cases</a>, both of which resulted in the death of the detainee. One involved the 2002 abuse of Gul Rahman, who <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/04/06/world/main6368610.shtml\">froze to death</a> in a secret CIA prison in Afghanistan known as the \"Salt Pit\", after he was beaten, stripped, and then shackled to a cement wall in freezing temperatures. </p> <p>The other was the 2003 death of Manadel al-Jamadi at Abu Ghraib, who <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4977986\">died in CIA custody</a> after he was beaten, stripped, had cold water poured on him, and then shackled to the wall. It was al-Jamadi's ice-packed body which was infamously photographed with a smiling US Army Sgt Charles Granier standing over it giving the thumbs-up sign. </p> <p>A US military autopsy declared al-Jamadi's death a homicide due to \"blunt force trauma to the torso complicated by compromised respiration\". Autopsy photos showed \"lacerations and multiple bruises on Jamadi's feet, thighs and arms\", though \"his most significant injuries \u2013 five broken ribs \u2013 are not visible in the photos.\" A physician told NPR back in 2005:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"'How Jamadi was shackled 'makes it very difficult to breathe because you are suspended in a very awkward position. When you combine it with having the hood over your head and having broken ribs, it's fairly clear that this death was caused by asphyxia because he couldn't breathe properly.'\"</p> </blockquote> <p>So, those are the two cases which the DOJ this week announced it was closing without any charges of any kind being brought. Because the Obama administration has systematically blocked all other cases besides these two from any possibility of criminal charges, yesterday's decision means that <em>nobody</em> in the US government will pay any price for the systematic worldwide torture regime which that nation implemented and maintained for close to a decade.</p> <p>This is so despite the <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2008/06/18/41514/general-who-probed-abu-ghraib.html\">findings of General Antonio Taguba</a>, who investigated the torture regime and said that \"there is no longer any doubt as to whether the current administration has committed war crimes\" and \"the only question that remains to be answered is whether those who ordered the use of torture will be held to account.\" And it is done even in the face of <a href=\"http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2009/04/gen_barry_mccaffrey_ret_allege.html\">General Barry McCaffrey's extraordinary observation</a> that:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We tortured people unmercifully. We probably murdered dozens of them during the course of that, both the armed forces and the CIA.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jameel-jaffer\">ACLU's Jameel Jaffer</a> <a href=\"http://ggsidedocs.blogspot.com.br/2012/08/aclu-on-obama-doj-announcement.html\">yesterday said</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"That the justice department will hold no one accountable for the killing of prisoners in CIA custody is nothing short of a scandal \u2026 the decision not to file charges against individuals who tortured prisoners to death is yet another entry in what is already a shameful record.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Beyond the disgust that these events, on their own, should invoke in any decent person, there are two points worth making about all of this which really highlight just how odious all of it is.</p> <p><em>First</em>, Obama has shielded Bush torture crimes not only from criminal prosecution, but any and all forms of accountability. Obama himself <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/24/us/politics/24cong.html\">vigorously opposed and succeeded in killing even a congressional investigation</a> into the torture regime at a time when his party controlled both houses of Congress. </p> <p>Moreover, Obama's top officials, as WikiLeaks cables revealed, secretly worked with GOP operatives to coerce other countries, such as <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2010/12/wikileaks-cable-obama-quashed-torture-investigation\">Spain</a> and <a href=\"http://www.andyworthington.co.uk/2010/12/08/wikileaks-revelations-that-bush-and-obama-put-pressure-on-germany-and-spain-not-to-investigate-us-torture/\">Germany</a>, to quash their investigations into the US torture of their citizens, and <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2009/05/12/obama_101/\">issued extraordinary threats</a> to prevent British courts from disclosing any of what was done. And probably worst of all, the Obama administration aggressively shielded Bush officials <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/09/torture-case-tossed/\">even from being held accountable in civil cases</a> brought by torture victims, by invoking <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/09/08/obama_138/\">radical secrecy powers</a> and <a href=\"http://www.emptywheel.net/2011/07/21/obama-doj-doubles-down-on-presidents-ability-to-detain-us-citizens-with-no-charges/\">immunity doctrines</a> to prevent courts even from hearing those claims.</p> <p>In sum, the Obama administration has been desperate to ensure that there will be no accountability or even that meaningful investigations ever take place. That is almost certainly due to the fact that <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2009/04/24/democrats_24/\">numerous high-level members of Obama's own party</a> were so complicit in these crimes. But at least equally important is this remarkable \u2013 and, it turns out, prescient \u2013 observation from <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/13/washington/13inquire.html\">a New York Times article by Charlie Savage in December 2008</a>, on the prospect of torture investigations aimed at Bush officials:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Because every president eventually leaves office, incoming chief executives have an incentive to quash investigations into their predecessor's tenure.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>In other words, Obama is motivated to shield Bush officials from accountability for their crimes in the hope that once Obama leaves office, he, too, will be gifted identical immunity from the rule of law.</p> <p><em>Second</em>, although government torturers have now been fully protected by Obama from any accountability, those who blow the whistle on such crimes <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/06/obamas-whistleblowers-stuxnet-leaks-drones\">continue to be pursued by the same administration with unprecedented aggression</a>. As Friday's Times article on Holder's announcement pointedly notes:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"While no one has been prosecuted for the harsh interrogations, a former CIA officer who helped hunt members of al-Qaida in Pakistan and later spoke publicly about waterboarding, John C Kiriakou, is awaiting trial on criminal charges that he disclosed to journalists the identity of other CIA officers who participated in the interrogations.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Here, again, we see one of the prime precepts of American justice: high-level official who commit even the most egregious crimes are shielded from all accountability; the only real \"criminals\" are those who speak publicly about those crimes.</p> <p>When Obama first announced his intent to run for president, he vowed that \"the era of Scooter Libby justice \u2026 will be over\" \u2013 meaning high-level officials will no longer be able to break the law with impunity. In mid 2008, Holder <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2009/08/23/will-holder-s-reckoning-on-detainee-abuse-fall-flat.html\">denounced</a> Bush's illegal torture and surveillance programs as showing \"disrespect for the rule of law\", and he vowed:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We owe the American people a reckoning.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>To say those <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/attytood/At_least_not_quite_as_many_people_died_when_Obama_lied.html\">pledges have been radically violated</a> is to understate the case. Far worse, though, is that Obama officials have bolstered the warped precept at the root of so many of America's disasters: that crimes committed by and at the behest of the powerful reside above and beyond the rule of law. In so doing, they have ensured that Bush officials who authorized torture continue to <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/80451.html?hp=l3_b5\">command mainstream respectability</a>, while future leaders tempted to torture again have no reason whatsoever to refrain from doing so. </p> <p>This final act in the sorry spectacle has long been predictable, even inevitable. But that does not make it any less repellent.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p><strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong>: I was on Democracy Now this morning with Amy Goodman discussing Holder's announcement. The seven-minute segment (which also included a discussion of Clint Eastwood's spectacular stream-of-consciousness outburst at the GOP convention last night), can be seen on the player below; a transcript will be <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2012/8/31/glenn_greenwald_on_the_justice_depts\">posted here</a> a bit later in the day:</p>",
  "<p>The MTV movie awards have a prize for the <a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1612085/closer-look-at-movie-awards-best-wtf-moment-nominees.jhtml\" title=\"\">Best WTF Moment</a>; the most bizarre, baffling gobsmacking event. The 2012 winner, and it really is a slam-dunk, is Clint Eastwood, that Hollywood icon, for his frankly bizarre turn at the Republican convention. Halfway into a reasonably genial and sane speech, handing out some regulation whacks at the Democratic incumbent, Clint turned to an empty chair positioned beside him, told us that Mr Obama was sitting in it, and then proceeded to ask him questions and respond to his (imaginary) replies: \"Whaddaya mean 'shut up'?\" Clint rasped. And then: \"I can't do that to myself.\"</p> <p>It wasn't exactly the classiest piece of work. In fact, it made <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsokGIeQFFI\" title=\"\">Kenny Everett's \"Let's bomb Russia!\"</a> speech for the Tories look positively inspired. Clint looked weirdly like some granddad who'd asked to give a speech at the wedding reception and then, to the couple's secret dismay, revealed that he had an extensive comedy routine all worked out. The crowd whooped, but Paul Ryan looked noticeably restrained.</p> <p>What on earth was Eastwood thinking? His knockabout one-side-of-the-conversation turn reminded me of the discipline of greenscreen acting that a new generation of movie stars have to learn, talking to some non-existent CGI monster whose presence will be digitally inserted at some later date. But Clint can hardly have this kind of thing in mind.</p> <p>Clint Eastwood can do comedy. One of his most profitable movies was Every Which Way But Loose (1978), in which his best bud is Clyde, an orangutan he won in a bet. He confides his deepest thoughts about life and women to Clyde, and Clyde is just the wise monkey \u2014 silent. Talking to an orangutan was the one way that Clint could show audiences his adorably goofy side and the box-office was great. Maybe Clint thought that talking to Imaginary Obama would be the same kind of comedy monkey magic. Or maybe he thought that this speech was a non-professional event; he could just dream up some stunt and everyone would love him. Well it was true: they did love him in the room \u2014 sort of \u2014 but out there on television and on the endless, pitiless YouTube repeats, things were different. However he might have felt, Clint did not look lucky.</p>",

(You know, the same law school Mitt Romney attended.) He criticized Obama for driving a \"gas-guzzler\" in front of a room full of people for whom guzzling gas is a minor concern.

Next week, she'll undergo further chemotherapy and, after her blood cells are wiped out, a bone-marrow transplant for which her older sister is the donor. <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-robin-roberts-takes-medical-leave-early-from-good-morning-america-20120830,0,7562062.story\">Thursday was her last day</a>; she was supposed to stay on until Friday, but left a day early to see her ailing mother, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/31/robin-roberts-mother-dies_n_1846100.html?utm_hp_ref=media\">who died only a few hours after Roberts arrived</a> at the family home on the Gulf Coast.</p> <p>As she did after her cancer diagnosis, Roberts has put her own body center stage. She has interviewed her own doctor, brought cameras into her hospital room, worn arm cuffs after intravenous treatments, and once even <a href=\"http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-07-31/news/32966491_1_robin-roberts-mds-myelodysplastic-syndrome\">struggled to speak from a sore jaw</a> that forced her to bow out mid-episode. It's no joke. Both she and ABC have been careful to dampen expectations of a speedy return.</p> <p>Yes, it's easy to criticize the life-affirming tones of daytime television, in which a possibly mortal disease is couched in terms of an \"incredible journey\". It's easy to dismiss the sentimental highlight reels, the appeals to the power of faith, or the mawkish tributes, such as a song by the country star Martina McBride performed on GMA Thursday (sample lyrics: \"Cancer don't discriminate / Or care if you're just 38\"). It's too easy, in fact. The truth is that this sort of sentimentality really does comfort and fortify whole swaths of America. And Roberts, by revealing the trials of cancer and living her recovery in public, is doing something vital.</p> <p>Americans with cancer have often looked to public figures \u2013 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lancearmstrong/status/241510473483317248\">notably Lance Armstrong</a>, whose mythos remains so strong that the majority of his fans have dismissed or ignored his recent exposure as a doping cheat. But most of those celebrities are stoic, triumphant survivors. Disease is a foe that must be piteously vanquished; weakness is defeat, fear is prohibited. Only a very few celebrities have not just survived cancer, but endured all the rigors of illness in the public eye. (One is Kylie Minogue, whose breast cancer led to a huge surge of women signing up for mammograms and performing self-detections in Britain and Australia.)</p> <p>It takes real courage to suffer publicly. And as someone who enjoys the serial intimacy of five-mornings-a-week daytime television, Roberts has an almost unprecedented opportunity to bring the realities of illness and recovery to the public eye. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23TeamRobin\">#TeamRobin</a> was the No 1 trending topic worldwide on Twitter Thursday morning, at something like 500 tweets a minute. Her fans are all wearing colored bracelets with her initials. It is a rare and valuable phenomenon: rather than celebrating an inevitable triumph, millions of people are standing beside an ill woman who will likely recover, but who faces months of grueling treatment.</p> <p>Yet, on Monday, when Roberts announced she'd be leaving GMA, with her co-anchors gripping her hands, she <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/video/robin-roberts-incredible-journey-17086028\">drifted a little from the message of constant uplift</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Forty percent of Americans can't even take a sick day. And here, Disney, ABC News have been phenomenal in their support, and I know that I'm going to have a job when I come back. And just the comfort. And I know that is not the norm. And I am so incredibly grateful.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>\"I am very blessed,\" Roberts admitted. Others might prefer another word: privileged. While Roberts goes off to New York-Presbyterian, one of the best hospitals in the nation, and while Katie Couric and Oprah Winfrey keep her anchor's seat warm, millions of her fans will have no such security. <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/47104777/ns/health-health_care/t/americans-without-health-coveragestudy-finds/#.UD9z0mgSTGI\">A quarter of the United States's working population still has no health insurance</a>, and depending on the outcome of this election, that number might not be going down. The continuing casualization of employment has not only cost people insurance; it's made it impossible to go on medical leave, and put the possibility of treatment beyond the reach of far too many workers.</p> <p>Roberts knows this: she brought it up herself, briefly, and she has never been indifferent to the heavier burdens that most American cancer patients face. On the day she doffed her wig and showed off her nearly bald head, she also put the hairpiece up for auction to raise funds for a charity for the uninsured. (Compare this <a href=\"http://swampland.time.com/2012/08/28/the-ascent-of-ann-romney/?xid=gonewsedit\">with Ann Romney</a>, a survivor of multiple sclerosis, who blithely tells MS sufferers to take medications that start at $3,000 a month and aren't covered even by many health insurance programs, and whose chosen physical therapy is dressage on a horse qualified to participate in the Olympics.) But the kind of discourse that morning TV allows just doesn't have room to consider the big social questions that shape most Americans' bouts with disease.</p> <p>On the couch in Times Square, tears in everyone's eyes, Roberts told us all that she will get through this latest trial with the help of \"faith, friends, and family\". No doubt she will. But most of us need more than that \u2013 we need good cheap healthcare, robust workplace protections, and a whole host of things that no amount of inner strength can provide. Robin Roberts is doing a tremendous service by removing the stigma around serious illness.</p> <p>A greater struggle remains to be waged, and I don't think daytime TV is up for it.</p>",

But that's virtually gurning in comparison with Romney. His resting expression already featuring eyes slightly widened as if by surprise, he seemed able to provide only one facial variation: a double up-flick of the eyebrows for emphasis, sometimes accompanied by a blink.</p> <p>Vocally as well, one size fitted all lines. A phrase summoning up Americans concerned about their \"elderly mom living alone\" clearly called for the throat-choke that a Reagan or Clinton would have brought but Romney sounded as if he were rattling through a list of social housing categories in a dull meeting.</p> <p>As uneasy speakers tend to do, he took the speech too fast and so stumbled and garbled more than even the notoriously inarticulate George W Bush. Obama was accused of having done something to \"Israel under the bus\", but it was unclear what as the verb was swallowed. A line about Americans filling up their cars was also mystifyingly mangled.</p> <p>He was not always well served by the speechwriters. An attempted Reaganesque flight about the \"soles of Neil Armstrong on the moon leaving deep imprints on our souls\" works better written, when the different spellings of can be seen. Verbally, it might come across with a gesture at the feet and then a beating of the breast, but, here, as elsewhere, the candidate remained as parade-straight as the US soldiers his speech strangely never mentioned. The cleverest trick was always using the generic word \"church\" for his faith, with \"Mormon\" occuring only once.</p> <p>Suggesting that Romney's handlers well understand his limitations as a tub-thumper, the speech's best rhetorical flourish was an attack on the flourishes of rhetoric. Whereas Obama had promised to \"slow the rise of the oceans and heal the planet\", Romney's mission was \"to help you and your family.\"</p> <p>That was one sound-bite he avoided chewing up. But, for this speech to work, Republicans will have to hope that Americans really are sick of fancy talkers in the White House.</p>",
  "<p>Between Knobel and Wien, south of the Aeolian Plain, to the west of the ditches of Cerberus, the mighty strata of Mount Sharp rise out of Gale Crater. None of these names have ever been spoken on Mars, where this photograph was taken by Nasa's Curiosity rover before it started its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/aug/28/mars-curiosity-high-resolution-pictures\" title=\"\">slow journey across the landscape</a> this week. They are names given by humans, some in the official language of scientific nomenclature, Latin, others \u2013 like Mount Sharp \u2013 more pet names for vast and remote geographical features.</p> <p>If the first vague images from Curiosity seemed pale beside <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/08/curiosity-rover-mars-nasa-sci-fi\" title=\"\">science fiction fantasies of life on Mars</a>, this high resolution (and colour-adjusted) picture of Mount Sharp is sublime and awe-inspiring. The 18th century writer <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Philosophical_Enquiry_into_the_Origin_of_Our_Ideas_of_the_Sublime_and_Beautiful\" title=\"\">Edmund Burke</a> said the glorious horror of the sublime is evoked in us by phenomena that might threaten our existence. The immense cliffs, screes and gullies of this mountain vista, set in an atmosphere too weak to sustain humans, reveal a landscape of lifeless grandeur that surely inspires such mixed emotions. It is a marvellous place that eerily mirrors the most spectacular sights on earth, from the <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/multimedia/pia16098b.html\" title=\"\">Grand Canyon</a> to the <a href=\"http://servemyworldblog.tumblr.com/image/254001254\" title=\"\">Sahara</a>.</p> <p>It is easy to see from this picture why Nasa has chosen Mount Sharp as a destination for its most sophisticated robot explorer yet. Curiosity's job is to search for evidence that Mars could have once supported life. The exposed strata that can be seen here must contain, like rock strata on earth, a rich geological history of Mars. Evidence of ancient life-supporting conditions <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/index.html\" title=\"\">may be found here if anywhere</a>.</p> <p>Yet \"rich\" may not be the word. How much chance is there of even the tiniest fossil life form being encountered by Curosity? On Earth, the remote ancient rocks of places like the Burgess Shales in Canada contain weird forms such as the early Cambrian creepy-crawly <a href=\"http://www.burgess-shale.bc.ca/\" title=\"\">Hallucigenia</a>. Go for a walk nearly anywhere and you can find fossils of some kind. You don't have to look long, in other words, to find evidence of ancient life in Earth's rocks. Meanwhile in this desolate Martian landscape a machine sent by Earth's most ambitious life forms will pick over the pebbles in search of the merest trace of the possibility of life.</p> <p>This picture is thrilling and it is terrifying. It is a mirror of Earth's rocky architecture if somehow our planet became lifeless.</p> <p>Meanwhile on Earth, Republican presidential hopeful <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/31/mitt-romney-acceptance-speech-hope\" title=\"\">Mitt Romney</a> was making the speech of his life as he launches his bid to run the world's most powerful democracy. \"President Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans and heal the planet\", he said. \"My promise ... is to help you and your family.\"</p> <p>And that's when the scientific magnificence of this photograph turns to dread. While we gaze in wonder at a dead planet, what is happening to the living one? The start of Curiosity's mission has coincided with a summer full of danger warnings for life on earth. Suddenly, debates and pseudo-debates about climate change are ancient history. The <a href=\"http://www.themoscowtimes.com/opinion/article/arctic-melt-will-prompt-energy-rush/467374.html\" title=\"\">record melting of Arctic ice</a> this summer points clearly to ice-free summers in the Arctic in the near future. Nasa itself, not long before its Mars mission touched down, discovered startling satellite evidence of an equally dramatic <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/greenland-melt.htm\" title=\"\">melting of the ice sheet on Greenland</a>. Even <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/jul/29/climate-change-sceptics-change-mind\" title=\"\">former sceptics</a> are accepting the reality and urgency of a change in the life of the Earth caused mainly by human activity.</p> <p>Mars is a beautiful place, as this picture shows, but it is majestically dead. The universe appears to be full of places like that. What no one has so far found much trace of is a place like this: a planet that jumps with life. Earth is a miracle, quite possibly the greatest miracle in the entire cosmos. It is now proven beyond any reasonable doubt that we are playing dangerously with the very fabric of that miracle, endangering the biological balances of our amazing world. Endangering ourselves. In this picture we look on a dead world. Do those silent strata reveal the Martian past, or our future?</p>",

That pause really killed \u2013 too bad you can't put it on a bumper sticker. And that's the problem the Republican party faces writ small (very): they have no affirmative argument, no positive vision. To Obama's cajoling rhetoric, the best they can offer is only a smirking silence.</p> <p>They don't have a script, which brings us to Clint Eastwood. It was another synecdoche for how the GOP has lost its message. They are out-of-touch and winging it, groping for applause lines and settling for cliches. Who would have thought that asking Trump to speak would end up looking like playing it safe? </p> <p>Eastwood's performance was one part painful and two parts befuddling, rescued from a cringe-inducing memory only by the almost-immediate emergence of \"#eastwooding\" on Twitter. People scolding chairs is the new people shaming dogs.</p> <p>Obama even got in on the action, tweeting a faintly unbecoming but pleasantly cheeky photo of himself ensconced in a very-official-looking chair. \"This seat's taken,\" it read. Well, for the moment. Romney's speech previewed a line of argument that \u2013 if the Republicans can hew to it \u2013 is their best shot at wooing swing voters: Obama's not a bad guy, he's in over his head! Give <em>this guy</em> a shot.</p> <p>It's an honest message, at least, if not a very powerful one. There is something small about it, too, and that smallness somehow permeated Romney's address, right down to his disingenuous characterization of Bain Capital as a \"small company\" that \"helped\" other businesses. (With apologies to Ronald Reagan, the nine most terrifying words in the English language are \"I'm from Bain Capital and I'm here to help.\")</p> <p>That's the thing about Romney: he is so rich, his experience so alien to everyday Americans, he has to pretend to be normal and it never works. Though it's all relative; maybe having the old guy talk to a chair wasn't such a bad way to go, after all.</p> <p>The real loser of the night was probably Senator Marco Rubio, who gave a flawless delivery of another personal narrative that does Romney no good by comparison. He is smart, somewhat reasonable (he has kept the Tea Party at arm's distance despite their desire to embrace him), and his very existence proves that the Republican party is not hostage to its nativist fringe.</p> <p>But between Eastwood and Romney, he was just a short interlude of sanity. All things considered with this convention's last night, it might be just as well everyone forgets he was there.</p> <p><em>Ana Marie Cox is US political columnist for the Guardian</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jim-geraghty\">Jim Geraghty</a>: 'Few expected they would hear something so heartfelt'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395478841\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/1/11/1326298456752/jimgeraghty_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Jim Geraghty\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>For long stretches, it looked like Clint Eastwood was going to be the one unmitigated disaster of the convention. His surprise appearance, rumored all week, was somewhat hard to explain just by itself: Romney had rarely sought out help from the relatively rare Hollywood Republicans, and although Eastwood had periodically discussed his Republican preferences, he had never done anything as high-profile as address a national convention before. Eastwood's \"Halftime in America\" ad for Chrysler during the Super Bowl was interpreted by many as a subtle argument in favor of President Obama, so perhaps Eastwood wanted to set the record straight or do penance.</p> <p>Instead, he rambled, scratched his head, spoke away from the microphone, and creeped up to the edge of disaster \u2013 before pulling back with one good line after another: \"the stupid idea of trying terrorists in downtown New York City\"; \"Politicians are employees of ours; and then, the gravelly \"When somebody does not do the job, you've got to let them go.\" If the GOP convention aimed to persuade waivering Obama voters that it's OK to vote for Romney this time, the old tough guy might have.</p> <p>Marco Rubio is consistently a great speaker, with a remarkable personal story, and so those who have seen him speak before may think it was par for the course for him. But those who haven't seen him before are probably asking this morning, \"Who's that guy? He's good! He gets what this country is about!\"</p> <p>And then, there was the nominee himself. For months \u2013 years, really \u2013 his fans have told us that Romney is quite personable, warm, and charming when the cameras are turned off and he's far from the crowds of campaign world. At most, Warm Humanized Mitt has been like Bigfoot: occasional glimpses here and there, secondhand accounts, little or no concrete evidence. Until last night.</p> <p>Suddenly, Thursday night, he's discussing his upbringing, and he mentions:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"My mom and dad were married for 64 years. And if you wondered what their secret was, you could have asked the local florist. [Applause] Because every day, dad gave mom a Rose, which he put on the bedside table. That is how she found that the day my father died. She went looking for him because, that morning, there was no rose.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Romney choked up a bit telling that story, and there were lumps in the throat of everyone watching. We've never seen anything remotely like that from Mitt Romney. Most Americans have never seen Mitt Romney speak anything so personal or heartfelt. It was like a different man.</p> <p>The policy sections were fine, but we know the best convention addresses are rarely about policy proposals; they're about sharing a vision and values. Everyone expected Romney would give a solid speech. But few, if any, expected they would hear something so heartfelt. It will be fascinating to see the reaction in the coming days and weeks.</p> <p><em>Jim Geraghty is a contributing editor to the National Review</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/michael-cohen\">Michael Cohen</a>: 'There just wasn't much there, there'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395478842\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2011/8/6/1312655160523/Michael-Cohen-003.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Cohen\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Cohen Photograph: Observer</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If there was one area of apparent consensus among the journalists assembled in Tampa for the Republican National Convention, it was that Mitt Romney's acceptance speech was the single most important moment of the proceedings. With unfavorable ratings above 50%, and little sense among voters about what a Romney presidency would portend, his remarks on Thursday night were the best opportunity for Romney to change the narrative of the presidential campaign and cast his candidacy in a new and more positive light.</p> <p>That didn't happen. </p> <p>It's not that Romney gave a bad speech; it's that it was a remarkably unmemorable one. It offered more platitudes and bromides rather than lift or vision. Part of the problem is that Romney is not a good public speaker. He gives off an air of smarminess when he speaks and, like another \"robotic\" politician from 12 years ago, exudes the aroma of insincerity.</p> <p>Of course, it doesn't help when he has such unmemorable material from which to work. In fact, it's likely that by the time you are reading this, the one thing everyone will be talking about from Thursday night was Clint Eastwood's bizarre and rambling interlude, with an empty chair serving as a stand-in for Barack Obama.</p> <p>Considering how unpopular Romney is, it was imperative for his acceptance speech to offer a more intimate or absorbing view of him, not as a politician, but as a person. The first two-thirds of the speech sought to do just that, with some middling success. There was, for example, a charming story about the love shared between his parents, George and Lenore. Oddly, however, Romney's only tenure in public service \u2013 as governor of Massachusetts \u2013 went virtually unmentioned. Instead, it was all about his family life, his time at Bain Capital and, interestingly, his faith.</p> <p>But Romney's speechwriters, who were in rather poor form throughout the convention, forget the essential speechwriting trick of showing rather than the telling. They did the opposite, which made the \"humanizing\" section of the speech far less than it could have been. Then again, it might just be that Mitt Romney doesn't have a very interesting personal story, because very little of what he said on Thursday was terribly compelling. So, maybe it's not all the speechwriters' fault.</p> <p>But that section was Gettysburg-esque in comparison to the rest of Romney's remarks. For a guy running against his opponent's economic performance, one would imagine that Romney would take some time to talk his policy agenda for fixing the economy and creating jobs. But one would be wrong. Romney's economic plan, which revolved around an underwhelming set of policy ideas that would do little to spur job creation (trade agreements, school choice, cutting the deficit, boosting small business and energy independence) was remarkably threadbare. There wasn't one single idea for spurring the economy, a la Ronald Reagan's call for a massive tax cut in his 1980 acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention. I counted around 250 words.</p> <p>Foreign policy was even worse: 200 or so words of false attacks against Obama and virtually nothing on what would be the guiding foreign policy principles of a Romney administration. There just wasn't much there, there.</p> <p>In the end, Romney appears to be more interested in critiquing Obama than he is offering voters a sense of where he wants to take the country. In the process he has opened the door for Obama, at his convention next week, to fill the policy vacuum left by Romney's hollow set of remarks. While not necessarily a disaster, it's hard to escape the notion that Romney's speech, like so much of his campaign, was simply a missed opportunity.</p> <p><em>Michael Cohen is a US political columnist for the Observer and Guardian</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jamesantle\">James Antle</a>: 'Humanizing Romney was the central task'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395478843\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/06/02/james_antle_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"James Antle\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The overarching theme of the Republican National Convention tonight: I am a Mitt, not a machine. Humanizing Romney was the central task of the Tampa gathering.</p> <p>So, Thursday, we heard from people who have benefited from Romney's acts of private charity. People whose lives have been touched by his friendship and generosity. This was followed by testimonials from people involved in his successful business ventures, like Staples and Bain, reminding the audience that the former CEO didn't just lay people off. He hired people and created jobs, too.</p> <p>Then Romney himself gave a speech that was focused more on himself than on policy or political issues. He talked movingly about his parents. His wife. His early career. His respect for women and the fact that Ann Romney held a more important job than he did. It was a bit transparent at times that Romney was striving to close the gender gap, or reassure the voter who wants to vote against Barack Obama but isn't quite sure about the Republican nominee.</p> <p>But then, so what if it was transparent? Those were the things Romney needed to do. A majority of the country on some level agrees with Romney's basic critique of Obama: that the economic recovery is too weak, that the jobs are too few, that the president has over-promised and under-delivered. There are voters who were excited about an Obama presidency who now think the orator was greater than the executive.</p> <p>What many of these voters aren't sure about, however, is whether Romney will make things better. They don't know if he is in touch their problems or interests. Obama is the president who hasn't improved their economic condition; Romney is the businessman who fired them. Romney needs to resolve that basic problem in order to win, or he will end up like the last Massachusetts politician on a major party ticket: competitive against a president the country is ready to part with, but not a plausible enough alternative to close the deal.</p> <p>These voters were the target audience of Romney's acceptance speech and all of tonight's programming. Marco Rubio's introduction was designed to energize the conservative base without offending those people. There was a bit of a detour with Clint Eastwood. I liked Eastwood's speech. It was funny, original, and ironic. But I can't say how it will play with television viewers. Some might find it bizarre.</p> <p>Did Romney knock it out of the park? By no means. Much of his speech was workmanlike. He also seemingly left the door open to another war in the Middle East in a foreign policy section the Obama campaign should attack, rather than spending time looking for racially charged dog-whistles. </p> <p>Romney tried to do what he needed to do. It remains to be seen whether he convinced swing voters he was more Mitt than machine.</p> <p><em>James Antle is editor of the Daily Caller News Foundation</em></p>",

The European Union has provided a handful of observers but could not afford the expense of a full mission.</p> <p>Rafael Marques de Morais, a journalist and anti-corruption activist, said there \"is no slight chance\" of a free and fair election, pointing to several irregularities identified in a pre-election audit. \"The whole system is just fraudulent. The national election commission is totally useless. It doesn't have a say. It's just a formality.\"</p> <p>There has also been violence and intimidation in traditional Unita strongholds, he added, pointing to a photo of a Unita supporter attacked by a machete last week. \"His crime? He raised a Unita flag in his village. Fifteen homes were burned and they lost all their belongings. This happens every single day.\"</p> <p>Some 9.7 million voters are registered to elect 220 MPs. The MPLA holds 191 national assembly seats after it won 2008 elections in a landslide. Unita won 10% of votes and 16 seats. Unita is hoping to pick up a bigger share from those who complain about a lack of democracy and inequalities of wealth.</p> <p>Dos Santos, who turned 70 this week, has never been directly elected and that will not change. Last year, the government changed the constitution so that the number one candidate of the winning party in parliament automatically becomes president.</p>",

Under the agreement, Apple is now licensed to use some if not all of Motorola's standard-essential patents in Germany, though the parties have not yet agreed on a FRAND royalty rate, which will ultimately have to be set by German courts unless they agree on a rate prior to its judicial determination.</p> <p> This is a very significant development because it means that Motorola Mobility will have to rely on non-standard-essential patents in its efforts to gain leverage over Apple. It is enforcing one such patent (one that covers push email notifications). With standard-essential patents, it appears that the only thing Google (Motorola) can do now against Apple in Germany is to push for as high a royalty rate as possible, but even in a hypothetical worst-case scenario to Apple, the limit will be the 2.25% rate that Motorola has been demanding for a long time.</p> </blockquote> <p> Spotting that MMI has licensed the standards-essential patents requires a very careful reading of two different filings. Definitely correct, though. It would be useful to know how many of MMI's patents are FRAND, and how many non-FRAND.</p> <p>You can follow <a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:guardiantech\">Guardian Technology's linkbucket on Pinboard</a>.

  "<p>Mitt Romney formally launched his bid to become the next US president with a promise to deliver economic recovery and the hope that he can capitalise on widespread disillusionment with Barack Obama to carry him into the White House.</p> <p>Accepting \"with humility\" the Republican party's nomination to face Obama on 6 November, Romney repeatedly appealed to disappointed voters who had high expectations of Obama on election night in 2008.</p> <p>\"You know there's something wrong with the kind of job he's done as president when the best feeling you had was the day you voted for him,\" Romney said.</p> <p>In a largely pedestrian speech, Romney won some of the loudest applause of the night when he said: \"President Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans and heal the planet.\" After a long pause to milk the raucous laughter of the crowd he delivered his own pledge: \"My promise ... is to help you and your family.\"</p> <p>But overall he failed to rise to the occasion, his flat delivery contrasting badly with the man who introduced him, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who showed rhetorical flair in an assured speech.</p> <p>Romney appeared teary-eyed throughout, unusual for a politician who generally avoids shows of emotion. He was effective when reminiscing about his parents and raising his children, an apparent concession to party strategists who have pressed him to offer glimpses into his family life.</p> <p>He also heeded their advice to confront two of his biggest weaknesses, his Mormon religion and his contentious record at Bain Capital, the investment firm where he made his fortune.</p> <p>But he made no mention of another obstacle lying between him and the White House: his stubborn refusal to release his tax returns beyond the last two years, breaking with custom.</p> <p>While the delegates dutifully cheered as thousands of balloons mixed with confetti fell from the ceiling at the end of the speech, it fell far short of the raucousness and excitement at the end of the 2008 convention. </p> <p>Alex Castellanos, a Republican strategist, said Romney had ticked all the boxes. \"I thought he did a workmanlike job,\" he said.</p> <p>The convention has been patchy, disrupted by hurricane Isaac and lack of enthusiasm for Romney among conservatives, and he must hope that it looked better on television than it sounded in the hall so that it delivers at least a modest bounce in the polls.</p> <p>In what is going to be one of the main Republican themes of the gruelling campaign to come, he contrasted the euphoria that greeted Obama when he won the election on a slogan of hope and change with the sense of disillusionment in America now.</p> <p>\"Hope and change had a powerful appeal,\" he said. \"But tonight I'd ask a simple question: if you felt that excitement when you voted for Barack Obama, shouldn't you feel that way now that he's President Obama?\"</p> <p>In the buildup to the keynote address, the convention listened to a series of tributes from members of his Mormon church, former business colleagues and fellow politicians. </p> <p>But the night was perhaps stolen by the Oscar-winning director and actor Clint Eastwood, who ad-libbed his way through an \"interview\" with an empty chair representing Obama, and spawned his own Twitter trend \u2013 #eastwooding.</p> <p>\"Referring all questions on this to Salvador Dali,\" Obama's campaign spokesman, Ben LaBolt, emailed reporters. Shortly after, Obama <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/241392153148915712/photo/1/large\">tweeted a picture of himself in the president's chair</a> in the White House cabinet room with the caption: \"This seat's taken.\"</p> <p>The heart of Romney's speech was a five-point plan for economic recovery \u2013 that he promised would deliver 12m new jobs within four years. The plan \u2013 deliberately lacking in detail \u2013 covered energy independence, small business, deficit reduction, skills training and international trade, and included the veiled threat of a trade war with China. </p> <p>Romney touched on foreign policy only briefly, pledging to show \"backbone\" to Russian president Vladimir Putin and deriding Obama for failing to halt Iran's nuclear development. But while he praised Obama for ordering the raid that killed Osama bin Laden there was no mention of other international issues, notably Afghanistan, and in the main he focused on attacking Obama's domestic record.</p> <p>\"I wish President Obama had succeeded because I want America to succeed,\" Romney said. \"But his promises gave way to disappointment and division. This isn't something we have to accept. Now is the moment when we can do something. With your help we will do something.\"</p> <p>He promised to repeal Obama's healthcare reform and vowed: \"As president I will protect the sanctity of life. I will honour the institution of marriage. And I will guarantee America's first liberty: the freedom of religion.\"</p> <p>Although the former Massachusetts governor has been out on the road campaigning for months, this has been largely ignored by the vast majority of voters. It is only from this week onwards that most begin to look seriously at the candidates, and Romney badly needs a bounce in the polls from the convention. </p> <p>Now that he has been formally nominated, he can start spending the hundreds of millions of dollars in his general election war chest.</p> <p>Badly trailing Obama in the polls among women, he made a clear pitch to female voters, devoting a large passage to his mother, who ran for the Senate, and the women who had come through the ranks of the Republican party.</p> <p>\"When my mom ran for the senate, my dad was there for her every step of the way. I can still hear her saying in her beautiful voice, 'Why should women have any less say than men about the great decisions facing our nation?'\"</p>",
  "<p>Like the Tin Man heading for the Emerald City, Mitt Romney came to Tampa looking for a heart. It's been a long journey involving a few trips to Damascus as he ditched his moderate record and then to hell and back through the primaries. Thursday night was the final leg. His last chance to introduce himself to an American public that feels it already knows and doesn't particularly like him as a regular multi-millionaire that anyone can relate to. But wizards can perform magic not miracles.</p> <p>Romney didn't blow it. He spoke fluently. The speech was well written. He spoke with conviction. There were some good lines \u2013 one of the more scathing ran like this: \"If you felt that excitement when you voted for Barack Obama, shouldn't you feel that way now that he's President Obama?</p> <p>\"You know there's something wrong with the kind of job he's done as president when the best feeling you had was the day you voted for him.\"</p> <p>He coated his attacks on Obama with a veneer of civility that has been more evident at the convention than in Congress these past few years. Republican senate minority leader Mitch McConnell may have pledged that \"the single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president\". But Romney insisted: \"I wish President Obama had succeeded because I want America to succeed, but his promises gave way to disappointment and division.\"</p> <p>Under the circumstances it was probably the best speech he could have given. And that's the problem. He's still Mitt Romney. He's solid and business-like; deliberate and plodding. He's standing as a CEO and he talks like a CEO. He's more comfortable in front of a PowerPoint than a crowd. There's no crime in that. But when the balloons have been released and the confetti scattered there is not a lot of political mileage in it either. The audience came to its feet out of duty not spontaneity. They would love him to win but they don't love him. They never have.</p> <p>To call it an anti-climax would be to suggest there was a climax somewhere out there poised to visit the convention. There wasn't. And it was not for lack of effort.</p> <p>God knows they tried to build the day around his vulnerabilities. They brought on a couple whom Mr Romney had counselled as their son died when he was a church pastor. \"The true measure of a man is revealed in his actions during times of trouble \u2013 the quiet hospital room of a dying boy, with no camera and no reporters,\" said Ted Oparowsky before the world media. \"This is the time to make that assessment.\"</p> <p>They brought on Olympians to testify to his stewardship of the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake where he \"drew a line in the sand and said the 2002 Games would have highest standard of ethics and integrity\", said Mike Eruzione, captain of the 1980 \"Miracle on Ice\".</p> <p>Earlier in the week Romney's vice-presidential pick, Paul Ryan, joked about his playlist \u2013 but neglected to tell us a single song that was on it \u2013 and his wife, Ann, told us he could make her laugh \u2013 but shared not a single example of how, when or why.</p> <p>Not everything went according to plan. Clint Eastwood had a fictional conversation with an invisible president in an empty chair. Sandwiched between the bizarre (Eastwood) and the boring (Romney) the Florida senator, Marco Rubio, may have shone too brightly.</p> <p>But the last day was the most impressive of three exceptionally dull and flat days. They finished on a high. The problem was they started so low they barely reached sea level by the end. They oiled their tin man as best they could. But at the end of the day \u2013 and it was a long day at the end of a long week \u2013 he's still a tin man.</p> <p>\u2022 This article originally described Marco Rubio as the Florida governor. This has now been changed.</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney will use the biggest speech of his career to urge Americans to put the \"disappointment\" of Barack Obama's last four years behind them and put him in the White House instead.</p> <p>In a speech aimed at tens of thousands of party activists at the Republican convention in Tampa and millions of voters watching at home, he will set out what is to be a major campaign theme for the gruelling months ahead: disillusionment with Obama among those who voted for him in 2008.</p> <p>In excerpts of the speech issued in advance, he said: \"Four years ago, I know that many Americans felt a fresh excitement about the possibilities of a new president. That president was not the choice of our party but Americans always come together after elections. We are a good and generous people who are united by so much more than divides us.\"</p> <p>Americans had voted for \"hope and change\", Obama's 2008 campaign slogan, but instead ended up with disappointment and division, Romney said.</p> <p>In a claim that has to be met with a large degree of scepticism, especially given the barely-hidden glee with which Republicans welcome each new set of poor unemployment statistics, Romney said: \"I wish President Obama had succeeded because I want America to succeed. But his promises gave way to disappointment and division. This isn't something we have to accept. Now is the moment when we can do something. With your help we will do something.\"</p> <p>Romney, who has been actively campaigning for the presidency for the last five years, added: \"So here we stand. Americans have a choice. A decision.\"</p> <p>The speech is potentially a make-or-break moment for Romney. He has been forced on the defensive by the Obama campaign team for months and faced a series of gaffes and unexpected setbacks such as Hurricane Isaac which forced the cancellation of the opening day of the convention.</p> <p>The speech is one of the few remaining opportunities for Romney to break away from Obama, with the two tied in the polls for months. Although the former Massachussetts governor has been out on the road campaigning for months, this has been largely ignored by the vast majority of American voters. It is only from this week onwards that most begin to look seriously at the candidates, and Romney badly needs a bounce in the polls from the convention.</p> <p>Seen by many as an elsuive candidate, the speech is expected to confront what Republicans admit are two of his bigggest weaknesses: his controversial Mormon religion, in which he was a bishop, and his record at Bain Capital, the company where he made his fortune but which was responsible for laying of thousands of American workers.</p> <p>He will also lay out a five-point plan for American recovery \u2013 albeit one that was extremely vague \u2013 which promises to create 12 million new jobs within four years. Another excerpt included a thinly-veiled threat of a trade war with China. \"When nations cheat in trade there will be unmistakable consequences,\" he said.</p> <p>Before the speech, a series of members of the Mormon church are expected to tell the convention about his role as bishop, including two families he helped through hard times.</p> <p>Romney almost never discusses his religion, which is derided by many Christian evangelicals, the bedrock of the Republican party, as a cult. His campaign team hope is that their antagonism towards Mormonism will be overriden by their hostility towards Obama.</p> <p>In another excerpt, he said: \"Like a lot of families in a new place with no family, we found kinship with a wide circle of friends through our church. When we were new to the community it was welcoming and as the years went by, it was a joy to help others who had just moved to town or just joined our church.\"</p> <p>Badly trailing Obama in the polls among women, he will target female voters, devoting a large passage to his mother, who ran for the senate, and the women who had come through the ranks of the Republican party.</p> <p>\"When my mom ran for the senate, my dad was there for her every step of the way. I can still hear her saying in her beautiful voice, 'Why should women have any less say than men, about the great decisions facing our nation?' I wish she could have been here at the convention and heard leaders like governor Mary Fallin, governor Nikki Haley, governor Susana Martinez, senator Kelly Ayotte and secretary of state Condoleezza Rice.</p> <p>\"As governor of Massachusetts, I chose a woman lieutenant-governor, a woman chief of staff, half of my cabinet and senior officials were women, and in business, I mentored and supported great women leaders who went on to run great companies.\"</p> <p>The Oscar-winning director and actor Clint Eastwood, who had earlier endorsed Romney, was expected to make an appearance before Romney delivered the speech.</p> <p>Having formally accepted the Republican presidential nomination, he will hit the campaign trail with running-mate Paul Ryan in Virginia on Friday at the start of of what will be a gruelling two months.</p>"
