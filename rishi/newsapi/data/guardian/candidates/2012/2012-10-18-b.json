  "<p>Barack Obama referred to the death of four Americans in the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi as \"not optimal\" during a taping of the Daily Show, according to the White House pool report.</p> <p>The fallout from the tragic events in Libya, which saw US ambassador Christopher Stevens killed, is already a major campaign theme as Republicans have sought to portray the Obama team as covering up a terrorist attack by blaming the incident on a local mob incited by an anti-Islamic video.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Democrats have accused Republicans of seeking to politicise the deaths of the four Americans and score points in the presidential election. During Tuesday's debate, Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney verbally sparred over the issue in heated exchanges eventually causing the debate moderator, Candy Crowley, to try and step in.</p> <p>Obama used the phrase \"not optimal\" \u2013 which some conservatives quickly sought to portray as a major gaffe \u2013 after Stewart asked about the White House's apparent confusion as to what happened in Libya and who was behind the attack. \"I would say, even you would admit, it was not the optimal response, at least to the American people, as far as all of us being on the same page,\" Stewart said to the president.</p> <p>In response, Obama said: \"Every piece of information that we get, as we got it, we laid it out to the American people. The picture gets fully filled in.\" He then added: \"Here's what I'll say: when four Americans get killed, it's not optimal. We're going to fix it. All of it.\"</p> <p>Obama has been a frequent visitor on the Daily Show. This last taping was his sixth visit overall since 2005 and his second since taking office as president.</p> <p>During the interview, Stewart's questions ranged over his usual terrain of the trivial and the funny to serious policy issues. Obama admitted that he had an \"off night\" during the first presidential debate in Denver, when he turned in a performance that was widely panned, including by Stewart on his show.</p> <p>He also said that he still wanted to close the controversial prison camp at Guant\u00e1namo Bay: a 2008 campaign promise that remains unfulfilled. \"I still want to close Guant\u00e1namo. We haven't been able to get that through Congress \u2026 one of the things we have to do is put a legal architecture in place, and we need congressional help to do that,\" he said. On a lighter note, Obama also joked with Stewart about the steamy literary hit Fifty Shades of Gray.</p> <p>Stewart also told the president that he was was making a campaign scrapbook, and showed Obama two photographs from the debate. One showed first lady Michelle Obama looking at him angrily onstage after a debate, and the other showed her smiling broadly at him afterward. \"Do you know which debate was which?\" Stewart asked. \"Cute. Cute, Jon,\" Obama replied.</p>",
  "<p>On Tuesday night, the presidential candidates got so rough with each other that hot potato Tagg Romney <a href=\"http://billlumaye.blogspot.com/2012/10/tagg-romney-drops-by-bill-show.html?spref=fb\">wanted to punch the president,</a> to protect his dad's honor. On Thursday night, the candidates will conceal their mutual disdain and take turns telling jokes from a shared podium.</p> <p>It's time for the Al Smith dinner, the white-tie Manhattan ritual that drops like an Alka Seltzer every four years, as the race for the White House enters a stage of maximum partisan discomfort. Hosted by the archbishop of New York, the dinner promotes itself as a light-hearted break from the campaign trail. In fact it's a duty to which presidential nominees have docilely submitted since 1960, except when the whiff of controversy, usually over abortion, has made it politically inconvenient for the Catholic Church to invite them.</p> <p>This year Archbishop Timothy Dolan has given notice, <a href=\"http://blog.archny.org/index.php/al-smith-dinner/\">in a blog post</a>, of his intention to follow \"the example of Jesus, who was blistered by his critics for dining with those some considered sinners\". The cardinal has received \"stacks of mail\" urging him to have nothing to do with President Obama. The president has been invited nonetheless.</p> <p>Will the president and the governor manage to rinse themselves of partisan rancor long enough to crack up the attending guests, a mix of the political and media elite? Will they refrain from interrupting each other? Will Candy Crowley be there?</p> <p>The conventional wisdom here would place Romney, who was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TeresaKopec/statuses/258429219233734656?tw_i=258429219233734656&amp;tw_e=details&amp;tw_p=tweetembed\">visibly enraged</a> during Tuesday's debate, well outside his comfort zone. His efforts at spontaneous humor on the campaign trail <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/02/27/1068682/-Mitt-Romney-is-not-impressed-with-the-fancy-raincoats-worn-by-Nascar-fans\">routinely land as insults</a>. His written jokes aren't much better. His laugh is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgLzMyrv2xM\">as natural as Deet</a>.</p> <p>But close observers say Romney is actually the funnier of the two candidates. The Atlantic correspondent Molly Ball has written that the Republican <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/03/mitt-romneys-humor-an-appreciation/254282/\">\"has the most sophisticated \u2013 and underappreciated \u2013 sense of humor of any presidential candidate\",</a> and he wasn't bad <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQAXqsjO_CQ&amp;feature=player_embedded\">when he delivered the Top Ten list on Letterman</a> (No1: \"Oprah is my half-sister\"). </p> <p>The dinner is an extra-starch event with a low risk of anything unscripted happening. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym6m9DL_8Mg&amp;feature=player_embedded#!\">And Romney has a ton of practice at these kinds of things.<br></a></p> <p>As for the president, he's had plenty of practice of his own, including at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cen37qxA7E\">the 2008 Al Smith dinner</a>, when he appeared opposite John McCain. </p> <p>\"I feel right at home here,\" Obama said then, \"because it's often been said that I share the politics of Alfred E Smith and the ears of Alfred E Neuman.\" He went on to make a joke about Greek columns. This year he has a bunch of great material to draw on; he can joke about how his failure in the first debate resulted in a seven-point Gallup deficit with 19 days to go. Stuff writes itself.</p> <p>The rest of the world gets to find out what happened inside the Al Smith dinner when the video is released. It should be hilarious \u2013 as long as Tagg isn't invited.</p>",

  "<p>A freshly aired audio recording in which Mitt Romney asks business owners to talk with employees about the upcoming election sounds at first like a throwback to the bad old days of voter clientelism. That's the term academics use for the time-honored American practice of trading something nice for political support.</p> <p>Voters used to be able to get a shot of whiskey or a pair of boots. Now, in the era of expanding corporate rights, you might just get a half-promise not to be fired \u2013 as long as you vote the right way.</p> <p>Romney was speaking on a conference call that was sponsored by the <a href=\"http://www.nfib.com/advocacy/item?cmsid=58241\">National Federation of Independent Businesses</a>, as part of a series that had previously featured Newt Gingrich, Rick Perry and Michele Bachmann. He had been talking about why Barack Obama is bad for business. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuMHuVlIW0&amp;feature=player_embedded#t=26m44s\">Then he encouraged employers to \"make it very clear to your employees\" how they feel about the presidential race</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I hope you make it very clear to your employees what you believe is in the best interest of your enterprise and therefore their job and their future in the upcoming elections. And whether you agree with me or you agree with President Obama, or whatever your political view, I hope \u2014 I hope you pass those along to your employees. Nothing illegal about you talking to your employees about what you believe is best for the business, because I think that will figure into their election decision, their voting decision and of course doing that with your family and your kids as well.</p> </blockquote> <p>The recording, which was first spied by <a href=\"http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/14017/koch_industries_sends_45000_employees_pro_romney_mailing/\">In These Times</a>, has generated consternation on the left. It came to light in the same week that Mike Elk of In These Times reported that <a href=\"http://www.inthesetimes.com/Koch/KOCH1.pdf\">the Koch brothers, David and Charles, had sent 45,000 employees packets containing actual lists of candidates supported by Koch Industries</a>. At the top of the list of approved candidates was Mitt Romney.</p> <p>Is it legal to do this? On the conference call, Romney went out of his way to say that it is, when he said: \"Nothing illegal about you talking to your employees...\" </p> <p>Romney has drawn a similar distinction in describing his strategy for paying taxes, saying: \"I pay all the taxes that are legally required and not a dollar more.\" In Romneyland, legal compliance is a lofty moral paradigm.</p> <p>Romney also happens to be right: bosses can talk to employees about whom to vote for. Corporations can send political mailings to employees. And since the 2010 Citizens United Supreme Court decision, corporations appear to have new freedom to force employees to attend political events like the Romney rally in Beallsville, Ohio, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0912/81421.html\">in which coal miners were forced to appear as campaign props</a>.</p> <p>Citizen United's generous interpretation of corporate speech means that employers \"may now be able to compel their employees to listen to their political views at [workplace] meetings on pain of termination,\" <a href=\"http://yalelawjournal.org/the-yale-law-journal-pocket-part/volume-120/addressing-political-captive-audience-workplace-meetings-in-the-post%11citizens-united-environment/\">wrote Paul Secunda, an associate law professor at Marquette University, in the Yale Law Journal</a>. \"Although federal law does still prevent employers from issuing explicit or implicit threats against employees who vote for the 'wrong' candidate, short of that, nothing prohibits employers from requiring employees to participate in one-sided political propaganda events.\"</p> <p>Employees have little real-life protection from aggressive attempts by employers to sway their votes, Secunda said in a phone interview Thursday.</p> <p>\"Workers are facing a constant stream of political pressure, 16 hours a day, a stream of literature,\" he said. \"This stuff has always taken place, especially in the blue-collar workplace. It's generally legal.\"</p> <p>The federal voter intimidation statute, which makes it illegal to \"intimidate, threaten, or coerce\" voters, is rarely called on to protect workers, he said.</p> <p>\"The devil's in the details,\" Secunda said. \"What does it mean to 'intimidate' as far as preventing the right to vote? An express type of threat? Some of these more implicit types of power dynamics don't explicitly meet this high standard.\"</p> <p>Some states have their own voter intimidation laws, Secunda said, but a paucity of relevant case law indicates a low level of enforcement.</p> <p>\"Employers are pretty much able to do what they want as far as putting pressure on employees to vote against a certain candidate,\" he said.</p> <p>Secunda said a new \"Federal Worker Freedom Act\" was needed, to prohibit employers from engaging in mandatory political indoctrination. A new law could comply with Citizen United's broad interpretation of corporate speech, he said.</p> <p>\"The focus is not on employers' speech,\" Secunda said. \"You can't interfere with that. The focus would be on regulating employer conduct.\"</p>",
  "<p>Senior Labour party figures are urgently discussing whether to match David Cameron's expected promise to hold a referendum in the next parliament on renegotiated British terms for EU membership.</p> <p>Cameron is due to make the commitment in a landmark speech by Christmas and Labour will face pressure to say if it will do the same.</p> <p>One senior Labour figure said any such commitment now \"would split the party\", adding it was better for Labour to argue in the short term that the chief priority for Europe was to sort out a system of governance inside the eurozone that worked, and that boosted growth in Britain's chief export markets. Demands now for a renegotiated relationship into those already fraught discussions might backfire, senior party figures said. In the short term Labour should hold fire on its position pending the 2015 manifesto.</p> <p>But the former Labour Europe minister, Denis MacShane, urged the party to state now that it would hold a referendum if Labour formed a government after 2015.</p> <p>He said: \"Labour should offer a referendum after 2015 but make clear we will not isolate Britain from Europe in the meantime and we will campaign for Britain to stay in the EU.</p> <p>\"All David Cameron has done is send himself naked into every EU conference chamber between now and the next election.\"</p> <p>Cameron's stated position is that he wants Britain to remain in the EU, but on new terms and in a more disengaged manner. A Foreign Office-led review of the balance of competencies is under way and will form the basis of British demands to the EU likely to be put around the time of the next election.</p> <p>As the 17 countries of the eurozone are forced to pool more powers in response to the single currency crisis, the idea is that the Lisbon treaty will need to be renegotiated to facilitate the kind of changes being pursued.</p> <p>That would supply Cameron with the opportunity to try to redefine Britain's place in the EU, agreeing to allow greater integration for those who want it in return for being able to \"repatriate\" areas of policy-making from Brussels.</p> <p>The Cameron strategy, as seen from Brussels, is fraught with risk and uncertainty. It is not at all clear that the Lisbon treaty will be renegotiated. In an interview with the Guardian, the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, bluntly opposed the notion since it could necessitate a referendum in France. Hollande, who strongly backed a Yes vote in the French referendum on a new EU constitution in 2005, was dealt a blow by France's rejection and is keen to avoid any repeat.</p> <p>The Germans have been the strongest advocates of treaty change and renegotiation. A senior official said on Wednesday that Berlin felt it would be clear by December that the Lisbon treaty would need to be reopened.</p> <p>However, there are moves to try to retool and reshape the eurozone while avoiding a renegotiation. Many in Brussels fear renegotiation would open a can of worms.</p> <p>Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, told Cameron this week that she was not in any hurry to renegotiate the treat, according to senior EU diplomats who say her call is a tactical device aimed at securing her eurozone policy aims in a battle with the French.</p> <p>They are confident Berlin would back off on its demands if its aims could be achieved by different means.</p> <p>There is criticism of Cameron that if he tries to cherrypick the EU bits that suit him and ditch the rest, others will be encouraged to follow suit, inviting a chaotic and damaging free-for-all.</p> <p>Hollande hinted in his interview that he would prevent this from happening. While he accepted that Britain would not join the euro and was generally \"in retreat\" over Europe, he said: \"The British are tied by the accords they have signed up to. They can't detach themselves from them.\"</p>",

  "<p>France and Germany were locked in their worst showdown of the three-year euro crisis on Thursday evening, split between two conflicting approaches, with Berlin leading the charge for draconian new centralised powers over national budgets and Paris spearheading a campaign for quicker and easier bailouts of struggling countries and banks.</p> <p>French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, appearing at only his third EU summit in Brussels after having thrown down the gauntlet to Angela Merkel this week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/francois-hollande-interview-eu-france?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">in an interview with the Guardian</a> and other European newspapers, flatly dismissed German demands for a new European \"budgets tsar\" who would be able to overrule national governments and parliaments on tax-and-spend policies in the eurozone.</p> <p>\"The topic of this summit is not the fiscal union but the banking union, so the only decision that will be taken is to set up a banking union by the end of the year and especially the banking supervision,\" Hollande said. \"Merkel has her own deadline, in September 2013,\" he added caustically, referring to next year's general election in which the German leader is seeking a third term.</p> <p>The two leaders met before the summit began on Thursday to try to iron out their differences. They were seen walking together grim-faced into the summit room, with Hollande speaking to Merkel and the chancellor appearing to say 'no' three times.</p> <p>The summit sought to come up with an agreement on putting the European Central Bank in charge of supervising the eurozone banking sector by the start of next year, Hollande's key demand.</p> <p>Germany, which is dragging its feet on the banking supervisor despite having proposed the move in June, revived calls for an independent European budgets tsar based at the European Commission who would enjoy sweeping powers of enforcing fiscal rectitude by overruling national governments' and parliaments' budgetary policies.</p> <p>\"We are of the opinion, and I speak for the whole German government on this, that we could go a step further by giving Europe real rights of intervention in national budgets,\" Merkel told parliament in Berlin before arriving in Brussels.</p> <p>The draft summit conclusions stipulated the aim of launching the banking supervisor in January next year, but Merkel was said to be trying to get that deadline altered or removed. \"Quality must come before speed,\" she said. \"There are a lot of very complicated legal questions.\"</p> <p>Senior diplomats described the stand-off between France and Germany as substantive, but also entailing \"a lot of smoke and mirrors\", with both sides engaged in setting out strong positions before having to climb down at a later stage.</p> <p>In the Guardian interview this week Hollande lambasted Merkel's crisis management over the past 30 months, arguing that the German fixation on austerity and debt reduction was making matters worse in the eurozone by triggering recession.</p> <p>He is known to believe that Merkel is not listening to him, nor to the leaders of Spain or Italy. His clarion call is the need for greater \"solidarity\" in the eurozone.</p> <p>\"The Germans are telling the others that if you want solidarity, then this is the price you have to pay, we take control of your budget through a super-commissioner,\" said a senior EU diplomat. \"The Germans are playing hardball. But the French and the Germans will have to do a deal. And they always do. Otherwise [the euro] collapses.\"</p> <p>No breakthrough or deal was expected at the summit, though, because the leaders feel that the pressure from the financial markets on the euro and on borrowing costs for countries like Spain and Italy has lifted.</p> <p>Herman Van Rompuy, the European Council president chairing the summit, hoped to finesse an overall agreement on the banking supervisor. But the new system is highly technical and complex. Even if the leaders reached an outline deal on the project, it will take months at least to iron out the detail, making it unlikely that the regime will be up and running by January as planned.</p> <p>The summit also \"explored\" two new proposals from Van Rompuy aimed at stabilising the euro \u2014 a system of annual \"contracts\" struck between eurozone governments and the European Commission committing governments to reforms of their labour markets and other structural changes, as well as the establishment of a new eurozone \"budget\" that would be used to cushion the impact of the structural reforms and also as a redistribution mechanism within the single currency area.</p> <p>The eurozone budget idea is contested, albeit still vague. The notion originates from Berlin which sees it as a way to deflect pressure for a more comprehensive system of \"eurobonds\", pooling the debt of the eurozone countries.</p> <p>Despite conflicting pressures on Spain over whether to request a bailout, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who has an election in his native area of Galicia on Sunday, was not expected to ask for help. Behind the scenes the French-led camp is urging him to take a bailout, while the Germans are pushing him to resist because Merkel hopes to avoid taking the request to her parliament less than a year before seeking re-election.</p> <p>Hollande is also insisting that the eurozone spell out the terms involved in a Spanish bailout before any request is tabled, while the Germans stick to the line that the request must come first and then the conditions negotiated.</p> <p>Diplomats expect Spain to ask for a rescue before the end of the year and predict that the negotiations over it will be the toughest by far in the three-year euro and sovereign debt crisis.</p>",
  "<p>Rwanda's election to the UN security council on Thursday was branded a major embarrassment in the wake of a UN report claiming that the country is fuelling a violent uprising in a neighbouring country.</p> <p>Rwanda was unopposed in its bid for a non-permanent African seat on the security council \u2013 previously held by South Africa.</p> <p>The timing of Rwanda's ascent could hardly be more uncomfortable for the UN security council, whose own group of experts have produced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/rwanda-minister-leader-congo-rebels-kabarebe\" title=\"\">a damning report</a> of its support for the rebel M23 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).</p> <p>Atoki Ileka, Congo's ambassador to France and former envoy to the UN, said: \"It is a dreadful day and a very sad day for Africa because the security council is the UN body in charge of peace and security, and this is a country not committed to peace and security. It's very embarrassing for the UN.\"</p> <p>Ileka remained hopeful, however, that the security council would \"rubber stamp\" the group of experts' final report before Rwanda takes its seat. The report is due to be presented next month whereas Rwanda will not become a member until 1 January 2013.</p> <p>From this date onward, however, there is the prospect of division and deadlock. The Congolese government is demanding that the security council impose targeted sanctions against Rwandan and Ugandan officials named in the UN experts' report.</p> <p>An unnamed western diplomat told Reuters that getting unanimity among the 15 council members on Congo's rebellion would be difficult with Rwanda in the room.</p> <p>Carina Tertsakian, senior researcher on Rwanda for Human Rights Watch, said before Rwanda's election that its membership would present \"a clear conflict of interest\", saying the country had \"for several years undermined initiatives of the security council, for example the arms embargo on Congo\".</p> <p>She added: \"Our fear is that having a seat on the security council will enable Rwanda to protect its own officials from sanctions. For the victims \u2013 Congolese or Rwandan \u2013 of violent abuses by M23, this is a real affront.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/rwanda-minister-leader-congo-rebels-kabarebe\" title=\"\">An extract of the UN report</a> leaked to Reuters this week named the Rwandan defence minister general, James Kabarebe, a close ally of President Paul Kagame, as effectively commanding the rebellion. It also accused both Rwanda and Uganda of providing weapons, troops and military and political aid to the M23 rebels in their six-month fight against Congolese government troops.</p> <p>The report has also intensified pressure on Britain to review its decision to restore \u00a316m of aid to Kagame's government.</p> <p>Rwanda accused the head of the group of experts of \"pursuing a political agenda\". Uganda called the allegations \"rubbish, rubbish, rubbish\".</p> <p>Five security council seats were due to be filled in elections on Thursday. There are five veto-holding permanent members of the council \u2013 the US, Britain, France, Russia and China \u2013 and 10 temporary members without vetoes.</p> <p>Rwandan UN diplomat Olivier Nduhungirehe had said his country was not worried about the report harming its security council bid. \"The members of the general assembly know exactly what our record is and they cannot be deterred or swayed by a baseless report, which has no credibility,\" he told Reuters.</p> <p>\"We are the sixth [biggest] troop-contributing country for peacekeeping, we are a leading country in achieving the Millennium Development Goals, we have a record in post-conflict reconstruction and peace-building.\"</p> <p>After the UN vote a defiant if somewhat incoherent message was posted on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulKagame\" title=\"\">Kagame's Twitter account</a>. \"No matter what haters say dO-alwz justice&amp;truth willprevail!!!\" it said. \"Sometimes it just requires a bit of good fight for allthat..!!! # UN VoTe\"</p> <p>Rwanda was last on the council in 1994-95, a period that coincided with the genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus.</p>",
  "<p>The president, Hamid Karzai, has said he will not accept foreigners on a key election watchdog, a move that risks undermining the credibility of a presidential poll in 2014.</p> <p>Karzai also said Afghans would not be willing to grant foreign troops immunity from prosecution while the country was at war, a position that could jeopardise plans for a long-term foreign military presence in the country.</p> <p>\"The presence of foreigners in the Electoral Complaints Commission [ECC] is against the sovereignty of Afghanistan,\" Karzai said at a news conference in Kabul with the visiting Nato chief, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, according to Reuters.</p> <p>The 2014 election coincides with the departure of Nato-led troops from Afghanistan, and is expected to lay the foundation for the country's future without the coalition or Karzai, who has ruled for a decade and cannot stand for the top office again under Afghan law.</p> <p>There are already concerns about the potential for fraud, after widespread corruption marred votes in 2009 and 2010. Rights groups warned that the ECC would be weakened by the loss of members best able to ignore internal political pressure.</p> <p>\"In the 2009-2010 elections the ECC was the only entity that was involved in the whole process who came out looking good \u2026 and that seemed to be due in no small part to the fact that they had internationals involved who didn't have a dog in the fight,\" said Heather Barr, Afghanistan researcher for Human Rights Watch. \"So it's really concerning to see that particular institution changed and possibly made less immune to external influence in the runup to what is going to be a very critical election.\"</p> <p>Karzai's spokesman Aimal Faizi said foreigners were still welcome as election monitors, but that the Afghan government was able to ensure the poll was fair.</p> <p>Rasmussen and Karzai also discussed a role for foreign troops after 2014. \"This will not be a combat mission. It will focus on training, advice and assistance. And we are actively planning for that mission\", Rasmussen said.</p> <p>The US and Afghanistan are involved in sensitive negotiations about the shape of a long-term military presence, expected to lay the groundwork for similar deals with other Nato countries. The most challenging detail is expected to be the legal status of US forces; the Iraqi government's refusal to grant immunity precipitated the final pullout of US troops there last year. Karzai said Afghans would not tolerate such protections either, unless the country became more secure.</p> <p>\"If Afghanistan is stable and peaceful, the Afghan people will not have much problem with immunity but if Afghanistan is not peaceful or continues to be in a state of war, the Afghan people will not see the benefit of partnership for them,\" Faizi said. \"Once they have security and peace they will agree with the issue of immunity and it will be easier for the president to go to the people and ask for immunity.\" <strong> </strong></p>",
  "<p>Dilma Rousseff may be one of Brazil's most popular presidents ever but even she knows better than to challenge the prime-time power of the TV phenomenon known as Avenida Brasil.</p> <p>Rousseff, who enjoys a 62% approval rating, postponed a rally to endorse her party's candidate in a S\u00e3o Paulo mayoral race on Friday because it would coincide with the finale of the telenovela.</p> <p>The last episode of <a href=\"http://tvg.globo.com/novelas/avenida-brasil/index.html\" title=\"\">Avenida Brasil</a> is tipped to be a 70-minute storm of melodrama that includes a polygamous wedding, a celebratory feast and the answer to the question on tens of millions of Brazilian lips: \"Who killed Max?\"</p> <p>Against such competition, presidential aides feared the rally would fall flat: even hardcore politicos are likely to stay at home to see the mystery solved.</p> <p>Several newspapers pointed out that Rousseff is a fan of the show \u2013 which has been running up to six days a week since March \u2013 and may simply have wanted to be among the 50% of the viewing public expected to tune in for the climax.</p> <p>It makes political sense for the president to tune into Avenida Brasil's audience, which has come to epitomise the rise of a formerly poor social group that is now in the most powerful consumer stratum in the country.</p> <p>Brazil's \"C-class\" \u2013 as they are categorised \u2013 have grown rapidly in size and influence over the past decade thanks to the growth of the Brazilian economy, widening credit lines and the government's efforts to address income inequality.</p> <p>Since 2004, the government says, 32 million Brazilians have been lifted out of poverty. Last year, this helped the C-class \u2013 defined as those earning between 1,000 and 4,500 reals (\u00a3300-\u00a31,400) a month \u2013 to constitute for the first time a majority of Brazil's population of 196 million.</p> <p>Ten years ago, they needed every penny to meet their bills. Today they have enough disposable income to buy mobile phones, laptops and motorbikes. According to a study commissioned by the president's office, the C-class accounts for 76% of supermarket sales and 60% of visits to hairdressing salons.</p> <p>With this group increasingly beloved by advertisers, TV producers at Rede Globo \u2013 the channel that dominates the \"telenovela\" industry \u2013 are angling more shows and lucrative product placement opportunities in their direction.</p> <p>Few more so than Avenida Brasil, which is named after a busy road in Rio de Janeiro that leads from rundown suburban communities and <em>favela</em> shanty towns into the smart city centre.</p> <p>Dating back to 1951, telenovelas have long been a feature of Brazilian life and often mix plots from different classes and a range of controversial issues. But rarely has a prime-time drama pushed more C-class buttons.</p> <p>This is evident in <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/41310400\" title=\"\">the opening credits, set over a <em>baile charme</em> dance track and images of a pulsating nightclub</a>, and the bling-bedecked cast of characters \u2013 a cuckolded footballer, the owner of a manicure parlour and the sparsely clad <em>piriguete</em> party girl, Suelen.</p> <p>Mariana Zylberkan, a columnist for Veja magazine, says the show represents a shift from the plush restaurants and bossa nova rhythms of upmarket Rio to the barbecues and techno of the C-class.</p> <p>\"The profile of the characters is unprecedented among the telenovelas of the past 10 years,\" she writes, calculating that 79% belong to the \"new middle class\".</p> <p>Marieta Pinheiro de Carvalho, a history lecturer at the University of Rio de Janeiro, said the focus on C-class was becoming a trend.</p> <p>\"In previous novelas, there was too much value placed on the richest class. What is happening now is a classical part of the civilising process: groups that didn't have much power in the past now have more economic and social influence so they are contesting a greater public space.\"</p> <p>Reflecting the optimism and the lingering vulnerability of the formerly poor, the plot features spectacular social rises and falls when match-deciding penalties are missed, wrongdoing is exposed and love affairs succeed or go awry.</p> <p>At least two of the lead characters are raised in rubbish dumps. One plots revenge. The other, Max, has been murdered. The culprit is the source of as much speculation this week as \"Who shot JR?\" at the 1980s peak of in the US soap Dallas \u2013 or the mystery over the killing of Dirty Den in EastEnders in the UK.</p> <p>But there are distinct differences between British soap operas and Brazilian telenovelas, which tend to run in more intense bursts \u2013 every weekday over a roughly eight-month period, ending with a spectacular finale.</p> <p>This is not that first time that a telenovela has overshadowed politics. In 1993, the impeachment of president Fernando Collor de Mello was pushed off the front pages by the real-life murder of soap opera star Daniella Perez, by the actor who was playing her jealous boyfriend in De Corpo e Alma (Of Body and Soul).</p> <p>The genre was recently thought to have been in terminal decline as audiences switched from hackneyed storylines to cable TV and the internet, while rivals in Mexico, Venezuela and even South Korea competed in the wider Latin American market. But slicker HBO-like cinematography and a new generation of scriptwriters \u2013 such as Jo\u00e3o Emanuel Carneiro, who wrote Avenida \u2013 have revitalised the telenovela by appealing to the young and the C-class.</p> <p>As Avenida Brasil approaches its finale with another murder, a marriage proposal and the creepy rantings of the father of the suddenly sympathetic villain Carminha, the ratings are creeping closer to the 50% level, which has rarely been seen since the 1990s. The last episode is expected to surpass that.</p> <p>The outcome is, of course, secret. But showbiz websites predict it will wrap up with a solution to Max's murder, the wedding of the lead characters, and a huge party to mark the opening of a shopping mall in Divino \u2013 a perfect happy ending for the advertisers who adore the new consumer class.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Carolina Massote</em></p>",
  "<h2>Ha-Joon Chang: Further unrest will stall recovery</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397996165\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/4/30/1272628800898/Ha-Joon_Chang.jpg\" alt=\"Ha-Joon Chang\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Fran\u00e7ois Hollande says the worst is over for the eurozone crisis, but I don't agree, for two reasons. First, while the European Central Bank (ECB) has recently done things to calm the financial market for the moment, it is not clear whether it will be able to repeat this act if the world economic situation gets worse \u2013 the Chinese economy is slowing down and the US may experience a double-dip recession if Mitt Romney wins and lets Paul Ryan loose on the budget.</p> <p>Second, even if there is no further austerity for Greece and other \"periphery\" countries (as Hollande promises), the swingeing cuts that have already been made to the social spending in those countries are overwhelming. Many people in those countries have stretched themselves to the limit to cope with the cuts, but they cannot continue to do so for much longer, especially in the face of high unemployment. When they decide that they have had enough, there will be further social unrest, which will stall the recovery, as long-term investors, whom Europe needs for a genuine recovery, need a stable environment.</p> <p>\u2022 Ha-Joon Chang teaches economics at Cambridge University</p> <h2>Alistair Darling: Three steps are necessary</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397996166\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/5/13/1242216271646/Alistair-Darling-MP-001.jpg\" alt=\"Alistair Darling MP\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alistair Darling MP Photograph: Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I agree with President Hollande that recession is as big a threat as debt. I wish I could agree that Europe is near to the end of the crises. The eurozone will probably not break up but that is because of politics rather than economics.</p> <p>For recovery, three steps are necessary:</p> <p>First \u2013 the eurozone banks need to be properly capitalised and toxic debts dealt with. Spain needs to do this urgently. A credible timetable for the banking union needs to be put in place, although that will have implications for the UK.</p> <p>Second \u2013 a credible solution to the Greek problems needs to be put in place.</p> <p>Third \u2013 I agree that austerity on its own will never work. What is needed is a credible plan for growth and deficit reduction.</p> <p>The ECB has bought time. The eurozone leaders needs to agree a credible plan.</p> <p>\u2022 Alistair Darling was chancellor of the exchequer from 2007 to 2010</p> <h2>Costas Lapavitsas: The ECB can provide liquidity, but not solvency</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397996167\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/9/23/1316775554457/costas.jpg\" alt=\"Costas Lapavitsas\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This misleading impression has been created by Mario Draghi of the ECB, who announced that he will lend freely to countries in trouble, driving interest rates down. There has already been virulent opposition, led by the Bundesbank. For conservative German opinion, Draghi is the devil in Goethe's Faust, luring Angela Merkel into a deadly pact of inflation. Also, for ECB lending to materialise, a country must first accept tough austerity conditions. Which European politician will do that?</p> <p>Above all, the ECB can provide liquidity, but can do nothing about the solvency of states. The eurozone periphery is effectively bankrupt, and the EU policy of austerity is making things worse, especially in Greece. The economy has collapsed, public debt will soon need another major haircut; there are huge human costs and explosive social conditions. If the crisis is even to approach resolution, austerity must be lifted and investment funds directed to the periphery. As there is no prospect of that, 2013 will probably be even worse.</p> <p>\u2022 Costas Lapavitsas is professor of economics at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London</p> <h2>Phillip Inman: Optimism set against a gamble</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397996168\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/12/1/1322756876629/Phillip-Inman-003.jpg\" alt=\"Phillip Inman\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Phillip Inman Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is possible that a bailout for Spain, an agreement for a eurozone-wide banking union and the appointment of a sword-wielding budget tsar will draw a line under the current crisis. Calm may also be restored because, above all, eurozone leaders are desperate to stay inside the currency zone to save face and tackle internal problems they themselves are incapable of dealing with (corruption in Greece and employment protections in Italy and Spain are two examples).</p> <p>But this optimism is set against the gamble that low-paid workers in the worst affected countries will accept a sharp decline in their living standards and the loss of democratic accountability that comes with the creation of centralised bureaucracies in Brussels.</p> <p>Keeping wages low and forcing the repayment of all bank and sovereign debts will act as a drag on consumer spending and growth for many years, prolonging the current depression. Spending cuts tend to affect lower income groups, especially when the cuts are to welfare payments.</p> <p>Britain is about to embark on the second stage of austerity with a particular focus on cuts to social security spending. The trade unions are already assessing the likely impact of a proposed general strike. There are concerns that leaders in Germany, Holland, Finland and Austria will demand that all debts be repaid by governments and banks in the periphery. That's a recipe for social unrest across the rest of Europe \u2013 something the International Monetary Fund has already warned about.</p> <p>\u2022 Phillip Inman is the Guardian's economics correspondent</p> <h2>Luis Garicano: Empty promises won't end the crisis</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397996169\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/18/1350574679385/Luis-Garicano.jpg\" alt=\"Luis Garicano\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Is it nearly over? No! Undoubtedly, the European Union took this summer three decisions which, if implemented, could end the critical stage of the crisis. First, the ECB decided to act like a grown-up central bank and deal forcefully with panic-driven rollover crisis in its member states bond markets. Second, the eurozone agreed a direct recapitalisation of Spain's failing banks. Third, a banking union was agreed.</p> <p>These measures could deal with legacy banking debt, allow member states to finance themselves at non-punitive rates and set up key institutions for a sustainable eurozone future. Regrettably, while the ECB's promise has not yet been tested, it looks like the other two were empty promises. Spain was recently told its legacy banking debt was its problem and nobody else's, clouding the prospect of a recovery any time soon. And the German government blocked all the steps towards the banking union. Spain is facing an unprecedented depression, which is putting at risk its very existence as a country. If its partners will not admit any responsibility for the legacy debt \u2013 the consequence of the poor Euro design \u2013 Spain will not get out of the hole, and Europe will remain at risk.</p> <p>\u2022 Luis Garicano is professor of economics and strategy at the London School of Economics and Political Science</p> <h2>Olaf Gersemann: This is only a respite</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397996170\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/18/1350577056673/Olaf.jpg\" alt=\"Olaf\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>We might have entered a period of relative calm in the eurozone. The key reason is simple: Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, wants to be re-elected in September 2013, and it seems obvious to observers in Berlin that until then she will try to prevent anything that might lead to renewed panic attacks on financial markets. This alone makes, among other things, a \"Grexit\" over the next 12 months unlikely.</p> <p>However, it's not only Greece that is still not on a sustainable path. It's far from clear if and how the euro club's southern members will bring down their debt levels and current account deficits decisively at a time when the chances of being bailed out by the ECB and the ESM. More specifically, only time will tell whether people in Portugal or Spain or Greece are willing to suffer through a multi-year painful adjustment period rather than having their countries leave the euro system. It is also far from assured how voters in Germany will react once they really have to pick up the bill.</p> <p>No, President Hollande is very likely to be wrong.

  "<p>Americans for Prosperity, the Tea Party-aligned group part-funded by the billionaire Koch brothers, is building a state-of-the-art digital ground operation in Ohio and other vital battleground states to spread its anti-Obama message to voters who could decide the outcome of the presidential election.</p> <p>The group hopes that by creating a local army of activists equipped with sophisticated online micro-targeting tools it will increase its impact on moderate voters, nudging them towards a staunchly conservative position opposed to President Obama's economic and healthcare policies. Americans for Prosperity (AFP) is spending tens of millions of dollars developing its local strategy, already employing more than 200 permanent staff in 32 states.</p> <p>Classified a non-profit \"social welfare\" organisation, AFP is legally obliged to project itself as a non-partisan campaign that neither endorses nor opposes candidates for public office. But there is no disguising its targets, nor their political nature.</p> <p>In Ohio, volunteers are given a script which they follow when engaging voters. \"President Obama took office three years ago and promised to fix our economy,\" they say, \"yet unemployment is still high and our debt is up to $6tn.\"</p> <p>AFP has already spent $30m so far this election cycle in opposing President Obama and other prominent Democratic candidates and their policies. It says it aims to reach up to 9 million targeted voters in crucial swing states, through the efforts of its 2 million activists.</p> <p>But it is ambitions do not stop on election day on 6 November. \"The goal is to build a long-term grassroots infrastructure,\" its president, Tim Phillips, told the Guardian. \"We are not some election-year group desperately trying to ramp up attention \u2013 we are in this year-in year-out to make a difference in favour of economic freedom.\"</p> <p>AFP's growing influence is highly visible in Ohio, one of the most crucial battleground states upon which November's outcome depends. It now has 80 paid staff operating in the state out of seven permanent offices.</p> <p>Volunteers are empowered with mobile canvassing technology that directs them to the households that are most likely to be influenced by AFP's message of small government and tax cuts through software built on to handheld tablet computers. They are also equipped with the latest phone banking technology through which they have made 400,000 calls to Ohio's voters since May.</p> <p>AFP's funding status allows it to raise unlimited sums from undisclosed sources, among them David and Charles Koch, brothers whose oil, coal and plastics businesses have earned them personal wealth of $25bn each. David Koch is president of the organisation's foundation.</p> <p><a href=\"http://mediaproject.wesleyan.edu/2012/09/12/convention-or-ad-bounce/\">Research by the independent Wesleyan Media Project</a> has found that AFP is spending an astonishing $6m every two weeks on TV advertising that favours Mitt Romney's presidential candidacy. That pays for more than 7,000 TV ads to be served in the battleground states and outguns even Romney's own spending on political adverts.</p> <p>With the presidential race tightening across the country in the wake of Obama's widely denounced performance in the first TV debate earlier this month, all eyes have turned to Ohio, which Romney must win if he is to have a fighting chance of taking the White House. No Republican candidate in history has won the presidency without bagging Ohio's electoral college votes that today stand at 18 out of the 270 needed for victory.</p> <p>Polls vary widely in Ohio, making predictions difficult. But the latest tracking survey by Real Clear Politics has Obama two points ahead of Romney \u2013 a statistical tie.</p> <p>AFP is also waging an aggressive campaign against Sherrod Brown, the Democratic senator for Ohio, under the rubric: \"Has Brown worked for you?\" It has a fleet of vans bearing the senator's picture with the logo: \"Obama's rubber stamp for failure.\"</p> <p>Leading figures within the Ohio Democratic party have been watching the activities of AFP and other outlying conservative groups with mounting alarm. Ted Strickland, the former Democratic governor of Ohio, told the Guardian that in his view the activities of such groups had the capacity \"to move us from a democracy to an oligarchy where a handful of wealthy people use their money to try to control the political process\".</p> <p>Strickland said that Brown's struggle to get re-elected was a \"clear example of the corrosive influence of outside money. He should be 20 points ahead were it not for a massive amount of negative advertising coming from billionaires trying to buy a senate seat\".</p> <p>(Recent polls have put Brown and his Republican challenger, Josh Mandel, neck and neck, though the latest survey from the Columbus Dispatch shows the incumbent pulling ahead.)</p> <p>AFP's ground operation in Ohio and other states is built around an interactive online network that links its volunteers with a centralised database of information on millions of American voters. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/07/koch-brothers-database-2012-election\">The database, called Themis after the Greek god of wisdom</a>, was created with the help of seed money from the Kochs.</p> <p>The database draws information on voters from a range of public and commercial sources to create a profile of their likely political behaviour. What you buy on Amazon; the magazines your subscribe to; your friends on Facebook; your age, neighbourhood, occupation and house value; what petitions you have signed; what church you belong to; whether or not you own a gun \u2013 all such data points and many more go towards the creation of your personal, albeit anonymous, voter file.</p> <p>That, in turn, allows AFP activists to micro-target households with a level of precision that could only be dreamed about in previous generations. \"This is an exponential leap forward for our side \u2013 with Themis as our crucial partner, we are able to leverage our dollars and refine our message,\" Phillips said.</p> <p>Much media attention has been paid this election cycle to the avalanche of billionaires' money, including that of the Koch brothers, that has been spent on negative TV adverts. But in the longer term, the creation of this local lattice of activists able to identify key voters through online micro-targeting could prove to be a far more effective political weapon.</p> <p>In AFP's case, its interactive database serves up what the group calls an \"affinity score\" for each voter. He or she is awarded a number from 0 to 1. Those registering 0 on the scale being so leftwing and pro-government in outlook that, from the organisation's perspective, they are not worth bothering with.</p> <p>Those showing a 1 are equally worth bypassing because they are already so in favour of tax and spending cuts that to talk to them would be preaching to the converted. The technology is interactive, so that if a volunteer discovers that the affinity score of a voter on the doorstep is inaccurate \u2013 he or she is found to be more or less fiscally conservative than the rating suggests \u2013 it can be instantly corrected. The information is sent back at the push of a button to Themis, which is thus constantly updated and improved.</p> <p>The target group for AFP are those voters who fall between 0.4 and 0.6 on the affinity score \u2013 those moderate voters deemed by its digital planners to be \"persuadables\". \"Our goal is to get everybody into the 0.7 to 1 zone. We want to move the center towards economic freedom, to drive the debate through word-of-mouth marketing,\" says Matt Seaholm, the national field director of AFP.</p> <p>He added that in his view it was working; that AFP were driving the debate to the right. \"Cap-in-trade is now a dirty word. Stimulus is now a dirty word. Debt and spending are at the forefront. These were things that were not talked about in the past.\"</p> <p>AFP began testing its new micro-targeting gadgetry in Wisconsin last year, where it used the technology to energise its 120,000 activists in a succession of volatile recall elections. The group's efforts were one factor behind the survival of the Tea Party-backed governor, Scott Walker, in his recall vote this June.</p> <p>Phillips rejects the argument that AFP and other conservative outside groups are having a pernicious impact on the democratic process. \"We are proud to have the support of the Kochs. They have every right to be involved in the political process \u2013 they have been steadfast in this area for four decades.\"</p> <p>He added that for Obama and other Democrats to complain about corporate money entering politics was \"hypocrisy at its greatest. It's laughable, and most Americans know it. Obama receives tens of millions from Hollywood and the entertainment industry \u2013 so that is good money, and other money is bad?\"</p>",

That would seem to be the message from Eton Style, the biggest viral sensation since, ooh, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-news-blog/2012/oct/17/mitt-romney-binders-full-of-women\" title=\"\">that Mitt Romney one five minutes ago</a>, which sees the poshest of pupils remaking <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0\" title=\"\">Psy's Gangnam Style</a> on their hallowed school grounds.</p> <p>Even as \"comedy\" virals go it's rather cringe-inducing. Yet an indepth analysis of the new lyrics \u2013 for it deserves nothing less \u2013 reveals that these over-privileged little herberts are just as needy, insecure and rubbish with the ladies as the rest of us plebs.</p> <p>So whereas there's a whole rap sheet of hip hop braggadocio on display here (\"I've got a lot of land to show,\" they sing at one point; elsewhere there are references to drinking Mo\u00ebt like water) there are also some insights into the damaged psyche of the fragile Etonian.</p> <p>\"We may be awkward, frustrated, lonely and insecure (hey), yes insecure (hey),\" they sing, before adding. \"We're not too social, can't talk to women, although we try (hey), we're just too shy (hey), If you approach us then we'll just break down and cry.\"</p> <p>This doesn't sound like the kind of bold talk you expect to hear from someone who will one day be deciding your basic rate of tax. One Old Etonian we spoke to agreed. \"Some of the lyrics, about being awkward and not so confident struck me as very un-Etonian. Most of the people there like to make out they're confident, nothing can get them down, and that they're all louche womanisers. It might be over-stating it but to me it almost seemed as if there was a glimmer of acknowledgement here that private education was a bit strange.\"</p> <p>So is this the message that the school really wants to put out? After all, the normally uptight school must have loosened the rules somewhat to allow them to film it on the grounds.</p> <p>\"The boys were completely open about making their film,\" says Eton's headteacher Tony Little. \"It's a self-deprecating piece of fun by some boys who are parodying themselves.\"</p> <p>As the boys involved give us a tour of their school, often in language that requires some kind of translation service (sample: \"We go to chambers here, it's where you go to speak to beaks\") you notice that a couple of masters (translation: \"teachers\" I think) even join in \u2013 one of them dancing wildly before getting back in his Jag.</p> <p>\"Eton's normally rather po-faced and serious,\" said our man in the know. \"I don't recognise that liberal attitude to filming. And they weren't rebels in the video, they were prefects \u2013 I know this because they were walking over special grass reserved especially for prefects.\"</p> <p>Special grass reserved just for them? Ah, and we were so close to concluding that those Etonians were just like you and me \u2026</p>",
  "<p>The Israeli cabinet may approve the legalisation of unauthorised Jewish settlement outposts in the West Bank, in a move likely to further damage peace prospects and result in censure from the international community.</p> <p>The prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has indicated his intention to put sections of a government-commissioned report to a cabinet vote. However, the attorney general is reported to be opposed to the move before <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/10/ehud-olmert-comeback-israeli-election\" title=\"\">next year's election</a>. A spokesman for the prime minister said: \"No decisions have been taken yet.\"</p> <p>Netanyahu is believed to be under pressure from extreme rightwing pro-settler elements within his party, Likud, in the runup to the election on 22 January. Israel Radio reported that the prime minister had instructed the cabinet secretary to draft a motion endorsing sections of the <a href=\"http://www.pmo.gov.il/English/MediaCenter/Spokesman/Documents/edmundENG100712.pdf\" title=\"\">89-page Levy repor</a>t, which was published in July.</p> <p>As well as calling for the legalisation of outposts, the report rejected international legal consensus that the West Bank was under Israeli military occupation. It said the fourth Geneva convention did not apply to the West Bank as it was not \"foreign territory\" under the sovereignty of another state.</p> <p>Critics warned that adoption of the report's conclusions would have damaging repercussions for Israel, further isolating it in the international arena and potentially killing off any chance of a resumption of talks with the Palestinians on a settlement of the decades-old conflict.</p> <p>Netanyahu intends to limit the cabinet vote to practical recommendations dealing with the legalisation of outposts, building permits and land purchase, according to reports.</p> <p>The prime minister established a three-strong panel, headed by a pro-settlement former supreme court judge, Edmond Levy, to examine unauthorised outposts in the West Bank, which are usually established by hardline, ideologically-driven settlers. Its conclusions contradicted those of a 2005 report that declared such colonies were illegal under Israeli law and should be demolished. Under international law, all settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem are illegal.</p> <p>The report's publication fuelled opposition to the evacuation and demolition of two West Bank outposts, Migron and Ulpana, which were declared illegal by Israel's supreme court. Despite repeated delays by the government, both operations were eventually completed peacefully.</p> <p>Netanyahu's drive to put the Levy report to a cabinet vote is viewed by some commentators as an attempt to prevent votes leaking from Likud to parties further to the right. Opinion polls taken since the election was called last week show the rightwing block is expected to emerge with a majority of parliament's 120 seats. Likud is likely to be the biggest party, although the possible formation of a new centre-left party could change predictions.</p> <p>Netanyahu's position as leader of Likud is secure, but he is acutely aware of internal party pressures. Militant settlers have gained strength within Likud, scoring victories this year when several \u2013 including radical activists from hilltop outposts \u2013 were elected to the party's central committee and their leader, Moshe Feiglin, secured about 25% of votes in a challenge to Netanyahu for the party chairmanship. About 7% of Likud's 130,000 registered members live in West Bank settlements.</p> <p>Netanyahu is also under pressure from smaller pro-settler parties to the right of Likud, which have called for the conclusions of the Levy report to be adopted.</p> <p>Both the centrist Kadima and the centre-left Labour party criticised the move to endorse sections of the report. The defence minister, Ehud Barak, also made clear his opposition, saying: \"Adopting the report will not bolster the settlement in Judea and Samaria [the biblical name for the West Bank], it will merely undermine Israel's diplomacy efforts and further isolate Israel from the world.\"</p> <p>Tamar Feldman, of the Association of Civil Rights in Israel, said: \"The situation in the West Bank is neither normal nor legal, and any attempt to authorise or normalise it threatens the rule of law in the state of Israel.\"</p>",

And in a perfect world, I'd get to join the group whenever I wanted.\"</p> <p>Fifteen years later, the show has spawned dozens of imitations around the world \u2013 Loose Women is its British incarnation. For presidential candidates (and their wives) who want to appeal to undecided women in swing states, it has become as essential a stop on the campaign trail as small-town diners in Iowa or Ohio. Last month's joint visit by Barack and Michelle Obama garnered a whopping 4.3 million viewers.</p> <p>This election year, the political segment is called Red, White and View. On Thursday it was Ann Romney's turn to take her place on the blue couch. She was supposed to be accompanied by her husband, Republican presidential candidate Mitt, <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/10/mitt-romney-cancels-on-the-view.html\">but he cancelled his appearance earlier this week</a>. (A decision that presumably looked pretty smart after his <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/17/binders-full-women-reconsider-voting-mitt-romney\">\"binders full of women\" remark during Tuesday's second presidential debate</a> spawned such derision).</p> <p>Romney came out wearing her signature scarlet dress, to standing applause, and sat on the center of the couch, to be confronted immediately by Walters. [Mitt] said he didn't want to come on with us \"because we are high risk and we are sharp tongued,\" she said.</p> <p>\"He said sharp and <em>young</em>,\" countered Mrs Romney, smiling brightly. Score one to her.</p> <p>Without missing a beat, Walters moved on to Romney's shifting position on abortion. \"I wonder what your views are,\" she asked.</p> <p>\"The good news is I'm not running for office and I don't have to say what I feel,\" said Mrs Romney, sunnily. Score two.</p> <p>\"Mitt has always been a pro-life person,\" she added, explaining that her husband was against embryo research. \"This is an issue that is so tender. The most important thing we can do is have respect for each other.\"</p> <p>Then she went in for the kill. The difference between what women were talking about when Romney campaigned four years ago and now was \"heart-breaking, Barbara. This year what I hear... 90, I would say 95% of what I hear is, 'Help, please help'.\"</p> <p>\"Economic help, you mean,\" offered Walters.</p> <p>\"Absolutely,\" said Mrs Romney, with all the conviction provided by her uncheckable number. Score three.</p> <p>Whoopi Goldberg tried to have a go at the fact that Mitt Romney did not serve in Vietnam because he was on a Mormon mission, but she got her facts mixed up and the fumble gave Mrs Romney the opportunity to point out that although neither her sons nor her husband had served in the military, they had all served on church missions; she added that one of her sons is a doctor who treats military veterans. Cue loving applause from the audience.</p> <p>Score four.</p> <p>After another commercial, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whose professional credentials consist of being a 2001 contestant on Survivor and marrying the American footballer Tim Hasselbeck, turned to Mrs Romney and asked if there had been a moment when she and Mitt had almost broken up.</p> <p>\"Well, not according to him,\" was the smiling reply.</p> <p>However, she said, early on in the relationship, when he was on his mission and they were apart for three and a half years, she dated a lot and came close to breaking his heart.</p> <p>The questions were getting softer and softer.</p> <p>In the early days of The View, the show was the perfect forum for political debate. But the host lineup has changed dramatically \u2013 gone are the empathetic Meredith Vieira and the colorful Star Jones. In are Goldberg and the token conservative, Hasselbeck. Walters, older and less with it, drifts in and out. The intelligence has been diluted and the shoutiness amplified. More often than not, the hour of The View resembles a Real Housewives reunion without the moderator.</p> <p>Mrs Romney's appearance finished against a vast photo of Ann and Mitt, all the kids and the 18 grandkids. The picture was of an all-American family who make dinner, clean up and share the household chores when together. Yes, all of that takes place at the family's \"Lake House\", but no-one bothered to comment on that. There was no mention of binders of women, either.</p> <p>The Romney segment closed with the ladies of The View slumped against the couch while their guest remained perky and upright.</p> <p>'You are a wonderful advocate for your husband,\" Walters had said.</p> <p>She got that right.</p>",

Ninkovic claims Rose was the instigator in the trouble, telling the Serbian newspaper Novosti: \"The guy three or four times made inappropriate gestures towards our fans. I was angered by his reaction so I rushed over to explain to him that he should not do that. I did not mean to hit him or insult him. I walked over to him and pushed him.</p> <p>\"A lot of his behaviour annoyed me but I know I was wrong and I know I will get a fine. I just hope it will not be too big. He received a red card and I got a yellow. That is probably an indication that his share of the story was significant.\"</p> <p>Serbia's prime minister, Ivica Dacic, who is also the country's police chief, has ordered a police investigation into the events at the match but said it was too soon to call it a racist incident.</p> <p>He said that all those who took part in the scuffles that broke out on the pitch after the final whistle must be identified and \"brought to justice\".</p>",
  "<p>Kang Il-chul was 16 when Japanese military police arrived at her home in South Korea and told her she was being conscripted. The year was 1943, and her country was just two years away from liberation after 35 years of brutal Japanese colonial rule.</p> <p>Kang spent the remainder of the war in occupied China, as one of tens of thousands of Asian women forced to have sex with Japanese soldiers in frontline, makeshift brothels. \"I was put in a tiny room and made to sleep with about 10 to 20 soldiers a day,\" says Kang, pausing to display the scars on her head \u2013 the result of frequent beatings by the military police. \"I was punched and beaten so much that my body was covered in bruises. I still get headaches.\"</p> <p>Almost 70 years after Japan's defeat, the treatment of such \"comfort women\" still haunts its relations with South Korea as the region, embroiled in long-standing territorial disputes, once again confronts the legacy of Japanese militarism. Lingering resentment over atrocities committed during the second world war \u2013 and the perception that Japan has failed to show enough remorse for its actions \u2013 help explain the periodical outbreaks of anti-Japanese rage in the region, and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/18/japanese-mps-war-shrine-china-korea\" title=\"\">angry reactions to high-profile visits to Yasukuni, the controversial war shrine in Tokyo</a>.</p> <p>\"Historical grievances in Korea do not depend on who is in charge in Japan,\" says Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University in Tokyo. \"They simmer on and on until every once in a while they boil over. Tokyo is living in a dream world if it believes that these matters are resolved and not worth addressing,\" he said.</p> <p>Earlier this week, South Korea repeated its demand that Japan acknowledge its use of former sex slaves and compensate them. \"Japan's legal responsibility has not been settled,\" the country's deputy chief envoy to the UN, Shin Dong-ik, told a UN committee. \"Those acts were a crime against humanity.\"</p> <p>Those grievances came to the fore again recently when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/10/south-korea-japan-disputed-islands\" title=\"\">South Korea's president, Lee Myung-bak, made a politically charged trip</a> to Dokdo \u2013 a pair of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/18/japan-south-korea-disputed-islands\" title=\"\">remote, rocky islands also claimed by Japan</a>, where they are known as Takeshima. The visit was not just intended to demonstrate his country's de facto control over the territory. Lee linked his visit to Tokyo's failure to apologise for the use of sex slaves, and challenged Japan's emperor, Akihito, to issue a mea culpa on the country's behalf.</p> <p>Japan retaliated last week by deciding <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/10/09/uk-korea-japan-swap-idUKBRE89805W20121009\" title=\"\">not to renew a $57bn (\u00a335.5bn) currency swap with South Korea</a> \u2013 a measure designed to protect both countries against financial crisis \u2013 although officials in Seoul and Tokyo said the decision was made on economic grounds and the territorial dispute was not a factor.</p> <p>Lee's remarks were in part a vote-winning exercise for his conservative Saenuri party <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/10/park-geun-hye-korean-president\" title=\"\">before December's presidential election</a>, but also proof that wartime history still weighs heavily on the South Korean national psyche \u2013 and finds voice in an enduring suspicion of Japan.</p> <p>There is disagreement on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jun/14/worlddispatch.secondworldwar\" title=\"\">exact number of women forced into prostitution by Japan</a>. Campaigners believe between 50,000 and 200,000 women \u2013 mostly Koreans, but also Chinese, south-east Asians and a small number of Japanese and Europeans \u2013 were forced or tricked into working in military brothels between 1932 and 1945.</p> <p>Fearing ostracism in their own countries, most took their secret to the grave. But in 1991, Kim Hak-soon, a South Korean, became the first to testify about her wartime forced prostitution experiences in public. \"We must record these sins that were forced upon us,\" she said.</p> <p>Since then, more than 230 women have identified themselves as former sex slaves. Only about 60 are still alive. Eight, including Kang, live at the <a href=\"http://www.nanum.org/eng\" title=\"\">House of Sharing,</a> a facility that opened in 1992 in the hills south of Seoul.</p> <p>The women, most of whom are in their 80s and 90s, say they have yet to receive an official apology or compensation from Japan over their treatment.</p> <p>The Japanese government initially denied the existence of \"comfort stations\", as the brothels were known. But in 1993 Yohei Kono, the-then chief cabinet secretary, acknowledged and apologised for the first time for Japan's use of sex slaves during the second world war.</p> <p>Japan refused to directly compensate the women, saying all claims were settled by postwar peace treaties. In 1995 it set up the privately run <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Women%E2%80%99s_Fund\" title=\"\">Asian women's fund</a>, which drew on donations, but many women rejected any redress unless it came directly from the Japanese state. The fund was disbanded in 2007.</p> <p>Kono's statement infuriated Japanese conservatives. They recently gained an ally in the country's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/30/japan-yoshihiko-noda-prime-minister\" title=\"\">supposedly progressive prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda</a>, who, despite conceding that individual testimony indicated the coercion of Asian women into sexual slavery, claimed no documentary evidence existed.</p> <p>His main opponent in the next general election, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/26/japanese-nationalist-tipped-pm-china\" title=\"\">Liberal Democratic party leader, Shinzo Abe</a>, has even called for the Kono statement to be revised.</p> <p>The spread of frontline brothels followed the Japanese imperial army's sweep through large parts of China and south-east Asia. As colonial ruler of the Korean peninsula since 1910, Japan had easy access to local women, targeting poor, uneducated and single females aged between 13 and 19.</p> <p>On display in a museum near the women's residence are photographs, documents and exhibits that shed light on their wretched existence before they were abandoned by fleeing Japanese troops at the end of the war.</p> <p>Typically, they were forced to have sex with 10 to 30 men a day in dimly lit rooms furnished only with beds. Condoms were washed and re-used and offered little protection against sexually transmitted diseases. Medical examinations were infrequent, and many women became addicted to the mercury 606 used to treat syphilis. Forced abortions were commonplace.</p> <p>Surprisingly, the Japanese comprise about two-thirds of the estimated 15,000 people who visit the House of Sharing every year. In the past, the residents were happy to meet members of the public, but in recent weeks some have refused to talk to Japanese visitors. \"They wonder why Japanese visitors don't go home and tell everyone the truth about the comfort women,\" said a Japanese member of staff who did not wish to be named.</p> <p>After the war, Kang settled in north-west China where she married a local man and worked as a nurse. She did not return to South Korea until 2000, and these days speaks her native tongue with a heavy Chinese accent.</p> <p>She and other former comfort women have maintained pressure on Japan during weekly demonstrations outside its embassy in Seoul. Last December they conducted their 1,000th protest.</p> <p>The 85-year-old, who was given the Japanese name Tamako Okada while working in military brothels, said Japan's recent backpedalling would only prolong the agony of former sex slaves. \"To hear Japan's leaders accuse us of being liars makes me sad and angry,\" she said. \"I have nothing against ordinary Japanese people. This is their government's fault. The prime minister says there is no proof that we existed. But I am living proof.\"</p> <h2>Japan's war apologies</h2> <p>Earlier this month, a large billboard appeared in Times Square in New York. Beneath the question, \"Do you remember?\" is a black-and-white photograph from 1971 of the former German chancellor Willy Brandt kneeling before a monument to victims of the Warsaw Uprising. That simple gesture, the signs says, \"promoted reconciliation in Europe\".</p> <p>It continues: \"In 2012, Korean women forced to work as sex slaves for Japanese soldiers during WWII are still waiting for a heartfelt apology from Japan.\"</p> <p>Japan is often accused of never matching Germany's remorse for its wartime conduct. In fact, Japanese leaders, and its current emperor, have issued several apologies and expressed remorse. In addition to compensation agreed in postwar peace treaties, Japan points out that it has since extended generous aid and development packages to its former victims.</p> <p>On the 50th anniversary of the end of the war in 1995, the then socialist prime minister, Tomiichi Murayama, said: \"Japan, through its colonial rule and aggression, caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly those of Asia.</p> <p>\"In the hope that no such mistake will be made in the future, I regard, in a spirit of humanity, these irrefutable facts of history, and express here once again my feelings of deep remorse and state my heartfelt apology.\"</p> <p>Two years earlier, Yohei Kono, then the chief cabinet secretary, acknowledged that the Japanese military had coerced Asian women into sexual slavery.</p> <p>The Kono statement, according to a recent editorial in the Korean press, deserves praise for \"extending its sincere apologies and remorse to all those who suffered immeasurable pain and incurable physical and psychological wounds as comfort women\".</p> <p>But it is the nature, and perceived insincerity, of the apologies that continues to trouble China and South Korea.</p> <p>For the 60 or so surviving comfort women, previous expressions of remorse do not go far enough; instead, they are demanding an official apology and compensation directly from the Japanese government.</p> <p>In 2007, they won support from the US House of Representatives, which passed a resolution urging Japan to \"formally acknowledge, apologise, and accept historical responsibility in a clear and unequivocal manner\" for the coercion of young women into sexual slavery.</p> <p>Demands for a formal apology and compensation will continue, at least as long as Japan, in Lee Myung-bak's words, refuses to summon the \"courage and wisdom to look squarely at history\".</p>",
  "<p>As America's pastor for the past half century, Billy Graham has earned a reputation as a wise and holy man. But the respect he has gained as a man of unflinching, unerring principles has been severely compromised by his Evangelistic Association's decision to remove a reference to Mormonism from its website.</p> <p>The faith had been listed as a cult along with Scientology and Jehovah's Witnesses in a section called Billy Graham's My Answer, <a href=\"http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/16/billy-grahams-group-removes-mormon-cult-reference-from-website-after-romney-meeting/\" title=\"\">but the comment was taken down shortly after he and his son Franklin met with Mitt Romney</a>, America's most famous Mormon.</p> <p>Not only does the move represent a sacrificing of values for political expediency, but it also smacks of double standards, given Franklin Graham's treatment of President Obama. Asked on Piers Morgan's CNN show this week whether Romney could be regarded as a Christian, he refused to answer, arguing he felt it inappropriate to speculate on the Massachusetts governor's faith.</p> <p>Yet, he has less compunction when it comes to discussing Barack Obama's faith. In <a href=\"http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/02/21/10466877-rev-graham-obama-seen-as-son-of-islam?lite\" title=\"\">an MSNBC interview</a> he said couldn't categorically say Obama was not a Muslim \"because Islam has gotten a free pass\" under his presidency. And in an earlier interview, he said he <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2012/02/21/428945/franklin-graham-obama-may-secretly-be-a-muslim-santorum-and-gingrich-are-definitely-christian/?mobile=nc\" title=\"\">believed thrice-married Newt Gingrich's assurances that he was a Christian</a>, yet questioned Obama's faith even though the president personally told him he is a Christian.</p> <p>\"Now he has told me that he is a Christian. But the debate comes, what is a Christian?\" he said. \"For him, going to church means he's a Christian. For me, the definition of a Christian is whether we have given our life to Christ and are following him in faith and we have trusted him as our lord and saviour.\"</p> <p>The contrast between the Grahams' treatment of the two presidential candidates has been highlighted further by the statements they gave following their recent meetings with Obama and Romney.</p> <p>While April's meeting with the president was described as \"very cordial, very nice\", Billy Graham described it as \"a privilege\" to pray with Romney, and <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/under-god/post/franklin-graham-questions-obamas-christian-beliefs-calls-santorum-a-man-of-faith/2012/02/21/gIQAIeElRR_blog.html\" title=\"\">said he would do all he could to help him</a>.</p> <p>Visiting Billy Graham is something of an obligatory pilgrimage for presidents and White House hopefuls, but he has never before been so openly political by <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-billy-graham-romney-endorsement-20121011,0,2827291.story\" title=\"\">apparently endorsing one of the candidates</a>.</p> <p>\"I hope millions of Americans will join me in praying for our nation and to vote for candidates who will support the biblical definition of marriage, protect the sanctity of life and defend our religious freedoms,\" Graham said.</p> <p>Given Obama's support for gay marriage and abortion, the evangelist's call for Christians to get behind Romney could hardly be much clearer.</p> <p>It is entirely understandable that Billy Graham has concerns about these issues, but taken in the context of Franklin Graham's previous doubting of Obama's faith, they are suggesting that it's not possible to be a Christian and be socially liberal.</p> <p>Franklin questioned Obama's profession of Christianity even before the president had come out in support of gay marriage, which leaves you wondering why he is so sceptical and hoping that it isn't merely because of his Kenyan ancestry.</p> <p>Whatever the reason, they are feeding the bigotry of the racists under a cloak of Christian conservatism.</p> <p>Yet they have agreed to go quiet on their <a href=\"http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2012/06/21/bias-against-mormon-presidential-candidate-unchanged-since-1967-poll-finds/\" title=\"\">opposition to Mormonism</a> despite widespread concern in America among evangelical Christians and previously saying that it \"deviates from the biblical message of the Christian faith\".</p> <p>They are sending out a message that says God is on the side of the white, conservative Mormon rather than the black, liberal Christian.</p> <p>By becoming so political they risk damaging the incredible work Billy Graham has done in spreading a gospel that preached forgiveness for all, because it turns out repenting might not be enough.</p> <p>Instead, you have to ask for your liberal views to be washed away as well because your faith will always be suspect unless you subscribe to a certain brand of Christianity.</p> <p>Surely, after all his years of life-changing ministry, that's not the legacy that Graham wanted to leave behind?</p>",

He didn't do it. He had a Democrat House and Democrat Senate, super majority in both houses. Why did he fail to even promote legislation that would have provided an answer for those that want to come here legally and for those that are here illegally today?\" Romney said.</p> <p>Obama sidestepped the question, listing changes to the immigration system he had made but not addressing why he failed to put a bill to Congress for comprehensive reform. </p> <p>However, while many Latino voters are unhappy with the president about that, there is little evidence they have confidence in Romney and the Republican party to address immigration in a way that is sympathetic to undocumented migrants. </p> <p>Romney's advert promises to unite families, provide work permits and find permanent solutions for undocumented youth living in the US. But he has offered only sketchy policy proposals and Obama noted that Romney's adviser on the issue was at the forefront of drawing up Arizona's controversial law permitting the police to challenge people over their immigration status.</p> <p>In a second Spanish-language advert released on Wednesday, Romney attacks Obama with allegations he has made more than $700m in cuts to Medicare \u2013 a theme the Republicans have repeatedly pressed during the campaign despite fact checkers saying the charge is false.</p>"
