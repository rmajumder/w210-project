  "<p>Scores of civilians in Rwanda have allegedly been tortured into making false confessions after being detained illegally without charge or trial, an investigation by <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org/en/region/rwanda\" title=\"Amnesty International\">Amnesty International</a> has found.</p> <p>Former detainees claimed they were subjected to electric shocks, severe beatings and sensory deprivation while being held at a military camp and a secret network of safe houses in the capital, Kigali, according to Amnesty.</p> <p>The report is the latest blow to the Rwandan president Paul Kagame's battered reputation following allegations of persecuting opponents, gagging media and arming rebels in the neighbouring <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/28/congo-warlord-rwanda-kagame-defies-un?intcmp=239\" title=\"Democratic Republic of Congo.\">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a>. International donors have partially suspended aid but Britain in particular <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/rwanda/9591675/Britain-under-pressure-to-end-all-aid-to-Rwandan-government.html\" title=\"is under mounting pressure\">is under mounting pressure</a> to go further.</p> <p>Amnesty's report, Rwanda: Shrouded in Secrecy, Illegal Detention and Torture by Military Intelligence, asserts a pattern of unlawful detention, enforced disappearances and allegations of torture carried out by operatives from a military intelligence unit known as J2.</p> <p>Most of the detainees were rounded up by the military from March 2010 onwards after a series of deadly grenade attacks in Kigali and in the runup to the August 2010 presidential election, which Kagame won with 93% after two of his main challengers were jailed.</p> <p>Three former detainees from the military Camp Kami told Amnesty they were subjected to electric shocks during interrogations by J2 operatives. \"I was taken to another office,\" one recalled. \"Everyone was there when they put this electric thing on my back and forced me to accept that I worked with the people throwing the grenades . When I got to the point of dying, I told them to bring me a piece of paper [to sign], but they continued to torture me.\"</p> <p>Another told Amnesty's researchers: \"There are other rooms where they put you and you lose your memory. They ask you a question and when you find yourself again they ask you a question. When you return to normal, they sting you. The electric thing they use is like a pen and they put it under your arms. It is like charcoal. When they sting you, all your body is electrolysed and the entire body is paralysed.\"</p> <p>Amnesty said it had received three independent reports that some detainees at Camp Kami had bags placed over their heads during interrogations to restrict their breathing. Former prisoners said they had items placed in their mouth to heighten pain and stop them screaming while they were beaten during interrogations.</p> <p>Detention periods ranged from 10 days to nine months without access to lawyers, doctors or family members, Amnesty said. Many of these detainees were later charged with threatening national security. Two individuals \u2013 Robert Ndengeye Urayeneza and Sheikh Iddy Abbasi \u2013 are still missing since their disappearance in March 2010, the NGO added.</p> <p>Sarah Jackson, Amnesty's acting deputy Africa director, said: \"The Rwandan military's human rights record abroad is increasingly scrutinised, but their unlawful detention and torture of civilians in Rwanda is shrouded in secrecy. Donors funding military training must suspend financial support to security forces involved in human rights violations.\"</p> <p>Amnesty said it had conducted more than 70 interviews and documented 45 cases of unlawful detention and 18 allegations of torture or ill-treatment at Camp Kami, Mukamira military camp and in safe houses in Kigali.</p> <p>Rwandan officials dismissed the findings. Alphonse Hitiyaremye, the country's deputy prosecutor general, told Amnesty: \"There is no torture in our country and we can't investigate on a false allegation.\"</p> <p>Tito Rutaremara, a senator who has worked with Kagame for 25 years, told the Guardian: \"Let Amnesty come and show us these 'safe houses'. If they know all this, let them come and say it is here. Bring these witnesses.\"</p> <p>Louise Mushikiwabo, the foreign affairs minister, posted on Twitter: \"Rwanda will act on all credible claims of torture but won't engage in a shouting match w/ another NGO seeking headlines at Rwanda's expense.\"</p>",
  "<p>As western forces eye the emergency exit in Afghanistan, not a month goes by without someone in charge lowering expectations. Last week, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/01/nato-forces-afghanistan-early-retreat\" title=\"\">Nato's secretary-general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen told this newspaper</a> that the retreat could come sooner than expected in 2014, as morale had been sapped by insider killings. A day later, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/02/afghanistan-british-ambassador-richard-stagg?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Sir Richard Stagg, Britain's ambassador in Kabul, said</a> the west had done enough \"hand-holding\" and Kabul should be left to get on with running the country. They&#xa0;are not moving the goalposts. They are walking off with them.</p> <p>Remember the old trope about conditions on the ground dictating the pace of Nato's withdrawal? It comes as no surprise to learn that conditions are, on some counts, worsening. The much-vaunted drop in civilian casualties may just have been a result of record snowfalls. August this year became the second deadliest month on record. The Taliban have not just weathered the US troop surge \u2013 the coalition forces, or Isaf as they are known, have been unable to dislodge them from the south and east. Next year's spring offensive promises to be the deadliest yet, spurred on by the imminence of withdrawal and elections.</p> <p>Targeted killings of government officials and politicians have tripled. Three elections are to come as the Taliban press home their advantage \u2013 provincial councils in 2013, the presidency in 2014 and parliament in 2015, so the opportunity for mayhem is unbounded.</p> <p>With the proposed rate of 20 base closures a month, the job of holding the country together will come down to an Afghan national army, only 7% of which is currently considered capable of independent action, even with foreign advisers. <a href=\"http://www.crisisgroup.org/\" title=\"\">The International Crisis Group in a report</a> on Monday paints a bleak picture of Afghanistan's readiness to prepare for elections and a transfer of power after Hamid Karzai's mandate ends. It quotes one veteran Afghan security official as saying there is no national army or police force, only a factionalised one which could instantly fissure. The international community, it warns, has one last chance to leave a viable state in Afghanistan, by helping Afghans prepare for an election and a smooth transfer of presidential power. About 18 months remain to prevent a repeat of the chaos and fraud of previous elections. Failure to do so in a corrupt and factionalised state would lead to civil war on the heels of Nato's withdrawal, especially if President Karzai tries to stay in power by declaring a state of emergency. Under these conditions the army would not maintain its nominal unity.</p> <p>An exit like this would leave the US with just two points of historical comparison: the fall of Saigon in 1975, and Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989. Of the two, the Soviet parallel is looking closer each day.</p>",

Both sides had warned that the other was preparing to destabilise the country.</p> <p>But at the polling booths the mood was peaceful and, though partisan, fiercely democratic. The lines of voters outside the polling station in La Florida curled beyond the Cervantes high school, past the housing blocks and up the hill as far as the eye could see. Locals said they had never seen such a turnout, a sign of the interest generated by the vibrant political race and what some believed was an outside chance of an upset.</p> <p>\"In every election, there are a lot of people here, but never like this. People want a change,\" said a 50-year-old housewife, Marcoline Uzcategui, as she stood outside the polling station. \"I don't want to carry on living like this. I have a faint illusion that things may change this time, but Ch\u00e1vez has all the power so I don't want to get my hopes up too high.\"</p> <p>Others said they would stick with the president. \"Ch\u00e1vez will win because he has supported the people,\" said Alfredo Alvarez, a lawyer. \"He's administered funds as he should.\"</p> <p>The show of people power was impressive. Even Ch\u00e1vez's critics acknowledge that he has encouraged greater public participation in decision-making.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397329317\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/10/7/1349642112670/Hugo-Ch-vez-008.jpg\" alt=\"Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Venezuela\u2019s Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, facing his most serious challenge since he was elected president in 1998, greets crowds in Caracas.

Although he has not been as prominent on the campaign trail as in the past, a huge rally in Caracas on Thursday showed his formidable campaign power and charisma.</p> <p>His 40-year-old opponent, Henrique Capriles, has won kudos for an energetic campaign but in an election day tweet acknowledged he was the underdog. \"Today we decide the future of our Venezuela,\" Capriles tweeted. \"Today we are millions of Davids! God will be our guide,\" he added, referring to his depiction of the vote as the biblical underdog's battle against Goliath.</p> <p>Ahead of the vote, opinion polls suggested the president would be re-elected, albeit by a margin well below his previous landslide victories. But the large number of undecided voters gave late momentum to Capriles.</p> <p>With Venezuela sitting on the world's largest oil reserves and Ch\u00e1vez a leading figure in the resurgence of the political left in Latin America, the vote will have an impact on the global economy, energy supplies and regional geopolitics.</p> <p>But for most of the country's almost 19&#xa0;million voters, the key concerns are the alarming rise in the murder rate, the redistribution of oil wealth, and the personality and health of the man who has led them for the past 13 years.</p> <p>In the 23 de Enero neighbourhood where Ch\u00e1vez casts his vote, the strong revolutionary spirit is evident in elaborate wall murals depicting Karl Marx, the Paris communes, Fidel Castro and \u2013 of course \u2013 Hugo Ch\u00e1vez.</p> <p>But the surge in murder and violent crime have tempted some voters here to consider alternatives. \"My vote is a secret because the situation is quite difficult. There is a good candidate this year who has put up a fight against the president,\" said Plajeres Rangel, a 35-year-old hairdresser, who said security was one of her main concerns.</p> <p>Commune leaders said Chavez maintained a solid core of support, but they acknowledged gains made by the Capriles campaign. \"This area is strongly pro-Ch\u00e1vez, but the opposition has made inroads. They've been campaigning here for the first time and they've come out on to the streets, which they didn't do before,\" said Jos\u00e9 Roberto Duque, a journalist at a community radio station.</p> <p>\"I'm here with my family to share a stellar moment for Bolivian socialist democracy,\" said Noel Marquez, the director of a revolutionary music collective and composer of some of Castro's campaign jingles. \"This is a country that is deeply committed to democracy. We have a trustworthy voting system, but the opposition have plans to distort things. They have created a climate of uncertainty, but the people will defend the vote.\"</p> <p>On the eve of the vote, Ch\u00e1vez said he would accept any outcome and urged the opposition to do the same. \"I call on all political actors from the left, right and centre for us to prepare emotionally to accept tomorrow's result. It won't be the end of the world for anybody,\" he said in a televised address .</p> <p>Analysts fear a narrow win for either side could spark accusations of fraud and street violence. This has put the voting system under intense scrutiny, but it appears robust. External observers and domestic analysts have lauded the procedure as one of the most sophisticated in the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397329315\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349291253838/Henrique-Capriles-010.jpg\" alt=\"Henrique Capriles\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Presidential candidate Henrique Capriles has promised that he would maintain many of Ch\u00e1vez's social programmes.

They then cast an electronic vote for their preferred party candidate on a touchscreen. Their vote entered the central counting system and was printed so that they could confirm it was recorded properly before that hard copy was put in a ballot box, more than half the contents of which would later be cross-checked with the electronic data to ensure the system had not been hacked.</p> <p>Voters then had to sign a form to confirm they had cast a vote. Before they left, the little finger on their left hand was marked with indelible purple ink so they could not return to vote a second time. \"This system is 100% fraud-proof and has been recognised as such by outside political institutions,\" said Luis Guillermo Piedra, of the National Electoral Council.</p> <p>Former US president Jimmy Carter has described the system as superior to that of the US. His Carter Centre, based in Atlanta, Georgia, has noted that many Venezuelans are concerned a new electronic voting system might enable authorities to tell how they voted, exposing them to retaliation if they voted against Ch\u00e1vez. \"This concern has no basis, however,\" the centre said. \"The software of the voting machines guarantees the secrecy of the vote.\"</p> <p>There is less certainty about what happens outside the voting booths. The opposition has lodged 110 complaints alleging abuses of election laws by the Ch\u00e1vez campaign, mostly relating to his domination of airtime on public broadcasting outlets and use of funds, staff and other resources from state-owned enterprises. They also feared that armed militias put pressure on voters before they went to the polls, though there have been no reports of this to date.</p> <p>\"I'll stay at home tonight to keep safe. If there is a close result, there might be trouble,\" said Jesus Gallardo, a shopkeeper who serves his customers through steel bars. He said he voted for Ch\u00e1vez, but added that he understands why the race has been tighter this time. \"Many people are unhappy because of insecurity and failed promises.\"</p>",
  "<p>Call them the believers. The three people who gathered at a Pittsburgh cafe on a sunny morning last month weren't merely supporters of Barack Obama back in 2008 \u2013 they were investors in him, full of hope for what his presidency might deliver.</p> <p>Iraqi war veteran Helen Gerhardt got to meet the then-candidate, and bend his ear about the Middle East. Her election day was spent driving African-Americans to polling stations: \"We had the music up, and we were partying all the way there. It was one of the biggest highs of my life.\"</p> <p>Rosemary Trump and Dan Beeton went to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/20/barack-obama-presidential-inauguration-washington\" title=\"\">presidential inauguration</a> in January 2009. They make it sound like a cross between an outdoor rock concert and a particularly weepy wedding: 1.8&#xa0;million strangers tearfully hugging each other on the Mall. Trump petitioned her congressman for tickets; trekked to her sister's place in Maryland; stayed out late at a ball the night before; got up at 4am to schlep into Washington; legged over security barriers to get nearer the action and remained on her feet till 7pm. Trump is 64.</p> <p>Beeton remembers peering at a giant screen showing Bush and Cheney: \"I thought: 'At last, they're gone!'\" Trump bursts into Happy Days Are Here Again and asks: \"How would you ever duplicate that moment?\"</p> <p>Ask how enthusiastic they feel this time and the responses are far more muted. Former Democrat campaigner Gerhardt is furious: \"I can't tell you how betrayed I feel. The people on Wall Street who have wrecked our economy have been let off the hook, while if you're caught with a gram of marijuana you're sent to jail.\"</p> <p>What about Reagan's famous question: are you personally better off now than you were four years ago? A pensioner, Trump frets about how younger members of her family will fare in the jobs market. Beeton mentions his partner, Amy, and how her business as a professional fundraiser has got tougher. Such anxieties are perhaps the common currency of life amid a slump, but Gerhardt's story gives some idea of just what devastation this one has caused.</p> <p>Finishing a postgraduate degree, she left the University of Pittsburgh last summer loaded down with student debt and unable to land anything more than a part-time job. For much of this year, she slept in her car. A badly dented Chevy parked around the corner from work served as her address until just over a month ago, when family took over the loans and a friend put her up in an attic.</p> <p>Obama is the very definition of a crisis leader, winning an election just weeks after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and George Bush's panicky warning that \"this sucker could go down\". His job was to sort out the crisis. There's just one problem with that: crises have many causes and symptoms \u2013 which should the president focus on? Even as Obama was taking the oath of office, the economy's freefall was accelerating \u2013 so that by October of his first year, one in 10 workers was out of a job. Beyond that were a whole host of other crises: the bombed-out housing market, the out-of-control finance sector, the dependence on imported fossil fuels.</p> <p>Then there was the economic model which many, <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2010/wp10268.pdf\" title=\"\">including researchers at the IMF</a> , argue gave rise to the subprime crisis: a country in which cheap credit had substituted for real improvements in workers' pay and conditions. Obama believers would have put fixing that one near the top of their list.</p> <p>There was never a hope in hell that the Crisis President could accomplish all of those. What dismays activists and economists alike is how little progress he has made: the big banks remain supersized, the housing market has largely been left to heal itself. Nearly four years later, the best that can be said is that he's overseen an agonisingly slow recovery.</p> <p>This is still better than Britain, which is stuck on the world economy's hard shoulder. America's jobless rate now stands at 7.8% \u2013 below the UK's 8.1%. And while the UK's annual national income <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2012/cr12190.pdf\" title=\"\">is still about 5% below its 2008 level</a>, the US has made back all its lost GDP \u2013 and then some.</p> <p>Yet even the $1.25tn spent over the years by the Democrats on tax cuts, infrastructure spending and social security (not to mention the hundreds of billions pumped into the markets by the US central bank) has not been big enough, given the size of the black hole. As Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, says: \"Government stimulus has allowed us to motor out of a depression, but it's not been enough for the economy to achieve real velocity.\"</p> <p>This leaves much of Obama's base no richer. Strip out inflation, and wages for the typical American worker are pretty much the same as they were five years ago; indeed, they've barely risen since the dotcom bubble burst. Whether Reagan or Clinton or the second Bush, the trend in recent presidential elections has been for incumbents to be re-elected. Yet according to the pollsters at Pew, the dismal consumer confidence figures notched up under Obama this year are easily as low as those of Jimmy Carter and George Bush Sr when they went for re-election \u2013 and lost.</p> <p>\"With an economy as bad as this, Obama would normally lose the election,\" says Dean Baker at the Center for Economic and Policy Research. \"And were he facing anyone less useless than Romney \u2013 Reagan, Dubya, anyone \u2013 he almost certainly would lose.\"</p> <p><strong>A tale of two bridges </strong></p> <p>Even that judgment isn't as harsh as the one delivered by <a href=\"http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/home/member_information/Senate_bio.cfm?id=1035\" title=\"\">Jim Ferlo</a>, the Pennsylvania state senator covering most of Pittsburgh and an early supporter of Obama in his battle for the Democrat nomination. \"Before you ask, I've already given my campaign contribution,\" he announces. \"It was a cheque for two cents.\"</p> <p>With the cheque (which Obama's team cashed), Ferlo sent a letter giving his two-cents-worth, accusing his former ally of \"flip-flopping\" on everything from healthcare to the suspension of habeas corpus. Then there's the cash from the stimulus package: \"The White House made getting that money so bureaucratic and cumbersome.\"</p> <p>What irked him most was something most Beltway analysts barely talk about: the administration's insistence on projects being \"shovel-ready\", with paperwork already settled in order to qualify for the stimulus cash. To prove the cost of that, Ferlo shows me two bridges a short drive from his office.</p> <p>One was built with Obama's dollars: a dinky footbridge that enables Pittsburgh's \"granola heads\" to walk over to a branch of the ultra-expensive Whole Foods. A small job, it was ready to go when the Recovery Act (the economic stimulus package) landed in 2009. Two minutes up the road is a bigger vehicular bridge that's \"unsafe at any speed\". Rebuilding that would have created more work and been far more useful, but the Is and Ts were not dotted and crossed in time. By Ferlo's account, there are several thousand failed bridges, locks and dams across Pennsylvania that could have benefited from Obama money.</p> <p>The curious thing about all this grumbling is how out of place it seems in Pittsburgh, which appears to be that rare thing: a city that has found a post-industrial afterlife, suffering much less from unemployment than the country as a whole. What was a steel town as recently as the 80s is now dominated by \"eds and meds\": universities and healthcare.</p> <p>Involved in local politics for over a quarter of a century, Ferlo can take as much credit for this turnaround as anyone else. But in his complaints about the lack of good blue collar jobs and grumbling about free trade, he fits the profile of so many Obama believers, who wanted his leader to do more than just keep a broken system upright.</p> <p>Just after the 2008 election, TIME put Obama on its front cover, digitally manipulated to look like America's last great crisis leader, Franklin Roosevelt. \"The New New Deal\" read the strapline, referring to FDR's reshaping of the economy. This mood infected the incoming team.</p> <p>In The Escape Artists: How Obama's Team Fumbled the Recovery, Noam Scheiber recounts an early conversation between the president-elect and Tim Geithner, his chosen Treasury secretary. \"Your signature accomplishment is going to be averting a Great Depression,\" Geithner tells Obama. His new boss replies: \"That's not enough for me.\"</p> <p><strong>The young ones </strong></p> <p>This election campaign has been much more focused on this or that gaffe and these or those figures than on such political dreaminess. The disenchantment is evident not just in the sourness of the campaign rhetoric, but also in how putative voters describe their choices. Across town from Ferlo's office, at Carnegie Mellon University, I asked a class of first-year undergraduates how they would vote. The majority plumped for Obama, but with no great zeal.</p> <p>\"People were more enthusiastic last time around,\" noted Myles Blodnick, listlessly. \"They used a lot of buzzwords.\" What worried the class more was the debt they were getting into to fund their degrees \u2013 in Blodnick's case $20,000 just to start his first term. Nor will they necessarily earn the money to pay it all back.</p> <p>At the Tin Front Cafe, I spoke to Mike and Steffi Stout and their 23-year-old daughter, Maura. The parents had also been to the inauguration (\"It was like a new world opened up; just for an afternoon,\" said Steffi), and could list ways in which the Obama administration had helped them keep their printers' business afloat. What worried them far more was what lay ahead for Maura, just a couple of years out of college.</p> <p>\"Maybe four people out of my class have got good jobs,\" reckoned Maura. By class, she meant her entire year's intake of 500 graduates. Her former roommates worked in fast-fashion shops, \"and they got really good grades\"; her graduate husband, Mike, had still not got a job so worked in his dad's construction business.</p> <p>Maura had recently got a new post, looking after accounts at a downtown hotel. The advertised pay was $13 an hour, but the manager added a dollar an hour \"so you can tell your mother you got a dollar for going to college\". That made $14 an hour, which her father calculated was the same as he earned as a steel worker in 1978 \u2013 and that's without adding four decades of inflation.</p> <p>In his inauguration address, Obama told Trump and Beeton and the Stouts and hundreds of thousands of others that a nation couldn't prosper long \"when it favours only the prosperous\".</p> <p>Such optimism wasn't for Maura: \"I don't think I'm ever going to earn as much as my parents. I don't think my husband and I will ever have the same life as they did.\"</p>",
  "<p>At a dinner table in Akron, Ohio, recently half a dozen Democratic activists took a break from trashing <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Nader\" title=\"\">Ralph Nader</a> for allowing a Bush victory in 2000 to discuss the material benefits of Barack Obama's first&#xa0;term. One had been able to keep his&#xa0;children on his healthcare plan after&#xa0;graduation; another with a pre-existing condition had been able to move plans without penalty. Then there&#xa0;was an awkward silence, broken by the mention of the jobs saved in Toledo, 140 miles away, by the auto bailout. That brought us on to Republican Mitt Romney's call to \"<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/19/opinion/19romney.html?ex=1384837200&amp;en=3616fe7f95dd6a7b&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=digg&amp;exprod=digg\" title=\"\">Let Detroit go bankrupt</a>\". And soon, the conversation is flowing as easily as the beer as talk turns to how bad things might have been \u2013 and could yet be \u2013 with Republicans at the helm.</p> <p>Such are the cramped parameters within which Democratic loyalists converse. Questions about poverty, bankers, inequality, climate change or drone attacks are not engaged with a defence of Obama's record on the economy, regulation, the environment or&#xa0;foreign policy but avoided with a threat: Romney. Speculation about what&#xa0;Obama might have done differently are met with arguments about what Bush did do&#xa0;wrong. Inquire if Obama will get more done if elected, and they shrug and point to the obstructionist Republicans in Congress.</p> <p>Dare to prod further as to why anyone should vote for him given the likelihood that Republicans will win in Congress and they'll take you right back where you started: Romney. Any question about the good things that might have happened as a result of Obama's victory in 2008 is short-circuited by a response about the bad things that might happen as a result of his defeat in 2012. Hope curdled to fear. Everyone can tell you how things get worse; no one can tell you how they get better.</p> <p>The paradox of large numbers of people investing heavily in a result without expecting a great deal from the outcome is particularly stark during a presidential election. On the one hand, there is the hoop-la: the polls, bumper stickers, stump speeches, conventions and debates. All the trappings to celebrate the assumed connection between political power and the popular will. On the other hand, there is cynicism: <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/howard-steven-friedman/voter-turnout-europe-america_b_1660271.html\" title=\"\">the low turnout</a>, voter suppression, billionaire donors and contrived controversies. All the evidence of a system corrupted by money and openly rigged .</p> <p>These contradictions are not unique to the US. Britain is midway through its&#xa0;conference season, where the three main parties lay out their stalls. They have fewer members combined, <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21563715\" title=\"\">the Economist reminded</a> us recently, than the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. Yet we treat their annual gatherings as though they are moments of major national significance.</p> <p>But they are particularly acute here because of the dislocation between rhetoric and reality, pageantry and practice, and the nation's belief in its own democratic values and its actual plutocratic electoral culture. And they are particularly acute now. Obama ran&#xa0;on change \u2013 a phenomenon that American elections are not equipped to deliver.</p> <p>How could they? They adhere to the golden rule that those who have the gold make the rules. That has long been a problem. In 2008, Obama and his Republican challenger, John McCain, spent as much on television ads in Florida as all the parties spent on the entire 2010 UK general election. Now it's&#xa0;even worse. A few years ago the supreme court loosened the rules to allow <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/jan/29/us-politics-vote-money-wins\" title=\"\">unlimited donations from anonymous sources</a>. Now the candidates spend almost as much time courting the&#xa0;rich as they do on the stump. \"It's really sad,\" Arnold Hiatt, a key Democratic funder, <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/08/27/120827fa_fact_mayer?currentPage=all\" title=\"\">told the New Yorker</a>. \"You&#xa0;could buy this election for a&#xa0;billion dollars.\"</p> <p>While this makes a mockery of democracy it doesn't create an illusion of choice. The outcome in these elections matter. Hanging chads and slender margins notwithstanding, by the end of the night on 6 November, either Obama or Romney will be president. There are other candidates. But that is the electoral choice. It is not a marginal one.</p> <p>The case against the Republicans is not difficult to make. Their numbers don't add up, their arguments don't make sense, and their record in office contradicts virtually every one of their professed principles. During the eight years prior to Obama's presidency they ballooned the deficit, crashed the economy, increased the power of the state over the individual, and sent America's standing plummeting throughout the world. They built that.</p> <p>The world is not marginally different because George W Bush won in 2000 or 2004. Romney is running to the right of&#xa0;him and Obama is running to the left of Al Gore.</p> <p>Insisting it makes no difference who wins is not tenable. Last year Chelsea Shinneman of Roanoke, Virginia, had a baby, Harrison, who was born with a congenital heart defect. Were it not for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/oct/03/younge-america-obamacare-health-insurance-video\" title=\"\">the new healthcare act</a>, Harrison would have been destined for a lifetime of sky\u2011high insurance premiums.</p> <p>In Fort Collins, Colorado, the head of the Homelessness Prevention Initiative, Sue Beck-Ferkiss, could point to 36 families in the area who had been helped by stimulus money. Had there been any Latinos at the table in Akron, they might have added to Obama's achievements his executive order to halt&#xa0;the deportation of young undocumented immigrants. Had there been soldiers, they might have talked about the withdrawal of combat troops from Iraq.</p> <p>So it matters who wins. Just because improvements are incremental rather than transformative doesn't mean they're not important. The problem isn't that there's no difference between Obama and Romney but that there is insufficient difference between what Obama has delivered and is offering and what the country needs at a time when poverty is rising, wages have stalled, civil liberties have been suppressed, kill lists drawn up and drone attacks escalated. It is possible to indict the Republican party and vote for Obama without endorsing his record or making excuses for his failures.</p> <p>But it is not possible to understand his failures without recognising that an electoral system funded by the wealthy will never be capable of distributing resources and power equitably, regardless of who is in charge. Why would it? How could it? The fact that this is the choice Americans are faced with doesn't mean they don't deserve a better one. It simply reflects why, under these terms, a better choice is not possible.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/garyyounge\" title=\"\"><em>@garyyounge</em></a></p>",
  "<p>David Cameron likes risks. On his second day as Tory leader, 7 December 2005, he took one of his biggest. In that now-distant era, Tony Blair was prime minister: not as dominant as he had been for the previous decade, but still formidable in the Commons, where he had seen off four of Cameron's predecessors with patronising politeness and lawyerly precision.</p> <p>Yet Cameron <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaG2dimIMzY\" title=\"\">used his first prime minister's questions to mount a surprise frontal assault</a>. After a few minutes of mild back-and-forth, with Blair seeking to settle once more into his accustomed role as the only grownup in the room,a smiling Cameron, looking leaner than he does these days, switched suddenly from consensual to mocking. \"It's only our first exchange,\" he said, \"and already the prime minister is asking me the questions.\" Then Cameron leaned showily forward across the despatch box, and said with careful emphasis: \"He was the future once.\"</p> <p>That such a lethal soundbite might backfire one day was lost amid the triumphant Tory laughter. Blair sat listening to the uproar with a fixed smile, and for the rest of prime minister's questions spoke untypically fast. He seemed rattled. In the Commons and beyond, there was a sense that a new political star had announced himself. \"David Cameron was clever and people-friendly, and I thought he had some real steel to him,\" Blair wrote later in his memoirs about Cameron's performance as opposition leader.</p> <p>In fact, some have marked Cameron for greatness ever since Margaret Thatcher was premier. Two years ago, in a Sunday Telegraph article headlined <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/election-2010/7664461/David-Cameron-born-to-be-prime-minister.html\" title=\"\">\"David Cameron: born to be prime minister\"</a>, the authoritative Tory-watcher Matthew d'Ancona recalled that in the late 80s, \"A mutual friend ... told me about the young hot-shot at [Conservative] Central Office who 'will be Tory leader one day'. This was taken as read in his [Cameron's] circle.\"</p> <p>In 2003, after barely two years as an MP, Cameron began to be publicly promoted by seasoned Conservatives and political journalists as the long-awaited Tory equivalent of Blair. As Cameron became opposition leader and then, almost immediately, prime minister-in-waiting, expectations rose further. He would be <a href=\"http://images.spectator.co.uk/essays/14269/part_2/the-next-tory-prime-minister.thtml\" title=\"\">\"one of the most important politicians of the early 21st century\"</a>, wrote the veteran rightwing commentator Bruce Anderson in the Spectator. <a href=\"http://journalisted.com/alan-watkins?allarticles=yes\" title=\"\">\"Cameron is the most immediately likable leader of a Conservative opposition since Stanley Baldwin [in the 20s],\"</a> wrote Anderson's centre-left equivalent, the late Alan Watkins, in the Independent on Sunday. Michael Cockerell, the revered political documentary-maker, made a 2007 BBC2 film titled David Cameron's Incredible Journey.</p> <p>His failure to win the 2010 election suggested this potential might have been a little overstated. But his seemingly assured role in forming and managing the coalition, and the smoothness of his first months in office, convinced most of the commentariat that the election had been an aberration. <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/john-rentoul/john-rentoul-like-it-or-not-cameron-is-a-born-leader-2164289.html\" title=\"\">\"Like it or not, Cameron is a born leader,\" ran the headline of a December 2010 Independent piece by Blair's biographer John Rentoul.</a> As prime minister, wrote Rentoul, \"Cameron has two outstanding qualifications ... His convictions are adaptable ... [and] he is very polite.\" Thanks to \"the effortlessness with which he plays the part of national leader ... How quickly we [have become] used to David Cameron in No 10.\"</p> <p>To underline how many New Labour figures admired and feared Cameron, Rentoul quoted a recent BBC interview with Blair's former home secretary John Reid. Cameron, Reid said, was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/mobile/uk-politics-11992177\" title=\"\">\"a better prime minister than he was leader of the opposition\"</a>, \"successful\" and \"astute\". With Ed Miliband \u2013 it seemed then \u2013 shakily installed as Labour leader, and voters widely assumed to be deeply weary of his party, the Westminster consensus in 2010 and for much of 2011 was that Cameron would get two terms as prime minister, if not more.</p> <p>There had been hints even before the election that the Conservatives were thinking along those lines. In 2008, Francis Maude, then the head of a high-profile, faintly hubristic Tory \"implementation unit\", working out in advance precisely how his party would govern, told the Independent: <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/camerons-first-100-days-882617.html\" title=\"\">\"We have a vision of how Britain can be. It will take a long time to deliver it.\"</a> In 2009, Cameron told SunTalk, a short-lived internet radio spinoff of the Sun, \"We need a government acting for the long term ... with a five- to 10-year horizon.\" A key former Cameron adviser says: \"He really admires Margaret Thatcher, rather than Blair, as an achiever [in office]. Blair didn't think about changing the national culture. David wants to change Britain.\"</p> <p>How misplaced much of this confidence and praise, how distant his first slick phase, seems now. His political arc has turned downward. In the Sun, always sniffing for political winners and losers, he is <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/2385568/Cameron-talks-to-Suns-Gaunty.html\" title=\"\">\"struggling David Cameron\"</a>. In the Mail on Sunday in May, even before this summer and autumn's anti-Cameron plots and government calamities, he was \"a wounded PM\". In the Sunday Times last month, the well-connected rightwing columnist Martin Ivens reported: <a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/comment/columns/martinivens/article1121767.ece\" title=\"\">\"Tory loyalists and critics alike increasingly fear that David Cameron is a loser ... real doubts have taken hold that Cameron can win the next election.\"</a> In the current issue of the Tory journal the Spectator, a cover article by the editor Fraser Nelson is more definite: \"Drift and disillusionment will lose Cameron the next election,\" runs the headline. \"Dave's going down.\"</p> <p>Some of his problems are big \u2013 the recession, the deficit, the polls, the collapse of the plan to redraw parliamentary constituencies in his party's favour, the Boris bandwagon, the maturing of Miliband, the growing popularity of Ukip, the upcoming trials of Cameron's friends and allies from News International. Some of his problems are small \u2013 his increasingly noted tendency to redden when angry, his stumbles <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcdpMxkyk38\" title=\"\">on the David Letterman Show last month</a>, his reputation for \"chillaxing\" too much with DVD boxed sets and games of Fruit Ninja. What is ominous is the way all these issues are beginning to interact and reinforce each other. Fruit Ninja, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/9000253/David-Cameron-interview-those-who-work-hard-will-be-rewarded.html\" title=\"\">he unwisely confided to the Telegraph in January</a>, during a brief uptick in the polls, is \"quite good to get your frustration out. If you can't have a reshuffle, play Fruit Ninja.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397259607\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/5/1349457312431/Calm-down-dear-Cameron-at-010.jpg\" alt=\"Calm down, dear: Cameron at prime minister's questions.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Calm down, dear: Cameron at prime minister's questions. Photograph: PA</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At prime minister's questions these days, Cameron is a less commanding presence. A kind of stutter has crept into his voice \u2013 \"Let me, let me, let me explain what this reshuffle is all about ...\" \u2013 and an anger chokes what used to be languid dismissals of Miliband \u2013 \"Let me tell <em>him</em> what is<em> actually happening</em> in our economy!\" While he leans an elbow on the despatch box with his old insouciance, his other arm often makes a downward, stabbing gesture to emphasise his point, one rigid finger out.</p> <p>All prime ministers ultimately fray and weaken. But Cameron has done so fast: \"His shelf life has narrowed incredibly,\" says Tim Bale of the University of London, a historian of the modern Conservative party and its troubled post-Thatcher leaders. John Curtice of the University of Strathclyde, a leading authority on voter attitudes, says: \"People used to think Cameron was charismatic. But he is proving to be a kind of average prime minister. His ratings are not terrible, but he's not Thatcher, he's not Blair. He is not a dominant figure. Nobody loves him. That is why the Boris story is taking off.\"</p> <p>All prime ministers have internal enemies and critics, but Cameron's are tellingly ready to speak out. From Nadine Dorries's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17815769\" title=\"\">\"arrogant posh boy\"</a> jibe to Stewart Jackson putting Cameron <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/politics/4298979/Egg-on-face-for-David-Cameron-in-elections-egg-on-shoulder-for-Ed-Miliband.html\" title=\"\">\"on notice\"</a> after the Conservatives' poor May local election results, government MPs openly attack the prime minister with a frequency that Blair \u2013 with his proper electoral mandates \u2013 never suffered. The Tory blogger Iain Dale says: \"Nobody's really frightened of No 10.\"</p> <p>Even during Cameron's ascendant period, his circle of able intimates always felt smaller than Blair's. Now, with his policy guru Steve Hilton absent much of the time on an ambiguous \"sabbatical\" in California, and his spin doctor Andy Coulson lost to the phone-hacking scandal, Cameron is served by a No 10 that many observers of Whitehall consider underpowered or even chaotic. \"David is not an intellectual,\" says his former adviser. \"A bit of slackness and complacency can creep in. He is coasting a bit now.\"</p> <p>There are also wider and deeper reasons for his changed fortunes. Governments are unpopular across the west, and have been since the financial crisis abruptly ended the long 90s and noughties boom in 2008. At first, as centre-left administrations such as Gordon Brown's struggled and fell, it was commonly believed \u2013 not least by many Conservatives \u2013 that rightwing parties would benefit. That conclusion looks shakier now. Cameron's close ally, the centre-right French president Nicolas Sarkozy, lost power in May; even the formidable German centre-right chancellor Angela Merkel is beginning to look vulnerable in the polls. Austerity policies, initially popular while still largely theoretical, as they were for Cameron in 2010 and early 2011, in practice are proving electorally toxic for almost all incumbents.</p> <p>For Bale, Cameron's party has a particular weakness too. The Conservatives have not won a general election for more than 20 years. \"The party is still stranded too far to the right from where most voters want them to be on public services and the economy. There is an absolutely clear consensus among academics that the Conservatives didn't win the election because ... they scared too many people. In government, they have proved to these people that their fears were well-founded.\" Max Wind-Cowie, head of the Progressive Conservatism Project at the think-tank Demos, agrees: \"In many ways Cameron has transformed the Conservatives \u2013 for example, Tory MP's now look and feel more like the rest of us \u2013 but the one thing he didn't do was rethink economically.\" Cameron retains a Thatcherite faith in the free market; since the financial crisis began, it has felt more and more out of date, given all the market meltdowns and \"the public's quite sudden distrust of the neoliberal economic project\". His desire to shrink the state, similarly, has come up against voters' stubborn fondness for big state institutions such as the NHS: \"The right of the party need to accept that the public are not just one snappy libertarian argument away from telling the state to bugger off.\"</p> <p>And then there are Cameron's well-fed features and inherited wealth, his elite education and grand family connections; his easy manner and 90s career in public relations, perhaps that more comfortable decade's archetypal business; and the fact that he spent his first three years as Tory leader arguing that Britain's economic problems were largely solved, while promising that as prime minister he would match the Labour public spending he now condemns as profligate. It is not the best persona and CV for an austerity prime minister. For all his hairshirt talk \u2013 expect more in his almost make-or-break speech to the Conservative conference on Wednesday \u2013 Cameron often feels like the last major politician of the boom years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397259608\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/5/1349457411150/With-fellow-Tory-and-riva-010.jpg\" alt=\"With fellow Tory and rival Boris Johnson.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With fellow Tory and rival Boris Johnson. Photograph: Yui Mok</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yui Mok</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How long has he got left? \"You would expect the coalition to survive until 2015,\" says Curtice, \"except for\" \u2013 he cites the famous phrase from Harold Macmillan, the previous Old Etonian prime minister, for the inevitability of political shocks \u2013 \"events, dear boy\". Boris Johnson is scheduled to speak at the Tory conference today and tomorrow. Next month is the Corby byelection, the first in a Conservative seat since the general election \u2013 the absence of such awkward contests has been a characteristic piece of Cameron luck \u2013 and Labour are likely to win it. If that happens, a workable Labour-led coalition government becomes theoretically possible, involving the Liberal Democrats, the Greens, Plaid Cymru and Labour's traditional Ulster allies. While Nick Clegg remains Lib Dem leader that is hard to envisage, but as Stephen Tall of the website Liberal Democrat Voice puts it: <a href=\"http://www.libdemvoice.org/\" title=\"\">\"Lib Dems are starting to look post-Clegg and post-Cameron.\"</a></p> <p>Tall suggests that thoughts may become deeds if the Lib Dems are still dismally unpopular in 2014. That pre-general election year also brings the European elections: a common current prediction is that the Conservatives will come third behind Labour and Ukip. Such a surge by the latter, warns Dale, could permanently \"pull away enough Conservative voters\" to make a Tory general election majority almost impossible. It is already much less likely than many people realise. According to Curtice, depending on how the Lib Dems do, the Conservatives need between 6% and 10% more votes than Labour to win outright. Yet in most polls the Tories are at least 10% behind. \"People in the party are very realistic about the chances of winning the next election,\" says Wind-Cowie. \"They see the chances as marginal at best.\"</p> <p>If Cameron is not prime minister after the general election, says Bale, \"he's toast\". His lack of political obsessiveness \u2013 his <a href=\"http://www.harpercollins.co.uk/Titles/66214\" title=\"\">biographers Francis Elliott and James Hanning</a> note scant political activity until well into his 20s \u2013 and of a large support base in the party make it unlikely he would battle on as a defeated Conservative leader.</p> <p>A second Lib Dem-Tory coalition, says Bale, would probably enable Cameron to cling to office. But everyone I spoke to agreed that it would be far harder to sell to both parties than the 2010 version. A Conservative minority government might in some ways be better for Cameron: \"The more precarious,\" says Bale, \"the less likely a leadership challenge.\" Yet neither would be a glorious outcome for <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/election/article-1272398/GENERAL-ELECTION-2010-David-Cameron-admits-heir-Blair-branding-mistake.html\" title=\"\">\"the heir to Blair\"</a>, as Cameron called himself when campaigning for the party leadership in October 2005.</p> <p>And, given that the Lib Dems are likely to lose seats to Labour in 2015, both outcomes would almost certainly require the Tories to gain seats overall \u2013 not something any British government has achieved for three decades, since Margaret Thatcher's great success in 1983. That victory was made possible by the Falklands war, the foundation of the SDP, Michael Foot's frail Labour leadership, a partial but dramatic economic revival, and a crusading, crisis-hungry prime minister \u2013 an almost freakish combination of factors that feels close to unrepeatable.</p> <p>Yet Thatcher's recovery from her nadir in 1981, when a struggling economy and misfiring austerity policies made her far more personally unpopular than Cameron is now, convinces some Conservative strategists to this day that any mid-term problems can be overcome. \"That's the Tory party's problem \u2013 1979-1983 is the script they're still following,\" says Bale.</p> <p>Cameron does have some Thatcher qualities. \"He is best in a crisis. He can do the high-wire business,\" says his former adviser. Elliott and Hanning describe Cameron's behaviour the morning after the 2010 election, as news of his party's potentially fatal electoral shortfall spread: \"'He had to think very quickly how he and George [Osborne] were going to get out of this alive,'\" said a friend ... But since things were in flux there was still a chance to shape events.\"</p> <p>As Thatcher did, Cameron is also reshaping the country. \"Education, welfare, the NHS \u2013 these are huge, huge programmes of reform,\" says Wind-Cowie. It may be that Cameron is beginning to see these as his goals instead of a second or third term. His former adviser remembers: \"I asked him once what he would like to have achieved as prime minister, when he looks back, and he said: 'I would rather be in for one term if it meant we could reform welfare and education.'\"</p> <p>In politics, as elsewhere, people often conceive of the future as simply an extension of the recent past. Back in 2005, when Cameron became Tory leader, that meant Blair and Thatcher and whole decades of near-impregnable single-party rule. Now we are in a different world. The last time British politics was this turbulent, between the mid-60s and the mid-70s, the central figure was the Labour prime minister Harold Wilson: charming, telegenic, slippery, lazy, plotted against, despised by many in his own party. Remind you of anyone? Wilson somehow won four general elections.</p>",

Many Western countries are slipping back as emerging economies push ahead with energy and drive. Some will make the transition to this.

We know a little more about Benjamin Disraeli, a great Conservative Prime Minister, than he does. Disraeli was defined by changing his party for the late 19th century while Ed Miliband will be defined by refusing to change his Party for the 21st century.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Hague said the British people had \"firmly made up their minds that they do not want to become part of some kind of European federation\".</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that he would announce further details of his review of EU powers (the \"balance of competencies\" review) later this month.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the Tories want to negotiate a new settlement with the EU and then secure public support for that.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In our party we are looking towards the establishment of a new settlement in Europe, and that will in time mean, just as it will for other nations of Europe in or out of the Eurozone, a big choice for Britain which must be a real choice for Britain and which will require the fresh consent of the British people.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that Britain would launch a major crackdown on sexual violence in conflict during its presidency of the G8 next year.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are doing this because of the 50,000 women raped in Bosnia, who have only seen thirty of the men responsible ever convicted for it, because of 64,000 women and girls raped in Sierra Leone and 400,000 in Rwanda, because of all those in Colombia, Darfur, Liberia and the Democratic Republic of Congo who endured this unthinkable violation, and for all the men and boys who have also been subjected to rape in conflict and have never known justice for it.</p> <p>For them and for millions like them who might be affected in the future, it is time to shatter this impunity. It is time to make it possible to mount many more successful prosecutions. The specialist team we are assembling will be ready for deployment by the end of this year, and we will call on other nations to join us in giving the UN and other agencies the support they need. I hope that across this party and across all parties people will join me in this campaign and take it to their hearts so that we can create a momentum that cannot be stopped and a lasting step forward in the condition of humanity.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said new funding being announced shortly would safeguard the future of Bletchley Park.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Next week I will go to Bletchley Park to announce the unlocking of funding for its restoration, to preserve the memory of some of the greatest intelligence achievements in our history and at the same time launch new schemes to recruit the brightest mathematicians of the future.

Thanks to our prime minister we have the strength to take the tough decisions that this country needs to succeed.</p> <p>&#xa0;But Labour today is not one of those parties. It has a shadow chancellor who would bankrupt the country again with more spending, more borrowing and more debt, it has trade unions that are running amok again, and a leader that is not strong enough to control any of them.</p> <p>&#xa0;Last week he made claim to be Disraeli. We know a little more about Benjamin Disraeli, a great Conservative prime minister, than he does. Disraeli was defined by changing his party for the late 19th century while Ed Miliband will be defined by refusing to change his party for the 21st century. Disraeli believed in fiscal discipline, in self-reliance, in building on historic strengths, in this country paying its way and in taxes being kept down. He was no deficit spender, but was careful to budget for a surplus.</p> <p>To borrow a turn of phrase, we were led by Disraeli, our predecessors knew Disraeli, Disraeli\u2019s beliefs were Conservative through and through, and, Ed Miliband, you are no Disraeli.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507194fb58f93d33437541d7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-07T14:43:07.537Z\">3.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>William Hague has quickly turned away from foreign affairs and he is now bashing Labour.</p> <p>There are few people who can thump the political tub as boldly as Hague, and this is vintage stuff.

My colleague Polly Toynbee was left out in the cold, something an ungallant Montgomerie gleefully pointed out to his fellow Tories.</p> <p>Montgomerie made his case that the Conservatives have a mountain to climb to win the next election. The party had not won an outright majority for 20 years, and no government in modern times had added to their vote share while being in power, he said. This was something neither Margaret Thatcher nor Tony Blair had ever done, and the Tories today had to do it \"after making deeper spending cuts than Thatcher ever managed\".</p> <p>The answer, according to Montgomerie, was to \"look like we are on the side of ordinary, striving, blue-collar working people\". On immigration, Europe and crime \"the British people stand with us already\", but \"we need to be a party that is equally committed to Britain's social contract: the NHS, looking after pensioners, a safety net.\"</p> <p>He added: \"We need to be a little bit like Tony Blair - constantly invading other people's territory. I don't mean Iran, I mean political territory.\"</p> <p>But as the klaxons, cheers and boos of a nearby anti-government rally threatened to drown out the speakers, the man who really electrified the crowd was from the other side of the political divide: Marcus Roberts of the Fabian Society, who said that if the Tories want to win the next election \"you're going to need to address the [EU] referendum question\".</p> <p>And he added threateningly: \"If you aren't doing that positively, just watch for us [Labour] to do so, because we will be that ruthless and we will do what it takes in order to win.\"</p> <p>He said that there was a \"moral argument\" to holding a referendum based on the changing face of Europe since the eurozone crisis and a \"bureaucratic lack of legitimacy\".</p> <p>David Davis, David Cameron's former leadership rival and a voice of the right, couldn't agree more: \"Europe is going through a massive transition at the moment,\" he said, \"towards something we don't really want to be a part of: a superstate. We want to have a relationship with them, but we have to make a decision [on whether to be part of such a superstate].\"</p> <p>Davis said he backed holding two referendums. The first would ask the British public what they wanted out of Europe. This result would then be taken by \"negotiators\" to Brussels, and what the negotiators came up with would be put to the public. All this had to start before the next election, because \"I don't think promising a referendum will win us 10 votes in the next election - because nobody believes us any more.\"</p> <p>The case was most vividly put by the delegate who asked Chris Grayling, the justice secretary, to take a message back to Cameron: \"People that I meet believe that politicians are spitting in the face of the country over Europe,\" he said. \"They want a referendum and they are being denied it.\"</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PaulTOwen/status/254929981166211072\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Tim Montgomerie, Chris Grayling and David Davis at the Tory conference <a href=\"http://t.co/7L9D3Qz2\" title=\"http://twitter.com/PaulTOwen/status/254929981166211072/photo/1\">twitter.com/PaulTOwen/stat\u2026</a></p>&mdash; PaulTOwen (@PaulTOwen) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulTOwen/status/254929981166211072\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-07T13:03:39+00:00\">October 7, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-07T15:05:59.697Z\">at 4.05pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50717b1758f93d33437541cf\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-07T12:59:37.726Z\">1.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Lunchtime summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>\u2022 David Cameron and George Osborne have sought to defend the Conservative party's \"one nation\" credentials by insisting that the rich will be asked to pay more in the next round of deficit-reduction measures.</strong> The issue has dominated the first morning of a conference which will see the Conservatives contest Labour's claim that it is now the \"one nation\" party. In separate interviews, Cameron and Osborne both said that the Lib Dem demand for a mansion tax, or for a specific tax on wealth, was unacceptable. But, without giving details they suggested that there were other ways of extracting more money from the wealthy and that this would happen before 2015. This is what Osborne told Sky.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u2019re not going to have a new mansion tax, nor do I think it\u2019s sensible to have a wealth tax in the sense of a sort of tax on your wealth levied annually. Other countries have tried that and it hasn\u2019t work, and it\u2019s driven enterprise and investment abroad.</p> <p>So we\u2019re not going to do those two ideas, but I\u2019m very clear that the rich will have to make a contribution to closing the budget deficit; I\u2019m absolutely clear that in the decisions we take in the years ahead, as well as dealing with welfare, as well as continuing to reduce government spending in departments, we are also going to have to ask the rich to make another contribution.</p> </blockquote> <p>Osborne said extra payments would be necessary because the government would have to find savings worth \u00a316bn in the next savings review. In a separate interview, Philip Hammond, the defence secretary, said that Osborne had increased taxes on the rich in every budget he had delivered. But the Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott said that the Tories' decision to rule out a mansion tax was a mistake.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/oakeshottm/status/254884765046550528\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>How do Tories define Middle England?

But he also said he would like to review the rule that allows EU citizens to enter the UK freely. Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, put out this statement afterwards.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Since Cameron has become leader, membership of the Tory party has halved. Since he last abused Ukip, our poll ratings have doubled. The prime minister is once again showing his legendary lofty disdain for ordinary voters who rate Ukip higher than the Lib Dems - who must be an even a bigger waste of his time, obviously.</p> <p>The prime minister's blueprint for a new EU settlement is very confused. His claims to be able to change the EU rules on freedom of movement will be derided by anybody who knows how the EU works.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Philip Hammond, the defence secretary, has described Andrew Mitchell's treatment of police officers at the gate of Downing Street as \"inexcusable\".</strong> Asked about the chief whip, who is not attending the conference because the controversy is still attracting media attention, Hammond said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Every time any individual slips up, steps out of line, does something they shouldn't have done, commits an indiscretion, and they are a member of a party or an organisation, of course that is bound to reflect on that organisation. We have to accept that, it is very unfortunate. Nobody is defending Andrew Mitchell's conduct but a line now has to be drawn under it. This has been a very damaging affair.</p> </blockquote> <p>Tim Loughton, a former minister, said the affair had been \"hugely and deeply damaging\" to the party.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Council leaders have expressed some concerns about the government's decision to spend money on another council tax freeze.</strong> (See 9.07am.) The Conservative-led Local Government Association put out a statement saying that the freeze would not address councils' long-term funding problems, that councils should decide their own council tax rates and that Eric Pickles' decision to ban council from raising council tax by more than 2% without a referendum undermines the government's commitment to localism. In a statement Sir Merrick Cockell, the LGA chairman, said that help for councils was \"a good thing\" but that there were problems with this offer.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Reducing the current referendum trigger from 3.5 per cent to 2 per cent represents less flexibility for councils and even less localism with Whitehall decreeing what constitutes excessive. If local referendums are to be truly localist, they should be triggered by local people who can determine whether a council tax increase is excessive or not.</p> <p>Any help for councils is a good thing, but we have to be clear that this is a short-term offer. It doesn't address the huge long term pressures councils are facing including bigger cuts than any other part of the public sector and an immediate and growing crisis in funding care for the elderly. Councils could now have to budget for a further future shortfall.</p> <p>It is only right that councils take a longer-term view on budget planning and that decisions on the level of council tax are made by councillors who will then rightly be held to account through the ballot box.</p> <p>Councils care for the elderly, look after vulnerable children and collect the bins from our streets and in order to carry on doing this effectively local authorities need local discretion to consider the long-term interests of their residents before deciding if they will take up this government offer.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Cameron has defended the government's decision not to rush the review of airport capacity.</strong> Boris Johnson has claimed that delaying a decision about a new airport could have catastrophic consequences. Cameron said that Johnson was \"perfectly entitled\" to his view but that the government disagreed.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We made a promise about the third runway in this parliament; we\u2019re keeping that promise, but we need now a proper review to see what the right answer is for the long-term interests of this country. This is a decision we\u2019ll have to live with for decades, and so let\u2019s take the time, let\u2019s get it right.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cameron also said that he would like Johnson to do another political job after he steps down as mayor of London. (See 12.18pm.)</p> <p><strong>\u2022 The Department for Transport has said that 250,000 season ticket holders could save an extra \u00a345 as a result of the government's decision to impose a new cap on rail fares.</strong> Here's an extract from<a href=\"http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/press-dft-20121007a/\"> its news release.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Passengers will benefit from a two per cent cut to the planned rises in the cost of nationwide train travel and travel on London buses and tubes following today\u2019s announcement by prime minister David Cameron.</p> <p>The average increase in regulated rail fares and the cost of travel on London\u2019s buses and tube network will be limited to one per cent above inflation for 2013 and 2014. Fares had been due to increase by RPI+3 per cent.</p> <p>&#xa0;This is expected to benefit more than a quarter of a million annual season ticket holders who can expect to have an extra \u00a345 back in their pockets as a result of today's decision. Many more holders of weekly and monthly season tickets could also see lower fares and some commuters will be over \u00a3200 better off over the two years.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-07T13:30:39.943Z\">at 2.30pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50717b0dc0e3aacd18e2f84a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-07T12:52:29.966Z\">1.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-6777bdc2-f8cb-4640-bc5a-26208ab267a0\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/7/1349613908044/3112472b-67b2-46ca-beb1-c268c7776ead-460.jpeg\" alt=\"samantha cameron \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photographers have been focusing on the most contentious issue of the day, Samantha Cameron's choice of footwear.

I have taken some of the quotes from the Press Association and from <a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com\">PoliticsHome.</a></p> <p><strong>\u2022 Cameron said that the wealthy would be asked to pay more in tax.</strong> Although the Tories are rejecting a wealth tax of the kind proposed by the Lib Dems (see 9.07am), they are prepared to make the wealthy pay more in tax. Andrew Marr said that, at the Lib Dem conference, Nick Clegg said that the wealthy would have to pay more as their contribution to getting the deficit under control. Marr asked if there would be any new measures that would hit wealthier taxpayers. Cameron replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We will make sure that the rich pay their fair share, that the burden is properly shared \u2026 I'm not going to announce the measures here on the programme, but we will always be fair and seen to be fair.</p> </blockquote> <p>So, people who are the wealthiest will pay more in tax before the election Marr said. Cameron replied: \"Yes. And it is happening already.\"</p> <p>\u2022 But Cameron said he would veto a mansion tax.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don't actually believe we should be a country where if you work hard, you save, you buy yourself a house, you try to pay down the mortgage, you save and invest into that house, I don't want to be a country that comes after you every year with a massive great tax. So that is not going to happen.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the wealthy were now paying a greater percentage of the total amount of income tax paid to the Exchequer than they did under Labour.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said he would keep the promise he made at the election to protect universal benefits for pensioners.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Let me be absolutely clear, the promise that I made at the last election to Britain's pensioners when I said we are not going to take away your winter fuel allowance, your free TV licences, your free bus passes - that promise stands.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that he would like Boris Johnson to do another job in politics after he stands down as London mayor.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have said to Boris: 'Once you have done your job as London Mayor, don't think your job in politics is over'. I think he has got a huge amount to offer, a huge amount to give and I encourage him to do that. I think it is great that the greatest city in the world has got such a good mayor.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><strong>\u2022 He said Labour had \"nothing to say about the deficit or debt\" at its conference last week.</strong></strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He played down the prospect of holding an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the EU.</strong> Instead, he said that he wanted \"a new settlement\" with Europe and that the government should gain \"consent\" for that settlement.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The trouble with a straight yes-or-no [referendum] is that, frankly, I am not happy with the status quo, so I don't want to say Yes to the status quo, but I also don't think it would be right to leave now.</p> <p>I think most people in our country don't want to leave the EU or just accept how it is at the moment. They want a change now. I want a change now. A Conservative-only government after the next general election can go and change it, can have that renegotiation.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><strong>\u2022 He said that Ukip was \"a complete waste of time\".</strong></strong></p> <p><strong><strong>\u2022 He said he was in favour of a review of the rules allowing immigrations from the rest of the EU free entry into the UK.</strong></strong> Free movement of labour is at the heart of the EU, but in an interview in the Sunday Telegraph Theresa May, the home secretary, said she would review this. (See 9.07am.) Cameron said he was in favour of this. The review would be part of the \"balance of competencies\" review looking at EU powers, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think you ought to go through all of the things that we have in our relationship with Europe, and work out what is good for Britain, work out what we can do better, and work out what we want to change, and I think by all means look at that. Look, I believe in the single market, I believe in free movement, but two weeks ago, I visited two factories in a week, and I asked the question, \u2018how many people do you employ from other EU countries? What\u2019s the balance?\u2019. In one it was 60%, in the other it was 50%. Now heavens above, we have got so many unemployed people in our country that we want to train and educate and give apprenticeships to and get back into work. I think it\u2019s absolutely right to look at this balance of competencies, to go through every topic and see what is in Britain\u2019s interests.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said he would veto a \"massive\" increase in the EU's budget.</strong></p> <p><strong><strong>\u2022 He said that eventually the EU would need two budgets; one for countries in the Eurozone, and one for countries outside.</strong></strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He suggested that he was likely to implement the recommendations of the Leveson report on press regulation.</strong> Marr said that in the past Cameron had said that, as long as the recommendations weren't \"bonkers\", he would implement them. Was that still the case? \"Absolutely,\" said Cameron. But when he was pressed to say that he would accept statutory regulation of the press if Leveson recommended it, he refused to give an explicit commitment.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We must wait for what Lord Justice Leveson says. I don\u2019t want to try and prejudge it \u2026 We don't want heavy-handed state intervention; we\u2019ve got to have a free press \u2026 We\u2019re hoping Lord Leveson is going to crack this problem for us, but we must let him do his work first.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the government had no plans to hold a vote on cutting the time limit for an abortion.</strong> Asked about Jeremy Hunt's interview on this subject yesterday, in which the health secretary said he was in favour of cutting the limit to 12 weeks, Cameron said that Hunt was just answering a question, not trying to put the issue on the agenda.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Hunt] was asked a question because he previously voted for a 12-week limit and he said he has stuck to that view. It is a vote of conscience issue and the health secretary is quite entitled to have his own opinion, but it is not the Government's approach.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cameron said that he personally favoured a \"modest\" reduction in the current 24-week limit but that the government did not have any plans to bring forward legislation on this issue.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said it was \"too early to say\" whether the government would miss its target to have debt falling by the time of the next election.</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-07T11:44:43.817Z\">at 12.44pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5071605ac0e3aacd18e2f845\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-07T10:59:58.171Z\">11.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There are some <a href=\"http://ftlisting.salespack.conservativepartyconference.com/admin\">amusingly named fringe events</a> at the Tory conference, reports <strong>Paul Owen</strong>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Probably the most blue in tooth and claw is tomorrow at 9am, and is baldly called: \"Why the public should want hospitals to close.\" For sheer mad brio \"We can't afford roads!\" (Tuesday, 5.30pm, their exclamation mark) runs it close.</p> <p>Also tomorrow morning Maria Miller, the new culture secretary and women's minister, is billed as speaking at the metaphysical-sounding \"Multi-dimensional poverty: how can we improve the measurements?\"</p> <p>Female delegates worried about the government's failure to win over women voters might be interested in \"The sharp end of the Chardonnay: how things have changed for women who drink\" at 12.30pm tomorrow.</p> <p>But most Tories have something more important on their minds: the EU. \"We need to talk about Europe\" (11am tomorrow) does battle with \"We need to talk about Brussels\" (7.30pm the same day), while \"How Britain can exit the EU\" and \"Back off Brussels!\" are also on the fringe agenda - although ominously an event explaining \"Britain, the eurozone crisis and the future of Europe\" has been cancelled.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-3c374a6c-cb61-44ca-a37d-7cdb949c5bce\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/7/1349609886707/bddb5eae-105e-494f-9cf3-24cd3f62343f-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Roads\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roads \u2013 can we afford them?

He is not a forecaster, but he thinks the economy is rebalancing. A million net new jobs have been created in the private sector. Britain is exporting more things.</p> <p>Last year more businesses were set up than in any recent year in our history.</p> <p>A global race is underway. Some countries will make it and some won't, he says.</p> <p><em>Q: But debt is going up. When will you get on top of that?</em></p> <p>Cameron says he inherited a deficit of around 11%. It is now around 8%.

They calculate that the party\u2019s true level of support could be five points or more above what headline figures suggest.</p> <p>Second, they are confident that incumbency gives them an advantage. Their analysis of the last Election result shows sitting MPs tended to be insulated against the national swing.</p> <p>Third, they think they can be more targeted. In 2010, the Tories were trying to take 160 seats. This time, they are looking at just 40. I\u2019m told the list will include more than ten Lib Dem seats.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/daves-best-bet-is-a-repeat-of-the-1983-show-8200651.html\">\u2022 John Rentoul in the Independent on Sunday says he can imagine Cameron winning the next election.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is possible to see how the Prime Minister might still win through, however. It does not really depend on what happens at conference this week, provided it avoids disaster. The winning scenario was painted jointly for me by a minister and a shadow minister, in separate conversations.</p> <p>The Conservative minister asked: \"What if, in a year to 18 months' time, the economy is growing... but the cuts really start to bite?\" That is quite possible, and perhaps the parallel to which this Cameronian moderniser was pointing was Margaret Thatcher in 1983, when unemployment was still high but disposable income rising for the majority. It may seem harsh, but elections can be won even if a minority is suffering.</p> <p>The Shadow Cabinet member then said what the Tory message would be in 2015: \"Labour drove the car into the ditch; do you really want to let them back behind the wheel?\" The higher growth is, the more effective this message is likely to be.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/9591161/The-Man-with-the-Plan-cant-keep-avoiding-the-Blond-One.html\">\u2022 Matthew d'Ancona in the Sunday Telegraph, who interviewed David Cameron this week, says Cameron could be overshadowed at the conference by Boris Johnson.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Throughout our interview, Cameron was visibly focused, poised on the edge of his seat \u2013 except when pressed on what Quentin Tarantino would call the \u201cBoris Situation\u201d, at which point he squirmed and gurned, seeking to end the line of questioning with the usual lines \u2013 \u201cBoris really is Boris\u201d, \u201cthere\u2019s no point trying to contain Boris\u201d, and so on \u2013 and an affable shrug.</p> <p>Sorry, Prime Minister: there\u2019s no point presenting yourself as the Man with the Plan if a hugely popular contender for your job is mysteriously permitted to say that the plan contains the seeds of catastrophe. Jovial appeasement is merely encouraging the Mayor. There is a clear and present danger that he will steal the show from the PM in Birmingham, and that Cameron will start to be seen as yesterday\u2019s tomorrow man, an obstruction to the Blond One\u2019s ascent to power. It should anger the Cameroons much more than it does that all this is so. They need to act, for once, as if they\u2019re mad as hell and they\u2019re not going to take it any more. If No 10 has a Boris Strategy, I can\u2019t see it.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/07/andrew-rawnsley-boris-johnsons-threat-to-cameron\">\u2022 And Andrew Rawnsley in the Observer also says that Johnson will cause problems for Cameron at the conference.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Johnson] will address the conference itself, a glorious opportunity for Borisovian grandstanding and an event that the prime minister will feel painfully obliged to attend. The compliment will not be returned: the mayor will have left Birmingham before Mr Cameron addresses the party. Cabinet ministers have to clear their conference speeches through Number 10. The prime minister's people would very much like to see what Mr Johnson has in store for the conference. One Number 10 aide says: \"He's talked to us about where his speech is going.\" In other words, they don't really have a clue. If it is comedy Boris, he will make the rest of the cabinet look even more cardboard and grey. If it is serious Boris, the would-be prime minister in waiting, that will be really alarming for Number 10.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/comment/columns/martinivens/article1142245.ece\">\u2022 Martin Ivens in the Sunday Times (paywall) says Cameron needs to take Miliband seriously.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Like the American president, Cameron\u2019s vice is to sit back and fritter away his political capital when ahead. He switches the gears too quickly to cruise control. Expect him to come storming back in his own conference speech.</p> <p>Both men are fierce fighters in a tight corner but Obama \u2014 usually \u2014 does \u201cthe vision thing\u201d better than Cameron.

  "<p>When he was leader of the Conservative party, William Hague once likened membership of the euro to being trapped in a burning building with no fire exit. It was an apt description, as young people in Greece would testify: in a country that has already contracted by more than Germany did during the Great Depression, the jobless rate for Greeks under 25 is 55%.</p> <p>Little wonder then that Antonis Samaras, the prime minister of Greece, is warning that his country has been pushed to the limit and that there is, as with Weimar Germany, the risk of democracy collapsing.</p> <p>Little wonder, either, that Spain, only just behind Greece in the youth unemployment misery stakes, is wary of seeking the help offered by the European Central Bank. Unlimited buying of Spanish bonds by the bank will come at a heavy price: more austerity for a population already buckling under the strain.</p> <p>A study of hundreds of recessions dating from the 19th century shows that most are short, sharp affairs. They are like heavy colds, nasty but quickly over. Every now and then, however, the cold turns into something much more serious and the longer it lasts the more serious it gets.</p> <p>It becomes more like a pandemic, affecting the immune systems of economies and spreading from one country to another. That is the situation in the eurozone today.</p> <p>Activity is collapsing in Italy, is weakening fast in France, and has started to falter in Germany. Unemployment in the eurozone is at record levels as the recession starts to feed on itself. Collapsing demand leads to company failures, adding to the bad debt problems of already weak banks. These, in turn, call in loans and make credit harder to find. Government finances suffer, increasing pressure on finance ministries to find additional savings. Another chunk is taken out of demand, making it more difficult to cut budget deficits and the national debt.</p> <p>Europe's malaise is affecting the entire global economy. It is hampering an already tentative US economy and may result in Mitt Romney becoming US president. It is leading to slower growth in China, which in turn is leading to heightened trade tensions.</p> <p>The eurozone has experienced weaker growth in the past decade than Japan did in its lost decade of the 1990s. The gap between the rich and poor countries has widened rather than narrowed. Before long, one in eight working age people will be on the dole. Flows of inward investment to what is increasingly seen as an economic backwater are starting to dry up. The failure of monetary union has been complete and abject.</p> <p>In business this would not matter all that much. Enterprises fail all the time. The commercial world \u2013 with the egregious exception of the \"too big to fail\" banks \u2013 is run on empirical principles: companies that work tend to survive and thrive, while those that don't fall by the wayside.</p> <p>The single currency does not operate by empirical principles. If it did the plug would already have been pulled on it. It is a top-down project, with a lineage stretching back to the Enlightenment, in which technocrats come up with what they see as a blueprint for happiness: clear, rational and beautiful. When the blueprint does not deliver the expected results, that is not the fault of the plan.</p> <p>As made clear this year by the ECB president, Mario Draghi, the future of the euro is not open to negotiation: Europe could have a second or even a third lost decade and it would make no difference to those who think it the last word in modernity.</p> <p>A second lost decade is certainly in prospect. The International Monetary Fund's World Economic Outlook tells the cautionary tale of British economic policy after the first world war, which was similar in many respects to the way the eurozone manages affairs today. When the guns fell silent in November 1918 the UK found the national debt had ballooned to more than 140% of GDP and prices were double their pre-war level. The government had two priorities: to return the pound eventually to the gold standard at its 1914 exchange rate and to cut national debt.</p> <p>The upshot was that both monetary policy (interest rates and the exchange rate) and fiscal policy (taxes and spending) were kept tight. Interest rates were raised to 7% in 1920 and throughout the 1920s the Treasury ran primary budget surpluses (excluding interest payments on the national debt) of nearly 7% of national output.</p> <p>Just as in the eurozone today, great store was put on the notion of an internal devaluation. Britain had become less competitive but could price itself back into global markets through cuts in wages and prices. But as the IMF study notes: \"The combination of tight monetary and tight fiscal policy, aimed at significantly reducing the price level and returning to the pre-war parity, had disastrous outcomes.</p> <p>\"Unemployment was high, growth was low, and, most relevant, debt continued to grow. Although the price-level reduction the UK was attempting to achieve was larger than anything likely to happen today due to internal devaluation, similar dynamics are evident.\"</p> <p>In some respects, the policy regime in the eurozone today is far less draconian than in 1920s Britain. Short-term interest rates have been cut, the ECB has flooded the financial system with cash and it will buy sovereign bonds, albeit with strings attached.</p> <p>In other ways, though, it is the gold standard with knobs on. The standard was, in theory at least, a self-stabilising mechanism, since those countries that ran trade surpluses accumulated gold. This led to an expansion of credit, which in turn led to higher inflation, a drop in competitiveness and a narrowing trade surplus. Today's euro has no such mechanism to force the biggest creditor nation (Germany) to run down its colossal surpluses.</p> <p>The gold standard collapsed in the 1930s amid great economic pressure and Britain was the first country to leave. For those who view the euro with almost religious reverence, the idea that monetary union could go the same way is inconceivable.</p> <p>Let's hope they are wrong. The best thing for Europe would be if the euro were smashed to smithereens, allowing countries to devalue and impose capital controls. It would still be painful but at least they have the ability to boost their economies and pay down debts more slowly. The alternative is to sit and watch the flames lick higher.</p>",
  "<p>US vice-presidential candidates Joe Biden and Paul Ryan are preparing for their televised debate on Thursday with the knowledge that a strong performance during the head-to-head from Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has closed the gap with President Obama to just two points.</p> <p>Polls over the weekend suggest that the White House incumbent maintained an advantage in the race, but one that has been severely eaten into following a lacklustre performance at Wednesday's debate. An Ipsos/Reuters snapshot of voter intention put Obama ahead on 47% to Romney's 45%.</p> <p>Biden and Ryan are cramming on each other's positions on the issues and have taken on mock-opponents in debate camps in preparation for their spot in the national limelight.</p> <p>Already, the Ryan camp has sought to manage predictions. Ryan told reporters last week he expected Biden to come at him like a \"cannonball\", while Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican national committee, said on Sunday he expects the Wisconsin congressman to do well but noted that Biden is a talented debater.</p> <p>\"Paul is a smart guy. He has committed his life to understanding the problems of our economy,\" said Priebus, on CNN's State of The Union. \"I think Paul is going to do a great job, but I think it's important to understand\" Biden is \"a gifted orator\" and \"very good at rhetoric.\"</p> <p>The two men, who vary greatly in experience as well as ideology, will face off for the first time on the public stage on October 11 in Danville, Kentucky, and the stakes are high.</p> <p>Biden, 69, who has served in the Senate for 36 years and run for president twice, is under pressure to make up some of the ground Obama lost in his widely criticised performance on Wednesday. There was surprise that Obama did not employ attacks he has previously used to good effect in campaign ads and while on the road. There was no mention of Romney's ill-advised quip in which he appeared to dismiss 47% of Americans as welfare-takers who believed they are victims, nor the candidate's record at Bain capital.</p> <p>Biden is expected to go after his Republican opponent's key arguments on taxes, entitlement reform and deficit reduction.</p> <p>Ryan also has a tough job ahead of him. At 42, he has 14 years in Congress to Biden's almost four decades and has never debated at a national level. He stands to prove himself as Romney's running mate, while defending his position on taxes.</p> <p>Analysts predict both men will stick to the issues they have discussed on the campaign trail, while fleshing out some of the themes outlining the differences between them highlighted in last week's debate by Obama and Romney.</p> <p>However, they have an additional dimension to consider \u2013 not getting ahead of the boss.</p> <p>Alan Schroeder, a Northeastern University journalism professor and author of the 2008 book Presidential Debates: 50 Years of High-Risk TV, <a href=\"http://www.courier-journal.com/article/20121006/NEWS0106/310060112/Paul-Ryan-Joseph-Biden-prepare-take-Centre-stage-Danville-VP-debate?odyssey=tab|topnews|text|Home\">said, in the Courier-Journal in Kentucky</a>:</p> <p>\"The vice presidential candidates have to be a little careful about not getting in front of the news and not getting in front of their top-of-the-ticket partners.\"</p> <p>This week, Biden has cleared the decks for an intense \"debate camp\" in Wilmington, Delaware. He has so far engaged in two mock debates with Chris Van Hollen, a Democratic representative for Maryland, in the place of Ryan.</p> <p>Ryan ended three days of debate camp in south-west Virginia on Friday, where Ted Olsen, the former US solicitor general, stood in for his Democratic opponent. Playing the role of Martha Raddatz, of ABC, moderator, was Romney's former deputy as governor of Massachusetts, Kerry Healey, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/expectations-run-high-for-biden-ryan-debate/2012/10/06/063d24d8-0ef5-11e2-a310-2363842b7057_story.html\">according to the Washington Post</a>.</p> <p>Biden, who has a reputation for gaffes, told reporters last week that he has been carefully studying Ryan's position on the key issues.</p> <p>\"I just want to make sure that when I say these things, I don't have the congressman saying: 'No no no, I don't have that position,' or, 'That's not the governor's position',\" Biden said. </p> <p>Ryan, who told the Weekly Standard last week he expected Biden to come after him \"like a cannonball\", got his criticism in early, as he said: \"He'll be in full attack mode, and I don't think he'll let any inconvenient facts get in his way.\"</p>",
  "<p>Poinciana sits in the heart of the vote-rich Interstate-4 corridor where the battle for Florida \u2013 and quite possibly the White House itself \u2013 will soon be fought. This is the ultimate swing region, in the ultimate swing state, with Latino voters holding their fingers on the scale.</p> <p>\"The I-4 corridor generally is divided; whichever party can capture the voters generally does well,\" explains David Colburn, director of the Reubin O'D. Askew Institute on Politics and Society at the University of Florida. \"The southeastern part of the state typically votes Democrat, the northern part and significantly the southwest vote Republican.\"</p> <p>Poinciana is a bedroom community of 54,000 residents 20 minutes outside Orlando that started out as a retirement development 40 years ago. But the population here is no longer dominated by older, white retirees. Poinciana went from 65% white in 2000 to 51% Hispanic in 2010. Puerto Ricans make up almost 70% of the community's Hispanic population <a href=\"http://censusviewer.com/city/FL/Poinciana/2000\">with small numbers of Dominicans, Mexicans and Cubans mixed in</a>. These are the voters who could swing the state \u2013 if, that is, they show up to the polls. </p> <p>While Barack Obama can win a second term without a Florida victory, many analysts see no viable path to the White House for Republican challenger Mitt Romney if he loses the Sunshine State. Voters in Puerto Rico tend to favor Democratic candidates over Republican ones, and registration statistics in central Florida reflect this preference.</p> <p>However, almost a third of Hispanic voters here have no political party preference. It is these voters that Obama and Romney need to woo.</p> <p>Bush managed to win 52% of the vote in Poinciana in 2004, but Obama captured nearly 60% in 2008. Some think Romney could have swung Poinciana back to red by choosing the Hispanic Florida senator Marco Rubio as his running mate. Rubio won Poinciana in his 2010 bid for the US Senate, fending off both a Democrat and an independent in a contentious election.</p> <p>But to prevail, Romney will have to overcome the sense of disenfranchisement reflected in low turnout among the region's Hispanic population over the years. Whereas Puerto Rico <a href=\"http://www.homefacts.com/politics/Florida/Osceola-County/Poinciana.html\">enjoys an 80% voter turnout</a>, that number plummets to 17% <a href=\"http://www.eleccionespuertorico.org/2008/electorado.votante.html\">among Puerto Ricans living in Florida</a>.</p> <p>\"There's been very little incentive for candidates to get to know the community issues,\" Anthony Suarez, a Spanish-language radio host said.</p> <h2>'The poster child for the financial crisis'</h2> <p>For now, the economy is the top issue on the minds of residents, whether it be concerns over decreased home values or an unemployment rate above the national average. To win votes here, particularly among the politically disenchanted Puerto Rican population, the candidates' economic message needs to be strong.</p> <p>\"In 2006 we were the fastest-growing development community in the nation with waiting lists for houses and unbelievable growth. But during the 2008 recession Poinciana literally became the poster child for the financial crisis,\" resident Keith Laytham said.</p> <p>The growth was spurred on by a boom in the tourism industry around Orlando in the early 2000s. But people stopped taking expensive vacations when the economy deflated, leaving many of these new Latino arrivals without a job. Many are also under water on their housing, having bought homes at inflated prices that can now not be recouped.</p> <p>Results of a study conducted by the Pew Research Center last year show the median net worth for Hispanic households in Florida dropped by 88% between 2005 and 2009 and the median home value decreased by 72%. Poinciana has some of the highest rates of housing strife in the country \u2013 a quarter of its 24,000 homes have fallen into foreclosure in the last four years. \"You had people buying $250,000 homes at the height of the boom even though the median income in the county was $28,000,\" said Osceola County Commissioner Brandon Arrington. </p> <p>There are signs that the housing market may be bottoming out. And the unemployment rate in the area is finally moving in the right direction after peaking at 11.5% in January 2010, though it <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/eag/eag.fl_orlando_msa.htm\">still remains slightly above the national average</a>.</p> <p>\"It's the regular, working stiffs who are affected when there are cutbacks. The majority of the people here work in the hospitality industry or have construction jobs,\" Poinciana resident Roberto Sanchez said.</p> <p>Sanchez, whose parents are from Puerto Rico, moved to the community eight years ago after losing his job in New Jersey. He was laid off from another construction job at the height of the unemployment crisis but has managed to find work as a quality control technician for an asphalt company.</p> <p>He is frustrated with the stalled economy. \"We don't think the government represents us. I have issues with both sides \u2013 the Democrats because of the unfulfilled promises and the Republicans because it seems they only care about rich, white people.\"</p> <p>Many local Hispanics of Puerto Rican descent feel they are treated as second-class citizens by both parties. \"If you go with the Republicans, you're going to be second class to the Cubans. If you go with the Democrats, you're going to be second to the African American community,\" Suarez said.</p> <p>Overall, though, Suarez sees a contrast between the two main parties ahead of the presidential election. \"Right now the Republicans are doing everything they can to ensure Poinciana stays Democrat and the Democrats are doing everything they can to attract them.\"</p> <p>Danny Sexton, chairman of the Osceola County Republican party, admits that he has a daunting task ahead of him when it comes to engaging Hispanic voters. \"If you're going to win an election in this state, especially from Osceola County south, you've got to figure out how you're gonna appeal to Hispanic voters and independents because Republicans are not going to win if they don't,\" he said.</p> <p>As chairman of the county's Republican party, it's obvious who Sexton is pulling for. But he has his eyes on a longer-term prize.</p> <p>\"I want people in the state party when this election cycle is over to be able to look at Osceola County and say: 'They got it right, they figured out a way to reach out to an incredibly diverse population, a changing population. A population that 10 years ago looked entirely different than it does today and that we figured out how to appeal to people's best interest.'\"</p> <h2>Pueblo factbox</h2> <p>(All demographic data comes from the 2010 US census.

  "<p>Senior Republican figures attempted to downplay the role of money in the presidential race Sunday, as Barack Obama embarked on a new push for funds having <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/06/barack-obama-181m-fundraising\">already announced a record monthly haul</a>.</p> <p>Speaking on CNN's State of the Union, Republican national committee chairman Reince Priebus prompted speculation that Democrats were opening up a war-chest gap as the election heads into its final month.</p> <p>A day after Obama announced a $181m total for September donations \u2013 the highest monthly total posted by either candidate to date \u2013 Priebus admitted that he was unsure that Republican candidate Mitt Romney would be able to match what he described as as an \"impressive number\".</p> <p>\"We all understand that this race isn't going to come down to money,\" he added, while suggesting that the Republicans still had \"all the money we need to be competitive\".</p> <p>Obama's announcement, made via a tweet Saturday, that supporters had helped amass the largest one-month fundraising total for his re-election campaign has taken the wind out of the Republican sails following what was widely seen as a win for Romney in the first presidential debate on Wednesday night.</p> <p>That victory appears to have been short-lived. A little more than 24 hours after the inaugural head-to-head, new job figures came out that gave cheer to Obama's re-election efforts.</p> <p>Friday's monthly unemployment data revealed that the US had added 114,000 new jobs in September, in line with expectation.</p> <p>But a dramatic upwards revision of the previous month's data, from 96,000 to 142,000 new jobs, saw the headline unemployment rate fall to 7.8%, from 8.1% \u2013 the first dip below 8% since Obama took office in January 2009.</p> <p>It enabled the president to shrug off the disappointment of a lacklustre debate performance.</p> <p>The job figures were \"a reminder that this country has come too far to turn back now\", he told supporters while on the stump in Virginia.</p> <p>Romney countered that \"by any rational measure, it is crystal clear we are in the middle of a jobs crisis\".</p> <p>But the news is likely to eat into any debate bump the Republican candidate may have been expecting.</p> <p>As it is, polls suggest that a strong performance during the head-to-head exchange on Wednesday \u2013 broadcast to an estimated audience of 67 million viewers \u2013 has not done enough to tip the balance in Romney's favour.</p> <p>An Ipsos/Reuters snapshot of voter intention released Saturday evening found that Obama maintained an advantage, albeit a reduced one.</p> <p>The survey, conducted after the debate was aired, put the Democrat ahead by two points, with a 47% to 45% lead over Romney.</p> <p>It is down from the six point margin he had held in some polls prior to Wednesday. But it nonetheless indicates that the Republican challenger still has some way to go in convincing swing voters.</p> <p>Ipsos pollster Julia Clark said: \"We haven't seen additional gains from Romney. This suggests to me that this is more of a bounce than a permanent shift.\"</p> <p>The task of turning around the polls could be made harder for the Republican challenger if his campaign finances for September show a shortfall in donations when compared to the White House incumbent.</p> <p>Figures from the Federal Election Commission revealed that in August, Obama pulled ahead in terms of monthly donations, with $114m compared to $111m for Romney.</p> <p>Meanwhile, greater spending earlier in the race has depleted the Republican candidate's war chest, undermining claims that he had a cash advantage over his rival.</p> <p>Priebus, on CNN's State of the Union, said the impressive fundraising figures of Obama were \"no surprise\", adding: \"I've been saying that President Obama is going to raise a billion dollars for a year and a half\".</p> <p>But behind the scenes, Romney backers may be getting jittery over the greater spend potential of the Obama camp. The additional cash is likely to pay dividends when it comes to attack ads being played in key battleground states.</p> <p>In a bid to lock in the cash advantage, Obama embarked on a two-day fundraising push in California on Sunday.</p> <p>Star-studded bashes are planned in Los Angeles and San Francisco in an effort to milk the lucrative Hollywood and tech industries, thought to bend towards the Democrats.</p> <p>\"There is exactly one month left to go until election day,\" Obama campaign manager Jim Messina said in an email pitch ahead of the visit.</p> <p>\"The stakes are too high for us to take our foot off the gas now,\" he added.</p>",
  "<p>For the past decade, Maricopa County sheriff Joe Arpaio has embodied Arizona's high-profile crackdown on undocumented immigrants and, some would say, on Latinos in general. The man who calls himself \"America's toughest sheriff\" has raided communities around and in the state capital, Phoenix, delicately dubbing the operations \"crime-suppression sweeps\".</p> <p>Before abruptly halting them at the end of 2011, Arpaio carried out 20 sweeps, arresting 1,500 people.</p> <p>One of the smallest communities Arpaio raided, and the county's poorest, fought back the hardest, helping to ignite a backlash against anti-immigrant policies that is changing the face of Arizona politics. Guadalupe, a one-square-mile community of 5,500 perched on the edge of southeast Phoenix and 61% Hispanic, was the first to stand up to the sheriff.</p> <p>As the 2012 presidential election looms, Guadalupe's counter-punch to Arpaio shows just how explosive the power of the Latino community might be throughout the state, particularly in energizing the youth. Just how much this will matter in November remains to be seen, but one thing is for sure: the political momentum has radically shifted, and the Latino electorate can feel the wind on its backs.</p> <p>Battered by Arpaio's sweeps and the nation's harshest series of anti-immigrant legislation for most of the last decade, the state's Hispanic community is now an angry and energized demographic that is mobilizing and fighting back.</p> <p>In the last four years, Hispanics have elected a growing number of candidates to the Phoenix city council and state legislature. Last November, they recalled the roaring lion of the state's anti-immigrant image, former state senator Russell Pearce. It was a humiliating fall for the leader of the Republicans in the Arizona senate who was the architect behind the nationally polarizing \"papers please\" law SB1070, and a key supporter of a ballot initiative passed in 2004 that demanded proof of citizenship for public services. Arpaio, too, faces a civil lawsuit in the Arizona courts for alleged racial profiling though a second legal challenge by the US justice department <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/31/joe-arpaio-investigation-_n_1848384.html \">was recently dropped</a>.</p> <p>On the night of one of his raids in 2008, mayor Rebecca Jimenez met Arpaio face-to-face, surrounded by 250 angry community members as his deputies flooded her town. She handed him a statement from the town's council, telling him not to come back.</p> <p>\"He erupted.0Hhe was so mad that spit flew on my face,\" Jimenez said. \"He told me: 'You don't want us back?' And I said: 'No, we don't want you back.' He said: 'Too bad, I'm coming back tomorrow.' But he didn't.\"</p> <p>Guadalupe tried to sever its policing contract with Arpaio but failed.<br>Nevertheless, Arpaio attempted to pull out his deputies, leaving Guadalupe defenseless. In the proceeding year, the town filed a federal lawsuit against the sheriff for canceling services over being criticized. It became an embarrassing battle for him that played out in the media.</p> <p>Although Guadalupe is small, it illustrates in concentrated form the potential clout of Hispanic politics when the community is mobilised. Few think Latinos will tip this November's vote in Obama's favor in Arizona, but the Hispanic population is certain to climb its from current 30%. Hispanic youth, who make up 43% of all K-12 students in the state, will come of voting age, and some political observers predict that the effects of SB1070, which was recently upheld in part by the US supreme court, will serve to further accelerate Latino political engagement.</p> <p>\"Within 10 to 15 years, we could be a state like New Mexico, or more likely, California,\" said Arizona State University political science professor Rodolfo Espino, referring to two states with Hispanic populations of 46% and 38% respectively. California is a Democratic fortress, while New Mexico has been decided by a few thousand votes either way in two out of the past three presidential elections. </p> <p>Arizona Hispanics are expected to represent at least 12% of the electorate or more in the upcoming election. In 2010, Hispanics represented a record 18% of the electorate, according to Antonio Gonzalez of the William C Velasquez Institute.</p> <p>\"Sometimes you have to get kicked in the shins really hard so you feel the pain,\" said the Democratic congressman for Tucson Raul Grijalva, who called for a boycott of his own state when SB1070 passed.</p> <h2>'The train's already left the station'</h2> <p>Andrew Sanchez was elected to Guadalupe's town council at the age of just 29 in the aftermath of Arpaio's sweep on the town. He remembers at least 50 deputies, some on bikes, others on horses or in helicopters, and the bomb squad.</p> <p>\"When you see a public official at the level of sheriff lying about a small town that he thought had no push and no influence and he could just bash us, and beat us, it hurt,\" said Sanchez. He takes offence to the sheriff's assumption that many residents of Guadalupe were in the country illegally.</p> <p>Guadalupe is largely comprised of members of the Yaqui Indian tribe, who, at the turn of the 20th century, fled across the border after a failed uprising just before the Mexican revolution. Today, the town known for its Lent and Easter ceremonies remains beset by alcoholism, domestic violence and all the trappings of \"historical trauma\", said Yaqui cultural sensitivity specialist Rafael Armenta. Per capita income is just over $11,000, <a href=\"http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0104652.html\">one-third of the statewide average.</a> </p> <p>It is the Hispanic youth, like Sanchez, who are spearheading the new political push. The demographics are irreversible, Grijalva said. \"You can put impediments in front of it, you can make it difficult, but the train's already left the station.\"</p> <p>Young Dreamers \u2013 undocumented Latino students who could become permanent residents if the Dream Act ever passed \u2013 meet late one recent night in Phoenix, crafting strategy on how to get-out-the-vote to their communities.</p> <p>Daniel Rodriguez, one such Dreamer, had his educational hopes derailed after Proposition 300 passed in 2006. The measure forced him, and all other undocumented students, to pay out-of-state college tuition, which was three times as much, and he lost financial aid.</p> <p>\"What people did inadvertently in taking away our education was really release the energy that immigrant youth have,\" Rodriguez said.</p> <p>The group he helped co-found years ago, the Arizona Dream Act Coalition, is raising money to send him back to law school.</p> <p>The youth first saw the extent of their power in 2008, when a grassroots door-to-door campaign tripled the Hispanic voter turnout in a southwest Phoenix city council district and produced an upset win for Michael Nowakowski. His campaign manager, Ruben Gallego, was elected to the state legislature two years later aged 28.</p> <p>Three years later, another Nowakowski disciple, Daniel Valenzuela made national headlines when his young volunteers, \"Team Awesome,\" knocked on 72,000 doors to get him on the Phoenix city council. Most recently, Hispanic voters scored their biggest victory yet with the recall of Pearce, the first-ever Arizona legislator removed. It was spearheaded by Citizens For A Better Arizona, an activist group led by Randy Parraz.</p> <p>\"Brother and sisters,\" Parraz yelled during a mid-June meeting that packed a local sanctuary, \"this is happening under our watch! Some of you go back a generation, and have fought these fights, but these fights are not over!\"</p> <p>As the political terrain shifts, one recent poll put Obama only three points behind Romney in Arizona. A late-June poll from Rasmussen by contrast had Romney comfortably ahead by 54 to 41. Romney has yet to open up a field office in Arizona, and party leaders insist the state is not in play.</p> <p>As for Guadalupe, it must wait to see if the upcoming election ends Arpaio's reign. \"Regardless, the culture has been set,\" Sanchez said.</p> <p>A couple of months ago, he began sitting in on police training sessions at Maricopa County sheriff's office. \"I'm probably the last person you'd expect to see in that class,\" Sanchez said.</p> <p>He takes his 19-year-old nephew to the police academy classes there. He says he thinks the young man will \"be a great community leader some day\".</p> <p>\"We need to take notes and understand this department. That's the best way to help our people,\" Sanchez says.</p> <h2>Pueblo factbox</h2> <p>(All demographic data comes from the 2010 US census.

O'Reilly said he thought too much money was given to \"slackers\" who \"mooch\" off the government through welfare and other subsidies, though he supports social security. Stewart took issue with O'Reilly's determinations of what things are acceptable to be subsidised by the government.</p> <p>\"Why is it if you take advantage of a tax break as a corporation you're a smart businessman, but if you take advantage of a tax break as a person you're a moocher?\" Stewart said.</p> <p>In their discussion about the Middle East, the pair addressed the US embassy attacks, which became muddled when Stewart asked about the deadly consulate attack in Libya and O'Reilly responded by talking about the Egyptian embassy. O'Reilly then addressed the Benghazi attack and said he believed Obama had portrayed a weak image in foreign policy.</p> <p>\"You tell them: 'you attack our embassy one more time we're cutting off all our aid and pulling everyone outta there,\" O'Reilly said. This comment earned loud applause from the audience, proving a sizable contingent of O'Reilly supporters were in attendance.</p> <p>One of the few moments of agreement came when Stewart said the US was only as strong as its weakest members. O'Reilly declared himself offended by that statement but rounded his dissenting statements out with a joke and said: \"We are only as a good as CNN?\" Stewart laughed in agreement.</p> <p>O'Reilly and Stewart traded their podiums for upholstered white chairs in the lightning round of the debate and answered preselected questions submitted online and from the audience. Topics included the New York soda ban, the \"war on Christmas\" and the electoral college.</p> <p>Their responses were both serious and silly; when asked what American they would select for president O'Reilly chose Clint Eastwood. His response prompted Stewart to get out of his seat and talk to his now empty chair as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTucyyBRMHY\" title=\"\">Eastwood did to 'Invisible Obama' at the Republican National Convention in August</a>.</p> <p>For the penultimate question of the debate, Hill asked what the most valuable thing they each received from hearing the other person's point of view. Stewart said: \"I have learned that bullshit mountain is tall, bullshit mountain is wide, and it's deep.\"</p> <p>O'Reilly said: \"That I know I'm right.\"</p>",

But the large number of undecided voters and strong turnouts at opposition rallies have given late momentum to the challenger, Henrique Capriles, who has a genuine chance of an upset.</p> <p>With Venezuela sitting on the world's largest oil reserves and Ch\u00e1vez a leading figure in the resurgence of the political left in Latin America, the vote will have an impact on the global economy, energy supplies and regional geopolitics.</p> <p>But for most of the country's almost 19m voters, the key concerns are the alarming rise in the murder rate, the redistribution of oil wealth and the personality and health of the man who has led them for the past 13 years.</p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez \u2013 who was due to vote during the morning in the revolutionary stronghold of the 23 de Enero barrio \u2013 has called his challenger a candidate from the extreme right and warned that \"all the country could lose, even the rich\" if there were a change of government.</p> <p>\"The middle classes should vote for Ch\u00e1vez because we are a guarantee of stability, peace, national development\", he said in a recent broadcast. In contrast, Capriles \u2013 who was scheduled to cast his ballot soon after noon in an upmarket neighbourhood of west Caracas \u2013 has tried to present himself as a centrist who can unify the nation. Declaring himself a David facing a Goliath, he has described Ch\u00e1vez as a formidable contender and promised to continue his poverty relief programs.</p> <p>Poll predictions have ranged from a 25-point landslide for Ch\u00e1vez to a six-point win for Capriles. With the president debilitated by an almost year-long battle with cancer, the recent momentum appears to have been with the opposition. It will not be clear until late on Sunday whether it has done enough to close the ground on one of the most charismatic and controversial campaigners in Latin American history.</p> <p>Both camps predict victory but have said they will accept the results, whatever the outcome. However, analysts fear a narrow win for either side could spark accusations of fraud and street violence. This has put the voting system under intense scrutiny, but it appears robust. External observers and domestic analysts have lauded the procedure as one of the most sophisticated systems in the world.</p> <p>Voters first register themselves by inputting their name, national identity number and thumbprint into a console. They then cast an electronic vote for their preferred party candidate on a touchscreen. Their vote enters the central counting system and is also printed so that they can confirm that it has been recorded properly before putting this hard copy in a ballot box \u2013 more than half the contents of which will later be cross-checked with the electronic data to ensure the system has not been hacked.</p> <p>Voters must then sign a form to confirm they have cast a vote. Before they leave, the little finger on their left hand is marked with indelible purple ink so they cannot return to vote a second time.</p> <p>\"This system is 100% fraud proof and has been recognised as such by outside political institutions,\" said Luis Guillermo Piedra, of the National Electoral Council.</p> <p>Former US president Jimmy Carter has described the system as superior to that of the US. His Carter Centre, based in Atlanta, Georgia, has noted that many Venezuelans are concerned that a new electronic voting system might enable authorities to tell how they voted, exposing them to retaliation if they vote against Ch\u00e1vez. \"This concern has no basis, however,\" the centre said. \"The software of the voting machines guarantees the secrecy of the vote.\"</p> <p>There is less certainty about what happens outside the voting booths. The opposition have lodged 110 complaints about alleged abuses of election laws by the Ch\u00e1vez campaign, mostly relating to his domination of airtime on public broadcasting channels and use of funds, staff and other resources from state-owned enterprises. They also fear that armed militias may put pressure on voters before they go to the polls, though there have been no reports of this to date.</p>"
