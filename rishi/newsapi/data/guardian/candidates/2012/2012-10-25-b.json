  "<p>The Republican Senate candidate Richard Mourdock said on Thursday that he had gained voters as a result of his claim that pregnancies from rape are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/24/richard-mourdock-rape-comments-criticism\">\"something that God intended to happen\"</a>.</p> <p>The GOP candidate from Indiana was criticised by Republicans and Democrats after he made the comments during a debate on Tuesday. Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate, has become embroiled in the row after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/24/richard-mourdock-rape-remarks-romney?intcmp=239\">refusing to withdraw his support for Mourdock</a>. President Obama said Mourdock's remarks were \"demeaning to women\".</p> <p>But Mourdock said on Thursday that his popularity had been unaffected by the fallout. Asked about voters who might not vote for him because of the remarks, Mourdock said: \"I haven't heard of those voters,\" <a href=\"http://www.indystar.com/article/20121025/NEWS0502/121025027?gcheck=1&amp;nclick_check=1\">the Indianapolis Star reported</a>.</p> <p>When Mourdock was given an example of one voter who had, in fact, stopped supporting him, he said: \"I assured all women that the issue of rape is a serious issue. It is not one that my God condones. If anyone thinks that I would condone that, that's a ludicrous point of view.\"</p> <p>Asked if his campaign had gained votes after the abortion comment, the Star said Mourdock replied: \"I know we did.\"</p> <p>Mourdock's assertion may come as surprise within his own party. The Senate candidate was the subject of headlines for the second day in a row on Thursday, with criticism coming from prominent Republicans as well as the president.</p> <p>Haley Barbour, the Republican former governor of Mississippi, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505263_162-57539932/haley-barbour-mourdocks-rape-remark-kinda-crazy/\">told CBS's This Morning</a> that Mourdock's remarks were \"kinda crazy\" and said he did not support Mourdock's statements on rape.</p> <p>\"I don't agree with what he said. I thought that what he said was kinda crazy,\" Barbour said. The former governor tried to play down the impact on the presidential race, saying that outside Mourdock's state people are \"not talking about what someone who's secretary of state in Indiana said\".</p> <p>Even if Mourdock's comments \u2013 the latest in a series of missteps by Republicans over issues of rape and abortion \u2013 do not adversely affect his campaign, his notoriety could have an impact on Romney's popularity among women, which polls show has improved over the last month.</p> <p>The latest AP/GfK poll found that Romney has eroded Obama's substantial lead among women \u2013 an issue which has been seen as key to deciding the election. The poll showed Romney dead even with Obama on 47%, having been 16 points behind the president with women voters just a month before.</p> <p>The poll was largely conducted before Mourdock made his remarks, however, and Romney's reluctance to withdraw support from the Indianan is unlikely to be popular. In a debate on Tuesday, Mourdock said he was opposed to abortion even when a woman had been raped, saying \"even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen\".</p> <p>In a press conference on Wednesday, Mourdock said he stood by his comments, apologising only for people misinterpreting them.</p> <p>Obama sought to draw attention to the comments on Wednesday, saying the statement was \"demeaning to women\". Asked about Mourdock's comment on The Tonight Show, Obama told host Jay Leno: \"Rape is rape. It is a crime.\"</p> <p>The president continued the theme on Thursday, telling a crowd of supporters in Florida: \"I don't think politicians in Washington, most of whom are male, should be making healthcare decisions for women.\"</p> <p>Romney refused to answer questions from reporters about Mourdock on Thursday, the Associated Press reported. His campaign spokeswoman, Andrea Saul, said that Romney \"disagrees with Richard Mourdock, and Mr Mourdock's comments do not reflect Governor Romney's views\". However, she added: \"We disagree on the policy regarding exceptions for rape and incest but still support him.\"</p> <p>There was some good news for Mourdock, however, as John McCain, who beat Romney to the Republican nomination for president in 2008, said he still supported Mourdock. McCain had appeared to waver when interviewed by CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday. Asked if he still supported Mourdock, McCain said \"it depends on what he does\".</p> <p>\"If he apologises, says he misspoke and he was wrong, and he asks the people to forgive him then obviously I'd be the first [to forgive Mourdock],\" he said.</p> <p>On Thursday a spokesman for McCain issued a statement saying the 2008 presidential candidate hoped Mourdock would be elected to the Senate.</p> <p>\"Senator McCain was traveling yesterday in Florida and did not have an opportunity to see Mr Mourdock's full press conference before he taped his CNN interview,\" the statement said. \"Senator McCain is glad that Mr Mourdock apologised to the people of Indiana and clarified his previous statement.\"</p> <p>Mourdock has also been backed by the national Republican senatorial committee, although the New Hampshire senator Kelly Ayotte dropped plans to campaign with Mourdock, a spokesman saying she disagreed with his comments.</p> <p>Mourdock is not the first Republican to find himself in hot water over beliefs related to abortion. In August, Todd Akin, a Republican Senate nominee from Missouri, said that pregnancy as a result of \"legitimate rape\" is rare as \"the female body has ways to try and shut that whole thing down\".</p> <p>Just last week, Republican congressman Joe Walsh of Illinois told reporters \"you can't find one instance\" where it had been necessary to perform an abortion due to the risk to the mother's life, due to medical advances. Medical experts note that there are some cases where the only option in the case of complications sustained during pregnancy is to abort the foetus.</p>",
  "<p>Appearing on behalf of a business partner in an acrimonious divorce case, Governor Mitt Romney testified that a key asset in the case was overpriced at the time, despite a huge spike in the stock less than two years later.</p> <p>Romney testified that the valuation of Staples stock at $2.90 a share in September 1987 seemed \"higher than what we thought was appropriate\". In April 1989 the stock sold for $19 a share in an initial public offering. </p> <p>\"We were obviously proved wrong ultimately, but the price we thought was high at that stage given the company's performance,\" <a href=\"http://tmz.vo.llnwd.net/o28/newsdesk/tmz_documents/1025_romney_2.pdf\">Romney testified</a>. </p> <p>Romney's testimony came during an appeal by Maureen Sullivan Stemberg of her divorce settlement with ex-husband Tom Stemberg, co-founder of Staples, the office supplies company. Sullivan Stemberg <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/yourlife/relationships/articles/2005/11/13/ladies_man/?page=full\">was granted</a> 500,000 shares of stock in the settlement, which she then sold in parts.</p> <p>Romney's testimony came to light as a result of a request by the Boston Globe. The women's rights lawyer Gloria Allred assented to the request on behalf of Sullivan Stemberg. A lawyer for Tom Stemberg agreed to release the testimony if the Globe would give up its parallel request to lift a gag order on Sullivan Stemberg. The Globe agreed, prompting Allred to accuse the newspaper of a \"double-cross\".</p> <p>Sullivan Stemberg has been trying to air her side of the divorce for years, and is the subject of a film documentary produced by a Los Angeles-based company, David Corn reported yesterday <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/10/allred-maureen-sullivan-stemberg-romney-divorce\">in Mother Jones</a>. The divorce has been described as extremely contentious.</p> <p>Sullivan Stemberg is a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kyleraccio/statuses/260956955487645696\">commenter</a> on the Huffington Post, where she has attacked Romney and praised President Obama.<br> It is unclear how much Sullivan Stemberg sold her Staples shares for. That number of shares would have been worth nearly $10m in the <a href=\"http://investor.staples.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=96244&amp;p=irol-faqhttp://\">27 April 1989 IPO</a>. Today Staples has a $7.76bn market capitalization. </p> <p>In her appeal, Sullivan Stemberg argued that her ex-husband's fortune had actually been much larger than it appeared to be during the divorce case, and that she had been short-changed in the settlement. Romney, who testified in 1991, said in effect that the settlement squared with his best judgment of Staples' value at the time. </p> <p>Sullivan Stemberg fought the settlement for a decade before ultimately losing in 1994, when a <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/cmdsxes\">judge ruled it</a> \"fair and reasonable\". </p> <p>Bain Capital invested in Staples in multiple rounds, designated by letters. In round A Bain bought shares for $.80, and in round B for $2.10, Romney testified. In round C, with shares at $2.90, Bain left some Staples stock on the table, he said. \"My personal assessment and that of my partners was that the risk that we would not achieve the plan was high enough that we should not subscribe to our full amount,\" Romney testified. </p> <p>Bain did buy some round C shares, Romney said. \"Although we did not invest as much as we could have invested, we invested to show the other investors we were inviting in at that time that we backed the company and continued to,\" he testified.</p> <p>Staples was already one of the largest investments of the nascent Bain Capital at the time of the stock offer.</p> <p>A lawyer for Romney, Robert Jones, attended the hearings this week in Norfolk Probate and Family Court in Canton, Massachusetts. He did not seek to block the release of Romney's testimony. </p> <p>\"These tabloid charges being shopped by Gloria Allred, one of President Obama's most prominent supporters, are absolutely false,\" Jones <a href=\"http://thepage.time.com/2012/10/24/always-at-the-end/\">told Time</a> in a statement. \"Every time a court has reviewed the allegations of her client over the last 24 years, they have been rejected. There is no new information here.\"</p> <p>Bain Capital, which Romney co-founded in 1984, <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/politics/2008/specials/romney/articles\">put $850,000</a> in Staples in 1986, and eventually grew that stake to $2.5m. It was one of Bain's first and best investments, reportedly netting $13m. Stemberg was a year ahead of Romney in Harvard University's MBA program. In August, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgmR0sbNRMAhttp://\">Stemberg spoke</a> at the Republican National Convention about how Romney \"helped make [Staples] come alive\". </p> <p>\"The truth is, Mitt was not a typical investor,\" Stemberg said. \"He was a true partner.\"</p>",
  "<p>Sitting on a bench on the pretty main street of Concord, New Hampshire's tiny capital city, Gerry Taylor does not have time for either President Barack Obama or Republican challenger Mitt Romney.</p> <p>\"I am seriously thinking of not voting. I am not convinced by either of them. I will wait until the last morning to decide what differences lie between the two of them,\" Taylor said as he waited for a local garage to fix his car.</p> <p>Such sentiments are not uncommon in this small New England state, which is famed for the prickly independence of its electorate. Taylor, a teacher in his early 60s, is a registered independent, which actually puts him in the majority in New Hampshire as they outnumber both Republicans and Democrats on the voting rolls.</p> <p>Traditionally New Hampshire is an afterthought in the general election. Its primary contest \u2013 zealously guarded as the \"first in the nation\" \u2013 ensures a massive importance in selecting a party's presidential candidate but its small size sees it wilt in status before bigger prizes like Florida and Ohio when it comes to the main event. </p> <p>But in a tight contest, where every vote counts, even New Hampshire's four electoral college votes could prove crucial. Just try telling Al Gore that the \"granite state\" is not important. If Gore had won New Hampshire in 2000 \u2013 rather than losing it by a few thousand votes \u2013 then Florida would have been irrelevant and the entire George W Bush presidency would never have happened.</p> <p>Some also believe New Hampshire is a bellwether state this year. A delicate balance of Democrats and Republicans, offset by huge amount of voters in the vital centre, could make it a weather vane for the rest of the nation. </p> <p>\"Whoever wins New Hampshire is probably going to win the other battlegrounds as well,\" said Professor Andrew Smith, a political scientist at the University of New Hampshire. Yet, perhaps typically, New Hampshire is hard to pin down in 2012. From being a Republican mainstay, the state has been shifting more Democratic in recent years, mostly driven by inward migration of wealthy professionals from elsewhere in New England. But this year the state is on a knife-edge. </p> <p>Polling shows a tight race though Obama usually has a slight lead. That means New Hampshire is still up for grabs for Romney, even as other swing states, like Ohio, have strengthened for the president. Romney does have advantages here. His period as governor of neighbouring Massachusetts means he is a familiar face. He won the state's primary earlier this year and he has a home in the well-to-do lakeside community of Wolfesboro. </p> <p>Vociferous support does exist. Concord banker Cindy Motta can barely contain herself. \"I like everything about him. I have read his books. I am hoping to go to his victory party,\" Motta explained.</p> <p>But it was perhaps notable that Motta's praise for Romney came only after a long screed against Obama. \"I am disgusted with Obama,\" she said. That indicates the Republican party in New Hampshire \u2013 as elsewhere \u2013 remains somewhat tepid about its nominee, especially after a gaffe-prone campaign. </p> <p>Just take Gretchen Fowler, a 56-year-old registered Republican who works for an insurer in the college town of Keene. She is voting for Obama. \"Mitt Romney just does not do it for me. He seems like he has made a lot of misstatements. He speaks before he thinks,\" she said.</p> <p>Among independents and even some Democrats it is possible to find hints of what might have been had the Republican party settled on a different candidate. Sitting on his motorbike in the small town of Henniker, Tom Fenner, 60, said he was a registered independent put off by Romney's wooing of the Republican right. </p> <p>\"I could vote for the guy if he had not favoured the party's right wing. He's a centrist and a moderate at heart, but now he is beholden to some very conservative people,\" Fenner said. Even Democrat Jeff Hubbard \u2013 who works at a bank in Concord \u2013 said his vote had been up for grabs. \"I am typically open to change. I have voted both ways before. But I am sticking with Obama now,\" he said. Indeed the extremely conservative field that fought for the nomination appears to have put off New Hampshire's centre-ground. \"Those people were clowns,\" said Fenner.</p> <p>There is another factor that hampers Romney's challenge in New Hampshire: the state's relatively healthy economy. Even during the depths of the Great Recession, the jobless rate in New Hampshire did not touch 8%. Now it is a mere 5.4%. </p> <p>\"That is what has been maintaining Obama. Romney's message is 'jobs, jobs, jobs' but that is not going to ring here,\" said Neil Levesque, executive director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at St Anselm College. That has also made many in the state sympathetic to Obama's main defence on the economy: that he helped stave off disaster. \"You can't expect everything to be fixed in four years,\" said college worker Beth Grey in Henniker.</p> <p>Yet New Hampshire remains hard to pin down. Some experts, such as Smith, believe the importance of independent voters has been over-valued. They are, he insists, actually fairly loyal to the same party identities found everywhere else. \"They are sheep in wolves' clothing. They are fairly typical,\" he said. Others, such as Levesque believe they still make New Hampshire unique. </p> <p>\"They will go with the candidate not the ideology,\" he said. Many independents actually express a desire for a strong third party option. \"That would force us to deal some of our issues and not be so partisan,\" said George Roy, a Keene IT worker. About the only thing that nearly everyone agrees on \u2013 from political scientists to voters in the street \u2013 is that the state is tight and will likely remain so. </p> <p>\"The race here will tighten even more as we get nearer to the election. I think it will get to one or two points,\" said Smith.</p> <p>Perhaps it is just that New Hampshire voters like getting the extended attention. Back in Concord, Taylor admits that he has lived in the state for 18 years, after moving from Bloomington, Indiana. In his former home there was rarely the sort of political attention that is lavished on New Hampshire on a regular four yearly basis. </p> <p>\"In Indiana you would never see anyone when they were running for office,\" he said. \"But here you step into any cafe and you see a presidential candidate pretending to be a common person.\"</p>",
  "<p>Campaign strategists in the vital battleground of Ohio are pioneering a radical new approach to the ground war in the final days of the presidential election, delivering targeted messaging to different parts of the state in an attempt drive up voter turnout on 6 November.</p> <p>Both Barack Obama's re-election operation, Obama For America, and Mitt Romney's campaign are using micro-targeting techniques, backed by traditional TV and radio advertising, to hone messages to the specific political concerns of different corners of the state. The heavily vaunted \"battle for Ohio\" is not a single battle at all \u2013 in fact it is several distinct political conflicts being waged simultaneously in a bid for the state's rich crop of 18 electoral votes out of the 270 needed to win.</p> <p>The strategic shift in focus down to the level of regions, counties or in some cases even neighbourhoods is revolutionising the final stages of the race, with both parties vying aggressively for votes right across the state. The localised model of campaigning being developed in Ohio this year is likely to become the template of future US presidential elections as the technology takes hold.</p> <p>As Chris Redfern, who chairs the Ohio Democratic party, puts it: \"Four years from now it will be even more targeted as the technology improves and advances are made in how we collect information.\"</p> <p>As recently as the 2004 presidential election, Ohio was divided for campaigning purposes in half \u2013 the Democratic stronghold in the industrialised north, and the more rural and staunchly Republican south.</p> <p>But the advent of targeted messaging has heralded a sea-change in the way the campaigns are being run. In the final two weeks of the presidential contest, Obama will be campaigning as fiercely among the traditionally conservative Appalachian communities in the south-east of Ohio as he is in solidly blue Cleveland.</p> <p>\"In the old days \u2013 eight years ago \u2013 we'd focus on driving up votes in the north of Ohio, then hope we'd outnumbered the conservative turnout in the south-west,\" Redfern said. \"This year we're competing in all Ohio's 88 counties, and we are confident we will find some success in all 88 counties.\"</p> <p>Scott Jennings, Romney campaign director in Ohio, puts the same point another way: \"When our database tells us that there is a household of coal miners in a certain neighbourhood, then volunteers will be calling on them talking about Mitt Romney's plan on energy.\"</p> <p>The impact of this micro-targeting revolution can be clearly seen in four parcels of Ohio, in each of which a distinct political battle is being fought: the west and south-west of Ohio, with its concentration of military bases and suppliers, where the debate revolves around defence cuts; in the north, where it is wall-to-wall auto industry; in the east and south-east, where an argument rages over coal and the future of energy; and in the central zone around the financial and university hub, Columbus, where there is much talk about Wall Street regulation and education.</p> <h2>Defence in the west</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398381649\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/10/25/1351196980689/Barack-Obama-in-Dayton-Oh-006.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama in Dayton, Ohio\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama in Dayton, Ohio. Photograph: Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Dayton area and the west of Ohio is a military powerhouse. It contains the massive Wright-Patterson air force base, which procures all logistics for the US air force as well as developing new systems and technologies.</p> <p>It is not surprising that the military dominates the conversation in this region \u2013 it provides almost 30,000 jobs directly on the base and supports another 35,000 jobs outside, generating almost $5bn a year in business. On the back of those economic imperatives, both presidential campaigns have built their ground operations in the west of Ohio with a firm eye on the military vote.</p> <p>On Obama's side, that was self-evident when he and his running mate Joe Biden came to address a crowd of 10,000 supporters outside Dayton on Tuesday. The president spoke at length about his foreign policy achievements \u2013 pulling out of Iraq, drawing down in Afghanistan and killing Osama bin Laden \u2013 and he promised that if her were re-elected he would \"fight every single day for the men and women who have served our country so bravely\".</p> <p>On Romney's side, the campaign has been putting out TV ads and fliers warning of Obama defence cuts. \"Our message is clear,\" said Jennings, \"we are not going to cut defence as it weakens America and is a real jobs issue in Ohio.\"</p> <p>The two campaigns came to blows recently over the future of the Abrams tank, which is built in a plant in Lima in western Ohio. The Republicans seized on a comment from Biden about the need to reconfigure the military.</p> <p>\"Look, the military says we need a smaller, leaner army. We need more special forces, we don't need more M1 tanks,\" the vice-president said, reflecting the Pentagon's own thinking.</p> <p>The Romney campaign smelled blood, as there are 800 engineering jobs attached to the MI Abrams tank plant. It began running automated phone messages saying that a second-term Obama administration would see the Lima tank plant close with the loss of all those jobs.</p> <h2>Auto industry in the north</h2> <p>The role that Obama played in helping the American auto industry recover after the 2008 crash is his strongest card in Ohio, and he plays it whenever and wherever he's in the state. As Redfern points out, there are auto-related outlets in 82 of Ohio's 88 counties \u2013 providing about one in eight of all jobs in the state.</p> <p>But the car industry is especially concentrated in the north, all along the Lake Erie coastline. It is here that the Obama campaign has been serving a non-stop diet of TV and radio ads, reminding voters that his auto bailout helped save more than 150,000 jobs in Ohio and since June 2009 created an additional 17,000 jobs.</p> <p>That plays well from Toledo in the north-west, home to Chrysler and Jeep, across to Youngstown in the north-east, which produces the new Chevy Cruze. To ram the point home, Obama For America has been <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgiuq2uR6LA\">airing a new TV advert in north Ohio</a> media markets called Made in Ohio. It lingers over the headline of a New York Times article written by Romney headlined: \"Let Detroit Go Bankrupt\".</p> <p>In the final presidential debate on Monday, Romney tried to defend himself against the charge that he would have let the auto industry self-implode by saying he wanted a managed bankruptcy to allow the big car companies to clear their debts and refinance. But he is clearly on the defensive in the densely populated north of the state.</p> <p>The Romney campaign sidesteps the issue of the auto bailout and talks instead about \"manufacturing\" and the trade threat posed by China. \"Manufacturing is crucial to communities like Toledo and Cleveland,\" Jennings said. \"We talk about getting tough on China \u2013 when China cheats that hurts jobs in Cleveland.\"</p> <p>As an indication of the disparity between the two campaigns across the auto belt, Obama For America has 19 field offices in the north-west region around Toledo. Romney by contrast has three.</p> <h2>Coal in the east</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398381650\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/10/25/1351196317684/Ohio-coal-006.jpg\" alt=\"Ohio, coal\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ohio, coal. Photograph: Shannon Stapleton/Reuters</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shannon Stapleton/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the fiercest local battles in this election is being fought in the east and south-east of the state. Yard signs posted on the lawns in front of many houses in the lush Appalachian hills make clear how intense the race is here. \"Stop the war on coal, fire Obama,\" they say.</p> <p>Coal mining is big business in the east of Ohio, with open-top mines, related steel mills and coal-fuelled power plants scattered all over the area. The Romney campaign has been making much of that here, accusing the Obama administration of being hostile towards coal.</p> <p>Paul Ryan and Romney's son Matt were both in coal country this week, holding rallies in which they charged the president with regulating the coal industry to death. The aim is clear: to galvanise the coalmining communities and rural Appalachian folk and cajole them to the polls in an attempt to counter Obama's grip on the auto-industry north.</p> <p>\"We think we have a winning issue here,\" Romney's Ohio director, Scott Jennings, said. \"There are many people in this region who traditionally vote Democrat, but they know Barack Obama has been terrible for them.\"</p> <p>Obama For America is fighting back as best he can. The campaign has been playing clips of Romney standing in front of a coal factory when he was Massachusetts governor and saying: \"That plant kills people\".</p> <p>The Obama campaign has also been emphasising in its media messages in this area that Romney has a Swiss bank account and holdings in the Cayman Islands. \"We calculate that such behaviour doesn't resonate well with the values of the people in this part of the state,\" a senior Obama For America official said.</p> <h2>Education and Wall Street in the centre</h2> <p>Columbus, the state capital, is home to Ohio State University, with about 57,000 students. That's very attractive territory for Obama who in 2008 did well among students.</p> <p>This year, the campaign has been emphasising how the Obama administration has doubled funds for federal Pell Grants to help students pay for college. Latest figures for 2010 show that 363,000 Ohio students benefited from the grants.</p> <p>The Republicans have been focusing more on Columbus's role as the financial capital, highlighting Romney's business career in the hope of impressing this conservative-leaning city.</p> <p>Overall, one of the interesting features of 2012 compared with previous presidential election cycles is how competitive the race is across all these four regions. Unlike in the past, nothing is being left to chance.</p> <p>Dr Melissa Miller, associate professor of political science at Bowling Green State University, said that the battle that is raging across Ohio is partly a reflection of the power of digital micro-targeting that is still in its infancy, and partly the result of such a close race where the harvesting of any additional votes, however few and far between, could prove to be decisive.</p> <p>\"When the race is razor thin as it looks likely to be, then it becomes all about finding your supporters and getting them out to vote,\" Miller said.</p>",
  "<p>If there's one method of communication that the CEOs of American companies have mastered, it's how to send an opinion upon deaf ears, at the time least likely to make a difference. The credibility of corporate leaders is not exactly at an all-time high (just ask Jack Welch).</p> <p>Yet, trying to reverse this curse, 80 of America's most powerful, prestigious corporate chieftains signed their names to a petition on Thursday \u2013 a letter really \u2013 that encourages a perfectly rational response to the coming tax crisis that faces America. </p> <p>That coming crisis is called the \"fiscal cliff\". It will take place in two months. A lot of the talk about it is highly intellectual and mostly impenetrable, but it really will affect the average American taxpayer. </p> <p>Here's what will happen: a number of tax breaks will lapse, and regular people will feel the pinch when tax season comes next year. For instance, the mortgage interest-rate deduction will be over, which will make it more expensive to own a home \u2013 really unfortunate timing, as unemployment remains high, home budgets are under pressure, and housing seems to be on track for a recovery. </p> <p>Then there's the payroll tax cut. If that goes away, payroll taxes will go up, and nearly $125bn in household income in the US will disappear, according to JP Morgan. There are other potential tax breaks that will disappear from lower-income households, like the earned-income tax credit, which allows people with modest incomes to get tax breaks if they have children. </p> <p>Overall, Americans will pay more in taxes than they have in 12 years, and legislators would also be taking away the real power of the tax system: the government's moral incentives to having children, home-ownership, and hiring. </p> <p>So it's clear that most American households will suffer in some respect if Congress fails to stop us from going over this fiscal cliff. American businesses are already suffering, or at least believe they are. The New York Times said its revenues fell largely because advertisers were holding back on budgets for fear that the fiscal cliff would destabilize the economy. We don't even need the fiscal cliff to occur to hurt us \u2013 the fear of the fiscal cliff is enough. </p> <p>But the thoughts of 80 CEOs are not going to assuage those fears, or convince Congress or the candidates that they need to act urgently.</p> <p>That's too bad. The CEOs point out, simply and with no partisan tint, that the tax math we've been hearing on the political stump doesn't exactly make sense in the real world. </p> <p>It's not exactly a shocking suggestion that campaign promises aren't always rooted in reality. But even sensible messages get drowned in the noise of \"October surprises\" and other sensationalist election nonsense. </p> <p>For one thing, the timing of the letter is all wrong. The CEOs would clearly like to influence what happens immediately post-election, when a lame-duck Congress is supposed to use their last few breaths to pass legislation to keep the country from careening off the fiscal cliff. But both President Obama and Governor Romney are cramming for election day. It's probably a good day for each of them now if they can keep their shoelaces tied and read a few policy briefings on Benghazi while hitting five states in 24 hours for campaigning. </p> <p>Paying attention to to-do lists \u2013 even from donation-rich corporate America \u2013 is not likely to hit high on the agenda. </p> <p>\"It's very weird timing,\" says Howard Gleckman of the Tax Policy Center. \"I wasn't quite sure why they put it out now. I can't picture Mitt Romney saying, 'I've been completely wrong about taxes, and we're now going to use tax increases to reduce the deficit!' I don't think that's the outcome.\"</p> <p>Another reason this letter won't change much is that it needs greater numbers for support. </p> <p>\"There are only 80 CEOs who signed it, and there are lot of CEOs missing from that list,\" points out Gleckman. \"There's a long way to go before the public and the business community are convinced.\"</p> <p>Gleckman says what voters and other business leaders need to be convinced of is the same thing that Congress needs to be convinced of: that avoiding the fiscal cliff will involve both raising taxes and cutting government programs. No shortcuts. No fairy tales. </p> <p>Yet another reason this letter is likely to have little impact is that the subject matter is not exactly the kind of thing you can rally voters around. </p> <p>There are few Americans who understand the fiscal cliff and its implications; making sense of tax policy is like falling down the rabbit hole. Even most CEOs don't care, says Gleckman. \"I don't think voters feel despair. I think they've long since tuned these people out. I've even heard this from CEOs: 'Just tell me when this is over. When these guys actually have a plan, call me. I don't want to hear about this anymore.'\" </p> <p>Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist for Janney Montgomery Scott, says the fiscal cliff may be an impending financial crisis, but for now it's a political one. \"It's a game of fiscal chicken, where both parties have their interests about how to support economic growth and control long-term budget deficits, and both have incentives to delay any long-term resolution. There's no incentive for anyone in Congress to act right now. it would be like shooting yourself in foot.\"</p> <p>Congress may not even feel that urgency after the election. The election could change the balance of power between Republicans and Democrats. New legislators will be uncomfortable delving into complicated issues; the old ones may not have a good grip on party loyalties. </p> <p>And that's even if Congress has a plan. It's more likely that, under the pressure of saving the country, they will not have a coherent vision of what to do about some very loaded issues. Many major investors and bankers expect Congress to do what it did before: delay the decision for another few months, or even a year. Then, come tax season in 2014, the average American household may see its taxes rise by $3,500, according to estimates by the Tax Policy Center. </p> <p>LeBas says Congress has to act. \"Economically speaking, the worst possible outcome is another kick the can down the road.\" Unfortunately, that's what many are expecting to happen. </p> <p>There was story in The Onion this week that seemed oddly prescient: \"After Four Debates,\" the headline declared, \"Entire Nation is Undecided.\" One could say the same of Congress \u2013 and average American households will pay the price. Corporate leaders, even in the most sensible of their talk, will have little influence.</p>",
  "<p>Iain Duncan Smith, the welfare secretary, appears to be undertaking a bold demographic experiment to reduce the growth in state spending by limiting the amount of welfare that couples can receive.</p> <p>At present, poor families get child benefit and child tax credits for every child they have. In the future it appears such payments will be restricted to just the first couple of children. Call it the coalition's two-child policy.</p> <p>Duncan Smith, in comments leaked before a speech on Thursday in Cambridge, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9632688/Iain-Duncan-Smith-suggests-two-child-limit-for-benefits.html\" title=\"\">asked</a>: \"Should families expect never-ending amounts of money for every child when working households must make tough choices about what they can afford?\" \u2013 arguing that parts of the benefits system promoted \"destructive\" behaviour.</p> <p>Duncan Smith appears to be conflating the idea of worklessness with payments for children. If that is the case then he will not be saving much money with this measure: just 4% of families on jobseeker's allowance have more than two children. Say each child gets roughly \u00a365 a week \u2013 about \u00a350 from child tax credits and the rest in child benefits \u2013 then the savings are about \u00a3300m a year. In fact they would be much lower, as half the people on jobseeker's allowance get work within six months.</p> <p>Now consider that Duncan Smith is trying to save \u00a310bn a year. To make this magnitude of savings the government would have to look at the 2 million children in the 584,000 working families with more than two children who get child tax credits. These are people who are in low-paid jobs struggling to make ends meet. There are another 880,000 working families with more than two children receiving child benefit, with around 2.9 million children affected.</p> <p>Child tax credits are means-tested but the Children's Society calculates that the saving on them, if they were restricted to taking a maximum of two children into account, would be about \u00a33.5bn a year. Savings on child benefit, if reshaped in a similar way, would yield up to \u00a31bn. This is big money.</p> <p>However, such calculations expose the government to the charge that it is targeting strivers rather than the much-touted slackers of modern-day Britain. As Karen Buck, Labour MP and parliamentary welfare expert, points out: \"Just 1.5% of the benefit population have never worked.\" Targeting such families would yield little cash for the Treasury.</p> <p>Instead the government is using the rhetoric of scroungers to slice benefits from low-paid working families. The result is many more are forced to rely on welfare \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/22/working-people-housing-benefit-report\" title=\"\">just look at predictions that a million earners will be dependent on welfare to keep a roof over their heads by the next election, more than double the number before the recession began</a>.</p> <p>To his credit Duncan Smith has faced down more radical calls to prune welfare. However, he appears to divide people into the lifetime poor and the striving, working classes \u2013 and claims that people's vitality has been sapped by the social programmes meant to save them. Like Mitt Romney's inaccurate description of America's 47% \u2013 an entitlement society dependent upon government \u2013 the welfare secretary's words suggest he too has bought into the idea that the poor are not victims of circumstance but of their own actions.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 26 October 2012 to update figures supplied by the Children's Society for savings that would be made on child tax credits and child benefit if they were restricted to two children. The original figures of \u00a38bn and \u00a35bn respectively were estimates which the Children's Society revised after publication.</p>",
  "<p>An off-hand and off-colour remark by Barack Obama may have signalled a decision by his campaign to go nuclear on Mitt Romney's shifting ideological track record.</p> <p>In an<a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/obama-and-the-road-ahead-the-rolling-stone-interview-20121025\"> interview with Rolling Stone</a>, conducted by celebrated presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, Obama labelled Romney a \"bullshitter\" \u2013 and rather than backing away from the comment, a senior Obama campaign adviser said it raised \"trust\" issues with Romney's candidacy.</p> <p>Brinkley's interview recorded <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-34222_162-57540081/obama-kids-know-other-guy-is-a-bulls-er/\">a conversation between Obama and Eric Bates, the executive editor of Rolling Stone</a>.

They look at the other guy and say, 'Well, that's a bullshitter, I can tell'.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked to explain Obama's remark, spokesman Dan Pfeiffer told reporters that he hadn't seen the article, but went on to say: \"Trust is a very important part of the election. The president is someone who says what he means and does what he says, and Governor Romney's answers in the debates on domestic issues and foreign policy raise real questions about that.\"</p> <p>Pfeiffer warned people not to be \"distracted by the word\" bullshitter but to focus on the issues. </p> <p>Since the debates, Obama has called Romney's shift towards the political centre \"Romnesia\" for overlooking his past positions.</p> <p>In an interview with CBS this morning, Brinkley said the term is a translation of what Obama was already saying on the campaign trail: \"It's another part of Romnesia, I suppose. The working man's Romnesia is BS-er.\"</p> <p>The Romney campaign said Obama's language was a sign of desperation. \"President Obama is rattled and on the defensive.

  "<p>British reluctance to be a conduit for a US military buildup in the Gulf seems to have taken Washington by surprise but it demonstrates the lessons of Iraq are deeply etched in Whitehall. This time the UK is making clear it will not write blank cheques and will take its own decisions on what is legal and what is not.</p> <p>The argument does not reflect a difference of opinion over the utility of going to war as a means of stopping Iran's nuclear programme. US military commanders, like their British counterparts, believe that any such venture is likely to backfire in current circumstances, persuading the Iranian leadership that it has no choice but to make nuclear weapons as fast as possible.</p> <p>Circumstances will change, however. A <a href=\"http://world.time.com/2012/10/23/whether-its-romney-or-obama-u-s-will-consider-direct-talks-with-iran/\" title=\"\">new diplomatic push</a> is planned for after the US elections, offering sanctions relief in return for limits on Iranian uranium enrichment. But if that initiative fails, tensions will rise, and rash moves with unintended consequences will become more of a risk. The military calculus facing the next US president will present itself in ever more shades of grey, as will the legalities.</p> <p>The most immediate unknown is what Israel will do if diplomacy fails. US commanders insist publicly and privately they are in the dark about Binyamin Netanyahu's thinking on a military strike aimed at setting back Iran's progress. The betting in the Pentagon this week is 60-40 against an Israeli attack, but the odds change every day.</p> <p>If Israel strikes and Iran responds with an attack against the US or its Gulf allies, then Washington would undoubtedly retaliate. If the Iranian response is tightly focused on Israel, and roughly proportionate, the American reaction is harder to predict. It depend to some extent on who will be in the Oval Office at the time. And again, the legalities of any action would depend on the details.</p> <p>The Iranians will be making their own calculations, but it is a safe bet the country's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, will not jeopardise the regime's survival. An all-out US assault would do just that, and awareness of that risk underlies everything Tehran does, but as the stakes rise the law of unintended consequences begins to take over.</p> <p>As the sanctions screw tightens on Iran, the regimes or elements within it could miscalculate. Iran is finding it harder and harder to sell its oil and, by some estimates, will run out of storage space for it in January, potentially forcing it to turn off the pumps and thereby degrade its own infrastructure.</p> <p>US military officials speculate that if Tehran, or more specifically the Revolutionary Guards, decide to strike back against a sanctions regime Iran sees as an act of war, they would do so in ways they hope would be unattributable, by secretly mining the shipping lanes or triggering a vast oil spill in the Strait of Hormuz. That would make the Strait impassable to shipping and threaten desalination plants which are essential to life in the Arab Gulf states.</p> <p>Or the Iranian navy could start boarding and inspecting shipping. Each move would invite a counter-move from the US Fifth Fleet, which has been preparing for each contingency, conducting its <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304388004577531331722511516.html\" title=\"\">biggest ever minesweeping exercise</a> in the Gulf last month and beefing up its capacity to handle oil slicks.</p> <p>American and Iranian warships already operate in close proximity in the Gulf, and although the two countries have no diplomatic relations, naval etiquette requires their sailors to talk to each other from bridge to bridge every day. Such polite encounters could easily turn sour and run out of control if tempers heat up.</p> <p>Alternatively, the leadership in Tehran could gamble by raising the level to which it enriches uranium in the hope of forcing western concessions at the negotiating table. Iranian parliamentary officials have suggested the current top level of 20% could be raised to 60%, close to weapons grade. That could cross not just Israeli red lines, but American red lines too.</p> <p>Barack Obama has said he would act to stop Iran building a nuclear weapon, while Mitt Romney said he would prevent Iran's \"nuclear-weapon capability\", leaving his definition vague.</p> <p>As the scenarios proliferate, so do the ramifications in international law, focusing on what constitutes legitimate self-defence. Little wonder the British government is keen to retain its own counsel.</p>",
  "<p>Sudan has complained to the UN security council that Israeli planes bombed a munitions plant in Khartoum, an attack that has been widely interpreted as a warning to Iran over its nuclear programme.</p> <p>Israeli military commentators said that the Yarmouk facility in the Sudanese capital was owned by Iran and had been used to supply weapons to Hamas fighters in the Gaza Strip. The \"impressive\" reach of the secret operation was said to have demonstrated an ability to hit Iran's nuclear facilities \u2014 a similar distance from Israel.</p> <p>As reverberations continued from Tuesday's 1,000-mile attack, Israel would neither confirm nor deny it was involved. Ehud Barak, the defence minister, said : \"There is nothing I can say about this subject.\" But one of his most senior officials praised the country's air force and called Sudan a \"terrorist state\".</p> <p>Sudan's UN ambassador, Daffa-Alla Elhag Ali Osman, called on the security council to condemn the raid as \"a blatant violation of the concept of peace and security\". Iran also denounced Israel, as did Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shia movement with close links to Tehran.</p> <p>Sudan's culture and information minister, Ahmed Bilal Osman, had said earlier that four radar-evading aircraft carried out an attack around midnight on Tuesday. \"We think Israel did the bombing,\" he said. \"We reserve the right to react at a place and time we choose.\"</p> <p>Sudan's state news agency said the planes used \"hi-tech jamming devices\" in the attack and a Sudanese reporter told Israel's Haaretz newspaper that there was a telecommunications blackout for about an hour before the explosions.</p> <p>\"There are two arms factories in this area of the strike: one is the Yarmouk factory, the other is the Sudan Technical Centre,\" a UN source told the Guardian. \"We don't know for certain if they are making weapons or manufacturing ammunition. At the very minimum they are repackaging munitions produced elsewhere. Yarmouk is sponsored by Iran. The Sudan Technical Centre is definitely handling Chinese weapons.\"</p> <p>Israel has long accused Khartoum of serving as a base for Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist movement that controls the Gaza Strip. \"Sudan is a dangerous terrorist state,\" Amos Gilad, an influential former general and senior defence ministry official, told Israel's Army Radio.</p> <p>There was a strong sense that Israel was also sending a blunt message to Iran. Ron Ben-Yishai, a veteran military commentator, wrote in daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth: \"There is no doubt that the explosion in Khartoum will be food for thought not only for the authorities in Sudan but also in Gaza \u2013 and especially in Tehran.\"</p> <p>Ephraim Inbar, a strategic expert, said: \"It is very plausible that Israel was behind the strike. We have operated in that region in response to a variety of intelligence reports in the past. We definitely have the capability [to launch such a strike]. It seems an easy operation, involving four jets. For us it would be a piece of cake.\"</p> <p>The UN source said: \"We know for sure that weapons are flowing from and through Sudan into the Egyptian Sinai, possibly to Gaza. The Egyptians have told us that the arms flowing into Sinai from Sudan are a big security problem. Northern Sinai is full of weapons.</p> <p>\"We have seen in the last few days intense clashes along this northern border, between Israel and Egypt, with armed, radicalised Bedouin groups with a vision of political Islam. There seem to be clear links between this and the strike in Khartoum. In the same days we've seen a dramatic increase in rockets fired into Israel from Gaza. The convergence of these elements points to Israel as the perpetrator.\"</p> <p>In past there have been allegations that Sudan stored chemical weapons for Iraq at the Yarmouk facility. Government officials denied the charge. The attack destroyed part of the compound infrastructure, killed two people and injured another.</p> <p>In April last year, Sudan said it had irrefutable evidence that Israeli attack helicopters had carried out a missile and machine-gun strike on a car south of Port Sudan. That attack mirrored a similar strike by foreign aircraft on a truck convoy reportedly laden with weapons in eastern Sudan in January 2009. That too is widely believed to have been carried out Israel.</p>",
  "<p>Vladimir Putin has accused the western media of hypocrisy in its coverage of Pussy Riot saying the women had crossed a red line. The pro-democracy protesters \"violated the morals of the people\" and after the Stalin-era purge of Orthodox priests it was the Russian state's duty to protect the sanctity of the church, the Russian president added.</p> <p>Three members of the feminist punk band were sentenced to two years in prison in August after performing an anti-Putin song in a Moscow cathedral. One was released this month.</p> <p>Referring to a performance carried out by one of the jailed women before Pussy Riot was formed, the Russian president said: \"Maybe someone likes to have group sex in a museum. It's an insult to women when a pregnant woman has group sex. Does anybody like it?\" Nadezhda Tolokonnikova took part in a group orgy at Moscow's natural history museum to protest the Russian leadership in 2008 as part of a guerrilla art group called Voina.</p> <p>Speaking to the Valdai group of foreign and Russian academics and journalists, Putin said the western media was hypocritical in condemning the imprisonment of the three women, when they were silent about the fact that the man who made \"Innocence of Muslims\", Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, was also in jail.</p> <p>Nakoula is the Egyptian-born US resident thought to be a writer, producer, and promoter that sparked riots and protests erupted in many countries around the world \u2013 and particularly in Islamic countries. He is being held in the United States and faces up to three years in prison for alleged parole violations.</p> <p>Putin also equated the Pussy Riot affair with the work of Russian neo-fascist groups that put posters in supermarkets and malls calling for the expulsion of Jews and foreign workers.</p> <p>\"They too should be convicted of social unrest. Do you really want to support such behaviour? Then why don't you support the man who is in prison and who made that movie?\"</p> <p>He was asked if the years of stability under his regime was in danger of turning into stagnation. In reply Putin listed the achievements of his first two terms of office, saying that average wages were six times greater than when he took over and that national debt was minimal.</p> <p>Commenting on the protests that have shaken Russia since he announced his intention to return to the presidency, Putin said: \"We changed our election system as a result of the protests, introduced direct democratic elections of governors and will so the same with senators in the upper house.\" Critics have said a recent decision to resume gubernatorial elections, a practice abolished by Putin in 2004, is meaningless because of the existence of a so-called presidential \"filter\" for candidates.</p> <p>\"About the opposition, I don't know. I believe the response of those in power should be to involve more and more people,\" Putin said. \"The most important thing is not retaining power but making government more efficient. The work should be united and serious. If we can do that our citizens will appreciate that.\"</p> <p>Commenting on state-run oil major Rosneft's recently announced takeover of Tnk-BP, Putin said he had \"mixed feelings\" about the deal.</p> <p>Rosneft is expected to entirely take over the oil company in the next six months, after buying out BP's 50 per cent share this week and announcing a deal to buy out the remaining 50 per cent held by a consortium of Russian oligarchs.</p> <p>\"The government and I had mixed feelings when this project came up,\" Putin said. \"The fact that a company with state participation was increasing its market share at the expense of its foreign partner was a minus.\"</p> <p>Putin oversaw a vast campaign to re-nationalise some of Russia's main oil and gas assets during his first two terms as president. Rosneft, headed by his close ally Igor Sechin, was a middling oil company until it bought the main assets of Yukos at knockdown prices in a series of bankruptcy auctions held following the arrest of the company's CEO, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, in 2003. Khodorkovsky, who was found guilty of economic crimes and is serving his sentence in a remote northern prison, accused Sechin of orchestrating the campaign against him.</p> <p>The Tnk-BP deal is due to make Rosneft the world's largest listed oil company. Putin said his blessing of the deal was prompted by a desire to dispense of the years-long shareholder conflict inside the company, even though it ran counter to supposed efforts to constrain the state's role in the economy.</p> <p>\"We tried not to get involved but when BP managers came to me and the government and said we want to cooperate with Rosneft we could not say no,\" Putin said. \"We had a difficult choice. In the end we have agreed with the proposal of Rosneft and BP that they will work together.\"</p>",
  "<p>Republican Senate candidate Richard Mourdock remained under pressure on Thursday as oppponents sought to capitalise on the fallout from his claim that pregnancies from rape are \"something that God intended to happen\".</p> <p>Barack Obama criticised the comments as \"demeaning to women\", while even those in his own party distanced themselves. Haley Barbour, the Republican former governor of Mississippi, said Mourdock's remarks were \"kinda crazy\".</p> <p>Mitt Romney has refused to withdraw his support from Mourdock and would not answer reporters' questions about the issue on Thursday.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505263_162-57539932/haley-barbour-mourdocks-rape-remark-kinda-crazy/\">Barbour told CBS This Morning</a> that he did not support Mourdock's comments. </p> <p>\"I don't agree with what he said. I thought that what he said was kinda crazy,\" Barbour said. The former governor tried to play down the impact on the presidential race, saying that outside Mourdock's state people are \"not talking about what someone who's secretary of state in Indiana said\".</p> <p>But Mourdock's comments \u2013 the latest in a series of missteps by Republicans over issues of rape and abortion \u2013 and his refusal to apologise for them, could have an impact on Romney's popularity among women, which polls show has improved over the last month. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://seattletimes.com/html/politics/2019520246_apusappollpresidentialcampaign.html\">latest AP/GfK</a> poll found that Romney has erased Obama's substantial lead among women \u2013 an issue which has been seen as key to deciding the election. The poll showed Romney dead even with Obama, 47-47, despite having been 16 points behind the president with women voters just a month before.</p> <p>The poll was largely conducted before Mourdock made his remarks, however, and Romney's reluctance to withdraw support from the Indianan is unlikely to be popular. During a debate on Tuesday Mourdock said he was opposed to abortion even when a woman has been raped, saying \"even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen\".</p> <p>In a press conference on Wednesday the Senate candidate said he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/24/richard-mourdock-rape-remarks-romney\">stood by his comments</a>, apologising only for people misinterpreting them. </p> <p>Obama sought to draw attention to the comments on Wednesday, saying the statement is \"demeaning to women\". Asked about Mourdock's comment Wednesday on The Tonight Show, Obama told host Jay Leno that \"rape is rape. It is a crime.\"</p> <p>The president continued the theme on Thursday, telling a crowd of supporters in Florida: \"I don't think politicians in Washington, most of whom are male, should be making healthcare decisions for women.\"</p> <p>Romney refused to answer questions from reporters about Mourdock on Thursday, the Associated Press reported. His campaign spokeswoman, Andrea Saul, has said that Romney \"disagrees with Richard Mourdock, and Mr Mourdock's comments do not reflect Governor Romney's views\".</p> <p>However she added: \"We disagree on the policy regarding exceptions for rape and incest but still support him.\"</p> <p>There was some good news for Mourdock, however, as John McCain, who beat Romney to the Republican nomination for president in 2008, said he still supported Mourdock. McCain had appeared to waver <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHrjWUkY2Dc\">when interviewed by CNN's Anderson Cooper</a> on Wednesday. Asked if he still supported Mourdock, McCain said \"it depends on what he does\".</p> <p>\"If he apologises, says he misspoke and he was wrong, and he asks the people to forgive him then obviously I'd be the first [to forgive Mourdock],\" he said.</p> <p>On Thursday a spokesman for McCain issued a statement saying the 2008 presidential candidate hopes Mourdock is elected to the Senate.</p> <p>\"Senator McCain was traveling yesterday in Florida and did not have an opportunity to see Mr Mourdock's full press conference before he taped his CNN interview,\" the statement said.</p> <p>\"Senator McCain is glad that Mr Mourdock apologised to the people of Indiana and clarified his previous statement.\"</p> <p>Mourdock has also been backed by the national Republican senatorial committee, although New Hampshire senator Kelly Ayotte dropped plans to campaign with Mourdock, a spokesman saying she disagreed with his comments.</p> <p>Mourdock is not the first Republican to find himself in hot water over abortion beliefs. In August, Todd Akin, Republican Senate nominee from Missouri, said that pregnancy as a result of \"legitimate rape\" is rare as \"the female body has ways to try and shut that whole thing down\".</p> <p>Just last week Republican congressman Joe Walsh of Illinois told reporters \"you can't find one instance\" where it has been necessary to perform an abortion due to the risk to the mother's life due to medical advances. Medical experts note that there are some cases where the only option in the case of complications sustained during pregnancy is to abort the foetus.</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 Truth be told, Barack Obama has probably already lost the votes of that portion of America scandalised by bad language. For one thing, his autobiography, Dreams From My Father, makes copious use of the word \"motherfucker\" \u2013 while his rival, linguistically speaking, seems to inhabit a 1950s sitcom set among the clean-cut patrons of a milkshake parlour. (As governor of Massachusetts, one former colleague told the New York Times recently, Romney used to tell people to \"go to H-E-double-hockey-sticks\", though he does indulge, the paper conceded, in \"the occasional 'crap'.\")</p> <p>But now the coarseness chasm has widened. As an interview team from Rolling Stone were leaving the Oval Office earlier this month, that magazine reveals, \"executive editor Eric Bates told Obama that he had asked his six-year-old if there was anything she wanted him to say to the president \u2026 She said: 'Tell him: You can do it.'\" Obama replied: \"You know, kids have good instincts. They look at the other guy and say, 'Well, that's a bullshitter, I can tell'.\" \"Bullshitter\" may not be \"motherfucker\" \u2013 but as an insult directed at one presidential candidate by another, it's this campaign's high, or low, point, which makes it, in the immortal words of Joe Biden, \"a big fuckin' deal.\" \"The president is someone who says what he means and does what he<br>says,\" Obama's spokesman Dan Pfeiffer tried to clarify, urging<br>reporters not to get \"distracted by the word\".</p> <p>We can expect Romney's media surrogates, in the coming days, to paint the president as classless and foulmouthed, though Romney himself was apparently simply too gosh-darned shocked by the news to comment, preferring to drown his sorrows, according to unconfirmed reports, in a delicious ice-cream soda. (With Diet Coke.)</p> <p>\u2022 A recurring theme of the campaign has been the vigorous efforts, by some Republican supporters, to find ways to deny the reality of Obama's narrow but steady lead in numerous swing-state polls and electoral college predictions. First came Unskewed Polls, a website that nudged results in Romney's favour by \u2013 and I'm simplifying, but only slightly \u2013 adding a few more points to his totals.</p> <p>Then came the rise of the \"Nate Silver Truthers\", sceptics determined to find bias in the methods of the New York Times's in-house polling geek, whose numbers are crunched almost entirely by (an evidently left-leaning) computer.</p> <p>And now please welcome Townhall.com commentator Matt Towery, who's convinced the polls are biased towards Obama because \u2026 some of them take 20 minutes to answer. \"And what hardworking, productive member of a family, taking care of a business, house or family, has time to spare for such an opus? Likely not the type that fits the profile of a Romney voter.\" Never mind that good models iron out such hypothetical biases by adjusting for polls' past performance in predicting results. This new angle seems unassailable: polling itself is biased towards layabout Democrats! Next month: why \"voting\" isn't really a trustworthy measure of how people vote.</p> <p>\u2022 Where now for multimillionaire self-embarrasser, journalist-manipulator and Scotland-annoyer Donald Trump, after yesterday's heartless announcement that he'd be withholding $5m from deserving charities unless the president did something he'd obviously never do? The New York property news site The Real Deal reports that Trump, who enjoys pretending to \"fire\" people, has been fired in a non-pretend fashion, after the board of one of his flagship buildings, Manhattan's Trump Place, voted to replace the Trump Organisation as the building's manager.</p> <p>Still, he'll always have the gossip columnists and the conservative rabble-rousers, right? Maybe not: the Fox News talking head Michelle Malkin responded to his latest stunt by calling him a \"clown\", which is a bit like being called a \"cantankerous vegetarian indie rock pioneer\" by Morrissey; and now the veteran gossip writer Lloyd Grove has had enough, too. \"At long last, you have made yourself irrelevant,\" he writes, and vows, on behalf of his employer the Daily Beast, no further coverage of Trump's antics for the foreseeable future. \"Or, at the very least, before the November 6 election.\" So a week and a half, then.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hello Brandon. What did you have for breakfast today?</strong></p> <p>I have the same thing every day. I find it comforting. I have a banana, but I can never eat the whole banana.

Our state animal is the bighorn sheep. Our bird is the bluebird.</p> <p><strong>You know your Nevada.</strong></p> <p>I'm proud of it. It's my roots. Sage is our state plant. The bristlecone pine is the state tree.</p> <p><strong> And the Killers have performed the state song ...</strong></p> <p>Yes, Home Means Nevada. I used to sing it in elementary school. It's probably one of my earliest memories of music.</p> <p><strong>Have you ever recorded it?</strong></p> <p>Not really. Harry Reid is the Senate majority leader and he went to the same high school that my parents did, and when he gives speeches in Nevada, he comes out to our recording of Home Means Nevada that we did for him.</p> <p><strong>And he is a Democrat?</strong></p> <p>Democrat Mormon.</p> <p><strong>Whereas Mitt Romney \u2026</strong></p> <p>Republican Mormon.</p> <p><strong>What's the political split between Mormons?</strong></p> <p>We're leaning on the Republican side. (Laughs). Probably, like, 90%.</p> <p><strong>So you had lunch with Romney in Las Vegas?</strong></p> <p>Yeah. It was fine. We went to Caesar's Palace. I think I had a burger.</p> <p><strong>Who picked up the tab?</strong></p> <p>I think Mitt might've got that one.

We also get asked from Obama.

Harry knows my aunt Barbara.</p> <p><strong>It's quite an odd thing to be in a tussle between politicians.</strong></p> <p>But you know, I keep saying it, I feel like a broken record but we're neutral.

You'd come back when you're finished and you would give me your tag and I would give you your bag. And you would tip me.</p> <p><strong>For Brits visiting America, the tipping thing can be very troubling.

Maybe if it was like 1965.</p> <p><strong>You recently had a debate on Swedish TV with prominent atheist Richard Dawkins <a href=\"#4\">(4</a><a name=\"4back\">)</a></strong>.</p> <p>Yeah, let me say this. I gave some decent answers that were edited out. So, the world is against the Christian man.</p> <p><strong>Did you know Dawkins was going on?</strong></p> <p>I found out the day before and I know who he is, and I knew about The God Delusion and all of those things. For him he sees the beauty in science proving something and finding out origins of things. And that's enough for him. Nothing that science will ever find will disprove that God had a hand in it, for me. So it's a useless debate. And nothing that has been found has changed the gospel that I believe in.</p> <p><strong>Did you speak to him on the phone afterwards, as was mooted?</strong></p> <p>No, I would like to. I have issues with him. He generalises things about my church and kind of drags it through the dirt a lot.</p> <p><strong>Are you working on this year's Killers Christmas single yet?</strong></p> <p>Well, let me just go back to it. It's just there's so much to be said by his behaviour and the way that he is in interviews, for the most part. I've seen other interviews with him.</p> <p><strong>Words like \"conman\" and \"fake\" did seem designed to provoke a reaction.</strong></p> <p>Yeah, and this is information that he's getting off the internet! [Laughs] He's this smart guy and getting his information from the wrong places.

  "<p>It's almost exactly a year since Silvio Berlusconi resigned as Italian prime minister, and on Wednesday<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20071081\" title=\"\"> he confirmed that he has no intention of standing for office in 2013</a>. Many in Italy suggested then that the curtain had finally come down on the country's bizarre second republic. It was, they said, the end of an era in which a media mogul could turn elections into a personality cult. Now, the thinking went, we were entering the third republic.</p> <p>The past 12 months seem to have confirmed the theory. Some of the major players and parties from the previous two decades have been obliterated. Berlusconi has, by his standards, kept a low profile and his party, in the regional elections of May 2012, plummeted from 30% to just 14% of the vote. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/05/umberto-bossi-resigns-northern-league\" title=\"\">Umberto Bossi</a> of the Northern League has resigned, caught up in an embezzlement scandal. In those same elections last May, only two of 12 Northern League mayors were returned at the first ballot. Respected leaders on the left, too, are falling like cards: last week <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Veltroni\" title=\"\">Walter Veltroni</a> announced his retreat from frontline politics, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massimo_D%27Alema\" title=\"\">Massimo D'Alema</a> has offered to do likewise.</p> <p>But if certain parties from the second republic seem to have imploded, the nature of the third republic is still extremely elusive. For better or for worse, everyone knew what the first republic was about: from roughly 1948 to 1992, Italy was dominated by loquacious, patrician Christian Democrats. It was crystal-clear what they stood for (Catholicism) and what they opposed (communism), although there were plenty of grey areas when it came to corruption and crime. The second republic, from 1993 to 2011, was dominated by Berlusconi and by his conflation of liberty with libertinism: he warped the country's democracy into a strange sort of videocracy, complete with showgirls in parliament and bunga-bunga at home.</p> <p>Quite what comes next is still unclear. The presence of an apolitical tecnocrat, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/30/mario-monti-carnival-meagre-diet-lent\" title=\"\">Mario Monti</a>, as PM disguises the fact that there is a political vacuum in the country and, with a general election next year, various politicians are now fighting to fill it.</p> <p>The most pugnacious is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beppe_Grillo\" title=\"\">Beppe Grillo</a>. A diminutive comedian in his mid-60s with hair like a shredded sheep, Grillo is a furious orator who represents the anger of the Italian electorate. At huge rallies, he screams into the microphone as he bemoans the epic salaries, perks, criminal records and acts of collusion of the traditional elites. Although he eschews the mainstream media, he's got a large online following and isn't averse to pulling off stunts, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/10/beppe-grillo-sicily-election-campaign\" title=\"\">such as his swim</a>, last week, across the strait of Messina to start his campaign in Sicily (where he's moving around in a campervan).</p> <p>Grillo's movement \u2013 he prefers \"movement\" to \"party\" \u2013 is called the Five Stars Movement (M5S). To general astonishment, it took more than 20% of the vote in some parts of the country last May, even winning the prized mayoral position in Parma. M5S is currently polling ahead of Berlusconi's party in regional elections in Lazio, meaning that the <em>sans-culottes</em> satirist is now taken very seriously. Another pretender is Matteo Renzi, the 37-year-old Tuscan who has already been president of the province of Florence and mayor of the city. He is now running against the leader of the left-wing Democratic Party in upcoming primaries and is nicknamed the <em>rottamatore</em>(scrapper), because of his disdain for Italy's gerontocracy and for the way in which the same old faces play parliamentary musical chairs. On the left, too, is Nichi Vendola, currently president of the Puglia region. Gay, communist, with an earring and slight lisp, Vendola has frequently been a refreshingly honest voice in a bland landscape. The only doubt is whether he could ever become sufficiently mainstream for national elections.</p> <p>The real vacuum is on the right. Berlusconi and Umberto Bossi, who has resigned as leader of the Northern League, leave big boots to fill, and in their absence anyone else looks like a political pygmy. Berlusconi has, officially at least, handed over the reigns of his party to Angelino Alfano, a bald Sicilian who, born on Halloween, looks like something from the Addams family. Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, an aristocrat, former Confindustria (CBI) chief and now chairman of Ferrari, has an \"association\" called Italia Futura, but it has explicitly endorsed Mario Monti for a second term in office.</p> <p>In many ways the situation is remarkably similar to the unstable period between the first and second republics. As happened then, a tidal wave of corruption scandals \u2013 this time involving the presidents of Lazio and Lombardy, among others \u2013 have disgusted, if not surprised, the electorate. There's a controversial president of the republic (Giorgio Napolitano). There's a longing for fresh faces and new ideas.</p> <p>But that very similarity should act as a warning to those who hope that this new republic will be any different from those that came before. Everyone in Italy knows about <em>gattopardismo</em>, the notion made famous by Lampedusa's novel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/may/03/featuresreviews.guardianreview22\" title=\"\">The Leopard</a>, whereby superficial personnel changes allow everything to remain exactly as before. The other perennial habit of Italian politics, <em>trasformismo</em>, means something comparable: that left and right are forever blurred and that change merely masks continuity. One Italian historian, Guido Crainz, wrote recently about how all opposition in Italy eventually gets co-opted into the mainstream, sucked into compromise and the <em>Marmellatona</em> \u2013 the \"massive jam\" \u2013 of Italian political life. Never, it seems, is there a clean break with the past and its practices.</p> <p>So it's salutary to remember that those embroiled in recent Italian corruption scandals \u2013 Bettino Craxi, Silvio Berlusconi and Umberto Bossi \u2013 were once beacons of invigorating idealism, just as Beppe Grillo ,Matteo Renzi and Nichi Vendola are today. In Italy, new brooms always seem to learn old tricks as they realise that, sadly, you just can't sweep jam.</p>",

  "<p>The United Nations is to set up a dedicated investigations unit in Geneva early next year to examine the legality of drone attacks in cases where civilians are killed in so-called \"targeted\" counter-terrorism operations.</p> <p>The announcement was made by Ben Emmerson QC, a UN special rapporteur, in a speech to Harvard law school in which he condemned secret rendition and waterboarding as crimes under international law. His forthright comments, directed at both US presidential candidates, will be seen as an explicit challenge to the prevailing US ideology of the global war on terror.</p> <p>Earlier this summer, Emmerson, who monitors counter-terrorism for the UN, called for effective investigations into drone attacks. Some US drone strikes in Pakistan may amount to war crimes, Emmerson warned.</p> <p>In his Harvard speech, he said: \"If the relevant states are not willing to establish effective independent monitoring mechanisms \u2026 then it may in the last resort be necessary for the UN to act.</p> <p>\"Together with my colleague Christof Heyns, [the UN special rapporteur on extra-judicial killings], I will be launching an investigation unit within the special procedures of the [UN] Human Rights Council to inquire into individual drone attacks.\"</p> <p>The investigation unit will also look at \"other forms of targeted killing conducted in counter-terrorism operations, in which it is alleged that civilian casualties have been inflicted\". Emmerson maintained that the US stance that it can conduct counter-terrorism operations against al-Qaida or other groups anywhere in the world because it is deemed to be an international conflict was indefensible.</p> <p>\"The global war paradigm has done immense damage to a previously shared international consensus on the legal framework underlying both international human rights law and international humanitarian law,\" he said. \"It has also given a spurious justification to a range of serious human rights and humanitarian law violations.</p> <p>\"The [global] war paradigm was always based on the flimsiest of reasoning, and was not supported even by close allies of the US. The first-term Obama administration initially retreated from this approach, but over the past 18 months it has begun to rear its head once again, in briefings by administration officials seeking to provide a legal justification for the drone programme of targeted killing in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia \u2026</p> <p>\"[It is] alleged that since President Obama took office at least 50 civilians were killed in follow-up strikes when they had gone to help victims and more than 20 civilians have also been attacked in deliberate strikes on funerals and mourners. Christof Heyns \u2026 has described such attacks, if they prove to have happened, as war crimes. I would endorse that view.\"</p> <p>Emmerson singled out both President Obama and the Republican challenger Mitt Romney for criticism. \"It is perhaps surprising that the position of the two candidates on this issue has not even featured during their presidential elections campaigns, and got no mention at all in Monday night's foreign policy debate.</p> <p>\"We now know that the two candidates are in agreement on the use of drones. But the issue of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques is an one which, according to the record, continues to divide them.</p> <p>\"I should make it absolutely clear that my mandate does not see to eye to eye with the Obama administration on a range of issues \u2013 not least the lack of transparency over the drone programme. But on this issue the president has been clear since he took office that water-boarding is torture that it is contrary to American values and that it would stop.</p> <p>\"... But Governor Romney has said that he does not believe that waterboarding is torture. He has said that he would allow enhanced interrogation techniques that go beyond those now permitted by the army field manual, and his security advisers have recommended that he rescind the existing restrictions.\"</p> <p>The Cambodian dictator Pol Pot, he pointed out, used the technique. \"Anyone who is in doubt about whether waterboarding is torture should visit Tuol Sleng, the infamous S-21 detention facility operated by the Khymer Rouge in Phnom Penh.</p> <p>\"Over a period of four years 14,000 people were systematically tortured and killed there. It is now a genocide museum. And right there, in the middle of the central torturing room, is the apparatus used by Pol Pot's security officials for waterboarding.\"</p>",
  "<p>All but unnoticed by the wider world, Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, held an unscheduled t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate last week with the US's most despised bogeyman, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran.</p> <p>Given deep disagreements over Syria, and Iranian anger at Turkey's decision to allow the US to deploy missile defence systems on its soil, <a href=\"http://breakingnews.sy/en/article/9247.html\" title=\"\">the meeting at a regional economic summit in Baku, Azerbaijan, was something of a surprise</a>.</p> <p>Neither man gave much away after the encounter, but officials said ways of defusing the Syrian crisis were discussed. After a year or more of backing opposing sides, and with a military solution apparently beyond the reach of both Bashar al-Assad's regime and Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebels, Iran and Turkey have a shared interest in calming things down.</p> <p>The Syrian regime's reported agreement, strongly backed by Iran and Turkey, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20066613\" title=\"\">to begin a limited truce this weekend</a> may be one result of this new approach. It also reflects a changing Turkish stance that puts new emphasis on forging a regional solution to the Syrian impasse in the absence of effective US, UN or other international action.</p> <p>Turkey has been badly burned by the Syrian conflagration and feels let down by Washington and its European Nato allies, who have rebuffed its calls for border buffer areas, no-fly zones and armed humanitarian intervention. It has all but given up hope that either a re-elected Barack Obama or Mitt Romney will show a stronger lead.</p> <p>An estimated 150,000 Syrian refugees have flooded over Turkey's southern frontier. Trade with Syria, once worth an annual $2.5bn (\u00a31.5bn), has dwindled to a trickle. Resulting economic hardship and political instability in Hatay and other Turkish border provinces, home to <a href=\"http://www.todayszaman.com/news-291247-group-tries-to-recruit-hatay-alevis-into-assad-army.html\" title=\"\">large numbers of Arab Alevis who identify with Syria's ruling Alawite minority</a>, has rung alarm bells in Ankara.</p> <p>\"Turkish policy on Syria was thrown into total confusion by Assad's refusal to stand down last year,\" said Cengiz Aktar, a leading Turkish commentator. \"They were expecting him to go the way of Mubarak [in Egypt] and Gaddafi [in Libya], or better still Ben Ali [the Tunisian president who fled into exile]. But nothing of the kind happened \u2026 The US and Europe were not prepared to back any military operations and the Russians were doing their own thing \u2026 Turkey ran out of options.\"</p> <p>To make matters worse, Turkish officials are convinced the Syrian regime, retaliating for Turkish support for the FSA, is aiding and abetting Kurdistan Workers' party (PKK) separatist fighters, whose terror attacks on targets in south-east Turkey are at a 10-year high.</p> <p>The PKK's Syrian offshoot, the Party of Unity and Democracy (PYD), which claims to represent Syria's Kurdish minority, has also profited from the chaos. Turkey worries the PYD may try to set up an autonomous region in northern Syria, akin to Massoud Barzani's Kurdistan regional government (KRG) in northern Iraq.</p> <p>\"Particularly alarming was the capture of several towns along the Turkish border by the PYD,\" said Gonul Tol, of the Centre for Turkish Studies at the Middle East Institute. \"Turkey watched nervously as Kurdish groups took control of the towns after the withdrawal of Assad forces and hoisted the Kurdish flag over Syrian government buildings, along with posters of the PKK's imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan,\" <a href=\"http://mideast.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/08/29/syrias_kurdish_challenge_to_turkey\" title=\"\">Tol wrote</a>.</p> <p>Ahmet Davutoglu, Turkey's foreign minister, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/19/turkey-britain-us-intervene-syria\" title=\"\">told the Guardian in an interview conducted last week</a>: \"When the regime has withdrawn from certain places in Syria, sometimes they are giving weapons or other means to let the PKK control those parts of Syria \u2026 The PKK is trying to use the chaotic situation in the region for their own activities.\"</p> <p>A recent spate of incidents along the 560-mile border has reinforced the impression the situation is spinning out of control. Turkish and Syrian military units exchanged fire repeatedly after a Syrian shell killed five Turkish civilians in a border town earlier this month.</p> <p>And a huge diplomatic row broke out last week after Turkish fighter jets forced down a Syrian passenger plane en route from Russia to Damascus. Turkey <a href=\"http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-fm-defends-ankaras-decision-to-ground-syrian-plane.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=33130&amp;NewsCatID=338\" title=\"\">claimed the plane was carrying</a> military equipment, an allegation furiously denied in Moscow.</p> <p>Security issues aside, Syria has become a massive political headache. Erdogan and Davutoglu have been heavily criticised for first engaging with Assad last year, in the belief they could talk him round, and then going to the other extreme this year, noisily demanding his resignation when they lacked the means to enforce it.</p> <p>\"They were naive. They bet that Assad would fall. And they were wrong,\" said a former national newspaper editor. \"Erdogan is frustrated. He feels Assad sold him out. He takes everything personally.\"</p> <p>Capitalising on opinion polls that show a large majority of Turks fears a war with Syria and opposes any kind of intervention, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, leader of the main opposition Republican People's party (CHP), rounded on Davutoglu, saying his famous policy of \"zero problems with neighbours\", adopted in 2002 as Ankara sought to re-establish itself as a regional superpower, was a flop.</p> <p>Kilicdaroglu said Turkey was isolated over Syria, with only Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the KRG in Iraq and Hamas on its side. Against it were ranged Russia, China, Iran, Brazil and India.</p> <p>\"How can we describe the policy that put Turkey into this situation?\" <a href=\"http://www.kurdpress.com/En/NSite/FullStory/News/?Id=2695#Title=CHP%20leader%20criticized%20Turkey%20foreign%20policy,%20calls%20FM%20%18an%20idiot%19\" title=\"\">Kilicdaroglu asked</a>. \"Is this 'strategic depth' [a favourite Davutoglu concept] or strategic blindness? The process that resulted in Turkey becoming part of such a meaningless balance comes from a foreign minister whose incompetence is known by the entire world \u2026 You have to be a real idiot to do that.\"</p> <p>Clear signs are now emerging that the government is changing tack, and that by mending fences with neighbours such as Iran, Russia, and maybe even Nouri al-Maliki's Iraq, it hopes to forge a binding Syrian solution that is guaranteed by the regional powers and bridges what at present is a growing Sunni-Shia sectarian divide. Part of this new approach, outlined by Erdogan, is to establish a set of parallel talks mechanisms bringing together Egypt and Saudi Arabia, which want Assad to resign, and Russia and Iran, who have resisted forced regime change.</p> <p>Welcoming the move, the H\u00fcrriyet columnist Semih Idiz said Turkish policy on Syria had become a \"rudderless ship\" and a course correction was long overdue. \"This represents a significant shift in position by Ankara&#xa0;\u2026 It was no more than a few months ago that Ankara looked coolly on any discussion on Syria which involved Russia and Iran,\" <a href=\"http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-changes-tack-on-syria.aspx?pageID=449&amp;nID=32739&amp;NewsCatID=416\" title=\"\">Idiz said</a>.</p> <p>Intriguingly, this revamped region-based approach may include a rapprochement with Israel. Ties ruptured in 2010 amid a bitter row over the deaths of nine Turkish activists aboard a Gaza aid flotilla that was stormed by Israeli commandos. Alarmed at events across its disputed Golan Heights border, Israel has put out diplomatic feelers, suggesting that at this time of crisis, Tel Aviv and Ankara should set aside old differences and work together.</p> <p>Pinhas Avivi, a senior Israeli foreign ministry official and former ambassador to Turkey, offered bilateral talks on Syria this week. Turkey's public response has been cool so far, but <a href=\"http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4295593,00.html\" title=\"\">political insiders say Ankara has a strong interest in making up</a>.</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian, Ahmet Davutoglu, Turkey's foreign minister, said Turkey had always believed in a regional approach and was optimistic Russia, for example, with which he was maintaining regular high-level contacts, could be part of a solution.</p> <p>While flatly rejecting suggestions his Syria policy had failed, he was adamant Assad would have to step down if a lasting settlement were to be secured. He said: \"Every day I am asking myself, what more could be done to prevent this bloodshed. We have done everything&#xa0;\u2026 We have tried bilateral engagement with the regime to persuade them [to have] a transition process and help them go to a democratic system \u2026</p> <p>\"For several months we tried, even before the Arab spring \u2026 We went to Damascus last August [2011] \u2026 He [Assad] accepted our step-by-step plan but after two, three days he did not fulfil his promise&#xa0;\u2026 We realised he was cheating us and trying to misuse his relationship with us.</p> <p>\"Still we have regional engagement with Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia&#xa0;\u2026 What else can we do? I think it would not be ethical at all to continue business as usual&#xa0;\u2026 Ethically and strategically our policy has been right. Ethically it is right because we are on the side of human rights, we are on the side of the rightful aspirations of Syrian people. Strategically it is right because we are on the right side of history.</p> <p>\"At the end of the day, this regime cannot continue the way it is, and the new elected government of Syria will be the best friend of Turkey.\"</p>",

He represents a thorn in the side of the mainstream with his messages about class struggle, religion, government and institutional racism.</p> <p>He is currently touring the UK and will be performing with <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/lowkeyuk\" title=\"\">Lowkey</a> \u2013 a British hip-hop artist and activist \u2013 at a sold-out Electric Brixton tonight.</p> <p><strong>What are the themes of your music?</strong></p> <p>A better response is: go on the internet and steal all my music and listen to it. If it speaks to you, then feel free to support me. But if you want a real answer to that question, I'd say that the music I make is very personal, passionate and tells a story of sacrifice. There are a lot of historical and political references. People ask me: 'Why do you rap about politics?' I've always tried to reflect real life in my music and go beyond the experience of the inner-city ghetto of America. I like to have multiple dimensions in my music.</p> <p><strong>What do you make of Lowkey and the political/conscious hip-hop scene in the UK?</strong></p> <p>It's a very positive thing to have multiple dimensions to any hip-hop scene. So I always think the voice of reason is great to have. People such as Lowkey and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/artist/759d2090-c396-492a-90fd-2586a50d48cd\" title=\"\">Akala</a> rap about real life. Reality rap is what I call it. I think the UK has a rich culture of immigrants who are coming from Africa and Asia and share experiences that are so unique, it's only right that they document it and recount their struggles too. Without that diversity you're going to end up like we did in the States, and I hope that never happens. We are fighting a real guerrilla war in America in terms of getting independent music out, getting out music with a message. They are resisting. We've found a home-base to fight from in the jungle. They've found it too hard to wipe us out; we're not going anywhere.</p> <p><strong>Who is resisting and why are they doing it?</strong></p> <p>It's more the industry. There are forces within the industry who like very much what I do. Why? Because it's a money-maker. It's more people who see the music I make as a threat to the status quo of hip-hop. They don't want people to hear about Palestine, slavery or torture. They want us to just dance and sing and smile and pretend that the world is OK. They believe hip-hop is sheer entertainment. Entertainment can be used for many things: to inspire and educate but also to pacify, to keep people stupid and preoccupied with things that aren't important.</p> <p><strong>Where does the anger in your music come from?</strong></p> <p>I think it's righteous fury. If someone shot your mother you'd be angry, right? But would you be wrong for being angry? No. I've heard people criticise me for the most ridiculous things, calling my music abrasive. If you're troubled by the words I speak, then you should probably hang yourself because the world is going to tear you apart or is too real for you to accept. I'm not offended by fuck, shit, pussy, dick, motherfucker. You know what I'm offended by? I'm offended by seeing a child in Gaza who has had his skin burned off by white phosphorus. I'm offended by seeing the graves of civilians that are there because they are the \"collateral damage\" of a drone strike in Afghanistan or Pakistan. I'm offended when I see people perverting Christianity, Islam or Judaism for their own political purposes so they can justify taking land or killing people in the name of something.</p> <p><strong>How have you evolved as an artist since your first album, </strong><a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/revolutionary-vol-1-mw0000375543\" title=\"\"><strong>Revolutionary Vol 1</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p> <p>I just used to write rhymes in my mind and then I tried to find beats to fit them. By <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/revolutionary-vol-2-mw0000695711\" title=\"\">Vol 2</a> I was mastering and perfecting the flow and by <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-3rd-world-mw0000788879\" title=\"\">The Third World</a> album my flow had a developed a lot more. I had to learn to breathe with my diaphragm rather than my lungs. I learned to expand my arms so I get the extra 10% of breath that opera singers do when they sing. I had to go to a breathing coach, and there is no shame in that. If [rapping] is your instrument, learn how to use it.</p> <p><strong>Who are your musical influences?</strong></p> <p>Most of my lyrical influences came from people who didn't really do hip-hop. Like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/malcolm-x\" title=\"\">Malcolm X</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/muhammad-ali\" title=\"\">Muhammad Ali</a> \u2013 people who I thought were incredible speakers. But in terms of rap, I'm talking <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/artist/fc4568b6-cbe3-4a3d-8409-28510c19e3e2\" title=\"\">KRS-One</a>, Ice Cube, Chuck D, Kool G Rap, Big Daddy Kane, Slick Rick, Big Punisher, Lord Finesse, DITC.</p> <p><strong>What was involved in making the 2011 documentary film </strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hLJIH7ICJs\" title=\"\"><strong>The [R]evolution of Immortal Technique</strong></a><strong>, and what did you learn?</strong></p> <p>That I hate documentaries about my life but at the same time I loved making this. It was a seven-year-long project. We went everywhere. We did hip-hop shows from one corner of the Earth to another.</p> <p><strong>What places hit you the most?</strong></p> <p>Afghanistan in terms of seeing struggle, poverty and strife. But in Haiti after the earthquake, I saw some of the worst conditions in my life. I saw a 10-year-old girl who had become the surrogate mother of all these little three- and four-year-old girls whose parents had perished. She was feeding them and giving them water so they wouldn't die. That is a 10-year-old girl! There were four or five families in one tent. When I went to Peru I saw a 10-year-old girl prostituting herself on the street. That affects you differently.</p> <p><strong>What do you make of Obama's first term as president?</strong></p> <p>Why are we held prisoner by this two-party system when neither of them represents the true values of America? Romney's position is fairly deceptive. Obama painted him as a man who will say anything to get elected. That's what Romney is. Romney said he wasn't anti-abortion when he was governor of Massachusetts, then when he was running for the Republican party he is the most anti-abortion guy in the world. He said he would start a war with Iran but when he realised the economic and political reality of starting another war and how much America is against it, he began mirroring Obama's policy.</p> <p><strong>What should the world expect if Romney becomes president?</strong></p> <p>I think he would make it end up looking like [George W] Bush's third term as president. Obama is still a war president. He didn't shut down Guant\u00e1namo Bay; he deported more people than Bush did; he supposedly ended the war in Iraq just to expand in Afghanistan; he signed the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Defense_Authorization_Act\" title=\"\">National Defence Authorisation Act</a>, which is very draconian. I have a lot of problems in actively supporting someone like that.</p> <p><strong>In your song </strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Igt-jW4e8ts\" title=\"\"><strong>Point of No Return</strong></a><strong> you say the government is after you. How much truth is in that?</strong></p> <p>I've definitely had a lot of run-ins with the government. They have tried to do my father for taxes; they thought I was hiding money with him. I have had my passport confiscated and have been questioned by Homeland Security upon coming home \u2013 not from Afghanistan but anywhere in the world.</p> <p><strong>Do you see yourself making music forever?</strong></p> <p>In some capacity yes, but the soul has to develop in some form. I like writing books, stories and essays \u2013 I may do that. I use to teach ancient history in prison for children. I found a lot of gratification in that because I saw people's lives turn around.</p> <p><strong>Your lyrics contain a lot of religious messages. What does religion mean to you and do you follow a faith?</strong></p> <p>If I told people I was a Muslim, people wouldn't say: \"Wow, that's wonderful you've found inner peace in your life by embracing Islam.\" They'd ask: \"What type of Muslim are you? Are you one of them fucking Wahabbi, Sunnite, Salafi psycho-niggas? Are you down with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/hezbollah\" title=\"\">Hezbollah</a> and them?\" If I told people I was Jewish, they'd ask: \"Do you support Israel and do you support the colonisation of Palestine?\" It's irrelevant whether you call yourself a Christian, Muslim or Jew because if you don't reflect that in your life, you aren't that at all. I have always been hounded by people about it; people try and pry it out of me. I believe in God and have a faith that's very personal to me. That faith is between me and God. We have polarised religion, rather than it being a personal reflection of your relationship with God and how you communicate with God. I'd rather be friends with a good atheist than a bad religious person. Your religion is suppose to ennoble you, but if all it makes you do is become contemptuous of other people, or make you say other people are going to hell, your religion has failed you, or rather, you have failed your religion.</p> <p><strong>What struggles do you face with being a \"reality rap\" artist and people trying to pinpoint any sort of hypocrisy in your life?</strong></p> <p>I don't shy away from anything. As human beings, we're all works in progress. If I can get some constructive criticism, you're helping me grow as a human being. Sometimes I realise I need to grow. It happened with me trying to take the word bitch more out of my music. I'm not a \"gay-rights champion\", but if I'm going to talk about people being oppressed in my music, then aren't some people oppressed if they don't have the right to marry the person they want in a society that's supposed to be free? They shouldn't be punished by a government because of the way they are born.</p> <p><strong>Do you feel a lot of your music is about conspiracies?</strong></p> <p>I wouldn't call it conspiracy. I would suggest people research \u2013 for example when I said Bin Laden was part of the CIA and people said \"that's not true\". There was a poll in the US and it showed less than 15% knew Bin Laden knew was employed by US. When people say it's a conspiracy I welcome the criticism, because the music I make is backed by historical facts. I'm not afraid to be wrong or debate it. I won't allow people to marginalise my music.</p> <p><strong>What do you do in your spare time?</strong></p> <p>Read, sleep, work out, box, spend time with people I love.</p> <p><strong>Why do you use the N-word so frequently?</strong></p> <p>I would say I use it less frequently than I have before. I have made a conscious decision to replace it in the music I make. I understand a lot of people have used that word to express camaraderie. In the States we remade the word to be something that reflected unity among ourselves. I think it was a confidence-builder and a way of showing that hip-hop could supersede any of the stereotypes thrown on top of them. The only problem is that when it became corporatised, someone else decided what those stereotypes would be replaced with.</p> <p><strong>Will you continue to use the word?</strong></p> <p>I think eventually I will have to phase it out. I don't want to be 50 years old and yelling to my children like that. I think what people need to keep in mind is the way individuals are introduced to that word is incredibly unique for everybody's experience. There is a certain power in reclaiming language.</p> <p><strong>Do you ever see yourself starting a family?</strong></p> <p>I was born with the disease I inherited from my father \u2013 it's called responsibility. It prevents me from dropping seeds in random women and not taking care of children like a man should. When it's time for me to have a family, I intend to dedicate my life to that. It's hard to juggle that as an artist and a revolutionary.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1012/82860.html\">Colin Powell's endorsement of Barack Obama</a> won't swing many votes. It has come too late to an electorate too divided and in an atmosphere too poisoned to even be heard properly, let alone persuade anyone. (Though, were he to stump for Obama in Virginia's military towns, he might make some waves.)</p> <p>Since Powell endorsed Obama in 2008, it is not a surprise. And the endorsement he gave this time this time around was sound but not soaring.</p> <p>\"I think, generally, we've come out of the dive and we're starting to gain altitude,\" <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=50133837n\">he told CBS's Good Morning</a>. \"It doesn't mean all our problems are solved.\"</p> <p>While it may not be decisive, it is nonetheless indicative. For Powell is a Republican without a party. The man who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/06/iraq.comment\">sold the Iraq war to the United Nations</a> as George W Bush's secretary of state is no liberal. He has not yet left the party with which he has identified for much of his adult life, but clearly, he feels that it has left him:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I think I'm a Republican of more moderate mould and that's something of a dying breed, I'm sorry to say. But, you know, the Republicans I worked for are President Reagan, President Bush, the Howard Bakers of the world, people who were conservative, people who were willing to push their conservative views, but people who recognize that, at the end of the day, you got to find a basis for compromise. Compromise is how this country runs.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/23/romney-us-presidential-elections-republicans\">Romney was once of a similar breed</a>. It's actually the breed he's been trying to emulate most recently, and which has served him so well as he distances himself from the reactionary demagoguery of the primaries and seeks to present himself as more reasonable, considered candidate \u2013 who is not a \"severe\" conservative but a compassionate one. </p> <p><a href=\"http://crooksandliars.com/john-amato/pat-buchanan-says-colin-powell-endorsed\">Claims that Powell is only supporting Obama</a> \"because he is black\" are as reductive as they are ridiculous. If race were the sole or even principal guide for his politics, Powell wouldn't have been among the handful of black Americans who supported the Ronald Reagan of \"welfare queens\" or the Bush senior of Willie Horton infamy.</p> <p>Powell left the George W Bush administration disaffected at the impact of neoconservatives on foreign policy and the general drift towards the right on social and economic policy, saying also that his presentation in favour of the war at the UN had left \"a painful blot\" on his record. The Republicans have only got more rightwing since then, and many of those who advised Bush are now on Team Romney.</p> <p>While Powell professed the \"utmost respect\" for Romney, he nevertheless sees him conflicted between the demands of his conservative base and the those of the real world, saying:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The governor who was speaking on Monday night at the debate was saying things that were quite different from what he said earlier. I'm not quite sure which Governor Romney we would be getting with respect to foreign policy. I don't sense he's thought through these issues as thoroughly as he should have. He gets advice from his campaign staff that he then has to modify as he goes along.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The Romney who ran Massachusetts as governor might have chosen Powell as a running-mate. Powell might even have accepted. But that Romney only exists in its most fleeting, Etch-a-Sketchiest form.</p> <p>The party Powell identifies with is the one Romney's father, George, tried to defend at the ultra-conservative convention that nominated Barry Goldwater. Back then, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2011/10/31/141857420/new-republic-mitt-romneys-parent-trap\">Gerald Ford symbolically nominated George from the floor</a>, with the praise:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"He has never let the temporary glitter of expediency obscure the path which his integrity dictated he must follow.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>No one could ever say that of Romney. The context may change but the notion that a candidate should stand for something other than office remains. Lacking a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_Souljah_moment\">Sister Souljah moment</a> during which he might have taken on his own side, Romney has shown himself to be a prisoner to his increasingly eccentric and extreme base. Whether it's <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/25/mourdocks-comments-pose-dilemma-for-romney/\">GOP Senate candidates Richard Mourdock</a> and <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/aug/19/news/la-pn-rep-todd-akin-no-pregnancy-from-legitimate-rape-20120819\">Todd Akin</a> disparaging rape survivors, <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2012/03/rush_limbaugh_calls_sandra_fluke_a_slut_how_sex_positivity_has_recharged_the_feminist_movement_.html\">Rush Limbaugh referring to Georgetown student Sandra Fluke</a> as a \"slut\" and a \"prostitute\" after she spoke in support of mandating insurance coverage for contraception, or Donald Trump demanding Obama's college transcripts, Romney has chosen polite distance over forthright denunciation, preferring to cajole than confront.</p> <p>Before he walked out of the 1964 convention, George Romney said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"There is no place in either of our parties for the purveyors of hate.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Powell's endorsement of Obama signals that we are a step closer to seeing the extinction of a breed for which there is clearly a market, but which Republicans are no longer keen to produce.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow Gary Younge on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/garyyounge\">Twitter</a></p>",
  "<p>John Long couldn't bring himself to vote in the last presidential election. The head of Florida's Tea Party movement despised John McCain and Barack Obama in equal measure.</p> <p>But next month Long will cast a ballot for Mitt Romney even though he regards the Republican presidential candidate as carrying much of the same baggage as McCain. The crucial difference for Long, who is pastor of a church set up for construction workers at Disneyland, is that after four years of Obama he would vote for anyone else. Plus, Romney has one overriding asset.</p> <p>\"The vast majority of people wouldn't have voted for John McCain if he was running unopposed. He was the worst nominee in the history of the United States,\" said Long. \"Romney is better than McCain because McCain didn't have a lick of business sense. For all of the things over which Mitt Romney and I disagree, for all the ways in which he doesn't turn me on, I respect a man who promises to come to Washington and look at the United States government as a business. If Mitt Romney was an abortion supporter, if Mitt Romney favoured gay marriage, if he believed in global warming, I'd still be fine with him if he would go to Washington and run it like a business.\"</p> <p>That view is increasingly expressed, albeit in less trenchant form, by once wavering voters across Florida \u2013 among the most important of swing states for Romney because there is almost no chance of him taking the presidency without winning it.</p> <p>\"I've been in there asking for a job,\" said Bob Brachett, a 38-year-old unemployed man outside a Staples office supply store \u2013 the chain Romney turned into a successful nationwide operation. \"I did vote for Obama last time and I don't think he's a bad president or a bad man. I don't believe a lot of the things they say about him. But the jobs situation is very bad in Florida and I don't see Obama making it better. I'll take a chance on Romney.\"</p> <p>Various branches of the Republican party were for a long time wary of Romney because of what they called the \"3Ms\": Massachusetts, Mormons and money.</p> <p>Social conservatives recoiled from Romney in the Republican primaries because of his support as Massachusetts governor a decade ago for legal abortion and gay rights, and his engineering of healthcare reforms, including a legal requirement to buy medical insurance, which provided the model for Obama's healthcare overhaul.</p> <p>There was great suspicion within the Christian right, which regards Romney's Mormon faith as a cult.</p> <p>More pragmatic elements of the party leadership feared Romney's enormous wealth \u2013 he's worth about $250m \u2013 would cause many ordinary voters to discount him as out of touch with their problems.</p> <p>The Democrats certainly tried to exploit Romney's money: how he made it, where he banked it and how much tax he paid on it. The focus of the attack was Bain Capital, Romney's private equity firm, for shipping jobs to China. The Democrats also latched onto his shifting positions on abortion, gay rights and health care to portray him as insincere and desperate for power. At a campaign stop in Florida earlier this week, Obama repeatedly accused his opponent of being afflicted with \"Romnesia\", which causes him to forget his previous political positions.</p> <p>But less than a fortnight before the election all of that appears to count for less than the Democrats in Florida hoped.</p> <p>The key to the state is Hillsborough County, a fairly diverse area politically, economically and racially that includes the port city of Tampa. No presidential candidate has won the state since 1960 without taking Hillsborough.</p> <p>Obama carried the county with 53% of the vote in 2008, the same margin of victory for George Bush four years earlier.</p> <p>The chairman of Hillsborough's Republican party, Art Wood, is cautious in predicting which way it will go this time. But he regards the election as \"dramatically different\" from four years ago when Republicans found McCain \"hard to embrace\".</p> <p>Wood said he had feared Romney faced the same problem, in part because of the 3Ms, until he shook up the election at the first presidential debate three weeks ago.</p> <p>\"The whole matrix Obama constructed about Romney collapsed with the debate. Obama was doing everything he can not to talk about his performance, not to talk about the economy. He spent months talking about how bad Romney was, how Romney hates women and Romney's in favour of tax cuts for the rich. Nasty labels. And then Romney starts talking and people see he's a decent guy,\" said Wood.</p> <p>\"He's raised five kids that are the all-American family and Obama was raised in Indonesia and Kenya. That matrix, that charade, that whole story he constructed about Romney \u2026 it just started collapsing. It wasn't that Romney was more persuasive. It was that what so many voters thought about Romney collapsed.\"</p> <p>Part of Romney's support is constructed on a visceral dislike of Obama with overtones of racism. Among the more popular Republican campaign signs is: Take Our Country Back.</p> <p>Evangelical preachers have for months been telling their congregations that abstaining in 2008 because they did not like McCain was a disaster that let Obama slip into the White House with an un-American agenda. The message has gone out that not voting is a vote for Obama. The Christian right has embraced it and set aside concerns about Romney's religion and earlier positions on abortion and gay rights.</p> <p>But if Romney takes Florida it will be because of the bounce in the polls that followed the first presidential debate. Romney went from up to nine percentage points behind just a week earlier to <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/fl/florida_romney_vs_obama-1883.html\">seven points ahead after the first debate</a>.</p> <p>Obama has since narrowed the gap but Romney retains a consistent lead. With the battering to the president's attempts to paint his opponent as incapable and out of touch, many Florida voters appear to have given the Republican candidate a second look.</p> <p>Political scientists say research shows a strengthening support for Romney among women worried about jobs and the impact of the economic crisis on their families.</p> <p>Latinos in Florida voted 57% for Obama four years ago. Now Romney is two percentage points up with them \u2013 despite Obama's claim on Wednesday that they would swing the election in his favour.</p> <p>\"Hispanics are basically Republicans \u2013 except when you get to the immigration issue,\" said Wood. \"What I believe is happening is the Hispanics are willing to make the immigration issue a second-tier issue this time around. It's not that it isn't very important but they realise the matter of jobs is more important this time.\"</p> <p>Wood said the shift since the first debate energised Republicans into believing that perhaps, after all, their man could win.</p> <p>\"There were an incredible number of Republicans [who] stayed home four years ago. The signs are that many of them will now vote,\" he said.</p> <p>Margaret Iuculano, a Republican candidate for county commissioner, said she has knocked on 30,000 doors campaigning over the past year.</p> <p>\"Early on there was a ton of indecisiveness out there. I've seen just a huge turn in the past weeks. Plenty of soft Democrats are voting for Romney,\" she said. \"People are much more educated on some of the issues. Jobs. It's always jobs. It's Romney's business experience that plays well. I have a lot of those conversations.</p> <p>\"I'm praying that what I see is factual and not wishful thinking, but I definitely see a surge in energy. I walked a neighbourhood last weekend with a lot of Republicans who hadn't voted in elections. We knocked on a lot of doors and they mostly said they were coming out to vote. We have to see if they do.\"</p> <p>Democrats have dismissed Republicans claims of a surge in support as \"bluster\", and say they have a well organised \"ground game\" to get supporters out when early voting begins on Saturday that will ultimately deliver the state to Obama. But Democratic activists concede that there does not appear to be the same level of enthusiasm among young voters as there was in 2008 when Obama relied heavily on support in college towns in Florida to win the state.</p> <p>The Democratic strategy to highlight the threat to Medicare \u2013 the government healthcare programme for the elderly \u2013 if Romney is elected also appears not to have had the impact the party hoped in Florida.</p> <p>Susan MacManus, a former chair of the Florida elections commission and a University of South Florida professor of political science, said that is in part because many retired people in the state, who often only move to Florida during the winter for the sun, are prosperous.</p> <p>\"Compared to a senior in Philadelphia or Detroit, the seniors here are younger, healthier, wealthier, better educated. Not as dependent upon Medicare. Plus you also have to take into consideration: seniors vote 42% registered Republicans, 41% Democrats and the rest no party affiliation. They're sticking to their candidate on Medicare. They're not threatened by it,\" she said.</p> <p>MacManus said that her research shows that many retirees are more likely to be concerned about the economy.</p> <p>\"A huge problem for a lot of older voters is the debt. Suddenly they're getting a call from a frantic adult child saying I'm going to lose my home, I can't make they mortgage payment, I lost my job. Retirees were shocked America could be headed toward another great depression. The deficit is a bigger issue here and it's very motivating to people. They really worry about the economic direction of the country,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>Eighty chief executives, from companies including Microsoft, JP Morgan and GE, have waded into the presidential election campaign with a call on Washington to use tax increases and spending cuts to address the US's $16tn debt.</p> <p>The intervention, less than two weeks before election day, comes as Barack Obama and Mitt Romney have faced criticism for the scant details of their financial plans to tackle America's massive debt. According to the CEOs, no solution can be found without tax hikes, which Romney opposes, and cuts to public spending.</p> <p>The letter has been signed by many of the biggest names in US business, including Steve Ballmer, CEO of Microsoft, JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon, and Lloyd Blankfein at Goldman Sachs. According to the signatories, any plan has to \"include comprehensive and pro-growth tax reform, which broadens the base, lowers rates, raises revenues and reduces the deficit\" as well as limiting the growth spending in areas including healthcare.</p> <p>\"Policymakers should acknowledge that our growing debt is a serious threat to the economic wellbeing and security of the United States,\" says the letter, put out by nonpartisan lobby group Fix The Debt.</p> <p>\"It is urgent and essential that we put in place a plan to fix America's debt. An effective plan must stabilize the debt as a share of the economy, and put it on a downward path.\"</p> <p>The CEOs are stepping into a debate that has caused gridlock in Washington. At the end of the year, Bush-era tax cuts are set to expire and draconian spending cuts will be imposed unless a political solution is found. The so-called \"fiscal cliff\" could plunge the US back into recession, according to the Congressional Budget Office.</p> <p>Romney and his running mate Paul Ryan have signed a pledge with lobby group Americans for Tax Reform not to increase taxes.</p> <p>Obama has proposed raising the marginal income-tax rates for the top 2% of taxpayers. None of the CEOs endorse that plan either, and have instead called for an overhaul of the tax code that would eliminate or reduce deductions, credits and loopholes.</p> <p>The CEOs endorsed the bipartisan plan to tackle the deficit drawn up in 2010 by Republican Alan Simpson and Democrat Erskine Bowles. The Simpson-Bowles plan called for roughly $3 in spending cuts for every $1 in tax increases.</p> <p>\"When you talk about a $16tn debt, I don't see how you can avoid addressing both sides,\" said Randall Stephenson, CEO of AT&amp;T.</p> <p>\"The recommendations of the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles Commission, which saved $4tn and addressed all parts of the budget, provide an effective framework for such a plan,\" said the CEOs.</p> <p>\"The plan should be conducive to long-term economic growth, protect the vulnerable, include credible enforcement mechanisms to ensure that debt reduction is achieved and leave the next generation better.\"</p> <p>Gus Faucher, a senior macroeconomist at PNC Financial said the letter was unlikely to change the course of the debate before the election but in the long term he expected whoever is elected to be forced to look at both tax hikes and spending cuts.</p> <p>\"The big issue is how we pay for retiring babyboomers, and I don't think as a society we have really faced up to that yet. Nothing will get done until after the election but it's difficult to see a solution that only involved spending cuts,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>In the mess that is the current US political climate, the best person to lead Americans through the dense fog of a tanking economy and complicated foreign policy might be a man&#xa0;whose most famous companion led him, one stormy Christmas Eve, through the fog with a bright red nose. </p> <p>Nevada resident Santa Claus is running for president and he announced Wednesday that singer Tracy Chapman \u2013&#xa0;not Rudolph \u2013&#xa0;would be his choice for running mate.</p> <p>\"I haven't heard either of the big boys talk about anything with respect to children, so I'd like to use that as a platform to insinuate my views on children, their health, safety and welfare and that's what I meant by restoring America's heart and soul,\" Claus told the Guardian. \"We have presidents and candidates and all these other politicians that are really into the whole war machine, some other things that aren't particularly good for children in my view and I would like to see voters consider changing that.\" </p> <p>Voters in 15 states can write in Santa Claus as their nominee for president on the November ballot. This includes key swing states like Iowa and New Hampshire, which means in a best case scenario he could get 108 electoral votes and have an actual influence on the election. </p> <p>If elected, the first thing he would do in office is work towards the main cause he advocates for, children. \"I think I would probably streamline the fostering and adoption system, it only takes 10 minutes to do it and it doesn't cost any more than we're already spending on those systems,\" Claus said.</p> <p>Claus is an advocate for vulnerable children full-time and decided in 2008 he would like to see a change in how politicians address issues that affect children and would lead that change himself by running for president.</p> <p>\"I have a heart for children and their future and I think they are being left behind in a big way. I'd like to see that change,\" Claus said. </p> <p>From 2005 through 2007, he visited every governor's office in the country on Santa's Bless the Children Tour to speak with them about issues affecting children. He specifically mentioned the desire to consolidate the fostering and adoption files in different states and to streamline the record-keeping process. </p> <p>The politician's staff were receptive to his talking points, except for the office of former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, who did not like the Santa shtick. </p> <p>This is his second time running for president and he increased his focus on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TheSantaClaus\">social media</a> this election cycle, a move that has kept his campaigning costs under $200. </p> <p>Before becoming Santa Claus, he was as a communications consultant for the New York police department where he set up the first video unit for a law enforcement branch in the US. </p> <p>He now resides in the appropriately alpine Lake Tahoe. It was there that he decided to change his name to Santa Claus while walking to the post office. Claus is a monk and bishop and was praying to figure out how he could use his bearded Santa-like appearance to help children. He said he asked God if he should change his name and about 10 seconds later, a man yelled from a car: \"Santa, I love you.\" </p> <p>The next week, the man formerly known as Thomas O'Connor applied for a name change and he was Santa Claus less than a month later. Claus estimates he is one of a half dozen people with that name, though he couldn't get a straight answer from the social security administration to confirm. </p> <p>He also has a screen actors guild membership, which means he is the only person who can officially endorse products as Santa Claus. </p> <p>His chances of getting elected president are considerably low, even in the states where people might write in Santa Claus because they don't like other candidates without realizing an actual candidate has that name. </p> <p>\"As it happens, states that do permit the write-in candidates and recognize us don't count the ballots for us,\" Claus said. \"Unless we actually had a shot to win that particular state, they are not gonna bother with it \u2013 which I understand \u2013 but I don't appreciate it.\"</p> <p>And with the holiday season approaching, Claus has one last message for the electorate and non-voters alike: \"From Santa, the greatest gift you can give is love, not presents.\"</p>",
  "<p><em>This is a memo to all staff sent on Thursday by Arthur Sulzberger Jr, chairman of the New York Times Company</em></p> <p>Dear colleagues</p> <p>Our third-quarter results announced this morning reflect a challenging advertising environment in both print and digital, which was affected by a number of factors including uncertainty in the global economy, the rapidly changing habits of consumers and the increasing complexity and fragmentation of the digital advertising marketplace. We expect overall advertising revenue trends to be similar for the fourth quarter.</p> <p>On a better note, our results also reflect continued growth in our circulation revenues led by the ongoing expansion of our digital subscription base, both at the Times and the Globe. As of the end of September, paid digital subscriptions across our Company totalled 592,000, up 11% from the end of the second quarter.</p> <p>When you put it all together, the Times Company had an operating profit of $8.5m in the third quarter of 2012 compared with $21m in the same period of 2011. Excluding depreciation, amortisation and severance, operating profit was $34m in the third quarter of 2012 compared with $47.7m in the third quarter of 2011.</p> <p>There is much hard work ahead for all of us. We are aware of the challenging economic and business climate we face and over the past three months we have taken a number of decisive actions to better position our Company for the future. High among them is that Mark Thompson, the former director general of the BBC, will join us as our new president and CEO on 12 November.</p> <p>Second was our sale of the About Group, which will allow us to focus on the development and growth of our core brands. And in early October, our interest in Indeed.com was sold. The after-tax proceeds from these two sales further strengthened our liquidity and our financial flexibility.</p> <p>As you know, we are all focused on seeking and developing opportunities to broaden and deepen reader interaction. At the Times, due to your efforts, we have enhanced and continue to broaden our presence in video, mobile and social engagement. Our multifaceted coverage of the presidential election and the debates are excellent examples of this innovative work. We have also made strides in growing our global footprint, as illustrated by this month's announcement of our plans to launch a Portuguese-language site for readers in Brazil, one of the world's fastest growing economies.</p> <p>At the New England Media Group, BostonGlobe.com recently marked its one-year anniversary and continues to make steady progress in growing paid digital subscriptions. The team has implemented a variety of initiatives to increase reader interest and engagement, and to strengthen subscription opportunities. And the August launch of Boston.com's new live streaming radio station, RadioBDC, is just the latest of the site's ongoing efforts to broaden its reach in the market.</p> <p>I want to address a topic that has been on many people's minds. You no doubt have read the recent reports of a controversy regarding the BBC's decision in late 2011 to cancel a news story investigating allegations of sexual abuse and molestation by an on-air BBC talent, Jimmy Savile, who died last year. Mark has provided a detailed account of that matter, and I am satisfied that he played no role in the cancellation of the segment.</p> <p>In the months leading to our decision to bring Mark to the Times Company, Michael Golden, our vice-chairman, and I, along with the rest of our board of directors, got to know Mark very well. Our opinion was then and remains now that he possesses high ethical standards and is the ideal person to lead our company as we focus on growing our businesses through digital and global expansion. Some of you have already had the opportunity to meet Mark and many more of you will in the coming weeks and months. We are all looking forward to that day when he takes the helm.</p> <p>As you all instinctively know, but it is worth stating again, we will cover the Savile story with objectivity and rigour. Mark endorses that completely as do I. Both of us believe passionately in strong, objective journalism that operates without fear or favour, no matter what it is covering. We have dedicated a significant amount of resources to this story and this is evident by the coverage we have provided our readers.</p> <p>If you would like to hear more about our financial results, you can listen to the webcast of our earnings conference call here and you can review the company's full third-quarter earnings press release, including a reconciliation of our GAAP results.</p> <p>Thank you all for your continued dedication to our goal \u2013 to provide the highest quality news and information to our readers and advertisers \u2013 and for your focus on our future.</p> <p>Arthur</p>",
  "<p>As Val\u00e9rie Trierweiler tries to draw a line under the soap opera surrounding her private life with Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, her predecessor Carla Bruni has suggested it would be easier if she were married and not a mere presidential partner, re-opening the debate about the role of the French first lady.</p> <p>Bruni, the supermodel-turned-singer who married the then president Nicolas Sarkozy less than three months after meeting him, <a href=\"http://www.elle.fr/People/La-vie-des-people/News/Exclusif-Carla-Bruni-son-interview-verite-dans-ELLE-2232536\" title=\"\">told French Elle magazine</a>: \"I can only speak from my own experience but I think it's more simple to be the legitimate wife of the head of state than his partner. The French presidency is an official status that implies official situations. Maybe I'm wrong and their choice is modern, but for my part, I felt a real easing of the general concern about me when I married Nicolas. Curiously, it's through that private undertaking that I found my place in public life.\"</p> <p>Trierweiler, a journalist at Paris Match magazine, has been Hollande's partner for about seven years. Their relationship, dubbed a political \"psychodrama\", has been the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/27/books-francois-hollande-love-life\" title=\"\">source of intense scrutiny and a recent rush of books</a>. Trierweiler detonated a bombshell during the June parliamentary elections by tweeting her support for a dissident Socialist who was running against S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, Hollande's former partner and the mother of his four children. Since then, French news weeklies have run front pages about the Hollande-Trierweiler-Royal \"love triangle\" and the new Socialist president \u2013 once seen as a plodding \"Mr Normal\" \u2013 was depicted as having a private life more complex than the three-times-married Sarkozy.</p> <p>Hollande and Trierweiler have said that any discussion of marriage would be a private matter. Trierweiler is twice divorced and Hollande, who had a relationship of more than 20 years with Royal, has never married. A poll for VSD magazine after his election in May 2012 found 79% of French people felt it was \"of little importance\" that the presidential couple lived together without being married.</p> <p>Trierweiler <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/03/valrie-trierweiler-apologises-tweet-hollande?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">issued a mea culpa for the controversial tweet</a> as an opinion poll for VSD found 67% of French people had a negative view of her.</p> <p>Asked about the tweet, Bruni said she refused to judge Trierweiler: \"Who hasn't made mistakes in their life?\" But she added that Trierweiler's situation as first lady was a \"little hazy\" and haziness was \"not to be recommended at the highest levels of state\".</p> <p>Bruni, who has an album due in the spring, said she stopped performing gigs during Sarkozy's presidency, saying it didn't seem right to sing when confronted with a climate of \"unemployment, misery, difficulties\". Asked if Trierweiler, who writes a culture column for Paris Match and also has an office at the Elys\u00e9e, was right to continue working as a journalist, Bruni said: \"Does she have the choice? It's complex and difficult \u2026 Journalism is supposed to be a counter-power, that's one of its missions.\"</p> <p>Asked if the rightwing Sarkozy would return to frontline politics, Bruni said it was unlikely, \"although I'm not an expert on the movements of the political scene\".</p>",
  "<p>Zach Miller has his sales pitch down to a tee. A DVD with your team's season highlights, $10 (\u00a36) a pop. Individual player highlights, $5 (\u00a33) per game; for $20 (\u00a312), he'll throw in the whole season. Player recruitment services, demo videos for coaches, athletic programme promos: you name it, he'll sort it \u2013 just as long as you pre-order.</p> <p>Slick and professional, Miller is vice president for sales at California-based <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/eaglebusinessprogram/clients\" title=\"\">Eagle Eye</a>, a sports media firm. He's also a high school student. In fact, he counts the mother of one of his school's aspiring athletes as his first ever sale. \"I remember the satisfying feeling of placing a hefty check in my pocket\", he recalls. \"Before turning it in to the finance department.\"</p> <p>Miller is one of thousands of US teenagers who have participated in the <a href=\"http://www.ja.org/involved/involved_students_comp_n_america_co.shtml\" title=\"\">JA Company of the Year</a> competition. Designed by youth charity<a href=\"http://www.ja.org/\" title=\"\"> Junior Achievement</a>, the competition invites young people to build their enterprise skills by setting up their own company.</p> <p>\"This [the competition] gives them a great grounding and foundational understanding of what it takes to start and run a business,\" says Stephanie Bell, spokesperson for Junior Achievement (JA). \"Because they might have a great idea, but just not know how to go about getting it started.\"</p> <p>The impact on these young people's futures is self-evident. Bell cites a long list of successful entrepreneurs to have passed through the ranks of Junior Achievement. The ripples spread further too. Employment is one of the central issues in the current US presidential election campaign: how to create American jobs, and how to keep them. JA's Company of the Year taps into precisely that agenda.</p> <p>Bell adds: \"In the US, small businesses are the engine of job creation. JA believes in the importance of fostering an entrepreneurial spirit among young people \u2026 because frankly that's what is going to help the US remain competitive in the global market.\"</p> <p>Enterprise skills are only one aspect of JA's suite of two dozen programmes. The remainder focus on either work readiness or financial literacy. Employers regularly complain about young people being ill equipped for the world of work. Through its work with schools, JA seeks to tackle that criticism head-on.</p> <h2>Business buy-in</h2> <p>One of the critical reasons behind the charity's long-running success (it's been going since 1919) lies in its ability to engage the business community. Companies not only help to financially support the work of the charity's 121 offices across the US, but they donate staff time too.</p> <p>AT&amp;T is one such example. Under its newly-launched AT&amp;T Aspire Mentoring Academy, the US communications firm aims to provide one million hours of mentoring support over the next five years \u2013 much of that delivered by working with Junior Achievement.</p> <p>One of the academy's core activities is a job-mentoring programme, which sees groups of high school students spend a day at the company's offices. As well as gaining a taste of the workplace and career advice, the students are set a business problem to solve.</p> <p>\"The problem is set around a real-life issue that an AT&amp;T employee might have, whether that's sales, project management, customer service, human resources technician, and so on. That way students can make the connection between the workplace and their education\", says Brad Yates, the academy's director.</p> <p>Bell insists that such insights from the workplace are \"complementary\" to the school system, not in competition. Junior Achievement takes what students are learning in maths, science, technology and other core curriculum subjects, and demonstrates how these tangibly play out in the world of work.</p> <p>The educational benefits to the students are not only clear but calculable, according to Yates. He cites a study by <a href=\"http://weteachscience.org/\" title=\"\">We Teach Science</a>, another online e-mentoring charity with which AT&amp;T partners. For every hour of mentoring, students' test results were shown to increase by an average of 1.6%. \"That means we'll take someone who has a low likelihood of success, and place them in a position to be successful in high school,\" Yates says.</p> <p>Companies stand to benefit too. Many employees state that volunteering in their communities gives a sense of satisfaction. In harsh commercial terms, that feeds into better retention levels and higher morale. For firms that recruit from nearby schools and universities, any step to increases the capacity of the local talent pool makes bottom-line sense.</p> <h2>Global movement</h2> <p>Junior Achievement isn't just a US phenomenon. The charity now counts links in 120 countries, extending the total reach of its programmes to around 10.5 million young people.</p> <p>In the UK, it trades under the name of <a href=\"http://www.young-enterprise.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Young Enterprise</a>. Financial services firm <a href=\"http://www.capitalone.co.uk/aboutus/csr-community.jsf\" title=\"\">Capital One</a> is among its major corporate supporters. For the last three years, employees from the company's main office in Nottingham have been running sessions in financial literacy in local schools.</p> <p>Advice about money management, debt and personal finance in general often gets overlooked in the classroom due to more pressing social concerns, says the company's head of corporate responsibility Alison Gardner. Teachers themselves aren't necessarily that clued up on the subject either. In contrast, Capital One's employees live and breathe this stuff. \"They are using it every day at work, so why not in the schools too?\" Gardner states.</p> <p>Gardner admits that there might be \"a degree of cynicism\" about a company's motive for going into a school or about their ability to deliver. That's where the charity's heritage and brand comes in. \"By partnering with Youth Enterprise, which is unbiased, has a great reputation and strong links with local schools, it really helps us to engage with students in a different way.\"</p> <p><em>Oliver Balch is author of </em><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780571259250\" title=\"\"><em>India Rising: Tales from a Changing Nation</em></a><em>, published by Faber</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>David Cameron used a major speech this week to take a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/oct/21/david-cameron-law-and-order\">tougher stance on crime and punishment</a>. He focused on the need for \"retribution\" against offenders as part of the justice process. Talking tough on crime is a well-worn tactic in politics, especially for parties ailing in the opinion polls. The Conservatives still trail Labour<a href=\"http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/category/populus\"> in recent polls</a>. </p> <p>But the improving economy may help narrow that gap. Figures released this week show the UK has emerged from recession.

  "<p>There was something bizarre, sad and deeply unsettling about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/24/donald-trump-october-surprise-video\" title=\"\">Donald Trump's much-hyped \"bombshell\" announcement on the US presidential election</a>. Rather like a James Bond villain addressing the world from his lair, the billionaire spoke to camera via the internet to \"reveal\" that he would offer $5m to sick children if President Obama produced his college records. The only thing missing was a bomb and a timer.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the stunt had the desired effect that Trump stunts always do \u2013 lulling people into thinking that, love him or loathe him, Donald Trump is, first and foremost, a celebrity, a television star, and an entertainer. An outlandish buffoon with some of the most ridiculed hair in the world, but essentially harmless.</p> <p>However, there is another side to Trump, as the 1&#xa0;million viewers who watched my film, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b01nln7g/Youve_Been_Trumped/\" title=\"\">You've Been Trumped</a>, on BBC2 this week can attest. And this Trump is not harmless.</p> <p>Trump's first career is as a property developer, and his foray into Scotland to build a golf course has resulted in the needless destruction of a <a href=\"http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/sssi/index.cfm\" title=\"\">site of special scientific interest</a>. It led to the arrest and imprisonment of myself and a colleague. Meanwhile, life has been made a misery for local residents whose only crime was wanting to live in their homes in harmony with the environment. And there is widespread fear Grampian police have been acting as Trump's private security force.</p> <p>But from the thousands of tweets and emails we have received this week following the broadcast, what really gets viewers' ire up is not so much what Trump did, and even how he behaved, but how he was able to get away with it. And this is a story that has not yet run its course.</p> <p>Trump is a businessman out to get the best deal he can. He uses his celebrity to open doors closed to others. But it is the job of our political leaders to protect the public interest.</p> <p>Trump certainly got his way when he convinced the Scottish government <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/nov/03/scotland-donaldtrump\" title=\"\">to ignore years of careful environmental planning</a> and give him permission to build a luxury resort on what one scientist called \"the crown jewels of Scotland's natural heritage\".</p> <p>But perhaps more troubling is the blind eye Alex Salmond (the development is in Salmond's own constituency) and the Scottish government have turned since. When in July 2010 <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5636082/filming-donald-trumps-scottish-golf-course-will-get-you-arrested\" title=\"\">my colleague Richard Phinney and I were arrested</a> and put in an Aberdeen jail cell and charged with \"breach of the peace\" for interviewing Trump's greenkeeper, the National Union of Journalists called it an \"unprecedented\" infringement of press freedom. It was also a reflection of the kind of intimidation felt by local residents, who believed the police were firmly on Trump's side in the many disputes that arose during construction.</p> <p>We put these concerns and others to Salmond \u2013 and the cabinet secretary, John Swinney \u2013 more than two years ago. But our requests for an interview were turned down. Salmond and his ministers also passed up two opportunities to see You've Been Trumped at the Scottish parliament in Edinburgh and at dozens of cinema screenings up and down the country.</p> <p>But only now, following the public furore sparked by the film's BBC broadcast, has Salmond broken his silence, admitting the film raises deep concerns among people who have seen it. He has written to Grampian police's chief constable for an explanation.</p> <p>Why has it taken more than two years to do so? The only logical answer is that Salmond and his government have been hoping that, in their silence, the truth would not be revealed. To the residents who have had to deal with the Bond villain Trump and his cronies, Salmond's response \u2013 or the lack of one \u2013 is deeply insulting and they are right to call it a cover-up.</p> <p>And to the many people who have been shocked, dazed and saddened by what they have witnessed on the small screen this week, the implications for Scottish independence could never have been more pressing.</p>",

I don't know what you do about that. It's easier to deny.\"</p> <p>Asked what was needed to wake people up, the veteran broadcaster famous for series such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Life_Collection\" title=\"\">Life</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mywy\" title=\"\">Planet Earth</a> said: \"Disaster. It's a terrible thing to say, isn't it? Even disaster doesn't do it. There have been disasters in North America, with hurricanes and floods, yet still people deny and say 'oh, it has nothing to do with climate change.' It visibly has got [something] to do with climate change.\"</p> <p>But some US politicians found it easier to deny the science on climate change than take action, he said, because the consequence of recognising the science on man-made climate change \"means a huge section from the national budget will be spent in order to deal with it, plenty of politicians will be happy to say 'don't worry about that, we're not going to increase your taxes.'\"</p> <p>Neither Barack Obama or Mitt Romney mentioned climate change in three TV debates, despite a summer of record temperatures and historic drought in the US.</p> <p>Romney used Obama's commitment to taking action on climate change <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/31/mitt-romney-acceptance-speech-hope\" title=\"\">as a joke in his convention speech</a>. The president later <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/07/barack-obama-mitt-romney-climate\" title=\"\">hit back by saying</a> \"and yes, my plan will continue to reduce the carbon pollution that is heating our planet because climate change is not a hoax. More droughts and floods and wildfires are not a joke.\" However, environmentalists have been critical of Obama's silence on the subject and the Green party presidential candidate, Jill Stein, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/22/us-elections-barack-obama-climate-denial\" title=\"\">went as far as saying</a> it meant he was, in effect, \"another climate denier\".</p> <p>Attenborough said he thought the US's attitude towards climate change and the environment was not just because of politics, but because of the country's history. \"[It's] because they're a pioneer country. There has been the wild west, the western frontier\u2026 that's still there, you see it in the arms business, the right for everyone to bear arms. It's part of the pioneer stuff that you've [Americans] grown up with.\"</p> <p>By contrast, he said, people in the UK had \"grown up with a mythology of black industry and wrecking the countryside.\"</p> <p>The current financial crisis has made it problematic for politicians to show leadership on climate change, Attenborough acknowledged. \"Well it's a very difficult time to do it [show leadership]. In times of recession, it's a very difficult time to advance these arguments [on the urgency of tackling climate change] that mean you have to spend even more money and take money from taxes to do things,\" he said.</p> <p>Yet he also warned that it was becoming clear the impacts of climate change were worst than had been expected. Talking about the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/19/arctic-ice-shrinks\" title=\"\">record Arctic sea ice melt this summer</a>, he said: \"The situation is worse than we thought [in the Arctic]. The processes of melting are more volatile than we thought. More complicated. The ice cap is really melting faster than we thought.\"</p> <p>The 86-year-old naturalist, who is also a patron of the charity <a href=\"http://www.populationmatters.org/\" title=\"\">Population Matters</a>, said many of the environmental problems the world faced could be helped by addressing human population, which is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/oct/31/seven-billionth-baby-born-philippines\" title=\"\">believed to have reached the 7 billion mark last year</a>, and is forecast to reach 10 billion by the middle of the century.</p> <p>The solution, he said, was to raise living standards and increase democracy in developing countries. \"The only way I can think of it [tackling population] is by giving women the rights to control their own bodies and control how many children they have. In every circumstance where women have that right, where they have the vote, where they are proper medical facilities, where they are literate, where they are given the choice, the birth rate falls,\" he said. \"That is a good start, if that could be spread.\"</p> <p>\u2022 You can read more of Sir David Attenborough's views on climate change and animals in this Sunday's Observer magazine</p>",

But it appears the spat may have been going on for longer than many suspected, with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/oct/25/obama-tonight-show-jay-leno-video\">Obama jokingly suggesting it began in childhood</a> \u2013 when they were both growing up in Kenya.</p> <p>The cheeky remark appeared to have scored the president a direct hit against the billionaire real estate mogul, who has championed the \"birther\" movement that falsely claims Obama was born in Kenya and so cannot be president. On the Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Obama joked that the two men had a long-running dispute. \"This all dates back to when we were growing up in Kenya. We had constant run-ins on the soccer field, he wasn't very good and resented it. When we finally moved to America, I thought it would be over.\"</p> <p>On Monday Trump promised a \"gigantic\" announcement about Obama that could change the course of the presidential race. Critics were underwhelmed when the announcement finally came in a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/24/donald-trump-october-surprise-video\" title=\"\">web video</a> on Wednesday: an offer to donate $5m to a charity of the president's choosing in return for the release of his college records and passport application.</p> <p>Trump said: \"I have a deal for the president, a deal that I don't believe he can refuse, and I hope he doesn't. If Barack Obama opens up and gives his college records and applications, and if he gives his passport applications and records, I will give to a charity of his choice \u2013 inner-city kids in Chicago, American Cancer Society, Aids research, anything he wants \u2013 a cheque, immediately, for $5m.\"</p> <p>Critics accused the mogul of pulling another publicity stunt. The comedian <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorowitzReport/status/261147013582831617\" title=\"\">Andy Borowitz</a> tweeted: \"Attention parents: if you give your children even the tiniest bit of attention now, maybe they won't grow up to be Donald Trump.\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jimgeraghty/status/261139700901900289\" title=\"\">Jim Geraghty</a>, of the conservative National Review, posted: \"If at any point you seriously considered Donald Trump for president, please study the error of your ways in quiet, private contemplation.\"</p> <p>Trump defended his actions, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/260850401874681857\" title=\"\">tweeting</a>: \"This is not a media event or about Donald J Trump \u2013 this is about the United States of America.\" He <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/261147459739336705\" title=\"\">added</a>: \"'The response has been fantastic \u2013 actually overwhelming! Thank you!\"</p> <p>Asked about the announcement by Jay Leno, Obama looked unfazed and appeared unlikely to rise to the bait. Instead he cracked more jokes. Asked whether there was a cure for \"Romnesia\" \u2013 Obama's word for what he describes as Mitt Romney's selective memory \u2013 he responded: \"Obamacare covers pre-existing conditions.\"</p> <p>The president promised sweets for all trick-or-treaters coming to the gates of the White House, and extra large chocolate bars for anyone from the swing state of Ohio. \"It is an election year, so candy for everybody,\" Obama announced. \"If anybody comes from Ohio to the White House, they will get a Hershey bar about this big,\" he said, holding his hands wide apart.</p>",

The Council of Ministers would therefore need to improvise one according to its own design.</p> <p>Second, an independent Scotland could either be considered a successor state, inheriting the United Kingdom\u2019s rights and status, or a new applicant, but would have no automatic right to the former. A political decision would have to be taken by the Council of Ministers acting unanimously.</p> <p>Third, even if Scotland was granted the status of a successor state, there would still have to be extensive negotiations to disentangle Scotland\u2019s legal and financial obligations from those of the United Kingdom. There would be no certainty that Scotland would get a good deal out of those negotiations given that it would be UK rather than Scottish ministers sitting in the relevant EU decision-making bodies.</p> <p>What emerges from this is that the real determining factors are political rather than legal. The status and rights of an independent Scotland in relation to the EU would be decided by a body comprised of twenty-seven countries (possibly more by the time it happens), any one of which might use its veto to block the process in pursuit of its own national interests and to the detriment of Scotland\u2019s.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.progressonline.org.uk/2012/10/25/real-choices-for-labour/\">\u2022 Progress has launched the Purple Papers, an attempt to start a debate on the hard policy choices that would face a Labour government in 2015.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The election of Helle Thorning-Schmidt\u2019s social democrats in Denmark last October and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande in France this year were notable exceptions.

In France, Hollande has seen the sharpest decline in popularity of any newly elected president in the history of the fifth republic. Hollande\u2019s socialist deputies and their Green allies are in revolt against the president\u2019s request that they approve the European fiscal pact he disingenuously vowed to renegotiate. The Red-Green Alliance, which formed part of the electoral bloc that brought Thorning-Schmidt to power, are up in arms at the prime minister\u2019s tight fiscal policy and centrist welfare reforms.

The first minister said he expected to be cleared of breaching the code, telling Holyrood he had been exonerated in all five of the previous occasions he had been referred under the code since becoming first minister in 2007.

We can see that with unemployment falling, with a quarter of the deficit paid down in the last two years. There is more to do but these figures are good progress.</p> </blockquote> <p>From<strong> Len McCluskey</strong>, the Unite general secretary</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While any growth in the economy is to be welcomed, the picture is clouded by the artificial boost to the economy generated by Olympic ticket sales \u2013 a once-in-a-lifetime occasion - which was responsible for 0.2 per cent of this growth.</p> <p>\u201cToo much of the growth is centred on London and the service sector, a more realistic indicator is that the construction industry is still in the doldrums and its contribution to the last quarter\u2019s GDP figures declined by 2.5 per cent.</p> <p>David Cameron and George Osborne\u2019s austerity polices are still causing serious problems to the economy which remains flat. If you strip away the economic fillip created by the Olympic ticket sales, you have an economy stuck on the starting blocks with anaemic growth, and you still have the food banks on the rise and long-term unemployment on the increase.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>John Cridland</strong>, the CBI director general</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s really encouraging news that growth has snapped back so strongly in the third quarter. Although the Olympics and Jubilee have made up the majority of that growth, these numbers do also seem to point to some acceleration in underlying momentum.</p> <p>We expect conditions to remain positive going into the fourth quarter, reflecting some easing of the pressure on household budgets from lower inflation. But the global economic environment remains challenging.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Jonathan Edwards</strong>, the Plaid Cyrmu Treasury spokesman</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>These figures today showing a return to growth in the past quarter are very welcome but the reality is that the economy has flatlined in the past year and for most people life is harder than before the crash.</p> <p>In Wales, we still have 50,000 more people unemployed than in 2007, showing the need for Leanne Wood\u2019s Plan C programme to create jobs in Wales. A Party of Wales government would be a real boost for Wales.</p> </blockquote> <p>From<strong> Graeme Leach</strong>, chief economist at the Institute of Directors</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The bounce back in GDP growth is good news but not enough to pop the champagne corks. More than half of the quarterly increase is attributable to the Olympics and the reversal of the Jubilee effect in Q2.</p> <p>The key message is that we\u2019re out of recession but uncertain where we\u2019re going. Not for the first time we need to heed the warning that you can\u2019t see the road ahead through the rear view mirror.</p> <p>Our view is that growth will continue in Q4 but we have to recognise there could be a fallback.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Tony Dolphin</strong>, the IPPR's chief economist</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Weak growth for the past two years can be partly accounted for by the combination of high food and energy prices, which have hit consumers hard, exports falling short of expectations due to the euro crisis and a shortage of credit for small businesses which has led to weak business investment. It is also clear that the Government\u2019s austerity plan has held back growth.</p> <p>\u201cThe outlook is still very uncertain, not least due to the prospect of increases in food and energy prices renewing the squeeze on households. The Chancellor should respond in his autumn statement. Spending on infrastructure gives the biggest boost to the economy in the short-term. George Osborne should announce an immediate increase in infrastructure spending of \u00a315 billion over the next two years to kick-start growth.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5089202db5794584b1c13f57\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-25T11:19:10.052Z\">12.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>You can read all today's Guardian politics stories <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/all\">here.</a> And all the politics stories filed yesterday, including some in today's paper, are <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/oct/24/all\">here.</a></p> <p>As for the rest of the papers, here is<a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com/uk/todays_must_reads.html\"> the PoliticsHome list of top 10 must reads,</a> here is <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/frontpage/2012/10/newslinks-for-thursday-25th-october-2012.html\">the ConservativeHome round-up of today's politics stories </a>and here is <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/staggers/2012/10/morning-call-pick-papers-6\">the New Statesman list of top 10 comment articles in today's papers.</a></p> <p>And here are some stories I found particularly interesting.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/1bnayear-black-hole-in-university-funding-revealed-8225465.html\">\u2022 Richard Garner in the Independent says a new report shows the new tuition fee system created by the government could cost more than the system it replaced.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A \u00a31bn-a-year \u201cblack hole\u201d in university funding means the Government\u2019s new \u00a39,000 fees regime is in danger of costing taxpayers more than the old system.</p> <p>A report by the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi), a highly respected think-tank, says the Government has \u201cseriously understated\u201d the cost of its higher education reforms.

I've taken the quotes from <a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com\">PoliticsHome,</a> the BBC and the Press Association.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Duncan Smith said that families living on benefits, and very wealthy families, were more likely to have large numbers of children than families on average incomes.</strong> That was because families on average incomes had to decide how many children they could afford, he said. Families living on benefits should be forced to make the same decisions, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When you look at families across the board in all incomes, you find that the vast majority make decisions about the numbers of children they can have, the families they want, based on what they think they can afford and how it\u2019s going to work. Where you see the clustering of large families is really down at the very lowest incomes \u2013 those on significantly levels of welfare \u2013 and those on the very top incomes. In other words, the problem for those who are paying the taxes, paying the bills - they make the decisions about their lives, even if they would sometimes have extra children, they make decisions. People who are having support through welfare are often free from that decision.</p> </blockquote> <p>Duncan Smith said he wanted to support out-of-work families with children. But he also wanted to make them realise that \"you have to cut your cloth in accordance with what capabilities and what finances you have.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that he was considering capping child-related benefits for families after they have more than two children.</strong> \"My view, if you did this, you would start it for people who begin to have more than, say, two children,\" he said.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the government was right to cap housing benefits because paying more than \u00a3100,000 a year for some families was \"madness\".</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said benefits should be \"temporary\" for most people and that the welfare system should encourage people to find work.</strong> This was what universal credit would do, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Benefits should be for many people \u2013 unless you\u2019re chronically sick \u2013 a temporary place. It\u2019s a place you then move on into work. And we want to help you do that.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the current welfare system \"destroys lives\" because it allows people who should be working to remain on benefits long-term.</strong> That was why the government was reforming the system, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have accepted far too long in this country that it is possible just to stay on benefits, that we write them off, and we work only with those who get up in the morning and go to work. And that\u2019s simply not acceptable. It\u2019s not acceptable because it destroys their lives; it also destroys the lives of taxpayers who have to pick up that bill to pay for them.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50890aeb95cb4897f0db52ea\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-25T09:48:27.841Z\">10.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-98771c64-8a0b-4fdd-857d-5567f1d8217e\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/25/1351158402840/03803a12-ef80-406a-bd60-3a8579f99cb1-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Ed Balls\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor  Photograph: Allstar Picture Library/Alamy</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar Picture Library / Alamy/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Ed Balls</strong>, the shadow chancellor, has now put out a statement about the GDP figures. Here it is in full.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It's good news that, with the help of the Olympics, Britain is finally out of the longest double-dip recession since the Second World War. Our economy desperately needs an injection of confidence. But this is no time for complacency and wishful thinking.</p> <p>Today's figures show that underlying growth remains weak and that our economy is only just back to the same size as a year ago - twelve months of damaging flatlining which has seen borrowing rise in the first half of this year.<br>And with living standards falling, more tax rises on the way, small business lending down and the eurozone still in crisis, it would be very unwise of David Cameron and George Osborne to just sit back, cross their fingers and hope for the best. The complacent thing to do now is simply to wait and hope things will get better. The cautious thing to do is to act now to secure and strengthen growth in our economy.&#xa0;</p> <p>Britain needs a plan to secure and sustain a strong economic recovery, including using funds from the 4G mobile spectrum auction to build 100,000 affordable homes, a temporary VAT cut and a bank bonus tax to fund jobs for young people out of work. We also need action to ease the squeeze for people on low and middle incomes, rather than a tax cut for millionaires. And we need long-term changes to make our economy stronger, including a long-term plan to rebuild our infrastructure and radical reform of the banks.</p> <p>In the two years since the spending review our economy has grown by just 0.6 per cent, compared to the 4.6 per cent George Osborne said his plan would deliver and growth of 3.4 per cent in the USA and 3.3 per cent in Germany. So the question for the coming months is whether and how we can catch up all the ground we have lost over the last two years and not keep falling behind as other countries move ahead.</p> <p>A one-off boost from the Olympics is welcome. But it is no substitute for a plan to secure and sustain the strong recovery that Britain desperately needs if we are to create jobs, get the deficit down and make people better off.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5089064d95cb4897f0db52e4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-25T09:28:45.935Z\">10.28am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In Scotland the SNP government is doing its best to draw a line under the controversy about Alex Salmond misleading voters about non-existent legal advice.

First, today's figures include a bounce of at least 0.5% due to <a href=\"http://www.markit.com/assets/en/docs/commentary/markit-economics/2012/oct/UK_PMI_all_sector_12_10_03.pdf\">lost output</a> from the Jubilee bank holiday and <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/economy/national-accounts/articles/2011-present/impact-of-the-olympics/measuring-the-impact-of-the-olympics-on-the-national-accounts---download.pdf\">sales of Olympic tickets and TV rights</a> all scoring in the third quarter.</p> <p>Second, 80% of the spending cuts are still to come. As the <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2012/02/pdf/c1.pdf\">IMF admitted</a> earlier this month, austerity may have had a bigger impact on growth than previously predicted.

GDP was estimated to have increased by 1.0 per cent in the third quarter of 2012.</p> <p>The largest contribution to the increase came from the services sector. There was also an increase in activity in the production sector. Activity in the construction sector fell. The latest GDP estimate was affected by the changes made to the quarter two Bank Holidays in May and June 2012 as part of the celebrations for the Queens Diamond Jubilee. The end of May bank holiday moved to June and there was an additional day's holiday in June. Over the second quarter, this resulted in one fewer working days. The change to the bank holidays was not a regular event so no adjustment was made to account for it as part of the seasonal adjustment process. This means that any impact of the changes fed directly through to the GDP estimate ...</p> <p>In addition to the impact of the bank holiday changes, the latest GDP estimate was affected by the Olympics and Paralympics events in the third quarter. The Olympics took place from 27 July to 12 August 2012 (with a few events starting on 25 July), and the Paralympics from 29 August to 9 <br>September. The events were likely to have impacted on the economy in a number of ways (note that \u2018Olympic\u2019 or \u2018Olympics\u2019 below refers to both the Olympics and Paralympic events):</p> <p>\u2022 Sports activities, amusement and recreation: tickets for the Olympics were sold in tranches through 2011 and 2012 but, in accordance with national accounts principles, these have been allocated to the third quarter, when the output actually occurred. The impact of the ticket sales <br>on GDP can be clearly seen in the lower level data for sports activities, which is part of the Government and other services aggregate in Table B1. Ticket sales were estimated to have increased GDP in the quarter by about 0.2 percentage points</p> <p>\u2022 Employment activities: employment agencies showed some strength in the quarter and it is possible that some of this strength was related to the Olympics. However, there was no direct evidence from survey respondents to support this</p> <p>\u2022 Creative arts and entertainment activities: the arts and entertainment sector has been showing some strength for some time, with quite strong growth in the most recent quarter. There was some evidence from survey returns that output was higher in July and August because of the Olympics</p> <p>\u2022 Office administration: office administration was quite strong in the quarter but the evidence on any Olympic effect was mixed, with some respondents suggesting that it may have had an adverse effect, as opposed to explaining the strength</p> <p>\u2022 Accommodation: hotels showed greater activity in the quarter and this was one area where one might expect to see an Olympic effect, albeit mainly in London. There was some evidence from survey returns that output was higher in July and August because of the Olympics</p> <p>\u2022 Food and beverage services: there was some strength in the food and drink sector and some evidence from survey returns that part of this might have been due to the Olympics</p> <p>\u2022 Land transport: there was some strength in parts of the transport sector and some evidence from survey returns that this might have been due to the Olympics</p> <p>\u2022 Retail: retail showed some strength in the quarter but there was very little evidence of any significant Olympic effect. Indeed there was some feedback from online retailers that sales were lower as consumers watched the Olympics instead of shopping online</p> <p>\u2022 Motion picture, video and TV programme production: the data here were quite weak for the quarter and there was some evidence from survey respondents to support this weakness - 'people watching the Olympics instead'</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-25T09:29:24.787Z\">at 10.29am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5088f97695cb4897f0db52d5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-25T08:33:58.669Z\">9.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/gva/gross-domestic-product--preliminary-estimate/q3-2012/index.html\">Here is the Office for National Statistics news release about the GDP figures.</a></p> <p>And here is <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_284925.pdf\">the ONS statistical bulletin with the full details (pdf).</a></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-25T08:34:38.459Z\">at 9.34am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5088f8ae95cb4897f0db52d3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-25T08:30:38.973Z\">9.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>\u2022 Growth was up by 1% in Q3, the ONS says.</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-25T08:31:03.627Z\">at 9.31am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5088f78eb5794584b1c13f2a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-25T08:25:50.246Z\">9.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-8135554b-a8f9-474d-a431-a250aecc2cd6\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/25/1351153331500/816a87bc-1412-4ac9-bff5-dfea368189bc-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Sir William Beveridge\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir William Beveridge.

At 9.30am we are expected to hear that Britain is out of recession. It\u2019s not really a \u201ccrack-open-the-champagne\u201d moment; the double-dip was never expected to happen in the first place, and when David Cameron came to power, anyone predicting that Britain would spend the first half of 2012 in recession would have been branded an extreme pessimist. But, for a government desperate for every scrap of good news, it\u2019s a bonus.</p> <p>Here\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/24/cameron-accused-leaking-gdp-figures\">Patrick Wintour\u2019s Guardian splash about the GDP announcement, and the row over whether Cameron \u201cleaked\u201d the figures in advance.</a> And here\u2019s<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/25/gdp-figures-relief-osborne\"> an analysis from Larry Elliott about what we should expect. </a><br>He says a rise in output of less than 0.6 or 0.7% would be a disappointment.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Assuming a 0.5 point bounceback from the depressed activity in the second quarter and 0.1 to 0.2 points from the Olympics, anything less than a 0.6% or 0.7% increase in gross domestic product will be seen by the City as a disappointment. A figure of 1% or higher would exceed expectations and put paid to any prospect of further stimulus from the Bank of England.</p> <p>One thing is certain: the figures \u2013 whether good, bad or indifferent \u2013 will not end the political debate about the state of the economy. Rachel Reeves, Labour\u2019s shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said even if the economy were to grow by 1% in the third quarter, it would only take the level of activity back to where it was a year ago. \u201cThe question is what the underlying growth rate of the economy is when we strip out the one-off Olympics and bank holiday effects,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat really matters for jobs, living standards and the deficit is whether there is a strong and sustained recovery and whether and how we can catch up all the ground we have lost over the last two years.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>And <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/25/eurozone-crisis-live-britain-emerges-from-recession\">here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s business live blog, which will be taking the lead in covering the figures.</a> Here I will be focusing on the political reaction.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the full agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>9.30am:</em> The GDP figures for the third quarter of 2012 (Q3, in the jargon). They are widely expected to show that they recession is over.</p> <p><em>10.15am:</em> Martin Wheatley, head of the consumer and markets business unit at the Financial Services Authority, gives evidence to the parliamentary commission on banking standards.</p> <p><em>12pm:</em> Ed Miliband and Yvette Cooper launch Labour police and crime commissioners election campaign in Preston, Lancashire.</p> <p><em>Around 12pm:</em> MPs begin a backbench debate on a motion tabled by the Green MP Caroline Lucas saying the government should abandon the badger cull planned for next year. We may be covering the debate on a separate live blog.</p> <p><em>1pm:</em> David Cameron holds talks with Herman van Rompuy, president of the European Council.</p> <p><em>2.40pm:</em> Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, gives a speech at the national children and adult services conference. He is expected to make an announcement on dementia friendly environments.</p> <p>Later Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary, is giving a speech on welfare. The speech is at 6pm, and so it will be out of my time, but some extracts have been released in advance and Duncan Smith was on the Today programme talking about it earlier, and I will cover what he had to say soon.</p> <p>As usual, I'll also be covering all the breaking political news as well as looking at the papers and bringing you the best politics from the web.

  "<p>While Donald Trump had no problem <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/richard-adams-blog/2012/oct/24/romney-obama-october-surprise-politics-live#block-508817fe95cb4897f0db5281\">demanding that Barack Obama reveal details about his passport and time at college </a>on Wednesday, the billionaire business mogul proved rather less forthcoming when it came to a request for information about himself.</p> <p>Trump announced on Wednesday that he would donate $5m to a charity of Obama's choosing, if the president handed over his \"college records and applications, and passport application and records\".</p> <p>But when <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/adamgabbatt/donald-trump-and-the-guardians\">the Guardian contacted Trump's office</a> to ask for Trump's college and passport records, it was accused of \"trying to be funny\" and the request was deemed to be \"stupid\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F64660273%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-pzdR6&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;secret_url=true\"> <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F64660273%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-pzdR6&show_artwork=true&secret_url=true\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\"I tell you what, he'll provide them to you when you provide yours to him,\" said Michael Cohen, executive vice president at the Trump Organization and special counsel to Trump, in what began as a friendly encounter.</p> <p>I readily agreed to the deal, and offered to provide my college records and passport-application records to the Trump office for inspection. That seemed to prompt a change of heart.</p> <p>\"But what's your point? Mr Trump's not the president of the United States and he's not running for the presidency,\" Cohen said. \"And pretty much all you need to do is go to one of the thousand different books that Mr Trump has been featured in or has written and so on, and you could learn more about him than you know about pretty much anybody on the planet.\"</p> <p>Trump has authored and co-authored at least 18 books, including: Trump: The Art of the Deal; Trump: How to Get Rich; and Trump: Surviving at the Top. Unfortunately, none of Trump's oeuvre graces the bookshelves at the Guardian's New York office \u2013 an oversight which is in the process of being rectified.</p> <p>Cohen went on to accuse the Guardian of not taking the story seriously. (Nothing, of course, could be further from the truth.)</p> <p>\"I think what you're doing is you're, whether you're trying to be funny, intentionally or not, actually it's a stupid request on your behalf,\" he said. \"It's trying to poke fun at the fact that the president of the United States is the least transparent president that we've ever had. He may be the least transparent politician we've ever come across.</p> <p>\"And I tell you what, why don't you do this, since you want to be so clever. Why don't you turn around and say if Mr Trump releases all of his records to you, you will donate $5m to the charity of his choice?\"</p> <p>I pointed out that I did not have $5m to hand. \"I'm afraid that you shouldn't be asking the same request then,\" Cohen said.</p> <p>Your reporter protested that if Trump was demanding that others producer their records, it was only fair that he produced his own. Cohen said: \"Do you not think Mr Trump has been scrutinised his entire life?\"</p> <p>Surely, I countered, Obama, as president of the United States, had also been subject to considerable scrutiny? </p> <p>\"No, actually Mr Trump does not [think that],\" Cohen said. \"I tell you what, since you want our records, do it under the terms Mr Trump has. Make a donation to Mr Trump's favourite charity.\" </p> <p>I agreed to a donation, but said that it would probably not amount to $5m.</p> <p>\"OK then, $500,000,\" Cohen said.</p> <p>Not being able to put my hands on even so modest a sum as this, I attempted to steer the conversation back to the original suggestion \u2013 that Trump would turn over his records in exchange for mine, for free. Cohen promised that he would \"take it up with Mr Trump\".</p> <p>\"And by the way, while we're at it, I'd like to have all your authorisations under HIPAA, for all your medical records as well,\" Cohen said.</p> <p>Happy to oblige, I asked for an address. But Cohen hung up. </p> <p>So, sadly, we are probably not going to get Donald Trump's college records and passport-application details. Unless someone has a spare $5m lying around...</p>"
