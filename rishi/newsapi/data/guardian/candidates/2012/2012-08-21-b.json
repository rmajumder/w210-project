  "<p>The Republican congressman at the centre of a row over remarks he made about rape has once again insisted that he will not quit the Missouri Senate race and described the pressure on him to quit as \"an overreaction\".</p> <p>Todd Akin said he would be ignoring a state election deadline this evening that would have provided an opportunity to exit easily. </p> <p>He is under huge pressure from the Republican leadership to stand down from the closely fought Missouri race. His decision to press on will be viewed with dismay by senior members of the party.</p> <p>Speaking live on the Mike Huckabee radio show on Tuesday, he said that he was receiving a large amount of support from small, grassroots supporters, including donations, and this helped counter-balance withdrawal of support from Republican leaders. \"I just misspoke one word in one sentence on one day,\" Akin said.</p> <p>An unusual coalition of senior and grassroots Republicans has been making a concerted effort to get him to quit.</p> <p>Tea Party groups, some of which helped Akin secure victory in the primary last week, urged him to go. There were similar calls Monday by presidential challenger Mitt Romney and his running mate Paul Ryan, congressional leaders and conservative talk show hosts. </p> <p>Under state election law, Akin would face no financial penalties if he pulls out by 6pm ET on Tuesday, and the party would be free to pick an alternative. If he goes beyond that time, the next date for withdrawal would be 25 September, but that would require a court order to allow him leave the race. </p> <p>Leaving it until September could also mean he would face significant financial penalties, such as reimbursing the cost of reprinting ballot papers or other election material.</p> <p>But the Republicans' difficulties on abortion are unlikely to go away even if Akin does quit. On Tuesday, as the leadership turned up the heat on Akin, the party approved language in its platform calling for a constitutional amendment banning abortion with no explicit exemptions in cases of rape and incest.</p> <p>Meanwhile, another Republican congressman, Steve King of Iowa, inflamed the row, defending Akin and suggesting that he'd never heard of a woman getting pregnant from statutory rape or incest. </p> <p><a href=\"http://2012.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/08/steve-king-statutory-rape.php\">Talking Points Memo</a> on Monday reported that King told Iowa radio station KMEG-TV reported him saying: \"Well I just haven't heard of that being a circumstance that's been brought to me in any personal way and I'd be open to discussion about that subject matter.\" </p> <p>The controversy has also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/20/paul-ryan-pro-life-akin\">focused attention on the anti-abortion views</a> of Mitt Romney's running mate, Paul Ryan. </p> <p>The Missouri seat held by Democrat Claire McCaskill is regarded by Republicans as the top target in the campaign to take control of the Senate. McCaskill, who has used the row to portray Akin as an extremist, is urging him to stay in the race. </p> <p>The Republican Senate campaign committee and conservative Super Pacs have withdrawn about $10m in financial support for Akin. The last remaining hope for Akin is to attract donations from individual donors. </p> <p>If Akin quits, he could be replaced either by Jim Brunner, a businessman who came second in the primary with 30% \u2013 6% behind Akin \u2013 or Sarah Steelman, a former state treasurer, who took 29%. Brunner has already been sounding out party members about replacing Akin.</p> <p>Public Policy Polling, in a survey conducted on Monday night, showed the row has not had any significant impact on voting intentions yet. Akin is leading McCaskill 44% to 43%, almost unchanged from May when he was ahead 45% to 44%.</p> <p>It may be that the poll was conducted too soon to fully register any unease with Akin.</p> <p>As well as possible repercussions for the Senate race, Democrats also see Akin as useful in highlighting differences between the Obama-Biden ticket and the Romney-Ryan ticket on abortion. </p> <p>In the light of the row, there will be pressure to change the draft to include exceptions for rape and incest.</p>",
  "<p>The Republican party, which has supported a constitutional ban on abortion since 1984, has once again officially endorsed such a ban without exceptions for rape, incest or a threat to the mother's life, according to reports.</p> <p>If adopted by the party next Monday at a vote in Tampa, the official anti-abortion position will be more conservative than that held by its presidential candidate, Mitt Romney.</p> <p>The language was approved by the Republican platform committee on Tuesday morning, <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/21/g-o-p-approves-strict-anti-abortion-language-in-party-platform/?smid=tw-thecaucus&amp;seid=auto\">according to the New York Times</a>.</p> <p>Pro-choice Republicans expressed disappointment and said that the document does not reflect the beliefs of the majority of the party but a more extreme view of the right.</p> <p>The news come amid a fierce and continuing row over a Republican Senate candidate's suggestion on Sunday that victims of \"legitimate rape\" are unlikely to get pregnant. Romney's campaign spokeswoman has said that a Romney-Paul Ryan administration would not oppose abortion in instances of rape and that neither candidate agrees with Todd Akin's comments.</p> <p>The draft document is similar to platforms adopted in 2008, 2004 and 2000, <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/08/20/first-on-cnn-gop-prepares-tough-anti-abortion-platform/\">according to CNN</a>, which first reported the draft language. It states: \"Faithful to the 'self-evident' truths enshrined in the Declaration of Independence, we assert the sanctity of human life and affirm that the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed,\" the draft platform declares. \"We support a human life amendment to the Constitution and endorse legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to unborn children.\"</p> <p>The \"human life amendment\" is still to be approved by delegates to the Republican National Convention next week.</p> <p>Kelly Ferguson, executive chair of the Republican Majority for Choice, expressed disappointment with the language of the anti-abortion plank and with the platform committee, which she said had become more socially conservative. She said: \"The majority of Republicans and Americans do not support an all-out ban on abortion. The party has also chosen a presidential candidate who came out and said he did not support an all out ban with no exceptions.</p> <p>\"There has been a discussion from the top of the party to distance themselves from Todd Akin's statements on rape. We are calling for them to distance themselves from the policy.\"</p> <p>The RNC position is that the platform should be welcoming of different views on different social issues, but at the \"very least there should be exemptions for rape, incest and to save the life of a mother\".</p> <p>Some pro-choice Republicans say the current draft of the abortion plank in the platform, although bad, is less extreme than in previous years.</p> <p>Ann Stone, of Republicans for Choice, said: \"It is bad, but it is not as bad as in the past. We have made some minute progress. It doesn't have exemptions and it doesn't not have exemptions. In 1992, there was an explicit reference to having no exemptions. The language is very vague and less inflammatory. The only other thing that is mildly positive is that they did not come out and embrace personhood.\"</p> <p>The gulf between the Republican party's position on abortion and that of its presidential nominee is not new.</p> <p>In 2008, the party adopted a similar plank on abortion, despite senator John McCain, its nominee, having urged the party in the past to make exceptions. </p> <p>Former president George W Bush also supported exemptions for abortion in cases of rape incest and when a woman's life was in danger.</p>",
  "<p>An unusual coalition of senior and grassroots Republicans is making a concerted push to force rape-row candidate Todd Akin to quit the Missouri senate race ahead of a state election deadline on Tuesday evening.</p> <p>But Akin is stubbornly refusing to go and aired a 30-second ad on Monday night apologising for his comment that \"legitimate rape\" rarely leads to pregnancy.</p> <p>Further evidence that Akin is determined to defy the pressure came from Buzzfeed editor in chief Ben Smith <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BuzzFeedBen/statuses/237929985439051776\">who reported in a tweet</a> that the six-term Republican congressman had also bought up advertising time later this month.</p> <p>Tea Party groups, some of whom helped Akin secure victory in last week, urged him to quit on Tuesday following similar calls Monday by presidential challenger Mitt Romney and his vice-presidential running mate Paul Ryan, Congressional leaders and conservative talk show hosts. </p> <p>Under state election law, Akin would face no financial penalties if he pulls out by 6pm ET tonight, and the party would be free to pick an alternative. </p> <p>If he goes beyond that time, the next date for withdrawal would be September 25, but that would require a court order to allow him leave the race. </p> <p>Leaving it to September 25 could also mean he would face significant financial penalties, such as reimbursing the cost of reprinting ballot papers or other election material.</p> <p>But the Republicans' difficulties on abortion are unlikely to go away even if Akin does quit.

Part of the reason for the existence of the Tea Party movement was a backlash against the party leadership in Washington.</p> <p>If Akin quits, he could be replaced either by Jim Brunner, a businessman who came second in the primary with 30% \u2013 6% behind Akin \u2013 or Sarah Steelman, a former state treasurer, who took 29%. </p> <p>Brunner has already been sounding out party members about replacing Akin.</p> <p>The Republican senate campaign committee and conservative Super Pacs have withdrawn about $10m in financial support for Akin.

  "<p>France's new Socialist government is to hold emergency talks on the plight of the country's Roma after a wave of evictions of makeshift camps prompted accusations that Fran\u00e7ois Hollande was following Nicolas Sarkozy's lead in persecuting the ethnic minority.</p> <p>Human rights groups expressed outrage at a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/09/french-police-roma-camp-repatriations\" title=\"\">recent dawn raids and forced evacuations of caravan sites</a> and squats across France. The police raids left hundreds of Roma, including many children, homeless after caravans were impounded and no arrangements for temporary housing were made. Others were persuaded to board flights home to Romania, activists in Lyon reported.</p> <p>The raids have reopened a bitter row over Roma in France. In 2010, Sarkozy prompted criticism from the European Commission and the Vatican when he linked immigration to crime and promised to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/13/sarkozy-roma-expulsion-human-rights\" title=\"\">expel Roma migrants</a> and destroy illegal camps. More than 70% of illegal Roma encampments were bulldozed and families were offered a financial incentive to leave the country. Sarkozy's government was accused of discrimination in expelling Roma Gypsies to Bulgaria and Romania. Critics alluded to uncomfortable memories of deportations during the second world war. Many of the Roma simply returned to France, but, with old camps destroyed, they ended up living in deeper poverty and worse conditions than ever, amid a climate of fear and intimidation towards them.</p> <p>Hollande had promised during his election campaign that any dismantling of camps would be coupled with the promise of \"alternative solutions\". But this has not happened with the recent evictions.</p> <p>Behind a railway siding in Hellemmes, northern Lille, five extended Roma families and their children huddled under tarpaulins on a patch of land near an abandoned building. Flies circled piles of waste, mothers complained of rats and the stench of human excrement rose from a hole in the ground as well as faeces on grass near the edge of the camp.</p> <p>\"We were evicted from our camp two weeks ago, police knocked on my caravan door one morning and told me to leave,\" said Anita Proda, 27, whose five-year-old son was born in France had been due to start school in September. \"They took my caravan, I grabbed a bag of belongings, but had to leave most behind. We've got no water here, we can't wash the children.\"</p> <p>Most of the evicted Roma had put a few possessions in shopping trolleys and traipsed to this spot where a makeshift camp of six caravans already existed. They are now living in cramped, donated tents surrounded by rubbish and a burned-out car. Local volunteers had been bringing jerry-cans of water .</p> <p>\"These people are being hunted,\" said Yann Lafolie of Atelier Solidaire, which had run literacy and education projects and built wooden cabins in the long-standing camp which police dismantled earlier this month. \"Our voluntary work used to be about integration, now we're trying to handle a humanitarian crisis. This Socialist president was elected for change but there is no change here.\"</p> <p>In the centre of Lille a further 16 evicted families were sheltering temporarily in tents beside a church, where a local priest had said that suddenly seeing boys on bikes carrying jerry-cans of water was like \"being in Burkina Faso\".</p> <p>Outside Lille, in Roubaix \u2013 known as the poorest town in France \u2013 Roma at a makeshift camp in what was once a supermarket car park were nervous, fearing they would soon be evicted too. Families, including a 23-year-old mother of four suffering from cancer, lived in decrepit caravans which leaked in winter, without electricity or proper water supply, although the authorities offer rubblish collection and portable toilets.</p> <p>\"There's a growing anger, a feeling of powerlessness: you can't force people out and leave them without the least sanitary conditions,\" said Bernadette Defais, a local nursing assistant, and volunteer for a local charity La Solidarite.</p> <p>On a street nearby, Ramona Ripa, 22, a Roma mother of four from Romania, showed off her spotlessly scrubbed kitchen in a once abandoned terraced house. She and others now await a court ruling on whether they would be evicted from empty houses owned by the local authority which they had squatted for months, with the help of the French charity and activists group, Droit au Logement (Right to Housing). \"We just want to settle in one place; put our children in school and work,\" Ripa said.</p> <p>Philippe Deltombe, from Droit au Logement, said: \"By evicting these people, the government is not addressing the Roma issue, it's just shifting it on to the next location.\"</p> <p>Images of the dismantled camps and comparisons to Sarkozy's Roma-crackdown have been a PR disaster for Hollande. Measures under consideration in Wednesday's emergency government talks include the possible lifting of working restrictions for Bulgarian and Romanian nationals in an effort to provide legal status for around 15,000 Roma from those two EU countries currently living in France.</p> <p>Manuel Valls, the Socialist party's tough-talking interior minister, said his government's approach to the Roma question had \"nothing in common\" with the Sarkozy era, arguing that \"unsanitary camps\" were \"unacceptable\" and \"a challenge to community life\" in poor neighbourhoods. Officials said police had just been honouring orders made by the courts. But there has been friction within government after the Green party housing minister, Cecile Duflot, said \"dismantling Roma camps without solutions is putting people in an even more precarious situation\".</p> <p>A recent poll showed 80% approved of dismantling the illegal camps, but 73% thought it was not an effective measure as it merely \"displaced\" the problem.</p>",
  "<p>Ethiopia's prime minister, Meles Zenawi, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/21/ethiopia-meles-zenawi-dies-illneses?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">has died aged 57</a>. A commanding and compelling figure, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/08/meles-zenawi-profile-ethiopia-prime-minister\" title=\"\">he tended to polarise opinion</a>. Former US president Bill Clinton cast him as a \"renaissance leader\", but others regarded him as despotic and dictatorial. However he was perceived, though, Meles was hard to ignore. Here are some key dates and political events in his life:</p> <h2>May 1955</h2> <p>Born Legesse Zenawi in the Tigray region of Ethiopia. He would later change his name to Meles, in tribute to an activist killed by Ethiopia's communist government.</p> <h2>1974</h2> <p>Dropped out of medical school and travelled back to the Tigray bush to take part in a nationalist revolt against the dictatorship of Colonel Mengistu Haile Mariam. A year later, he helped found the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front (TPLF).</p> <h2>1989</h2> <p>Became leader of the TPLF, broadening its ethnic Tigrayan power base by setting up the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), a coalition incorporating other ethnic groups.</p> <h2>May 1991</h2> <p>After Mengistu had fled Ethiopia en route to Zimbabwe, Meles and his EPRDF rebels arrived in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. Two months later, an interim government was formed with Meles as transitional president.</p> <h2>August 1995</h2> <p>After poorly contested elections, the EPRDF swept to power; the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia was proclaimed, and Meles became Ethiopia's first prime minister.</p> <h2>1998-2000</h2> <p>Border tensions between Ethiopia and Eritrea, which ceded from Ethiopia in 1993, resulted in a war that claimed tens of thousands of lives before <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/may/25/ethiopia?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">Ethiopia declared victory in May 2000</a>. Seven months later, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/dec/13/ethiopia\" title=\"\">the two countries signed a peace treaty</a>.</p> <h2>May 2005</h2> <p>Ethiopians voted in a poll billed as the country's first democratic election. The opposition Coalition for Unity and Democracy (CUD) gained huge support in cities and towns, but the election culminated in violence in Addis Ababa when the CUD claimed the EPRDF fixed the outcome. A total of 193 protesters and seven policemen were killed, and lingering post-election violence damaged Ethiopia's reputation as an emerging African democracy, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/dec/04/ethiopia\" title=\"\">raising the possibility of foreign aid being withdrawn</a>. Meles <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/aug/30/hearafrica05.eu?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">condemned an EU report criticising the conduct of the election</a> as a \"pack of lies\".</p> <h2>December 2006</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jul/21/mainsection.international11\" title=\"\">Ethiopia sent troops into Somalia</a> to drive Islamists from power. Analysts claimed Meles's government was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jan/13/alqaida.usa?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">backed by the US</a>. The move underlined the close ties Meles had fostered with the west since ousting Mengistu's regime. Ethiopian troops <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/26/ethiopia-ends-somalia-occupation\" title=\"\">withdrew from Somalia in January 2009</a>.</p> <h2>December 2009</h2> <p>Meles represented Africa at the Copenhagen climate talks, cementing his position as one of the continent's leading statesmen despite opposition claims of autocratic tendencies. In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2009/nov/28/africa-climate-change\" title=\"\">a comment piece for the Guardian</a>, Meles said Africa would be hardest hit by the effects of climate change. He subsequently appealed to the conference for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/16/meles-zenawi-copenhagen-climate-funding\" title=\"\">a finance deal whereby rich countries would fund schemes to help poor states adapt to climate change</a> and embrace clean technology.</p> <h2>May 2010</h2> <p>The EPRDF <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/26/ethiopia-election-result-meles-zenawi\" title=\"\">won a landslide victory in the national election</a>, claiming 499 out of 547 seats. The result meant a fourth term as prime minister for Meles, but human rights groups questioned the poll's validity, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/25/ethiopia-election-irregularities-claim?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">citing reported irregularities</a>. EU and US observers said the vote <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13349400\" title=\"\">failed to meet international standards</a>, while opposition leaders demanded the election be held again.</p> <h2>April 2011</h2> <p>Ethiopia's foreign ministry used a press release to <a href=\"http://www.sudantribune.com/Ethiopia-to-step-up-support-to,38593\" title=\"\">voice support for Eritrean rebel groups fighting to overthrow President Isaias Afewerki</a>. Just over a year later, fears of renewed conflict between the two countries resurfaced when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/16/ethiopian-raid-eritrea-conflict\" title=\"\">Addis Ababa announced it had sent troops into its sworn enemy's territory</a> for the first time in more than a decade. The announcement also marked the first time Ethiopia had admitted to such attacks since the conclusion of the border war.</p> <h2>June 2012</h2> <p>Ethiopia announced plans to keep its troops in Somalia until the Horn of Africa nation ratifies a constitution and its military is able to fend off militant threats. Ethiopian troops had crossed into Somalia in November 2011.</p> <h2>July 2012</h2> <p>Meles's failure to attend the African Union summit in Addis Ababa intensified <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/08/ethiopia-meles-zenawai-not-seen\" title=\"\">speculation about his health; the rumours subsequently gathered increasing momentum</a>.</p> <h2>20 August 2012</h2> <p>Ethiopian state television reported <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/21/meles-zenawi\" title=\"\">the death of Meles</a> following a sudden infection. \"The premier [had] been receiving medical treatment abroad for the past two months and his health was improving, but due to a sudden infection which occurred [on Sunday], he went back to hospital for emergency treatment, and even if a lot of medical attention was given by his doctors, he died yesterday [Monday] at around 23:40,\" said the statement. It was announced that deputy prime minister Hailemariam Desalegn would become acting prime minister.</p> <h2>Legacy</h2> <p>Meles saw his legacy as continuous with the accomplishments of the EPRDF. \"I cannot separate my achievements from what can be considered as the achievements of the ruling party,\" he once said. \"Whatever achievement there might have been, it does not exist independent of that party.\" Under his rule, Ethiopia was widely praised for its economic progress. Education improved and women gained greater rights. But Meles's authoritarianism attracted the frequent censure of human rights groups, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/aug/21/ethiopia-renaissance-meles-zenawi\" title=\"\">such concerns will inevitably temper assessments of his bequest to Ethiopia</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Having swapped Oxford for Harvard some years back, the neo-imperialist (his term) historian Niall Ferguson <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/9061577/Historian-Niall-Ferguson-Why-I-am-quitting-Britain-for-intellectual-America.html\" title=\"\">recently observed</a> that he appreciates the US more than the UK because the \"quality of intellectual life \u2026 is so much higher\". He is now finding out just how much the intellectual life of his chosen country appreciates him.</p> <p>In a forthright cover story for Newsweek magazine entitled <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2012/08/19/niall-ferguson-on-why-barack-obama-needs-to-go.html\" title=\"\">Hit the Road, Barack</a>, Ferguson argues that Obama has broken almost all of his campaign promises of four years ago, and attacks the US president's foreign policy, healthcare reforms and economic and fiscal policy.</p> <p>To say that commentators in the US have criticised the piece would be an understatement. Nor is it Ferguson's political views they object to (the Glasgow-born historian was an adviser to Obama's 2008 Republican rival, John McCain). Rather, and somewhat embarrassingly, they dispute the accuracy of his facts and the logic of his argument.</p> <p>\"We are not talking about ideology or even economic analysis here,\" writes the Nobel prize-winning economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, with whom Ferguson has had several previous run-ins, \"just a plain misrepresentation of the facts.\" Krugman accuses Ferguson of \"unethical commentary\" and \"deliberately misleading readers\", and suggests Newsweek should print an \"abject correction\" of one particularly \"cheap shot\" on healthcare reform.</p> <p>Ferguson has since responded in a <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/08/20/newsweek-cover-rebuttal-paul-krugman-is-wrong.html\" title=\"\">post</a> for the Newsweek-owned Daily Beast website, with typical vim (\"You know you have hit the target when Paul Krugman takes time out from his hiking holiday\"). But Krugman is far from being the only leading US commentator to take issue with his broadside.</p> <p>Among a raft of other \"intellectual fouls\", US commentators accuse Ferguson of blaming Obama for job losses that happened before he even took office; citing unverifiable figures from undisclosed sources; confusing basic economic ratios such as debt-to-GDP and debt-to-revenue; getting both the facts and the economics wrong when referring to US banks' capital adequacy and misrepresenting the budgetary implications of Obamacare.</p> <p>In the Atlantic, James Fallows \u2013 a Harvard alumnus \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/08/as-a-harvard-alum-i-apologize/261308/\" title=\"\">apologises on behalf of his alma mater</a>, saying Ferguson's story \"is so careless and unconvincing that I wonder how he will presume to sit in judgment of the next set of student papers he has to grade\".</p> <p>Describing Ferguson as \"embarrassingly bad\" and accusing him of lying, Brad DeLong, a widely read University of California Berkeley economist, <a href=\"http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2012/08/more-lies-from-niall-ferguson.html\" title=\"\">recommends</a>: \"Fire his ass. Fire his ass from Newsweek, and the Daily Beast. Convene a committee at Harvard to examine whether he has the moral character to teach at a university. There is a limit, somewhere.

  "<p>Westminster will be working itself into a familiar frenzy when David Cameron embarks on his first substantive ministerial reshuffle early next month.</p> <p>Downing Street knows that the excitement of new faces walking to No 10 for their first cabinet meeting will be a complete irrelevance if the government is perceived to have failed in the area that always decides elections: the economy.</p> <p>Labour says the government has done just that: Rachel Reeves, the shadow Treasury chief secretary, describes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/21/uk-public-finances-deficit-borrowing\" title=\"\">the increased government borrowing figures</a> as a \"damning indictment of a chancellor\" who has delivered a double-dip recession leading to \"soaring borrowing\".</p> <p>The Treasury played down the significance of the figures as it blamed a cut in North Sea oil production for most of the fall in corporation tax receipts, necessitating the increased borrowing.</p> <p>But there are deep nerves in Whitehall that George Osborne is reaching the stage where voters will make an irrevocable judgment that he has failed to deliver his two key economic pledges made during the 2010 election. These were to stabilise the public finances and to preside over an economic recovery led by a rejuvenated private sector.</p> <p>In both these areas Osborne is unlikely to be able to claim success by the time of the next election. He has already admitted failure in the first area when he announced in last November's autumn statement that he would not meet his target, set out in his emergency budget of June 2010, to eliminate the structural budget deficit by the time of the next election.</p> <p>The chancellor is also struggling to deliver his second pledge \u2013 an economic recovery spearheaded by the private sector, which was meant to pick up the slack as public spending was cut. The double-dip recession indicates that the public spending cuts may have sucked demand out of the economy at such a pace that private growth has been stifled.</p> <p>A key moment for Osborne will come when he delivers his autumn statement in November. The chancellor has little room for manoeuvre because he played his trump card last year \u2013 reminding voters that his deficit reduction plan is an aspiration and not a fixed target. His fiscal mandate has been dubbed Osborne's \"ever flexible friend\" because the target for assessing the deficit is judged on a rolling five-year basis. This means that a definitive judgment never needs to be made.</p> <p>Osborne may, as he did last year, announce that he is extending the period of spending cuts without breaking his mandate. Had Osborne stood by his initial informal target to eliminate the structural budget deficit by the time of the next election, he would have had to impose punitive spending cuts and tax increases.</p> <p>Unease over the government's economic policy is creating some unlikely bedfellows. Vince Cable and Boris Johnson are the most senior figures in the two coalition parties to raise concerns about the lack of a growth strategy.</p> <p>In a leaked letter in March, Cable warned of an absence of \"a compelling vision of where the country is heading beyond sorting out the fiscal mess\". Johnson recently called on Cameron to stop \"pussyfooting around\" and support a new airport for London, highlighting concerns among many Tories about the failure of the government to acknowledge the significance of large infrastructure projects.</p> <p>Some Liberal Democrats are concerned that Osborne has stumbled because he thought the key economic tool was what he calls active monetary policy. The Lib Dems fully support an active monetary policy because they agree that focusing too much attention on fiscal policy as a way of stimulating the economy through spending is largely to blame for the parlous state of the public finances.</p> <p>But the Lib Dems fear that Osborne may have laid the grounds for the current lack of a growth strategy by believing, initially at least, that monetary policy is the only tool. Lurking in the background is Osborne's belief that low taxes are the best way of creating a vibrant economy.</p> <p>No doubt the debate over tax and spending in the US presidential election may come into play over here. <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/18/to-obama-republican-budget-plans-are-snake-oil/\" title=\"\">President Barack Obama has described the Romney-Ryan proposals for tax cuts as \"snake oil\".</a> The president said: \"They've been trying to sell this trickle-down snake oil before.\"</p>",
  "<p>At an African Union summit meeting in January, Meles Zenawi, the taciturn Ethiopian prime minister, made a <a href=\"http://au.int/en/summit/18thsummit/speeches/remarks-he-ato-meles-zenawi-prime-ministre-federal-democratic-republic-ethiopia-\" title=\"\">terse, punchy speech, expressing his admiration for China</a>.</p> <p>Meles, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/21/ethiopia-meles-zenawi-dies-illneses\" title=\"\">whose death was announced</a> on Tuesday by the Ethiopian government, spoke of China's \"amazing re-emergence\" and its important role in Africa's renaissance. The Ethiopian strongman's lavish praise of China owed much to the occasion \u2013 the inauguration of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/jan/27/constructive-criticism-intra-african-trade\" title=\"\">swanky African Union headquarters donated by Chinese labour and money</a> at a cost of $200m.</p> <p>But his admiration for China, coupled with an attack on \"market fundamentalist\" ideas that he said had wrecked African economies, was heartfelt. Under his long rule \u2013 since the overthrow of Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991, Meles has dominated Ethiopian politics \u2013 Ethiopia has pursued a top-down model of development, much like China.</p> <p>The result has been impressive economic growth. Ethiopia has achieved annual economic growth of more than 7% for the past decade. As a result of rising agricultural output, officials expect economic growth of 11% for the 2011-12 fiscal year that ended in June, although inflation remains stubbornly high, hitting 20% in July.</p> <p>Ethiopia's strong economic record and stability in the volatile Horn of Africa have made it a magnet for donors. Over the past year alone, USAid, the US agency for international development, has given Ethiopia \u2013 considered a key American ally \u2013 $675m in aid, and Britain's Department for International Development (DfID) will spend <a href=\"http://www.dfid.gov.uk/ethiopia\" title=\"\">an average of \u00a3331m a year there until 2015</a>.</p> <p>\"Since it came to power in 1991, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EDRDF) has consolidated a capable government that is demonstrably committed to addressing poverty \u2013 with an impressive record of pro-poor spending, sound financial management and a strong commitment to fight corruption,\" says DfID.</p> <p>Ethiopia, however, remains one of the world's poorest countries, with around 25 million out of a population of 85 million living in extreme poverty. Still, Meles won praise for his leadership. Bill Clinton, the former US president, said Meles was part of a \"new generation\" of African leaders, and he was invited to join Tony Blair's <a href=\"http://www.commissionforafrica.info/\" title=\"\">Commission for Africa</a>.</p> <p>Gordon Brown, the UK's former prime minister, was fulsome in his praise of Meles. \"Ethiopia, one of the poorest countries in the world, made more progress in education, health and economic development under his leadership than at any time in its history, and it is a tragedy for the Ethiopian people that they have lost a committed leader and a champion of children at such a young age,\" he said. \"When I last saw him earlier this year we held meetings about how we would ensure every child would be in school in Ethiopia by 2015. His passion was in abolishing poverty and our hope is that he will inspire a new generation of men and women who will champion the cause of eradicating poverty.\"</p> <p>But although Meles won plaudits for his economic record, the government's intolerance of dissent earned it criticism from human rights groups and the UN, and poses <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/feb/03/ethiopia-human-rights-questions\" title=\"\">awkward questions for aid donors</a>. In July, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18825538\" title=\"\">Eskinder Nega, a prominent journalist and blogger, was sentenced to 18 years in prison</a>, and an opposition activist, Andualem Arage, was given a life sentence for breaking anti-terrorism laws.</p> <p>Other journalists have been charged under the same sweeping anti-terrorism law that was introduced in 2009, prompting Navi Pillay, the UN high commissioner of human rights, to say journalists, human rights defenders and critics were facing a \"climate of intimidation\" in Ethiopia.</p> <p>The Ethiopian government's authoritarianism has puzzled observers, as Meles faced no viable opposition following a disputed parliamentary election in 2005. After violent demonstrations, in which 200 protesters were killed, Ethiopia rounded up almost the entire leadership of an opposition group that won all 23 seats in Addis Ababa and jailed them for life for treason.</p> <p>Since then, the political opposition has been toothless; many of its leading figures have given up and gone abroad. Civil society has effectively been strangled under a 2009 NGO law. The law prohibits human rights organisations in Ethiopia from receiving more than 10% of their funding from foreign sources \u2013 effectively shutting down human rights groups, since they cannot survive without substantial foreign funding.</p> <p>In legislative elections in 2010, Ethiopia's ruling party and its allies won virtually all the parliamentary seats, leaving the opposition with only two, in a result that embarrassed the regime. European observers said the election fell short of international standards.</p> <p>DfID has acknowledged Ethiopia's democratic deficit, even while it disburses large amounts of aid. \"Ethiopia has made some progress toward establishing a functioning democracy, but there is a long way to go,\" said DfID in its <a href=\"http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Documents/publications1/op/ethiopia-2011.pdf\" title=\"\">2011-15 operational plan for Ethiopia</a>. \"The UK government continues to raise concerns about limitations on civil and political rights and the longer term sustainability of Ethiopia's tightly controlled political model.\"</p> <p>Such concerns are likely to be acute after Meles's sudden death. As Dr Adekeye Adebajo, executive director of the Centre for Conflict Resolution in Cape Town, South Africa, recently noted, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/08/meles-zenawi-profile-ethiopia-prime-minister\" title=\"\">Meles dominated domestic politics to the extent that a power vacuum on his departure seems certain</a>. With that in mind, it is unlikely that the succession will be smooth.</p>",
  "<p>In March 2005, when Tony Blair released the <a href=\"http://www.commissionforafrica.info/2005-report\" title=\"Commission for Africa report, downloadable\">Commission for Africa report</a> he had sponsored as prime minister, it seemed he had gathered together a winning team: a popular icon of British society, Bob Geldof; his own rival, Gordon Brown; and the best that Africa could offer by way of leaders who wanted to join Africa to the modern world \u2013 among others, South Africa's finance minister, Trevor Manuel, and Ethiopia's prime minister, Meles Zenawi.</p> <p>Meles, in particular, seemed like a younger counterpart to Nelson Mandela. Then only 50, he had been a rebel leader waging war against communist dictatorship, and was now a democrat leading Africa's oldest independent state forwards to a new age of development and modern political values. However, times change and the image of Meles at his death is a far more contradictory one. He has died aged 57 of undisclosed causes, after hospital treatment.</p> <p>Ethiopia's May 2005 elections saw protests that led to the deaths of almost 200 people with 800 wounded. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/26/ethiopia-election-result-meles-zenawi\" title=\"Guardian report, 26 May 2005\">European Union observers declared the elections to have failed international standards</a>, while the <a href=\"http://www.cartercenter.org/index.html\" title=\"\">Carter Centre</a>, the US-based organisation founded by former president Jimmy Carter, said they were fair notwithstanding irregularities and intimidation. The international community by and large accepted the outcome.</p> <p>Although the 2010 elections were not marred by protests of the same scale, opposition parties saw them as flawed and said the relationship between Meles's party, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), and the army had created a one-party state \u2013 with opposition parties permitted only to give a semblance of democracy in order to court the west.</p> <p>From 2006 to 2009, with US assistance, the Ethiopian army mounted an invasion of neighbouring Somalia with the aim of destroying the Islamic Courts Union (ICU), the ruling Islamic militia. Fighting in Mogadishu was fierce, with many accusations of indiscriminate Ethiopian armoured tactics. But the defeat of the ICU left a space for the even more radical Al-Shabaab group, leaving the US-backed Ethiopian intervention a strategic failure.</p> <p>Meles was in the forefront of supporting the New Partnership for Africa's Development (Nepad), one of the parallel engagements between the west and Africa alongside Blair's Commission for Africa, whereby democracy would be encouraged by African peer review, and helped by western largesse.</p> <p>Meles's most prominent recent international activity was in the environmental field. He took a lead on climate change in the African Union and worked, amid great criticism from fellow African presidents, to bring African policy in line with Europe \u2013 again to be rewarded by fast-track financing from Europe.</p> <p>Zenawi was born in Adwa, Tigray, in northern Ethiopia, the son of an Ethiopian father and Eritrean mother. In his 20s, he rebelled against the Stalinist dictatorship of Mengistu Haile Mariam while a medical student at the then Haile Selassie University, Addis Ababa, and in 1975 joined the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front. He became head of its leadership committee in 1979, and of its executive committee by 1983.</p> <p>In 1991, in alliance with the Eritrean People's Liberation Front, led by Isaias Afewerki, the rebel forces swept aside the armies of Mengistu, and Meles became president of Ethiopia. He also became chair of the EPRDF, and in 1993 agreed to what seemed an amicable agreement for Eritrea to leave Ethiopia as its own independent state. But years of tension and war between the two countries were to follow. The conflict was at its bloodiest from 1998 to 2000, but the settlement of the border dispute has only ever allowed an uneasy peace.</p> <p>Meles drove Ethiopia forward with a huge range of reforms and global links. He himself, throughout the early years, found time to devote himself to study, obtaining an MBA from the Open University in 1995 and an MSc in economics from Rotterdam in 2004 \u2013 both universities sending tutors to Ethiopia to educate not only Meles but a large number of the new ruling elite.</p> <p>At the first general elections of 1995, Meles became prime minister and the EPRDF the dominant political party. He and the party were re-elected every five years subsequently. Under their government, Ethiopia has seen a dramatic lowering of infant mortality and a huge growth in education \u2013 literacy rates rose from 50% in 1997 to 65% in 2002. There has been economic growth of up to 9% per year in most of the years of the new millennium. The country has seen a huge building and housing boom. Meanwhile, controversial land-ownership policies have facilitated the agri-industry.</p> <p>The actual workings of the multi-party system have been controversial, with violence and accusations of fraud marring elections. Meles's foreign policy, while asserting Ethiopia's importance in the region and the world beyond, has had problematic consequences.</p> <p>Despite the controversies surrounding his policies, the positive elements in them were celebrated. Meles won the Norwegian Green Revolution prize, and awards for lifting much of Ethiopia out of poverty and hunger. Under his rule, Ethiopia doubled its food production.</p> <p>Perhaps the iron man who is nevertheless \"modern\", who leaves a genuine developmental legacy while making life hard for his opposition, who seeks to please the west while cementing his country's own regional interests is a necessary step on the path of African growth. Meles was pragmatic when it came to contemplating the world around him and around Africa.</p> <p>The beautiful and grand new headquarters of the African Union, opened in Addis Ababa in 2012, was financed, designed and built by Africa's new friend, China.</p> <p>Meles is survived by his wife, Azeb Mesfin, a son, Senay, and two daughters, Semhal and Marda.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Meles Zenawi, rebel leader and politician, born 8 May 1955; died 20 August 2012</p>",

He was 57.</p> <p>During his 21-year rule, Meles turned Ethiopia into one of Africa's fastest-growing economies and proved to be a key US ally in the war on terror. But he was also regarded as an authoritarian strongman whose critics suffered persecution, imprisonment and torture.</p> <p>Meles had not been seen in public for about two months. He failed to attend a meeting of African Union heads of state in the capital, Addis Ababa, last month, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/08/ethiopia-meles-zenawai-not-seen\" title=\"\">raising speculation about his health</a>.He died \"abroad\" at around 11.40pm on Monday after contracting an infection, state television said on Tuesday.</p> <p>His demise creates a potential power vacuum in Addis Ababa. Expressing concern, Kenya's prime minister, Raila Odinga, told the BBC World Service: \"We need a seamless, peaceful, transition of power. The region, the horn of Africa, needs stability.\"</p> <p>Hailemariam Desalegn, appointed deputy prime minister and foreign affairs minister in 2010, will be sworn in as prime minister after an emergency meeting of parliament, said Bereket Simon, the communications minister.</p> <p>\"To be sick is human and he has been struggling to be healthy in the last year,\" Simon told reporters in Addis Ababa. Meles's family were by his side when he died, he said. \"He has been diligently delivering on his promises; illness has never been a hindrance.\"</p> <p>Simon added: \"I assure you everything is stable and everything will continue as charted by the prime minister.\"</p> <p>On Tuesday, state TV showed pictures of Meles against a soundtrack of classical music. Simon called the death shocking and devastating.</p> <p>Born on 8 May 1955, Meles grew up in the northern town of Adwa, where his father had 13 siblings from various women. He moved to the capital on a scholarship after completing an eight-year elementary education in just five years.</p> <p>A hardline Marxist-Leninist and a towering intellect, Meles became president in 1991 after helping to oust Mengistu Haile Mariam's Communist military junta, which was responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths. He became prime minister in 1995, head of the federal government and armed forces.</p> <p>Meles introduced a controversial form of ethnic nationalism and, from 1998-2000, went to war with neighbouring Eritrea, a conflict that resulted in tens of thousands of deaths. The countries remain sworn enemies. Eritrea will be watching developments closely.</p> <p>The US has long viewed Meles as a strong security partner and has given hundreds of millions of dollars in aid over the years. US military drones that patrol east Africa, especially over Somalia, are stationed in Ethiopia.</p> <p>Ethiopia has long been criticised by human rights groups for the government's hardline crackdowns on dissent. During the G8 summit in Chicago last May, Meles was interrupted soon after he started to speak: \"You are a dictator! You have committed crimes against humanity!\" a member of the audience shouted.</p> <p>The bald, bespectacled politician, visibly shocked at first, tried to continue talking before staring down, stony-faced.</p> <p>Leslie Lefkow, deputy director of Human Rights Watch in Africa, said Meles brought Ethiopia out of a hugely difficult period following Mengistu's rule and made important economic progress, but the ruling party has been too focused on building its own authority in recent years instead of building government institutions.</p> <p>\"On the human rights side his legacy will be much more questionable,\" Lefkow told the Associated Press. \"The country remains under a very tightly controlled one-party rule and this will be the challenge for the new leadership, to take advantage of the opportunity that his death presents in terms of bringing Ethiopia into a more human rights-friendly, reform-minded style of leadership.\"</p> <p>Meles's government has been criticised for its use of arbitrary detention, torture and surveillance of opposition members inside Ethiopia. The ONLF, an opposition group that consists mostly of ethnic Somalis, has openly clashed with the government, including in 2007 when Ethiopia sent troops to Somalia to fight al-Shabaab militants.</p> <p>During Meles's election win in 2005, when it appeared the opposition was likely to make gains, Meles tightened security across the country, and on the night of the election he declared a state of emergency, outlawing any public gathering as his ruling party claimed a majority win. Opposition members accused Meles of rigging the election, and demonstrations broke out. Security forces moved in, killing hundreds of people and jailing thousands. Almost the entire leadership of an opposition group that won an unprecedented number of seats in parliament was jailed for life for treason.</p> <p>In 2009, an anti-terror law was enacted, under which more than 100 opposition figures have since been arrested. The government insists it is tackling rebel groups that have links with al-Qaida and Eritrea.</p> <p>More than 10 journalists have also been charged under the law, according to the <a href=\"http://cpj.org/\" title=\"\">Committee to Protect Journalists</a>. The group says Ethiopia is close to replacing Eritrea as the African country with the highest number of journalists behind bars. Two Swedish journalists were jailed for 11 years on charges of entering the country illegally and aiding a rebel group.</p> <p>Navi Pillay, the UN high commissioner of human rights, has criticised the verdicts, saying journalists, human rights defenders and critics were facing a \"climate of intimidation\".</p> <p>Meles responded with trademark defiance, labelling the duo as \"messenger boys of terror groups\".</p> <p>In 2010, Meles won a further five years in office while receiving a reported 99% of the vote in an election that the US and other international observers said did not meet international standards.</p> <p>Meles was the leader of a political coalition known as the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front. He was also the longtime chairman of the Tigray People's Liberation Front and has always identified strongly with his party.</p> <p>When asked what he thought would be his legacy, Meles once said: \"I cannot separate my achievements from what can be considered as the achievements of the ruling party. Whatever achievement there might have been, it does not exist independent of that party.\"</p> <p>Under Meles, Ethiopia recorded improvements in education with the construction of new schools and universities. Women gained more rights. And in the mid-2000s Ethiopia experienced strong economic growth, tripling in size in 15 years, which won Meles plaudits. The International Monetary Fund in 2008 said Ethiopia's economy had grown faster than any non-oil exporting country in sub-Saharan Africa.</p> <p>The prime minister forged close business ties with India and Turkey as well as China, which footed the $200m bill for the sprawling, new headquarters of the African Union in Addis Ababa.</p> <p>Despite those gains, Ethiopia remains heavily dependent on agriculture, which accounts for 85% of employment. Per capita income is only about $1,000 \u2013 about $3 a day.</p> <p>Meles is survived by his wife, Azeb Mesfin, an MP, with whom he had three children. State TV said funeral arrangements would be announced soon.</p>",
