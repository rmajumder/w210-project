  "<p>David Cameron is taking the brave, if slightly foolhardy, step of following in the footsteps of Boris Johnson and will appear on the Late Show with David Letterman in New York on Wednesday night.</p> <p>The prime minister, who believes he has a sharper wit than his fellow Etonian, appears to think he will have little difficulty in coping with the CBS host.</p> <p>Downing Street said that the prime minister would use his appearance on the David Letterman show to \"bang the drum for British business\" during a two day visit to New York that begins on Tuesday.</p> <p>No 10's approach suggests that Cameron may not have brushed up on Letterman's razor-sharp approach. Johnson was almost stumped for words in June when Letterman asked him how long he had been cutting his hair.</p> <p>Downing Street said of the prime minister's appearance, which will follow his speech to the UN general assembly: \"Around a busy schedule of bilaterals and diplomatic work, the prime minister will seize on the legacy of the London Olympics to further promote Britain as a guest on CBS's Late Show with David Letterman. Reaching on average over three million viewers a night, the prime minister is due to appear on Wednesday's show to highlight all that Britain has to offer and to encourage more Americans to visit or to set up a business here.\"</p> <p>Letterman may swot up on British business and ask the prime minister earnest questions about opportunities for US businesses in Britain. Then again he might ask the prime minister about life as a fifth cousin of the Queen.</p> <p>Andrew Mitchell, the chief whip, is hardly a household name in the US. But Letterman may be tempted to ask the prime minister about Britain's public schools as Mitchell, known as \"Thrasher\" at Rugby School, fights to save his political career.</p> <p>Cameron may follow the example of Barack Obama who sailed through his recent appearance on the Letterman show. But then Obama handed Letterman a scoop \u2013 his first television interview since Mitt Romney dismissed 47% of US voters as benefit scroungers.</p> <p>In one of his first engagements in New York, Cameron will issue a stern warning to world leaders to do more to meet the eight millennium development goals before a deadline in 2015. It is widely believed that the developed world, which had pledged to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger and achieve universal primary education, is way off track.</p> <p>The prime minister, who will co-chair the first meeting of the UN high level panel on the post-millennium development goals, will say: \"Less than half of the 142 objectives that underpin the eight MDGs are on track to meet the 2015 targets. So the first thing we must do is send a clear message to everyone who signed up to millennium development goals \u2013 that now is the time to step up and honour those promises.</p> <p>\"I know there are some who say we can't afford to do that right now. They believe we have to focus on ourselves. And if that means breaking promises, then they're sorry \u2013 but it just has to be done. Well I'm sorry, but it doesn't.</p> <p>\"When we make a promise to the poorest people in the world, we should keep it \u2013 not turn our back on people who are trusting us to help them. More than five thousand infants die every day from preventable diseases like pneumonia and diarrhoea. So to those who say we can't afford to act. I say, we can't afford to wait.\"</p> <p>The prime minister will reaffirm his commitment to meeting the UN target of spending 0.7% of gross national income on overseas aid by 2013. He will also outline Britain's role in helping to vaccinate more than 12 million children against preventable diseases and supporting 5.3 million children to go to primary school.</p>",
  "<p>Mr Luthra, the shopkeeper in my local market who sells me ancient imported cheese, packets of sliced salami and a variety of other once-scarce western delicacies that he produces like some kind of illicit contraband from a fridge buried in the back of his store, has views on many subjects.</p> <p>Oddly, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/21/indian-life-extinguished-by-supermarkets\" title=\"\">new measure</a> brought in by the Indian government last week to allow foreign supermarket chains to sell directly to customers rather than retailers such as him is not among them. Though he is one of the millions of small businessmen who critics of the new measure say are likely to lose their livelihoods, Mr Luthra is unconcerned, even when told Walmart has said it hopes to open a&#xa0;store in India within a year to 18 months.</p> <p>\"I have been here 30 years. I know everybody. They know me. How can some American compete with that?\" he asks.</p> <p>Fly into Delhi and you'll arrive at the international airport's new terminal building, opened&#xa0;in 2010. It is a vast sprawl of glass, steel and orange&#xa0;carpets, and it is busy 24/7. It is a concrete \u2013 in every sense of the word \u2013 manifestation of what 20 years of sustained economic growth can produce. Since a package of reforms designed largely by the then finance minister Manmohan Singh was implemented in the early&#xa0;90s, India \u2013 or rather, some Indians \u2013 have enjoyed the effects of an economy expanding by&#xa0;up to 9% each year. The amount that has trickled down to the most needy may have been&#xa0;derisory, but that huge sums of cash have been created is undeniable. A recent report from the Indian National Council of Applied Economic Research quoted in the local Hindustan Times said that the famous <a href=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/WorldEconomy/Pleasure-pain-generation/Article1-934181.aspx\" title=\"\">\"Indian middle class\"</a> grew&#xa0;from 2.7% of the population in 1995-96 to&#xa0;nearly 13% today.</p> <p>Leave the airport and within a few minutes you&#xa0;will have really entered India. The roads are&#xa0;chaotic, clogged and pitted, a new tunnel ends&#xa0;beside a shanty town and the new Metro link to the airport is broken. All the gaps in&#xa0;India's growth story \u2013 so often ignored in&#xa0;the west and elsewhere \u2013 are glaringly obvious. The most recent batch of Indian reforms, introduced by the very same Manmohan Singh, now prime minister, is inspired by the fear that these holes will swallow all the progress of the past decade if drastic action is not&#xa0;taken soon.</p> <p>Whether they are implemented could determine if India's growth picks up&#xa0;again, whether it continues to flatline or whether it continues to slow, with India set back several decades in shortish order.</p> <p>Up in South Block, part of the monumental red&#xa0;sandstone complex designed by the British to house their administrative staff in the centre of what they called New Delhi, close aides explain that Singh's sudden courage stems neither from fears of further loss of confidence in international markets, nor from concern over his \"legacy\", but&#xa0;from victory in an internal battle within his&#xa0;own party.</p> <p>The ruling Congress party has long been split between those favouring economic policies that owe much to the decades of socialist-style central&#xa0;planning and those looking to boost private-sector growth and foreign investment and&#xa0;cut back state spending. But first came a change in finance minister and then the party president Sonia Gandhi was convinced by Singh that unless some money was generated soon, the&#xa0;various big dole schemes she believes are essential to improving the lot of India's poor (and&#xa0;her party's electoral chances) could not be&#xa0;funded.</p> <p>\"It's understood now that without money there is no welfare,\" an aide to the prime minister&#xa0;says. \"There are many more [reforms] to&#xa0;come.\"</p> <p>This is a huge shift, in a country that is home to around a fifth of the world's population. But the problem is that the most recent reforms, though impressive in the context, are less so in the grand economic scheme of things. They may bring in a little more investment and reassure the markets, but they won't tackle the real fundamental bottlenecks that are stifling growth \u2013 runaway public expenditure or the soaring inflation that punishes the poor most. For this, lots of new legislation is needed. Even the PM's loyal aide, particularly as last week's announcements cost the government a coalition partner, admits that new laws are impossible.</p> <p>The result then is that India, at least until the next election in 2014 and almost certainly beyond, will not see the deep reform needed to return to high growth. It will putter on at 6% at best. A lot by current western standards, but economists here say it is only just about enough to meet&#xa0;the current needs of the growing population.</p> <p>Outside the prime minister's office, the sun is slanting across the stupendous vista down towards the India Gate. It&#xa0;is the first evening that is cool enough to convince me that the brutal&#xa0;summer is once more over. Children play, exhausted labourers sleep under trees, couples are strolling on the thick, monsoon rain-watered grass and the sellers of street snacks are doing brisk business. Like Mr Luthra, no one&#xa0;seems very worried about the imminent arrival of Walmart.</p>",
  "<p>It is said there's someone for everyone. Who would have predicted, when Todd Akin, the Republican representative, was abandoned by his party for his \"legitimate rape\" comments a month ago, Newt Gingrich would be his knight in shining armour.</p> <p>But at the first major fundraising event held by the Akin campaign since the Missouri senate candidate was blackballed by the party funders and leaders, Gingrich pledged his support and said he was just the first in a wave of well-known Republicans to stand by Akin.</p> <p>Republican party leaders have said the controversial remarks have made it impossible for Akin to unseat incumbent US senator Claire McCaskill. They have pleaded with him to step down in time to name a replacement for the election.</p> <p>Gingrich came to Missouri on Monday to back Akin at a $500-a-ticket fundraising lunch, at which he addressed about 50 of the congressman's supporters \u2013 and earlier, the media.</p> <p>At at a press conference at a train station in Kirkwood, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri, Gingrich said Akin was running a winnable race and made his own prediction \u2013 that the national Republican leaders, including Mitt Romney, would reverse track and back the candidate once they \"adjust to the reality\" that he is staying in the race.</p> <p>\"If Todd and the people of Missouri prove it's a close race, what's the moral case for not backing the Republican nominee?\" Gingrich said.</p> <p>Gingrich told the crowd, made up of reporters and a handful of supporters that it all came down to a simple question. \"Do you want to keep Harry Reid as the majority leader?\" Gingrich said to shouts of \"No\" from Akin supporters.</p> <p>Gaining McCaskill's seat is seen as vital if the GOP is to take over the Senate in November. \"How do you go back to your donors and say: 'Let's throw the Senate away?',\" Gingrich said.</p> <p>The former presidential candidate dismissed comments on Sunday by Republican national committee chairman Reince Preibus who declared on TV that there was no way any RNC money would be used to help Akin. \"My expectation would be that in the crunch, in October, governor Romney is going to be for the entire ticket, and he's going to be for Todd Akin,\" Gingrich said.</p> <p>He compared Akin to Harry Truman, senator and later president who was dumped by the party machine in the 1940s.</p> <p>The fundraiser would have netted Akin up to $42,000 from the cost of the tickets alone, in addition to the $600,000 Akin has already raised online.<br>Rick Tyler, a former longterm aide to Gingrich, who is now advising Akin, said he had \"adequate funding\" to fight the election.</p> <p>The polls are showing a close contest, and Tuesday is the last day that Akin could seek a court order to drop out. On Monday, he reaffirmed that he had no plans to withdraw, telling supporters that a number of prominent Republicans have already agreed to campaign on his behalf but declining to name names. He begins a four-day \"Common Sense\" bus tour.</p> <p>Akin has aplogised for the remarks on \"legitimate rape\" he made in a televised interview and has even drummed up a \"Women for Akin\" group. <a href=\"http://www.akin.org/campaign/missouri-women-stand-todd-akin\">A video on his website</a> has one woman weeping as she recounted having an abortion as she endorses the pro-life candidate she said speaks up for women.</p> <p>His supporters say he a mistake and should be forgiven for it. Paula Ritter, 78, who was at Kirkwood station with her husband to support Akin said he and other politicians needed to learn \"who they are talking to\". \"I think he's sorry. But I don't think he's sorry for thinking that\" she said. Ritter said she didn't agree with him \"but I wouldn't change my vote because of it. I'm not for single-issue politics\".</p> <p>Gingrich joked: \"if saying something dumb disqualifies you, Joe Biden couldn't be vice-president.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396631025\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/24/1348525557579/gingrich-akin-protests-010.jpg\" alt=\"gingrich akin protests\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">About 50 people gathered outside the fundraiser to protest Akin's candidacy.  Photograph: Karen McVeigh/The Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen McVeigh/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Akin's comments stirred up a wave of outrage and added to the perception of the so-called \"war on women\" among conservative Republicans.</p> <p>Outside the Branica restaurant where the former House speaker addressed some 50 Akin supporters, a similar-sized crowd had gathered to protest. One held up a banner which said: \"Lets shut Todd Akin down\" in reference to his comments that rape victims had a way of \"shutting down\" pregnancies.</p> <p>Jane Von Kaenel said his remarks had re-invigorated the feminist base in Missouri. \"He's an embarrassment, he's out of touch,\" she said of Akin. \"You just can't hold your nose and get away from the smell.\" She said she thought that \"many, many\" Republicans would vote for McCaskill.</p> <p>Susan Cunningham, 73, a retired teacher from Pacific, in Franklin, Missouri, who was holding the banner declaring \"Let's shut down Todd Akin\" said she was worried about Republican party becoming more and more conservative on social issues. She said: \"I'm very worried about what is happening in this country. I'm against Todd Akin's voting record on everything, from women's issues, to the environment and education.\"</p> <p>\"I don't understand why Newt Gingrich is supporting him, but to be honest I don't understand why Newt Gingrich does anything. Newt must have an ulterior motive. They are blowing smoke and they are very good at it. But Todd Akin is scary. When I think of my daughter and my grandchildren, are they going to have access to birth control of are they going to have to put a veil on? It's crazy here, we are going backwards.\"</p> <p>Gingrich refused to say what conversations he had with the party leadership that led him to predict a u-turn on Akin.</p> <p>Asked if anyone from the party had tried to stop him from coming out in support of Akin, he said: \"I'm not going to talk about my conversations with party leadership.\"</p> <p>Tyler, a former long-term aide to Gingrich who now works for Akin, said he thought the candidate would raise an \"adequate amount\" of money to stay in the race, but added that he believed if would be \"political malpractice\" if the Republican party did not get back behind him.</p> <p>Marsha Walker, a social worker from Chesterfield, who attended the fundraiser, said she hoped the voters would forgive Akin his remarks. She said she was voting for him because of his strong pro-life views.</p> <p>\"Everyone who has spoken has erred in some way, and not to forgive is unforgivable. We need someone like Todd to fight for morality in Washington, and Todd is s a fighter.\"</p>",
  "<p>Until Andrew Mitchell swears that he never used the word pleb, we assume that he did. Until the chief whip has the police officers sacked for giving false witness, we assume that he did. His <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/24/andrew-mitchell-reiterates-apology-police\" title=\"\">carefully worded non-apology</a> dared not deny he said it \u2013 so he did.</p> <p>The Sun, with its notoriously close contacts inside the Met, <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/politics/4553515/Official-police-report-shows-Andrew-Mitchell-called-PCs-plebs.html\" title=\"\">produces chapter and verse</a>, written down by the officers in self-protection after Mitchell's parting shout: \"You haven't heard the last of this!\" Downing Street briefers' claiming that this is all a Police Federation scam won't wash. Why not? No one thinks those police officers invented that particular word. \"Best learn your fucking place\" and \"You're fucking plebs\" is Flashman public school bully-speak of Mitchell's generation, far too authentic to fake. If he was younger, Mitchell might have said \"chav\", as Princes William and Harry do: remember their chav party, dressing up in what they imagined were lower-class clothes.</p> <p>David Cameron should have sacked Mitchell instantly to stop that word dogging his government for ever. \"Pleb\" says not just how Cameron and co think, but it defines with deadly accuracy who they govern for. This stamps them as a Mitt Romney regime \u2013 not bothering with the plebs, not with the bottom half. This crystallises how they ignore those who are not their voters, not their leafy shire constituents. They govern for those who their class sometimes calls PLUs \u2013 \"people like us\". The social class of Cameron's crew hardly matters: what counts is whose side they are on. Without a shadow of a doubt, they rule for their own ruling class.</p> <p>\"Plebs\" means the great mass of people not like them \u2013 casting all low-earners in the same pool, how cleverly Iain Duncan Smith, Chris Grayling and the prime minister elide the dysfunctional few with the great majority of the poor who work, but can't earn enough. The media helps, even the BBC, in programmes such as Neighbourhood Watched, seeking out the telegenic worst, maddest and most helpless on housing estates: job done, that's the plebs in social housing, that's everyone on benefits or on credits. Little wonder the public turns against paying for them. Of course, it's far too dull to film toiling but grossly underpaid cleaners, guards and carers.</p> <p>The head of the Institute for Fiscal Studies told the Liberal Democrats some uncomfortable truths at their conference in Brighton this week. Under banners reading \"Fairer tax in tough times\", Paul Johnson told them that their much-vaunted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2012/mar/09/budget-2012-personal-tax-allowance-unfair\" title=\"\">raising of the tax threshold</a> so that no one pays tax until earning over \u00a310,000 did little for the low-paid. The main gainers, he said, are in the top third of incomes. The bottom third already earn too little to pay tax, and the middle third gain little: the top get most. And this policy costs a monumental \u00a310bn that could have been targeted on benefits, tax credits, housing and childcare to help the struggling 50%. But the great austerity \u2013 especially the \u00a318bn of benefit cuts \u2013 fell on them.</p> <p>What would fairer tax look like? Council tax is the most regressive \u2013 the more expensive the property, the lower the proportion of tax paid \u2013 so correct that first, and then turn to a mansion tax. Britain's wealth taxes have atrophied. Inheritance tax doesn't work, capital gains entirely forgiven at death. As for the 50p top tax rate, because the rich had a year's notice they took their income in the year before it was introduced. Then, as soon as the cut to 45% was announced a year ahead, they delayed their income until it came in. This two-year tax planning, says the IFS, cost the exchequer \u00a318bn. That's the same as the \u00a318bn cut from the poorest.</p> <p>It shows just what colossal discretionary sums float among the few at the top: a one-off levy could solve half the national debt while barely touching their lifestyles. The rich protest it's unfair that the top few contribute nearly 30% of income tax. But that's because they command such a gigantic share of national income. Their plea worked and the cut brought millionaires an extra \u00a314,000 each.</p> <p>Defending that cut, David Laws, now back in government, says: \"As a liberal, I feel uncomfortable at the idea of the state taking half or more of anyone's income.\" So will Vince Cable win his mansion tax? The business secretary told the BBC on Monday that he still had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/sep/24/lib-dem-conference-cable-clegg-live\" title=\"\">\"some persuasion to do\" with George Osborne</a> \u2013 though he would take a quite modest \u00a32bn.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/who-gains-growth-living-standards-2020/\" title=\"\">Resolution Foundation's latest report \u2013 Who Gains from Growth?</a> \u2013 shows the frightening pace at which the rich will get richer as the 50% of middle and low earners fall away over the next eight years. The IFS has calculated that even if growth leaps ahead with no more cuts, middle incomes will drop 3% while those of the low-paid will fall a frightening 15%. But those on \u00a350,000-plus will see earnings rise. If growth, as expected, is slower, then the prognosis is worse. The squeezed middle is being crushed.</p> <p>As ever, the Lib Dems strive to convince on social justice. Nick Clegg says he will block any further welfare cuts unless he gets a wealth tax: small comfort to the low-paid being hit yet again. He and his party are in denial about almost everything the coalition does to accelerate inequality. A living wage, a chance to earn, serious craft apprenticeships, an affordable home \u2013 all are slipping from the \"pleb\" 50%.</p> <p>on Monday an attempt to slow the ferocity of the great austerity failed at the conference, though its mover said: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/sep/24/lib-dem-conference-cable-clegg-live\" title=\"\">\"Keynes would have held the party's economic policy in contempt.\"</a> Lib Dem ministers stamped on it, even the supposedly radical Tim Farron warning hysterically that only Plan A \"stands between us and market chaos\". Cable spoke well, warning that any more cuts would be on a down escalator to a higher deficit \u2013 apparently not noticing that's exactly what is happening. Social democrat at heart he may be, but like the rest he colludes in Osborne's anti-Keynesianism that stifles growth. \"As a real pleb\" he joked about himself, and brought the house down \u2013 but like the rest he doesn't govern for them.</p> <p>Andrew Mitchell has made a gift to Labour. But it will need policies of unaccustomed radicalism to turn back this great tide of inequality, inheriting a country yet more deeply divided by policies that punish the plebs most.</p> <p><em>Dogma and Disarray \u2013 Cameron at Half-Time, by Polly Toynbee and David Walker, is available from </em><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/home.do?gclid=CPvnnrL5zrICFWLHtAodyxIAFA\" title=\"\"><em>guardianbookshop.co.uk</em></a></p>",
  "<p>We could call it Romnesia: the ability of the very rich to forget the context in which they made their money. To forget their education, inheritance, family networks, contacts and introductions. To forget the workers whose labour enriched them. To forget the infrastructure and security, the educated workforce, the contracts, subsidies and bailouts the government provided.</p> <p>Every political system requires a justifying myth. The Soviet Union had Alexey Stakhanov, the miner reputed to have extracted 100 tonnes of coal in six hours. The US had <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragged_Dick\" title=\"\">Richard Hunter</a>, the hero of Horatio Alger's rags-to-riches tales.</p> <p>Both stories contained a germ of truth. Stakhanov worked hard for a cause in which he believed, but his remarkable output was probably faked. When Alger wrote his novels, some poor people had become very rich in the US. But the further from its ideals (productivity in the Soviet Union's case, opportunity in the US) a system strays, the more fervently its justifying myths are propounded.</p> <p>As the developed nations succumb to extreme inequality and social immobility, the myth of the self-made man becomes ever more potent. It is used to justify its polar opposite: an unassailable rent-seeking class, deploying its inherited money to finance the seizure of other people's wealth.</p> <p>The crudest exponent of Romnesia is the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18187364\" title=\"\">Australian mining magnate Gina Rinehart</a>. \"There is no monopoly on becoming a millionaire,\" she insists. \"If you're jealous of those with more money, don't just sit there and complain; do something to make more money yourselves \u2013 spend less time drinking or smoking and socialising and more time working \u2026 Remember our roots, and create your own success.\"</p> <p>Remembering her roots is what Rinehart fails to do. She forgot to add that if you want to become a millionaire \u2013 in her case a billionaire \u2013 it helps to inherit an iron ore mine and a fortune from your father and to ride a spectacular commodities boom. Had she spent her life lying in bed and throwing darts at the wall, she would still be stupendously rich.</p> <p>Rich lists are stuffed with people who either inherited their money or who made it through rent-seeking activities: by means other than innovation and productive effort. They're a catalogue of speculators, property barons, dukes, IT monopolists, loan sharks, bank chiefs, oil sheikhs, mining magnates, oligarchs and chief executives paid out of all proportion to any value they generate. Looters, in short. The richest mining barons are those to whom governments sold natural resources for a song. Russian, Mexican and British oligarchs acquired underpriced public assets through privatisation, and now run a toll-booth economy. Bankers use incomprehensible instruments to fleece their clients and the taxpayer. But as rentiers capture the economy, the opposite story must be told.</p> <p>Scarcely a Republican speech fails to reprise the Richard Hunter narrative, and almost all these rags-to-riches tales turn out to be bunkum. \"Everything that Ann and I have,\" Mitt Romney claims, \"we earned the old-fashioned way\". Old fashioned like Blackbeard, perhaps. Two searing exposures in Rolling Stone magazine document the <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/greed-and-debt-the-true-story-of-mitt-romney-and-bain-capital-20120829\" title=\"\">leveraged buyouts which destroyed viable companies, value and jobs, and the costly federal bailout</a> which saved Romney's political skin.</p> <p>Romney personifies economic parasitism. The financial sector has become a job-destroying, home-breaking, life-crushing machine, which impoverishes others to enrich itself. The tighter its grip on politics, the more its representatives must tell the opposite story: of life-affirming enterprise, innovation and investment, of brave entrepreneurs making their fortunes out of nothing but grit and wit.</p> <p>There is an obvious flip side to this story. \"Anyone can make it \u2013 I did without help\", translates as \"I refuse to pay taxes to help other people, as they can help themselves\": whether or not they inherited an iron ore mine from daddy. In the article in which she urged the poor to emulate her, Rinehart also proposed that the minimum wage should be reduced. Who needs fair pay if anyone can become a millionaire?</p> <p>In 2010, the richest 1% in the US captured an astonishing 93% of that year's gain in incomes. In the same year, corporate chief executives made, on average, 243 times as much as the median worker (in 1965 the ratio was 10 times lower). Between <a href=\"http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/23/was-greed-good/\" title=\"\">1970 and 2010</a>, the Gini coefficient, which measures inequality, rose in the US from 0.35 to 0.44: an astounding leap.</p> <p>As for social mobility, of the rich countries listed by the OECD, the three in which men's earnings are most likely to resemble their father's are, in this order, <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/tax/publicfinanceandfiscalpolicy/45002641.pdf\" title=\"\">the UK, Italy and the US</a>. If you are born poor or born rich in these nations, you are likely to stay that way. It is no coincidence that these three countries all promote themselves as lands of unparalleled opportunity.</p> <p>Equal opportunity, self-creation, heroic individualism: these are the myths that predatory capitalism requires for its political survival. Romnesia permits the ultra-rich both to deny the role of other people in the creation of their own wealth and to deny help to those less fortunate than themselves. A century ago, entrepreneurs sought to pass themselves off as parasites: they adopted the style and manner of the titled, rentier class. Today the parasites claim to be entrepreneurs.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeorgeMonbiot\" title=\"\"><em>@GeorgeMonbiot</em></a></p> <p>A fully referenced version of this article can be found at <a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com/\" title=\"\">www.monbiot.com</a></p>",
  "<p>In a parking bay on a deserted industrial estate in Lyon, Karen, in her late 40s, sat in the passenger seat of her second-hand Ford Transit van wearing only black underwear. It was 7.30pm on a Friday night. She lit a pink lantern on the dashboard. Soon, a steady flow of cars was circling the car park \u2013 Mercedes, jeeps, old bangers \u2014 their drivers slowing to peer at the women in corsets sitting alone in a dozen parked, white vans, arms folded, candlelight flickering across their faces. \"Some men drive round for hours just staring,\" she said. \"Then they'll stop, ask the price, and demand a discount. I'll say, 'What, for all that petrol you've wasted?'\"</p> <p>A silver car slowed. \"20 euros for a blow job, 40 euros for 'love',\" she smiled. \"Too expensive,\" said the man, accelerating. A 60-year-old agreed to sex for 40 euros. Karen climbed into the back of the van, which she had decorated with a bed, a heater, purple curtains and a chest of drawers. Three minutes later the man walked out into the night. Karen laid out a clean sheet of paper-towel on the bed, spruced her blond hair. \"See, it's all very quick,\" she said. Most of the evening was spent sitting waiting. Then in 15 minutes, three clients paid for sex, including a Spanish man in his 20s in designer clothes. Each took less than five minutes. She had made her daily quota of cash needed to pay her bills.</p> <p>A former secretary from the southern naval city of Toulon, three times married, with two daughters, Karen first started selling sex in the 1980s: a brief stint on the street near a Lyon station, working mainly in clients' cars, \"which is very uncomfortable\". She quit and got married, but in 1992, divorced and with a young child she suddenly needed to \"put food on the table\". She returned to sex-work, first in a hostess bar, then meeting clients at her home via a newspaper small-ad. For seven years, she has worked on the street in her van, Monday to Saturday from 7pm to around 1am, paying tax as self-employed. \"'No pimp, no boss' is my motto. I'd rather do this than an office job, getting shouted at by a boss for a pittance.\" Her strict rules include condoms for everything and no kissing clients. \"You have to hit rock bottom to do this,\" she said. \"It's not an easy job, but it's a job where you can make money quickly. People try to say we're victims, say that we're alienated, that there's a sex attack in our childhood history, but I've never been raped by anyone. This is my free choice.\" She never looks into a client's eyes in the moment of a sexual exchange \u2013 \"I look anywhere but\" \u2013 and they rarely tell her their names. But in her top drawer beside the condom supplies is a petition signed by several of them: in neat writing, stating their profession: such as \"public works\" or \"driver\". It's a protest against the new French government's war on prostitution.</p> <p>Sex work was hardly a priority in the French election campaign, yet it has become one of the defining social issues of Francois Hollande's new Socialist government. In June, the women's minister, Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, made the bold announcement that she wanted to \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/jun/22/french-minister-abolition-prostitution-europe?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"abolish prostitution\">abolish prostitution</a>\" in France and Europe. \"My objective, like that of the Socialist party, is to see prostitution disappear,\" she said. The previous French parliament had already adopted a resolution aiming for a \"society without prostitution\". But can a government rid society of paid sex? The debate is raging among French intellectuals. Sex workers have taken to the streets, accusing the government of moralistic paternalism, saying Socialists are using the issue to distance themselves from the pariah <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/dominique-strauss-kahn?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"Dominique Strauss-Kahn\">Dominique Strauss-Kahn</a>. DSK, once the Socialist hope for president, is under official investigation in France over complicity in a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/mar/26/dominique-strauss-kahn-charged-prostitution-ring\" title=\"pimping operation\">pimping operation</a> after sex workers were allegedly procured for his orgies. He said he didn't pay and didn't know the women were sex workers. \"I challenge you to distinguish a naked prostitute from any other naked woman,\" <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17110618\" title=\"his lawyer told the press\">his lawyer told the press</a>. The inquiry has been extended to examine alleged group rape over the question of whether one sex worker was forced. Strauss-Kahn denies any violence.</p> <p>The \"white van women\" selling sex on Lyon's industrial estate in Gerland embody the French state's difficult attitudes to prostitution. As in the UK, prostitution itself \u2013 receiving money for sex, or paying for sex \u2013 is not a crime. But activities around it are. Laws prohibit pimping, human trafficking, buying sex from a minor and soliciting sex in public. Brothels were outlawed in 1946.</p> <p>Lyon, France's third biggest city, which has around 600 street prostitutes, has always been at the heart of sex worker protests. In 1975, more than 100 prostitutes occupied a church in the city complaining about police harassment, sparking similar protests across France until riot police evicted them. Now the Lyon Transit vans are the new frontline. In 2003, Nicolas Sarkozy, then interior minister, introduced a controversial law against soliciting, making it illegal to stand in a public place known for prostitution dressed in revealing clothes. To get round this, women started working in private vans. Selling sex inside a vehicle was not breaking the law. But police are now using any means to crack down on the growing number of sex-work vans, namely parking tickets and tow-trucks. In Lyon, sex workers complain of constant parking fines and being towed to the pound. Some on the industrial estate owe thousands of euros in parking tickets and pound-release fines accrued each month. \"You can get two parking tickets in 20 minutes, or be towed away on Tuesday, pay a fine, and be towed again on Thursday,\" said one. The women stand their ground. One drives 500km from Bordeaux each week, works and sleeps in her van for four days and nights, before going home. Others travel to the area from Burgundy or Paris.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396601019\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/24/1348492305100/sex-workers-take-part-in--010.jpg\" alt=\"sex workers take part in an anti-abolition demonstration takes part in a demo\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sex-workers in Lyon protest against the government's plans to penalise their clients. Photograph: Jean-Philippe Ksiazek/AFP/Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jean-Philippe Ksiazek/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The government is planning a major consultation on the abolition of prostitution. One idea under consideration is to criminalise the client, meaning anyone who buys sex from a sex worker would face prison and a fine. There are only a handful of European countries where clients of sex workers face prison. In 1999, Sweden became the first, followed by Norway and Iceland. But it is far from certain that France will put it on the statute books. The French Socialists would like their abolitionist stance to be mirrored in Europe, namely in the country they see as closest in its attitude to prostitution: the UK. Other neighbours have radically different approaches: in Germany, prostitution is legal and municipally regulated; in Spain, vast borderland brothels in places such as La&#xa0;Jonquera in Catalonia are frequented by French clients.</p> <p>In a cafe near Place de Clichy, in northern Paris, Elizabeth, 49, and seven Algerian transgender sex workers were having coffee before going to work on the streets in the west of Paris. Elizabeth, originally from Cali in Colombia, had arrived in her blue Citro\u00ebn people carrier, which with a mattress in the boot doubled as her workspace in Paris's Bois de Boulogne park, where she sells sex from 11am to 6pm each weekday, for \u00a440. The Bois de Boulogne, a favourite daytime jogging spot of Sarkozy's, is a centre of the crackdown on prostitutes' vans. Elizabeth has had more than 60 parking tickets this year. \"I'm considering a hunger strike against the idea of criminalising clients,\" she said. \"If clients risk prison, sex work will be forced underground and into apartments, pimps will benefit, sex workers' security will be compromised. Already the mere talk of clients being criminalised means there are less customers on the street.\"</p> <p>For Elizabeth, transsexual sex work is a reflection of daily discrimination. \"As a transsexual, you can't find work, no one will rent you an apartment, it's a difficult existence. Often this seems the only option,\" she said. Two months ago, Jasmine, 30, started working on a road in the Bois de Boulogne after leaving Algiers. \"I can't go back to Algeria because of the way I look. My parents think I'm waiting tables here. I just want a normal life as a transsexual, to run a shop or a hairdressers. But I have to pay \u00a440 a night to live in a dire hotel room with no toilet. This is the only way I can get the money. I work a few hours a night, 11pm until 2am. I try to choose men in their 40s, who I think are safe. I'm really scared on the street, but I'm most scared of the police.\"</p> <p>The government estimates there are 20,000 prostitutes in France, with between 5,000 and 8,000 in Paris. <a href=\"http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/13/rap-info/i3334.asp#P1540_313484\" title=\"A parliamentary report last year\">A parliamentary report last year</a> by a rightwing and a Socialist MP who proposed criminalising clients said 90% of street prostitutes were foreign and 80% of sex workers in France were victims of sex trafficking. Where 20 years ago the majority of street prostitutes were French, most are now foreign and criminal networks are increasing, most recently involving Nigerian women or Romanians trafficking Albanians or Moldovans.</p> <p>In July, six Romanians appeared in court outside Paris charged with pimping: accused of beating women, confiscating their passports and forcing them to work as prostitutes. Last November a similar Romanian network was dismantled, including minors made to work in the Bois de Boulogne. The paper Le Progr\u00e8s reported that this summer in Lyon police discovered a Chinese woman in her 30s shut in an apartment she hadn't left for three weeks, forced to sell sex according to a \"menu\" of services translated into Chinese. Clients had replied to a small ad for \"massages\". But far from trusting the police to protect sex workers, the atmosphere is one of fear and hostility. Some sex workers complain of being insulted and assaulted: in Colmar in 2010, two police officers and a train-worker for the SNCF national rail were convicted of raping a Romanian sex worker. Other allegations of rape are going through the courts.</p> <p>Meanwhile the state is under pressure to do more against trafficking and sexual slavery. Rights groups say not enough support and protection has been given to trafficked women who cooperate to denounce their abusers.</p> <p>\"Instead of grandstanding about abolishing all prostitution, why don't they immediately end the prostitution of minors and human trafficking? They've already got all the laws to stop that, yet it still exists,\" said a male sex worker in his 20s, who works nights in the forest of Fontainebleau outside Paris.</p> <p>There is fierce debate in France over whether all sex workers should be considered victims, or whether \"independents\", without pimps and beginning to be unionised, should be viewed as separate. Pro-abolition feminists say the act of paying for sex is always an act of violence, forcing the sex worker to anaesthetise themselves and cut themselves off from their own body to endure it. \"Slavery hasn't been eradicated, but it has been abolished. The same choice for prostitution would be an advance for civilisation,\" said the feminist Sylviane Agacinski. Another high-profile feminist, Elisabeth Badinter, co-wrote a counter-argument saying talk of abolishing prostitution was based on \"two debatable assumptions: that charging for sex is an affront to women's dignity and that all prostitutes are victims of their bastard clients\". She said a woman selling sex was \"not necessarily a victim of male oppression\". And not all clients were \"horrible predators or sexual obsessives who treat the woman as disposable objects\".</p> <p>Clo\u00e9 Navarro, 27, spokeswoman for the Strass, the French sex workers' union, studied as a nurse and now sells sex on the street in the west of Paris to pay for her postgraduate studies for work with autistic children. She says she feels safer on the street, working in clients' cars or hotels, rather than on the internet, where she can't see the man before accepting an encounter. \"This is not a job everyone can do, but it's a real job. You need a lot of empathy. People come to us with problems. Sometimes I think I've got the word 'nurse' stamped on my forehead,\" she said. She described clients as \"everyone\", from 20s to 70s, widowers, men with disabilities, \"a high percentage\" of new fathers with babies and toddlers. \"This government is stigmatising sex workers. I work one street away from a police station. The abolitionist approach would push sex work into a no-man's land where we are more likely be attacked,\" she said.</p> <p>The new face of the union is its leader, Morgane Merteuil, 25, a postgraduate literature student. She started sex work as a student in a hostess bar in Grenoble, but now works exclusively on the internet as a self-employed escort. A one-time anarchist activist and rebel from a conservative provincial family, she has just published what she calls a feminist sex workers' manifesto. She balks at \"media cliches\" that sex work divides between low-class work on the street or high-class five-star luxury: \"I don't think I've ever met a client in anything more than a cheap hotel costing \u00a460 a night,\" she said. She rails at the new leftwing government for \"morality politics\" and \"paternalism\", describes sex-work as a job \u2013 \"a necessity, like any other job\" and demands the immediate scrapping of the law against soliciting.</p> <p>In Lyon, Karen was preparing to lock up her van and go home to her boyfriend. \"It's not possible to abolish prostitution,\" she said. \"Look at the death penalty, did that stop murder?\"</p>",
  "<p>Last week, Mitt Romney and President Obama traded insults in a most amazing way, reminding us that success in American politics these days requires two things: saying the most absurd things with a straight face, and maximizing the appearance of differences with your opponent, while minimizing their reality. Consider \u2026</p> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> </p> <blockquote> <p>\"I've learned some lessons. Most important is you can't change Washington from inside, only from the outside.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Romney:</strong> </p> <blockquote> <p>\"He said he can't change Washington from inside. He can only change it from outside. I can change Washington. I will change Washington. We'll get the job done from the inside.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> </p> <blockquote> <p>\"What kind of inside job is he talking about? Is it the job of rubber-stamping the top-down, you're-on-your-own agenda of this Republican Congress? Because if it is, we don't want it \u2026 We don't want an inside job in Washington.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Well, Romney's a pretty obvious case of Mr Insider. But let's look at Obama. He doesn't want an inside job? Over the last four years, Obama has appointed nothing but insiders \u2013 many of whom had actively contributed to the financial crisis and profited from it \u2013 to his administration's senior regulatory, law enforcement, and economic policy jobs. The head of the SEC, Mary Shapiro, was fresh from running the investment banking industry's \"self-regulator\", Finra, which gave her a $9m severance bonus to soften the pain of a low government salary. Her director of enforcement, Robert Khuzami, had been general counsel for the Americas of Deutsche Bank during the bubble.</p> <p>The head of the justice department criminal division, Lanny Breuer, had been in charge of the white-collar criminal defense practice of Covington &amp; Burling, a law firm that represents and lobbies for nearly every major bank. The head of the office of management and budget, Jacob Lew, made millions as the chief financial officer of Citigroup Alternative Investments, even as that group lost billions for Citigroup. As head of the National Economic Council, we got Larry Summers, who as Clinton's treasury secretary pushed through the repeal of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass%E2%80%93Steagall_Act\">Glass-Steagall</a> and a law banning regulation of OTC derivatives, and who then proceeded to make $7m from financial services firms in the year prior to joining the Obama administration (including $135,000 for a single speech to Goldman Sachs). Other senior jobs went to Goldman Sachs lobbyists, investment bankers, private equity executives, and the <a href=\"http://freebeacon.com/obama-administration-hires-lobbyist-it-attacked-in-2008/\">former chief lobbyist of Fannie Mae</a>.</p> <p>And beyond Obama's personnel, there were his policies. He did nothing about the obscene $14bn in bonuses awarded in early 2009 by banks that would literally have been bankrupt without federal bailouts; he failed to prosecute even a single bank or financial executive despite clear evidence of rampant, systemic fraud; and he has since attempted only the most pitiful of systemic reforms.</p> <p>Nor is this pattern restricted to the financial sector: despite the worst oil spill in history, one that killed 11 people, and a lethal mine disaster that followed deception of safety inspectors, there have been no prosecutions of energy executives, either. And it all shows: in this campaign, Obama has actually raised more money than Mitt Romney, the poster boy of plutocracy.</p> <p>Well, I'll be the first to admit that I have a personal axe to grind. Like, how do I know all this stuff? Well, two years ago, I made a <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1645089/\">documentary film about the financial crisis</a>, followed recently by a book. The film, based on a year of research and nearly 100 on-camera interviews, chronicled the thoroughly bipartisan process of deregulation, political corruption, and lack of law enforcement that paved the way for the financial crisis. It concludes with a detailed examination of the Obama administration's abysmal record.</p> <p>The film won the Academy Award for best documentary in 2011; in my Oscar acceptance speech, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpz5DVwnbnk\">I called out the lack of criminal prosecutions</a>, to audience applause. The title of this film? I never thought you'd ask.</p> <p>Inside Job.</p> <p>So there you have it \u2013 my real gripe is that Obama stole my title for his petty spat with Romney, each of them pretending to be the guy who would fix Washington corruption \u2013 when, of course, neither of them would.</p> <p>I should say for the record that despite the foregoing, I support President Obama's re-election. For all Obama's faults, Romney and the new Republican party would be even worse. Obama has at least tried to do a <em>few</em> things, some of the time, however timid. Not to mention little details like gay marriage, abortion, climate change, tax returns, et cetera.</p> <p>But the sad truth is that the more the two candidates pretend to be at each other's throats, the more similar they are in reality, at least where money is concerned. They would both let America's new financial oligarchy run amok, at the nation's great expense. This is just one domain among many in which both candidates avoid the truth, preferring to trade blows in the theater of the absurd.</p>",

Hmm.</p> <p>Laws is going to be quite powerful in the Liberal Democrats in the months and years ahead. Teather was responsible for early years and childcare, whereas Laws covers schools, but that's really just the start of his domain. He also has a \"roving brief\" looking out for Lib Dem interests across the whole department, and in addition is shadowing Tory policy minister Oliver Letwin, which means he is in charge of monitoring every aspect of coalition policy for the Lib Dems - except, he stresses, those that fall to Danny Alexander: the economy, energy and defence.</p> <p>But if he is powerful within the party, he seems less so within his department. Laws was asked a lot about the new ebacc, the qualification replacing GCSEs. He said Lib Dems had altered the policy beyond recognition compared to what it looked like when education secretary Michael Gove first floated it: \"I wouldn't say we tweaked the proposals. Compared to what was [originally] announced in the Daily Mail, this was a completely different set of proposals,\" he said.</p> <p>Lib Dems had also argued that more subjects than just English, maths and science needed to be brought under the ebacc umbrella: \"We don't want a second tier of qualifications which are important but which will be seen to left behind in a discredited brand.\" He would continue to argue for this, he said. \"I suspect the secretary of state doesn't see this as the final word on it.\" But it seemed that it would be Gove rather than Laws having that final word.</p> <p>Similarly, Laws said that despite the huge growth in academy schools, which exist outside local authority control and now make up more than half of all secondaries, there would always be a role for local authorities - but this seemed to be more his prediction than an announcement of the government's position. \"I don't think you can sensibly design an education system for the future for 23,500 schools that relies either on all the schools acting autonomously or some minister taking responsibility for 23,500 schools,\" he said. It was \"not practical\" for a minister to take responsibility for issues such as planning, transport and allocating capital at that local level.</p> <p>Nevertheless, he was \"far from starry-eyed about the role of local authorities in education in the past\", and it was down to Lib Dems to make the case for their new role with that in mind, Laws said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PaulTOwen/status/250273876041408512\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>David Laws at the Lib Dem conference <a href=\"http://t.co/SyDdPFWr\" title=\"http://twitter.com/PaulTOwen/status/250273876041408512/photo/1\">twitter.com/PaulTOwen/stat\u2026</a></p>&mdash; PaulTOwen (@PaulTOwen) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulTOwen/status/250273876041408512\" data-datetime=\"2012-09-24T16:41:57+00:00\">September 24, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50609156c0e327c3f7c90521\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T16:59:06.248Z\">5.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My colleague <strong>Alan Travis</strong> has sent me this from a fringe meeting.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Lord McNally, the last remaining member of Ken Clarke's ministry of justice team, was at a fringe meeting reflecting on Clarke's fate. \"The only benefit of Ken's departure is that the Liberal Democrats will stop giving all the credit to Ken Clarke for any liberal measure the Ministry of Justice takes and may start to give me some credit as well,\" he said.</p> <p>McNally said, somewhat unhappily, that the future in prisons and probation was more market testing, more outsourcing and more payment by results.

Delegates then passed the motion, which criticised Conservatives for refusing to acknowledge that investing in carbon-reducing technologies could make an important contribution to growth.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Jeremy Browne, the Home Office minister, has said that the Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell should explain what he actually said to the police.</strong> While other Liberal Democrats have said little about the Mitchell affair because the party does not want it to distract attention from its conference, Browne said Mitchell's morning apology did not go far enough.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think people want to know what was said. Explaining to the media what was not said is not the same as explaining to the media what was said.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 The Lib Dems have voted for a motion saying the speed limit in urban areas should be cut to 20mph. </strong>Under the plan, all new roads would have a 20mph limit and the government would encourage councils to switch from 30mph to 20mph on existing roads.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 The Lib Dems have backed a motion urging the government to increase the science budget by 3% above inflation for the next 15 years.</strong> Julian Huppert, the MP who moved the motion, said: \"Britain has a proud history of leading the world in science - innovations from British researchers have changed our planet and our way of life. But we are in danger of losing our reputation as a world leader in research and development. We are in danger of limiting our access to vital technological developments and the benefits they bring.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 The Lib Dems have committed themselves to campaign for measures to promote John Lewis-style mutual businesses.</strong> As the Press Association reports, they backed proposals which would give workers in publicly listed firms with more than 250 employees the right to request an employee share scheme.

Reeves declared that \u2018out of necessity, as well as principle, we can\u2019t be a party of the centre left anymore\u2019. Jeremy Browne, the Home Office minister and one of the leading Orange Book liberals, said that \u2018there\u2019s now no need for lazy, leftwing oppositionist people to vote Liberal Democrat as they can now vote Labour\u2019.</p> <p>The implication of all this is that, like Viking warriors, the Liberal Democrats have burnt their boats on the beach by entering government, and now need to make a success of it and stick with Clegg. There\u2019s undoubtedly some truth to this. But the leadership murmurings will continue as long as the polls suggest that Vince Cable would boost the party\u2019s poll ratings.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://yougov.co.uk/news/2012/09/24/clegg-least-popular-party-leader-foot/\">\u2022 Peter Kellner at YouGov looks at Nick Clegg's poll ratings and suggests the Lib Dems will have to replace him before the general election.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After Mr Brown discovered that his remark about Gillian Duffy had been caught on a microphone he wrongly thought was off, he dashed round to her house and told her how sorry he was. The next day we asked people about this apology. Just 26% said it was genuine, while 56% thought it was not. In our latest poll for the Sunday Times, we asked the same question about Mr Clegg\u2019s apology. This time, 40% told us it was genuine, while 35% disagreed.</p> <p>That is where the good news ends. 41% think his apology makes him look weaker, while just 21% think it makes him look stronger. Only 5% say his apology will make them more likely to vote Lib Dem at the next election, while 15% say it makes them less likely. No wonder Lib Dem support is so low \u2013 just 8% in our post-apology poll \u2013 while Mr Clegg himself has slumped to his worst-ever rating. Having risen briefly (after the first leaders\u2019 debate on TV in April 2010) to become more popular than Churchill, he is now Britain\u2019s least popular main-party leader since Michael Foot.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://markreckons.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/interview-with-nick-clegg-part-one.html\">\u2022 Nick Clegg tells Mark Thompson in an interview for his blog that the war on drugs has been a failure.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m at the Liberal Democrat end of this debate in that I start from an assumption that the so-called war on drugs is a spectacular failure and that we\u2019ve got to be driven by evidence, not prejudice nor dogma.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/politics/2012/09/daily-mails-bizarre-attack-cleggs-tax-plan\">\u2022 George Eaton at the Staggers saying people earning more than \u00a350,000 are not representative of the middle class.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As the Office for National Statistics <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ashe/annual-survey-of-hours-and-earnings/ashe-results-2011/ashe-statistical-bulletin-2011.html\">reported</a> last year, the median full-time UK salary is \u00a326,200. Those who earn at least twice as much (as only 10% do) are not, despite the <em>Mail's</em> protestations, entirely representative of the country's middle class. Nor are those whose homes are worth than \u00a31m (as just 3.1% of properties are) easily identifiable as standard bearers of the \"squeezed middle\".

This is yet another government policy thrown into uncertainty by bickering in government before it has even got off the ground.</p> <p>A major problem with the government\u2019s previous failed schemes to get lending going to businesses, including Project Merlin and credit easing, was that they relied on the banks themselves getting money out of the door, without any real safeguards to ensure this happened. It is far from clear that Vince Cable\u2019s business bank will be immune from these shortcomings.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>John Cridland</strong>, the CBI director general:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"Vince Cable concentrated on the key issue of the moment - growth. It is always tempting for politicians to play to their conference gallery, and I am pleased that Vince's speech went to the heart of the growth debate.</p> <p>A new-style boutique, government-backed bank for growth firms can bring something new to the business lending toolkit. The big gripe today from many growth businesses is a gap in the market for long-term investment finance. The new \u00a31bn wholesale fund will enable banks to provide \u201cpatient capital\u201d to high growth businesses.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>John Longworth</strong>, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The business bank announced by Vince Cable could be one of the lasting legacies of this government, and a key pillar of UK competitiveness in the years to come. While a \u00a31bn commitment is an important first step, Whitehall must ensure that the business bank gets off the ground with an independent mandate and a mission to support growing companies.</p> <p>Six in 10 chamber members told us just last week that they would feel more confident in securing finance if Britain had a government-backed business bank. Commercial banks should have a first right of refusal, but, as we have argued before, the business bank will eventually need the infrastructure to make its own decisions on loans, and its own channels to deliver funds to growing businesses.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T14:46:18.888Z\">at 3.46pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5060674158f9bdd2eeba018a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T13:59:30.152Z\">2.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's some Guardian video from the Cable speech.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/video/2012/sep/24/vince-cable-1bn-business-bank-video\"                                data-show-ads=\"true\"                        data-video-name=\"Vince Cable unveils \u00a31bn backing for business bank - video\"                        > <object width=\"460\" height=\"307\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"></param><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/video/embed\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><param name=\"flashvars\" value=\"endpoint=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/video/2012/sep/24/vince-cable-1bn-business-bank-video/json\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/video/embed\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" flashvars=\"endpoint=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/video/2012/sep/24/vince-cable-1bn-business-bank-video/json\" wmode=\"opaque\"></embed></object> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-506062ae58f9bdd2eeba0187\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T13:39:58.529Z\">2.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-237eb050-fe8e-481d-b571-25f2b153181c\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/24/1348493964288/d5052b6a-50eb-4789-a5eb-6d435c7c9591-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Jo Swinson, Danny Alexander, Nick Clegg, Lorely Burt, and Vince Cable vote on a policy motion.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jo Swinson, Danny Alexander, Nick Clegg, Lorely Burt and Vince Cable vote on a policy motion.

This is from my colleague, the Observer's <strong>Daniel Boffey.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A presentation by Rick Nye from pollsters Populus is painting a far from pretty picture for the party. Apart from the slide behind Ukip, as recorded by the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/22/observer-launches-opinium-observer-poll\">Observer/Opinum poll</a> this weekend, there are few signs of hope. Over half of people (57%) in September 2009 believed the Lib Dems were honest and principled. That's now down to 32%. More significantly, their time in government hasn't seen an improvement in people's perception of the party's credibility \u2013 far from it. Two in five (44%) in 2009 believed the party was competent and capable but that is now down to one in five (21%). Around two in five believe the party has made a difference and are<br> responsible, slightly up on 2009. But still only a third (32%) believe coalition governments are strong and decisive, marking a small slide from three years ago.</p> </blockquote> <p>And Daniel has one other nugget.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The discussions also covered Liberal Democrat policy and its failures and successes in the field of civil liberties. In response to some criticism, Ashdown said the draft communications bill on intercepting emails will not be passed by Lib Dems in the Lords.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T13:39:55.464Z\">at 2.39pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50605ce358f9bdd2eeba0184\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T13:15:15.528Z\">2.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here's <strong>Lord Oakeshott</strong> on the Vince Cable speech.

Other parties such as Labour were even more opportunistic, he claimed.</p> <p>A female delegate took him to task for the tuition fees claim. She said that far from it being opportunistic, \"that was the strong feeling of a majority of the party who voted for that policy because they believed it\".</p> <p>Ashdown said he tried to get the party to abandon that policy in 1999 \"but you smashed me into the ground\". He backed Nick Clegg's point that the Lib Dems should have been honest about what was realistic.</p> <p>Ashdown also poured scorn on the polling evidence presented by Populus at the meeting (bad for the Lib Dems in every way), saying that \"anybody who predicts the future from the mid-term polls is talking nonsense \u2026 If you ask people what they're going to do on a wet Saturday afternoon half way through a parliament they usually give the sitting government a kicking.\"</p> <p>He added that \"unpopularity is the price of doing difficult but necessary things \u2026 There's no point in being a liberal if you're a cosy little herbivore.\"</p> <p>Clegg, he said, was \"the best party leader we have had for 100 years, myself included, well, maybe not - yes!\"</p> <p>And he added: \"Do I love the Tories? No I don't. I hate the Tories!\" before taking that back: \"I can't hate anyone; I'm a liberal.\" Nevertheless he had harsh words for the mayor of London, noting: \"Old Boris Johnson is more popular than David Cameron - doesn't mean to say he'd be good as a prime minister, guys - absolutely not.\"</p> <p>And in case you were wondering, yes, Ashdown did repeat his well-worn line that he is \"the only party leader ever represented in the opinion polls by an asterisk, denoting that no discernible support could be found\".</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PaulTOwen/status/250214162960097281\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Populus polling at the Lib Dem conference <a href=\"http://t.co/IX6QlGSi\" title=\"http://twitter.com/PaulTOwen/status/250214162960097281/photo/1\">twitter.com/PaulTOwen/stat\u2026</a></p>&mdash; PaulTOwen (@PaulTOwen) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulTOwen/status/250214162960097281\" data-datetime=\"2012-09-24T12:44:41+00:00\">September 24, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PaulTOwen/status/250214405227282432\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Populus polling at the Lib Dem conference <a href=\"http://t.co/3EcuqWB8\" title=\"http://twitter.com/PaulTOwen/status/250214405227282432/photo/1\">twitter.com/PaulTOwen/stat\u2026</a></p>&mdash; PaulTOwen (@PaulTOwen) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulTOwen/status/250214405227282432\" data-datetime=\"2012-09-24T12:45:38+00:00\">September 24, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50605c17c0e327c3f7c90501\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T13:11:51.152Z\">2.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's <strong>Paddy Ashdown</strong> on Nick Clegg.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;460&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/itmpYw15sxc&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T13:27:15.990Z\">at 2.27pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50604db558f9bdd2eeba017e\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T13:06:29.587Z\">2.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Vince Cable's speech - summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Vince Cable</strong> enjoys writing and his speeches often contain relatively subtle messages. That was certainly true of this one, which was ostensibly about growth and the economy, but actually read like the opening bid in the coalition negotiations for 2015.</p> <p>Here are the main points.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Vince Cable predicted that the next election would result in a hung parliament and he insisted that the Lib Dems would be able to work with either of the two main parties in the national interest.</strong> At least, that's how I read Cable's peroration.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After over two years in government we are battle hardened but certainly not war weary. None of us knows exactly how it will end. But we all know we must fight the next general election as a totally independent, national, credible challenger for power.</p> <p>I don\u2019t believe actually that the British people will want to entrust their future to any one party next time. If Britain wants sustainable growth, competence with compassion, fairness with freedom and more equality, not ever greater division, then that government must have Liberal Democrats at its heart.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cable joked about the reports that he has exchanged text messages with Ed Miliband - \"I have good communications with politicians across the political spectrum,\" he said - and his speech indicated a willingness to work with Labour as well as the Tories. He had this to say about Ed Balls.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our critics on the left say \u2013 \u201ccut more slowly\u201d. The government has already extended the period to eliminate the structural deficit from four to six years. Yet Ed Balls says: \u201cWorkers of the world unite. We need a Plan B. We should not cut the deficit in six years but seven\u201d.</p> </blockquote> <p>That sounds like a jibe, but actually he is saying that there is little difference between Balls's policies and the government's. And Cable was quite positive about George Osborne too. Earlier Danny Alexander (Osborne's Treasury deputy) opened a debate on a motion criticising the Tories (and, by implication, Osborne) over green policies. But Cable was quite complimentary.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When we came into government we had to balance competing risks: of aggravating the economic downturn through excessive cuts versus the risk of losing the confidence of lenders. I believe we struck the right balance and adopted a deficit reduction plan. I make no apology for my continued support for that fiscal discipline.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Cable said the Lib Dems would not let slow growth lead to further spending cuts.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The central point is that the country must not get stuck on a downward escalator where slow or no growth means bigger deficits leading to more cuts and even slower growth. That is the way to economic disaster and political oblivion. We will not let that happen.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He launched a strong attack on the banks, accusing them of being \"anti-business\" in the past.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our leading banks are often anti-business, especially anti-small business. They threw traditional relationship banking over the side and sold useless insurance and dodgy derivatives instead.</p> <p>Public anger at the greed and stupidity in this industry will continue for a long time. But I am looking forward to, and I want to work with the new generation of sensible bankers to support the real economy.</p> </blockquote> <p>He said that, without the Lib Dems, the Conservative would not have agreed to support the Vickers proposals to divide investment banking from retail banking.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He confirmed that the government would set up a British business bank.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am working with the chancellor to develop a new institution that will combine a billion pounds of new government capital with a larger private sector contribution. This will apply leverage through guarantees to support up to \u00a310bn of finance to small and mid-sized business \u2013 a significant portion of all the lending currently available.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the World at One just now, when asked if the \u00a31bn would be a one-off investment or an annual one, he said it would start as a one-off payment \"for the moment\".</p> <p>He would not say when it would launch, but said he hoped to get it operating quite quickly.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He attacked \"head bangers\" on the Tory right who wanted the government to allow no-fault dismissal.</strong> This was a reference to the so-called \"fire at will\" plan in the Beecroft report.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have seen off the \u2018head bangers\u2019 who want a hire and fire culture and seem to find sacking people an aphrodisiac: totally irrelevant in a country with flexible labour markets which have created over a million private sector jobs in the last two years.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He attacked Labour, saying that under Tony Blair it lost its soul.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Labour can still be a ruthless political machine. But it used to be a lot more than that. It once had a soul and new ideas. Then we had 13 years of rootless New Labour. A hard-earned reputation for economic competence disappeared under the rubble of collapsing banks. Their party\u2019s long-standing commitment to individual freedoms was buried in a graveyard of civil liberties. Principled foreign policy was laid to rest in Iraq. They have scarcely begun the long march back from there.</p> </blockquote> <p>What's interesting about this is that he was not dismissing the party in an unqualified way, and he seemed to express a desire for Labour to change.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He reaffirmed his call for a mansion tax.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I know some of you hanker after a Hollande-style assault on top incomes. But we know that very high marginal rates of income tax are counter-productive. If I were advising Monsieur Hollande, I would recommend a \u2018chateau tax\u2019 \u2013 for those of us who never even managed a dumbed-down GCSE in French, that means a \u2018mansion tax\u2019. Core Lib Dem policy. A first step to the proper taxation of wealth and land. It horrifies the Tory backwoodsmen, but it is popular and right.</p> </blockquote> <p>In his World at One interview, Cable told Martha Kearney that she would be \"surprised\" how many Conservatives had an open mind about the mansion tax idea. Asked about whether George Osborne would support it, Cable said that he still had \"some persuasion to do\" but that Osborne was \"an intelligent man who sees the pros and cons\".</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He mocked Andrew Mitchell, making a joke about being a pleb.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Now I don't know what Boris and Dave got up to in Eton. Perhaps a pillow fight got out of control in the dormitories. I have been told, however, that jokes about social class are not good for the unity of the coalition. But as a mere pleb, I couldn't resist it.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Cable paid tribute to Clegg's leadership.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One of our central aims as Liberal Democrats is to show that coalitions work. And Nick Clegg\u2019s major contribution as leader is to do just that. At a time of crisis, coalition government was and is still the only way forward \u2013 and it required considerable political courage from Nick to make it happen.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cable said Clegg's contribution \"is to do just that\", but the text released to journalists in advance was not quite so loyal. It quoted Cable as saying Clegg's contribution \"has been to do just that\".</p> <p>I've described the speech as the opening bid in the coalition negotiations for 2015. Of course, Cable also left open the question of who might be leading the Lib Dems in those negotiations. There was nothing disloyal in the speech, but it will have reminded Lib Dem delegates very effectively that, were Clegg to stand down, another candidate is available.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T13:44:07.834Z\">at 2.44pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5060555c58f9bdd2eeba0182\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T12:43:08.112Z\">1.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-21696a0e-00a7-48b3-b615-f8dd985d6c18\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/24/1348490570297/2dceb193-4485-4abc-85af-394d1e659f30-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Danny Alexander, Nick Clegg and other senior Liberal Democrats applaud Cable's speech\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Danny Alexander, Nick Clegg and other senior Liberal Democrats applaud Cable's speech.

There are two amendments, and although the first, proposed by Ed Randall and Linda Jack, looks relatively innocuous, it would knock four words out of the original one.

It\u2019s time to save Nick Clegg. I have just read the Sunday papers, and the anti-Clegg feeling rises off them like a sulphurous cloud. According to one reliable analyst, the ratings of the Lib Dem leader are currently standing at minus 62 per cent \u2013 lower than Osama bin Laden. Expert after expert steps forward to give the Deputy PM a kick in the pants, and the overwhelming view is that he should be defenestrated before the next election. He is not just toxic for the Libs, say these pundits \u2013 he is contaminating the entire Coalition. Some talk of Vince Cable replacing him, some of Ed Davey.</p> <p>So in the dwindling months we have available, it is time for us Clegg fans to echo those kindly folk who are trying to save the sweet furry badgers from the wrath of farmers. Never mind the badgers \u2013 save the Cleggster from extermination ...</p> <p>I have always thought that if you leave out Europe, he is probably a natural Tory.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/23/fantasy-role-liberal-democrat-conference\">\u2022 Jackie Ashley in the Guardian says that the Lib Dems are deluded about their impact on politics and that some Lib Dems want to change the leadership rules.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A group of defeated MPs and others are planning a motion for the Lib Dem gathering next spring to change the party rules in order to allow leaders to be ousted by the party conference. They'd be unlikely to get the necessary two-thirds majority, but a simple numerical one would be such a stinging rejection of Clegg that he would have to resign. Then, the argument goes, the party could find a different leader (probably Cable, as a stopgap) for the 2015 election, and save as many seats as possible.</p> <p>Usually, we're told that conference plots are fantasies, and we should concentrate on the policies. Well, this time round, it's the other way about. The new policy positions are airy dreams, but the skullduggery is both real and becoming a more practical proposition with every opinion poll.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/059e1dc4-059b-11e2-bce8-00144feabdc0.html#axzz27N9gxKGQ\">\u2022 The Financial Times (subscription) says that Danny Alexander will say today that the government should press ahead with the Dilnot plan to reform social care.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Danny Alexander will warn his Conservative colleagues on Monday not to delay plans to reform social care for the elderly and state pensions, amid Treasury fears that the changes would cost too much.</p> <p>The Treasury chief secretary plans to use a question-and-answer session at the Liberal Democrat conference in Brighton to insist that the government goes ahead with both the Dilnot reforms and a single-tier state pension, according to officials.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article3547528.ece\">\u2022 The Times (paywall) says political parties are increasing the amount of money they make from party conferences.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Profits from political conferences have rocketed despite party membership dropping to an all-time low, research by <em>The Times</em> has found.</p> <p>Lobbyists, corporate delegates and the media are increasingly taking the place of activists as public disillusionment with politics leads to a hollowing out of parties at grassroots level as well as to poor voter turnout.</p> <p>The change has led to complaints of conference \u201csterilisation\u201d, with the events becoming media showcases that allow no room for dissent. There are also fears that prospective MPs are being selected by an ever-decreasing number of people.

Labour introduced tuition fees and commissioned the Browne report, which would have recommended tuition fees with no upper limit.</p> <p>Clegg says in the future he thinks other parties will follow the Lib Dems in making a distinction between key priorities, ones that they will \"die in the ditch for\", and other policies.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T14:35:41.152Z\">at 3.35pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5060088e58f90bd4c3fd4ab2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T07:15:26.217Z\">8.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Nick Clegg</strong> is being interviewed on the Today programme now.

  "<p>Barack Obama will use his keynote speech to the United Nations on Tuesday to confront the violent unrest in the Muslim world in the wake of a US-made anti-Islamic video \u2013 and to insist he will not be deflected from support for the Arab spring.</p> <p>Amid attacks from Mitt Romney and the Republicans on Obama's Middle East record, the White House said the UN speech offered a chance for the president to address the issues raised by the unrest.</p> <p>\"It is a real moment for the US to assert its values and leadership in this period of transition,\" the White House spokesman, Jay Carney, said on Monday</p> <p>Carney insisted there would be no retreat by the US into isolationism, and that the Obama administration would continue to provide support for the emerging democracies in the Middle East.</p> <p>Looking for something positive amid recent criticism of the administration's handling of the unrest, he praised as \"remarkable\" the protests in Libya that had against Bengazhi militia groups blamed for the killing of US ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans almost two weeks ago.</p> <p>With the White House election only six weeks away, Obama has to balance the diplomatic need to send a message to the international community with the political need to address a growing clamour in the US over the unrest.</p> <p>Voters are becoming increasingly resentful over what they regard as ungrateful populations who receive US aid but then attack US embassies.</p> <p>Obama enjoys a large poll lead over his Republican opponent Mitt Romney on foreign policy, mainly as a result of the killing of Osama bin Laden, but Democrats fear that lead could be eroded if the current wave of Middle East protests continues into October.</p> <p>Carney said Obama would reiterate the sentiment that his administration distances itself from the anti-Muslim video produced in California but also deplores the violence that followed. The president \"will make it clear we reject the views in the video while saying violence is never acceptable\".</p> <p>In an interview with CBS 60 Minutes broadcast on Sunday, Obama characterised the violence as \"bumps on the road\" to democracy. Some Republicans accused him of being disrespectful by using this term to describe events that had claimed the lives of Stevens and the other Americans.</p> <p>Carney responded that the president was not referring to the deaths and that it was \"offensive\" to suggest otherwise.</p> <p>Obama was scheduled to attend a reception for world leaders in New York on Monday night before addressing the general assembly on Tuesday morning.</p> <p>He is being criticised by Republicans for failing to meet the Israeli leader Binyamin Netanyahu either in New York or Washington to discuss Iran's nuclear programme.</p> <p>The Republicans are portraying this as a snub to what they say is America's closest ally.</p> <p>Carney repeated, diplomatically, that it is a logistical problem, with Obama and Netanyahu in New York at different times. He added that Obama had spoken with leaders in the region frequently over the past month, particularly leaders from Egypt, Israel, Yemen and Turkey.</p> <p>No bilateral meetings with any leaders are planned, Carney said.</p> <p>Republicans have contrasted Obama's willingness to find time to appear on the daytime talk show The View while in New York on Monday with his failure to find time to meet one-on-one with other world leaders.</p> <p>Carney said that while no bilaterals are planned, the president would have \"encounters\" with other leaders at the reception on Monday night and at the UN building on Tuesday.</p> <p>Relations between Obama and Netanyahu have long been strained over Israel's continued expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and, more recently, Netanyahu's push to force Obama to agree red lines in the face-off with Iran.</p> <p>Obama has shown no signs of seeking a rapproachment with Netanyahu, even though the coolness between the two may cost him some Jewish votes and campaign donations.</p> <p>In his UN speech, Obama is to warn Iran that the window of opportunity for a diplomatic solution will not remain open indefinitely.</p> <p>The US, Israel, Britain and other European Union countries allege that Iran is close to achieving a nuclear weapons capability and insist they will not allow this to happen. Iran insists its programme is for provision of energy for civilians and is not intended to produce a nuclear bomb.</p>",
  "<p>Hillary Clinton strayed into presidential politics on Monday with a call for the global elite to pay more taxes, a day after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/23/bill-clinton-hillary-presidential-2016\">her husband re-ignited speculation she would seek the White House herself in 2016</a>.</p> <p>The barbed comments, made in a speech to the Clinton Global Initiative event, were widely seen as a dig at Mitt Romney. The Republican contender has been under attack \u2013 from Bill Clinton among others \u2013 for paying a relatively small portion of income tax despite his immense wealth.</p> <p>The secretary of state's remarks on taxing the rich were directed at developing countries, and they included a disclaimer. \"I am out of politics now,\" she said. But she said she had become increasingly convinced of the need for changes in tax structures around the world.</p> <p>\"One of the issues I have been preaching about around the world is collecting taxes in an equitable manner, especially from elites around the world,\" Clinton said. \"It is a fact that around the world the elites of every country are making money.</p> <p>\"There are rich people everywhere, and yet they do not contribute to their growth of their own countries.\"</p> <p>The remarks met with nods of recognition inside the room as a rebuke at Romney and earned a smattering of applause.</p> <p>It was hard to escape the parallels with comments made by Bill Clinton on CBS Face the Nation on Sunday \u2013 that it would be hard for America to dig itself out of the recession with low tax rates on the rich. The former president's remarks were seen as a reference to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/21/romney-releases-tax-return-summaries\">the release of Romney's 2011 tax return on Friday</a>, which showed the Republican candidate paid an effective tax rate of 14.1% on $13.7m in income.</p> <p>\"I don't think we can get out of this hole we're in if people at that income level only pay 13% or 14%,\" the former president said.</p> <p>The secretary of state, in her remarks, also called for the rich to do more.</p> <p>\"They don't invest in public schools and public hospitals and other kinds of development internally,\" she said. \"So it means for leaders telling powerful people things they don't want to hear. It means being transparent about budgets and revenues and bringing corruption to light.\"</p> <p>The similarity of such comments from a former president and a serving member of the Obama administration was striking \u2013 and reminiscent of Bill Clinton's comments many years ago that he and his wife were a double act. The Bill-Hillary show was in evidence on Sunday, when the former president re-ignited speculation that his wife would make another run for the White House in 2016, having failed to secure the Democratic nomination in 2008.</p> <p>Officially, the secretary of state plans to retire when she fills out her term. She has said that she does not want to serve in a second Obama administration, if the president is re-elected in November. She has spoken about taking time off after a grueling schedule, and about writing a memoir.</p> <p>In July, Clinton racked up more distance traveled than any other secretary of state, with more than 27,000 miles on the road. There have been more trips since then.</p> <p>Clinton also used her speech on Monday to deliver a message to protesters in the Middle East and north Africa that violent demonstrations would not improve their lives.</p> <p>\"If you look around the world today, countries that are focused more on fostering growth than fomenting grievance are racing ahead,\" she said. \"Building schools instead of burning them; investing in their people's creativity, not inciting their rage; opening their economies and societies to have more connections with the wider world, not shutting off the internet or attacking embassies.</p> <p>\"The people of the Arab world did not set out to trade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of a mob. There is no dignity in that.\" </p> <p>Despite such exertions as secretary of state, speculation that Clinton may have enough energy for another run for the White House continues. On Sunday her husband, in his appearance on CBS, failed to offer a denial that his wife still had political ambitious. </p> <p>\"I have no earthly idea what she will decide to do,\" the former president said. \"She wants to take some time off, kind of regroup. Write a book.\"</p> <p>By the time the secretary of state turned up for her rapturous welcome at the CGI on Monday morning, however, that was seeming less and less likely.</p>",
  "<p>Nick Clegg's apology has done little to redeem his party's reputation among students, according to an NUS survey of 25,000 students.</p> <p>Just one in 10 students (11.1%) say they are more likely to vote Lib Dem after the deputy prime minister said sorry for promising not to increase tuition fees before the last election.</p> <p>When asked which political party they would to vote for, one in 13 (7.7%) said they would back the Lib Dems, making them less popular than Labour (37.9%), Conservatives (16.8%) and the Green party (8.0%).</p> <p>NUS president Liam Burns was unsurprised by the findings, adding that students felt betrayed by Clegg's decision to renegade on his promise not to vote for a tuition fee rise. \"Nick Clegg actually won students' votes by signing the pledge. It is clear he has lost them by breaking it. This attempted apology has created more confusion than clarity. Mr Clegg must now make amends by changing his policies.\"</p> <p>In the runup to the 2010 general election the Lib Dems targeted university campuses with their campaign to abolish fees, while Clegg and his MPs signed the NUS pledge not to vote for a rise.</p> <p>Burns backed comments made Lib Dem party president Tim Farron that the party \"should have fought harder\" to keep its promise and called on Clegg to change his policies.</p> <p>\"He and those of his colleagues who voted for a rise in tuition fees should not be apologising for making a pledge which reinforced the Liberal Democrats long standing and fully costed proposal to abolish tuition fees.\"</p>",
  "<p>Those watching the Republican convention, or listening to campaign pitches by Governor Romney and Congressman Ryan, could hardly have missed the endless <a href=\"http://www.gop.com/our-party/\">glorification</a> of entrepreneurs. The <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2012/08/31/160370383/gops-we-built-it-refrain-is-both-puzzling-and-telling\">entrepreneur holds center-stage</a> in modern Republican folklore.</p> <p>No reasonable person can question the importance of entrepreneurs in our economy. We need them to create new businesses and jobs. Of course, we also need schoolteachers, firefighters, auto mechanics and custodians. The question is: do we necessarily need more entrepreneurs, and, if so, what policies should we pursue to persuade more people to start businesses?</p> <p>There is more than the usual amount of silliness around discussions of entrepreneurs and small businesses, and it infects both political parties. While it is easy to point to the Apples, Googles and other recent upstarts that have grown into large, successful companies, the vast majority of new businesses fail within their first decade of <a href=\"http://smallbiztrends.com/2008/04/startup-failure-rates.html\">existence</a>. At the most immediate level, more entrepreneurs means more failures. </p> <p>If we make it easier for people to become entrepreneurs, then we should expect many more failures. The failure rate of the people who are induced by new government policies to become entrepreneurs will almost certainly be even higher than the average for the current group of entrepreneurs. This could mean that we would be looking at a 10-year failure rate of 90% or higher among the people who are persuaded to start a business with our new, more entrepreneur-friendly policies. It is not obvious that this is good either for the economy or for the would-be entrepreneurs.</p> <p>Starting with the latter, the entrepreneur glorifiers tell us about people pursuing their dreams. Those starting new businesses often exhaust their savings, take out a second mortgage on a house, borrow to the limit on credit cards and hit up family and friends for the money needed to get their business off the ground. Many leave stable, well-paying jobs with promising career paths. They then work 70-, 80- or even 100-hour weeks. Sometimes, they can go years without a day of vacation or other leave, neglecting their friends, family and health in the process.</p> <p>When the end result is a thriving company that provides a good product or service, this is perhaps all worthwhile. But when the end result is a bankrupt company \u2013 which is more frequently the case \u2013 the equation doesn't look so good. Our entrepreneur may find him or herself in a situation where he or she is unemployed with no savings, and possibly has frayed relations with friends and family.</p> <p>They may not realise it, but those who think we should have more entrepreneurs want to see more people end up in this spot. That isn't their intention, but it is the inevitable result of more people starting new businesses. Starting a business may be many people's dream, but not every dream should be pursued. (How many boys grow up dreaming of being an NFL quarterback?) The reality is that many people are not very good at business and will fail no matter how hard they try.</p> <p>Even if additional entrepreneurship may prove to be bad news for the failures themselves, won't it help the economy? The glorifiers of entrepreneurship tell us that we need new businesses to create jobs and fuel productivity growth. According to one widely-cited study by <a href=\"http:/ /www.kauffman.org/research-and-policy/the-importance-of-startups-in-job-creation-and-job-desctruction.aspx\">the Kauffman Foundation</a>, nearly all the job growth over the last three decades came from new businesses, with the firms in existence as of 1977 making virtually no net gain in employment.</p> <p>This argument involves some unusually sloppy reasoning. Suppose we accept the study's conclusion, does it follow we need more new firms? What if we discovered that all the new jobs in the last three decades were in firms that were located west of the Mississippi? It doesn't follow that we would get more jobs in the future by taxing the firms located east of the Mississippi to subsidize those that are west of the river.</p> <p>In effect, this is what the boosters of entrepreneurism would have us do. They would like to have subsidies of various forms, whether it involves lower tax rates, subsidized credit or reduced regulatory oversight in order to make it easier for people to start new companies.</p> <p>While these policies may at first appear to be free lunches, all of them implicitly impose costs elsewhere. In the case of lower taxes, other businesses or individuals will have to make up for the reduced revenue. Lower-cost credit for new businesses, means higher-cost credit for others. And reduced regulatory scrutiny, for example in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Jumpstart_Our_Business_Startups_Act\">Jumpstart Our Businesses bill</a>, will make it easier for businesses to prey on ill-informed investors. By imposing higher costs on existing businesses and individuals, these measures will slow economic growth and job creation.</p> <p>When the capital obtained by ill-conceived business ventures is then wasted, it has the same impact on the economy as if the government had spent the same money on some hare-brained bureaucratic scheme. Anyone who remembers the internet boom of the late 1990s should understand how start-ups can <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jerry-jasinowski/creating-another-bubble_b_1883585.html\">waste money</a> and resources.</p> <p>In short, it's great that we have people who want to take the risks to become entrepreneurs. It is also great that we have people who are willing to work as teachers and custodians. The notion that more entrepreneurship is necessarily better does not pass the laugh test. The people pushing this line have not bothered to do the necessary homework to make a credible argument.</p>",
  "<p>The future of one of Iran's great political survivors, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, has been called into question after two of his children were taken to prison within three days of each other.</p> <p>The son and daughter of former Iranian president have been taken to Tehran's Evin prison and face separate anti-state allegations.</p> <p>Such a degree of pressure on a former president is unprecedented in the history of the Islamic republic, especially for Rafsanjani, who is believed to have played an instrumental role in the appointment of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as the supreme leader after the death in 1989 of the Islamic revolution's founder, Ayatollah Khomeini.</p> <p>Rafsanjani's son, Mehdi Hashemi, was detained on Monday after returning to Iran from a self-imposed exile and spending three years of studying in the UK.</p> <p>Local agencies reported that he was summoned for questioning a day after arriving back in Tehran and was later taken into custody after a warrant for his arrest was issued. \"Mehdi Hashemi was told about the accusations against him and later taken to jail,\" reported the semi-official Ilna news agency.</p> <p>He is believed to be held on accusations of having links to Iran's opposition Green movement and the popular unrest in the aftermath of the country's 2009 disputed presidential election.</p> <p>Rafsanjani's daughter, Faezeh Hashemi, a political activist and former Iranian MP, was taken to Evin on Saturday to serve a six-month prison term after being found guilty of \"spreading propaganda against the regime\".</p> <p>In January, Tehran's revolutionary court sentenced her on a conviction that is believed to be the result of an interview she gave to an opposition website, <a href=\"http://www.roozonline.com/english.html\" title=\"\">Roozonline</a>, in which she blamed regime supporters for harassing her in public. The former MP infuriated hardliners by publicly supporting the opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi in 2009 and participating in post-election protests against the vote's results.</p> <p>While in the UK, her brother made headlines over separate allegations that he was studying a five-year DPhil on Iran's constitution at Oxford University without meeting the English language criteria. The university, which investigated the allegations, backed the student although Mehdi Hashemi never attempted to appear in public and demonstrate his language skills.</p> <p>Last year, a Canadian court found him liable in absentia for imprisoning and torturing a rival in the 1990s, allegations he has categorically denied.</p> <p>In March that year, his father, under pressure from opponents, abandoned his position as the head of a powerful clerical body charged with appointing and dismissing the supreme leader.</p> <p>Rafsanjani presides over Iran's expediency council which mediates between the parliament and the guardian council, a body that vets all legislation.</p> <p>In the past, the 78-year-old moderate politician used to enjoy a great deal of influence and was seen as crucial for the survival of the regime because of his mediatory power. But his authority has diminished since he lost the 2005 presidential election to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.</p> <p>Pressure on Rafsanjani's family has grown since then. His other son, Mohsen Hashemi, resigned under pressure from Ahmadinejad's government as the head of Tehran's metro organisation in 2011.</p> <p>Rafsanjani's reputation was also damaged in the past decade by widespread allegations by regime and opposition supporters that he and his family were financially corrupt.</p> <p>\"Despite all the setbacks, Rafsanjani still has relatively good influence among supporters of the regime albeit not necessarily with those in power,\" said an Iranian analyst based in London who asked not to be named. \"As a moderate figure, he still can be considered as Iran's way out of the current stalemate with the international community, and that's why he might rise to power in no time if Khamenei decides to rely on him for the survival of the regime.\"</p> <p>Rafsanjani is also a moderate supporter of Iran's opposition Green movement and its leaders Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi, who are currently held under house arrest.</p>",
  "<p>The Mormon presidential candidate's social vision is a far cry from the communitarian ethos of early Mormonism. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/mittromney\" title=\"\">Mitt Romney's campaign</a> has been all about individualism \u2013 a Randian dream of unregulated markets and untrammelled self-interest. The theme of the Republican convention was a rebuff to President Obama's perfectly sensible comment that individual success always depends on common services and social foundations. \"We built it,\" the sign over the podium read \u2013 and by \"we\" the Republicans meant \"each one of us, all by himself\".</p> <p>Romney's message would not have resonated with his Mormon forebears. I live in Rochester, New York, only a few miles from the birthplace of Mormonism \u2013 the Hill Cumorah, where in 1827 Joseph Smith is said to have been given the golden tablets of the Book of Mormon, the sacred grove where he had a vision of God the father and of Jesus, and the house where he lived at the time.</p> <p>It's a small house. Smith's parents had moved to the frontier of western New York State from Vermont, hoping for richer soil and better luck. They found the first but not a great deal of the second. Most of the early Mormons were people like that: struggling artisans and farmers, seekers and souls adrift in a world where chaos and isolation were hard to stave off. The religious manias and utopian communities of this region \u2013 the \"Burnt-Over District\", historians call it \u2013 testify to the rootlessness, disorientation, and even terror of life on the fringes of the United States in the 1830s.</p> <p>Smith offered the Latter-day Saints something more than a new bible and the grand theme of the new world as the kingdom of God. He offered them a community. The Mormons first gathered in Kirtland, Ohio, where there was already a group of Christian communists, and after a failed attempt at settling in Missouri they struck out for Illinois. In a few years they had built a city of 12,000. After Smith was murdered in 1844 Brigham Young led them to a new promised land, the valley of the Great Salt Lake. And there he set about building an ideal society:</p> <blockquote> \"I have looked upon the community of Latter-day Saints in vision and beheld them organised as one great family of heaven, each person performing his several duties in his line of industry, working for the good of the whole more than for individual aggrandisement; and in this I have beheld the most beautiful order that the mind of man can contemplate, and the grandest results for the upbuilding of the kingdom of God and the spread of righteousness upon the earth\u2026 Why can we not live in this world?\" </blockquote> <p>Young and his brethren tried, and they achieved some real success. As Mormon historian Leonard Arrington wrote in his classic Great Basin Kingdom, the Saints established \"co-operative arrangements for migration, colonisation, construction, agriculture, mining, manufacturing, merchandising \u2013 and, in fact, for every realm of economic activity.\" By the 1870s a \"United Order\" movement sought to turn Mormon communities into self-sufficient co-operatives with all production in common hands.</p> <p>But little of this was to last. The expanding United States could hardly tolerate a Mormon state blocking the way to California. Mormon polygamy was viewed with outrage; Mormon resistance to the market was probably just as offensive. In the end, of course, the Saints had to give in. Polygamy was renounced and the church became merely a powerful religious institution. There was no longer a kingdom to build up. Social responsibility was now equated with serving the church and contributing to the support of co-religionists who had fallen on hard times. Many called it \"the great capitulation,\" and after it, in Arrington's words, \"Individualism, speculation, and inequality\u2013 once thought to be characteristics of Babylon \u2013 were woven into the fabric of Mormon life.\"</p> <p>It is a familiar story and maybe even an inevitable one. But it is sad and ironic that Brigham Young and his followers embraced and tried to realise an inspiring picture of a community where each worked for the good of each other \u2013 and that the first Mormon to have a real shot at the White House and the party that nominated him have a vision that is opposed to Young's in every imaginable way.</p>",
  "<p>Andrew Mitchell has the air of a character out of Tory central casting. With his clipped officer's accent and boyish looks, Mitchell would not look out of place next to Bertie Wooster in the Drones Club.</p> <p>Unlike PG Wodehouse's bumbling character, the Conservative chief whip is no lightweight, intellectually or politically. He amassed a fortune working as a director at the investment bank Lazard before the last election and played a central role in helping to detoxify the Tory brand in five years as shadow international development secretary.</p> <p>Mitchell, 56, does, however, have two character flaws. These explain why he ran into difficulty at the Downing Street security gates last Wednesday evening and why he is taking time to remove the cloud above him.</p> <p>While Mitchell can be immensely charming, he has a short temper, as the armed police officers found out when they declined to open the security gates to allow him to leave on his bike. He can also fix opponents with a withering look and has been known to make the odd caustic remark.</p> <p>Mitchell's qualities \u2013 charm, brains and a mischievous sense of humour \u2013 have served him well in his 20 years in parliament. But his flaws, including an ability to make enemies, mean there is no shortage of Tory MPs lapping up every moment of his battle with the police.</p> <p>His future seems secure for the moment, after David Cameron accepted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/24/andrew-mitchell-reiterates-apology-police\" title=\"\">Mitchell's apology on Monday</a> and his indirect denial that he described the police officers as \"plebs\". Nick Clegg mirrored the No 10 thinking when he said that the police officer in question had accepted Mitchell's apology.</p> <p>One joke doing the rounds \u2013 though not from Mitchell \u2013 is that he could not possibly have called the police \"plebs\" because that is not in the lexicon of those educated at his public school, Rugby, where the biggest insult was to call someone a \"Tanner\" \u2013 the pejorative term used by boarders to describe scholarship day boys.</p> <p>If the prime minister has the air of someone born to rule, Mitchell can trump him after being born to a line of rulers. He is the son of David Mitchell, who served as a minister under Margaret Thatcher, and is the fourth Mitchell to become an MP. The former president of the Cambridge Union has also served in the army, in the Royal Tank Regiment.</p> <p>Mitchell first gained a reputation as a stern disciplinarian at Rugby, where he earned the nickname Thrasher. Rugby is the alma mater of Flashman, the bully in Tom Brown's School Days. Contemporaries say Mitchell \"knew\" at school that he would be prime minister. He ran as a candidate in the mock elections in 1974 (the year of two general elections) and won.</p> <p>Mitchell is wrongly described as a rightwinger because he famously said he adored Margaret Thatcher. He in fact hails more from the patrician Tory school that holds that the elite needs to look after the less well-off. This explains why he threw himself so wholeheartedly into his role as shadow international development secretary when Michael Howard promoted him to the shadow cabinet after the 2005 election. Mitchell was one of the few Tories, along with Andrew Lansley, appointed to cabinet in the role they had shadowed under Howard.</p> <p>The right has always been suspicious of Mitchell after his role as a whip, under the watchful eye of his first political patron David Davis, during the EU/Maastricht rebellions in the 1990s. The Tory right blocked Mitchell when he tried to stand for the Cities of Westminster and London parliamentary seat after losing his Nottinghamshire seat in 1997. He eventually triumphed in the even safer seat of Sutton Coldfield in time for the 2001 general election.</p> <p>Mitchell quickly allied himself to Davis when he returned to parliament and he served as his campaign manager in the 2005 Tory leadership contest. But he made a smart investment as the Davis campaign stalled, inviting George Osborne, who was serving as Cameron's campaign manager, to dinner at his country house.</p> <p>The alliance served Mitchell well as he reformed, but did not cut, Britain's aid budget. When Cameron and Osborne decided the whips office needed a shakeup they turned to the man who had always dreamed of playing the role immortalised by the late Ian Richardson in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Cards\" title=\"\">House of Cards</a>.</p> <p>Mitchell does not make friendships just on the basis of calculation, because he has friends across the political divide. Geoff Hoon and Charlie Falconer are some of his oldest friends.</p>",
  "<p>The president of one of the most impoverished, corrupt and mineral-rich countries on Earth has insisted he can turn it into a stable democracy and economic powerhouse, declaring: \"I will be both the Mandela and the Obama of Guinea.\"</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian, Alpha Cond\u00e9 said Guinea had left behind half a century of military coups and despotic regimes and was on an \"irreversible\" march to democracy. He sought to assure investors that a country boasting the second biggest mining reserves in Africa and fifth biggest in the world, potentially worth $222bn (\u00a3137bn), was open for business.</p> <p>Cond\u00e9, 74, has enlisted Tony Blair and George Soros as advisers and was granted an audience with Obama at the White House.

I was hoping that this would lead to the presidency, as this would enable me to do so, but that wasn't the important part. The ideal of the conviction was what drove me. The outcome, I couldn't tell while I was in the struggle. It was sticking to my objective and my course.\"</p> <p>Today the sports stadium that witnessed the 2009 massacre appears unremarkable, with football-shirted students strolling by and a young trumpeter leading a band of musicians. But hot and humid Conakry is a capital city of dilapidated buildings, potholed roads and erratic power and water supplies. More than half of Guinea's population lives in poverty and 70% are illiterate. It ranks near the bottom of global corruption, development and governance indices.</p> <p>Last year, Cond\u00e9 himself was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/19/guinea-president-survives-assassination-attempt\" title=\"\">targeted by assassins</a> who fired a rocket-propelled grenade into his compound, killing a bodyguard and raising questions over whether civilian rule could last. \"It's been 50 years so change will require some time,\" he said. \"We believe it is irreversible but it will require time.</p> <p>\"One must understand that changing mentalities and changing mindsets are very difficult. The challenges are many and there are many obstacles to change: there were many who benefited from the former system and will therefore resist the change process that we believe is irreversible because the youth wants it. We are looking to the youth.\"</p> <p>The prospect of an end to the chaos has triggered a scramble for Guinea's vast mineral reserves. It is the world's largest producer of bauxite, used to make aluminium, and boasts vast iron ore deposits as well as diamonds, gold and uranium. Rio Tinto, Vale and the Aluminum Corporation of China (Chinalco) are among the mining giants competing fiercely.</p> <p>How to carve up the cake, and learn lessons from the past by ducking the \"resource curse\" that has wreaked poverty and conflict on many countries, was the central theme of the recent Guinea economic forum that included ministers, investors, the British ambassador, the World Bank, the IMF, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Oxford University economist Paul Collier.

We still have much to do in terms of anti-corruption but we feel we have reached some important milestones already.\"</p> <p>The president is also receiving support from Blair, whose charity the <a href=\"http://www.africagovernance.org\" title=\"\">Africa Governance Initiative</a> has deployed advisers to Conakry to help instil sound leadership and attract foreign investment. Blair's office has <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/tony-blair/9136126/Tony-Blair-expands-his-African-empire-into-mineral-rich-Guinea.html\" title=\"\">denied that he has any commercial interest in Guinea</a>.</p> <p>Cond\u00e9 said: \"Mr Blair is helping the country in capacity building. We are the first francophone country he has come into. He has learned from his experience at Downing Street that it is not enough for a leader to have a vision; the centre of power should also be concentrated around the leader so he can empower himself to bring about his vision.\"</p> <p>The president's vision is under scrutiny, however. A year ago three protesters were killed during clashes between police and demonstrators at a banned opposition rally. <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/guinea-urged-investigate-opposition-protest-deaths-2011-09-28\" title=\"\">Amnesty International warned</a>: \"It's deeply alarming that President Alpha Cond\u00e9 is resorting to exactly the same brutal methods as his predecessors.\"</p> <p>In July, Cond\u00e9's <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/08/us-guinea-mine-protest-idUSBRE8770VV20120808\" title=\"\">security forces clashed with villagers</a> demanding jobs in the village of Zogota, where Vale and the Israeli billionaire Beny Steinmetz's BSG Resources are jointly seeking to develop an iron ore mine. Local rights groups claimed five protesters were killed, while the government has launched an investigation.</p> <p>Cond\u00e9, who is bound by the constitution to serve no more than two terms, denies that he will join the African hall of infamy as a liberator turned tyrant. \"Maybe, unlike others, I took 50 years to get to power,\" he said. \"I'm not a young man any more, or a 30-year-old, so I've reached a stage of maturity.</p> <p>\"When I was in prison, tremendous support arose throughout Africa and I feel I have a challenge to show the youth who believed in me then that I can bring about a new leadership for Africa \u2013 a leadership based on good governance, the respect of democratic freedom. It's very important for me to live up to that expectation.\"</p> <p>Political opponents, however, accuse Cond\u00e9 of stoking ethnic tensions and excluding them from the new Guinea. Parliamentary elections have been delayed by wrangling.</p> <p>Cond\u00e9's centralisation of power has raised eyebrows abroad. <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/about/ousmane-diagana\" title=\"\">Ousmane Diagana</a>, the World Bank's country director, said: \"He delivered on economic reforms but I think on the political aspect he is relatively slow when we take into consideration the type of new consensus that needs to be built around governance based on stronger political institutions.</p> <p>\"I think they need to have a frank debate. Guineans need to be around the same table to discuss the political agenda and how it can actually support the economic transformation.\"</p> <p>Diagana added: \"We're hoping the president is the right person to do that given his background and trajectory, but the fact this conversation is not taking place between the opposition and the government in charge is worrying.\"</p> <p>The scale of the challenge facing Cond\u00e9, and Guinea, just two years into democracy is daunting. There was a timely reality check from Donald Kaberuka, the president of the <a href=\"http://www.afdb.org\" title=\"\">African Development Bank</a>. \"Guinea has wasted too much time,\" he told the forum. \"At the time when the rest of Africa is moving on, this is time for Guinea and Guineans to come together through strong political institutions, to come together through transparent economic governance. The hard work begins now.\"</p>",
  "<p>Three days after Ambassador Chris Stevens was killed in Benghazi, Libya, <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2012/09/22/world/africa/libya-ambassador-journal/index.html\">CNN found</a> a seven-page handwritten journal he had written. That journal, found on the floor of what CNN called \"the largely unsecured consulate compound where he was fatally wounded\", contained obviously newsworthy information: specifically that \"in the months leading up to his death, the late ambassador worried about what he called the security threats in Benghazi and a rise in Islamic extremism\". CNN <a href=\"http://security.blogs.cnn.com/2012/09/20/source-slain-ambassador-stevens-worried-about-security-threats-in-libya/\"> also reported</a> that Stevens \"mentioned his name was on an al Qaeda hit list\".</p> <p>After finding the journal, CNN personnel did the only thing which any minimally competent journalist would and should do: they read it, identified the parts that were in the public interest, confirmed their authenticity with independent sources, and then reported those facts to the world. They also notified Stevens' family of what they had found.</p> <p>In response to this reporting, State Department spokesman Philippe Reines issued <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/22/cnn-christopher-stevens-journal-state-dept-response_n_1906609.html\">a blistering, unusually aggressive attack</a> on the news network. Denouncing CNN's conduct as \"disgusting\", Reines invoked Stevens' family to insist that CNN had done something unconscionable:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"What they're not owning up to is reading and transcribing Chris's diary well before bothering to tell the family or anyone else that they took it from the site of the attack. Or that when they finally did tell them, they completely ignored the wishes of the family, and ultimately broke their pledge made to them only hours after they witnessed the return to the United States of Chris's remains.</p> <p>\"Whose first instinct is to remove from a crime scene the diary of a man killed along with three other Americans serving our country, read it, transcribe it, email it around your newsroom for others to read, and only when their curiosity is fully satisfied thinks to call the family or notify the authorities?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The answer to that question is: any journalist worthy of the name. CNN's first obligation is to disclose to the public information that is newsworthy, not conceal it. Had they not reported this information, that would have been an inexcusable breach of their obligation - <em>then</em> the word \"disgusting\" would have been appropriate. What they reported had nothing to do with Stevens' personal life and everything to do with his role as a government official; his family's \"permission\" was therefore irrelevant.</p> <p>(At least a few Democratic Party loyalists have dutifully joined in the State Department's attack on CNN. One of Nancy Pelosi's daughters, Christine - yet another in the <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/11/14/americas_meritocratic_watchdog_news_media/\">endless stream of televised pundits</a> who is given a public platform due to a politically famous parent in a nation that claims to loathe aristocracy - <a href=\"http://johnnydollar.us/files/120922geraldo.php\">went on Fox News this weekend and denounced CNN</a> as \"outrageous\" and demanded that \"they absolutely ought to be stopped\", whatever that might mean.)</p> <p>What is actually \"disgusting\" here is that the State Department is exploiting the grief of Chris Stevens' family in an attempt to suppress and delegitimize reporting that reflects quite poorly on them. As Michael Hastings <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/mhastings/libya-threatens-clintons-legacy-and-stat\">documented yesterday</a>, the State Department views the revelations from Stevens' journal as threatening to Hillary Clinton's reputation, the legacy of the war in Libya, and possibly Obama's political prospects in an election year:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The blockbuster news contradicted the line the State Department and the administration had been pushing since the horrible tragedy took place almost two weeks ago: that there was no intelligence of a coming attack. In fact, the Ambassador himself was aware of a persistent high level threat against him.</p> <p>\"'Perhaps the real question here,' CNN responded to the State Department criticism, 'Is why is the State Department now attacking the messenger.'</p> <p>\"That is the real question, and State Department's bizarre criticism of CNN gives clues to the answer. Foggy Bottom is now in full-on damage control mode, with the primary goal of keeping Hillary Clinton's legacy in Libya - and in Washington - intact.</p> <p>\"The election-year focus on President Barack Obama meant that the White House had at first been catching most of the heat for the tragedy in Benghazi. It's certainly true the explanations from White House spokesman Jay Carney and UN Ambassador Susan Rice have strained common sense - mainly, the idea that the attack could be blamed solely on an anti-Islamic video, and that there was a protest outside the consulate at 10 p.m. (there reportedly wasn't,) among other misleading details. That initial story has crumbled . . . </p> <p>\"But in reality, the fiasco appears to be largely - if not entirely - a State Department botch. It was the State Department that failed to provide its ambassador adequate security; it was the State Department that fled Benghazi in the aftermath of the attack, apparently failing to clear or secure the scene, leaving Stevens' diary behind; and it was State that had taken the lead on the ground after the Libya intervention.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>I'm not particularly impressed with the criticism that the Obama administration should have better secured the consulate. It is always easy retroactively to demand greater security when an attack occurs, and it is impossible to safeguard against all potential threats. Nonetheless, that is a criticism that is being widely voiced, rendering Stevens' journal clearly relevant and newsworthy. If a US ambassador is murdered, the fact that he spent months worrying about his security is obviously something the public should know.</p> <p>But the more relevant impact is how this reflects on the war in Libya, flamboyantly celebrated as a grand success by Washington consensus and then all but forgotten. Stevens' journal is but the latest in a long line of evidence demonstrating how much extreme instability, lawlessness and violence is <a href=\"http://www.amnestyusa.org/research/reports/libya-rule-of-law-or-rule-of-militias\">plaguing that country</a> in the aftermath of the intervention. Wrote Hastings: \"As one senior U.S. government official who'd visited Libya told me earlier this summer: 'It's not Iraq, but it's not good, either.'\"</p> <p>Along those lines, the New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/24/world/africa/attack-in-libya-was-major-blow-to-cia-efforts.html?hp\">reported today</a> that the killing of Stevens and the evacuation of all Americans from Benghazi both exposed and disrupted a far larger CIA contingent (\"operatives and contractors\") in the city than was previously known - even by Libya's supposedly sovereign government. That the US exploited its \"humanitarian intervention\" to establish a substantial covert CIA beachhead is the opposite of surprising. Those operatives, among other things, worked on \"tracking shoulder-fired missiles taken from the former arsenals of\" Gadaffis' forces and \"aided in efforts to secure Libya's chemical weapons stockpiles\".</p> <p>Yet again, western military intervention spawns vast instability and leads to the proliferation of weapons into the hands of extremists deeply hostile to the US. As Jonathan Schwarz, referring to the US support of the pre-Al-Qaeda mujahdeen in Afghanistan, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tinyrevolution/status/245893850340671488\">sardonically noted</a> in the aftermath of the 11 September Benghazi attack: \"with practice and better technology, we've really cut down the turnaround time between arming Islamists and them killing Americans on 9/11.\"</p> <p>We see this over and over and yet never learn the lesson. The New York Times editorial page today <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/24/opinion/on-the-wrong-side.html?hp\">declared the Iraqi government</a> \"on the wrong side\" by virtue of its alignment with Iran and Syria and suggested that US aid - only a fraction of what is necessary to rebuild that country after the US destroyed it - should be cut off if such insolence continues. US-enabled regime change, time and again, exacerbates the very problems it is ostensibly intended to resolve. </p> <p>If the Iraqi government continues to side with Iran, how much longer will it be before calls for regime change in Iraq are renewed? And how much longer will it be before we hear that <a href=\"http://www.chron.com/news/nation-world/article/US-sends-Marines-to-Libya-after-deadly-attack-3860770.php\">military intervention in Libya</a> is (again) necessary, this time to control the anti-US extremists who are now armed and empowered by virtue of the first intervention? US military interventions are most adept at ensuring that future US military interventions will always be necessary.</p> <p>It is no wonder, then, that the State Department is so infuriated that CNN reported the serious concerns expressed by Ambassador Stevens. Those journal entries further impugn the US government's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/20/obama-officials-spin-benghazi-attack\">now discredited story</a> about the Benghazi attack, and further underscore the profound instability and danger in Libya in the wake of that intervention. Feigned concerns over the sensitivities of the Stevens family notwithstanding, that is exactly why the Obama administration and its loyalists are so incensed by CNN's reporting, and it is exactly why CNN had not only the right, but also the duty, to report this.</p>",

So the question becomes, and this will be the central battleground for the next general election, is if you're going to have to make more savings, having made all these controversial ones already, who pays.\"</p> <p>He added: \"I am establishing quite simply that you start at the top and work down, you don't start at the bottom and ask the poorest to pay for the mistakes of the bankers.\"</p> <p>Clegg said that while his party's \"lead suggestion\" was a wealth tax on homes of \u00a32m or above, there were \"numerous other ways\" in which the wealthy could contribute more.</p> <p>Although the government had already asked for contributions from top earners, through capital gains tax, clamping down on tax avoidance and increasing stamp duty, he said he wanted to ensure that \"further significant belt-tightening\" was done as fairly as possible.</p> <p>Pressed on the fact that the top 10% included people on five-figure salaries, Clegg said: \"The vast majority of people \u2013 90% of the people in the country \u2013 would think a salary of \u00a360,000, \u00a370,000, \u00a380,000 is a considerable amount of money.\"</p> <p>He added: \"What I am saying is that there is a big dividing line in British politics between people who when faced with the prospect of having to make more savings, immediately reach to ask for the poorest to make more sacrifices.</p> <p>\"I am saying we cannot of course make the budget somehow immune to further savings, but we've got to ask people who are far better off to make a contribution. And my experience is that decent, fair-minded folk who are earning far, far more than the national average understand they that they do need to make a fair contribution because that's what the nation demands right now.\"</p> <p>Clegg was also quizzed on the public apology he made last week for making a pledge over tuition fees that the party subsequently broke when it joined the coalition government.</p> <p>He reiterated it had been wrong of the Live Dems to make a pledge saying they would vote against tuition fee increases in any circumstances. But he added that it had not been the party's flagship policy.</p> <p>The Lib Dems' four priorities \u2013 raising the personal tax allowance, the pupil premium, reforming banking and political reform \u2013 had been placed on the front page of their manifesto, he said, predicting that other parties would follow in making a distinction between key priorities, ones that they will \"die in the ditch for\", and other policies that will be \"subject to circumstances and resources and so on\".</p>",
  "<p>Life imitating art is an occupational hazard for BBC2's political satire The Thick of It. Ed Miliband's lifting of Malcolm Tucker's phrase \"omnishambles\" to describe the coalition government even crossed the Atlantic, when Mitt Romney's suggestion Britain might not be ready for the Olympics saw his visit to London collapse into a \"Romneyshambles\".&#xa0; \"It feels more like they copy us,\" star and co-writer Will Smith <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/aug/22/the-thick-of-it-politicians\">has said</a>.&#xa0; </p> <p>So viewers of the programme may not have been surprised by a slight feeling of deja vu today when they heard about <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/24/vince-cable-small-business-bank1\">Vince Cable's announcement of \u00a31bn to establish a British business bank to help small- and medium-sized enterprises</a>.</p> <p>Saturday's episode of The Thick of It saw the show's Lib Dem surrogates - junior minister Fergus and his adviser Adam - bumble their way into accidentally agreeing to a pretty young female economist's proposal of a \u00a32bn micro-bank to \"set up a network of micro-credit lenders at neighbourhood level\" to help businesses such as \"sisters who want to set up a pop-up baker's in a disused travel agents\". Cable's bank is not quite as hip as that, helping only \"the manufacturers, exporters and high-growth companies that power our economy\", and while The Thick of It's bank is funded by a Robin Hood tax which will&#xa0; \"steal from the fat cats and raise enough seed capital for hundreds of start-up funds for fledgling businesses\", the business secretary's will be paid for by \"underspends\" in Whitehall departments.</p> <p>Nevertheless, although Cable is unlikely to echo Adam's verdict that the idea is \"so fucking us it's brilliant\" when he addresses the Lib Dem conference today, he could do a lot worse than copy Fergus's description of the bank as \"a helping hand for hands-on people - making sure the can-doers don't get canned.\"</p> <p>George Osborne's reaction when Cable presented him with the proposal is not known. But The Thick of It's Tory minister Peter Mannion, appalled by the price tag, is reassured by his coalition partners that \"you don't need to shit yourself about it, because we're not buying it, all right - it's funded by taxes!\"</p> <p>Perhaps if the Lib Dems had tried out this argument in 2010 they wouldn't be in all this trouble about tuition fees.</p> <h2>Businesses they will target</h2> <p>The Thick of It: \"Sisters who want to set up a pop-up baker's in a disused travel agents.\"</p> <p>Vince Cable: \"The manufacturers, exporters and high-growth companies that power our economy.\"</p> <h2>Funding</h2> <p>The Thick of It: \"A Robin Hood tax: steal from the fat cats and raise enough seed capital for hundreds of start-up funds for fledgling businesses.\" </p> <p>Vince Cable: \"Underspends\" in Whitehall departments will provide \"a billion pounds of new government capital with a larger private sector contribution\".</p> <h2>Lib Dem view of the bank</h2> <p>The Thick of It: \"This is terrific. It's so fucking us it's brilliant \u2026 A helping hand for hands-on people - making sure the can-doers don't get canned.\"</p> <p>Cable: \"This is no time for the state to be stepping back. We need a new British business bank with a clean balance sheet and an ability to expand lending rapidly \u2026 Today I can announce we will have one.\"</p> <h2>Lib Dem message to the Tories</h2> <p>The Thick of It: \"You don't need to shit yourself about it, because we're not buying it, all right - it's funded by taxes!\"</p> <p>Cable: \"I have great sympathy with the chancellor, who is being attacked for borrowing too much and borrowing too little at the same time \u2026 \"</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama has defended his handling of the Middle East against criticism from Mitt Romney, saying pointedly that if the Republican presidential candidate wanted to start another war in the region, he should just come out and say it.</p> <p>Romney accused the president of failing to adopt a more aggressive stance towards ousting Bashar al-Assad from Syria, and claimed Obama's weak leadership elsewhere in the region had opened the way for the riots that led to the death of US ambassador Chris Stevens in Libya and three other Americans.</p> <p>Romney also attacked Obama for failing to offer enough support to Israel, particularly in relation to Iran.</p> <p>But Obama brushed aside the criticism. \"If Governor Romney is suggesting that we should start another war, he should say so,\" Obama said.</p> <p>The clash over foreign policy came in separate interviews with Obama and Romney by the CBS 60 Minutes show, broadcast on Sunday night. The exchanges gave the first indication of lines the pair may adopt in the presidential debates, the first of which is in Denver on 3 October.</p> <p>The Middle East is growing as a campaign issue, with many voters angry over the attacks on the US embassies. Romney is attempting to undercut Obama in an area, foreign policy, in which polls have consistently shown the president enjoys a considerable advantage.</p> <p>There is little public appetite for US involvement in another war after the one in Libya, in which France and Britain were portrayed as taking a lead, though backed by US logistical support. Obama has been careful to avoid the US being drawn into Syria and has refused to agree to Israeli demands that it set \"red lines\" on Iran's nuclear programme, which if crossed would trigger military strikes.</p> <p>In his interview, Romney criticised Obama for his failure to meet Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu either in New York this week when both will be at the United Nations or in Washington. He said this sent a message that the US was distancing itself from its friends.</p> <p>\"I think we also have to communicate that Israel is our ally. Our close ally. The president's decision not to meet with Bibi Netanyahu, prime minister of Israel, when the prime minister is here for the United Nations session I think is a mistake and sends a message throughout the Middle East that somehow we distance ourselves from our friends and I think the exact opposite approach is what's necessary,\" Romney said.</p> <p>Obama said he would not be pressured into making decisions. \"When it comes to our national security decisions, any pressure that I feel is simply to do what's right for the American people. And I am going to block out any noise that's out there,\" he said. But, he stressed that he felt an \"obligation, to make sure that we're in close consultation with the Israelis on these issues. Because it affects them deeply.\"</p> <p>Both men were asked about their biggest vulnerabilities. Obama said his was the failure to change the tone in Washington, a key promise from his 2008 campaign. </p> <p>He said: \"I'm the first one to confess that \u2013 the spirit that I brought to Washington, that I wanted to see instituted, where we weren't constantly in a political slugfest but were focused more on problem solving that \u2026 I haven't fully accomplished that.</p> <p>\"Haven't even come close in some cases. And \u2026 if you ask me, what's my biggest disappointment is that we haven't changed the tone in Washington as much as I would have liked.\"</p> <p>The admission echoes a similar remark he made less than a week ago in an interview with Hispanic television network Univision when he said he had been unable to change Washington from the inside as he said the lack of immigration reform had been his biggest failure. The remark was pounced upon by Romney and the Republican campaign. </p> <p>In his 60 Minutes interview, Romney was pressed on his tax reform plans but, as in past months, refused to go into detail. He said he would lower all income tax by 20% and would end many tax loopholes.</p> <p>\"The devil's in the details. The angel is in the policy, which is creating more jobs,\" Romney said.</p> <p>Because the tax cuts were being combined with an end to exemptions and deductions, most Americans would see little change in their tax payments. Working-class people would probably see as \"little break\".</p> <p>Romney, who released some of his of personal tax details on Friday, defended the fact that he paid less than 15% in tax because on investment income. \"I think it's the right way to encourage economic growth \u2014 to get people to invest, to start businesses, to put people to work,\" he said.</p> <p>Obama criticised Romney for having pursuing the same kind of tax policies as George W. Bush: tax cuts for the wealthy and rolling back regulations of the financial sector. \"Well, we tried that vigorously, between 2001 and 2008 and it didn't work out so well,\" Obama said.</p> <p>Romney also brushed aside the suggestion that his campaign was in difficulty. His team has been repeatedly forced on the defensive, unable to gets its message out. Last week was dominated by reports of internal strife and a devastating secret video of a Romney speech dismissive of 47% of Americans as freeloaders.</p> <p>But asked how he planned to turn things around, Romney said: \"Well, it doesn't need a turnaround.\" He added: \"I've got a very effective campaign. It's doing a very good job.\"</p>"
