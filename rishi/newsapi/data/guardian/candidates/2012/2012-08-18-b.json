We need the catchment above the town to be managed so that large areas of degraded blanket bog are restored to a healthy state, with sphagnum moss acting as a sponge in heavy rainfall, slowing the rate of run-off from the moorland tops that drains into Hebden Water.</p> <p>This river flooded badly at the end of June, inundating a street full of shops. The degradation is due primarily to the activities of grouse-shooting estates. On Walshaw Moor, we have seen erosion from unconsented tracks, very extensive drainage and aggressive burning on blanket bog. The increased scale of this activity over the past few years may well have been a contributory factor to the severity of the floods in our town.</p> <p><strong>Keith Wilson, Gareth Babb, Hannah Lewis, Mike Hill</strong>, <strong>Ute &amp; Rhys Kelly, Jill Chadwick, Myra James, Paul Cotton, Sarah Cotton, Joe Cotton, Sol Cotton, Chris Greaves, Rosie Foster, Penny Eastwood, Samantha Lowi, Eddy Beesley, Victoria Macdonald, Catherine Willis, Pete Keal, Gary Weatherhead, Mic Stocks, Duncan Smethurst, Tom Greenwood, Gordon Rimer, John Filby, B Reynolds, J Lord, George Forsythe, Paul and Jane Owens, Nid Jockson-Owens, Conor Lawrence, Jem Tattersall, Tom Flaxman Hardy, Liz Ainsworth, Fergus Wilson, Scott Sunderland, K Baker, Lucy Tatam, Mark Dean, Claire Kidd, Samantha Low, Jen Deacon, Adele Avison, Alex Rudkin, David Boardman, Lili Hutt, Dylan and Jacqeuline Rattray, Chris Marsden, Rebecca Ault , Mark Sharman, Kate Flaxman, Raymond Humphries, Lorraine and Phil Rodda, Peter Owen, M and C Wilson, M Horne, A Travis, D Hirst, Jools Hirst </strong></p> <h2><strong>Military get priorities right</strong></h2> <p>It was both reassuring and disquieting to read that the military are briefing themselves on the most serious problem facing this, and every other, country \u2013 the probable consequences of climate change coupled with massive overpopulation (\"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/12/robin-mckie-climate-change-dangers?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">How theatre delivered a dramatic warning about the planet's future</a>\", Comment).

  "<p>First the New York Times reports on the new trend of proposing marriage by flash mob, then Times reporter David Pogue creates a <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/47668788\">fake movie trailer</a> of the story of his love, persuades a local movie theater to play it, and videos his girlfriend watching it before tweeting it. (Spoiler alert: she says yes.) </p> <p>Proposing marriage used to be a time for quiet dignity between two people. No more. Now we live in a time of loud, instant reaction. A time to let the bells ring out all over the internet, to get down on one knee with tweet in hand. Make sure the live feed is up and running. Enlist everyone you know to pop the question with you. If they can't be there in person, have them Skype in like <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/5915338/is-this-the-most-epic-marriage-proposal-in-history-i-dont-really-know-but-i-would-say-yes\">Portland actor Isaac Lamb</a> did.</p> <p>So how can you fit in with or even outdo this trend? Here are some ideas:</p> <p>1. Book yourself in for open-heart surgery. Have your girlfriend be at the hospital. make sure the surgical camera is hooked up to Vimeo or YouTube. Just before they put you out, sit up on the gurney and tell your lady love only she can save your heart. If she says yes, cancel surgery and go home. If not, ask for extra anesthetic.</p> <p>2. Declare yourself a candidate for US president. Get nominated by your party. Win the election. At your swearing in, take the bible from the US chief justice of the supreme court and lip sync to Celine Dion's Power of Love while kneeling in front of your intended.</p> <p>3. Go with your partner to the Ecuadorian embassy in London. Propose.</p> <p>4. Train for the 10,000m track event at the Rio Olympics. Win the gold medal. Instead of grabbing the flag of your country, take a specially prepared banner that says \"Will you marry me Fill-in-the-name?\" Find your intended in the crowd. With any luck she will be seated several rows back. Trample over as many people as you can and breathlessly pop the question. Give live interviews to networks from all over the planet.</p> <p>5. Put on a brightly colored balaclava and find an electric guitar. Go to a large cathedral. Try not to get arrested.</p> <p>8. Become an anchor on the Today Show. Have no affect on the ratings. When Matt sadly tells you you're moving on, say \"Damn right!\" and burst into any song by Billy Ocean.</p> <p>7. Buy lots of Facebook shares. Record yourself giving them to your intended while reciting Matthew Arnold's Growing Old. Be prepared for disappointment.</p>",
  "<p>Republican vice presidential pick Paul Ryan sought to reassure Floridians over his controversial plans for senior healthcare on Saturday, relying on his 78-year-old mother to lend a hand.</p> <p>\"Mom\" Betty was introduced to a cheering partisan crowd at The Villages, a gated retirement cluster in the state, as her son looked to counter claims that his budget proposals would see America's cherished Medicare provisions turned into a stripped-down voucher system.</p> <p>Going on the offensive over the issue, Mitt Romney's running mate said President Obama's healthcare reforms would see \"one in six\" hospitals go out of business and force 4 million seniors to lose their current Medicare advantage plans, which are provided by private insurers.</p> <p>Moreover, a Romney-Ryan administration would not allow a \"board of bureaucrats\" to \"mess with my mom's healthcare, or your mom's healthcare\", the VP hopeful said.</p> <p>His comments got a parental nod of approval from Betty, who sat beside him as he campaigned in Florida, a key swing state.</p> <p>\"My mom is a snowbird ... she comes down here or the winter just like so many families around the country,\" Ryan added in a further bid to win over an already partisan crowd.</p> <p>The speech came a week after the Wisconsin House representative was named as a surprise pick by Romney as his White House running mate.</p> <p>That decision put the focus back on Ryan's controversial budget-slashing proposals, which Democrats say would gut healthcare provisions for older citizens.</p> <p>It has resulted in a push by the Republican White House ticket to mount a defence of their deficit reduction plan and healthcare blueprint. Polling has consistently shown that voters trust Democrats more than the GOP on the issue of Medicare \u2013 a much cherished safety net for seniors.</p> <p>Florida has the highest concentration of citizens aged 65 and over in the country \u2013 some 17% of the state's population fall into that group. Hence, the decision to use mom Betty as a prop while on the stump.</p> <p>The Ryan matriarch spends part of her year in the state, and has been a registered Florida voter since 1997.</p> <p>Having endeared himself to seniors at The Village, he turned to the broader election campaign, the economy, and attacks on the president.</p> <p>\"It is clear that President Obama inherited a difficult situation, the problem is he made matters worse,\" he said, adding, \"This is why the president has run out of ideas, this is why the president isn't running on hope and change anymore.</p> <p>\"He is running on anger and frustration, fear and smear. We are not going to do that.\"</p> <p>The reference to \"smears\" likely relates to ongoing pressure by Obama's campaign team on the issue of Romney's personal tax returns.</p> <p>Under the belief that the Republican candidate may be hiding something that could damage him in the eyes of voters, Democrats have demanded that Romney release at least five years' worth of returns.</p> <p>So far, Romney has doggedly refused to do so.</p>",
  "<p>President Barack Obama has called on Congress to release billions of dollars in funds to counter the damaging impact of teacher layoffs on America's education system.</p> <p>A report released Saturday by the White House found that more than 300,000 teaching positions had been lost since the end of the recession in 2009, resulting in a 4.6% bump in student-to-teacher ratios.</p> <p>In his weekly address, Obama struck out at obstructionists in Congress for blocking provisions that would support states in preventing further job cuts and help them rehire out-of-work teachers.</p> <p>He also took a swipe at Republicans for putting forward a budget that he claimed would further impact teacher numbers.</p> <p>The president said the financial blueprint put forward by his opponents would lead to \"fewer teachers in the classroom, and fewer college students with access to financial aid, all to pay for a massive new tax cut for millionaires and billionaires\".</p> <p>\"That's backwards, that's wrong. That plan doesn't invest in our future, it undercuts our future.\"</p> <p>The White House claimed that the proposed Republican budget could strip close to $3bn from education grants.</p> <p>They contrast this with the president's job plan that was put forward a year ago, but has only been passed in part.</p> <p>That employment blueprint includes provisions for some $25bn in educational aid. The money is needed, the administration says, to prevent further teacher layoffs.</p> <p>According to the report released Saturday, average class sizes have climbed as a result of an uptick in student-to-teacher rations from a low of 15.3 to one in 2008 to 16 to one in 2010.</p> <p>\"If we want America to lead in the 21st century, nothing is more important than giving everyone the best education possible \u2013 from the day they start preschool to the day they start their career,\" Obama said in his radio address.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in the weekly Republican address, House representative Vicky Hartzler attacked Democrats for failing to restore disaster programmes for farmers in the mid-west suffering from the worst drought in a generation.</p> <p>The upper house refused to carry the legislation before breaking for the summer, citing that Republicans in the House had stripped from the bill provisions related to the extension of food stamps.</p> <p>\"A lot was riding on this bill, but the Senate \u2013 a body controlled by the president's party \u2013 left Washington for the month of August without bringing it to a vote,\" the Missouri politician said.</p>",
  "<p>They are calling it the \"Mormon moment\". As Mitt Romney, a former Mormon bishop as well as a former governor of Massachusetts, runs for the White House, the transformation of Mormonism from persecuted and obscure frontier faith to significant world religion seems complete.</p> <p>If Romney were to become president of the United States it would turn a practising and devout Mormon into the most powerful man in the world. The mere fact of his nomination run in the Republican party has already shone an intense media spotlight on the faith and its spiritual home amid the valleys and high desert mountains of Utah.</p> <p>That spotlight is uncovering a complex set of sensitivities and affiliations. Many Mormons, while welcoming a chance to spread their beliefs, are deeply nervous about all the attention. Their faith, founded in the 1830s in upstate New York, was, after all, forced west by persecution and hatred.</p> <p>\"I am torn. I love that people are talking about my religion,\" said Craig Janis, a young Mormon professional sitting in a trendy coffee shop in downtown Salt Lake City. \"That's good for the church. But a lot of Mormons can be very defensive. There is a persecution complex.\"</p> <p>Whatever the wishes of some, there is no stopping the conversation now. Mormonism is one of the world's fastest growing religions and now has 14.4&#xa0;million members. It requires young members to serve abroad, giving it a 55,000-strong worldwide missionary force at any one time.</p> <p>With its headquarters in Salt Lake City, Mormonism is rapidly becoming part of the US mainstream. Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid is a Mormon. So is rightwing firebrand Glenn Beck. The main hit show on Broadway is <em>The Book of Mormon</em>. In some ways, a Romney presidency would just be the cherry on the cake. Many compare it to John F Kennedy's 1960 presidential win, which marked a breakthrough for Roman Catholics.</p> <p>For Janis, however, that would not be a welcome development. The young lawyer and technology entrepreneur does not want to see a Romney presidency. Defying the stereotype of Mormons as a politically homogenous group , Janis is both a practising Mormon and a fervent Democrat. He has no time for Romney. \"He bends so far to the right,\" Janis said.</p> <p>Nor is Janis alone. Mormonism generally, with its keen focus on the family, is a Republican stronghold: one recent survey showed 74% of Mormons are Republican-leaning. But it is not a straightforward issue. \"You are going to get a much higher percentage of black Americans voting for Barack Obama than you will Mormons voting for Romney,\" said Jeremy Lott, editor of the website Real Clear Religion.</p> <p>In Utah last year, a state organisation was formed called LDS Democrats \u2013 the LDS referring to the faith's full name, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints \u2013 and it has grown to 2,000 members. This year they will for the first time travel to the Democratic party's national convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, where Obama will be nominated for re-election.</p> <p>Members of the LDS Democrats are a broad political church. Social issues such as abortion and gay marriage are part of the debate, but opposing them is not the disqualifier that it might be in more liberal parts of America.</p> <p>\"We want people who are socially conservative and who are socially liberal,\" said LDS Democrats' vice-chair Crystal Young-Otterstrom. With her young daughter on her lap, she laughed as she described the group's mission in the heart of Mormon country: \"We are making converts, so to speak.\"</p> <p>Democratic Mormons like Janis and Young-Otterstrom are as religious as their Republican counterparts. But they have drawn a different lesson from Mormonism's past and theology.</p> <p>They look at its history of persecution \u2013 inspired largely by its early members' embracing of polygamy \u2013 and its long, hard trek across the continent. In the settlement and cultivation of the hard desert soil of Utah into a flourishing state, they see the triumph of communal values. In the bustling modern metropolis of Salt Lake City, and its many quiet, prosperous suburbs, they see the fulfilment of Democratic values. After all it is a Mormon's religious duty to relieve poverty.</p> <p>\"It is a misnomer to believe that this valley was settled with rugged individualism,\" said Steve Olsen, a former Mormon bishop, like Romney, and author of a book aimed at Mormons, <em>Why You May Be a Liberal (And That's Okay)</em>. \"It was settled with community spirit, unselfishness and people working together.\"</p> <p>Of course, other Mormons disagree. Rather than opposing Romney from the left, they attack him from the right. Examining the same Mormon history and theology, some see Mormonism as a natural home for conservative libertarianism. The one thing these groups agree on is that Romney would be a disaster. \"I think Obama is driving this country off a cliff at 100 mph. Romney would slow us down to maybe 95,\" said Connor Boyack, who recently founded his own libertarian thinktank in Utah. He too has a book out, <em>Latter Day Liberty</em>, in which he uses Mormon scripture to espouse anti-big government beliefs. Sitting in Starbucks in the Utah city of Orem \u2013 and, as a devout Mormon, scrupulously avoiding the coffee \u2013 Boyack can't disguise his contempt for Romney. \"I think he's horrible. I say that without hesitation. As a person I am sure that he is a good husband and father and a shrewd businessman. That's not a statement on his character. It's a statement on his public policies. They are horrible,\" he said.</p> <p>Would he vote for Romney? \"Certainly not,\" he replied.</p> <p><strong>But perhaps no one</strong> should be surprised that a more nuanced picture of the faith is emerging as Mormonism emerges into the mainstream alongside Romney's presidential campaign. After all, no community of millions of people can be a homogenous bloc backing a co-religionist. Especially when it comes to Romney, who \u2013 fearful of angering the Republican evangelical right \u2013 makes little reference to his faith.</p> <p>Yet Mormonism has deep abiding characteristics that does unite members. Nearly all Mormons have an overwhelming focus on family, believing the family unit to be sacred and eternal. They believe it extends after death, hence the controversial practice of baptising the dead. Salt Lake City and other Mormon-heavy communities seem full to bursting with young couples with large broods of children settled into suburban life. \"About the one sort of cult that the Mormons don't mind being called is a cult of the family,\" said Lott.</p> <p>This, perhaps coupled with religious restrictions on caffeine and alcohol, appears to have created a highly productive work ethic that has meant Utah has emerged as an attractive place for companies to relocate. The centre of Salt Lake City has sprouted new skyscrapers that tower over the delicate spires of the city's Temple, the true spiritual home of the faith. It is also a tight-knit community in which the church plays a huge role.</p> <p>Tithing \u2013 where a percentage of income is given to church charities \u2013 is very common. Mormons are supported by an activist church, generous in its welfare programmes and which provides a cheap higher education at Salt Lake City's Brigham Young University: something debt-laden non-Mormon college students in America are intensely envious of. All of that, coupled with its history of persecution, has sometimes led to accusations of an insular culture whose self-reliance can be seen as defensiveness. \"Sometimes there is not a lot of love for Mormons in the world,\" said Young-Otterstrom.</p> <p>The rest of America is certainly curious but not always kindly. The Mormon habit of wearing sacred undergarments, which look a little like old-fashioned long-johns, has become the butt of \"magic underpants\" jokes.</p> <p>The teachings of Mormonism are also likely to raise a few eyebrows as they become better known. Mormonism describes a history in which Christ visits America and in which Native Americans are the descendants of a lost tribe of Israel. Added to that is the controversial history of the church, which saw founder Joseph Smith murdered by a mob and which once discriminated against black people. In the face of this, it is perhaps no surprise that Romney has rarely spoken of his beliefs in terms of Mormonism, but rather in terms of devotion to Jesus. In 2007, before his first run for the Republican nomination, Romney sought to kill the issue. He gave a heavily touted speech in which he said: \"I believe in my Mormon faith and I endeavour to live by it.\" But that was the only moment in the speech he said the word \"Mormon\". And the 2012 campaign has shown there is a huge difference between Romney's no-doubt-sincere private commitment to Mormonism and his public one.</p> <p>Despite Romney's reticence, Mormonism is clearly growing in the collective consciousness of an America that once sought bloodily to exterminate it. And the church knows that the Romney run is an opportunity. \"Mormonism is the most ambitious religion that I have ever encountered. I think that the view of the church when it comes to Romney's run is that it will be worth it, win or lose,\" said Lott.</p> <p>The church has been assiduously preparing for the spotlight. Since 2010 it has spent millions of dollars on a publicity campaign called \"I am a Mormon\" that is aimed at highlighting the ordinary Americanness of its members. Websites have been set up to counter myths \u2013 especially related to polygamy, which the church banned more than a century ago.</p> <p>Some local congregations have been organising outreach sessions with non-Mormons, often in states far away from Utah. And all the time the church is insisting that it does not want to get involved in the rough and tumble world of US presidential politics.</p> <p>\"We hope our members will take the time to be informed on issues and candidates and will participate in the political process,\" said Eric Hawkins, a senior church spokesman. \"However, how they choose to do this is a completely private matter, and will not be directed by the church.\"</p> <p>There is a good reason for that. Mormonism's focus on the family led it to get involved in the fight over gay marriage in California. That stance led gay activists to picket and protest outside Mormon temples across America. Suddenly people who are often known simply for being unnaturally nice and polite were being called hate-mongers. It was a lesson in how mixing religion and politics can backfire rapidly.</p> <p>No wonder the church refuses in 2012 to get involved even on behalf of one of its own. \"The church is strictly politically neutral and does not participate in partisan politics by endorsing political candidates,\" Hawkins said. Those conspiracy theorists who fear Romney is some sort of Mormon Manchurian candidate have little supporting evidence.</p> <p>As the church grows it is likely to become more politically diverse. That is already being shown by the recent successes of Mormon writer Joanna Brooks, whose 2012 autobiography <em>The Book of Mormon Girl</em> has been a huge critical success. Brooks's story of her faith and avowed feminism has seen her appear on everything from <em>The Daily Show</em> to Fox Business to NPR and the BBC.</p> <p>Brooks has shown that it is possible to be a religious Mormon and a feminist, just as Boyack can mix his faith with libertarianism and Olsen can combine his with being leftwing. Mormonism, despite its old image of bearded prophets leading multiple wives through the wilderness, has always been flexible.</p> <p>Indeed its supreme adaptiveness is often cited as a reason for its position as America's homegrown faith. When polygamy proved a political hurdle, the practice was dumped. When civil rights arose and society changed, so too did the Mormon attitude to race. Like so many American social movements, it ignored its past, embraced the future and moved on. Many suspect it will eventually do that with gay rights, its current millstone.</p> <p>Janis hopes so: \"Gay rights is a very important thing to me. As a religious minority myself, any threat to another minority and their ability to act according to their conscience is a real problem for me.\"</p> <p>Indeed, when contemplating the prospect of a Mormon president in the shape of Romney, Janis does not really see the future of the faith. Instead, he sees a throwback: a conservative white male with rightwing opinions on everything from attacking Iran to tax breaks for the rich to gay rights.</p> <p>\"I remember the last time we had a Republican president in the shape of George W Bush. He was the most unpopular person in the world. Having a Mormon as the new most unpopular person in the world would worry me,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Two years ago, in the weeks before America's 2010 elections, I suggested that the safest strategy for voters was to disbelieve all political advertising. It's even more important now.</p> <p>The barrage of lies and distortions this year is looking to dwarf what we saw in the last national campaign. But this time, a huge amount of the money being spent to poison voters' minds is coming from people who lack the honor and/or courage to admit what they're doing.</p> <p>The ads range from slimy to scurrilous, and come mostly from the political right. Those are intended to put Mitt Romney in the White House and install a firmly hard-right Congress, as well as electing Republicans in state races around the nation. The biggest of the organizations creating the ads are giving anonymity to their funders. They are funded by unnamed people and corporations, and congressional Republicans have seen to it these cowards can snipe with impunity.</p> <p>Two of <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/two-dark-money-groups-outspending-all-super-pacs-combined/\">what ProPublica, a nonprofit journalism organization, calls \"dark-money\" groups</a> are out-raising and out-spending the organizations that (by law) must say who pays the bills. The two mega-money groups are \"Crossroads GPS\" and \"Americans for Prosperity\" \u2013 the former is a brainchild of Republican operative (and News Corp's Wall Street Journal op-ed columnist) Karl Rove \u2013 and the latter is believed to get at least some of its money from the mega-rich Koch family, which has made a mission of returning America to the lamented era of domination by robber barons.</p> <p>Little of their sludge lands on me. I use the web much more than TV, and I have a hard-disk video recorder in between my satellite dish and television, so I never watch live TV anymore. The recorder, connected to a satellite system, has a button that makes 30 seconds disappear; I use it liberally, and advertising has essentially disappeared from my viewing.</p> <p>But most American television viewers don't have or use such aids, and can scarcely avoid the onslaught of negative ads. They're directly in the advertisers' cross-hairs if they live in \"swing states\", where the outcome of the presidential race is in doubt. (I live in California, where the outcome of presidential and Senate races is not in doubt; the sleazy ads will come later and address, if that's the right word, a variety of ballot propositions.)</p> <p>One of the great scandals in this rancid avalanche is something Americans won't be told by the broadcasters: the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/07/who-gets-value-for-money-2billion-election\">TV networks and local stations are making immense profits from these political ads</a>. Hundreds of millions of dollars will flow into the coffers of media companies this year from these sources. The very notion that TV \"news\" \u2013 a word that almost always belongs in sarcastic quotes \u2013 would bite the hand that feeds it is, well, absurd. Television is complicit in this thoroughly corrupt system.</p> <p>We need two kinds of disclosure. One is to unmask the anonymous cowards who pay for the rancid advertising. Since that won't happen as long as Republicans can block legislation, we can at least force some disclosure on the media companies. Naturally, the media industry has been fighting even tame federal regulations that would require the biggest broadcasters to disclose online what they're being paid, and by which organizations, for political advertising. The hypocrisy of media conglomerates, which (occasionally) insist on transparency in government but resist it themselves, is unsurprising.</p> <p>Several journalism and public-interest groups, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/if-tv-stations-wont-post-their-data-on-political-ads-we-will\">including ProPublica</a> and <a href=\"http://www.freepress.net/blog/2012/08/10/seeking-political-ad-sleuths\">Free Press</a>, are trying to persuade citizen journalists in local communities to visit broadcasters' premises and copy the documents which those companies legally must file on paper already, and then post the results online. This is a useful exercise, especially given that the FCC rules \u2013 assuming they're ever obeyed or enforced \u2013 apply only to major TV markets.</p> <p>In the end, we need to persuade the voters that they should do more than ignore the sleazy advertising. They should assume that what they're seeing and hearing is false. This is a hard idea to sell, because at least some of the political advertising has to contain at least some truth. The problem is that we can't know what is truthful and what's not \u2013 and we're crazy if we trust anything we're told by people who hide anonymously in the shadows. Since Congress won't insist on disclosure, the only practical approach for now is to believe nothing.</p>",
  "<p>Over the last few days, Israeli newspapers have been consumed by reports that the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has <a href=\"http://world.time.com/2012/08/13/why-do-israeli-media-keep-predicting-war-with-iran/\" title=\"\">decided to launch an attack</a> on Iranian nuclear facilities some time this autumn. Although Netanyahu has an obvious interest in increasing pressure on Iran, it would be <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2012/05/21/if-the-baghdad-nuclear-talks-fail-netanyahu-is-likely-to-attack-iran/\" title=\"\">an error</a> to regard these reports as simple rhetorical sensationalism. In my opinion, whether this year or next, Israel is likely to use its airforce to attack Iran.</p> <p>While it is impossible to know for sure whether Netanyahu will act, it is possible to consider the likely repercussions that would follow an Israeli attack. While it is likely that Iran would retaliate against Israel and possibly the US in response to any attack, it is unlikely that Iran will instigate a major war. Albeit for different reasons, Iran, Israel and the US all understand that a war would not serve their interests.</p> <p>First, the Israeli policy angle. If Netanyahu decides to order an attack on Iran, his focus will be on maximising the success of that action and minimising any negative consequences that might follow. In terms of Iranian retaliation, Israel would expect Iran's core non-state allies Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_2012_Gaza-Israel_clashes\" title=\"\">launch rocket attacks</a> into Israeli territory.</p> <p>However, present success with advanced defence systems has helped increase Israeli confidence in their ability to absorb this method of retaliation. Beyond rocket attacks, the Israeli leadership also understands that a likely mechanism for Iranian retaliation is via attacks against Israeli interests internationally. Whether carried out by the Iranian <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quds_Force\" title=\"\">Quds Force</a> or Hezbollah, or a combination of both, various incidents this year have shown Israel that Iran continues to regard <a href=\"http://www.tomroganthinks.com/2012/07/bulgaria-bus-explosion.html\" title=\"\">covert action</a> as a powerful weapon.</p> <p>The key for Israel is that, while these Iranian capabilities are seen as credible, they are not seen to pose intolerable threats to Israel. Faced with rocket strikes or limited attacks abroad \u2013 to which the likely response would be air strikes or short-duration ground operations (not <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Lebanon_War\" title=\"\">a repeat of 2006</a>) in Lebanon and Gaza \u2013 Israel would be unlikely to pursue major secondary retaliation against Iran. Certainly, Israel would not want to encourage intervention by Syria's Assad alongside Iran (an outcome that might follow major retaliatory Israeli action).</p> <p>If Netanyahu does decide to take action, Israeli objectives would be clearly limited. The intent would be to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear capability while minimising escalation towards war. Israel has no interest in a major conflict that would risk serious damage to the Israeli state.</p> <p>Though holding opposite objectives, Iran's attitude concerning a major war is similar to Israel's.</p> <p>While Iran regards nuclear capability as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/24/iran-sanctions-nuclear\" title=\"\">prospectively guaranteeing</a> the survival of its Islamic revolution, clerical leaders also understand that initiating a major war would make American intervention likely. Such intervention would pose an existential threat to the theocratic project that underpins the Islamic Republic.</p> <p>Thus, in the event of an Israeli attack, Iran's response would be finely calibrated towards achieving three objectives:</p> <p>\u2022 First, punishing Israel for its attack.</p> <p>\u2022 Second, deterring further Israeli strikes and so creating space for a reconstituted Iranian nuclear programme.</p> <p>\u2022 Finally, weakening US/international support for Israel so as to increase Israeli isolation and vulnerability.</p> <p>Hezbollah, Hamas and other non-state allies would play a major role in effecting Iranian retaliation. Iran may also attempt to launch a number of its new <a href=\"http://iranprimer.usip.org/resource/irans-ballistic-missile-program\" title=\"\">Sajjil-2 medium-range missiles</a> against Israel. Again, however, using these missiles would risk major retaliation if many Israeli citizens were killed.</p> <p>As a preference, Iran would probably perceive that utilising Hamas and Hezbollah would allow retaliation without forcing Netanyahu into a massive counter-response. Crucially, I believe Iran regards that balancing its response would enable it to buy time for a reconstituted, hardened nuclear programme. In contrast to the <a href=\"http://www.isisnucleariran.org/sites/\" title=\"\">relatively open current structure</a>, sites would be deeper underground and far less vulnerable to a future attack. The nuclear ambition would not be lost, simply delayed.&#xa0;</p> <p>As a final objective for retaliation, Iran would wish to weaken Israel's relationship with the US and the international community. This desire might encourage Iran to take action against US navy assets in the Gulf and/or attempt to mine the Strait of Hormuz, so as to cause a price spike in global oil markets and increased international discomfort.</p> <p>However, beyond their rhetoric, the Iranian leadership understand that they cannot win a military contest against the US, nor hold the strait for longer than a few days. For Iran then, as with Israel, regional war is far from desirable.</p> <p>Finally, consider the US. It is now clear that Obama and Netanyahu <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCdR0-sxm1w\" title=\"\">disagree on Iran</a>. In my opinion, Netanyahu does not believe Obama will ever be willing to take pre-emptive military action against Iran's nuclear programme. Conversely, Obama believes Netanyahu's diplomatic expectations are too hasty and excessively restrictive.</p> <p>The policy distance between these two leaders appears increasingly irreconcilable. If Netanyahu decides to go it alone and attack Iran, the US president will face the unpleasant scenario of having to protect American interests while avoiding an escalation dynamic that might spin out of control towards war. This difficulty is accentuated by Obama's re-election race and his fear of the domestic economic fallout that may come from the decisions that he might have to make. Again, the simple point is that the US government has no interest in a war with Iran.&#xa0;</p> <p>If Netanyahu decides to take military action, he will do so in a strategic environment in which Israel, Iran and the US have no preference for a major war. Each state views the prospect of a war as counter to their particular long-term ambitions.</p> <p>Because of this, while serious, Iranian retaliation would be unlikely to produce an escalatory dynamic leading to war. The leadership of each of these states will restrain their respective actions in the pursuit of differing long-term objectives but common short-term ones.</p> <p>\u2022 Comments on this article are currently set to remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed earlier</p>",
  "<p>The Obama campaign team has kept up the pressure on Mitt Romney's tricky position on tax, promising to stop hounding him on the subject if he releases five years' worth of returns.</p> <p>Obama's campaign manager, Jim Messina, wrote to his opposite number in the Romney camp, Matt Rhoades, making the offer in writing. The Romney campaign did not take up the offer.</p> <p>The letter is aimed at addressing one of the frequent complaints by the Romney campaign that if he releases five years' worth of tax returns, the Obama campaign will demand 10, and if he releases 10, they will demand 20.</p> <p>The Messina letter came after Romney, talking to reporters on the campaign trail Thursday, disclosed that he had paid at least 13.6% in taxes over a 10- year period. The Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid had claimed, based on an alleged informant inside Bain Capital, where Romney made his fortune, that the Republican presidential challenger had paid no tax whatsoever.</p> <p>Reid, not satisfied with Romney's answer, called on his to release his tax returns to prove his 13.6% claim.</p> <p>Romney has released his tax returns for 2010 and 2011 but the Obama team said he should follow the precedent of other presidential challengers by disclosing tax returns for a much longer period.</p> <p>Messina, in his letter, wrote: \"I am writing to ask again that the governor release multiple years of tax returns, but also to make an offer that should address his concerns about the additional disclosures.</p> <p>\"Governor Romney apparently fears that the more he offers, the more our campaign will demand that he provide. So I am prepared to provide assurances on just that point: if the governor will release five years of returns, I commit in turn that we will not criticise him for not releasing more \u2013 neither in ads nor in other public communications or commentary for the rest of the campaign.\"</p> <p>Messina added that, given Romney has already released tax returns for 2010 and 2011, he would only have to release a further three, dating back to 2007.</p> <p>Rhoades, in his reply, said: \"It is clear that President Obama wants nothing more than to talk about Governor Romney's tax returns instead of the issues that matter to voters, like putting Americans back to work, fixing the economy and reining in spending.</p> <p>\"If Governor Romney's tax returns are the core message of your campaign, there will be ample time for President Obama to discuss them over the next 81 days.\"</p> <p>Romney's vice-presidential running mate, Paul Ryan, on Friday released tax returns showing he paid an effective rate of 20% in 2011, roughly in line with Obama's rate and likely higher than that of Romney. Ryan's release aligns him with Romney's position that giving out two years of tax returns is adequate.</p>"
