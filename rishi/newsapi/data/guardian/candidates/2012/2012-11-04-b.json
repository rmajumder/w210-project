I was in Atlanta, Georgia that day and I remember the line snaking right round the school where the polling station was set up; on and on it went. This year I truly didn't expect to see anything nearly as impressive, what with the mood of the country being so sour and the economy still so sluggish. But I've just seen one of the longest lines I've ever seen at the polling station in downtown Cleveland. It was so long it went round the block and around another block. I walked all the way along it and counted my steps \u2013 400 full paces of voters queuing up dutifully in the cold to cast their ballot. You'd have to be pretty cynical not to find that impressive.</p> <p>The line is 90% African American, I'd say, and every one of the people I spoke to were intending to vote for Barack Obama. This is Souls to the Polls day when black churches encourage their congregation from all over the city to come to the polling station and vote. I've come down here with a black church from the suburbs, God's Tabernacle of Faith. Pastor Thomas Eppinger finished his Sunday service, then piled his congregants into two vans and brought them to the polling station.</p> <p>It takes some determination on a cold day like this to join the very back of the queue. But that is what Barbara Dixon, 39, had just done when I spoke to her just now. She said she was happy to wait \"as long as it takes because I want to make sure this election is won by a president who has values that I care about\". She's got at least two hours to go before she gets to the voting booth, but really she didn't seem at all bothered.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-dd51ea76-1ff1-4d58-8dfd-c591cc8ca906\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/4/1352064233397/-460.jpeg\" alt=\"voters queue in Cleveland, Ohio\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People in Cleveland, Ohio, waited in long queues to cast early votes.

Saturday night was bitterly cold in Bristow, Virginia, but that didn\u2019t stop thousands coming to a rally addressed by the two best orators their party has produced since Robert Kennedy. \u201cIt\u2019s once in a lifetime,\u201d Jennifer Rodriguez, a nurse who\u2019d made the journey from Richmond, told me.</p> <p>Of course Bill Clinton has to play the support act these days, but he does so with huge heart. He bounded on stage in brown leather bomber jacket, wrapped up far less warmly than his audience, and delivered what was largely a reprise of his Charlotte showstopper, when he wowed the Democratic convention with a masterclass in substantive rhetoric, patiently laying out the policy-based reasons why the American people should re-elect their president. His voice was so hoarse, you wondered if it would give out. But the crowd stayed with him, lapping up the unarguable simplicity of lines such as \u201c\u2019We\u2019re all in this together\u2019 is better than \u2018you\u2019re on your own.\u2019\u201d And he can still work a rally like the most seasoned Catskills comic. Of Mitt Romney\u2019s multiple positions on the auto-bailout, Clinton said: \"He\u2019s tied himself up in so many knots, he could be hired as the chief contortionist of Cirque du Soleil.\u201d</p> <p>There were two moments of almost imperceptible tension. One came early, when Clinton confessed himself \u201cmore excited\u201d about supporting Barack Obama \u201ceven than I was four years ago.\u201d It brought a fleeting reminder that in early 2008, Bill Clinton was devoting all his red-faced energy to dismissing the Obama candidacy as a \u201cfairytale.\u201d Later the former president spoke of the ailment known as Romnesia, the habit of forgetting the Republican\u2019s past record. I\u2019m pretty sure I heard him add, as an aside, that \u201cHis opponent may even have got a bit of it.\u201d That sounded like a reference to Obama himself, an apparent dig at the president\u2019s failure, especially in the first debate, to nail Romney\u2019s many contradictions.</p> <p>If that's what it was, few noticed it. Instead, the crowd cheered for Obama when he come on to high-five and hug his predecessor - and cheered louder as he delivered a strong, confident and, at times, stirring performance. He lavished praise on Clinton, saying his team \u201ccalls him the Secretary of Explaining Stuff\u201d. He added that \u201cthe only person working harder than he is is Hillary.\u201d</p> <p>When the speeches were over, the two men worked the ropeline together to the sound of Clinton\u2019s old anthem, Don\u2019t Stop Thinking About Tomorrow. Yesterday the Clintons were Obama\u2019s foes. Today they are two of his most useful friends.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-4904d4d3-5714-4a5d-998e-7e76eee714bb\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/4/1352038483183/f647848e-9104-48a6-b46d-7885295c6730-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Bill Clinton and Barack Obama in Virginia\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bill Clinton and Barack Obama at their joint appearance in Bristow, Virginia, on Saturday night.

  "<p>\"You see what I'm talking about now,\" pastor Thomas Eppinger said as our van drove alongside the queue outside the polling station in downtown Cleveland. The line went along the block, around the corner and then round another corner, with more than a thousand people waiting patiently to vote in the bitter cold.</p> <p>Sunday was 'souls to the polls' day in Cleveland, as it was in Cincinnati and Columbus and other towns across Ohio, and throughout black urban communities across America. Congregations like Pastor Eppinger's had gathered in the morning to sing and pray, then jumped in vans and descended on polling stations to practise their hard-won right to vote.</p> <p>Despite a wait in line of at least two hours, these Cleveland voters, overwhelmingly black and overwhelmingly pro-Obama, showed no sign of disgruntlement. Barbara Dixon, 39, who had just joined the very back of the queue, said she was happy to hold on \"as long as it takes, as I want to make sure that this election is won by a president who has values\".</p> <p>Given the voting preferences of the crowd, it was very much in the interests of the Obama campaign to keep everyone happy and in queue, despite the wait. So they passed down boxes of free pizza, and cheered people up by having music star John Legend walk down the line.</p> <p>Cabral Franklin, 38, handing out pizza on behalf of the Obama campaign, said he thought the turnout was huge because black voters were anxious. \"I think people fear Obama is going to need every vote he can get as the election is going to be so close.\"</p> <p>Kim Hemphill, 47, having already fulfilled her two hours and standing at the front, said it had definitely been worth it \"and that's not just because Obama's handsome and black. He has helped us, he's our president.\"</p> <p>For Eppinger's congregation at the church of God's Tabernacle of Faith church in a suburb of Cleveland, Sunday began with his weekly service in which he didn't mince his words. \"Today is a historic day, 'souls to the polls' day. So get down to the polls and vote. Our folks died to get us the right to vote, so go out and use it,\" he told his flock.</p> <p>In recent years, the practice of going to church on the last Sunday before election day and then going together to vote has become a fundamental African American tradition. \"It's our way of teaching our young people that you can't just sit on the side-lines criticising your leaders if you don't vote,\" Eppinger said in an interview.</p> <p>But the day has much more than cultural significance. With all eyes focused on Ohio, the ultimate battleground state, the turnout among African Americans has the potential to swing the election.</p> <p>Cuyahoga County, in which Cleveland sits, is the most heavily-populated area of the state, and almost a third of its 1.3 million people are African American. Exit polls in 2008 showed that black Ohioans made up 11% of the vote, with an overwhelming 98% of them backing Obama.</p> <p>There's an additional poignancy to souls to the polls in Ohio this year that has made the congregation of God's Tabernacle of Faith take the drive to the polling station particularly personally. Because this was a day that very nearly didn't happen.</p> <p>Earlier this year, John Husted, Ohio's Republican secretary of state, announced that he was closing polling stations on the last three days of the election. That included the final Sunday before election day \u2013 the very day that many African Americans hold sacred as the day they take their souls to the polls.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398836928\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/4/1352067428437/09518b30-0bcc-448b-8233-d17f24725f05-460.jpeg\" alt=\"People wait in line for early voting in the parking lot of the Northland Park Center on 4 November 2012 in Columbus, Ohio.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People wait in line for early voting in the parking lot of the Northland Park Center on 4 November 2012 in Columbus, Ohio.

But Eppinger's congregants took it as a blatant attempt to stand in the way of their vote.</p> <p>\"Husted was trying to throw a monkey wrench into the deal,\" said Henry Warren, 64, who had come for Sunday service. \"But it won't work \u2013 if you tell somebody they can't have something, then they want it that much more.\"</p> <p>\"He had a hidden agenda in doing this,\" Eppinger said. \"Isn't it strange that he tried to stop souls to the polls after a historically high turnout in 2008 elected America's first African American president?\"</p> <p>In the end, the highly charged dispute over final Sunday voting went all the way to the US supreme court. Last month, the justices effectively ordered Husted to drop his decree and keep the polls open.</p> <p>Eric Kearney, leader of the Democratic group in the Ohio state senate, presented a brief to the supreme court calling for on the justices to keep the early voting. \"Souls to the polls this year perfectly moulds that church tradition and the need to re-elect the first African American president,\" he said.</p> <p>Denise Bullock, 53, was on the bus from God's Tabernacle of Faith to the polling station in downtown Cleveland. Though she knew she would have to potentially wait for several hours before she could cast her ballot she was determined to do it.</p> <p>\"My family has looked into our ancestry and I know that some of my forebears died fighting for the right to vote, and it's always been something we talk about that we must vote in their memory. I was taught that by my parents when I was a child, and it's what I taught my children and it's what they will tell their children.</p> <p>Church volunteers have been canvassing the local area to encourage people to participate in the voting drive. The campaign is not non-party political \u2013 Eppinger stressed to his congregation during his Sunday service that the point was to vote, not to vote for a particular party or candidate.</p> <p>Members of the church have circulated the neighbourhood with leaflets saying: \"I am a vessel and I vote\". The flier promises that \"we will pick you up and drop off wherever\".</p> <p>Democratic organisers hope that such dedicated outreach from black churches will sustain enthusiasm and thus turnout among black voters this year, giving Obama the edge. Blowing in the other direction though are harsh economic winds that have sustained unemployment levels among black Ohioans at above 13% \u2013 more than five points higher than the general US population.</p> <p>Eppinger said that he did not blame Obama for black economic woes. \"We know that African Africans have for years been last hired, first fired. When a company downsizes, it's the black worker who suffers,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Little by little, we are slipping unconsciously into a new world order. Some have called it a G-zero world, in which no one nation is powerful enough to lead, but each is<strong> </strong>strong enough to prevent the other from having its way. America's retreat can be traced to the burial of two assumptions it held as universal truths when the Soviet Union collapsed. One was the fatally flawed belief it could remake failed states in its image. History, language, culture, geography did not count. Democracy could be unpacked by a <a href=\"http://afghanistan.usaid.gov/en/partnerships/partners_provincial_resconstruction_teams\" title=\"\">provincial reconstruction team</a> from the back of a Chinook. Nation building died a slow and ugly death in Iraq and Afghanistan. The other was the belief that deregulated, unfettered globalised capital was the natural world order. That died with Lehman Brothers.</p> <p>Much of what George W Bush did wrong in his first term as president, Bill Clinton did too, only it was not as immediately noticeable in Boris Yeltsin's Russia as it was in Iraq in 2003. It took three presidents for these illusions to be shed, and Barack Obama's own contribution to two decades of military hubris was ordering the troop surge in Afghanistan. Leading from behind is the infelicitous phrase Mr Obama used to describe the US role in Libya, but even that fails to catch the constraints that now ground the projection of US power.</p> <p>The fact that liberated Libya is a more lethal place for US personnel than the unliberated country was represents another part of the same learning curve. The US, Britain and France have yet to give a full account of their relations with the deposed Arab dictators in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya. Nor will western powers today come clean about their support for Saudi Arabia and Jordan, which are in the process of organising a counter-revolution against pro-democracy protests in the Gulf states, on whose airfields the US would depend for an attack on Iran.</p> <p>These then are really quite narrow parameters within which to decide who could make the better president, Mr Obama or Mitt Romney. The incumbent Mr Obama has become by dint of experience shorn of illusion, in many ways the antithesis of the man who gave that soaring speech in Cairo. He is prepared only to devote his time to problems he thinks he can change, but by the same token he is more prepared to use lethal force in the form of drones than any of his predecessors. He has become a realist in the mould of Brent Scowcroft.</p> <p>Mr Obama faces a Republican challenger who has cared so little about the subject that would take up so much of his time as president, that he has adopted many of the same neocons \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/johncassidy/2012/09/mitt-romneys-libya-blunder-reflects-larger-failings.html\" title=\"\">John Bolton, Reuel Marc Gerecht, Eliot Cohen</a> \u2013 who as former members of the Project for the New American Century, got US policy into the mess it is in. These men are serial offenders, responsible for the sort of blunder Mr Romney makes after hours of hard deliberation. Not comments like the one he made twice in his campaign that Syria is apparently Iran's <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/23/mitt-romney-foreign-policy-debate_n_2005833.html\" title=\"\">route to the sea</a>. The biggest foreign blunder of his campaign, his attack on statements issued by the US embassy in Cairo before it became known that a US ambassador had been killed in Libya, was made on the unanimous recommendation of these people.</p> <p>Think, too, of the challenges the next president faces, chief of which is to defuse through negotiation the crisis over Iran's nuclear enrichment programme. Closely linked to this is a civil war in Syria, in which there is a military stalemate. The minute Bashar al-Assad's regime were to fall, the effects of the loss of a Shia-led regime, even a Baathist one, would be felt the next day in Iraq. Egypt and Tunisia's relatively bloodless revolutions are still in the balance. Jordan and the Gulf states are being shaken by the same forces that toppled the dictators in the Arab republics. In Afghanistan, a US troop withdrawal has to be managed in the worst possible conditions. China meanwhile is fast building its naval forces and flexing its territorial claims in the South China Sea. The list is by no means exhaustive but the choice of who is better equipped to navigate the chaos of the new world disorder is crystal clear.</p>",

The modest lead for Obama marks a shift from a week ago when the two were tied on 47% before Sandy. Among likely voters, 69% said they approved of Obama's handling of the storm.</p> <p>The findings are similar to a Wall Street Journal/NBC poll published at the weekend.

They've tried to expand the map because they know in states like Ohio. They're behind and they're not catching up at this point.\" He added: \"They understand that the traditional, or the battleground, states that we've been focusing are not working out for them.\"</p> <p>A Washington Post/ABC poll had the two tied on 48% nationally while a Wall Street Journal/NBC one puts Obama on 48% to Romney on 47%, compared with last week when the two were on 47%.</p> <p>The WSJ/NBC poll shows Obama is being given credit by likely voters for his handling of hurricane Sandy, with nearly seven in 10 voters approving of his performance, with only 15% disapproving.</p> <p>Romney's political director Rich Beeson, also on Fox, questioned the credibility of the polls, often a sign of a campaign unhappy with the direction an election is headed, said: \"These polls are like nailing Jello to a tree. They are all over the place.\"</p> <p>He predicted that independents would turn out in greater numbers for Romney and that Republicans too will flood the polling booths. \"There's an intensity factor out there on the side of the Republicans, that is a significant gap and we see it out on the ground, we see it when people are knocking on the doors, we see it when people are making the phone calls,\" Beeson said.</p> <p>Asked about a controversial ad that the Romney campaign is broadcasting that claims jeep jobs are being sent to China as a result of Obama's bailout of the motor industry, Beeson ducked the question. Motor manufacturers have denied the claim but the Romney campaign has expanded the number of outlets for broadcasting the discredited ad.</p> <p>Obama, campaigning alongside Bill Clinton, attracted a crowd of 24,000 for a late-night rally in Virginia on Saturday night and 14,000 in New Hampshire on Sunday. The crowd in Virginia, while respectable for a cold evening, was well down on 2008 when an eve-of-election event at almost the same location attracted more than 80,000.</p> <p>Although Obama and Romney are tied nationally, Obama appears to be doing better in key swing states. In Iowa, the normally reliable Des Moines Register poll put Obama on 47% to Romney's 42%.</p> <p>In Ohio, which both campaigns are treating as potentially decisive, attracting more visits than the others, a Columbus Dispatch poll puts Obama on 50% to Romney's 48%.</p> <p>Campaigning in Iowa yesterday, Romney added a new line to his stump speech, saying that Obama's slogan 'Forward' should be renamed 'Forewarned', that a second term would look much like the first.</p> <p>Romney too is focused on a remark by Obama on Friday in which he told a crowd in Ohio not to boo. \"Voting is the best revenge,\" Obama said.</p> <p>Romney, in his speeches, said: \"Vote for revenge? Let me tell you: Vote for love of country.\"</p> <p>Campaigning alongside Bill Clinton in Concord, New Hampshire, on Sunday Obama drew a parallel with Clinton's presidency.</p> <p>\"Just as we did when Bill Clinton was president, we gotta ask the wealthiest to pay a little bit more so we can reduce the deficit and still invest in the things we need to grow,\" he said.</p> <p>Jen Psaki, the president's spokeswoman, said he was energised by the fact that this is the last time he will campaigning on his own behalf. \"I think he's really taking in the moments and taking in the times he has backstage with the introducers, and the conversations he has along the rope line, and it is really helping to bolster him through the final days,\" she told reporters.</p>",
  "<p>It is a Mitt Romney unfamiliar to most Americans. He appears with a bronze tan. He speaks of his father's Mexican upbringing. He makes no mention of undocumented immigrants. He speaks Spanish. \"Soy Mitt Romney, y apruebo este mensaje\". I'm Mitt Romney, and I approve this message.</p> <p>The Republican party's right-wing would probably be less approving but it tends not to see or hear such messages because this version of Romney airs on Spanish-language media and is aimed at Latino voters.</p> <p>The GOP and Super Pac supporters have ramped up this parallel advertising campaign in swing states such as Colorado, Florida and Nevada as a protective wall against the wave of Latino support for President Barack Obama. It does not appear to have worked. Consecutive polls show Obama leading Romney by around 70% to 30%.</p> <p>\"Much of the Spanish-language advertising for the Romney campaign has been very, very bad,\" said Gary Segura, a professor of political science at Stanford university and a principal at the polling firm <a href=\"http://www.latinodecisions.com/blog/about/\">Latino Decisions</a>. \"Although given the circumstances, there's not much any advertising campaign could have done.\"</p> <p>The circumstances are the hard line Romney took on undocumented immigrants to clinch the Republican nomination earlier this year. He called for \"self-deportation\" \u2013 a euphemism to make life so miserable for the undocumented they leave the United States \u2013 and appointed <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-leopold/mitt-romneys-kris-kobach-_b_1903051.html?utm_hp_ref=\" immigration-reform\"\">Kris Kobach</a>, the architect of Arizona's draconian immigration law, as an adviser.</p> <p>Romney recognised the damage. Back in April reporters overheard him at a private fundraiser in Florida warning that Obama's lead among Latinos \"<a href=\"http://colorlines.com/archives/2012/04/mitt_romney_not_winning_latino_vote_spells_doom_for_us.html\">spells doom for us</a>\".</p> <p>Republican strategists concluded Romney did not need to match George W Bush's 44% Latino support in 2004 but that he needed to do significantly better than John McCain's 31% in 2008.</p> <p>Romney dispatched his son Craig, a former missionary in Chile who speaks fluent Spanish, to tour swing states. And in September the candidate appeared on Univision, the Spanish-language TV behemoth, to be grilled by Mar\u00eda Elena Salinas and Jorge Ramos, the Walter Cronkite of Latino media.</p> <p>Republican organisers packed the audience with whooping supporters and Romney acquitted himself reasonably well but commentary focused on his unusually deep, orange-tinted tan which <a href=\"http://univisionnews.tumblr.com/post/32196711271/its-not-an-oompa-loompa-its-mitt-romney\">triggered mocking accusations</a> of cosmetic pandering to Latinos.</p> <p>\"Too bad the oompa loompa population dwindled 25 years ago,\" said one tweet.</p> <p>Romney aides said he had been campaigning in Florida sunshine before the show.</p> <p>With Latino numbers not improving the GOP and Super Pac backers like Crossroads GPS spent about $4.6m on Spanish-language television stations in Colorado, Florida and Nevada, according to Kantar media.</p> <p>The ads were mostly translated versions of Romney's English-language ads, tweaked to include references to his father's Mexican heritage and the \"Soy Mitt Romney\" sign-off at the end.</p> <p>He hammered the theme he would be a better economic steward. \"Our economic recovery needs the success of the Hispanic community, but President Obama's misguided policies are dragging down businesses.\"</p> <p>Another ad showed euphoria for Obama in 2008, followed by Latino voters detailing broken promises. Another ad lamented Latino poverty and unemployment. \"When Obama and his Democratic allies tell us 'Yes we can,' we have to tell them, 'We can't take anymore,'\" says the narrator.</p> <p>The Obama campaign, however, spent twice almost as much, $8.9m, and the president, who like Romney does not speak Spanish, mastered phonetics for a 30-second spot of passable Spanish.</p> <p>\"In the young people known as the Dreamers I see the same qualities that Michelle and I try to instil in our daughters,\" he intones, referring to young undocumented immigrants seeking citizenship. Images show the Obama family, followed by studious Latinos. \"As a father, they inspire me. And as president, their bravery has reminded me that no obstacle is too large, and no road is too long.\"</p> <p>Another spot features Cristina Saralegui, a television presenter dubbed the Latina Oprah, endorsing Obama in colloquial, rhyming Spanish. \"Pa'tras? De eso nada! Pa'lante \u2013 con Obama!\" Going backward? None of that. Forward \u2013 with Obama!</p> <p>The president scored additional points in May by phoning in to the popular Denver-based KBNO radio show, La Voz del Pueblo, to josh with the host Fernando Sergio about, among other things, the Broncos. Romney declined invitations to do likewise. Last week <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jason-salzman/fernando-sergio-obama-endorsement_b_2006681.html\">Sergio endorsed Obama</a>.</p> <p>The president also appeared on the same Univision forum as Romney (on a separate day) for the requested hour, unlike his rival who gave only 30 minutes. Pressed by the hosts over the lack of immigration reform, Obama said it was his term's biggest failure, a devastating admission were it not for Romney's vulnerability on the issue.</p> <p>\"Some of Obama's ads go too far, they hint that the <a href=\"http://www.dhs.gov/deferred-action\">deferred action process</a>is a path to citizenship when it's not, but Romney has no credibility with Latinos. We can tell when we're being attacked,\" said Jessie Ramirez, 31, a high school career guidance counsellor at a Democratic rally in Denver.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2012/11/01/obama-has-almost-identical-lead-with-latinos-as-2008-poll-says/\">Fox News poll </a>on Friday showed Obama leading Romney among Latinos by 66% to 28% \u2013 a whopping margin keeping him competitive in Florida, Ohio, Nevada and New Mexico.</p> <p>Seguro, the analyst and pollster, said the Republican strategy, based on attack ads, now seemed to be discouraging Latinos from voting. \"My sense is they've given up on trying to persuade and are trying to suppress by making people think, a pox on both your houses.\"</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 It's fitting, surely, that an election race defined by imaginary gaffes based on absurdly selective quotations - remember \"you didn't build that\"? - should end with an imaginary gaffe based on an absurdly selective quotation. In Ohio on Friday, when Barack Obama fans booed a mention of Mitt Romney, the president told them: \"No, no, no, don't boo \u2013 vote. Voting is the best revenge.\" Never mind he was paraphrasing a famous saying about the merits of not behaving vengefully: he'd said the word \"revenge\"; and that meant class war. <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2012/11/03/romney_vote_for_love_of_country_not_revenge.html\" title=\"\">\"Vote for revenge?\"</a> said Romney rhetorically[, at an event soon afterwards: \"Let me tell you what I'd like to tell you: vote for love of country.\" The campaign swiftly threw together an ad: \"Revenge or love of country.\" Paul Ryan said during a campaign stop: \"Just yesterday, Obama was asking his supporters at a rally to vote out of revenge.\" (The Washington Post's resident right-wing blogger, Jennifer Rubin, dutifully castigated the president for \"an unseemly utterance\").Amid the deafening sound of Democratic foreheads being smacked from coast to coast in disbelief at the Romney campaign's sheer gall, no one noticed that the Republican challenger, in attacking the \"revenge\" line, had committed a far graver gaffe of his own. He told the crowd: \"Vote for \u2026 President Obama. President Obama [is] \u2026 the door to a brighter future.\" I've trimmed that quotation for reasons of space, and moved a couple of words around for clarity. But you get the gist.</p> <p>\u2022 Back in the world of non-imaginary gaffes, senior Democratic gaffologist Joe Biden did in fact unveil a classic over the weekend, by way of a campaign sign-off. \"I tell you what \u2013 there's never been a day in the last four years I've been proud to be [Obama's] vice-president,\" he told cheering supporters. \"Not one single day!\" Meanwhile here's senior Obama strategist David Axelrod, in Ohio, getting sweaty with appreciation for his boss: \"He believes in what he's doing. He believes in what he's fighting for. You can see in the speech that he's delivering that this is coming from his loins.\" Um, OK. That last part wasn't strictly necessary, but thanks anyway.</p> <p>\u2022 Post-Sandy Hurricane days it's quite natural that Rudy Giuliani, though a committed Republican, should show solidarity with the president as he oversees responses to the aftermath of the storm. Entirely natural \u2013 but far from the truth. Instead, the 9/11 leader is spending time calling for Obama's resignation. \"He should resign. He lied. He has been a disaster: the worst president for our economy in our lifetime,\" <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1112/83252_Page2.html\" title=\"\">Giuliani told a Romney rally</a>. \"He doesn't want a second term. He wants a second chance because he screwed it up the first time!\" Vicious words, but then at least Giuliani is bipartisan in that: in recent years he attacked a prominent Republican presidential candidate as <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2011/12/15/giuliani_thinks_gingrich_is_reagani.php\" title=\"\">\"a man without a core</a> \u2026 a man that will say anything to become president of the United States\". Awkwardly, that man was Romney. \"I've never seen a guy change his position so many times, so fast, on a dime,\" Giuliani said last year, stumping for Newt Gingrich. But perhaps it's unfair to call him wildly inconsistent. It's been clear for years that Giuliani, in his heart, believes there's only one person truly qualified to lead America: Rudy Giuliani.</p>",
  "<p>As hurricane Sandy barrelled towards the&#xa0;east coast, <a href=\"http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20121027/OPINION03/121026026/The-Des-Moines-Register-endorsement-Mitt-Romney-offers-fresh-economic-vision\" title=\"\">Iowa's Des Moines Register newspaper endorsed Mitt Romney</a> \u2013 the first Republican it had endorsed since Richard Nixon in&#xa0;1972 (look how that turned out). Arguing that \"the partisan divide had hardened\" under Barack Obama, the leader writers said: \"One of the biggest obstacles either candidate faces is partisan gridlock in Congress [which] has hampered not only the economy, but the entire country.\"</p> <p>A week earlier the Orlando Sentinel, which backed Obama in 2008 in the crucial state of Florida, made the same argument in its <a href=\"http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-10-19/opinion/os-ed-endorsement-president-mitt-romney-101912-20121018_1_trillion-deficit-reduction-plan-mitt-romney-obama-s-republican\" title=\"\">support for Romney</a>. \"With Obama in charge, the federal government came perilously close to a default last year,\" it said. \"It verges on magical thinking to expect Obama to get different results in the next four years.\"</p> <p>As Sandy inched closer, coverage of the campaign \u2013 like the campaigning itself \u2013 was suspended. All talk of gridlock was eclipsed by scenes of mayhem. One day reporters were standing in front of electoral maps analysing every poll, demographic and gaffe while speculating about the outcome. The next they were standing in sou'westers in wind and rain speculating about where it would make landfall. For a few days Ohio got a reprieve while New Jersey got a battering, and pollsters took a back seat while meteorologists drove the story.</p> <p>But when the winds subsided and the campaigns resumed, the dynamics of the race had changed and the validity of those arguments had been challenged. The hurricane and its aftermath helped illustrate the vacuity of this election campaign, what's at stake in its outcome, and who's responsible for the gridlock. With the frenetic polling and endless punditry, there may have been precious little calm before the storm but there was a greater degree of clarity after it.</p> <p>Beyond a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/us/politics/climate-change-nearly-absent-in-the-campaign.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" title=\"\">punchline for Romney at the Republican convention</a>, climate change simply has not come up during this election. Moderators didn't ask about it during the presidential debates, and both Obama and Romney were too busy posing as friends of oil and coal to mention it. While no single storm can be attributed to climate change, warming oceans make them more likely \u2013 and&#xa0;a clear pattern is emerging that would help to explain an occurrence such as Sandy. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/01/opinion/kristof-will-climate-get-some-respect-now.html\" title=\"\">As the New York Times's Nicolas Kristof pointed out</a>, three of the 10 biggest floods in lower Manhattan since 1900 have occurred in the past three years, while seven of the 10 warmest summers on record have taken place in the past 12.</p> <p>But to raise an issue like this during an election takes the kind of political courage that has long been in short supply. Given the hours of coverage and the billions of dollars devoted to the election, it's stunning how few of the nation's most glaring problems are being discussed. The US now has <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2012/01/30/120130crat_atlarge_gopnik?currentPage=all\" title=\"\">more people in its penal system</a> than the Soviet gulag at its height; its capital city has a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/life-expectancy-varies-widely-in-the-washington-area/2012/04/19/gIQAjShVWT_story.html\" title=\"\">male life expectancy</a> lower than that of <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html\" title=\"\">the Gaza Strip</a>; and the country openly operates a system of torture and a policy of targeted assassination. The fact that nobody even expects these issues to come up tells you something about the low expectations Americans have of their politicians.</p> <p>But Sandy concentrated minds. Disasters have a way of doing that. Its arrival prised a much coveted <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-01/a-vote-for-a-president-to-lead-on-climate-change.html\" title=\"\">endorsement for Obama from the New York city mayor, Michael Bloomberg</a>, an independent who formerly ran as a Republican. \"The devastation that Hurricane Sandy brought to New York City and much of the north-east \u2026 brought the stakes of next Tuesday's presidential election into sharp relief,\" he said. True, Obama had not campaigned on it \u2013 but at the very least he acknowledges its existence, made some efforts to address it, and is not beholden to a party that refuses to accept the science.</p> <p>As Bloomberg was penning his endorsement, Obama was touring storm-hit areas with the Republican governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie. Christie, Romney's <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1112/83254.html\" title=\"\">first pick for vice-president</a>, delivered a keynote speech at the Republican convention. The week before, he had <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/columnists/karen_heller/20121104_Karen_Heller__The_storms_before_the_calm.html\" title=\"\">described the president</a> as \"a man wandering around a dark room, hands up against the wall, clutching for the light switch of leadership, and he just can't find it\". Last week, when the lights went out, he <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/post/the-morning-plum-chris-christie-drives-stake-into-romney-closing-argument/2012/11/01/2a435398-240d-11e2-ac85-e669876c6a24_blog.html\" title=\"\">praised Obama for his handling of the storm</a>, saying: \"The president has been all over this and he deserves great credit.\"</p> <p>While Sandy prompted both Bloomberg's and Christie's conversions, elsewhere in the country came evidence of a deeper split in Republican ranks. In the Nebraska Senate race, <a href=\"http://azdailysun.com/news/state-and-regional/gop-voices-for-kerrey-show-deep-split-in-party/article_891c6e6b-b0f6-5497-8bab-8c061bff62d4.html\" title=\"\">several Republicans came out against</a> the Tea Party-supported candidate and for the Democrat, Bob Kerrey.</p> <p>A week earlier, George Bush's former secretary of state Colin Powell \u2013 a Republican \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1012/82860.html\" title=\"\">broke ranks again to back Obama</a>. \"I think I'm a Republican of more moderate mould and that's something of a dying breed, I'm sorry to say,\" he said. \"But, you know, the Republicans I worked for are President Reagan, President Bush, the Howard Bakers of the world, people who were conservative \u2026 but people who recognise that, at the end of the day, you got to find a basis for compromise. Compromise is how this country runs.\"</p> <p>Powell's breed may be further from extinction than has been apparent. For the past four years, Tea Party activists have been claiming they want to take their country back. Now a growing number of Republicans appear to want to take their party back.</p> <p>And so it was that by the end of last week you got a sense of what an Obama presidency might have been, and might be again, were it not for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/17/us-default-debt-ceiling-obama-congress\" title=\"\">the wilful obstruction of an opposition</a> whose primary stated aim was to deny him a second term: too timid for what is necessary but nonetheless the best that is possible within the narrow confines of American electoralism. Of course, he still has to win on Tuesday, which is by no means certain. But the dying days of the campaign put to rest one of the cases against him that has gained most traction among waverers.</p> <p>The arguments of the Des Moines Register and the Orlando Sentinel are true as far as they go. But they don't go very far unless they locate the source of the gridlock and hold to account those responsible for it. In the absence of that, handing the presidency to Romney becomes little more than <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/10/30/mitch-mcconnell-and-john-boehners-strategy-worked/\" title=\"\">a reward for bad behaviour</a>.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/garyyounge\" title=\"\"><em>@garyyounge</em></a></p>",
  "<p>America experienced a moment last week when forecast became fact; shockingly, concretely. Tomorrow, the same thing will happen. A speculative river will solidify into a hard fact. Whether it is the trajectory of the \"super storm\" Sandy, or the outcome of the presidential election, recent US media discourse has been dominated by forecasts, forecasting and those who make and disseminate them.</p> <p>Informed judgment, or speculation as it is less flatteringly known, has formed a key component of reporting for as long as the practice itself. The faulty forecast has become the dry rot in the flimsy framework of public trust in journalism. Failures to adequately anticipate phenomena, from al-Qaida's rise to the financial system's collapse, have contributed to an erosion of credibility. The \"bendy tree\" journalism of wind-blown TV news reporters has too often misled audiences about the threat of weather systems; the charts say one thing, the man in the Berghaus clinging to a lamppost another.</p> <p>As with every other branch of journalism, the dynamics of reporting \"what will happen\" are shifting from the qualitative model of expert opinion to the quantitative model of what can be extrapolated from measurement. One of the astonishing aspects of Sandy was how accurate the forecasts often were; foreseeing, for example, its move offshore before landing, as predicted, smack in the middle of New Jersey's shoreline.</p> <p>Thorough reporting soon followed, as a torrent of social media updates and photos tumbled into the stream of innovative efforts by big media. The rapid, sketchy information, false rumours and photos made some kind of sense of the scattered chaos. We watched, with timelines, maps and commentary, journalism get better before our very eyes.</p> <p>In a real storm, it seems the media can pull together, and make use of the streams and technologies which arrived to disrupt it. In US political forecasting, however, punditry has created its own fake storm, centring on the predictive powers of one man, Nate Silver. Silver's FiveThirtyEight blog makes his voice one of the most listened-to in US politics. But Silver didn't develop his journalism through the traditional Harvard Crimson and Washington Post route, wearing out shoe leather on the campaign trail and drinking in Capitol Hill bars with interns and advisers. He has a background in economics and started his career modelling baseball statistics. His prediction modelling for the 2008 election gave him remarkable accuracy and elevated his blog to a sought-after source of political wisdom. A deal with the New York Times sealed his rise.</p> <p>His prominence has unsettled those he disrupts, and the possibility that he might be wrong encouraged the sceptics into open hostility. In his new book The Signal and the Noise, Silver lays bare how political pundits failed to predict accurately the scale of the Obama victory. Joe Scarborough, a commentator for MSNBC, and a former Republican congressman, levelled his guns at Silver last week, saying that he was an \"ideologue\", a far more insulting term in US journalism than in British, and that the election was in effect a \"coin toss\".</p> <p>At its most basic level, this argument goes beyond left and right \u2013 it is about a new emerging school of journalism challenging the status quo. Journalism delivered through lovely prose and burnished anecdote, developed through access traded, sometimes for truth, is under threat from spreadsheets and the numeracy of a different elite. All journalism in one way or another is about the performance of information; presenting, polishing, contextualising and reporting. Silver's performance is through numbers and methodology; those left outside it attack it, without acknowledging this might be a world where both can thrive.</p> <p>As of Friday Silver had Obama at an 81% likelihood of winning the election. The polls themselves, it seems, were disrupted by the politics of Sandy. And this was something no one predicted.</p>",

  "<p>Ahead of the Israeli elections next January, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/25/us-israel-elections-idUSBRE89O18Y20121025\" title=\"\">a merger</a> between the parties of the prime minister, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/binyamin-netanyahu\" title=\"\">Binyamin Netanyahu</a>, and the foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, has been announced. They are to contest the elections on a joint list, intending to become the largest bloc in the Knesset.</p> <p>The move is seen as an achievement for both men. Netanyahu was shaken by the recent decline in the popularity of his Likud party at the rate of one seat per week. More specifically, his apprehension revolved around the possible return of Ehud Olmert, the former Israeli prime minister, as leader of an opposition alliance consisting of Tzipi Livni, the former foreign minister; Shaul Mofaz, leader of Kadima; and Yair Labed, a rising political star.</p> <p>Netanyahu's avowed objective is to assemble a major political force that would guarantee his re-election and ensure his dominance of the Israeli right. Lieberman is the main beneficiary of this alliance: it guarantees power for his party, Yisrael Beiteinu, and under the agreement, Lieberman can choose to run whatever ministry he desires, including the important ministry of defence. He will gain political legitimacy and be transformed from a mere participant in a coalition government to a key player. If in recent years the government has been a construct of Netanyahu and Ehud Barak, the defence minister, the next government will be a Netanyahu-Lieberman one. Lieberman can also contest Likud's leadership after Netanyahu.</p> <p>The alliance reflects a lunge to the right, at a time of greater extremism in Israeli politics. Previously, Lieberman was very much on the margins. When he became minister of transport, a minister in the Labour party resigned, refusing to sit at the same table with him.</p> <p>After that, Lieberman became the foreign minister. Many thought this would provoke the ire of the international community. But he was warmly received in European capitals. If one had said 10 years ago that Lieberman would become foreign minister, one would have been accused of ignorance, if not of hostility and incitement against Israel.</p> <p>Among the obvious outcomes of this new coalition is the fact that Likud has become more extremist, and Lieberman more influential and more dangerous. A few months ago Lieberman called for the toppling of President <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/mahmoud-abbas\" title=\"\">Mahmoud Abbas</a>, despite the fact that the Palestinian leader has maintained the peace in the shadow of the occupation, and continues to pursue negotiations \u2013 even in the absence of an Israeli partner. Lieberman also called for economic, political and security sanctions on the Palestinian Authority after it began diplomatic moves to gain UN recognition for a Palestinian state.</p> <p>Lieberman has espoused policies hostile to Arab citizens of Israel, who constitute 17% of the population. The slogan of his party is \"No citizenship without loyalty\"; he seeks to oblige Arabs citizens to declare loyalty to the Zionist state as a condition for citizenship, including the right to vote and become members of the Knesset. As the danger of racism depends not only on its callousness but on its power and influence, this coalition at the heart of government suggests a sharp rise in levels of racism and a dramatic decline in democracy.</p> <p>Central to Lieberman's politics is official recognition for the annexation of Jerusalem and the illegal Jewish settlements, in exchange for the transfer of major Arab population centres in Israel to Palestine. Altogether, Lieberman's aim is to make the citizenship of Palestinian Arabs conditional and temporary. Ultimately, this could result in a pure Jewish state, free of Arab citizens.</p> <p>When J\u00f6rg Haider and his extreme right party entered the Austrian government, several European countries imposed sanctions. Lieberman is far more dangerous than Haider. His stature is proof that extremism has come to dominate in Israel. Should the kind of politics that are rejected in Europe be accommodated in the Holy&#xa0;Land?</p> <p>The last government and Knesset, whose term has just ended, was the most extremist so far; in the upcoming elections the situation is likely to change for the worse. So what should we do? I believe trying to persuade Netanyahu and his government to adopt more moderate policies is a waste of time and effort. The only way to ensure change is through pressure and sanctions on the Israeli government. Netanyahu's political conduct shows that he bows only when confronted. Whoever wants a just peace and to prevent looming wars, whoever wants to put an end to the crimes committed by occupation, whoever wants to combat racism, must help in imposing sanctions.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Comments on this article are set to remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight</em></p>",
  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, is facing widespread condemnation and anger in the Palestinian territories and abroad after he publicly waived his right to return to live in the town from which his family was forced to flee in 1948, a repudiation of huge significance for Palestinian refugees.</p> <p>After his image was burned in refugee camps in Gaza, Abbas rejected accusations that he had conceded one of the most emotional and visceral issues on the Palestinian agenda, the demand by millions of refugees to return to their former homes in what is now Israel.</p> <p>He insisted that comments made in an interview with an Israeli television channel were selectively quoted and the remarks were his personal stance, rather than a change of policy.</p> <p>Abbas told Channel 2 he accepted he had no right to live in Safed, the town of his birth, from which his family was forced to flee in 1948 when Abbas was 13.</p> <p>\"I visited Safed before once, he said. \"But I want to see Safed. It's my right to see it, but not to live there.\"</p> <p>Referring to the internationally-recognised pre-1967 border, he went on: \"Palestine now for me is '67 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. This is now and forever ... This is Palestine for me. I am a refugee, but I am living in Ramallah. I believe that the West Bank and Gaza is Palestine and the other parts are Israel.\"</p> <p>The comments sparked protests in Gaza, where people in refugee camps burned images of the Palestinian president. Abbas was denounced on Twitter by pro-Palestinian activists.</p> <p>Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas ruler in Gaza, said the issue was not about Abbas's right to return to Safed but \"the rights of 6 million Palestinians\".</p> <p>He said in a statement: \"No one has the right, whoever he is \u2013 a common man or president, organisation, a government or authority \u2013 to give up an inch of Palestinian land.\"</p> <p>Sami Abu Zuhri, a Hamas spokesman, said the president's statement did \"not represent in any way the views of the Palestinian people\".</p> <p>The \"right of return\" is one of the most intractable issues in talks between the Israelis and Palestinians for a resolution to their decades-old conflict. The Palestinians have historically demanded that all those who fled or were expelled from their homes in the period around the formation of the state of Israel in 1948, and their descendants, must be allowed to return to their former homes.</p> <p>About 5 million Palestinians are registered as refugees in the Palestinian territories and abroad.</p> <p>Israel rejects their demand, saying that such a move would spell the end of the Jewish state.</p> <p>Most international diplomats and observers believe that a settlement to the conflict is likely to involve a symbolic number of Palestinian refugees being given the right to return.</p> <p>Following the broadcast of the interview, Israel's president, Shimon Peres, said Abbas's comments were a \"brave and important public declaration\". In a statement, he said Abbas had shown he was \"a real partner for peace\" and that he understood \"the solution to the Palestinian refugee issue cannot be in Israel's territory and to the detriment of Israel's character\".</p> <p>Israel's defence, minister Ehud Barak, described Abbas's remarks as courageous and clear.</p> <p>But Israel's prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu. dismissed the comments, saying that the Palestinian president had different messages for different audiences. \"There is no connection between [his] statements and his actual actions,\" he said, calling for Abbas to return to negotiations.</p> <p>Palestinian sources played down the row, saying Abbas's comments had been misconstrued. One suggested the president had been ill-prepared for the interview and it had been a mistake to agree to conduct it in English, a language in which Abbas is not fluent.</p> <p>Ghassan Khatib, an academic at Bir Zeit university in the West Bank and a former Palestinian Authority spokesman, said Abbas had not suggested a change in the official position. \"This is an optional right. If an individual refugee does not wish to return, he will be free not to return. We all know that all Palestinians are not going to return. Some understand this, some do not.\"</p> <p>In the interview, Abbas also said that, while he was president, there would be \"no third armed intifada [uprising against Israel]. Never.\"</p> <p>He said: \"We don't want to use terror. We don't want to use force. We don't want to use weapons. We want to use diplomacy. We want to use politics. We want to use negotiations. We want to use peaceful resistance. That's it.\" He has said that Palestinian negotiators are willing to resume talks with Israel following the submission of a request, expected later this month, to the UN general assembly for recognition as a \"non-member state\".</p> <p>Israel and the US are vehemently opposed to the move, which is expected to be passed by a majority of the UN's 193 member states.</p>",
  "<p>Veronica Romero was belting it out for Mitt Romney. Her band, Punto y Coma, flipped between Cuban and Puerto Rican numbers for a crowd of Republican supporters in Kissimmee, a central Florida town next to Disneyworld where a surge in Hispanic residents since the last presidential election is shaking up old assumptions about the Latino vote in an important swing state.</p> <p>The Cuban songs played to a community that has for decades defined Latino politics in Florida as solidly pro-Republican. The Puerto Rican music was an acknowledgement that hegemony is increasingly under challenge from Latino migrants whose votes are up for grabs.</p> <p>Romero is Puerto Rican and for Romney. But when she talks about the election she sounds much like a Barack Obama supporter four years ago.</p> <p>\"We are tired of the same old. We are looking forward,\" she said. \"We were looking for a change and we didn't get it. Especially the economy. We need more job opportunities. We are looking to work.\"</p> <p>Opinion polls show Obama commanding a sizeable lead among Latino voters across the US who support him about two to one against Romney. But Florida is different.</p> <p>The bulk of the Hispanic population in US border states to the west has Mexican roots. Florida's Latino politics has for half a century been dominated by Cubans who fled Fidel Castro's rule and their descendants, and they have generally been solid Republicans because of their hostility to communism.</p> <p>But years of immigration from South and Central America, and more recently migrants from Puerto Rico, has not only contributed to a dramatic change in demographics \u2013 with Latinos rising from one-tenth of the state's population 30 years ago to nearly one quarter today \u2013 but has shifted the ground in this year's presidential election. And unlike many other new arrivals in Florida, people born in Puerto Rico are Americans citizens and can vote, even if their island is not a US state.</p> <p>\"The Puerto Rican vote in Florida is up for grabs,\" said Puerto Rico's Republican governor, Luis Fortuno. \"Puerto Ricans in Florida tend to be very conservative socially. If they are second or third generation moving south from New York, that's different. Those coming straight from Puerto Rico are social conservatives for whom issues such as high taxes are very important.\"</p> <p>Democrats say some of that is true. \"The Puerto Ricans like Romney because they are conservative,\" said Nicole Murillo, secretary of the Democratic party's Hispanic caucus in Kissimmee. \"They don't like abortion. They don't like gay marriage. But Romney as a person who can fix the economy \u2013 very few believe in that.</p> <p>\"When I hear from Latinos that they're not going to vote for Obama because he hasn't fixed the economy, I say: are you going to vote for Romney who only cares about the rich? I say look at it this way: they're both bad but you have to look at the one that is less bad. They say that makes sense.\"</p> <p>There are about one million Cuban Americans in Florida. <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/10/28/3070930_p3/miami-dade-commission-term-limits.html#storylink=cpy\">Opinion polls show about three out of four of them back Romney</a>, in large part because they do not believe Obama has been tough enough on Cuba's communist leadership.</p> <p>But there are also now about 850,000 Puerto Ricans resident in Florida. Many of the new arrivals have settled in Orlando and neighbouring Osceola County, where Kissimmee is the largest town. Latinos now make up 40% of residents and the sharp rise in the number of Puerto Ricans led to the area getting a new congressional district this year.</p> <p>Tammy Celeste, the chair of Kissimmee's Republican party, said that knocking on doors campaigning, she hears a lot of disillusionment with Obama.</p> <p>\"The guy promised them change. He promised them the world and they fell for it,\" she said. \"There's a lot of them that's changing their politics. Mostly they are conservative. They believe in what we believe in \u2013 less government, family. But they just need to be told in Spanish what we stand for. There are those who are much more favourable to [Obama] but they're the ones who don't want to work.\"</p> <p>Murillo, an immigrant from Colombia and a substitute teacher, said she, too, hears the distress over jobs when she's campaigning on streets lined with closed restaurants and shops plastered with \"For Rent\" signs. But that does not necessarily translate into support for Romney.</p> <p>\"In this area, Disney is the biggest employer. They've been cutting a lot of people,\" she said. \"Most of the time we worry more about jobs; how we are going to provide for our families. One of the things that is happening in central Florida, people are having two jobs. That was difficult but now some people have three or four part time jobs in order to provide for your family. People don't look at Romney and think he is going to bring more secure jobs or better pay.\"</p> <p>The Romney campaign is hitting the unemployment issue hard in adverts targeted at Latino voters. It has also bought blocks of air time on a Spanish-language liberal talk radio show during which surrogates get to argue the Republican candidate's case with a sceptical host and Obama supporter, Fernando Miguel Negron.</p> <p>Obama scored points with some Puerto Ricans in particular, and Latinos in general, by appointing Sonia Sotomayor, who is of Puerto Rican heritage, to the US supreme court. Two former Democratic party governors of Puerto Rico, Carlos Romero Barcel\u00f3 and Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez Col\u00f3n \u2013 who are renowned as bitter rivals on the island \u2013 joined forces in Kissimmee to endorse the president.</p> <p>Obama has tried to woo the Cuban American community with an endorsement from Cristina Saralegui, a talk show host sometimes described as the Oprah Winfrey of Spanish-language television in Florida. Saralegui, who arrived in Florida as a child refugee from Cuba, says she is backing Obama because he \"understands the Hispanic community and has supported it unconditionally\".</p> <p>Saralegui joined Michelle Obama in an advert where the first lady said it was important to reelect her husband because of the promise of immigration reform and preserving achievements such as healthcare and widening access to higher education.</p> <p>But while immigration plays significantly as an issue with Latino voters in other parts of the US \u2013 and Obama said in an interview with Spanish-language television that his failure to pass comprehensive immigration reform is his biggest failure to date \u2013 it does not have the same weight in Florida.</p> <p>Puerto Ricans, who have automatic American citizenship, have the right to vote if they live in the US, and most Cubans who make it to Florida are generally granted legal residence.</p> <p>But Republican leaders' attitudes toward immigration do have an impact in Florida, where Latinos are generally more sympathetic to the plight of the undocumented even if it is not so much of a voting issue. Murillo said Republican-sponsored legislation, such as anti-immigrant statutes in Arizona and Alabama, reinforce the perception that the party is hostile to minorities.</p> <p>\"I haven't heard people talking about immigration,\" she said. \"It's not a big issue. But people do talk about the Republicans and how they want self-deportation and to bring the Arizona laws to Florida. They want to make the only language English, but we raise our kids bilingual,\" she said.</p> <p>Romero said that while immigration is not a voting issue for her, she thinks the Republicans have called it wrong. \"People have sympathy for illegal immigrants. I don't see them lying in a hammock, getting a suntan. Many of them work three times as hard as an American,\" she said.</p> <p>Which puts her at odds with Romney's views. \"I think it's fair to say there's always room for change. We need to continue to review the policy,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>President Obama has run one of the most secretive administrations in history. His commitment to a free press and free speech in the digital age is, at best, limited. Yet, Mitt Romney's record tells you that he'd make Obama look like a paragon of openness.</p> <p>Let's start with Obama, whose performance has been just north of abysmal on these matters. Let's give him credit for one major initiative that has been on the positive side: the administration's <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/open\">\"Open Government Initiative\"</a>, which was a polar opposite to the Bush era's default condition of secrecy. While it hasn't remotely kept his 2009 promise of \"creating an unprecedented level of openness in government\", it has led to the public availability of more data than we've seen in the past. And <a href=\"http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2011/12/06/data-released-via-the-open-government-directive-has-been-put-to-good-use/\">that data has been used in any number of ways by any number of people and organizations</a> to shine some light on our society and its government.</p> <p>But the Sunlight Foundation, which focuses exclusively on opening data for public use, has <a href=\"http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2011/12/07/obamas-open-government-directive-two-years-on/\">made clear how many departments and agencies have blown off the White House directives</a>, and how there's been no penalty for their obfuscations. At best, as the foundation puts it, the administration's record is mixed.</p> <p>On secrecy in other respects, the Obama crowd has not been significantly different from the George W Bush administration, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/02/obama-civil-liberties-history\">as Glenn Greenwald has described</a>. The White House and agencies have taken an even more expansive view of their right to withhold even the most basic information about what government is doing in our names and with our money. Two examples among many: American drones, which are killing people in a variety of undeclared war zones, don't officially exist. And the Obama justice department has made the breathtakingly Orwellian argument that the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/29/opinion/surveillance-and-accountability.html\">public can't go to court over government's illegal, pervasive electronic surveillance because it's a state secret</a>.</p> <p>When pressed hard on free speech and a free press, the Obama administration takes a dim view of both. The logic of <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/12/06/war_on_speech/\">its attacks on WikiLeaks</a> \u2013 public and secret \u2013 could be used against any major journalism organization that solicits and publishes leaked information. The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/sunday-review/a-high-tech-war-on-leaks.html\">Obama government has prosecuted more leakers, or whistleblowers,</a> than all the previous ones combined, and has spied on journalists in the process.</p> <p>Free speech in a digital era is about data networks. Here, too, the incumbent has, at best, a mixed record. The White House has talked a reasonably good game, as well, on keeping the internet open and not letting the telecom industry, Hollywood and other corporate interests lock it down to serve their own narrow purposes. In almost every case that matters, however, the administration's actions don't support those words.</p> <p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), with its Democratic majority, adopted rules promoting network neutrality \u2013 the idea that the broadband duopoly of cable and phone companies should not be allowed to favor one kind of data traffic over another, with a few exceptions aimed at network management. But the FCC's rules for mobile data, which is increasingly the way people use the internet, allow the carriers to manipulate and limit traffic pretty much at will, and the regulations for wired lines \u2013 which the industry has challenged in any case \u2013 are full of loopholes.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Obama government has almost always sided with the \"copyright cartel\" in its wish to take control of the internet. There's been one notable exception: the administration's belated, but welcome refusal to support the odious Sopa (Stop Online Privacy Act) earlier this year. But the government has repeatedly acted in ways that threaten free speech online, including its theft \u2013 this is the right word \u2013 of any number of domains it has decided to take down from the internet (after \"intellectual property\" holders complain and with no input from the alleged offenders).</p> <p>One was a hip-hop blog that got its domain back a year after its theft by the government, with <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/12/ice-admits-months-long-seizure-of-music-blog-was-a-mistake.ars\">not even a pretense of an apology</a>. And the administration has supported \u2013 in many cases, as the principal author \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/10/ceta-replicates-acta\">secretive</a> <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/tpp\">treaty</a> <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/acta\">negotiations</a> that would create Sopa-like, and worse, laws via backdoor methods.</p> <p>At the same time, the Obama justice department has repeatedly made clear that it wants ever more surveillance powers. This what every government does, no matter who runs it, but Obama once claimed to be in favor of civil liberties \u2013 and then broke almost every promise in this arena (with the one exception of gay rights).</p> <p>All of this \u2013 and there's much more \u2013 would make someone who believes in open government, free speech and an open internet long for a better candidate. Unfortunately, the other major-party candidate this year would almost certainly be worse in every way.</p> <p>Romney's penchant for secrecy goes beyond his refusal to disclose his own finances \u2013 thereby denying voters a chance to see how the man who claims his business record would make him a good president has actually behaved with his money. He and his associates hid or disposed of documents that would shed light on his two other major professional achievements: <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/politics/articles/2012/07/24/after_romney_pledged_transparent_olympics_key_documents_were_destroyed/?page=full\">his Olympics leadership in Utah</a> and <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/12/06/questions-raised-about-romneys-disposal-of-records/\">his administration as governor of Massachusetts</a>. </p> <p>Romney is against network neutrality \u2013 in favor of an internet that big companies control for their own purposes. His party wants to wage a war on pornography, even though that would be a proxy war on free speech itself. And he's even more hostile to civil liberties \u2013 except the right create home arsenals of firearms \u2013 than Obama, which is saying something.</p> <p>I wish the press had paid more attention to these matters in the past few years, or at least during the campaign, but in an era when journalists have abandoned even the pretense of doing their jobs, that's a forlorn hope. I'll have much more to say on the performance of the media in my next column.</p>",
  "<p>New York City and surrounding metro areas have other things to worry about right now, but local newspapers Newsday and the Daily News came out for Mitt Romney on Sunday (joining the New York Post, which predictably <a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/mitt_will_get_the_jobs_done_9hpevJPvBnMgJ0GMyGb0GO\">backed Rommey a week ago</a>).

People are not thinking about climate change as far away and in the future any more,\" said Daniel Souweine of Forecast the Facts.</p> <p>\"It's shifting from a kind of scientific conversation to a moral one.\"</p> <p>The group, which focuses on pushing back against climate change denial, has been raising money off Romney's convention speech.</p> <p>It plans to run the climate ad in the Washington DC suburbs of northern Virginia, a strongly Democratic area in the battleground state, and around Columbus, Ohio, which typically is a swing district.</p> <p>Souweine said the group hoped to expand to New Hampshire, where Romney plans to hold his final rally on Monday, or to North Carolina.</p> <p>The prospect of going on the air in North Carolina has excited some activists. Last June, state officials voted to ban discussion of future sea-level rise, in what was seen as an attempt to stop debate on global warming.</p> <p>After Sandy, campaigners hope such a posture will become politically untenable.</p> <p>\"We cannot risk having leaders in Washington who turn a blind eye to the threat of climate change and the devastating impact it's having,\" Gene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservation Voters said.</p>",
  "<p>Now that Sandy has exacted a steep toll in lives and property, the question is unavoidable: why do so many people in America refuse to take climate science seriously?</p> <p>I am not assuming that Sandy was the direct consequence of human-caused climate change. But with this fresh evidence of the impact of climate issues on real people, how is it possible for anyone to think that thousands of scientists around the world are engaged in an elaborate hoax? </p> <p>The standard reply is that some powerful organizations \u2013 above all, in the fossil fuel industry \u2013 think that they can benefit from misleading the public, and have funded a successful disinformation campaign. There is a lot of truth to this answer, but it isn't the whole truth. </p> <p>For the average climate science denier in the street (and there are a lot of them on some streets), there is often little correlation between the vehemence of their denials and the so-called \"facts\" at their disposal. The average Chuck is like Chuck Norris, who has <a href=\"http://townhall.com/columnists/chucknorris/2009/12/08/chestnuts_roasting_on_a_copenhagen_fire/page/full/\">claimed that climate science is a \"trick\"</a>. Not an innocent mistake, not a systemic bias, but a premeditated fraud.</p> <p>Climate science denial needs disinformation to survive, but it has its feet firmly planted in a part of American culture. That culture draws on lots of different sources. But if you want to understand it, you need to understand something about America's religious landscape. </p> <p>Take a look at some of the most recent initiatives in the climate science denial wars. In Louisiana, Tennessee, New Hampshire and other states, legislatures have either passed or put forward bills intended to disinform secondary-school students about climate science. Sure, they paper over the assault on education with claims that they only want to teach \"both sides\" of the issue and encourage \"critical thinking\". But, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/feb/15/leaked-heartland-institute-documents-climate-scepticism\">leaked documents made clear in at least one instance</a>, the ultimate purpose is to produce a young generation of \"skeptics\" whose views on climate science will happily coincide with those of the fossil fuel industry.</p> <p>Who is behind these programs of de-education?</p> <p>The group writing much of the legislation is the <a href=\"http://www.alec.org\">American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec)</a>, a \"nonpartisan\" consortium of state legislators and business interests that gets plenty of money from the usual suspects. But the legislation has also received vital support from groups associated with the religious right. For example, the perversely named Louisiana Science Education Act, which opens the door to climate science denial in the classroom, was co-authored by the Discovery Institute, a Seattle-based creationist thinktank. That act also received <a href=\"http://lasciencecoalition.org/2012/01/05/gutting-bese-policy-untold-story/\">crucial support from the Alliance Defending Freedom</a>, the well-funded Christian legal advocacy group that has described itself as \"a servant organization that provides the resources that will keep the door open for the spread of the Gospel\", and which promotes a radical religious agenda in public schools. </p> <p>What does religion have to do with climate science? Radical religious activists promote the anti-science bills, in part, because they also seek to undermine the teaching of evolution \u2013 another issue that supposedly has \"two sides\", so schools should \"teach the controversy\". Now, you don't have to believe that Earth was created in six hectic days in order to be skeptical about climate science, but a large number of climate science deniers also happen to be evolution deniers. </p> <p>What exactly is the theology of climate science denial? The <a href=\"http://www.cornwallalliance.org\">Cornwall Alliance</a> \u2013 a coalition whose list of signatories could double as a directory of major players in the religious right \u2013 has a produced a <a href=\"http://www.cornwallalliance.org/articles/read/an-evangelical-declaration-on-global-warming/\">declaration asserting</a>, as a matter of <em>theology</em>, that \"there is no convincing scientific evidence that human contribution to greenhouse gases is causing dangerous global warming.\"</p> <p>It also tells us \u2013 on the firm foundation of Holy Scriptures \u2013 that policies intended to slow the pace of climate change represent a \"dangerous expansion of government control over private life\". It also alerts us that the environmental movement is \"un-Biblical\" \u2013 indeed, a new and false religion. If the Cornwall Declaration seems like a tough read, you can get what you need from the organization's DVD series: \"Resisting the Green Dragon: A Biblical Response to one of the Greatest Deceptions of our Day.\"</p> <p>Now, this isn't the theology of every religion in America, or of every strain of Christianity; not by a long stretch. Most Christians accept climate science and believe in protecting the environment, and many of them do so for religious as well as scientific reasons. But theirs is not the theology that holds sway in the upper reaches of the Republican party, or moves your average climate science denier Chuck. As <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/07/rick-santorum-global-warming-hoax_n_1260168.html\">Rick Santorum explained at an energy summit in Colorado</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We were put on this Earth as creatures of God to have dominion over the Earth \u2026 for our benefit not for the Earth's benefit.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Why does this theology of science denial have such power? For one thing, it gives its adherents something to throw back in the face of all those obnoxious \"elites\", which they think are telling them what to do with their lives. There's no need to master the facts if all you need is to learn a few words of scripture. </p> <p>But, perhaps, more to the point is that this kind of religion works for Chuck because it allows him to disguise the extraordinary selfishness of his position in a cloak of sanctimony. Translated into the kind of language that you can take to the shopping mall, it says that God wants you to squeeze whatever you can out of the earth \u2013 and to hell with the grandkids.</p> <p>I hear plenty of cynicism about the choice facing people this Tuesday, 6 November. Some say that it really doesn't matter who gets elected. It is true that Obama has largely kept climate change out of the campaign. But it is delusional to imagine that Obama is just the same as Romney and the Republican party on this issue. Paul Ryan is <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/08/11/677051/meet-paul-ryan-climate-denier-conspiracy-theorist-koch-acolyte/\">on record as a world-class climate science denier</a>. <a href=\"http://www.desmogblog.com/2012/10/31/romney-aide-andrea-saul-denies-climate-connection-hurricane-katrina-sandy-next\">Mitt Romney's press secretary</a> has been a shill for oil companies.</p> <p>Romney's proposals on energy policy and climate issues, so far as they can be discerned, are indistinguishable from those of the fossil fuel industry. And anyone who thinks that Republican party policies won't be informed by some of that old-time religion simply hasn't been listening to what its candidates have to say about women, reproductive rights, and what they speciously call \"religious liberty\".</p> <p>There is a choice. And even if <em>you</em> don't think it matters, your grandkids will.</p>",
  "<p>It has become fashionable to suggest there is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/01/opinion/two-candidates-one-foreign-policy.html\" title=\"\">little difference between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney</a> on the main international challenges facing the US and its allies, and that few real changes in American foreign policy will result should the Republican win. Such assessments are dangerously shortsighted.</p> <p>Romney's whole approach is underpinned by delusional nostalgia for the 1980s, a harking back to the cold war era, when the US believed it led the world in facing down the \"evil empire\" (the Soviet Union), when whole continents were divided into tame client nations or rogue states, and when western (meaning American) values were promoted as a nonpareil paradigm for all to follow.</p> <p>Like most conservative Republicans, Romney's No 1 hero is Ronald Reagan, president from 1981 to 1989. Romney's philosophy and vocabulary draw heavily on the Gipper. Hence his headline theme of \"A New American Century\", his insistence on America's unique international leadership role, and his Reaganesque belief in the US as a moral beacon offering a superior guiding light to the world \u2013 the \"shining city on a hill\" of Reagan's 1976 convention speech that launched the so-called Reagan revolution.</p> <p>\"This is what makes America exceptional: It is not just the character of our country \u2013 it is the record of our accomplishments. America has a proud history of strong, confident, principled global leadership \u2013 a history that has been written by patriots of both parties. That is America at its best,\" Romney <a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/blog/foreign-policy-address-virginia-military-institute\" title=\"\">told the Virginia Military Institute</a> last month.</p> <p>\"It is the responsibility of our president to use America's great power to shape history \u2013 not to lead from behind,\" he added with a sneer aimed at Obama. Evidently relishing the role of Reagan retread, Romney has been busily colouring in the world map to the simplistic, neo-imperial design favoured by his late mentor. Hence <a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/issues/russia\" title=\"\">Vladimir Putin's Russia is resurrected as a prime foe</a>. \"Russia is a destabilising force on the world stage. It needs to be tempered,\" Romney says.</p> <p>Despite recent attempts at moderation, the Romney doctrine also posits confrontation over co-operation with China, a communist rival whose economy will outgrow the US by the end of the decade. It is thus a fitting heir to the \"evil empire\". Tariff wars over Chinese imports may be just the start. Romney appears to see the western Pacific as a <a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/issues/china-east-asia\" title=\"\">whole new cold war-style conflict zone</a>.</p> <p>\"China must be discouraged from attempting to intimidate or dominate neighbouring states... [I] will implement a strategy that makes the path of regional hegemony for China far more costly than the alternative path of becoming a responsible partner in the international system,\" he writes on his website.</p> <p>Reprising the rogue state theme, Romney promises a tougher line on Iran's nuclear activities (which he insists must halt completely); says he will arm Syria's rebels; threatens a virtual blockade of nuclear-armed North Korea; vows to avenge war crimes allegedly committed by Sudan's leadership; and warns the Palestinians that any attempt to assert their statehood without Israel's prior agreement will bring heavy penalties.</p> <p>According to Romney's manifesto, this will be underwritten by a massive expansion of defence spending, again echoing Reagan's 1980s. \"It was American resolve and power that helped to liberate the captive nations of eastern Europe and precipitate the collapse of the USSR. It is America today that patrols the global commons and keeps them safe for trade and commerce,\" <a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/issues/national-defense\" title=\"\">Romney proclaims</a>.</p> <p>To achieve this end and ignoring record federal debt, Romney plans to add $2tn (\u00a31.24tn) over the next decade to the Pentagon's already enormous $711bn annual budget. At the same time, he proposes a supra-national, worldwide \"Reagan Economic Zone\" (sic) to extend the benefits of free enterprise and open markets to every corner of the globe. Rarely have guns and butter been so blatantly linked in a policy platform.</p> <p>Obama, in contrast, is more prosaic. He promises a prolongation of the cautious, pragmatic-aspirational foreign policy that characterised his first term and disappointed many supporters. Specifically, this includes tight focus on the Afghanistan-Pakistan withdrawal, ongoing global operations against al-Qaida and linked jihadi groups, careful management of the Arab spring and Iran dossiers, new emphasis on Asia and denuclearisation, and global alliance-building.</p> <p>But an Obama second term would also mean reinforcement of a refreshing intellectual recalibration that is the antithesis of Romney's old world imperialism and more closely matched to evolving global power relations.</p> <p>\"Obama is neither an out-of-his-depth naif nor a reactive realist. He has been trying to shape a new liberal global order with the US still in the lead but sharing more responsibilities and burdens with others where possible or necessary,\" <a href=\"http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/137516/martin-indyk-kenneth-lieberthal-and-michael-e-ohanlon/scoring-obamas-foreign-policy\" title=\"\">wrote Martin Indyk and others in Foreign Affairs</a>.</p> <p>\"The Obama approach has been relatively non-ideological in practice but informed by a realistic overarching sense of the US role in the world in the 21st century. The tone has been neither that of American triumphalism and exceptionalism nor one of American decline. On balance, this approach has been effective.\"</p>",
  "<p>Leading Republicans in a key Florida battleground have condemned Mitt Romney's campaign for writing off African American voters and attitudes toward minorities that they say have cost the party crucial support.</p> <p>Art Wood, chairman of the Republican party in Hillsborough County, a diverse area of about one million people and one of the most heavily contested regions of the state, said his party's presidential candidate failed to even try to win over black voters.</p> <p>\"Romney did a really poor job with minorities. That was my greatest disappointment. You'd go on to his website and he'd have a column for outreach. You clicked on that and there was Catholics for Romney, Democrats for Romney, fishermen for Romney. You never saw blacks or African Americans for Romney until four weeks ago,\" Wood said.</p> <p>\"I think it's the big frigging smart guys at the top who think they know how to run a campaign, and they probably just wrote off the African American vote. Romney did a really poor job with the African Americans. They're in many ways like Hispanics. They favour traditional marriage, they go to church regularly, they're suffering worse from unemployment.\"</p> <p>Wood was backed by a Republican contender for the US Congress in the area, EJ Otero, who is not even including his party affiliation on his election posters and literature because he thinks it will harm his chances.</p> <p>\"I think it's true but not only with the Romney campaign. That's a problem with the Republican party as a whole, and not just with African Americans. Hispanics, too. The Republican party has written off African Americans and Hispanics for the past 20 years and it needs to change,\" he said.</p> <p>Otero, a former air force colonel who served in Iraq and is of Cuban descent, said part of his party's problem is how it discusses issues that are important to minorities such as immigration and welfare.</p> <p>\"I do believe we've got to get off the emotional argument of: the border, the border, the border. We need to control the border so white slavery stops and narco trafficking. But when it comes to the people, we're talking about community,\" he said. \"There's also this myth that all poor people want here is handouts. They don't. All they want is the jobs they used to have.\"</p> <p>Otero acknowledged that he has distanced himself from his own party. \"I put my ideas. Nowhere in there does it say I'm a Republican. That's not helpful,\" he said.</p> <p>African American and Latino voters waiting outside the C Blythe Andrews library in Tampa to cast their ballot in early voting said Republican attitudes towards the less well off, and even \"fear\" of a Romney presidency, is driving people in the area to the polls.</p> <p>\"This is a serious election,\" said Tonya Lewis who runs a charity, Children With A Vision, to help underprivileged young people in school. \"There's been so much negativity from the Republicans. Mitt Romney scares the hell out of me. Romney can't relate to the people, he has no connection to the people. People are really afraid because if you get somebody whose worth millions of dollars, how can they know?\"</p> <p>Betty Reed, a Democratic party representative in the Florida legislature, said that turnout for early voting in the area is so high that she was arranging buses to move people to less busy polling stations.</p> <p>\"Voters in this area support the president but they're turning out to keep Romney out. His campaign played a big role. He went to the NAACP meeting and he talked about how he wanted to get rid of Planned Parenthood, things that are good for poor people. He didn't talk about what he would do for us,\" she said. \"Race is also a part of it. There's more than one issue but we know some people did not want Obama to be successful as president and we know why.\"</p> <p>Vivien Warren, who was brought from Cuba to the US as a child, was among those at the library voting for Obama. She said that the Republican-controlled Florida legislature's cutting in half of the number of days early voting, along with attempts to introduce new photo identification requirements at polling places that were struck down by a federal court as discriminatory, also drove people to vote.</p> <p>\"There's been a lot of talk among people about voter suppression. People are angry. How dare they? They're trying to prevent us from voting,\" she said.</p> <p>\"People are also angry that Romney and the Republicans have been disrespectful of the office of the president. The way Romney talked to him at the debate. People think that's about race. They don't want a black person in the White House.\"</p> <p>The legislature's removal of the last Sunday before the general election as an early voting day \u2013 a day when many African Americans went to the polls after church \u2013 mobilised religious leaders to launch a campaign, Souls to the Polls, to get black people to vote the previous Sunday instead. Vote monitors say it was successful and that turnout in minority districts will at least match that of 2008.</p>",
  "<p>The Great Recession has been hard on world leaders. Gordon Brown, Nicolas Sarkozy and Silvio Berlusconi are all history. Angela Merkel has her date with destiny next autumn, and Barack Obama has hison Tuesday.</p> <p>US political history would point to Obama joining the list of recent political casualties. He was billed as the heir to Roosevelt when elected during the worst slump since the 1930s, but he has been no FDR. Recovery has been weak, unemployment slow to come down, inequality has got worse and vested interests left untouched. If the Republicans had been able to put up a candidate with even a hint of Ronald Reagan's charisma, Obama would be going the way of Jimmy Carter.</p> <p>To be sure, Obama has not had it easy. He has been faced with venomous opposition from Republicans in Congress determined to obstruct the White House every inch of the way. What's more, the poor state of the economy over the past four years largely reflects stuff that happened before Obama became president.</p> <p>It was George W Bush who took the budget surpluses Bill Clinton bequeathed to him and turned them into whopping deficits; Bush who was in the White House when the biggest property bubble in US history was allowed to inflate; and Bush who was president when Lehman Brothers went bust, sending the global economy into a tailspin. By the time of Obama's inauguration in early 2009, the profile for global industrial production and trade was similar to that in the early stages of the Great Depression.</p> <p>The recession arrived at a time when the US was structurally weak. Stephen King, the chief economist at HSBC, has noted that in the past decade growth in the world's biggest economy has consistently failed to live up to expectations, while inflation has been higher.</p> <p>Growth in the 2000s was lower than in the 1990s, which in turn saw slower expansion than the 1980s. The great boost to growth that was supposed to come from the IT revolution did not materialise, mainly because the spoils of growth were so unevenly divided.</p> <p>Real median incomes have been virtually flat for decades, with top-ups from tax credits less generous than in Europe. That left Americans reliant on the drug of debt to finance their consumption habit.</p> <p>Recoveries from recessions that are rooted in financial crises always take time, and this one has been made still more sluggish by high oil prices, which have taken spending power away from consumers and raised business costs.</p> <p>Central banks respond to downturns by cutting interest rates in the hope that cheaper borrowing will encourage spending and investment, but when the banks are licking their wounds and reluctant to lend, credit flows dry up even when interest rates drop close to zero. Hence the willingness of the Federal Reserve to try unconventional measures such as quantitative easing \u2013 creating electronic money \u2013 in the hope that it can get spending going again. Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Fed, says QE has prevented an even deeper downturn, but one side-effect may have been speculation in commodity markets that has driven up the cost of food and fuel.</p> <p>The case for Obama is that he has done as good a job as could be expected in the circumstances. There has been no return to the 1930s. The US economy is bigger than it was before the recession started, something that cannot be said of the UK. Unemployment is lower \u2013 just about \u2013 than it was when he arrived in the White House and there has been a pick-up in jobs growth in recent months. The car industry has been rescued, which it would not have been had Mitt Romney been president. Fewer people are being thrown out of their homes now that the real estate market has started to recover.</p> <p>Seen from the eurozone, where things are going from bad to worse, this looks like a reasonable record. It is not, though, the stuff of a new FDR.</p> <p>There are two main criticisms of Obama \u2013 one from the right and one from the left. Romney's case is that the president has hampered recovery by tying the economy up in knots and by allowing national debt to explode to 100% of national output. Businesses have been reluctant to hire and invest in new plant as a result of the uncertainty caused, hence the sluggish growth. The Republican challenger for the White House would cut taxes, cut spending, eliminate tax loopholes and take the axe to bureaucracy. US enterprise would be unleashed and job creation would accelerate.</p> <p>The Keynesian left, however, says Obama erred by being too cautious. He was too optimistic about the economy's ability to bounce back from deep recession. He used up all his political capital getting his healthcare bill through and paid too little attention to getting the economy back on its feet. He delivered a stimulus package just shy of $800bn (\u00a3500bn) but it was not big enough to counter the lingering effects on growth of the financial crisis. Paying far too much heed to Bill Clinton's economic advisers such as Larry Summers, he backed away from root-and-branch reform of Wall Street. Timidity has resulted in an underperforming economy leaving those who voted for Obama with gusto in 2008 feeling sorely let down. The fact that the president doesn't seem to have much of a clue about what he would do in a second term has compounded the problem.</p> <p>If Obama wins, it will be because he saved General Motors \u2013 the one moment he did come close to being a second FDR \u2013 and because of the fear that Romney would be even worse, with tax cuts favouring the rich and spending cuts that would hurt the poor. It is hard to know what Romney would do because his economic plan is full of holes. He might be a hardline fiscal conservative who would plunge the US into a double-dip recession by imposing austerity too soon. On the other hand, he might prove to be a closet Keynesian, following Reagan's approach with unfunded tax cuts that stimulate growth at the expense of a ballooning deficit.</p> <p>Whoever wins will have to confront the looming fiscal cliff, the package of tax increases and spending cuts due to be enacted in January 2013. As things stand, it will be Obama who has to come to terms with Congress following an unenthusiastic endorsement on Tuesday. After that, he might like to get down to the unfinished business of his first term: jobs, tackling poverty and inequality; repairing America's decaying infrastructure; and getting serious about the issue that in the past week has saved his bacon: climate change.</p>",
  "<p>The campaign is nearing an end. The final polls are being conducted. Soon enough, we'll all be sitting and watching actual votes being counted.</p> <p>For election junkies like myself, we always have a lot of data in our minds. We know a state's voting history and what to expect from it. What I've done here is try and put you inside the head of someone like me. I've laid out, as clearly as possible, what I believe are the key states in the presidential race on election night, along with key details on each state including <a href=\"http://www.thegreenpapers.com/G12/closing.phtml?format=gc\">closing times</a> (note that no state will be called until the last closing time for a given state), <a href=\"http://www.ismittromneythepresident.com/\">polling average</a>, <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/\">voting history</a> and the key swing counties in each state.</p> <p>The assumptions made here are pretty simple. We start with an electoral map where President Obama holds a 237 to 206 electoral vote lead. This leaves eight swing states listed below. You might notice that some of the peripheral swing states such as North Carolina and Pennsylvania are not listed. If either Obama carries North Carolina or Romney wins in Pennsylvania, this election is likely to be over very quickly. They are not swing states in my opinion.</p> <p>So, here are write-ups on the key swing states in chronological order of poll closings.</p> <p><strong>Virginia (7pm ET)</strong></p> <p><em>Real Clear Politics average:</em> Romney +0.5 points</p> <p><em>2008 result:</em> Obama won by 6.3pt</p> <p><em>2004 result:</em> Bush won by 8.2pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population (in every case, percentage points more Democratic than state in 2008):</em> Henrico (+5.9), Loudoun (+2.0)</p> <p>No state better represents the old v the new south. The northern part of the state surrounding Washington, DC is filled with highly-educated Democratic supporters, while most of the rest of the state's white population is Republican. Obama also benefits from a large African-American population in the south-east. Virginia had not voted for a Democrat for president since 1964 until it voted for Obama in 2008. The polls show the state to be dead-even, so expect this race to take hours for the networks to call as northern Virginia is usually the last to report.</p> <p><strong>Ohio (7.30pm ET)</strong></p> <p><em>Real Clear Politics average:</em> Obama +2.3pt</p> <p><em>2008 result:</em> Obama won by 4.6pt</p> <p><em>2004 result:</em> Bush won by 2.1pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Hamilton (+2.2), Lake (-3.7), Montgomery (+1.6), Portage (+4.4), Stark (+0.9), Wood (+2.5)</p> <p>No Republican has ever won the presidency without winning Ohio. This year will likely not be an exception. Obama is buffered by a large African-American population surrounding Cleveland, as well as old conservative Democrats along the state's eastern border. Romney benefits from evangelical support in the more rural areas in the western and southern sections of Ohio. Romney's strength with white working-class voters has been slowed in Ohio because of Obama's support of the auto bailout and Romney's lack thereof. Obama holds a small lead in the polls: don't expect the state to be called by the networks for at least four hours after closing.</p> <p><strong>Florida (7pm ET for eastern part of state; 8pm ET for the west)</strong></p> <p><em>Real Clear Politics average:</em> Romney +1.2pt</p> <p><em>2008 result:</em> Obama won by 2.8pt</p> <p><em>2004 result:</em> Bush won by 5.0pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Duval (-0.9), Hernando (+0.7), Hillsborough (+4.4), Pasco (+0.8), Sarasota (-2.9), Volusia (+2.9)</p> <p>George W Bush won the state by 537 votes and, with it, the White House in 2000. Much of the northern two-thirds of the state is filled with residents whose families have lived in Florida for generations. These folks are Romney's strength, along with Cubans in Miami. Obama will do very well with a growing non-Cuban Hispanic population around Orlando, black voters and Jewish retirees in the southeast. Look at the I-4 corridor in the central part of the state from Orlando to Tampa: whoever wins the I-4 will likely win the state. Polls give Romney a slight edge, although it is too close to call.</p> <p><strong>New Hampshire (7pm ET for most of state; 8pm ET for a few bigger cities)</strong></p> <p><em>Real Clear Politics average:</em> Obama +2.0pt</p> <p><em>2008 result:</em> Obama won by 9.6pt</p> <p><em>2004 result:</em> Kerry won by 1.4pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Hillsborough (-5.9), Merrimack (+4.2)</p> <p>New Hampshire was the only state to vote for George W Bush in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004. It supported Obama in 2008, but did a U-turn and voted three Republicans to the federal government in the 2010 midterms. The state is nearly all-white, yet it has a unique mix of old-time Libertarians, tax escapees from Massachusetts (note there's no income or sales tax in New Hampshire) and social liberals on the state's western edge. New Hampshire only has four electoral votes, but they could play a big role in a number of electoral scenarios. The race here is too close to call, with perhaps a slight edge to Obama.</p> <p><strong>Colorado (9pm ET)</strong></p> <p><em>Real Clear Politics average:</em> Obama + 0.9pt</p> <p><em>2008 result:</em> Obama won by 9.0pt</p> <p><em>2004 result:</em> Bush won by 4.7pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Arapahoe (+4.0), Jefferson (+0.1), Larimer (+0.8)</p> <p>This state is ground zero for the newer parts of the Democratic formula to win, despite losing working-class whites. Latinos, along with a growing highly-educated white suburban population around Denver, have shifted this former Republican stronghold into a state where either party can win. Republicans still run strong in the exurbs of Weld and the strongly religious El Paso County, home to the Christian conservative group Focus on the Family. Jefferson County, which is the basis for the comedy South Park, is likely to mirror the state's vote. Polling in the state indicates that the race is a true toss-up.</p> <p><strong>Wisconsin (9pm ET)</strong></p> <p><em>Real Clear Politics average:</em> Obama +5.0pt</p> <p><em>2008 result:</em> Obama won by 13.9pt</p> <p><em>2004 result:</em> Kerry won by 0.4pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Kenosha (+4.2), Outagamie (-2.3), Racine (-6.7), Winnebago (-2.3)</p> <p>No state is perhaps more partisan than the Badger. It was here where a recall drive against the state's controversial Republican governor failed in June. Each candidate is pretty much locked in, with 47% of the vote no matter what. Obama can count on Milwaukee with its black population, socially liberal whites around the University of Wisconsin and old-time Democrats in the west. Romney must crush in the Milwaukee suburbs, which are among the most conservative in the nation. The area around Green Bay in the northeast matches the word \"swing\" perfectly. If Romney doesn't win Ohio, he must win here. Polls give Obama a small lead.</p> <p><strong>Iowa (10pm ET)</strong></p> <p><em>Real Clear Politics average:</em> Obama +2.0pt</p> <p><em>2008 result:</em> Obama won by 9.4pt</p> <p><em>2004 result:</em> Bush won by 0.7pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Polk (+5.1), Scott (+5.0), Woodbury (-10.0)</p> <p>This state is where the primary season begins, and it likes to keep Americans guessing. It's a mix of old heartland liberals in the east and very conservative evangelicals in the west. This was one of only two states that voted for Al Gore in 2000 and George W Bush in 2004. No state has better mirrored the national vote since 1992 than Iowa. Early voting suggests a tight race, while polling gives Obama a small advantage. Obama won his first victory outside of Illinois here and would like to win where his national candidacy began. Iowa has historically not been decided until very late in the evening.</p> <p><strong>Nevada (10pm ET)</strong></p> <p><em>Real Clear Politics average:</em> Obama +2.7pt</p> <p><em>2008 result:</em> Obama won by 12.5pt</p> <p><em>2004 result:</em> Bush won by 2.6pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Washoe (+0.1)</p> <p>There is perhaps no better example of the gaining influence of Latinos in the American south-west. Combined with Jewish retirees, blacks and white casino workers, Latinos form the Democratic base in and around Las Vegas. Democrats, led by Senate Majority leader Harry Reid, have been registering voters at an incredible pace. Mitt Romney is relying on a base in the rural areas, including a large Mormon population. Washoe County in the north-west is a swing county and usually votes with the winner. Early voting suggests that Obama will carry the state, with polling mostly agreeing: Obama will likely win Nevada by a small margin.</p>",

  "<p>One of the less convincing critiques of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-elections-2012\" title=\"\">US presidential election </a>campaign, which winds up on Tuesday, is that there has not been much to choose between the incumbent, President Obama, and his challenger, Mitt Romney.</p> <p>The reality is very different. Instead, a stark choice exists. One can only judge a candidate on his past record and on what he has pledged to do in the future. Romney has said and done a lot of things, many contradictory, some deliberately so. It has been very hard to know during the campaign which Romney is real: the man who backed the precursor of Obamacare when he was governor or the candidate who suggested to donors that almost half of Americans were welfare beneficiaries beyond his political reach? Is he the centrist Republican of the first presidential debate or the man who insisted during the primaries he was \"severely conservative\"?</p> <p>Doubts about Romney have accrued not only from his ever shifting politics but also from a wider sense of flakiness. His economic policies have a touch of the fantastic. Romney would enact large tax cuts, reducing revenue, while increasing defence spending sharply, but also arguing he would eat into the deficit by spending cuts alone.</p> <p>On foreign policy too, Romney represents a return to the disastrous years of George W Bush \u2013 threatening confrontation with China by saying he would list it as a currency manipulator, while making bellicose noises about conflict with Iran.</p> <p>On the other side of the balance sheet, what is there to say about Obama? Few would disagree that America's first black president, who was once able to inspire with his oratory, has lost some of his lustre. The messages of hope and change ran aground in the midst of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, exacerbated both by the parlous state of the economy he inherited from his predecessor and by the two huge costly wars he was obliged to fight.</p> <p>If he has not transformed America in the way that many might have hoped, he has at least mitigated some of the pain while moving to bring to an end one of the US's greatest iniquities, its shocking inequality in affordable healthcare provision. Through the car manufacturers' bailout, his insistence on stress testing of banks and through carefully targeted stimuli, he ensured that the US now appears to be emerging from financial crisis with modest growth and a rise in employment figures even as those European governments that pursued a strategy of austerity are at very best bumping along the bottom. Obama steered a course between the left of his own party, who were advocating for populist but risky measures, and Republican obstructionism.</p> <p>On foreign policy, the Obama doctrine has been a mixed bag. He strictly limited US involvement in the most significant military adventure launched under his watch, in Libya, and has resisted Israeli pressure for military strikes against Iran. On the Arab Spring, he has preferred by and large to keep a watching brief and avoided an overt entanglement in Syria. After the war in Iraq, launched on a false pretence, and the mishandling of Afghanistan by Bush, this caution should be seen as positive.</p> <p>But while Obama may have brought an end to some of the human rights abuses of the Bush era, he has failed either to close Guant\u00e1namo Bay, as he promised, or moved to end the immunity of Bush-era officials implicated in abuses.</p> <p>On climate change too, Obama has been disappointing, not least on the campaign trail. In 2008, speaking at the <a href=\"http://www.clintonglobalinitiative.org/\" title=\"\">Clinton Global Initiative, </a>he insisted: \"No single issue sits at the crossroads of as many currents as energy. This is a security threat, an economic albatross and a moral challenge of our time.\"</p> <p>Whoever is elected will face a new presidential term marked by considerable challenges. While the US is recovering from recession it remains weak and would be vulnerable to a number of factors, including a war in the Gulf over Iran disrupting oil supplies, China falling into recession itself or a further worsening of the eurozone crisis.</p> <p>He will also have to engage quickly with the \"fiscal cliff\", due at the year's end, when temporary payroll tax cuts are due to come to an end, which promises a tough choice between sharp tax increases for ordinary Americans that would threaten the recovery (but cut the deficit) or an extension of the tax cuts and a consequent increase in the deficit, an issue fraught with political strife.</p> <p>On the wider stage, the war in Syria is sucking in its neighbours, producing growing instability and, for all Obama's alleged commitment to negotiated solutions, he appears unable to engage Assad's main backer, Russia. The proposed draw down of the majority of US troops in Afghanistan by 2014 and the continuing tensions in Pakistan threaten another crisis.</p> <p>Despite all of these caveats, the candidate best equipped for the challenging period ahead is Barack Obama. While his campaign has hardly been inspiring, he remains a thoughtful figure who has taken his responsibilities with a seriousness absent from the Bush years. He has brought a new dignity to the White House and while there remain many who are still opposed to him simply for the colour of his skin, for many others he has achieved the remarkable by making it seem unremarkable that the president of the United States is a black man.</p> <p>His response to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/hurricane-sandy\" title=\"\">hurricane Sandy,</a> praised by both the independent mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, and the Republican New Jersey governor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2012/oct/31/chris-christie-republican-pass-notes\" title=\"\">Chris Christie</a>, was a belated reminder that there is a wider middle ground in US politics than the recent period of partisan disputes has often led us to believe.</p> <p>In the coming months, it will not be solely the new president's responsibility to confront the challenges facing the US and the world but all of those involved in the US political process. Any chance for healing and consensus after the elections should be grasped by all sides. This election offers an opportunity for a fresh start for US politics itself. It should not be squandered.</p>",
  "<p>How much has the extraordinary wave of hope that swept the world four years ago, when President Obama was inaugurated, been borne out by his first term in office?</p> <p>Why do I think it is so vital that he wins again this week, for America and for the world?</p> <p>Let's remember President Obama inherited a very deep hole, a hole most Americans did not imagine existed. When he came in, we had lost four million jobs in four years \u2013 800,000 jobs evaporated in January 2009 alone. Since that time, we have created five and a half million new jobs. That's more than 30 straight months of job growth in tough economic times. In addition, he had to confront banks that, through their greed, had forced record-breaking home foreclosures. The global economy \u2013 from the US to Europe and around the world \u2013 was at the point of total collapse. The banks were bailed out.</p> <p>The automotive industry had collapsed. Now, because of the Obama administration's policies to rescue the auto industry, we're the number one auto-producing nation again. Autoworkers are once more working three shifts and producing high yields. The auto industry is back, though Romney said: \"Let them go bankrupt.\"</p> <p>Furthermore, when President Obama came into office, we were caught in a war of choice \u2013 an immoral, bad choice \u2013 in Iraq. President Bush and Tony Blair dealt us a severe blow. The whole world was telling them not to wage war \u2013 I was speaking in London at Hyde Park on the day of the big <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/2765041.stm\" title=\"\">protest</a>. We told them there was no basis for going into Iraq. Since then, we have lost British and American lives, resources and honour, and they have not been humble enough to apologise. That war cost us trillions of dollars, which took us from a budget surplus to a budget deficit.</p> <p>Now we have left Iraq and the administration has implemented a plan to wind down the war in Afghanistan, which is coming to a close in terms of American involvement. Billions of dollars spent on war can now be redirected to jobs, investment and economic development at home.</p> <p>There's a lot more we must do to be seen as leading the world by right. We have become addicted to leading by might and it takes some time to restore confidence and credibility. We're not there yet but we're moving in the right direction.</p> <p>So yes, when President Obama took office, the US and the world were in a deep, dark economic (and political) hole. But now we are moving through fields towards the mountaintop. Though we've yet to reach that point, the arrows are pointing in the right direction \u2013 jobs, industry, healthcare cover all on the rise, wars on the decline.</p> <p>Romney and the conservatives have derided the comprehensive health care plan as \"Obamacare.\" But the truth is that Obama does care. People would be dead without health insurance. And young people benefit as they can stay on their parents' health plans into their 20s. The insurance companies were charging higher and higher fees for ever lower cover and they claimed the right not to insure people. Obama broke up that kind of exploitative behaviour and today 30 million more Americans are covered. Obama's historic healthcare legislation will stand the test of time.</p> <p>And all of this achieved despite the attempt by the Republicans&#xa0;to demean the president.&#xa0;They called him a liar. They said that he's not an American, he's not a Christian, he's illegitimate.</p> <p>Romney offers no positive alternative for America. We are currently in the throes of a weather crisis, hurricane Sandy, which has wreaked havoc on the east coast. Railroads, subways, roads, bridges, houses, banks, whole communities have been devastated. Romney once said we don't need Fema, the federal government agency now co-ordinating the rescue and recovery programme related to these disasters. He says \"state authorities\" (not the federal government) should handle that devastation \u2013 and private investors.</p> <p>The fact is a state alone cannot handle such problems. And&#xa0;private investors should not be profiting out of such misery. It's the role of&#xa0;central government to be a part of the emergency repair and to be a part of the clean-up and reconstruction. Because of an act of nature, there must now be a massive investment in infrastructure. It will create jobs and contracts, new technology as well as other scientific advances.</p> <p>President Obama had made the case for that before the disaster \u2013 for the need to invest in infrastructure, in roads, buildings and bridges, to reinvest in America to put Americans back to work. Now that he's leading us in this crisis, even his adversaries are saying he's doing a good job. &#xa0;The president's leadership during hurricane Sandy is steady and confident.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/18/obama-inauguration-obama-white-house\" title=\"\">I said in an article in the <em>Observer</em> four years ago that Barack Obama's inauguration</a> was a magnificent moment in a five-decades-long race for civil rights in America and in the world as a whole. Has his first term&#xa0;stood up to the extraordinary hope he inspired? For black Americans, a ceiling has been removed. An African American, a woman or a Latino can&#xa0;now believe that their path through life will carry them as far as their dreams can imagine. If Obama can do it, it inspires women to think they can do it and Latinos to think they can do it. So the barrier to our dreams has been removed.</p> <p>But you cannot have racial reconciliation unless you have racial justice. Our <a href=\"http://www.rainbowpush.org/\" title=\"\">Rainbow</a> friends in the UK call it Equanomics \u2013 racial equality and economic justice. Black people are still facing tremendous racial injustice; we're number one in home foreclosure; the banks target us. We're number one in infant mortality. Number one in short life expectancy. Number one in unemployment. We're still very much on the margins.</p> <p>A few have done well enough to become symbolic examples. You look at Colin Powell, you look at Oprah and you look at some great athletes. But you can't measure the progress of the masses of black Americans by the symbolic value of extraordinary achievers. It's like swimming the English Channel. It's not the distance that makes it difficult to swim \u2013 it's the undercurrent. That's what we're struggling against \u2013 an undercurrent based on centuries of enslavement, institutional race inequalities and unfounded fears.</p> <p>I look at America embracing&#xa0;Olympic&#xa0;medallists, black and white; embracing the impact of black music upon the culture. You'd think those achievements would have brought more reconciliation. But we seem to be cherry-picking \u2013 selectively recognising black success while still disregarding racial injustice.</p> <p>The scar on America's soul is racial injustice. It is the key to equality, workers' rights, children's rights, environmental security and ending war. So how this issue is handled is the key to the salvation of our nation. Martin Luther King would say that the pursuit of racial justice is the way to redeem the soul of America. President Obama's achievement can only be seen as part of&#xa0;a long battle for civil rights. What one must appreciate is that his ascendancy is a long journey that can be traced in modern history He did not come to us unilaterally. He came out of a 64-year process. In 1948, President Truman ended military racial segregation. The Supreme Court knocked down decades of legal segregation in the Brown v Board of Education decision. We won a big victory in 1955 with the Montgomery bus boycott, after Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat to a white person, leading to the end of segregation by 1964. We won the <a href=\"http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/1964_civil_rights_act.htm\" title=\"\">1964 Civil Rights Act</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/intro/intro_b.php\" title=\"\">1965 Voting Rights Act, e</a>nding discrimination at elections. We staged the anti-Vietnam war protests. From 1948 to 2008, there were 60 years of victories: overcoming obstacles, removing walls, pulling down barriers. Obama comes out of that process. &#xa0;He's a result of the &#xa0;years of struggle. He is the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. He ran a fast, able leg of the race we're in. He is a member of a team.</p> <p>So has the issue of race in American politics been transformed for all time? &#xa0;Absolutely not. The forces of hostility have in a strange way been reinvigorated, their fears have been revived, their anger has been rekindled, the mean spirits have resurged. America has a deep-seated commitment to unfounded racial fears and, win or lose, those fears will not go away.</p> <p>There are attempts to take the civil rights victories back. Our opponents are fighting the civil war of 1865. They're trying to pit states' rights against a more perfect union, the federal government. If Obama loses, they'll be empowered to undermine years of work. &#xa0;If Romney wins and puts right-wingers on the Supreme Court, the courts could rule to undermine the entire movement made by Dr King. Who appoints the next Supreme Court justices will determine the next 50 years of America. &#xa0;</p> <p>The scale of the president's achievement is not just a matter of his complexion, but the direction in which he has tried to take the country. He has done a huge amount, but a unified America could have achieved twice as much. Instead, the Republicans have been planning how to make him a one-term president since the time of his inauguration in January 2009. Their mission was not about job creation, bank reconstruction or to revive manufacturing. Their mission was not to rebuild. Their mission was at all costs to undermine his authority. &#xa0;</p> <p>If the president wins, conservative right-wingers will not stop fighting ideologically. &#xa0;We must maintain our struggle to prevail. We need to keep taking the nation forward by hope and never backward by fear. We need to keep hope alive.</p>",
  "<p>President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney on Saturday began the last frantic days of campaigning in their battle for the White House by criss-crossing America's key swing states.</p> <p>Obama's team was planning a series of large events aimed at drawing big crowds. His closing weekend included two joint events with former president Bill Clinton: a rally on Saturday night in Virginia and an event on Sunday in New Hampshire.</p> <p>At a rally in Ohio \u2013 the most important swing state in the contest \u2013 Obama touted his first-term record and promised that he would do more to get America's struggling economy back on track. \"We've made real progress these past four years. But Ohio, we're here today because we all know we've got more work to do,\" he told the crowd in the town of Mentor. \"As long as there's a single American who wants a job and still can't find work; as long as there are families who are working harder and harder but are still falling behind; as long as there's a child anywhere in this country who is languishing in poverty, or barred from opportunity, we got more work to do,\" he added.</p> <p>Though national polls show a race that is virtually tied, it appears that Obama has maintained a slim but steady lead in the swing states, making him the favourite of most media pundits as the election comes to a close. Influential New York Times election blogger Nate Silver put Obama's current chances of winning at around 80%. The latest Wall Street Journal/Marist/NBC poll in Ohio put Obama up by six points in a state that no Republican challenger has ever won the White House without. But elsewhere things were more fluid. In Florida one poll early on Saturday morning showed Obama with a two-point lead, while another claimed Romney was six points ahead.</p> <p>Both campaigns tried to claim a boost from the jobs numbers released on Friday in an election in which the economy, and the fragility of America's recovery, has been the core issue. Obama's team pointed to a better than expected number of new jobs at 171,000. But Romney and other Republican figures seized on the rise in the nation's jobless rate to 7.9%, though that increase was largely due to people returning to the job market to look for work. Obama will face voters with the highest unemployment rate of any incumbent president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt during the Great Depression.</p> <p>Romney and his team were not letting up with their message that change was sorely needed in order to get America's economy growing again. He said Obama's first term had been marked by an endless series of broken promises, from job creation to working with Republicans. \"He made a lot of promises, but they were promises he couldn't keep. I've made promises that I've kept and will keep for the American people,\" Romney told a crowd in Dubuque, Iowa, another vital swing state.</p> <p>The Romney team also released a new TV ad that criticises Obama for saying \"voting is the best revenge\" at a rally in Friday in Ohio. That line has given Romney a new avenue of attack in trying to portray Obama as a divisive figure compared with Romney's own attempted image-makeover as a centrist. \"Vote for revenge?\" the Republican candidate asked at a rally in New Hampshire. ,\"Let me tell you what I'd like to tell you: vote for love of country. It is time we lead America to a better place.\"</p> <p>Both sides are now engaged in an all-out push. Virtually Romney's entire senior team has left the campaign's Boston headquarters to travel with him for the contest's final few days. Meanwhile, some of Obama's top aides from his historic campaign four years ago were planning to join him on the road, including Robert Gibbs, who served as Obama's first White House press secretary, and Reggie Love, the president's former personal aide.</p> <p>Romney and the Republican party have raised some eyebrows by seeking to expand the political battleground to include Pennsylvania, despite the fact that a Democrat has won the state for the last five presidential contests. Obama won Pennsylvania by more than 10 percentage points in 2008 and the latest polls in the state give him a four- to five-point lead. Nevertheless, Romney will campaign in the Philadelphia suburbs on Sunday. Republican strategists say that they think the state is in play, pointing to a disillusioned Democratic base.</p> <p>However, Democratic aides, including Obama's campaign guru, David Axelrod, have laughed off the Romney visit there as a piece of clever spin. But they are also seeking to head it off by adding television spending in the state, and have even sent Bill Clinton to campaign there on Monday. Vice-president Joe Biden has also visited the area.</p> <p>Democrats have also put huge emphasis on trying to get their side to vote early. At some Democratic rallies, buses park outside waiting to take attendees to early voting booths. Though no votes will be counted until election day itself, several battleground states have released the party affiliation of people who have voted early. So far, Democratic voters outnumber Republicans in Florida, Iowa, Nevada, North Carolina and Ohio. Republicans have the lead in Colorado.</p> <p>The immediate political impact of hurricane Sandy, which devastated parts of New York, New Jersey and other north-eastern states earlier in the week, was starting to recede. Though many of the worst-hit towns and neighbourhoods remained in trouble and without power, life was getting back to normal in many other areas. Power had been returned to nearly all of Manhattan and the military was taking steps to ease a dramatic fuel shortage in New Jersey that had led to huge queues and the need for a police presence at gas stations.</p> <p>The main political consequence of the storm seemed to be the embrace of Obama by New Jersey governor Chris Christie. Christie, who has been an active surrogate for Romney and gave a high-profile speech at the Republican party convention in Tampa, was effusive in his praise for Obama's performance during the disaster. Images of the two men working together were seen as a coup for the president and have raised Republican hackles that Christie might have deliberately undermined Romney's campaign at the last minute to serve his own political needs.</p>"
