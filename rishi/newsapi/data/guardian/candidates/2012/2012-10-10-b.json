  "<p>Republicans have been itching for the match-up between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan since the instant Romney put Ryan on the ticket, if not before. Their <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/gops-move-to-downplay-ryans-debate-skills-isnt-sticking-in-ohio/2012/10/08/d405567a-1156-11e2-ba83-a7a396e6b2a7_story.html\">confidence</a> that the contest will end in a lopsided victory makes Chris Christie's optimistic pronouncements about the first presidential debate seem downright reserved by comparison: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think Ryan's going to eat him alive.</p> </blockquote> <p>And, hey, Christie turned out to have been right, though the mechanics of transforming Obama's lackluster performance into the devastating loss the pundits keep talking about largely depended on the dismal expectations they held for Romney. Going into Thursday's debate, Ryan instead walks on the brittle hopes of an emboldened GOP. Biden just walks.</p> <p>Biden does not raise the ire among conservatives that Dick Cheney did with liberals; his peculiar charm is to come across as basically competent and up to the job, but without the desire to wield even more power. Republicans do not joke about his cold, black heart and maniacal lust for world domination; one cannot picture him shooting a friend in the face, unless it is with a <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/online/vice-president-joe-biden-had-a-super-soaker-fight-with-children-at-a-picnic-yesterday/#0\">SuperSoaker</a>. (Imagine Cheney brandishing a toy gun around children without them screaming in terror.)</p> <p>No, the jokes the right makes about Biden have to do with his clumsy malapropos and <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/aug/15/news/la-pn-joe-biden-used-chains-metaphor-before-to-hit-republicans-20120815\">rambling metaphors</a>; his speechifying tics (\"literally\", multiple and contradictory references to his rough childhood) give them TMJ but don't ignite conspiracy theories. They anticipate his debate against Ryan not because he seems to be a worthy foe against whom a hard-fought victory would signify a triumph of ideas, but because they think Ryan will steamroll the guy.</p> <p>Still, Biden has a core strength that could prove Ryan's undoing: loyalty untrimmed by ambition. Sure, Biden has found his level in the office of the vice president a wading-pool of influence that Ryan seems to already have judged too shallow for his burgeoning empire of ideas. Biden is content to be regional district manager with a window in his office; Ryan dreams of the corner executive suite (or in this case, the executive suite with no corners). Ryan wants to win, Biden wants <em>his team</em> to win. Biden will take one for the team, no questions asked (he <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/politics/2012/president/candidates/obama/2012/10/10/biden-likely-play-hardball-debate/ZMLjHZiub7iCT625LVbaLI/story.html\">went on stage</a> with <em>Sarah Palin</em>); faced with contradictions between his ideas and his running mate's, Ryan just refuses to take questions.</p> <p>Biden's willingness to take orders smoothed over the one instance in this presidency where his exuberance overwhelmed his faithfulness: his <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0512/76103.html\">ahead-of-the-Obama-curve endorsement of same-sex marriage</a>. In general, Biden's excitement is in service of the president: every success is a \"Big Fucking Deal\".</p> <p>Ryan lacks the same level of enthusiasm for Romney, much less his policies. Ryan made a name for himself in Washington by flacking a budget proposal <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/19/newt-gingrich-radical-paul-ryan-thanks_n_864083.html\">too conservative</a> for Newt Gingrich \u2013 so bold (even reckless) that it didn't need a spokesman so much as a target. Ryan's championing of his budget allowed other Republicans to endorse its radical ideas without being tainted by their decidedly unfriendly ideas. When Romney picked Ryan, he hoped to capitalize on the gusto of Ryan's rhetoric, but duck its policy prescriptions. Ryan has thus far been uncomfortable, but tolerant, in his role of help-meat, trading his details and \"roadmap\" visions for generic campaign stumpery.</p> <p>Ryan's success as a running mate has been in direct proportion to his willingness to emphasize style over substance, putting Biden in the unlikely position of wanting his debate opponent to engage on real issues \u2013 and to be the beneficiary of a talkative antagonist. If Biden does exactly what Obama did in the last debate, and just let Ryan motor on, the chances are all the greater that Ryan will say what he actually believes \u2013 so much of which is heroically unpopular with American voters \u2013 and with Mitt Romney. (Ryan is <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/blog/169353/paul-ryan-covers-romneys-right-flank#\">far to the right</a> of most Americans on social issues, just to the right of Romney on the same; when it comes to fiscal policy, he's barely in the same universe as Americans, though, to be fair, at least he exists in a place with recognizable laws of logic. Romney's math floats alongside invisible numbers in an alternate reality.)</p> <p>Romney emerged from the first presidential debate with the wind at his back almost entirely because he took advantage of the national audience to turn swiftly away from the anger and base-baiting politics that characterized his campaign through September. Ryan has had less practice at shaking his personal Etch-a-Sketch than Romney has, and has shown less interest in it. He's more of a paint-by-numbers guy.</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney and his running mate Paul Ryan were scrambling on Wednesday to present a coherent position on abortion amid accusations from Democrats that the Republican presidential candidate had hidden his true beliefs in an attempt to appeal to moderate voters.</p> <p>In the wake of a Romney interview with the <a href=\"http://blogs.desmoinesregister.com/dmr/index.php/2012/10/09/romney-says-abortion-legislation-isnt-part-of-his-agenda\">Des Moines Register</a> newspaper in which he said his agenda included no legislation to restrict abortion, his campaign team launched a damage limitation exercise to assure conservative voters that he remained staunchly pro-life. </p> <p>Within hours of the comments being published on Tuesday, Romney's campaign insisted that he was against abortion, telling the conservative National Review Online that Romney \"would, of course, support legislation aimed at providing greater protections for life.</p> <p>\"Mitt Romney is proudly pro-life, and he will be a pro-life president,\" said his spokeswoman Andrea Saul in a statement.</p> <p>But on Wednesday, an intervention by Ryan during a campaign stop deepened the confusion. Asked by reporters about the differences between him and Romney on the issue, Ryan, who is against abortion in all cases, including rape, incest and where the mother's life is in danger, said: \"Our position is unified. Our position is consistent and hasn't changed.\"</p> <p>As the controversy escalated, Romney himself sought to draw a line under it. </p> <p>He told reporters in Ohio: \"I think I've said time and again that I'm a pro-life candidate and I'll be a pro-life president. The actions I'll take immediately is to remove funding for Planned Parenthood. It will not be part of my budget. And also I've indicated that I will reverse the Mexico City position of the president. I will reinstate the Mexico City policy which keeps us from using foreign aid for abortions overseas.\"</p> <p>Romney's anti-abortion views are less extreme than Ryan's. While he has stated that he supports the overturning of the Roe v Wade supreme court decision, he believes there should be exceptions to a ban on abortion. </p> <p>Ryan, by contrast, has sponsored a series of bills that would either restrict abortion or access to contraception, or both. The differing views of the two men over the issue was highlighted most recently in August when Ryan's views were tied to those of Todd Akin, the Republican Senate candidate in Missouri who was abandoned by the party after comments on \"legitimate rape\".</p> <p>Two months ago, when asked a similar question about the difference on abortion between him and Romney, Ryan acknowledged the difference between them when he told reporters he was \"proud of my pro-life record\" but said that Romney set the policy.</p> <p>A call to the Romney campaign from the Guardian to clarify the position \u2013 and what Ryan's \"unified\" comment meant \u2013 was not immediately returned.</p> <p>Romney's initial remarks to the Des Moines Register were pounced on by Barack Obama campaign officials, who accused him of \"cynically and dishonestly\" hiding his true anti-abortion position.</p> <p>Stephanie Cutter, Obama's deputy campaign press secretary, told reporters: \"We're not saying that he's changed his mind on these issues. We're saying that he is trying to cover up his beliefs.\"</p> <p>She added: \"Every step of the way he has been anti-choice, against Roe v Wade.\"</p> <p>Reaction among conservatives to Romney's remarks was also critical. A comment piece in the conservative newspaper The Weekly Standard on Wednesday titled \"Did Mitt Romney forget?\" suggested that he was \"mistaken\" and had simply not realised how many issues related to abortion funding he could influence.</p> <p>\"The issue here does not appear to be that Romney is backing off his stance on abortion \u2013 indeed, he says he will use an executive order to cut off funding to groups that perform abortion overseas,\" it read. \"But he is mistaken in thinking that there aren't issues related to abortion funding are handled through the legislative process at the federal level.\"</p> <p>Romney's past commitments have included ensuring US laws reflect \"values of preserving life\". He has previously promised to: support foetal pain legislation, which bans abortion after 20 weeks, on the much-debated basis that foetuses can feel pain at that stage; end public health funds for Planned Parenthood because the group provides abortions; and support a decades-old ban on federal funds for abortions.</p> <p>He supports the reversal of Roe v Wade, but believes in exceptions for victims of rape and incest, or when the mother's life is in danger.</p> <p>Romney, who had been pro-choice as governor of Massachusetts, repeatedly asserted his anti-abortion credentials as he battled to win the Republican nomination. During a televised debate in Charleston on 19 January before the South Carolina primary, for example, he said: \"You can count on me as president of the United States to pursue a policy that protects the life of the unborn, whether here in this country or overseas. And I'll reverse the policies of this president.\"</p> <p>In his acceptance speech to the Republican convention in Tampa in August, he promised that as president he would \"protect the sanctity of life\".</p> <p>Anti-abortion groups said on Wednesday they didn't see Romney's comments as evidence of a change of heart. Tony Perkins, president of the anti-abortion Family Research Council, told <a href=\"http://2012.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/10/anti-abortion-activists-call-romneys-new-comments-a-gaffe-not-a-change-of-heart.php\">Talking Points Memo</a> the Romney campaign called him soon after the remarks were published by the Iowa newspaper and assured him it didn't represent a shift from his support for pro-life issues.</p> <p>Romney's comments came as he sought to maintain his recent appeal to female voters in the closing stages of the presidential race. A poll by Pew this week found Romney neck-and-neck among women with Barack Obama, who has held an enormous advantage with this demographic.</p>",
  "<p>Two former heads of US diplomatic security in Libya have told a congressional hearing that requests for additional agents to protect American officials and premises in the face of a growing threat from armed militias were rejected by the state department ahead of the attack on the Benghazi consulate that killed the US ambassador, Chris Stevens, and three other officials.</p> <p>At a heated hearing before the House of representatives oversight committee, Republicans painted a picture of an incompetent state department failing to heed warnings of a growing terrorist threat or to prepare for a possible attack on the anniversary of 9/11, and then covering up the circumstances of the full scale militia assault that killed Stevens. They also accused Obama administration officials of attempting to suppress unclassified documents because they were politically embarrassing.</p> <p>Democrats described the investigation as a partisan political move intended to embarrass the White House in the run up to the presidential election.</p> <p>Hours before the hearing, the state department was forced into an embarrassing retreat on its claim that the attackers used the cover of a popular protest outside the consulate as cover for the assault. Officials acknowledged on Tuesday that there was no protest and that as it occurred on September 11 it was likely timed to mark the anniversary of al-Qaida's assault on the US 11 years ago.</p> <p>The former head of embassy security in Libya, Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Wood, said that he recognised the situation in Libya was volatile and that he and other officials pressed for additional agents to protect the consulate in Benghazi. </p> <p>\"The security in Benghazi was a struggle and remained a struggle throughout my time there \u2026 Diplomatic security remained weak,'' he said. \"The RSO (regional security officer) struggled to obtain additional personnel there, but was never able to attain the numbers he felt comfortable with.\"</p> <p>The committee chairman, Darrel Issa, then released state department cables not previously made public containing the requests for more security including one from the then ambassador to Libya, Gene Cretz.</p> <p>Another official, Eric Nordstrom, who was responsible for protecting US diplomats in Libya, said that he too sought additional resources. But he said he was told over the phone by a senior state department official responsible for handling the request, Charlene Lamb, not to make any more because \"there would be too much political cost\".</p> <p>After that Republican members of Congress honed in on Lamb, who was also a witness, accusing her of failing to recognise the seriousness of the threat.<br>Lamb responded that the requests were for more personnel in Tripoli and it would have made no difference to how many security men would have been protecting the Benghazi consulate where protection was in any case mostly in the hands of a pro-government militia.</p> <p>\"We had the correct number of assets in Benghazi on the night of 9/11,\" Lamb testified.</p> <p>However, Republican attempts to accuse the state department of leaving the consulate vulnerable by refusing requests for more security were delivered a blow when Nordstrom was asked how many agents he wanted to protect the Benghazi site. He said he asked for three. The hearing then heard that there were five at the time of the attack.</p> <p>Congressman Jason Chaffetz noted that after the state department declined to increase the number of security personnel it did raise the danger pay of Wood and his colleagues.</p> <p>Nordstrom suggested that it might have been difficult to protect the consulate in any circumstance.</p> <p>\"I had not seen an attack of such ferocity and intensity previously in Libya nor in my time with the diplomatic security service,\" he said. \"I'm concerned that this attack signals a new security reality, just as the 1983 Beirut marine barracks bombings did for the marines, the 1998 East Africa embassy bombings did for the state department and 9/11 did for our entire country.\"</p> <p>But Nordstrom warned that it would be wrong to react to the attack and the continuing threat by retreating to a bunker.</p> <p>Republican congressmen hammered away at the accusation that the state department had failed to heed warnings of an escalating threat and that officials gave \"demonstrably false statements\" about the circumstances of the attack.</p> <p>The committee released a memo from Stevens sent on the day he was killed in which he described an array of armed militias competing for control and some of their leaders as criticising the US for taking political sides by backing the government in Tripoli. He also described growing Islamist influence in the town of Derna, to the east of Benghazi.</p> <p>However <a href=\"http://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/9-11-12-Memo.pdf\">the memo also reported</a> that Benghazi council said the security situation was improving and appealed for American investment.</p> <p>Nordstrom described a chaotic situation in Libya shortly after the revolution, saying that the new government had so little control that it could not provide security for diplomats and embassies.</p> <p>\"We could not rely on the Libyan government for security, intelligence and law enforcement help to identify emerging threats or to ask them for assistance in mitigating those threats. In Benghazi however, the government of Libya through the 17 February Martyrs Brigade was able to provide us consistent armed security since the very earliest days of the revolution,\" he said.</p> <p>Nordstrom said that the long-term plan was to create a local force to protect the consulate.</p> <p>Issa accused the administration of a cover-up of the circumstances of the attack because for days the administration stuck with the claim that the attack was made under the cover of a popular protest against an anti-Islam film.</p> <p>One witness, assistant secretary of state Patrick Kennedy, defended the US ambassador to the UN, Susan Rice, who has faced calls to resign for her statements in the days after the attack saying it was a response to an anti-Muslim video that prompted demonstrations across the Middle East. </p> <p>Kennedy said Rice based her assertion on the best information she had at the time and hinted that it came from the intelligence services but said he could not discuss it in public.</p> <p>The hearing at times degenerated into a spat over what is classified information after Chaffetz attempted to prevent Kennedy speaking about exactly who was protecting US officials and premises in Libya on the grounds he was revealing classified information. He also objected to a satellite image readily available on Google.</p> <p>A Democratic member of the committee, Stephen Lynch, expressed astonishment, saying that Chaffetz had pressed for the hearing specifically to air accusations that the state department had not provided sufficient security.</p> <p>The mother of one of the Americans killed in the Benghazi attack, Glenn Doherty, has accused Mitt Romney of using her son's death for political ends.</p> <p>\"I don't trust Romney,\" Barbara Doherty told a Boston television station, WHDH. \"He shouldn't make my son's death part of his political agenda. It's wrong to use these brave young men, who wanted freedom for all, to degrade Obama.\"</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney's latest comments on abortion, which appeared to soften his pro-life stance, have reignited debate not just on his own apparently evolving beliefs on the issue, but also on the hardline anti-abortion views of his running mate, Paul Ryan.</p> <p>The Romney campaign has said it would not oppose abortion in cases of rape, a clear departure from contradicts Ryan who believes there should be no exceptions to a ban on abortion.</p> <p>Ryan was a co-sponsor of a controversial House bill last year defining life as the moment of fertilisation and granting \"personhood\" rights to embryos. Abortion rights activists say the Sanctity of Human Life Act would have outlawed all abortions without exceptions, restricted some forms of contraception, in-vitro fertilisation and stem-cell research.</p> <p>The bill never made it onto the floor of the House. All state attempts to introduce so-called \"personhood\" amendments into law have failed, even in conservative states.</p> <p>Ryan also voted for and co-sponsored a bill dubbed the \"let women die\" bill by pro-choice campaigners. It would allow hospitals to deny emergency abortions, even when it is necessary to save a woman's life.</p> <p>The Republican representative for Wisconsin has been one of the most active anti-abortion members of Congress, co-sponsoring 38 anti-abortion bills, including some that <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-22/ryan-opposition-to-abortion-consistent-with-akin-s-no-exceptions.html\">do not make exceptions for victims of rape</a>.</p> <p>Since first elected to the house in 1998, Ryan has not voted against any bills backed by the National Right to Life Committee. The group gives him a lifetime voting score of 100%.</p> <p>The tally by the abortion rights group, NARAL Pro-Choice America, on the other hand, have recorded Ryan as having voted on 59 occasions against abortion and other reproductive rights issues.</p> <p>He co-sponsored a measure that would require a woman seeking an abortion to undergo an ultrasound first. He also co-sponsored legislation that would have banned abortions after 20 weeks gestation in the District of Columbia, with no exceptions for rape or incest.</p> <p>A further two bills that he co-sponsored last year would have restricted the definition of rape. The bills sought to ban federal funds from being used for abortion, except in the case of \"forcible rape\". Use of the term \"forcible\" was criticised by Democrats and it was subsequently removed in an amendment.</p> <p>As chairman of the House Budget Committee, he drafted a budget blueprint that sought to end federal dollars for Title X, the national family-planning program.</p> <p>The difficulties for a Romney-Ryan ticket among women was highlighted in August when Ryan's extreme pro-life views were tied to those of Todd Akin, the Republican Senate candidate in Missouri who was abandoned by the party after comments on \"legitimate rape\".</p> <p>Ryan told reporters at the time he was \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/22/paul-ryan-republican-abortion-row\">proud of my pro-life record</a>\" but said that Romney set the policy.</p>",
  "<p>When Joe Biden was last seen on a national debate stage four years ago, it was put to him by the moderator Gwen Ifill that his perceived weakness was lack of discipline. \"You're very kind suggesting my only achilles heel is my lack of discipline,\" the then-senator replied. \"Others talk about my excessive passion.\"</p> <p>On Thursday night, as he steps in front of the TV cameras in Danville, Kentucky, to face his vice-presidential rival Paul Ryan, he will need to overcome both impediments and display discipline combined with great, though not excessive, passion. The stakes are high: in the wake of Barack Obama's own debate appearance last week the president's poll ratings have taken a nose-dive and the Romney-Ryan ticket has been reinvigorated.</p> <p>It falls now to Biden, a politician who, as vice-president, has spent much of the past four years out of the limelight, to deliver the performance of his political career. \"He has to reframe the debate,\" said Darrell West, a specialist in government and media at the Brookings Institution.</p> <p>\"Obama's poor showing allowed Mitt Romney to completely recast his record, and the Democrats can't afford that to happen again. I expect Biden to be aggressive in pointing out the differences between the two campaigns over the major issues.\"</p> <p>For the past three days, Biden, 69, has been sequestered at home in Wilmington, Delaware, in intensive debate prep with a team of advisers led by David Axelrod, Obama's chief re-election strategist. Biden has been rehearsing alongside Maryland congressman Chris Van Hollen, who has been role-playing Ryan, and has been thoroughly mugging up on his opponent's policy positions including a close textual analysis of the book co-written by Ryan: Young Guns.</p> <p>The implication is clear: Biden will move heaven and earth not to repeat Obama's mistakes of last week in which the president was deemed to have been too passive in his encounter with Romney. \"He's going to be very attuned to any attempt by Ryan to present himself as more moderate than he is,\" West said.</p> <p>The need for Biden to exploit the contradictions in his opponent's positions \u2013 in a way that Obama failed to do with Romney \u2013 is clearly on the minds of top aides. Jennifer Psaki, press secretary of the Obama re-election campaign, told a gaggle of reporters on Air Force One this week that \"the question here is: which Paul Ryan is going to come to the debate later this week? Is it going to be the Paul Ryan who has been misleading about everything from his marathon time to details and specifics he included in his convention speech?</p> <p>\"Or is it going to be the Paul Ryan who has eagerly embraced voucherizing Medicare and tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires? We'll all be watching.\"</p> <p>Robert Barnett, the doyen of debate prep coaches, who has held the hands of Democratic candidates in no fewer than eight presidential races since 1976 and is part of the Obama-Biden prep team this year, said the focus on substantial policy differences is always ultimately more important than the one-line zinger or the gaffe. Barnett points out that the most famous soundbite of any VP debate \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-7gpgXNWYI\">\"Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy\"</a> \u2013 was delivered against Dan Quayle by Lloyd Bentsen who, despite that exocet remark, went on to lose with Michael Dukakis the 1988 election.</p> <p>Barnett also points out that in last week's debate between Romney and Obama \"there was a clear contrast in major issues and not a lot of focus on one-liners. I think that makes for a better debate, when the discussion is substantive.\"</p> <p>With that in mind, Biden is unlikely to repeat Obama's inexplicable failure to raise the Romney's record at Bain Capital, the asset management firm he set up, and the Republican nominee's <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/09/romney-secret-video-marc-leder-sex-parties\">notorious comments about the dependent 47% of Americans</a>. And there will be plenty to go at in terms of the record of his immediate opponent.</p> <p>As an avowed policy wonk who refers to himself as a \"PowerPoint guy\", Ryan, 42, brings to the debate a wealth of policy formulations that give him impressive Beltway credentials but leave him exposed to Democratic attack.</p> <p>Top of the pile is the Paul Ryan budget, which runs counter to Romney's claim last week that he intends to leave unchanged taxes for the most wealthy Americans. Ryan's budget, by contrast, calls for a tax cut for the super rich to 25% and an effective increase in taxes for the most poor by removing tax breaks for low-income earners.</p> <p>Then there's Medicare, the national healthcare insurance scheme for over-65s, which Ryan has proposed essentially to privatise for anyone under 55. He's been similarly bold in his thinking about Medicaid, the national health insurance scheme for poor families, drawing up plans that independent analysts have suggested would lead to the slashing of the Medicaid budget by a third over the next decade.</p> <p>West expects Biden, in addition, to raise Ryan's controversial views on abortion \u2013 another area in which the running mate sits uneasily with the new, moderate Romney that was unveiled in Denver last week. All Biden has to do is point out that Ryan backed legislation that would grant a fertilised egg the full legal rights of a person, and that his co-sponsor of the bill was none other than Todd Akin, the Missouri Republican who in August astonished the world with his statement that women who had been \"legitimately\" raped rarely got pregnant.</p> <p>\"The abortion issue is a good way for Biden to reach out to women voters who are wavering in their support for Obama,\" West said.</p> <p>One thing that Biden cannot assume, however, is that Ryan will be taken off guard by questions surrounding his positions. Though inexperienced in national debating, the Wisconsin congressman has been engaged for days in his own deep debate prep and has said he is braced for Biden going on the offensive. \"I expect the vice-president to come at me like a cannonball,\" <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/paul-ryan-readies-debate-biden_653713.html\">he told the conservative Weekly Standard</a>.</p> <p>It all makes for a potentially barnstorming debate after the rather drab presidential affair last week. Joe Biden has achilles heels aplenty, but being dull is not one of them.</p>",
  "<p>A hi-tech fingerprint scanner unlocks the entrance to Jean Gatabazi's offices at the hospital in the Rwandan town of Nyamata. Gatabazi says the past five years have brought a tarmac road, street lighting and thriving businesses to the site of one of the worst massacres of the 1994 genocide. And he knows whom he credits for the transformation. \"Paul Kagame is an excellent man,\" he says proudly. \"Hero is the right word.\"</p> <p>President Kagame has similarly mesmerised Tony Blair (who called him a \"visionary leader\"), Bill Clinton (\"one of the greatest leaders of our time\"), Clare Short (\"such a sweetie\") and Howard Schultz, chief executive of Starbucks, who was persuaded to invest here. Such idolatry raises the question, what spell does this flinty statesman with bookish, even nerdy looks, with no obvious charisma, cast over western leaders \u2013 and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/25/paul-kagame-rwanda-us-britain\" title=\"\">why is it now wearing thin</a>?</p> <p>Everything in Rwanda must be seen through the prism of the genocide, a hundred apocalyptic days that wiped out 800,000 men, women, children and babies and left no family unscarred. As a guerrilla commander who marched from the bush to the capital, Kigali, it was Kagame who ended the nightmare and, his champions say, tilted the scales more towards reconciliation than revenge. \"I'm not sure Rwanda would exist if not for him right now,\" one expat businessman said.</p> <p>At first glance, it is not hard to see why visitors are seduced by Kagame's Rwanda. Whatever post-traumatic disorders have been buried in the collective unconscious over 18 years, on the surface, life is orderly, pavements are clean and roads are free from the potholes that curse much of Africa. Kigali is nurturing a reputation as the safest city on the continent. American aid workers, entrepreneurs and tourists have poured in to a version of Africa that is both user-friendly and authentic.</p> <p>In the past decade, primary school attendance has trebled, child mortality has halved and parliament has achieved the highest proportion of female members in the world. Last week saw the opening of the <a href=\"http://www.kigalilibrary.org\" title=\"\">country's first public library</a>, its generous windows looking out directly on the US embassy. Kagame's wife, Jeannette, took a tour of the airy $3.5m (\u00a32.2m) building and heard from articulate 12-year-olds enjoying the fastest growing <a href=\"http://one.laptop.org/map/rwanda\" title=\"\">One Laptop Per Child</a> project in Africa.</p> <p>It is no wonder that Rwanda is held up as a prime example of how donor support can work, proving a handy riposte to the aid sceptics who would slash the department for international development's budget. Kagame, 54, has been seen as a visionary, the face of a new, self-confident, economically vibrant African narrative that buries the passivity and victimhood of the past.</p> <p>In addition, some say, this might go some way to paying off western guilt over failing to intervene during the genocide. \"Clinton and Blair may be looking back to their time in the 90s and thinking, 'What could we have done differently, how can we put it right?'\" one observer remarked.</p> <p>But in recent years, there has been a slow, sickening realisation that the west's favourite African leader comes with a sinister edge. Kagame's Rwanda, say critics, is an authoritarian state where democracy and human rights are trampled upon and dissenters are hunted down. When Kagame won the 2010 election with 93% of the vote, for example, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2010/jul/18/paul-kagame-rwanda-profile\" title=\"\">three major opposition parties were excluded from the ballot</a>. Two of their leaders were jailed and still languish there today.</p> <p>The third, Frank Habineza of the Democratic Green party, was also arrested briefly then went into exile after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/14/rwanda-opposition-politician-found-dead\" title=\"\">his deputy, Andr\u00e9 Kagwa Rwisereka, was found dead</a>, nearly decapitated. \"It broke our hearts,\" recalled Habineza, who returned home last month after two years in Sweden. \"He was a man who came to our house to share a meal and was close to my family. It was a terrible death. I went to the mortuary to dress him for the burial. It was an intimate moment. It shattered us but we have to pull ourselves together.\"</p> <p>Habineza, who received death threats after breaking away from Kagame's ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), feels frustrated at international donors' failure to push for genuine democracy. \"I requested Britain and others to take action regarding political space in Rwanda, but what they are doing, I don't understand. If the international community took a stand on political space and democracy, that would be the most helpful to us.\"</p> <p>Habineza welcomed the work of Blair's <a href=\"http://www.africagovernance.org/africa/pages/rwanda\" title=\"\">African Governance Initiative in Rwanda</a>, but added: \"I ask him to always request President Kagame to look at these issues: democracy and economic development go hand in hand. We are saying Rwanda is ready for democracy. Tony Blair should tell him this. There cannot be democracy in a country where there is no opposition party and no freedom of expression.\"</p> <p>In the past few years, several journalists have been arrested or killed, an exiled general survived a shooting in Johannesburg, and Scotland Yard warned two Rwandans living in Britain that \"the Rwandan government poses an imminent threat to your life\". A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/08/rwandan-civilians-claim-torture\" title=\"\">report this week by Amnesty International</a> identified a series of unlawful detentions and torture including electric shocks. Coincidence? Kagame's government insists the incidents must be examined one by one. His critics join the dots and find a pattern that includes state-sponsored death squads.</p> <p>Jean Baptiste Icyitonderwa, general secretary of Social Party Imberakuri, claims its leader has been tortured in jail. \"As a person in an opposition party, you can't trust your own security,\" he said. \"Many times you hear some leader of the opposition parties got arrested, killed and some others disappeared, others are persecuted. That means no one who belongs to an opposition party can feel safe.\"</p> <p>Boniface Twagirimana, vice-president of the United Democratic Forces party, whose leader is also behind bars, said: \"President Kagame is a dictator. He's operating like he's still in the forest as a rebel. He's not a president for the whole country, only RPF members. He doesn't want to open the political space to allow freedom of expression.\"</p> <p>Kagame has pledged to step down in 2017, the end of his second term. But Twagirimana is doubtful. \"Maybe they will change the constitution so he can continue. I think he would like to rule for 20, 30, 50 years like Robert Mugabe.\"</p> <p>Some observers argue that the RPF government is torn between a faction of military hardliners, who regard repression as a small price to pay for post-genocide peace between Hutus and&#xa0;Tutsis, and a more liberal wing sensitive to democratic concerns. Kagame, the military man turned statesman, faces a constant battle to balance the&#xa0;two.</p> <p>He recently responded to critics of restrictions on free speech by invoking Holocaust denialism. \"They are mainly talking about laws related to genocide ideology, which I am more than happy to defend,\" he told the US Metro newspaper. \"<a href=\"http://www.metro.us/newyork/international/article/1150774--exclusive-interview-paul-kagame-president-of-rwanda\" title=\"\">Rwandans will not tolerate voices that promote a return to the ethnic divisionism that precipitated the genocide 18 years ago</a>. To that extent, we place limits on freedom of expression in a similar way to how much of Europe has made it a crime to deny the Holocaust. Aside from that, Rwanda is a very open and free country.\"</p> <p>Kagame's government claims the west should not impose its own notions of democracy on Africa. His supporters include Gerald Mpyisi, managing director of the Institute of Management and Leadership, who said: \"The president is running the country like a CEO of a company who ensures that every director is accountable for their department. That is why, despite the lack of resources, you still find things happening.</p> <p>\"I believe for a country in the third world to develop there has to be a certain element of organising the population. The west tries to use its standards in the developing world and it isn't fair.\"</p> <p>If Rwanda had remained a kind of African Singapore, the west might have continued to turn a blind eye. But this year, it seems, the mask has finally slipped. In June, UN monitors accused Kagame of meddling in his mineral-rich neighbour the Democratic Republic of the Congo, supporting a rebellion led by a war crimes suspect and blamed for atrocities including mass rapes. Evidence gathered by Human Rights Watch supports the claim, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/28/congo-warlord-rwanda-kagame-defies-un\" title=\"\">which Rwanda fiercely denies</a>.</p> <p>International donors finally had no choice but to rap Kagame on the knuckles. His domestic opponents now want them to go further. Twagirimana said: \"The money given by the UK should be stopped. It is being used to run the army and fund the campaign in Congo. In a country without a democratic system, it is not difficult to use the money how you want. That is why the money is being used to kill people in Congo and Britain should stop its support.\"</p> <p>Human Rights Watch is a constant thorn in Kagame's side. Its researcher Carina Tertsakian was in effect expelled from Rwanda before the last election. \"Paul Kagame is a figure that seems to fascinate people,\" she said. \"He's been very clever and western governments have been very gullible in buying it and ignoring the violations and abuses. But by 2010 even the British government had to acknowledge things were not quite right. We are now seeing the Rwandan PR machine come unstuck.\"</p>",
  "<p>For the naval officers lounging onboard the Argentinian naval vessel ARA Libertad, there could perhaps be worse places to be stranded than the bustling port of Tema, on Ghana's Atlantic coast.</p> <p>But the crew of the three-masted ship may be forced to prolong their stay indefinitely amid a legal dispute between the government of Argentina and a US-based \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/vulture-funds\" title=\"\">vulture fund</a>\".</p> <p>The Ghanaian high court will on Thursday begin hearing a case to determine whether the Libertad is allowed to sail on, or forced to stay in Tema until the Argentinian government pays up $1.6bn claimed by US-based investment fund NML Capital.</p> <p>The fund \u2013 backed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/nov/15/vulture-funds-key-players\" title=\"\">US billionaire Paul Singer</a> \u2013 is suing Argentina on the basis of debts arising from the country's defaulted bond swaps in 2005 and 2010. NML Capital bought bonds from the heavily indebted Argentinian government in 2000, a year before the country's $100bn sovereign default saw most of its debt restructured.</p> <p>The Libertad was detained after the fund \u2013 which has obtained judgments in New York and London awarding it more than $1.6bn (\u00a31bn) from Argentina \u2013 applied to the Ghanaian courts. Previous attempts to seize sovereign assets, including the Argentinian presidential jet, have so far been successfully avoided.</p> <p>\"NML already have five judgments against Argentina, but the problem is you get judgment but there are no assets to enforce it,\" a source close to the case told the Guardian.</p> <p>\"So the lawyers chose Ghana because Argentina had the Libertad \u2013 an asset within the jurisdiction.\"</p> <p>\" Argentina is not even flying its presidential plane anywhere until it has the assurance of the destination country that they are not going to seize it at the request of NML.\"</p> <p>The case has reignited criticism of international investors like Singer, who buy up foreign debt default. Argentina's President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez often lashes out at funds like NML, describing them as \"vultures\" preying on debtor countries.</p> <p>\"The vulture funds have crossed a new line in their attack against Argentina,\" said the foreign ministry in a statement, pledging to \"clear up this hoax staged by unscrupulous financiers\".</p> <p>Although Argentina has little trade with Ghana and no embassy there, the two nations have \u2013 until now \u2013 had friendly ties.</p> <p>\"The Fragata Libertad was visiting the port of Tema upon the official invitation of the government of Ghana,\" said Arturo Antonio Puricelli, Argentinian minister of defence, in a written statement filed before the Ghana high court. Argentina argues the action is a breach of warship immunity under international law, and is expected to argue that the Libertad should be immediately released.</p> <p>\"The annual voyages around the world of the Libertad serve the important role of promoting goodwill relations between the republic and other nations like Ghana,\" said Puricelli. \"Any delays in leaving the port of Tema will jeopardise this official schedule and put at risk the training voyage and mission.\"</p> <p>This is not the first time Singer has clashed with a debt-ridden South American economy. The 68-year-old founder of a $19bn hedge fund called Elliott Management hit the headlines in the late 1990s when he bought debt that Peru had defaulted on for $11.4bn and took the country to court demanding full payment. After a hard-fought legal battle Singer emerged the victor with a $58m payoff.</p> <p>In another case Elliott went after the government of Congo-Brazzaville, uncovering corruption during the court case that eventually forced the government to settle for an estimated $90m on debt for which Elliott paid less than $20m.</p> <p>But it was the financial crisis that made him. In 2006 Singer was warning that banks were creating \"radioactive\" investments from subprime mortgages and other investments that could trigger a global financial crisis. Elliott correctly made a bet that this would be the case, adding to a personal fortune now estimated to be over $1bn. Singer, a prominent backer of the Republican party, has donated $1m to Mitt Romney's election campaign.</p> <p>Ghanaians are also questioning their role in the saga, as the economic consequences of the Libertad's detention at Tema begin to be felt in the west African country.</p> <p>\"This is creating problems for us,\" said Lawrence Atumbine of the Ghana port and harbour authority. \"The berth the Libertad is occupying is where we handle local vessels to be offloaded. It is a very large vessel \u2013 104 metres \u2013 and we cannot use the berth whilst it is there.\"</p> <p>Naval officers on board the Libertad, which serves as a school ship in the Argentian navy, refused to comment on the case but expressed surprise at the court order detaining the ship.</p> <p>\"We are ambassadors and we stay here to build better relationships with the countries we visit,\" said Lu\u00eds Melic\u00e1n, chief of communications on board the Libertad.</p> <p>\"But we have been visiting lots of tourist sites whilst the ship is held in the port. We have been to hotel swimming pools and we have been going to the mall. It's not too bad for us.\"</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney's campaign was in difficulty again on Wednesday over their candidate's position on abortion after a newspaper interview in which Romney said that legislation to restrict abortion was \"not part of my agenda\".</p> <p>After spending months reassuring conservative voters that he was staunchly against abortion, Romney appeared to soften that stance <a href=\"http://blogs.desmoinesregister.com/dmr/index.php/2012/10/09/romney-says-abortion-legislation-isnt-part-of-his-agenda\">in an interview with the Des Moines Register</a> on Tuesday. \"There is no legislation with regards to abortion that I'm familiar with that would become part of my agenda,\" he said.</p> <p>Within hours of the comments being published, Romney's campaign insisted that he was against abortion, telling the conservative National Review Online that Romney \"would, of course, support legislation aimed at providing greater protections for life.</p> <p>\"Mitt Romney is proudly pro-life, and he will be a pro-life president,\" said his spokeswoman Andrea Saul in a statement.</p> <p>Romney's comments drew fire from both sides on Wednesday, with Democrats accusing him of playing politics and hiding his real beliefs to attract female voters, and conservatives reminding him of his federal responsibilities over what remains a controversial issue.</p> <p>His remarks to the Iowa newspaper were <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/10/1142538/-Romney-debates-himself-on-abortion\">initially seized on by Democrats</a> as evidence of a change of heart. On hearing them, Bill Clinton told a campaign rally of 2,000 supporters: \"I thought, 'Wow, here's old moderate Mitt. Where ya been, boy?'\"</p> <p>But by Wednesday, Obama's campaign team was trying to portray Romney not as a flip-flopper, but as someone who cannot be trusted to voice his true beliefs.</p> <p>Democrats said his statement contradicted his pledge to appoints supreme court justices who would overturn Roe v Wade, the landmark 1972 decision which confirmed a woman's federal right to abortion.</p> <p>Stephanie Cutter, the Obama campaign's deputy press secretary, told reporters: \"We're not saying that he's changed his mind on these issues. We're saying that he is trying to cover up his beliefs.\"</p> <p>She added: \"Every step of the way he has been anti-choice, against Roe v Wade.\"</p> <p>Reaction among conservatives to Romney's remarks was also critical. A comment piece in <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/obamacare-provides-taxpayer-funding-elective-abortions_654076.html\">the conservative newspaper The Weekly Standard</a> on Wednesday titled \"Did Mitt Romney forget?\" suggested that he was \"mistaken\" and had simply not realised how many issues related to abortion funding he could influence.</p> <p>\"The issue here does not appear to be that Romney is backing off his stance on abortion \u2013 indeed, he says he will use an executive order to cut off funding to groups that perform abortion overseas,\" it read. \"But he is mistaken in thinking that there aren't issues related to abortion-funding are handled through the legislative process at the federal level.\"</p> <p>Romney's past commitments have included ensuring US laws reflect \"values of preserving life. He has previously promised to: support foetal pain legislation, which bans abortion after 20 weeks, on the much-debated basis that foetuses can feel pain at that stage; end public health funds for Planned Parenthood because the group provides abortions; and support a decades-old ban on federal funds for abortions.</p> <p>He supports the reversal of Roe v Wade, but believes in exceptions for victims of rape and incest, or when the mother's life is in danger.</p> <p>Romney, who had been pro-choice as governor of Massachusetts, repeatedly asserted his anti-abortion credentials as he battled to win the Republican nomination. During a televised debate in Charleston on 19 January before the South Carolina primary, for example, he said: \"You can count on me as president of the United States to pursue a policy that protects the life of the unborn, whether here in this country or overseas. And I'll reverse the policies of this president.\"</p> <p>In his acceptance speech to the Republican convention in Tampa in August, he promised that as president he would \"protect the sanctity of life\".</p> <p>His position on abortion also came under the spotlight when he selected Paul Ryan as his running mate. The Wisconsin congressman is against abortion, even in cases of rape and incest, or when the mother's life is in danger. He has sponsored a series of bills that would either restrict abortion or access to contraception, or both.</p> <p>Rick Perry, the Texas governor and a staunch pro-life advocate, said he was untroubled by Romney's initial remarks. He said on Wednesday that he was confident Romney will appoint \"constitutionalists\" to the supreme court.</p> <p>\"I think the supreme court is where that issue will be decided, from the standpoint of how America's going \u2013 we'll have a supreme court decision, and that's where the focus will be,\" Perry said on CBS This Morning. \"He's said very clearly that he's going to put people who are constitutionalists on the supreme court.\"</p> <p>Romney's comments came as he sought to maintain his recent appeal to female voters in the closing stages of the presidential race. A poll by Pew this week found Romney neck-and-neck among women with Barack Obama, who has held an enormous advantage with this demographic.</p>",
  "<p>The international community has failed to defend democracy in Maldives, said Mohamed Nasheed the ousted president of the Indian Ocean island state.</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian a day after his release from detention, Nasheed, who was forced out in what supporters say was a coup earlier this year, said it was difficult for him to believe that \"democracy is sacred for the international community\".</p> <p>\"The people of the Maldives have lost faith with the international community \u2026 which has taken a very narrow view,\" said Nasheed, an internationally respected environmental activist who was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/nov/25/david-cameron-answers-questions\" title=\"\">described by David Cameron as his \"new best mate\"</a> in November 2011.</p> <p>Nasheed, who became the first democratically elected leader of the Maldives in 2008, resigned as president in February in a confused episode during which he says he was forced to relinquish power at gunpoint.</p> <p>International reaction has been relatively muted and Nasheed's overseas trips to Europe and elsewhere have failed to elicit the support his supporters had hoped for. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/08/maldives-mohamed-nasheed-arrested\" title=\"\">Arrested on Monday on Fares-Mathoda island</a>, in the Gaaf Dhaal atoll, about 440km away from the capital Mal\u00e9 after twice refusing summons to court to face charges linked to the controversial arrest of a senior judge while he was in power, Nasheed was held for 24 hours.</p> <p>Speaking after his release he said the charges were aimed at ensuring he cannot contest new presidential polls set to be held next year. A trial date has now been set in early November.</p> <p>\"It is very certain that they can't win [the election] with me [standing] as a candidate so they are trying all sorts of ways to stop me \u2026 It is really quite chilling,\" said the 45-year-old veteran political activist.</p> <p>Officials from the government of President Mohammed Waheed Hassan, who took power when Nasheed resigned in February, maintain their actions have been constitutional. An inquiry commission concluded that Nasheed left office legally. Abbas Riza, spokesman for the current president, has said everything had been done \"according to the country's law\".</p> <p>However, Amnesty International has described events in the Maldives as a \"human rights crisis\", reporting widespread police brutality and arbitrary arrests.</p> <p>Nasheed, 45, said his party, the Maldivian Democratic Party, would be forced to boycott polls to be held next year if, as appears likely, he is convicted and thus barred as a candidate. Such a boycott would seriously undermine the credibility of any election. The MDP has held frequent protests in recent months demanding polls. President Hassan has said he will hold elections in July 2013, the earliest time permitted by the constitution.</p>",
  "<p>Newly energised Republicans are turning out in droves for Mitt Romney in the state that could decide the election, Ohio, as previously confident Democratic activists have begun to display signs of nervousness.</p> <p>At a rally at Cuyahoga Falls on Tuesday night, Romney attracted one of the biggest turnouts of his campaign so far, an estimated 12,000, with thousands more stuck outside, unable to get through security in time.</p> <p>The response of the crowds so far is a long way from 'Romneymania' but there are strong signs of growing Republican confidence as a result of last week's debate and the narrowing of the polls. The crowd, responding to Obama supporters' chants at rallies of \"four more years\", shouted: \"four more weeks\".</p> <p>Republicans in the crowd attributed the rejuvenation of his campaign to Obama's poor debate performance and his subsequent polling slide.<br>Such is the importance of Ohio that Romney is spending four out of the next five days campaigning in the crucial state.</p> <p>With fewer than four weeks left until election day, Obama has recognised the urgency of the situation, curtailing fundraising events and concentrating on debate preparation and rallies in swing states such as Ohio.</p> <p>In a radio interview Obama urged his supporters to stay focused even though he admitted he lost his first debate because he said he \"was just too polite.\"</p> <p>Obama said the race was bound to be close after Americans have \"just gone through four really tough years.\"</p> <p>\"Governor Romney kept on making mistakes month after month so it made it look artificially like this was, might end up being a cakewalk,\" Obama said. \"But we understood internally that it never would be.\"</p> <p>The president predicted, \"By next week, I think a lot of the hand-wringing will be complete because we're going to go ahead and win this thing.\" </p> <p>Polls have shown Obama's previous leads have evaporated and he and Romney are now tied nationally at 47%. Obama's lead in Ohio, where he had been enjoying leads of up to eight points, has been cut to about four points, according to the latest CNN/Orc poll.</p> <p>Democratic activists on the ground in Ohio say the state will be decided by who gets the vote out on the day, anticipating that Republican turnout will be high, as it is traditionally. One organiser, preparing for a big door-to-door campaign effort this weekend, admitted that the numbers of volunteers for Obama is down this year on 2008. \"I think the elections are riding on these debates. If Obama does well, we will bring it home,\" he said.</p> <p>He was not sure why the number of volunteers is down, whether there was just not the same sense of excitement as in 2008 or if it was the result of disillusionment. He is hoping it is because Democrats thought the election was already won in Ohio, and that the tightening of the polls will see a big volunteer turnout this weekend.</p> <p>Ohio is one of the eight swing states but no Republican has won the White House without taking it. Without winning the state, it will be difficult for Romney to accumulate the number of votes he needs.</p> <p>A large turn-out of Democratic supporters is needed in working-class cities in the north of Ohio to counterbalance Republican support in the largely rural areas to the south.</p> <p>Democrats, as well as being worried about Obama, are also concerned about the fate of Democratic senator Sherrod Brown, who is up for re-election. </p> <p>Although he is the favourite to win, it is proving to be a closer race than Democrats expected and Republicans have spent $20m to oust him, more than any other Senate race.</p> <p>The Ohio govenor, John Kasich, in a conference call with reporters on Tuesday, attributed the Republican resurgence to Romney's debate performance. \"There isn't any question that he has breathed new life and new energy into the Republican party,\" Kasich said. \"We're seeing that there is greater intensity among Republicans and a great willingness to get out and vote and participate than we're seeing with Democrats.\"</p> <p>Romney, campaigning in Ohio with New Jersey governor Chris Christie and senator Rob Portman \u2013 who plays the part of Obama during debate preparation \u2013 appears more confident at the podium after months in which he often attracted meagre crowds of a few hundred.</p> <p>At the Cuyahoga Falls rally, Kate Paul, 25, a teacher from Canton, said: \"I think a lot of people are still curious about the candidate. Some people are still curious about the candidates. Some people are still figuring it out. The majority are not.</p> <p>\"I was not sure about Romney at first but the debate sealed the deal.\"</p> <p>Some of the crowd expressed confidence that the tightening of the polls would turn out to be more than a short-lived bounce.</p> <p>Karla Shott, 61, from Akron, said: \"I think the polls are more than a bounce. A lot of people's eyes were opened during the debate.\" Asked about Romney's chances in Ohio, Shott said: \"I feel better than I did before last Wednesday.\"</p> <p>The impact of the debate was evident when Romney referred to it in his speech, securing the biggest cheer of the evening.</p> <p>Another Romney supporter, Michael Battaglia, 71, from Cuyahoga Falls, said the election could turn into a landslide. Battaglia, who converts retro cars from petrol so they can run on both petrol and natural gas, said: \"Supposedly the [Romney] campaign had scratched Ohio but they have seen a grassroots resurgence. The polls in Michigan are tightening too.\"</p> <p>He added: \"A lot of people are scared of being called racist. I think Obama is a poor leader and I think there are a lot of African Americans who could run the country better.\"</p> <p>Cara Moorhead, 26, a paralegal from Cuyahoga Falls, who supported Romney in 2008, said she had come to the rally \"to witness history, to see the next US president\".</p>",
  "<p>Buzz Bissinger, the sports journalist who rose to fame by writing a book about Texas high school football that later was adapted into the critically acclaimed TV show \"Friday Night Lights\", made headlines this week with <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/10/08/buzz-bissinger-why-i-m-voting-for-mitt-romney.html\">a pitiful rationalization of his choice</a> to turn his back on his own Democratic values and, instead, vote for Mitt Romney for president. Bissinger denied that his change of heart owed anything to the massive tax cuts that he, as a now wealthy man, would be getting under President Romney, but since the rest of his piece didn't really make much sense, he'll have to forgive the rest of us if we don't believe his claims to be anything less than mercenary. </p> <p>Needless to say, the Romney campaign has wasted no time in appropriating the slogan of the fictional Dillon Panthers football team, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/from-a-tv-show-romneys-new-unofficial-slogan-clear-eyes-full-hearts-america-cant-lose/2012/10/10/6b9f8ad0-12a8-11e2-9a39-1f5a7f6fe945_story.html\">gleefully pasting \"Clear Eyes, Full Hearts, Can't Lose\"</a> into every release and email. To fans of the TV show, it's hard not to imagine that this would not earn a long hard stare from Coach Taylor.</p> <p>Well, Bissinger made his fortune off my people, so I suppose that gives me the right to have a say in all this. Bissinger came out to west Texas to chronicle the world I grew up in, where the miles of highway isolate them from the rest of the world, which is why the culture is built around those Friday night high school football games. The area is incredibly conservative, but because of this, it profoundly illustrates the failures of the ideology of men like Mitt Romney. </p> <p>That's what made the show \"Friday Night Lights\" work so well. Without hitting you over the head with it, it was clear the writers and producers understood that decades of conservatism have left west Texas poverty-ridden and abandoned. The entire job of the beloved main characters on the show, Eric and Tami Taylor, was to get their students into a place where they could get out of west Texas. The reason was implicitly understood: there is no hope for a better life if you stay in west Texas. You need to get out \u2013 preferably, to some place that elects Democrats and therefore still has the well-funded infrastructure that gives ordinary people an opportunity to better themselves.</p> <p>If, on the other hand, you want a full eyeball of what a Republican paradise looks like, you would do well to go to west Texas, where a handful of people live in lavish homes while everyone else gets by on dismally low wages. Indeed, my boyfriend would often complain as we drove through the area to visit my parents after I, like the teenage characters on \"Friday Night Lights\", had got out. The routes I would drive took us through so much rural blight and jaw-dropping poverty that it can induce depression if you're not used to it.</p> <p>The show gets this. The fictional Taylors get it, which is why they were subtly drawn as the sort of Texans who quietly vote for Democrats while socializing with the Republicans who run the football boosters. (Indeed, the county I grew up in has enough of these folks that it broke for Obama in 2008, after voting for Bush in 2004.) I thought Bissinger got it, too, but as becomes clear from reading his piece, he doesn't really get politics nearly as well as he seems to think he does. After all, he claims, without much in the way of real evidence, that Romney is a moderate and will govern as a moderate. </p> <p>In reality, even if Romney were personally moderate (doubtful, if you <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/post/romney-under-fire-for-pac-donation-to-anti-gay-marriage-group/2012/03/30/gIQAm7QolS_blog.html\">look at his political donations</a>), he will be working with a Congress run by Republicans who have such a rightwing agenda that they have already threatened twice to shut down the federal government, once by trying to get us to default on our loan payments. Even if Romney wanted to govern like a moderate, the party he'd lead as president would not let him. </p> <p>Bissinger tries to wiggle out of responsibility for promoting poverty by voting Republican by claiming that Obama has abandoned the poor anyway, citing the president's inability to turn around the city of Camden in four short years as evidence, as if the many decades of mostly-Republican rule have no bearing on the fate of declining American cities \u2013 and as if Camden itself were not in a state with a Republican governor, Chris Christie. But <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/opinion/sunday/republicans-to-cities-drop-dead.html?hp\">as Kevin Baker explored in depth</a> in the New York Times this past weekend, Republicans have been undermining urban America for decades now. Indeed, Romney himself made it clear how he views the problem of cities in need of assistance and renewal when he argued against the auto bailout in 2008, with a column headlined <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/19/opinion/19romney.html\">\"Let Detroit Go Bankrupt\"</a>.</p> <p>Is there more Obama could be doing to help cities in crisis? Yes, but unlike Romney, he actually does something to help them, instead of letting them collapse in on themselves. </p> <p>The fact of the matter is that Republican antipathy towards infrastructure, regulation, and the social safety net is bad for both rural and urban America. The only people that Republican policies help in the long run are the wealthiest, who get the bulk of the tax cuts that are paid for by letting our cities rot and our small towns fall apart as young people flee, usually to liberal strongholds that resist the decline by investing on a local level. </p> <p>I wish Tami Taylor could sit Bissinger down at her kitchen table and explain that while he will no doubt enjoy the tax cuts his wealth will earn him under Romney, good people just don't turn their backs on their community like that. The Romney campaign may be using the Dillon Panthers' motto, but really, a more accurate Texasism would be:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I got mine, so screw y'all.</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>In the battle for northern Syria the most important front is far from Aleppo. It is across the border in the southern Turkish town of Antakya. Here rebels, who now move around with increasing ease, are engaged in daily bids for patronage with those who keep the insurgency running.</p> <p>Over the past year, and especially since May, when weapons started to arrive, Bashar al-Assad's enemies have met their benefactors in Antakya's backstreets, coffee shops and hotel lobbies and made a case as to why they should receive help.</p> <p>The rivalries of Arab and Gulf politics, divisions between the west and Russia, fear of Syria's bloody crisis spreading beyond the country's borders to drag in Iran or Lebanon all make supplying arms to the rebels a sensitive and murky issue.</p> <p>Now, it seems, the supply is drying up. On Aleppo's frontlines, there is still no sign of the heavy weapons for which the rebels have pleaded. Ammunition is running low. \"They are giving us enough to keep this fight going, but not enough to win it,\" complained Abu Furat, a commander. \"I'm sure that's not going to change until after the American elections. I'm not sure everyone can survive until then.\"</p> <p>The men with the money and influence in Antakya are envoys sent by the Sunni world's political elite or business leaders. One name comes up more than any other \u2013 a Lebanese MP named Okab Sakr.</p> <p>\"Every time Okab is in town the weapons start to move across the border,\" said a rebel colonel from the Jebel al-Zawiya region, who calls himself Abu Wael. \"The problem is he is very particular about where those weapons go.\"</p> <p>Sakr is a member of the Future movement of the Lebanese opposition leader, Saad Hariri. According to colleagues in Beirut he has been given the role of gun runner-in-chief. Sakr has become a polarising figure among Syria's fragmented opposition; those he supplies see him as a saviour; those who miss out hold him responsible for the faltering rebel cause.</p> <p>Dissatisfaction with Sakr's role goes further. The US, always jittery about backing the uprising, is opposed to calls by Saudi Arabia and Qatar to supply rebel groups with equipment needed to combat aircraft and tanks \u2013 an issue raised by Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney on Monday. Jordan and Turkey appear to share Washington's concerns. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/10/us-troops-jordan-syria-crisis\" title=\"\">Confirmation</a> on Wednesday that the US had sent a military mission to Jordan to help build a headquarters on the border with Syria and to improve Jordan's military capabilities underlines worries about possible spillover.</p> <p>\"It's about indirect intervention,\" said Mustafa Alani of the Saudi-financed Gulf Research Centre in Abu Dhabi. \"The money is there, arms can be supplied. But the Jordanians and the Turks are hesitant. Turkey is allowing some weapons in but there are a lot of restrictions. People are waiting for a shift after the US election.\"</p> <p>Another growing problem is a lack of co-ordination between Qatar and the Saudis \u2013 the likely subject of Wednesday's talks in Doha between the Emir and the Saudi intelligence chief, Prince Bandar. King Abdullah is said to be growing impatient with the difficulties of the Syrian crisis. According to Syrian opposition activists, the Saudis now sponsor only rebel groups which are at odds with those backed by Qatar and Turkey, which are often linked to the Muslim Brotherhood.</p> <p>\"The Qataris are much more proactive than the Saudis,\" said one well-placed Arab source. \"The Saudis are not interested in democracy, they just want to be rid of Bashar. They would be happy with a Yemeni solution that gets rid of the president and leaves the regime intact.\"</p> <p>Intelligence chiefs from Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and France reportedly met in Turkey in early September along with the CIA director general, David Petraeus. But they apparently failed to reach agreement on a co-ordinated strategy.</p> <p>US officials say the opaque nature of the opposition and the creeping presence of foreign jihadis are behind their pressure on Riyadh and Doha. \"They have both been given a yellow light by the Americans,\" said a Lebanese minister aligned to the Future movement. \"The Saudis see yellow as yellow, but the Qataris have seen it as green. Their connections with and supply to the opposition have continued, perhaps escalated. The Americans are especially against handing out anti-aircraft missiles. They will not accept these things falling into the hands of jihadis. Imagine having to do a Stinger buy-back programme like Afghanistan all over again.\"</p> <p>Now the Saudis are signalling that they are reaching the limits of what they will do in the face of US objections, concern about the resilience of the Assad regime, fears that extremists will dominate the opposition \u2013 as well as the risks of \"blowback\" from jihadis returning home.</p> <p>The initial armed support for the rebels resulted in two substantial shipments of automatic weapons, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenades, delivered in May and June from Turkey. Since then, large-scale gun-running has dried up.</p> <p>\"The Saudis were the most enthusiastic by far about getting weapons to the rebels,\" said a former Lebanese MP. \"They were public about it and committed. That was until July.\" By the middle of that month, foreign jihadis started trickling into Syria looking to join the fray.</p> <p>The rebel military council, a group of defected senior officers, is opposed to the foreigners and wary of Syria's own Islamist groups, who have been organising and arming in the rural areas between Aleppo and Idlib.</p> <p>Riyadh worries too about its home front, where the Syrian issue is kept alive by the likes of Sheikh Adnan Arour, a rabidly sectarian Salafi televangelist. Official media continue to bombard the public with images of atrocities carried out by Alawites \u2013 Assad's ruling sect. But non-establishment clerics who wanted to launch a fundraising drive to aid Syria were ordered to hold off. An official campaign raised more than $100m in a few days.</p> <p>\"The Saudis fear that there will be blowback from Syria like there was from Iraq and Afghanistan,\" said Alani. \"They don't want chaos. They want the Syrian military to take over. The whole region wants that, including the Israelis. Everyone wants an organised structure of army officers who will keep weapons under control and make sure that they are handed in.\"</p> <p>Now the Saudis are pushing the armed Syrian opposition to form a \"salvation front\" with unified command and control on the ground and, crucially, an ability to collect weapons once fighting has ended \u2013 a lesson learned the hard way from Libya. The Saudis are backing brigadier-general Manaf Tlass, the most senior defector yet from the military \u2013 from a key Sunni family \u2013 as part of a drive to win over other figures from the Syrian army and security establishment. \"It's no good calling for them to be held accountable for crimes,\" warned Alani. \"They need to be told they will get support.\" Next week the Qataris are hosting a conference to try to unite a host of squabbling opposition groups.</p> <p>But there is little optimism about prospects for any immediate improvement. \"It's all a bit of a mess,\" said analyst Shadi Hamid of the Brookings Institution in Doha. \"Everyone is waiting for someone else to do a better job. It can't be the Saudis or the Qataris or the Turks. It's got to be the Americans. If we are looking at Gulf support it's certainly been a big story, but that's not the reality. There's a big gap between what people think the Gulf countries have been doing and what they are actually doing. Not that many weapons have been delivered.\"</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney hit the campaign trail in Ohio and Virginia this week accusing Barack Obama of waging war on coal. But the real enemy of coal, it turns out, is free enterprise \u2013 and strong competition from another home-grown source of American energy: natural gas.</p> <p>Falling prices for natural gas made it far more economical to burn natural gas instead of coal in the country's power plants over the last few years.</p> <p>Environmental regulations \u2013 a favourite target of Romney \u2013 had little to do with the switch.</p> <p>\"This is not rocket science,\" said Michael Levi, an energy analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations. \"This is not any kind of conspiracy or heavy-handed action by the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency). All it requires is people with calculators making decisions about what to deploy.\"</p> <p>The Republican challenger steps up his campaign as coal defender this week, with appearances in Ohio on Wednesday and Friday.</p> <p>In campaign stops in coal-producing battleground states like Ohio and Virginia, Romney has accused Obama of destroying the industry with burdensome pollution controls.</p> <p>\"I like coal. I'm going to make sure we continue to burn clean coal. People in the coal industry feel like it's getting crushed by your policies,\" Romney told Obama at their first debate.</p> <p>Those feelings apparently are mutual.</p> <p>Coal companies have been among the biggest donors to Romney's campaign. Murray Energy Corp has donated more than $1m to Republican candidates this election cycle. A watchdog group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, on Tuesday accused Murray Energy of forcing miners to donate to the Romney campaign and to take time off without pay to attend a campaign rally.</p> <p>Coal made up about half of America's electricity mix in 2007, according to the Energy Information Administration, the government research agency. Then the price of natural gas fell sharply because of a boom in domestic production.</p> <p>\"There has been a lot of substitution of natural gas for coal,\" said Steve Clemmer, director of energy research for the Union of Concerned Scientists. A run of warmer winters further reduced demand for coal, he added.</p> <p>By 2011, America was generating just 42% of its electricity from coal. By last April that fell further still to 32%, an all-time low. That number has since crept back upwards towards 40%.</p> <p>\"The industry has taken a pretty big hit this year,\" said Mike Mellish, a coal analyst for the EIA. \"We're talking about more than a 10% decline in the power sector over the last year.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, America's fleet of coal-fired power plants is ageing out. Power managers have already announced plans to phase out about 13% of America's coal-fired plants within the next three to five years. Only a handful of new plants are in the works.</p> <p>More coal-fired plants could come off-line if natural gas prices stay low and if the EPA puts in place more rigorous pollution controls. Coal-fired plants also face increasing competition from renewable energy, like hydro, wind and solar, which receive support from state governments, according to EIA projections.</p> <p>By 2035, natural gas plants are expected to account for 60% of new power capacity, according to the EIA. Coal is expected to account for just 7%.</p> <p>The effects of that transition are already visible in battleground states, as power companies on the Atlantic coast and in the mid-west expand their use of natural gas and cut back on coal.</p> <p>Coal companies shuttered plants and laid off workers. Ohio is set to lose a third of its coal-fired plant capacity over the next several years, Mellish said. Alpha Natural Resources in Virginia announced last month it would lay off 1,200 workers \u2013 blaming the slowdown on a \"regulatory environment that's aggressively aimed at constraining the use of coal\".</p> <p>\"The coal industry likes to blame everything on EPA regulations under the Obama administration, and the reality is that there are quite a few other things driving the reduction in coal that are just economic market factors and some policy-related things related to state policy,\" said Clemmer.</p> <p>New pollution controls from the EPA on emissions of mercury and other toxins are not due to come into force until 2015 at the earliest. Although the EPA did tighten standards for greenhouse gas emissions from new coal plants earlier this year existing plants are exempt.</p> <p>But it is unlikely coal will ever dominate America's electricity supply to the same extent again. New gas field technology, such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, make gas-fired power plants half the cost of coal-fired plants.</p> <p>\"As far as the regulations that have been put into place to date they are a small part of the story why coal is not doing as well as it was a few years ago,\" said Levi.</p>",
  "<p>So pervasive and reliable is the rule of elite immunity - even in the face of the most egregious crimes - that one finds extreme examples on a weekly basis. Six weeks ago, the Obama justice department <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/31/obama-justice-department-immunity-bush-cia-torturer\">forever precluded the possibility</a> of criminal accountability for Bush torturers by refusing to bring charges in the only two remaining torture cases, ones involving the deaths of the detainee-victims by torture. </p> <p>The Obama campaign is now running a new campaign ad against Mitt Romney that rails against a litany of Wall Street \"criminals\" and \"gluttons of greed\", but as David Dayen <a href=\"http://news.firedoglake.com/2012/10/09/obama-ad-about-big-bird-cannot-find-one-prominent-wall-street-criminal-prosecuted-by-administration/\">astutely notes</a>, those examples were all imprisoned during the Bush era because the Obama administration has prosecuted no significant Wall Street executives for the 2008 financial collapse and thus have none of their own examples to highlight:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>\"So the Obama campaign could not fill a list of three Wall Street criminals that the Obama Justice Department actually sent to jail. Heck, they couldn't fill a list of one!</p> <p>\"This is despite Eric Holder telling students at Columbia University in February of this year that his Justice Department's record of success on fighting financial fraud crimes 'has been nothing less than historic.' But not historic enough that his boss could point to, well, one Wall Street criminal behind bars as a result of DoJ's actions.</p> <p>That's painfully telling. Nobody from Bank of America or Wells Fargo or Citigroup or JPMorgan Chase or Goldman Sachs or Bear Stearns or Morgan Stanley or Merrill Lynch or even Countrywide or Ameriquest was available to stand in as a 'glutton of greed' in this advertisement. Literally no major figure responsible for the financial crisis has gone to jail. So the campaign has to use two CEOs from a decade-old accounting scandal, and a garden-variety Ponzi schemer.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>And now, the US supreme court <a href=\"http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2012/10/supreme-court-isnt-bothered-nsas-warrantless-wiretapping/57791/\">just consecrated</a> one of the most corrupt acts of the US government over the past decade: its vesting of retroactive legal immunity in the nation's telecom giants after they had been caught red-handed violating multiple US eavesdropping laws. Just as the Obama DOJ forever precluded any legal accountability for Bush-era torturers, the supreme court on Tuesday <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-57529255-83/supreme-court-closes-door-on-warrantless-eavesdropping-suit/\">forever precluded any legal accountability</a> for AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint and other telecoms for their crucial participation in the illegal Bush NSA warrantless eavesdropping program (the Obama DOJ, needless to say, supported the position of the telecoms).</p> <p>When the New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/16/politics/16program.html?pagewanted=all\">revealed</a> on 16 December 2005 that the Bush administration was spying on the telephone calls and emails of American citizens without the warrants required by the criminal law, it exposed lawbreaking not only by government officials but also by the nation's largest telecoms. <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/files/nsa/statutes.pdf\">Multiple laws were in place</a> at the time imposing both criminal and civil liability on telecoms for enabling government spying on the communications of their customers without warrants or other legal authority, and that is exactly what these telecoms did. One former AT&amp;T employee, Mark Klein, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/07/AR2007110700006.html\">publicly described</a> how AT&amp;T had even built a separate room with no purpose but to permit the National Security Agency unfettered access to all of its customers' communications.</p> <p>What was most remarkable about <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/files/nsa/statutes.pdf\">those telecom laws</a> is that - in the wake of the mid-1970s Church Committee investigation finding that the government abused its spying powers to punish and monitor dissidents - those laws were expressly written to prevent telecoms from participating in illegal government spying. They were written with the full participation of telecom lawyers to ensure that the companies' obligations were crystal clear. And most amazingly of all, the laws already contained broad immunity clauses to ensure that telecoms could never be punished for \"good faith\" violations, but rather only for deliberate, knowing violations of the law.</p> <p>When civil liberties groups sued the telecoms on behalf of their customers whose communications had been illegally accessed by the government, federal courts <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/security/2007/10/18/17048/leahy-fisa-cave/\">began ruling against the telecoms</a>, holding that the immunity they already had under the law would be unavailable to them, because the allegations against them amounted to knowing, deliberate violations of the law. As one federal judge put it in refusing to dismiss a lawsuit against AT&amp;T: \"AT&amp;T cannot seriously contend that a reasonable entity in its position could have believed that the alleged domestic dragnet was legal.\"</p> <p>But in the US, large and powerful actors must not be and are not subject to the rule of law. So telecoms <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2007/09/newsweek-secret-lobbying-campaign-your-phone-company-doesnt-want-you-know-about\">hired former government officials</a> from both parties to lobby for them and poured money into the coffers of key Democratic Senators <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2007/10/dem-pushing-spy/\">such as Intelligence Committee Chairman Jay Rockefeller</a> (who became the chief advocate of telecom immunity).</p> <p>In 2008, the industry obtained an extraordinary act of Congress that <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/21/AR2007102101041.html\">gave them the gift of retroactive immunity</a> from all criminal and civil liability for their participation in the illegal eavesdropping programs aimed at Americans on US soil. The immunity was enacted by an overwhelming bipartisan vote, with the support of leading Democrats including Barack Obama, who <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/06/22/moveon-obama-must-keep-hi_n_108514.html\">had promised</a> - when seeking his party's nomination - to filibuster any bill that contained retroactive telecom immunity.</p> <p>Immediately after this immunity was vested, groups which had been suing the telecoms and had their lawsuits terminated by the law, such as Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the ACLU, <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2008/10/17\">challenged the constitutionality of this immunity</a>. They argued, among other things, that retroactive telecom immunity \"violates the federal government's separation of powers as established in the Constitution\" (by having Congress rather than courts resolve cases in favor of telecoms and by allowing executive branch officials full discretion as to which telecoms should be immunized), and \"robs innocent telecom customers of their rights without due process of law\" (by retroactively barring them from seeking justice in court for the violations of their legal rights). </p> <p>Federal courts, needless to say, rejected these claims, dismissed the lawsuits against the telecoms, and upheld the validity of telecom immunity. It was these decisions that the supreme court on Tuesday refused to review, thus forever shielding lawbreaking telecoms from any legal accountability. Thus, the same tribunal that regularly consigns ordinary, powerless Americans to prison for decades for even trivial offenses yet again acts to protect the most powerful actors from any consequences for serious crimes: that is the US justice system in a nutshell.</p> <p>As usual, it is not only the executive branch, Congress and courts which enable this elite immunity, but also the nation's establishment media, which obscures and distorts these issues with flagrantly misleading claims. Yesterday, for instance, CNN <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2012/10/09/justice/court-surveillance/index.html\">purported to report</a> on the supreme court's decision, and told its readers that what \"civil libertarians\" were objecting to was eavesdropping on \"potential terrorists\" [my emphasis]:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday left in place a law that allows the Justice Department to stop suits against telecommunications companies for <em>participating in wiretaps of potential terrorists</em>.</p> <p>\"The ruling was a key setback for civil libertarians challenging the broader powers of government since the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States to use electronic surveillance to track potential threats in the name of national security. . . . </p> <p>\"In this case, Verizon Communications, Sprint Nextel, and AT&amp;T were <em>accused of privacy violations</em> by assisting the government with intelligence gathering following the hijack attacks on New York and Washington.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>This is all patently misleading. Nobody has ever objected to eavesdropping on \"potential terrorists\"; nobody objects to the \"use [of] electronic surveillance to track potential threats in the name of national security\"; and certainly nobody claims there are \"privacy violations\" from eavesdropping on terrorists. </p> <p>The issue is and always has been <em>illegality</em>, not eavesdropping. The objection is not to government eavesdropping itself, but to government eavesdropping in violation of the law, by spying without the court warrants required by that law, a law that <a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1809\">made it a felony</a> - punishable by up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine for each offense - to eavesdrop on Americans without first obtaining permission from a court. Moreover, the problem is not that government spying took place against \"potential terrorists\" but that the communications of <em>all Americans</em> were swept up.</p> <p>George Bush tried to distort objections to his illegal eavesdropping program into objections to \"eavesdropping on the terrorists\", and here we have CNN in its headline and lede perpetuating that same claim. The CNN article does eventually note that \"the law had previously required the government to justify a national security interest before any phone calls and emails originating in another country could be monitored\", that \"a federal judge had to sign any search warrant\" and that \"Bush secretly suspended that requirement following the attacks\" (Bush did not \"secretly suspend that requirement but rather \"secretly broke the law\": presidents do not have the power to \"suspend laws\": that's called \"breaking the law\"). </p> <p>Despite those caveats, the CNN headline and the lede of the article give the clear impression that the objections are to eavesdropping on terrorists, something no sane or rational person could oppose:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397519809\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349878525645/cnn.png\" alt=\"cnn telecoms\" width=\"460\" height=\"377\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>So congratulations are once again in order for AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint and the other national telecom giants. In a country that imprisons more of its ordinary citizens than any other on the planet by far, and that imposes more unforgiving punishments than any other western nation, our most powerful corporate actors once again find total impunity even for the most serious of lawbreaking.</p> <h2>Skepticism of US journalists</h2> <p>Relating to all of this, I had what I considered to be a quite revealing Twitter exchange this morning with the New York Times' Matthew Rosenberg, who covers Afghanistan for that paper. Rosenberg intervened in a discussion of US drones in Pakistan by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mrosenbergNYT/status/256025144877805568\">vehemently</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mrosenbergNYT/status/256024348471721985\">denouncing</a> the Pakistani government for \"outright, unabashed lies\", and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mrosenbergNYT/status/256024635559247872\">then arguing</a>: \"it's problematic to base analysis off statements from [a government] that repeatedly misleads in public.\"</p> <p>When I asked him whether he would apply those same notes of skepticism to the US government, he repeatedly refused to answer, both in response to my question and those from others. He just kept insisting that the issue was irrelevant. But how could it possibly be that Pakistan's propensity to lie is relevant to the drone debate, but the US government's propensity to do so is irrelevant? That's particularly striking given the <a href=\"http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2011/07/18/washingtons-untrue-claims-no-civilian-deaths-in-pakistan-drone-strikes/\">clear documentation</a> that top US government officials have lied about US drones. I have posted all the relevant Twitter comments <a href=\"http://ggsidedocs.blogspot.com.br/2012/10/twitter-exchange-with-nyts-matthew.html\">here</a>.</p> <p>Apparently, like so many US journalists, Rosenberg is quite willing and eager to publicly denounce foreign government leaders as liars and to insist that their statements on drones must be taken with great skepticism, but - as an American reporter working for a US newspaper writing about US policy - he refuses to say the same about his own government (he did eventually say that all government claims should be treated with skepticism). Rosenberg has actually done some good journalism, but that double standard perfectly captures the role many establishment journalism plays in the US.</p>",

I voted for Obama mostly because I knew he could handle the evolving economic crisis better than McCain. I did not expect the world economy to recover from the crisis at all. I'm surprised that we are not in a depression today and I believe Obama and Bernanke are responsible for keeping depression at bay. </p> <p><strong>NOW:</strong> Today, I still work at the same job I started in 2008, after surviving multiple layoffs. My pay is lower due to \"pension reform\". The reduction in take home pay due to increased health benefit costs and the loss of collective bargaining rights forced me into bankruptcy a year ago.</p> <p>I joined Occupy Wall Street on day one.

We think corporations and wealthy individuals have too much control over our government.</p> <h2>'The impoverishment of the middle class includes those who service them', James Montgomery, New York, New York</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397603952\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349878293297/James-Montgomery-002.jpg\" alt=\"James Montgomery\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Montgomery Photograph: James Montgomery/Custom</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Montgomery/Custom</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>THEN:</strong> In 2008 I voted for Obama because I believed in health care reform and wanted the two wars to end. My verdict on Obama's first term is that it has been very mediocre. </p> <p><strong>NOW:</strong> Since 2008 I have certainly seen my disposable income fall. I am self-employed and my clients are largely individuals and small firms. With the general impoverishment of the middle class also comes the impoverishment of those who service them. I feel that Obama has looked after the huge corporations and banks, that he has been weak and vain and above all cares about how he will be seen by history. I don't know whether I can vote for him again. </p> <h2>'I'm pretty sure I'm receiving rejections from jobs before I've even submitted my application,' Ellen, Minneapolis, Minnesota</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397603953\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/11/10/1257875887351/Avatar-brown-001.jpg\" alt=\"Avatar brown\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Avatar brown Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>THEN:</strong> In 2008 I was in my second year of college, pursuing a liberal arts degree that I enjoyed but I knew wouldn't lead to immediate employment or position me ahead in the job market. I was interested in economic politics as they pertained to college students, things like student loan rates and funding for education. I'm firmly pro-choice and also an LGBTQ ally, so I wanted a candidate to reflect that. I really wanted to vote for Hillary Clinton, and did so in my State's primary, but in the end I voted for Barack Obama. </p> <p><strong>NOW:</strong> Since 2008 I have graduated from my undergraduate college and have received a master's degree from a UK university. While I am still concerned with the same issues from 2008, I am also acutely aware that the job market is not favorable. I'm pretty sure I'm receiving rejections from jobs before I've even submitted my application. I don't think Obama is as strong on economics as I would like in a candidate, but Mitt Romney's proposals are far worse. In truth, my middle class parents have had a very good turn with their jobs since Obama took office four years ago. I will be voting for Obama again this year. </p> <h2>'I have never voted, and probably never will', Sean, Boston, Massachusetts</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397603954\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/11/13/1258123322843/avatar-blue-001.jpg\" alt=\"avatar blue\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Avatar blue Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>THEN:</strong> I was let go from my job in August in 2007. I supported myself (paying rent and the MA health insurance mandate) by playing online and live poker, and collecting unemployment insurance benefits while sending out 15-20 resumes a week. I didn't vote because I live in MA, and Obama was going to win anyway. He talked tough on big banking and promised to hold the financial sector accountable.</p> <p><strong>NOW:</strong> I've had a job for 2.5 years, but it pays crap and the benefits are very poor. I still play live poker, but Obama's DOJ and the Republican Congress banned online poker from the USA, so 25%-50% my potential life earn was scrapped. Obama's Administration, littered with banking lobbyists (after saying he wouldn't do so), has given Wall Street criminals immunity.</p> <p>I don't plan to vote again because it won't change the fact I can't afford to finish college (or get a loan for it) and I can't afford to cut into the remaining debt I already have. The fact is: my situation won't change no matter who I vote for, as well as for most of my peers (minus a few ancillary details).

  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/jun/28/uselections2004.usa\">first time I met Susan Aylward</a>, in 2004, she had just emerged from the opening night of Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 in Akron, Ohio, and was shooing away John Kerry supporters who wanted to give her a sticker. She intended to vote for him and she even campaigned for him, but she had no intention of bragging about it. \"People don't love Kerry because they're not sure what he stands for,\" she said. \"But I'm going to vote for him because he's not Bush.\"</p> <p>Four years later she was positively excited at the prospect of an Obama presidency. \"I had high hopes,\" she says. \"After having to live for 8 years through Iraq and all of that stuff I really wanted Obama to be the counterpoint to that. He was a brilliant speaker. Pretty much everything about him made you hopeful. He reminded me of JFK.\"</p> <p>When we met at her house for breakfast <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/nov/01/us-elections2008-barack-obama\">just a week before the 2008 election</a> she was eager to contain her excitement. \"After the last two times I just don't want to jinx it,\" she said. \"Everything looks good. But I won't believe it until it actually happens.\" When he won she made her two-year-old granddaughter, who's mixed race, sit with her and watch the festivities. \"We kept saying: 'It's history, Sasha'. We wanted her to be able to say she saw it that day, even if she didn't really know what she was seeing.\"</p> <p>This time around she feels deflated. You can hear it in her voice as she works through her mixed emotions. It's almost as though she cast a vote for Barack Obama and got Kerry instead. \"It's not going to change my vote,\" she says. \"But I just wish he could have been better. I don't even know how exactly. If you're going to be president then I guess you obviously want to be in the history books. So what does he want to be in the history books for? I don't quite know the answer to that yet.\"</p> <p>There is a peculiar quality to the disappointment among Democrats <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2010/oct/18/gary-younge-america-obama-mania-video\">when it comes to talk of Obama's first term</a>. Most feel it but few will own it. Some project it, others deflect it. Many are in denial, some are in mourning. They struggle with it, qualify it, rationalise it, <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/167344/what-do-we-see-obama\">calibrate it and question it</a>. </p> <p>Did he raise expectations too high or were unreasonable expectations imposed upon him? Was he <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/oct/13/barack-obama-cool-to-cold\">too compliant with the Republican Congress</a> or was he trying to fulfill his promise to be more consensual? They wanted more and they're not sure whether their aspirations were reasonable, feasible, justified or deluded. They wish the disappointment wasn't there. And they can't avoid it.</p> <p>For this is one emotional toll that could have electoral consequences. In a tight race in which there are few undecideds both sides have to galvanise their bases. The Obama campaign has tried trying to manage it, lest the disappointment <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/17/barack-obama-election-gary-youngeturnout\">depress enthusiasm and harm</a>. In Charlotte <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/09/06/160713941/transcript-president-obamas-convention-speech\">Obama told the convention</a>: \"While I'm proud of what we've achieved together, I'm far more mindful of my own failings, knowing exactly what Lincoln meant when he said: \"I have been driven to my knees many times by the overwhelming conviction that I had no place else to go.\"</p> <p>Republicans are keen to leverage it, in the hope that with a show of empathy they can win over some precious waverers. Mitt Romney spoke over the heads of his convention-goers to disaffected Obama supporters: \"You know there's something wrong with the kind of job he's done as president when the best feeling you had was the day you voted for him.\" Now <a href=\"http://hotair.com/archives/2012/10/06/new-romney-ad-presses-obama-disappointment-theme/\">they are running ads</a>, mostly featuring women, to appeal to swing voters. \"I'm disappointed in Barack Obama as my president,\" says Melanie McNamara, who voted for him in 2008. \"He promised to bring us all together so we could prosper, and I don't see the prospering.\"</p> <p>Given the excitement at Obama's election some measure of disappointment was inevitable. The combination of both the historic nature of both his candidacy and the economic crisis during which it emerged virtually ensured it. The first black president elected during the steepest downturn since the Great Depression <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/nov/24/barack-obama-nic-hillary-clinton\">set the nation on contradictory paths</a>. In Harlem people were dancing in the street even as, at the other end of Manhattan, Wall Street was sending the economy into free fall. The month he was elected \u2013 two months before he took office \u2013 he had a 61% approval rating while only one in six believed the country was heading in the right direction, and it was unlikely one person could correct the course of a tanker the size of the US economy.</p> <h2>'I never thought things could become more divided'</h2> <p>After <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/believers-great-men-think-alike \">rereading The God That Failed</a>, in which six ex-Marxists voice their disaffection with communism, the late Palestinian intellectual Edward Said questioned the very premise in the title. \"Why as an intellectual did you believe in a god anyway? And besides, who gave you the right to imagine that your early belief and later disenchantment were so important?\" One might say the same of some Obama supporters whose investment in him was rooted in an unreasonable belief that the presidency endowed Obama with superhuman powers. \"This is not some academic exercise,\" Obama told supporters in Philadelphia in 2010. \"Don't compare us to the Almighty; compare us to the alternative.\"</p> <p>That's why Susan believes people must, to some extent, take responsibility for their disappointment. \"That's what we're taught to believe from an early age,\" she says. \"That one man should be able to fix everything. Abe Lincoln, George Washington, Ronald Reagan \u2013 history's told as though it were all down to them. The world is way too complex for that, and we know that but we still have those expectations that we were raised with.\"</p> <p>And while some of the expectations may have been unreasonable some were just plain unfounded. On election night in 2008 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/nov/06/uselections2008-usa\">I watched the result come in</a> the President's Lounge on the South Side of Chicago. As Obama was announced the winner a woman at the bar started cheering. \"My man's in Afghanistan. He's coming home.\" Quite why she thought that wasn't clear. But it wasn't true. Afghanistan was the one war Obama had pledged to continue and which he would eventually escalate. Where she'd got the impression otherwise is not clear. But her disappointment was guaranteed and had little to do with him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397516241\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349879439048/obama-younge-america-010.jpg\" alt=\"obama younge america\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of Obama's first acts in January 2009 was to sign an executive order closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay.

Photograph: J Scott Applewhite/AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: J Scott Applewhite/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Indeed one of the sources of disappointment, particularly from abroad, is that people mistook the fact that his election marked a radical departure from the previous eight years as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/jan/17/barack-obama-one-year-on\">an indication that he was a radical</a>. He wasn't. His record both as a state senator and on the national level, where he voted with Hilary Clinton 90% of the time, was of a centrist Democrat. Unlike black presidential candidates of the past, who were unlikely to get white support, he was not standing to advance a broader cause <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/obama-effect\">but to get elected</a>. \"The civil rights generation saw politics as the next step in the struggle for civil rights,\" said Salim Muwakkil, a Chicago-based journalist who has known Obama for many years. \"Their aim was to get their agenda taken up by whoever won. But this new generation do not conceive politics as the next step, but just as what it is \u2013 politics. Their aim is to win.\"</p> <p>But the fact that he didn't stand on a radical platform doesn't mean people were deluded to imagine that he would govern as a radical. In January 2007 I <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/feb/10/usa.uselections2008\">saw him speak at George Mason University</a> to a 1,000-plus crowd where he quoted Martin Luther King: \"The arc of justice is long but bends towards justice.\" He promised his presidency would be transformative and in campaign speeches he invoked abolitionists, suffragettes and labour activists and then Will.I.Am <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjXyqcx-mYY\">set it to song</a>. \"Nothing can stand in the way of the power of millions of voices calling for change,\" he said. \"We have been asked to pause for a reality check. We have been warned against offering people of this nation false hope.\" One could be forgiven for thinking he wasn't just talking about marginal tax rates and cap and trade.</p> <p>Such were the nature of the aspirations and potential disappointments, both projected onto him and which he projected himself, before he even took office. Then <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/jan/19/obama-inauguration\">there is his record</a>. Pretty much everybody has their pet disappointment here: a specific thing they'd wanted to see but haven't or, conversely, wished he hadn't done. Most frequently mentioned are failing to close Guantanamo Bay, political polarisation, drone attacks, comprehensive immigration reform, kill lists and<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jul/15/democrats-romney-firing-obama\"> failing to oversee stronger regulation of the financial sector</a>. It is intriguing how many Obama loyalists explain these problems away with a mixture of psychoanalysis and Donald Rumsfeld's \"unknown unknowns\". </p> <p>\"I know he's smart. I know he's caring,\" says Bobbi Watson, who was with Susan the night I met her outside the cinema eight years ago. \"But when I think about the drone attacks, which trouble me, I think he's making decisions on the basis of information that I couldn't possibly know.\"</p> <p>Many redirect their disappointment in politics in general,<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/mar/27/obama-no-credible-republican-challenger\"> pointing to the Republican stonewalling in Congress</a>. \"I never thought things could become more divided, and there be more fighting,\" said Ann Trinkel, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/01/younge-america-return-roanoke\">who I met in Roanoke recently</a>. \"But oh my gosh it's just \u2026 gridlock. And I guess that's what sort of lessened the hopefulness for me, and made me a bit more cynical, is all the money.\" It is certainly true that in a system where seats are openly gerrymandered, 40% in the upper house can block almost anything, lobbyists are everywhere and you need vast sums of money to get elected there is a limit to how much <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/07/americans-deserve-better-choice-election\">progressive change one can really expect</a>. Susan's husband, Michael who backed Obama last time, isn't voting. He's had enough of all of them.</p> <p>Some are just in denial. One person said to me when I raised the escalation in Afghanistan: \"You don't know what's in his heart.\"</p> <p>\"True,\" I replied. \"Only his cardiologist can know that. But that knowledge would make little difference to the people of Afghanistan.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397516242\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349879038034/obama-younge-america--010.jpg\" alt=\"obama younge america \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The enthusiasm of Obama supporters \u2013 so prevalent on election night in 2008 \u2013 has waned in the last four years.

In any case, every president has these. So long as they are not full on reversals \u2013 as when George Bush senior said: \"Read my lips: no new taxes\" and then put up taxes \u2013 then they are rarely fatal. Obama hasn't opened another Guantanamo Bay facility, and it is understood that presidents don't get everything done that they promise to do.</p> <p>But that does not mean they are not grounds for disappointment. Obama ran claiming he was going to change the way Washington operated, and there was much he could not control. But it was his choice to leave in place George W Bush's secretary of defence and to draft of Bill Clinton's former treasury secretary, Larry Summers, to guide his economic policy. With those appointments there's only so much 'change' one can reasonably expect. Moreover, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/guantanamo-bay-open-promises/story?id=16698768\">if someone who says</a>: \"I have said repeatedly that I intend to close Guantanamo, and I will follow through on that,\" and promises it'll be closed within a year and it's still open, then by any measure people are entitled to feel let down.</p> <p>But left there all of these particular disappointments would have remained just that \u2013 particular letdowns that disillusioned discrete groups of people. What morphed them into a broader narrative of disappointment was the one thing over was the key issue of the economy over which he had limited power \u2013 and gridlock in Congress.</p> <p>In September 2010 he was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBfCco9BOTA\">challenged at a town hall meeting</a> by a black woman, Velma Hart, who said: \"I'm exhausted. I'm exhausted of defending you, defending your administration, defending the mantle of change that I voted for, and deeply disappointed with where we are right now.\"</p> <p>With poverty rising, unemployment stubbornly high and wages still stagnant the economy was both a material problem in itself \u2013 people have been struggling to make ends meet \u2013 and became an emblem for a broader disaffection. The country was stalled. And whatever it was they were expecting from his presidency it wasn't this. They wanted more and, many believe, he promised more.</p> <h2>'It seems like there's no good way out'</h2> <p>Jodie Delamatre has no time for this. She is no stranger to disappointment. I <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/nov/03/uselections2004.usa2\">followed Jodie around on election day in 2004</a> as she knocked on doors to get out the vote. I saw her in the polling booth press her pin down hard to avoid through the punch card for Kerry to avoid any Florida-like shenanigans. \"I've got to make sure it counts,\" she said. \"I don't want to leave anything to chance.\" That night when the polls closed they thought they'd squeaked a victory in Ohio and therefore the nation. When I called her the next morning she was devastated.</p> <p>This time around she wished Obama had done more about the banks. But she thinks those who dwell on their disappointments are self-indulgent. \"People <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/nov/10/barack-obama-supporters-campaign\">ask what has he done and I think well what did you do</a>? You can't just have things given to you all the time. You have to go out and get them. And look at the things he has done. In four years he's introduced healthcare reform, stabilised the economy, stopped a war, killed Bin Laden, saved the auto industry \u2013 give me a break.\" When Obama was inaugurated <a href=\"http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=z1ebjpgk2654c1_&amp;met_y=unemployment_rate&amp;idim=county:CN391530&amp;fdim_y=seasonality:U&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=summit+county+oh+unemployment\">unemployment in Summit County</a>, where Akron sits, was 8.8%; today it is 6.5%. In 2009 the poverty rate is 14.9; today it is 13.8%.</p> <p>It is true that if you ask most people what they thought would happen their hopes are as heartfelt as they are vague. \"I definitely think it's about me,\" says Susan. \"I hoped he would give us a vision of where we were going. Just one big idea. But it doesn't seem as though he has one. I did hope that he would be that person who would pull it off. Because otherwise it seems like there's no good way out.\"</p> <p>Obama's election forced a reckoning between what a large number of Americans wanted to happen and what was possible to achieve through the American polity as it stands. The hard truth is that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/oct/24/obama-never-room-for-radical-change\">with few exceptions</a> the most transformational advances in US political history have their origins either in the streets or the courts \u2013 not the ballot box.</p>",
  "<p>Wednesday morning in New York: outside it is drab and drizzly. Inside the Good Morning America studios at ABC it is brighter than ever \u2013 Ann Romney is here! And not just for a quick interview, but to host the show! Well not the <em>whole</em> show, we are told at 7am \u2013&#xa0;but she would be \"coming in in our second hour!\"</p> <p>GMA is on a roll at the moment, beating NBC's the Today Show on a regular ratings basis. Ann Romney is on a roll, too, as one of the more popular faces of her husband's campaign. Her poll numbers currently outdo her husband's by nine points. Like all political spouses on the campaign trail, her duties fall into the intellectually light, but warm and fuzzy category. This means that GMA and Ann Romney are a perfect match.</p> <p>At 7.30am, we were told that among other things Romney would be doing was \"sharing a family recipe.\" The Romney family is particularly partial to Welsh cakes \u2013 or \"a kind of English scone\".</p> <p>There's something of the Martha Stewart about Ann Romney's tall, strong, slightly intimidating presence. Both seem to stride through the oversized, well-equipped kitchens of life taking their blows firmly on their unflinching, upraised chins. \"Tough\" is a word you could use to describe them both. Also, \"middle-class\" and \"white\". So baking seemed a reasonable morning gig for Ann Romney to undertake on national television.</p> <p>\"After raising five boys, I'm ready for anything!\" cried an enthusiastic Romney, catching a football and wearing a hot pink jacket as the camera announced her presence at 8am. But the best thing about live television is you can't always follow a script.</p> <p>\"They're burning,\" she muttered through clenched teeth to an unseen minion, seconds later, not realizing she was on camera. \"You can turn the griddle down.\"</p> <p>That was the first and last we saw of the Welsh cakes.<br> Instead her first segment is a forgettable interview with the losers of last night's Dancing With the Stars. DWTS is not having a good season on ABC, so if the wife of a residential candidate can help get the show some viewers \u2013 great. I'm not sure Romney sitting formally in her signature red shirt-dress asking singer Drew Lachey: \"How did you like your scoring on the cha-cha?\" will really bring it home. But she tried. Romney might be very wealthy, but she's also a wife and a mother with health issues. Which means she falls nicely into the GMA demographic. The show tailored itself around those similarities creating a segment where she petted the horse Lord Ludger while its rider, Becca Hart, who had competed in the London Paralympics, was briefly interviewed.</p> <p>\"It's so extraordinary what horses do for us. For me, it's balance, it's love, it's joy,\" said Romney, who has famously used equine therapy to help deal with multiple sclerosis. \"Horses are a gift from God and they are a partner in our life's journey and they can bring such joy.\" </p> <p>(Brief pause while I pictured Jason Sudeikis playing Mitt Romney as a horse on this week's Saturday Night Live.)<br> Finally, with only 10 minutes of the show left, she began cooking. Well, actually, she watched as Stanley Tucci, who is promoting a new cookbook, began cooking. \"I think our butter is burning, sorry,\" said Tucci in a relaxed manner, taking a saucepan off the heat.</p> <p>\"They burnt my Welsh cakes, too,\" said Romney, throwing up her hands.</p> <p>\"This show's a disaster,\" said Tucci.</p> <p>\"Yeah,\" said Romney.</p> <p>\"This is really burning!\" said Tucci as sparks started flying off the butter.</p> <p>\"Every time I don't know,\" said Romney, laughing. \"My plane almost goes down \u2013 now I'm going to catch on fire.\"</p> <p>But she never did \u2013 in any sense of the word.</p>",
  "<p>In the hours that followed the surreal role reversal in last week's presidential debate, liberal political scientists and statisticians rushed to the public square to insist that television scraps of the like rarely reorganize contests. Breathless and harried the lot of them, these number-crunchers&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/10/03/what-political-scientists-know-about-debates/\">swore the fundamentals of the race would remain</a>: President Barack Obama would preserve his lead in spite of challenger Mitt Romney's silver-tongued swipes.</p> <p>But the sobering truth is that debates are something more than shallow theater and can dramatically shape candidate perceptions. A spate of new surveys out this week found voter preferences have swung wildly in the days since Romney scored his debate upset, with the Republican jumping into the lead in&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/us/general_election_romney_vs_obama-1171.html\">Real Clear Politics' polling index</a>&#xa0;for the first time in the race.</p> <p>Gallup found 72% of debate watchers thought Romney won, a full 52-point spread between the challenger and incumbent.&#xa0;That's the <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/157907/romney-narrows-vote-gap-historic-debate-win.aspx\">single largest debate deficit ever recorded by the polling firm</a>, the previously largest margin won by Bill Clinton in George HW Bush's infamous \"wristwatch-checking\" performance.</p> <p>Pew likewise <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/files/legacy-pdf/10-8-12%20Political%20Release.pdf\">tracked a draw among registered voters</a>, though Romney had managed to build a 4-point lead over Obama when the sample was limited only to those respondents likely to vote in the November contest. Rasmussen's latest daily tracking also measured support evenly split between the two men, at 48%, down from a modest upswing for the president.</p> <p>But the state of play across the map is similarly promising for Republicans. Surveys of seven of the nine battleground states have been released in the period since last week's debate. In five of those seven, Romney leads the president and trails only within the margin of error in the remaining two. That's a distinctly winnable race.&#xa0;</p> <p>The salience of contemporary presidential debates is largely a function of a hyperactive media environment that elevates to parallel significance a fumbled joke with a fumbled economy or a declaration of war. The daily grind \u2013 the painful minutiae of a horse race in which reporters and aides obsess over minor stump missteps \u2013 don't drive the sentiment of ordinary voters. Stumbles of the pedestrian variety, like <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/08/mitt-romneys-birth-certificate-joke/261553/\">Romney's recent&#xa0;birth certificate jest</a>&#xa0;or <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRV5Y1JCGRI\">Joe Biden's largely forgotten&#xa0;invitation to a wheel chair-bound man to stand</a>, don't inform voter views.</p> <p>Instead, it's the big moments: the historic wins and losses, the inability of an incumbent president to make a serious case for re-election. For Romney, who has been trailing the president in polling for much of the race, the implication of a debate-wrought surge cannot be overstated.</p> <p>The candidate who led in the national polling aggregate after the first debate has won the White House in every race since Jimmy Carter booted Gerald Ford. This same axiom later displaced the <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0913958/\">Man from Plains</a> just four years later, even as he trailed Ronald Reagan by a modest one point in post-debate polling.</p> <p>For this operative, who <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/01/what-was-the-huntsman-campaigns-problem/251469/\">labored for much of the last 18 months</a>&#xa0;to ensure Romney never clinched the nomination, it was a bitter-sweet moment to watch as the Bay Stater lanced the president. I spent many a primary debate night working into the early morning hours, shuffling embarrassing Romney exchanges and news clips to anyone willing to hear the spin.</p> <p>It was of no consequence that my candidate, Jon Huntsman, didn't win, ever. What did matter was that Romney didn't.</p> <p>But last week was different. It was historic, and the polls overwhelmingly reflect it.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Disclosure notice: the principal of the author's firm, <a href=\"http://www.hynescommunications.com/about-us/\">Hynes Communications</a>, serves as an adviser to the Romney campaign, though he has no formal connection to the GOP effort</em><br></p>",

The island's governor, Raffaele Lombardo, resigned in the midst of a mafia inquiry and a growing scandal over the exaggerated wages of local politicians. \"We have come to wipe out the political class in Sicily,\" Grillo said.</p> <p>Voters fed up with corruption have already heeded the comedian's call to clean up politics by electing a Five Star candidate as mayor of Parma in May. Polls suggest the movement will secure seats in parliament at national elections next year.</p> <p>As Grillo left the shores of Calabria the town council of Reggio Calabria was being dissolved after investigators discovered family ties between councillors and mobsters. Further north, a Milan council assessor was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly paying \u20ac200,000 to the Ndrangheta mafia to buy 4,000 votes in local elections.</p> <p>Grillo said Giuseppe Garibaldi began his march to Rome after he landed in Sicily in 1860, leading to unification of the country under the Savoy monarchy, and allied armies landed on the island in 1943 before ejecting the Nazis from Italy. \"Garibaldi brought the Savoys, the Americans brought the mafia, and none of them actually swam here,\" he said.</p> <p>Grillo's supporters have recently disputed what they describe as a lack of democracy within his fledgling party, and some have criticised the role of Gianroberto Casaleggio, a shadowy adviser seen as making key decisions in the movement.</p> <p>But the recent resignation of the scandal-hit governor of the Lazio region \u2013 elected on the ticket of the former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi \u2013 has given a fresh boost to Grillo's movement, pushing it up to 14% in the polls in Lazio, ahead of Berlusconi's 13%.</p> <p>Berlusconi, who tried for a decade to build a bridge across the strait of Messina, chose to relaunch his political fortunes last month by boarding a Mediterranean cruise ship packed with supporters. After his ratings drooped following the Lazio scandal, he announced this week he was unlikely to stand again.</p> <p>Grillo said he would now tour Sicily by camper van, jogging in front of it when entering towns. \"I will be like the pied piper,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>He's been called \"<a href=\"http://www.americanprogress.org/about/staff/romm-joseph/bio/\">America's fiercest climate blogger</a>.\" And as a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a former Clinton administration official on clean energy, and an MIT trained physicist, the subjects he covers are vast\u2014ranging from energy policy to the role of rhetoric in communications, as discussed in his new book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1477452222?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=poinofinqu-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=1477452222\"><em>Language Intelligence</em></a>. But there's been a <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2011/09/08/314629/polling-obama-climate-change-public-opinion/\">recurrent theme</a> over the years at Joe Romm's popular blog <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/issue/\">Climate Progress</a>\u2014the argument that political leaders, and perhaps most prominently President Obama, need to step up and explain to the public why global warming is such a dramatic threat to our livelihoods and future.</p> <p>Indeed, Romm has called Obama's failure to speak out about global warming, loudly and often, his \"<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joseph-romm/obamas-other-climate-mess_b_1884150.html\">biggest communications mistake</a>.\"</p> <p>Now, a <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2012/10/swing-voters-climate-change-issue\">raft of new polls</a> are showing that this issue has the potential to move independent and swing voters\u2014the subject of our <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2012/10/event-climate-changes-sleeper-role-election-2012\">first Climate Desk Live Capitol Hill briefing on October 10</a>. So we stopped to chat with Romm, who will present at the briefing, about his unique take on this subject.</p> <p><strong>Chris Mooney:</strong> You've been writing for a long time about how climate is a winning political issue. So what first got you onto this?</p> <p><strong>Joe Romm:</strong> Well, I didn't pursue this topic because I thought it was a political winner. I started when my brother lost his home in Katrina, he wanted to know if he should rebuild, so I talked to a lot of climate scientists. And then I realized, \"this is more dire than I thought, and climate scientists are not doing a good job of communicating it.\" So it was the underlying reality that gave me an urgency to stop doing what I was doing\u2014clean energy consulting\u2014and start doing communications full time.</p> <p>I have talked to the leading social scientists over the years. If you talk to <a href=\"http://comm.stanford.edu/faculty/krosnick/\">Jon Krosnick</a> or <a href=\"http://www.climatechangecommunication.org/edward_maibach.cfm\">Ed Maibach</a> or <a href=\"http://www.pages.drexel.edu/%7Ebrullerj/\">Robert Brulle</a>, they will tell you that this is an issue that the public broadly gets\u2013and that there is an <a href=\"http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind12/c7/c7h.htm#s3\">underlying respect for science and scientists</a>. And so there is a way to talk about this issue that does work politically.</p> <p>That said, there are ways to talk about it that aren't useful, and I think people have mistaken the blowback from bad communications for thinking there's no way to communicate on this issue. And I think that's just not right.</p> <p><strong>CM:</strong> Do you think this has always been true\u2014that climate change has always been a potential political winner\u2013or has it become more true over time?</p> <p><strong>JR:</strong> I think many climate scientists have gotten better at communications because of Climategate. I think many of them thought they were like medical scientists\u2013you make your pronouncement, and then the patient does what he's told to do. And they realized that that's not how the political system works. You have to understand how to be an effective communicator.</p> <p>Since I had talked to all of these climate scientists and read the literature, I knew that climate change was coming faster than a lot of people thought. I knew it was going to be coming at this accelerated rate. So things are changing in real time, and now we've reached the point where the signal is distinguished from the noise.</p> <p>It was always the case that extreme weather was going to be the way that most people were going to experience climate change directly\u2014that seemed clear to me from all my research. Extreme weather is very random, but it is on top of a climate signal that continues to grow. So over time, you get more and more extreme events that are way above the natural variation.</p> <p>And so yes, I think we are now seeing events that are once in a thousand year events, like the Russian heat wave. I mean, Binghamton, New York had a one in one hundred year rain event in two consecutive years! And so that's led people like Jeff Masters to say, this is not the atmosphere I grew up with.</p> <p><strong>CM:</strong> If all of this is true, then where is the blockage between all the polling data on the one hand, and the behavior of political candidates on the other?</p> <p><strong>JR:</strong> There's no question that the Obama team has gotten a misimpression that this is not a winning issue. And that I think is based on some rather questionable analysis done years ago, that basically said, \"if you only present the doom and gloom case, you turn some people off.\" But nobody really does that\u2014nobody I know does that.</p> <p><strong>CM:</strong> Do we see any candidates who get the message and are campaigning on climate?</p> <p><strong>JR:</strong> I <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/10/04/944151/avoiding-obamas-mistake-senate-candidates-slam-gop-opponents-over-climate-denial/\">just published an article</a> which showed that at least some Senate candidates, including Angus King, Elizabeth Warren, and Bob Kerrey, have raised this as an issue. And after the 2010 election, I noted there were only two Senate campaigns in which it became an issue. And in both of those, the anti-science candidate got blowback\u2013Carly Fiorina in California and Ken Buck in Colorado. And they lost.</p> <p>The polling data seems clear: This is a classic wedge issue that separates conservatives not just from progressives, but also from moderates and independents. So you know, we can spend a lot of time being puzzled about why this administration does bizarre messaging. If you talk to communications experts, many will say this administration is not great at it. You can get upset about President Obama not bringing up climate change, but this is not an administration that's good at communicating\u2013and this is just one of the many areas that they mistakenly downplay.</p> <p><strong>CM:</strong> As someone who does study communication closely, how would you recommend politicians talk about this issue?</p> <p><strong>JR:</strong> It depends on the audience, certainly. As someone who studies communication, I know that the most important thing is knowing who your audience is. And people who read my blog are not the general public.</p> <p>But, I've always believed that you should stick as closely to the science as possible. And my biggest advice to reporters has been, if you're doing a climate story, talk to climate scientists. The best climate stories are done by the people who talk to climate scientists. But I think this notion that you shouldn't talk about the science, or how dire things might be if we don't' act, that's silly.</p> <p>And on moral grounds, I think that if you believe a certain outcome is a very possible outcome, you have an obligation to tell people that. With global warming, the probability of a bad outcome if we stay on our current emission trends is incredibly high. If you know a bad outcome is likely to happen, what right do you have not to communicate that? You go into a doctor's office, what are they going to do\u2013not tell you the diagnosis?</p> <p>\u2022 You can hear more from Joe Romm at the 10 October Climate Desk Live event, entitled \"<a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2012/10/event-climate-changes-sleeper-role-election-2012\">Climate Change's Sleeper Role in Election 2012</a>.\" This article was first published by the Guardian's partner, <a href=\"http://climatedesk.org/2012/10/why-arent-politicians-listening-to-this-guy-on-climate/\">Climate Desk</a></p>",
  "<p>The Israeli former prime minister Ehud Olmert is considering a political comeback, despite his recent conviction for breach of trust and his forthcoming trial on bribery charges, to challenge Binyamin Netanyahu in a general election next year.</p> <p>Olmert, who was prime minister from 2006 until 2009, is expected to decide on the move within days, according to media reports. His allies claim there is no legal bar to such a move.</p> <p>Netanyahu announced on Tuesday evening that he would go to the polls early next year rather than face the defeat of his austerity budget. The date is to be set in the coming days, with most commentators predicting late January or early February.</p> <p>Olmert could return to lead the centre-right Kadima party, ousting its present head, Shaul Mofaz. Other possibilities are that Olmert leads a new centre party or heads up a bloc of centre parties, which may be able to muster enough seats to dislodge Netanyahu. Olmert is considered to be the only figure capable of mounting a credible challenge to the incumbent PM.</p> <p>\"What is driving Netanyahu to the polling stations at almost hysterical speed is Ehud Olmert. Bibi also reads the polls \u2026 and he knows that the only one who can give him a real fight, as an equal, with an actual chance, is Olmert,\" wrote the columnist Ben Caspit in the Ma'ariv newspaper. Netanyahu's move was intended \"to pre-empt Olmert's comeback, catch his opponents off guard and steal a new term before it's too late\", he said.</p> <p>The former Kadima minister Haim Ramon confirmed that he had approached Olmert about joining a new centre party. \"I am talking to Ehud Olmert, he has obviously not made his decisions and we need to wait patiently and if you want to find out from him you need to talk to him, but in principle we are talking,\" Ramon told Army Radio.</p> <p>Kadima, which emerged from the last election as the biggest party but was unable to form a government, is projected to win only eight seats in the 120-place parliament, down from 28 in 2009.</p> <p>Amit Segal, chief political correspondent for Israel's Channel 2, said: \"Kadima is in such a desperate position that Mofaz would be happy to give up his place to Olmert.\" However, he added, Olmert's public appeal was tempered by his criminal cases and the fact that he took Israel into two wars, in 2006 and 2008.</p> <p>Last month Olmert was fined and given a suspended prison sentence after being convicted of breach of trust when a minister. He was cleared of corruption charges. He still faces another trial on bribery charges over a residential development called Holyland. He has denied the accusations and his lawyers say the case against him is weak.</p> <p>As prime minister, Olmert was responsible for the second Lebanon war in the summer of 2006, and the three-week conflict in Gaza that began on 27 December 2008. He entered into secret and detailed negotiations with the Palestinians on a settlement to end the conflict, which reached an advanced stage before he was forced to resign as party leader over corruption charges.</p>",
  "<p>Tuesday was yet another wild day in the world of polling. The immediate picture is that it was mostly good news for Team Romney, though a <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/09/cnn-poll-race-tightening-up-in-battleground-ohio/\">CNN/ORC poll</a> from Ohio gives Obama an edge. Let's drill down some of the important points in the latest data and about where the race stands.</p> <p><strong>1). Romney is ahead in the national polls</strong></p> <p>For the first time since 2011, Romney leads in the <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/us/general_election_romney_vs_obama-1171.html\">Real Clear Politics average</a>. His lead is a little under a single point, yet this may actually be underestimating Romney's edge. The Real Clear average does not include either the <a href=\"http://americanresearchgroup.com/pres2012/NA12.html\">American Research Group</a> poll that has Romney up a point or the <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/weeklypolling/2012/10/4\">Public Policy Polling</a> survey that has Romney ahead by 2 points. Indeed, there hasn't been a single national poll conducted post-debate among likely voters that has Romney trailing.</p> <p>There had been a <a href=\"http://prospect.org/article/romneys-47-percent-ceiling\">lot of chatter</a> that Romney was unable to put together a coalition to help him attain a plurality of the vote. He has now shown he can do it. Moreover, Romney's lead marks an importance difference between this campaign and 2004, a year noted for its <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/04/2012-election-is-bush-kerry-in-reverse.html\">remarkable similarities</a> to 2012. John Kerry never led in the <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2004/president/us/general_election_bush_vs_kerry-939.html\">October polling average</a> in 2004. It's a good time for Romney to catch fire, if it holds.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>2). The switch to likely voters among pollsters continues to help Mitt Romney</strong></p> <p>Let's face it: Democrats have an <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/07/chuck-todd-republican-voters_n_1946586.html\">enthusiasm problem</a>. Yes, every vote counts the same as the next, but only if it's cast. Pollsters across the board continue to find Mitt Romney supporters are more likely to vote than President Obama's. The latest two installments are <a href=\"http://news.investors.com/special-report/508415-ibdtipp-poll.aspx\">IBD/TIPP</a> and, more importantly, <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/157955/romney-obama-among-likely-voters.aspx\">Gallup</a>.</p> <p>Gallup produced a 3-point Obama advantage among registered voters in its seven-day tracker, but most of the blogosphere was taken up with Mitt Romney leading by 2 points among <em>likely</em> voters \u2013 a 5-point gap. That's a large difference, but it isn't unprecedented. Gallup's final <a href=\"http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/polls/usatodaypolls.htm\">2004 poll</a> produced a 4-point difference between John Kerry and George W Bush, with Bush taking likely voters by 2 points. The likely voter poll was correct in this instance.</p> <p>My blogging buddy Nate Cohn <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/blog/electionate/108342/romneys-gain-among-likely-voters-not-unusual\">points out</a> that Gallup initially had a wide likely and registered voter gap in 2008, which shrank during the course of October. 2004 showed no such shrinkage; in fact, the gap got wider. Still, the two results indicate that the likely and registered voter gap is not necessarily stable.</p> <p><strong>3). Romney's losing momentum \u2013 or perhaps he isn't</strong></p> <p>Another Gallup headline was that their registered voter results in the last two days, an Obama 5-point lead, matched their survey <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/157955/romney-obama-among-likely-voters.aspx\">just prior to the debate</a>. Obama also added 2 points to the three-day Gallup approval rating among adults. He now stands at 53% approval among this population. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/08/romney-debate-bounce-real-but-fading\">As I pointed out Monday</a>, it's not the only data to indicate that Romney's debate bump may be stalling.</p> <p>There is, however, data suggesting Romney's decline could just be a statistical anomaly. <a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/obama_administration/daily_presidential_tracking_poll\">Rasmussen shows</a> a tie, as it did Monday, and Obama's approval rating actually dropped a point there. The <a href=\"http://ipsos-na.com/news-polls/pressrelease.aspx?id=5815\">Reuters/Ipsos</a> tracking poll has Obama falling to his lowest level since the Democratic convention.</p> <p>Also \u2013 and, admittedly, this is somewhat confusing \u2013 Obama's Sunday Gallup data was better than the previous Sunday, but this Monday was worse for him than last Monday. That suggests Obama may have had a monster Sunday that pushed up his two-day Sunday/Monday average against Romney, yet it shouldn't be mistaken for a greater trend. We need at least a few more days of data to know for sure if this was merely a Romney blip or a surge with more long-lasting impact.</p> <p><strong>4). The blue state \"wall\" seemingly holds, but \u2026</strong></p> <p>Had CNN/ORC produced a Romney lead in the swing state of Ohio, it would have marked the crumbling of an Obama firewall that has been secure this entire election. Instead, Obama has stayed ahead by 4 points, 51% to 47%, in the survey. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/oh/ohio_romney_vs_obama-1860.html\">average lead</a> for Obama in five post-debate Ohio polls stands at about a point. A number of those surveys are from firms that don't call cellphones or have a less than stellar reputation. The reliable <a href=\"http://battlegroundwatch.com/2012/10/09/obama-1-in-ohio-surveyusanbc4/\">SurveyUSA does</a>, however, show Obama only ahead by a single point. So we shouldn't take CNN's numbers and run to the bank with them.</p> <p>There are additional signs that Romney is catching up to Obama in other states in which the president had led. <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/polls/siena-15617\">Siena College</a> found Obama's lead down to 3 points in Pennsylvania \u2013 a much tighter margin than previous polls had found in the state. <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/polls/epic-mra-15605\">EPIC-MRA</a> shows Romney rising \u2013 though, importantly, Obama not falling \u2013 to only 3 points behind Obama in Michigan. Nevada also seems to be getting tighter: <a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2012/election_2012_presidential_election/nevada/election_2012_nevada_president\">Rasmussen</a>, who has actually shown better numbers for Obama recently than many other surveys, found a tie in Nevada.</p> <p>I should note (as I have said before): <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/03/national-polls-swing-state-election\">states tend to follow the national trend</a>. That trend has Romney pulling ahead nationally. It would be difficult for Obama to win the electoral college, if he loses the popular vote by a point or more.</p> <p><strong>5). Don't lose your head</strong></p> <p>I may feed the addiction, but don't take any one poll result too seriously. You can look at the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/pollster/\">Huffington Post Pollster aggregate</a> or even our <a href=\"http://www.ismittromneythepresident.com/\">balloon average</a> (a visual representation of the Real Clear Politics data). There are still plenty of days and data left. You'll make yourself a nervous wreck if you treat each poll result as either victory virtually within grasp or the end of the world.</p> <p><strong>Conclusion: the election, if held today, is too close to call</strong></p> <p>You don't need a fancy formula to look at the data and see the race is within a point either way. It's quite possible that Obama will open up a lead again in the coming days. It's also possible that he won't. All I can say for certain right now is this race is exciting.</p>",
  "<p>Lena Dunham's hit TV show, Girls, reaches UK screens on 22 October. Dunham has reportedly been offered a $3.5m book deal by Random House, and the hype surrounding the show, and her writing is particular, is borderline hysterical.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/08/girls-twitter-feminism-caitlin-moran?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter\" title=\"\">criticism</a> and <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/emma-gray/10-reasons-wont-participate-lena-dunham-backlash_b_1940873.html\" title=\"\">praise</a> of Dunham's depiction of four young women living in New York is seemingly as polarised and as passionate as the US presidential election and while it may all seem a bit ridiculous, looking at the current state of female-focused television, it's not that hard to see why. The shows on TV \"for women\" at the moment are hardly hitting a sociological nerve with their fresh, female narrative. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Girl_%28TV_series%29\" title=\"\">Zooey Deschanel's New Girl</a> doesn't exactly make women want to high-five their television sets in appreciation of its social commentary or feminist agenda, and the majority of female characters currently on TV are rather problematic.</p> <p>The expectation is that Girls will become the Ultimate Show For Women, or as Dunham's character Hannah says, become the voice of her generation (she later gingerly adds \"Or a voice. Of a generation\").</p> <p>Looking back at the female-focused TV shows that have broken barriers, glass ceilings and forever changed the way women have been portrayed on TV \u2013 Girls has some big boots to fill (or Manolos.

A little dark and a little twisted, Daria was the antithesis of the popular, blond cheerleader that sitcoms of this time were so found of, giving girls who would rather read Edgar Allen Poe than Seventeen magazine the perfect role model.</p> <h2><strong>My So-Called Life</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zpVRdUaSQP8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zpVRdUaSQP8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>What 15-year-old girl didn't relate to Angela Chase? <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108872/\" title=\"\">My So-Called Life</a> sadl only lasted one series, but in only 19 episodes managed to treat issues like homophobia, drug abuse, and censorship as regular themes, rather than just giving them a \"special episode\" like most teen-focused shows of the 1990s did. Angela, expertly portrayed by a young Clare Danes, served as one of the most uncensored views as to what it was really like to be a teenage girl on TV, resulting in a cult-like following of the show, even in 2012.</p> <h2><strong>Murphy Brown</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JDtCemClRP8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JDtCemClRP8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy_Brown\" title=\"\">Murphy Brown</a>, played by Candice Bergin, was a famous investigative journalist and news anchor. She was in her 40s, she was single, and controversially, when Brown became pregnant and her ex-husband decided he couldn't handle the responsibility of being a parent, Murphy decided to raise her son on her own as a single mother. Famously, the then US vice president Dan Quayle criticised Murphy Brown for \"ignoring the importance of fathers by birthing a child alone\" in a public speech. Murphy Brown was a trailblazer in a time where single mothers and working women were both criticised and misunderstood, both on the silver screen, and off.</p> <h2><strong>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-1v_q6TWAL4?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-1v_q6TWAL4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Written and created by the delightfully feminist Joss Whedon, Buffy served as vampire slaying role model for geek girls everywhere. Balancing the demands of schoolwork, friendships, family drama, boyfriends (that happened to be vampires) and saving the world from a hellmouth, Buffy Summers was remarkably relatable. Buffy was show of pure female empowerment, thanks to Willow's lesbian relationship with Tara, a slew of female baddies and slayers, and not to mention Buffy's steadfast determination and general bad-assness.</p> <h2><strong>Sex and the City</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GVchsrlP59I?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GVchsrlP59I\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>While the recent Sex and the City films have turned the brand into some sort of caricature of itself, Sex and the City the television series a phenomenon. For women of many ages, watching Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon, Kim Cattrall and Kristin Davis navigate through their 30s and 40s in New York City was a fascinating, sentimental and emotional experience for many women. No other female characters on TV had or spoke of sex the way these women did. Sex and the City may have introduced the cupcake epidemic to the masses, but it also was a huge milestone for how women were portrayed on TV.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama's supporters are three times more likely to have read Jonathan Franzen's novels than Mitt Romney's followers, according to analysis from Goodreads.</p> <p>The popular book recommendation website, which says it has 11 million members, polled readers to find out which way they would be voting in the imminent US elections, and then <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/blog/show/388-you-are-what-you-read-reading-habits-of-voters\">analysed the books that respondents had placed on their virtual shelves</a>.</p> <p>Of those who responded, Romney supporters were two times more likely to have read David McCullough, the heavyweight historian known for his biographies of US presidents Harry Truman and John Adams, and four times more likely to have read <a href=\"http://heavenisforreal.net/\">Heaven is for Real</a>, \"the true story of the four-year old son of a small town Nebraska pastor who during emergency surgery slips from consciousness and enters heaven\".</p> <p>Obama fans, meanwhile, were two times more likely to have read Barbara Ehrenreich's undercover investigation into \"low-rent America\", <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/businessandfinance/9781847082626/nickel-and-dimed\">Nickel and Dimed</a>, and three times fonder of Franzen, known for his intimate novels about middle-class America. (Obama himself is known to have acquired <a href=\"http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/23/obama-gets-franzen-novel-early-and-publishing-panic-ensues/\">an advance copy of Freedom</a>.)</p> <p>Goodreads also discovered that while both sides loved Michael Lewis's history of the financial crash, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/businessandfinance/9780141043531/the-big-short-inside-the-doomsday-machine\">The Big Short</a>, suggesting that \"the economic crisis hit everyone\", Romney followers were far more enamoured of Ayn Rand's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/classics/9780141188935/atlas-shrugged\">Atlas Shrugged</a>, giving it an average rating of 4.05 stars, compared with just three stars from Obama's supporters.</p> <p>Both sides, said Goodreads, had read an average of 26 books in 2012, but Obama followers were harsher critics, handing out an average rating of 3.43 stars out of five per book, compared with 3.88 for Romney's supporters.</p> <p>\"We leave it to you to draw your own conclusions,\" said Goodreads. \"Are Obama voters more drawn to Jonathan Franzen as a champion of the middle class? Are David McCullough's books on the Founding Fathers favourites of Tea Party supporters?\" The books site added as a caveat that not everyone who voted in its poll would be able to vote in the election, due to age and geography.</p> <p>The Goodreads analysis follows <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/22/republican-landslide-us-book-vote\">Amazon.com's launch earlier this summer of an \"election heat map\"</a>, tracking political book purchases across America. \"Red\", or conservative, titles such as Atlas Shrugged and books from Glenn Beck and Arnold Schwarzenegger are currently in the ascendant, taking up 59% of US political book purchases, according to Amazon. \"Blue\" books, among which Amazon counts both <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/10/04/162304439/colbert-re-becoming-the-nation-we-always-were\">Stephen Colbert's America Again: Re-becoming the Greatness We Never Weren't</a> and Richard Dawkins' <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/religion/9780552773317/the-god-delusion\">The God Delusion</a>, account for 41%, although purchases of Obama's own book, The Audacity of Hope, are beating Romney's No Apology by 67% to 33%.</p>",
  "<p>A Republican congressman at the forefront of hearings into the killing of the US ambassador to Libya has attempted to directly tie the White House to security decisions that may have contributed to the disaster.</p> <p>Jason Chaffetz has alleged that there was a \"co-ordinated effort\" between the White House and the state department to scale down security at US diplomatic missions in Libya in the months before a militia attacked the American consulate in Benghazi on September 11, killing the ambassador, Chris Stevens, and three other officials.</p> <p>Chaffetz's allegation comes ahead of a hearing by the House of Representatives oversight committee on Wednesday into whether the state department failed to heed warnings from Stevens and its own security personnel of the scale of the threat.</p> <p>US state department officials on Tuesday<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/10/chris-stevens-libya-consulate-attack\"> gave their most detailed description yet of the events in Benghazi</a>, and backed away from earlier assertions that the incident was triggered by protests against an anti-Islam video.</p> <p>They described frantic and prolonged efforts to rescue the ambassador, Chris Stevens, from a smoke-filled \"safe haven\" inside the US diplomatic compound in Benghazi where he apparently died of asphyxiation.</p> <p>The officials said there was nothing unusual happening near the Benghazi mission before the assault. Earlier accounts by White House and state department officials, including Susan Rice, the US ambassador to the United Nations, suggested that the attacks were triggered by protests over a video made in California that insulted the prophet Muhammad.</p> <p>Last week, Chaffetz, chairman of a subcommittee on national security, and congressman Darrell Issa, chairman of the oversight committee, wrote to Hillary Clinton, the secretary of state, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/29/republicans-obama-chris-stevens-libya\">accusing the administration of incompetence and covering up the true nature</a> of what they say was a well-planned terrorist assault with links to al-Qaida.</p> <p>Now, in an attempt to pin ultimate responsibility on Barack Obama, Chaffetz says those cuts were at the behest of the White House.</p> <p>\"It seems to be a coordinated effort between the White House and the state department, from Secretary Clinton to President Obama's White House,\" Chaffetz told Fox News. \"There was a very conscious decision made. My personal opinion is that they wanted the appearance of normalisation there in Libya, and [that] putting up barbed wire on our facility would lead to the wrong impression. Something that this administration didn't want to have moving forward.\"</p> <p>However, Chaffetz admitted he had no evidence for his assertion.</p> <p>Chaffetz and Issa are also vulnerable to accusations of hypocrisy after it was revealed that both congressmen voted to cut the state department's diplomatic security budget after Republicans took control of the House of Representatives in 2010. Republicans have shaved nearly $800m off state department spending on worldwide security over the past two years including $376m cut from embassy protection this year alone.</p> <p>Among those called to testify before the oversight committee is the former head of US security in Libya, lieutenant colonel Andy Wood. He told CBS news that American officials, including himself and Stevens, made repeated calls for more security personnel in the months prior to the attack but the state department cut back instead.</p> <p>\"We tried to illustrate \u2026 to show them how dangerous and how volatile and just unpredictable that whole environment was over there. So to decrease security in the face of that really is \u2026 it's just unbelievable,\" Wood said.</p> <p>He told CBS that when he was told that his 16-member team and a separate state department elite force of six were being withdrawn from Libya in August he felt \"like we were being asked to play the piano with two fingers. There was concern amongst the entire embassy staff\".</p> <p>\"They asked if we were safe,\" he said. \"They asked \u2026 what was going to happen, and I could only answer that what we were being told is that they're working on it \u2013 they'll get us more (security personnel), but I never saw that.\"</p> <p>The state department denies Wood's claim, saying there was no reduction in security personnel in the weeks before the attack in Benghazi. It said that when Wood's unit was withdrawn it was replaced bother others and that the number of security personnel in Libya remained constant.</p> <p>The state department also said Wood was based in Tripoli and had no knowledge of the situation in Benghazi, 400 miles away.</p> <p>The US under-secretary of state for management, Patrick Kennedy, will be the highest state department official to testify.</p>",

  "<p>Venezuelan president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez may have started a new term, but it was the old, anti-imperialist, anti-US drive that characterised his first press conference since winning re-election for six more years.</p> <p>Lambasting Washington, backing Syria's president Bashar al-Assad and accusing Europe of cashing in on the death of Muammar Gaddafi, Ch\u00e1vez came out swinging after his comfortable victory on Sunday.</p> <p>On ebullient and provocative form, the president accused the US of fomenting unrest in the Middle East, particularly in Syria. \"This is a crisis that has been planned and provoked \u2026 Syria is a sovereign nation. This crisis has a single cause: the world has entered into a new era of imperialism. It's madness. The US government has been among the most irresponsible. I hope Obama rethinks this,\" he said.</p> <p>Venezuela has supported the Syrian government by shipping oil to make up for shortfalls caused by US-initiated embargoes.</p> <p>\"How can I not support Assad. He's the legitimate leader \u2026 We will continue in our support and advocate peace,\" Ch\u00e1vez told reporters at the presidential palace in Miraflores.</p> <p>He also lamented the death of his friend, former Libyan leader Gaddafi. \"The way he died was a barbarity. Gaddafi was assassinated almost on TV.\" He said the former Libyan leader had sent him a last message, in which he compared himself to Che Guevara: \"I shall die like Che \u2013 I will be a martyr.\"</p> <p>Europe, he said, had frozen billions in Libyan assets, which was \"convenient\" at a time when it was facing its own financial crisis.</p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez accused outside forces of trying to oust him in the presidential election.</p> <p>\"We didn't just defeat [his rival, Henrique] Capriles. We also defeated an international coalition. This wasn't just a domestic battle.\"</p> <p>He said voters had been inundated with 500,000 automated messages from the US and Europe urging them to back his Capriles.</p> <p>\"How much did this cost? Who has the capacity to do such a thing?\", he asked. \"The great transnational phone companies were supporting Capriles. It was electoral harassment.\"</p> <p>Friendlier foreign forces were, however, quick to congratulate Ch\u00e1vez on his victory. Other leftwing leaders in Latin America gave celebration calls. Russian president Vladimir Putin reportedly told him the election news was the \"best present I could have for my 60th birthday\".</p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez also castigated the foreign media's coverage of the election, which he won with 55.2% of the vote against Capriles's 44.1%.</p> <p>\"I've read that Venezuela is divided. But the US is also divided. Every country is divided,\" Ch\u00e1vez said. \"I won by 10 points and the foreign media call the victory slim. How much did Hollande win by in France? How much will Obama win by? You know Obama is my candidate? \u2026 I would vote for him if I could.\"</p> <p>With six more years in power, the Venezuelan president said he would ask the opposition for proposals and look for possible areas of collaboration, though he emphasised that past efforts had come to nothing.</p> <p>\"The opposition has a catastrophic vision for the country,\" he said. \"They deny everything the government achieves.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Wednesday 10 October to correct the figures on Ch\u00e1vez's margin of victory.</p>"
