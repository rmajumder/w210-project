  "<p>Last September, when Barack Obama's approval ratings were in the low to mid-40s and a clear majority of Americans said he did not deserve a second term, veteran pollster Charlie Cook described his ideal Republican opponent as \"odourless and colourless\". With unemployment and the deficit so high and gridlock so stubborn, he explained, a challenger who did not repel independents or unnecessarily antagonise Obama's base should have little problem defeating the president.</p> <p>The trouble was that almost all the&#xa0;Republican contenders during the primary were either extremely colourful or, as candidates at least, stank. There was Newt Gingrich, who wanted to build&#xa0;permanent bases on the moon and, according to his ex-wife, demanded an open three-way relationship with the mistress who is now his current wife; Ricky Perry, who could not&#xa0;remember his own talking points; and Herman Cain, who was accused by several women of sexual harassment and proudly stated that he did not know the&#xa0;name of the president of \"Ubeki-beki-beki-beki-stan-stan\". Each, for a while, was a frontrunner.</p> <p>So when people wonder how Mitt Romney became the party's standard-bearer they need to first remember just&#xa0;how low the standards were. To make sense within the Republican party was, almost by definition, to appear nonsensical outside it. More credible candidates took a look at what you'd have to say and do to compete and decided to sit the election out.</p> <p>After a fortnight of gaffes and worsening poll numbers critics have rounded on Romney's campaign (which is turning into a circular firing squad) and his personal failings as a candidate (a wooden, awkward campaigner who can't relate to ordinary people). But his flaws as a nominee are only properly understood in the context of the flaws of the party that nominated him. Romney's not letting the party down. Quite the opposite. He's a far more plausible, competent and rational a candidate than it deserves. The urgent question is not why, for the time being, the race seems to be getting away from him, but how he has remained in contention for so long.</p> <p>True, this was supposed to be the Republicans' election to lose. When Obama was pitted against a (\"colourless\", \"odourless\") generic Republican in polls, he was defeated. The trouble is, the more voters see what qualifies for a generic Republican the less keen they are to have anything to do with one.</p> <p>It's not difficult to see why. Over the past few years Republicans have come across as particularly heartless. During one primary debate, Texas governor Rick Perry was cheered when introduced as a man who'd overseen 234 executions. <a href=\"https://www.toledoblade.com/Politics/2012/08/15/Joe-the-Plumber-calls-for-fence-start-shooting-to-protect-border.html\" title=\"\">Joe the Plumber, now a congressional candidate in Ohio</a>, spelled out his plan for dealing with illegal immigration: \"Put a fence on the damn border and start shooting.\"</p> <p>They are none too keen on facts. <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/Politics-and-Elections/2012-romney-mormonism-obamas-religion.aspx\" title=\"\">The percentage of Republicans who believe Obama is a Muslim</a> has doubled in the last four years and now stands at about one in three, the same proportion of Republicans in the swing state of Ohio who still <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2012/03/limbaugh-and-birthers.html\" title=\"\">do not believe Obama was born in the US</a>. They are not particularly interested in consensus, either. Two thirds of Republicans said they'd rather have a congressperson who <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/boehners-problem-his-party-doesnt-like-compromise/2011/07/11/gIQAnUdMhI_blog.html\" title=\"\">stuck to their principles no matter what than one who compromises to get things done</a>. They give little impression of being inclusive. Asked <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/voters-explain-why-blacks-pick-democratic/2012/08/29/2d85f792-f238-11e1-adc6-87dfa8eff430_graphic.html\" title=\"\">why they thought so many African Americans supported Democrats,</a> the most common opinion among those with a view was because of welfare dependency. And they appear stuck in the past. More than one in four Republicans in Mississippi and one in five in Alabama believe interracial marriage should be illegal while closer to two thirds in <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2012/03/other-notes-from-alabama-and-mississippi.html\" title=\"\">both states do not believe in evolution</a>.</p> <p>Such is the extremeness and eccentricity of those to whom Romney must appeal for votes and cash. To be fair, Romney saw this coming. In February he said: \"It's very easy to excite the base with incendiary comments ... I'm not willing to light my hair on fire to try and get support. I am who I am.\" By July, Sarah Palin was insisting the least he could do was throw a match and some gasoline her way. (\"Well, light our hair on fire, then!,\" she told Fox News). Now he's in the process of fullblown self-immolation, and his candidacy is on the brink of crashing and burning.</p> <p>\"The appearance of a Republican party almost entirely composed of ideological conservatives is a new and historically unprecedented development,\" writes Geoffrey Kabaservice in Rule and Ruin: The Downfall of Moderation and the Destruction of the Republican Party. \"It is only in the last decade or so that movement conservatism finally succeeded in silencing, co-opting, repelling, or expelling nearly every competing strain of Republicanism from the party.\"</p> <p>The New Yorker's Ryan Lizza points out: \"<a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/03/12/120312fa_fact_lizza\" title=\"\">The number [of Republicans] who call themselves liberal is now close to the number who describe themselves as&#xa0;Aleut or Eskimo.</a>\"</p> <p>Romney understands this problem. He was raised with it. At 17 he saw his father George, the governor of Michigan, walk out of the 1964 convention after a <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2011/10/31/141857420/new-republic-mitt-romneys-parent-trap\" title=\"\">futile bid to challenge its extremist platform</a>. That year, Gerald Ford symbolically nominated George from the floor, describing him as a man who \"has never let the temporary glitter of expediency obscure the path which his integrity dictated he must follow\".</p> <p>And, as the governor of Massachusetts, one of the most reliably liberal states in the country, Mitt has worked with it. In September 2002, shortly before his gubernatorial election, he told a group of pro-choice campaigners that for all their differences they could make common cause. Melissa Kogut, then head of Massachusetts Naral, told the Washington Post. \"He closed the meeting by taking on a just-between-us tone and saying, essentially, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/09/AR2007100902146.html\" title=\"\">'You need Republicans like me. And the party needs candidates like me, because this issue is killing the party.'\"</a></p> <p>The party he tried to save is dead; the party he represents now deluded. When he speaks candidly within it, he exposes its contempt for the poor in particular and the electorate's intelligence in general. When he speaks carefully outside of it, he exposes its contradictions: driven by the fringe but appealing to the mainstream. This is not a problem of Romney's making; it's the problem that made Romney's candidacy possible.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 24 September 2012. The original said that, of Republicans asked why they thought so many African Americans supported Democrats, \"more than half said because they are government dependents while one in six insisted it was because they were uninformed, ignorant or uneducated\". This was based on numbers in a poll that were assumed to be percentages, but were in fact raw counts.</p>",
  "<p>Nick Clegg signalled a fresh battle over budget cuts with George Osborne on Sunday after warning that it would be \"wholly unrealistic\" for the coalition to pursue further reductions in welfare spending without increasing taxes on Britain's richest 10%.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/22/coalition-cuts-nick-clegg-aide\" title=\"\">Under pressure from appalling polling figures which showed his Lib Dem party fourth nationwide behind Ukip</a>, Clegg's commitment to protect the poorest in society from \"wild Tory demands\" could not prevent a surprisingly pointed attack from his own side on the first full day of his party's conference in Brighton.</p> <p>A spiky Q&amp;A session brought calls from angry delegates for Clegg to rein in the Lib Dem Treasury chief secretary, Danny Alexander, who was described as being more rightwing than the chancellor. Clegg's sometimes uneasy relationship with his party activists will not be helped by the London mayor, Boris Johnson, writing an article in the Telegraph describing Clegg as a natural Tory who needs to be supported by the Conservatives.</p> <p>Clegg was also criticised <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/19/nick-clegg-apologies-tuition-fees-pledge\" title=\"\">for failing to apologise earlier for breaking his election pledge not to raise tuition fees</a>, while the party president, Tim Farron, twisted the knife by saying the Lib Dems should have fought harder in parliament to retain their manifesto pledge to abolish fees, saying the pledge itself was \"fine\".</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat membership is slowly absorbing the political implications of the agreement made by the two coalition parties, and revealed by Liberal Democrat cabinet members at the weekend, that they will agree a cuts programme for the year 2015-16, spanning the next election. Detailed talks are due to start soon on a spending review next year. The two parties have agreed that this will detail departmental spending cuts for 2015-16, but not for the following two years.</p> <p>Clegg said the agreement, reducing the two parties' mutual independence at the election, was unavoidable because \"the lights would go out in Whitehall\" without agreed spending plans for 2015-16.</p> <p>He called on his party to have \"a grown-up recognition that the reality is whoever is in power in 2015, Conservative, Labour or Liberal Democrat, or any combination \u2026 there will be more belt tightening in the years ahead\".</p> <p>Clegg said the conference should seek to establish that the financial decks will be cleared, but it would be done fairly. For the first time, he said he hoped the additional taxes on the wealthiest would hit the top 10% of the population.</p> <p>The coming talks on the spending review mirror the intense Whitehall battle over the March 2011 budget, when Clegg resisted Osborne's plan for a cut in the 50p top rate of tax to 40p, later scaled back to 45p, unless tax allowances at the bottom were raised. Clegg tried to reassure a nervous conference by saying he had for months been telling his Conservative colleagues that additional savings required from 2015-16 must start at the top and work down. \"We will not start, as some people are suggesting, at the bottom and work up,\" he said.</p> <p>But he added it was \"wholly unrealistic\" for the welfare budget to be immune from cuts in 2015-16, pointing out that it represents a third of public spending.</p> <p>He told the conference: \"We will not allow some of these wild suggestions that are coming from the right of British politics that all the savings should come from welfare, and that we should scoop out a \u00a310bn-sized hole in welfare.\" He added he would also reject \"wild suggestions\" that he \"wave a wand and put a freeze on benefits for two years\", saying that would hit the most vulnerable in society.</p> <p>The business secretary, Vince Cable, is redoubling his demands for a \"mansion tax\" on properties worth more than \u00a32m, but Liberal Democrats are also looking at alternatives such as adding two extra council tax bands at the top of the property ladder, or increasing stamp duty.</p> <p>Reluctant to divulge details of the coalition talks at this stage, Clegg hinted that he was prepared to look at other options to attack wealth, apart from a mansion tax.</p> <p>Clegg admitted he had so far failed to persuade the Tories to accept the mansion tax, and privately his aides said the resistance from Downing Street was still strong. But Clegg said he would continue to make the argument, adding that an increasing number of Conservatives understood the merits of more tax on high-value properties.</p> <p>He added: \"The mansion tax is not the only way in which you can make people at the top make a fair contribution to this huge national effort of balancing our books, and we've already demonstrated to you, through capital gains tax, through stamp duty, through tax avoidance, already ensured that the top 10% pay more, and we can do more than that.\"</p> <p>Facing a direct challenge from the floor of the conference on Monday over the party's commitment to the fiscal targets set out in 2010, Clegg surprisingly admitted that the Lib Dems' \"critics have bluntly been pretty successful in portraying the party's economic policy as unthinking, blinkered, rigid, dogmatic, ideological, rightwing small state agenda\". He said the reality was more flexible than that.</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney denied his campaign needed a \"turnaround\" as he embarked on an intensive tour of the swing states aimed at kickstarting his presidential bid, starting in Colorado.</p> <p>In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday at the end of his worst week so far, Romney rejected criticism of his handling of the campaign. His team has been repeatedly forced on the defensive, unable to gets its message out. Last week was dominated by reports of internal strife and a devastating secret video of a Romney speech dismissive of 47% of Americans as freeloaders.</p> <p>Asked how he planned to turn things around, Romney told CBS 60 Minutes: \"Well, it doesn't need a turnaround.\" He added: \"I've got a very effective campaign. It's doing a very good job.\"</p> <p>It is surprising that Romney opted for denial in the face of widespread criticism last week, in particular from Republicans.</p> <p>The influential conservative commentator, Peggy Noonan, in her Wall Street Journal column, called for a change at the top of his team, describing the campaign as \"a rolling calamity\".</p> <p>The Wisconsin governor, Scott Walker, joined in the chorus of Republicans critical of the campaign. In an interview on Fox News, he called for more passion from the Romney. \"I want to see fire in the belly,\" Walker said.</p> <p>Romney, referring to his 47% remark, reheated the defence he mounted last week: that his choice of words had been clumsy rather than that his central message had been askew. \"Not everything I say is elegant,\" he told 60 Minutes.</p> <p>The Republican presidential candidate, trailing Barack Obama by 3% in the national polls according to the RealClearPolitics average, is hoping he will finally achieve a clear week in which to get across his message blaming Obama for the slow economic recovery.</p> <p>He will follow up the trip to Colorado with a three-day bus trip of Ohio, one of the major swing states, and Virginia, another swing state. On Tuesday, both Romney and Obama will make a rare appearance at the same event, both making speeches at the Clinton Foundation conference in New York.</p> <p>The campaign stops come after two weeks in which Romney has spent less time on the road than is usual for a candidate at this stage, preferring to devote himself to preparations for the first of three presidential debates, in Denver on October 3.</p> <p>In contrast with Romney, the Republican national committee chairman, Reince Priebus, interviewed on ABC, reluctantly acknowledged that last week had been a setback, in particular the 47% remark. </p> <p>\"It probably wasn't the best-said, you know, moment in the campaign and probably not the best week in the campaign,\" Priebus said.</p> <p>But he insisted it had not been all bad and that overall it had been a good week in some ways. The 47% remark had helped crystalise the difference between the two parties over what kind of America they wanted, he said, echoing the defence offered by the Romney campaign in the middle of last week.</p> <p>In spite of all evidence to the contrary, he claimed that the Romney campaign is delivering on its promise made early last week that it would retool its campaign and start talking more about policy specifics in a Romney administration and less criticising Obama. He said the Romney campaign had \"specifics coming out of its eyeballs\".</p> <p>One of Obama's senior advisers, David Axelrod, appearing on the same show as Priebus, took issue with his suggestion that overall it had been a good week and that it was delivering on specifics.</p> <p>\"Well, I don't know what prism he's looking through. I don't think anybody else would define it as a good week. But it was an enlightening week,\" Axelrod said.</p> <p>On Fox News, Robert Gibbs, the former White House spokesman who has been drafted back onto the campaign trail, talked up Romney's chances in the debate, saying he had had more recent experience in the Republican primaries and caucuses in debating with his rivals. \"I think he starts with an advantage,\" Gibbs said.</p> <p>The Obama campaign is deliberately building up Romney as the favourite going into the debate, adding to pressure on him and making it easier to talk up Obama after the event if it ends up in a draw.</p>",
  "<p>The 2012 election may be far from decided, but on Sunday all the speculation centered on the 2016 race, and whether a certain household Democrat name might once again feature on the ballot paper.</p> <p>The prospect of a Hillary Clinton run for the White House gained momentum when Bill Clinton offered the broadest hint yet that she might go for it.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton is due to stand down soon as secretary of state, probably in January, and take at least six months out to write her memoirs about her time in office. After that, she will make up mind whether she will run, according to the Clinton camp.</p> <p>Aged 64, she is still young enough for a bid in 2016 and is, at present, ahead of any of her rivals in terms of standing and popularity inside the party. She retains a driving desire to become the first female president.</p> <p>Other senior Democrats, including at least three governors, are already positioning themselves for a run \u2013 and vice-president Joe Biden might fancy his chances too \u2013 but Hillary Clinton has much more stature.</p> <p>Bill Clinton, in an interview with Face The Nation, talked up her achievements and said she would be well placed.</p> <p>\"I've never met anybody I thought was any better than her at this. But again, we got a lot of able people in our party who want to be president,\" he said.<br>Asked directly if she would stand, he opted against ruling it out and said: \"I don't know.\"</p> <p>Clinton, after coming off second-best to Barack Obama in the early stages of the 2008 Democratic nomination battle, won over many in the Democratic party with her stubborn refusal to quit. In a dignified and touching exit speech, she expressed thanks for the 18m votes she had received, portraying them as a step foward in women's fight for equality. </p> <p>In words that might yet find an echo in 2016, she said: \"Although we weren't able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling this time, thanks to you, it's got about 18m cracks in it. And the light is shining through like never before, filling us all with the hope and the sure knowledge that the path will be a little easier next time.\"</p> <p>Her popularity has grown over the last four years within the party, not least because of her loyalty to Obama. There have been no leaks or sniping from her office, and she is viewed as an effective and popular secretary of state.</p> <p>In writing her memoirs, she intends to retain that loyalty, sticking rigidly to her time as secretary of state rather than her version of the bruising battle with Obama in 2007 and 2008, according to the Clinton camp.</p> <p>Bill Clinton helped burnish the Clinton brand earlier this month in a keynote speech at the Democratic convention in which he made the case for a second term for Obama and joked that Obama was such a decent politician he had even appointed Hillary.</p> <p>In his interview, Clinton talked of how hard his wife had been working over hte last two decades. \"You know she's worked hard for 20 years. We had eight years in the White House. Then she ran for the senate. She served in New York for eight years. Then she immediately became the secretary of state, and she's tired,\" he said.</p> <p>\"She's really worked hard. I think she's done a fabulous job. I'm very proud of her. But she wants to take some time off, kind of regroup, write a book. I hope we'll be working together.\"</p> <p>He said he would support his wife whatever she decided to do.</p> <p>\"She's an extraordinarily able person. I've never met anybody I thought was a better public servant. But I have no earthly idea what she'll decide to do.\" </p> <p>After finishing her memoirs of her time in office, she may opt to do some charitable work, either for Bill Clinton's foundation or start something similar of her own. But she would need to begin organising for a presidential run in about two years from now.</p> <p>If Obama secures a second term and benefits from economic recovery, Clinton could find herself well-placed for the White House. If it is Mitt Romney presidency and the economy improves, it might be harder facing a Republican incumbent.</p> <p>If Romney loses, the Republicans have a long list of potential stars ready to run, including Florida senator Marco Rubio, Romney's running-mate Paul Ryan and former Florida governor Jeb Bush.</p> <p>Speculation about who might run for the Democrats is already rife in the party. Vice-president Joe Biden, 69, assuming Obama gets a second term, might feel that eight years at the White House entitles him to at least consideration.<br>According to a report in the New York Times on Sunday, the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, wants to run but told an adviser: \"First, I've got to figure out what Hillary is doing.\" The paper went on to quote a Cuomo spokesman denying he had said this and insisting he was not positioning himself for a run.</p> <p>The governor of Massachusetts, Deval Patrick, has already made a visit to Iowa this year, usually a sign of an impending bid, given the first of the Democratic caucuses is traditionally held in the state. Martin O'Malley, the governor of Maryland, another potential contender, spoke in Iowa earlier this month at a big Democratic event, the annual steak fry of senator Tom Harkin.</p>",
  "<p>Rick Wilkey knocked on the door in the affluent neighbourhood of West Des Moines, Iowa. Four years ago, when the Barack Obama campaign volunteer talked to voters about the candidate's hope-and-change message, he was greeted with yelps of excitement. This time, it's very different. </p> <p>The man who opened the door looked disdainfully at Wilkey and his bright-red \"Fired Up\" Obama shirt, a souvenir from the 2008 campaign. Wilkey got only slightly into his introduction \u2013 \"I am from the Obama campaign \u2026 \" \u2013 before he was cut off. \"I want you to leave my property immediately. I hate that son-of-a-bitch,\" the man said, before closing the door.</p> <p>It is hard work being a volunteer in the swing states where the Obama and Mitt Romney teams are grinding it out district by district, street by street. With six weeks still to go to the election, the focus is shifting is to the ground game: which side is going to prove better at getting its support out.</p> <p>And in Iowa, that is shaping up to be a more closely fought contest than expected. It is one of eight swing states that could help decide the election. The most recent poll, by Rasmussen, gives Obama a two-point lead, while one by NBC/WSJ last week had him up by eight. Both campaign teams on the ground describe it as tight. </p> <p>Obama and Romney are devoting serious amounts of time and resources to the state. The president has made eight trips this year, including a three-day bus tour, unusual for an incumbent. Romney, since the end of the Republican primaries and caucuses, has been here eight times. Last Monday, both vice-president Joe Biden and his Republican challenger Paul Ryan were campaigning in the state. </p> <p>All this is extraordinary in a state that can contribute just six electoral college votes as the candidates aim to get the 270 required for victory. But for Romney, who has failed to overturn Obama's national poll lead or to break through in any of the major battleground states, winning Iowa is crucial.</p> <p>For Obama, part of the reason is his emotional attachment to the state. It provided the launchpad for his White House bid, first with his surprise caucus victory over Hillary Clinton, in January 2008. In November that year, in the White House race, Iowa again delivered for him, giving him a huge 9% majority over Republican John McCain. </p> <p>And the grassroots strategy that delivered victory last time is what gives Obama the edge over Romney now. The Democrat won Iowa in 2008 with a game plan that established a network of offices across the state, a mixture of paid staff and volunteers that dwarfed the efforts of Clinton and later McCain. In addition, his team created a sophisticated data bank to identify supporters. The offices behaved like community centres, inviting various demographic groups to come in to discuss their problems.</p> <p>In 2012, the Obama campaign has 67 offices round the state, more than in 2008, and has an estimated 120 full-time, paid staff, as well as thousands of unpaid volunteers such as Rick Wilkey. Romney has only 13 offices and fewer staff: 25 full-time employees in its headquarters in Urbandale and at least one in each field office.</p> <p>Wilkey works out of Obama's West Des Moines campaign office, a rented space in shopping mall. Inside, amid the maps and coffee cups, is a portrait of Obama as Superman and a calendar listing the days remaining to the election. </p> <p>Wilkey, a 72-year-old former Des Moines city manager and businessman, is a precinct captain, as he was in 2008. He co-ordinates the weekly meeting with other volunteers to discuss canvassing and manning the phone-banks. He saw the inauguration of JFK in 1961 and was inspired, but that marked the end of his political involvement until he met Obama early in 2007.</p> <p>He is not among the disillusioned. \"I still support Obama, even more strongly than I did, because the choices are more stark, because his opponents are Romney and Ryan,\" he said.</p> <p>Wilkey, who puts in between 10 and 15 hours a week, added: \"I think the most important thing is getting the ground vote out. There are 2,000 precincts in Iowa. In 2000, Gore won by 4,000: that is an average of two votes per precinct. In 2004, Bush won by 10,000 votes: that is an average of five. These small margins show the importance of precinct level organisation.\" </p> <p>He spent three hours canvassing in and around 57th and 58th street, in West Des Moines. He said he had not found any \"enthusiasm gap\" among Democratic supporters</p> <p>He had a list of 46 homes where he hoped there would be potential Democratic voters. About two-thirds were not at home. Of the 14 homes where he received a response of some sort from the people inside, seven people said they will vote Obama, six Romney, four declared they were undecided and one would not say.</p> <p>One of the undecideds was Ron Myers, 68, who was working as a handyman after losing a senior job in publishing. He backed Obama last time but will not make up his mind until the final week. One of the issues for him is the size of the national debt, which tends to be one Republicans become more upset about than Democrats.</p> <p>Among the Obama supporters was Terri Lentz, 57, a speech language specialist, who thinks he deserves more time in office. \"I do not think Obama has had enough time to make the changes he has to, to clear up the Bush mess,\" she said.</p> <p>Then she added: \"I am hoping Obama wins but I do not think it is a slamdunk by any stretch.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396557811\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/23/1348419845028/Mitt-Romney-iowa-010.jpg\" alt=\"Mitt Romney iowa\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Orange City crowd watches Romney speak on September 7. The Republican strategy is very different from the Obama one in Iowa. Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Obama ground campaign has secured an early success. It already has 80,000 requests for early ballot papers, compared with only 11,000 for Romney, figures confirmed by independent state officials. </p> <p>The Romney team is dismissive, saying early voting is not part of its game plan. The Democrats are just registering for early voting people who would have voted anyway. The Republicans say they are more focused on reaching people who might not vote.</p> <p>The Republicans counter with figures of their own. In the 2008 election, the number of registered Democrats outnumbered Republicans by more than 100,000. The figures produced this month, again independently confirmed, show the Republicans ahead, with 620,868 to the Democrats 602,636.</p> <p>The Republican strategy is very different from the Obama one. Instead of the slow build-up of support through a network of offices over many months, the aim is to blitz the ad market in the final weeks. Based on what they say is past experience, they expect Republicans to come out in bigger numbers on polling day.</p> <p>Although it has fewer offices than the Obama team, the Romney headquarters at its headquarters in Urbandale on the outskirts of Des Moines had a steady stream of volunteers passing through over the weekend.</p> <p>Shawn McCoy, Iowa communications director for the Republican campaign, argues that what could be decisive is disappointment with Obama. \"This state should not be competitive. He won by 9.5% in 2008. This shows a lot of his voters have left him. It was easy to get caught up in the 'hope and change'.\"</p> <p>They have volunteers out knocking doors too, though not as many as the Obama campaign team. They concentrate on working the phones. In its headquarters, it names a volunteer as holding the record for most calls in a day, more than 600.</p> <p>McCoy envisages a scenario in which Romney wins all of the swing states in the east and when it is the turn of Iowa, which is on Central time, with polls closing an hour later, the state could be the one that tips him into the White House.</p> <p>\"This was the state that launched him and now it is the state that will put Mitt Romney into the White House,\" McCoy said.</p>",
  "<p>The Liberal Democrats should have fought harder to keep their election promise not to increase fees, the party's president, Tim Farron, said on Sunday in a stark contrast to his leader, Nick Clegg, who apologised last week for making the promise at all.</p> <p>Farron accused the party's leadership of \"giving way\" on the tuition fees rise in coalition, saying the party should have drawn a \"red line\" over the issue during talks after the general election in 2010.</p> <p>He made his comments as Clegg defended his decision to issue an apology over the Lib Dem pre-election pledge to oppose tuition fee rises in government, saying he had wanted to hold his hands up and apologise for the mistake for \"quite some time\".</p> <p>Meanwhile, Danny Alexander, chief secretary to the Treasury who chaired the Lib Dem manifesto group before the election, admitted he had reservations about the pledge before he made it, but included it in the manifesto following support from the party's democratic structures.</p> <p>However, Farron insisted the promise had been a \"fine pledge\" which should not have been broken in the first place.</p> <p>The MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale told Sky's Murnaghan show on Sunday: \"Personally, I think we should have argued for it much harder in the coalition negotiations and we should have made sure there was a red line there. This is the first coalition in peacetime in living memory and we all make mistakes. The Tories did, we did. We should've been much, much harder on that issue.</p> <p>\"Our manifesto policy was much more radical than the pledge to not increase tuition fees. I felt relatively comfortable signing the pledge because it was a relatively modest one. We should've fought harder to make sure we kept that promise, and I think that's what we are now rightly apologising for as a party \u2013 you get some things wrong.\"</p> <p>He added: \"I thought that the pledge was a fine pledge to make and we should have kept it and that's why I voted against the fee rise. But I also recognise that many of my colleagues felt differently and I also recognise that we shouldn't have done what we did.\"</p> <p>He said Clegg's filmed apology, which has since been turned into a hit spoof song, was \"immensely gutsy\", but he said this was unlikely to fix the \"trust issue\" overnight.</p> <p>\"Reputations take years to build and seconds to lose. You have to be very careful and you have to work very hard over a number of years to regain that connection with the electorate but I think the fact that Nick has done what he's done, he's said it, we have to move on. People will not forgive us, some people will, and that's up to them.\"</p> <p>Earlier in the day, Clegg revealed that issuing the mea culpa had been on his mind for quite some time.</p> <p>He told the BBC1 Andrew Marr show: \"I think what we did was a mistake, I think it was wrong, and I've been meaning for some time to put my hands up and say 'We made a mistake.' We've also done lots of good things, which I felt were being obscured by that, and so I just wanted to make the apology in a simple, direct way, which as you say gets mocked and sneered, in many respects quite amusing ways, musical and otherwise.</p> <p>\"And I think that the Westminster village is always quite cynical about these things; my hope is that there are some \u2013 not all, because some people will say 'oh, that's not going to make any difference' \u2013 I&#xa0;hope some people will recognise that in politics as in life, sometimes it's just the right thing to do to say we regret it and we won't do it again.\"</p> <p>Alexander admitted to the doubts he held about the tuition fees pledge before it was made, on the grounds of cost, though he refused to be drawn on whether he had told Clegg the policy was unaffordable before signing it.</p> <p>Alexander, who chaired the manifesto group, told the BBC 1 Sunday politics show: \"I don't remember the details of the conversations that took place quite a few years ago. But what I'm saying to you is it was clear that this was a very expensive policy, that given the financial circumstances facing the country, it would be difficult to afford, and that's why we took the approach we did in our manifesto of phasing it in over a number of years.</p> <p>\"But nonetheless, under the current financial circumstances, it wasn't affordable, we made a pledge that we couldn't keep; we shouldn't have done that. And that's why Nick has apologised for it ... Every Liberal Democrat MP signed that pledge, it's something I regret, I'm sorry for, I wish I hadn't done because it wasn't a promise I could keep.</p> <p>\"Having as a party agreed to include this policy in our manifesto, I followed through on that in the way that every other Liberal Democrat MP did, and with all the consequences that we know about.\"</p>",
  "<p>Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's popularity has plummeted just four months after he took office, according to the latest opinion poll.</p> <p>The survey found only 43% of French voters were happy with the Socialist president. The drop of 11 percentage points is one of the worst for a leader in more than 50 years since the start of the fifth republic.</p> <p>The poll by the Ifop organisation for the Journal du Dimanche found 56% of those asked said they were not happy with the president. The Ifop findings were backed up by two other opinion polls.</p> <p>Asked about his disastrous ratings during a press conference with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, on Saturday, Hollande replied: \"I ask to be judged on results and these will take time.</p> <p>\"We find ourselves in a difficult situation in Europe. There's a crisis, weak growth, unemployment \u2026 my duty is to ensure that by the end of my mandate France is in a better state than it was at the beginning.\"</p> <p>He added that the start of a presidential mandate was always \"a time when expectations were high\".</p> <p>\"During a term in office there are highs and lows, but what counts is that the goal is set as well as the means to achieve it, and the force we put into getting results,\" he added.</p> <p>Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dabi, the deputy director general of Ifop, said increased taxes and Hollande's plan to give foreigner residents the right to vote in local elections were the main reasons given by those polled for their dissatisfaction with Hollande.</p> <p>Hollande went on television a fortnight ago to restate his intention to introduce a 75% \"supertax\" band for those earning more than \u20ac1m a year.</p> <p>Only Charles de Gaulle in 1962 and his Gaullist successor Jacques Chirac in 2005 suffered a greater fall in popularity.</p> <p>De Gaulle lost 13 percentage points after the Evian Accords that put an end to the war in Algeria and led to the former French colony's independence. Chirac's popularity fell by 12 points after the French voted against the European constitution.</p>"
