  "<p>US authors go to the polls on Tuesday along with the rest of the country, and \u2013 thanks to registers of donations or their public statements \u2013 we largely know <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2012/10/05/11-authors-who-have-written-political-checks-this-election\" title=\"\">who they'll vote for</a>, and it's tempting to think of each genre as a swing-state, so evenly matched are the rival forces.</p> <p>Thrillers, for example, might be seen as inherently conservative, but the Republican-voting authors of action yarns (Tom Clancy, Clive Cussler, Dean Koontz) are offset by less macho storytellers who are Democrat donors (John Grisham, Stephen King, Elmore Leonard). Similarly, in crime, James Patterson is not unexpectedly on the right, Sara Paretsky on the left, while long-term Republican backer Patricia Cornwell seems to be wavering, having perhaps belatedly noticed that the party is not lesbian-friendly.</p> <p>Look at most genres, and you find pairs of opponents rather like candidates for governor or senator. Humour sees Republican PJ Rourke clashing with Democrat David Sedaris, while Mitt Romney-supporting, wizard-fixated Terry Goodkind is the best conservatives can manage in fantasy fiction to take on <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/game-thrones-author-lashes-republicans-teabagger-allies/story?id=16996685#.UJIeb7-e2IY  Martin\" title=\"\"><em>Game of Thrones</em> creator George RR Martin</a>, who breaks off from working on his bloody, sexy sagas to dash off furious anti-Republican blogs.</p> <p>In children's fiction, Daniel Handler, aka Lemony Snicket, is an Obama donor, while Suzanne Collins has not stated her views but is regularly assumed to be Republican because <em>The Hunger Games</em> evinces such hostility to big government; in social/romantic comedy, Candace Bushnell has recently tilted leftwards but was a Republican donor while <em>Sex and the City</em> was on air; whereas Lena Dunham, creator of <em>Girls</em> (a grubbier, bleaker TV comedy about four New York women, dubbed \"Bad Sex and the City\") and recent signer of a $3.5m book deal, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6G3nwhPuR4 %E2%80%93 Dunham video\" title=\"\">made a video last month</a> urging novice voters to choose Obama because \"your first time shouldn't be with just anyone\".</p> <p>Academia is split down the middle too, with 400 economists, including five Nobel winners, signing a letter endorsing Romney (as does the US-based historian Niall Ferguson, although as yet he's only American in spirit). The Democrats appear to have had trouble coaxing big-name economists who backed Obama in 2008 to sign up again, but were able to impressively counter with a letter by <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/18/nobel-laureates-endorse-obama/\" title=\"\">no fewer than 68 Nobel-winning scientists</a> endorsing him, including James Watson and the 2012 chemistry laureates.</p> <p>Writers in other forms, of screenplays and song lyrics and comedy routines, are less equally distributed. The film and music industries have long been viewed as voting Democrat en masse. Among those supporting Obama are JJ Abrams, Judd Apatow, Ben Affleck, George Clooney, Tina Fey, David Lynch, Aaron Sorkin, Joss Whedon, Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z, 50 Cent, Lady Gaga, Madonna, Kanye West and \u2013 probably \u2013 Nicki Minaj. In film and music, the occasional scribblers in the Romney camp <a href=\"http://www.ranker.com/list/republicans-and-hollywood-republican-celebrities-list/famous-conservatives\" title=\"\">look comparatively elderly and rather less lustrous</a>, with Clint Eastwood, Meat Loaf and Sylvester Stallone the only internationally renowned backers. <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/may/15/rights-celebrity-prayer-unanswered-in-spears/\" title=\"\">Improbable hopes that Britney Spears was a conservative</a> turn out to have been self-deception.</p> <p>But it's in literary fiction that a landslide Obama win is guaranteed, led by the Nobel literature prize winner Toni Morrison. <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/29/artists-and-writers-for-obama-jonathan-franzen-jonathan-safran-foer_n_1637325.html\" title=\"\">On the east coast, Jonathan Franzen and Jonathan Safran Foer helped to organise an Artists and Writers for Obama event</a>; on the west, authors \u2013 including Sherman Alexie, Jonathan Lethem, T\u00e9a Obreht, Marilynne Robinson and George Saunders \u2013 have identified one reason apiece for voting Democrat in <a href=\"http://90days90reasons.com/\" title=\"\">90 Days, 90 Reasons</a>, an online spin-off from Dave Eggers's McSweeneys magazine.</p>",

  "<p>Barack Obama goes into the final hectic weekend of campaigning as favourite, holding a slight edge over Mitt Romney in the polls and buoyed by better than expected job figures.</p> <p>As the presidential candidates began a four-day, round-the-clock marathon of campaign events in swing states, polls on Friday showed Romney's momentum had stalled, leaving Obama ahead in most of the battlegrounds, including Ohio, which both sides see as the key to the White House.</p> <p>Three polls in Ohio on Friday put Obama head, the latest a CNN/ORC poll had the president on 50% to Romney's 47%. Nate Silver, the New York Times pollster, increased Obama's chances of winning to 80%.</p> <p>Republicans were bemoaning the days lost to the campaign because of hurricane Sandy, providing an opportunity for Obama to appear presidential and dominate the news cycle. They blamed Romney's lost momentum on the storm and its aftermath, though polls suggest it had stopped well before Sandy hit.</p> <p>The dominant issue on Friday was the publication of new jobs figures showing an increase of 171,000 in October, better than predicted, although not good enough to prevent the overall job rate rising slightly from 7.8% to 7.9%.</p> <p>The figures provided a small boost to Obama at the end of a week when he won plaudits for his handling of Sandy, including from Republican New Jersey governor Chris Christie, and the endorsement of New York mayor Michael Bloomberg.</p> <p>Republicans had been hoping for a poor set of figures to send those yet to decide which way they will vote in Romney's direction. Speaking in Wisconsin, Romney said: \"The jobless rate is higher than it was when president Obama took office, and there are still 23 million Americans struggling for work. On Tuesday, America will make a choice between stagnation and prosperity.\"</p> <p>In the first of three stops in Ohio on Friday, Obama appeared in front of about 5,000 supporters in Hilliard outside the state capital, Columbus. He made a particular bid to woo employees of the car industry who represent one in eight of the Ohio workforce. \"The American auto industry is back on top,\" he said, an allusion to the federal bailout that he authorised.</p> <p>Obama will be in Ohio on each of the final days of campaigning, in addition to dashes to Colorado, Florida, Iowa, New Hampshire, Virginia and Wisconsin. To add stardust to proceedings, he will be joined on stage by Stevie Wonder on Sunday in Cincinnati, and by Jay-Z and Bruce Springsteen in Columbus on Monday evening.</p> <p>Romney too is going for star power. On Friday night he is staging a big rally in West Chester, Ohio that will pack in almost 100 senior Republican politicians including former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice, former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, governors Rick Perry and Bobby Jindal, and the golfer Jack Nicklaus.</p> <p>In a packed schedule he will vist, on top of Ohio, New Hampshire, Iowa and Colorado on Saturday, Iowa, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia on Sunday and Florida, Virginia and Ohio on Monday. He will end his campaign in Manchester, New Hampshire, on Monday night.</p> <p>Both the Obama and Romney camps publicly expressed confidence that they will win on Tuesday.</p> <p>Henry Barbour, one of the rising stars of the next generation of Republicans, expressed \"cautious optimism\" on Friday. Barbour is leading a group of 50 Republican volunteers from his native Mississippi to campaign in Florida.</p> <p>One of the reasons for his optimism was what he described as \"voter intensity\": people on the doorsteps who said they will definitely go out to vote for Romney on Tuesday.</p> <p>\"I think Sandy clearly froze the race. It gave the president a chance to have photo opportunities in New Jersey,\" Barbour said.</p> <p>Bob Haus, a Republican strategist in Iowa, predicted a last-minute surge for Romney. \"I think Iowa and other states will go down to the last voter,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>This time next week, we'll know. I hesitate to say we'll know by Wednesday morning: any journalist who covered the Bush v Gore Florida photo-finish of 2000 knows better than to tempt fate. But, barring a repeat of that freak event, it should be clear enough soon enough.</p> <p>Now is the moment the two duelling campaigns contemplate their destiny. What if Mitt Romney loses, as most of the blue-chip polling analysis says he will? It'll be a bitter personal defeat for a man who has been plotting this campaign since the moment his last one ended in failure. Seven days after he dropped out of the Republican primary race of 2008, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/30/us/politics/setback-leads-mitt-romney-to-reinvention.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" title=\"\">Romney gathered his allies around a boardroom table</a>, handing out a single-page memo he'd written about himself, detachedly laying out his own strengths and weaknesses and plotting the path to 2012.</p> <p>Some will say he has been running much longer, the ambition rooted in the crushing of his father's presidential hopes in 1968. Now Mitt Romney will be twice defeated with no chance of coming back. The stellar career in high finance that beckoned four years ago will surely beckon again \u2013 and this time with no nosy reporters demanding to know how much he pays in tax. (<a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2012/09/21/pf/taxes/romney-tax-return/index.html\" title=\"\">14%</a>, since you ask.)</p> <p>But the consequences of a Romney defeat would go much wider than the job prospects of one supremely wealthy man. The Republican party would have to stare itself long and hard in the face. A loss on Tuesday would mean the party had won the popular vote only once since 1988, when George W Bush beat John Kerry in 2004. In the five other elections, the Democrats would have beaten them. That is a shocking record that lays bare a deep, structural problem.</p> <p>Its base is shrinking before its eyes. The old \"southern strategy\" pioneered with such success by Richard Nixon, in which Republicans commandeered the white vote, often by playing on racial anxieties, worked wonders for decades. But now that white vote accounts for too small a share of the electorate: Romney is on course to win about 60% of it, but it's still not enough. <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-republican-convention-emphasizes-diversity-racial-incidents-intrude/2012/08/29/b9023a52-f1ec-11e1-892d-bc92fee603a7_story.html\" title=\"\">As the Republican senator Lindsey Graham so memorably</a> put it: \"The demographics race we're losing badly. We're not generating enough angry white guys to stay in business for the long term.\"</p> <p>The problem is that Republicans have not compensated for that decline in white numbers with gains elsewhere. Steve Schmidt, campaign manager for John McCain in 2008, put it starkly when we met: \"We have been horrific\" towards Hispanic-Americans, he said, adding that the party needed to start speaking to that rising population with \"respect\". George W Bush made an effort in that direction with some results, but any progress has been reversed this time. Obama is expected to win as much as <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-race-polarized-electorate-20121031,0,2198469.story\" title=\"\">75% of the Hispanic vote</a>.</p> <p>That problem with minorities \u2013 and one poll showed Romney's black support at <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/21/mitt-romney-black-vote_n_1820329.html\" title=\"\">a striking 0%</a> \u2013 is both cause and effect of its shrinking base. If only \"angry white guys\", or Tea Partiers and evangelical Christians, are taking part in presidential primaries, that is bound to have a distorting effect. Romney is a case in point. In theory, he could have been a candidate with crossover appeal: a moderate, proven businessman who had won in Democratic Massachusetts. But to win the Republican nomination he had to change, becoming what he called a \"severe conservative\", dropping his previous stances in favour of abortion rights and gun control and, in order not to be outflanked on his right, telling undocumented immigrants, most Hispanic, to \"self-deport\".</p> <p>This is the Republicans' existential problem. They have retreated ever deeper into an ideological laager, shaped by a narrow, nationally unrepresentative Christian right, until they have reached the point where anyone acceptable to them is unacceptable to the rest of the country. Romney was the only plausible candidate on offer from the freakshow they had to choose from \u2013 but competing in the freakshow turned him into someone implausible.</p> <p>If Romney loses on Tuesday, Republicans will have to acknowledge that they threw away an election that, by rights, should have been theirs. They faced an incumbent with low approval ratings and weighed down by an unemployment rate hovering around 8%: no US president since Franklin Roosevelt had been re-elected with such a high jobless number. This was their election to lose. If they lose it, they will need to contemplate the most profound change.</p> <p>And what if the polls in the critical swing states don't hold up and Obama loses? The brutal truth is that neither American politics nor history looks kindly on one-term presidents. They&#xa0;are instantly deemed failures. Jimmy Carter had to undertake a 30-year penance of good works in order to rehabilitate his reputation and absolve the grave sin of losing. Many Democrats would be similarly embarrassed by a defeated Obama, unsentimentally branding him a non-person. Many will say the party made a grave mistake and that it should have gone for Hillary in 2008, a view that will be nourished by this week's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/02/hillary-clinton-mitt-romney-poll\" title=\"\">YouGov poll finding that Clinton would have beaten Romney</a> by a comfortable six points.</p> <p>The last four years will be regarded as an aberration, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/charles-krauthammer-the-choice/2012/11/01/59b5bed0-2445-11e2-9313-3c7f59038d93_story.html\" title=\"\">\"a historical parenthesis, a passing interlude of overreaching hyper-liberalism, rejected by a center-right country that is 80% nonliberal,\"</a> according to the ultra-conservative commentator, Charles Krauthammer. Everything Obama did \u2013 his Keynesian stimulus, his bailout of the car industry, his reform of healthcare \u2013 will be condemned as a mistake, including by many Democrats who will succumb to the right's critique and fault Obama for veering too far left. Only the killing of Osama bin Laden will earn him any credit.</p> <p>Worse, and this will rarely be articulated out loud, too many Americans will see the first black presidency as a kind of failed experiment: we tried it, but it didn't work out. In a silent way, the bar for non-white candidates, already so high, will be even higher.</p> <p>The world outside America is backing Obama, the polls show it, but without the fervour of four years ago. Some on the left see little difference between him and Romney, on, say, drones, civil liberties or the Middle East; the odd nuance, perhaps, but otherwise they are&#xa0;Tweedledum and Tweedledee.</p> <p>Big mistake. Some of us heard the same refrain in 2000: no difference between Gore and Bush, who cares who wins? And we all know how that worked out.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/j_freedland\" title=\"\"><em>@j_freedland</em></a></p>",
  "<p>\u2022\u2009One curious sideshow of this campaign has been the war waged by certain pundits \u2013 whose job is to predict the election based on gut feelings \u2013 against those who prefer to use maths. In the gut instinct world of cable news, the race is neck-and-neck \u2013 a state of affairs that, coincidentally enough, fuels a demand for further gut-based punditry. For statisticians such as the <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/\" title=\"\">New York Times' Nate Silver, </a>meanwhile, the steadiness of Barack Obama's slight lead in crucial states makes a Romney victory, though far from impossible, fairly unlikely. What explains this disagreement? Pundit after right-wing pundit insists it must be Silver et al's dodgy numbers. (\"It's hard to blame conservatives for wondering if he might be working the refs,\" muttered <a href=\"[http://dailycaller.com/2012/10/19/nate-silver-vs-the-world/\" title=\"\">the Daily Caller's Matt Lewis</a>, seemingly unaware that Silver just plugs publicly available polling numbers, day after day, into the same unchanging computer model.) Now, in these last days of the race, other \"better than maths\" theories are emerging. Do you realise, asks the influential conservative site Breitbart.com, that Republicans <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/10/30/The-Streak-Republicans-Have-Won-Every-November-6th-Presidential-Election-Since-1860\" title=\"\">have won every election held on November 6 since 1860</a>? (That's true enough, but you can find patterns to prove anything: the mens' grooming website Grooming Lounge has shown that <a href=\"http://www.groomingguys.com/grooming-tips/the-presidential-eyebrow-index-super-graphic/\" title=\"\">the candidate with the better-kempt eyebrows usually triumphs</a>, which favours Obama.) But there's encouragement for Romney from New Jersey, where <a href=\"http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/politics/stories/animals-predict-a-win-for-romney\" title=\"\">a cockroach named Mitt beat a cockroach named Obama</a> in the New Jersey Pest Management Association's traditional election-season Running of the Roaches. The NJPMA boasts an 84% success rate \u2013 so what do you make of <em>that</em>, fancy \"statistician\" types? The cockroach named Nate Silver, one assumes, just sat in the corner, weeping quietly for his country.</p> <p>\u2022\u2009<a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/errant-gingrich-email-obama-going-win-174518235.html\" title=\"\">An email arrives</a> from zoo-loving space-colony enthusiast Newt Gingrich \u2013 or, to be precise, from an advertiser who has apparently paid real American dollars for access to his mailing list, Gingrich Marketplace. \"The truth is, the next election has already been decided. Obama is going to win,\" it begins. That's quite a concession from the camp of a prominent Republican. What's the argument? \"It's nearly impossible to beat an incumbent president.\" Well, no, but do go on: \"What's actually at stake right now is whether or not he will have a third term.\" Woah, what? That's right: according to <a href=\"http://pro.stansberryresearch.com/1210THIRDLIA/LPSINA33/\" title=\"\">an astonishingly long-winded audio presentation</a> linked from the email \u2013 which robbed your diarist, a human with a finite lifespan, of a quarter-hour he'll never get back \u2013 \"an enormous economic force\" will turn Obama into an idol, permitting him to rewrite the Constitution. A disclaimer explains that these wacky views aren't necessarily Newt's own, and to be fair, he's probably far too busy finalising blueprints for his nuclear-powered moon zoo to pay attention to what goes out under his name. Don't mock: once Obama installs himself as world dictator, you'll be grateful for Gingrich's outpost in space. Especially if you like zoos.</p> <p>\u2022\u2009There's bad news for a mainstay of campaign journalism in <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/ombudsman/2012/11/01/164107070/election-coverage-2-to-kill-the-man-on-the-street\" title=\"\">the findings of an audience research project</a> conducted by National Public Radio. Listeners generally admire NPR's coverage, it finds, but they can't abide those man- or woman-in-the-street interviews with voters. It's traditional to supplement discussion of candidates and policies with \"vox pops\", but as one respondent put it: \"I really don't care what some random dude in Florida thinks.\" \"Nothing is more frustrating for me,\" adds another, \"than hearing/reading/seeing know-nothing voters expose their utter ignorance.\" NPR's ombudsman says he partly concurs. But not everyone does. \"I quite like quotes from random people that add nothing substantive,\" said Betty Adams, a 32-year-old from Adelphi, Ohio, who works at a factory making teleportation devices. \"Also, it offers an easy way for journalists to conclude their articles.\"</p>",
  "<p>What is it like for Americans to watch the US election from Britain? Two US citizens, comedian Rich Fulcher and literature professor Sarah Churchwell, discuss media coverage, distance \u2013 and&#xa0;how to explain to Brits why the Republicans are a serious threat. Emine&#xa0;Saner listens in.</p> <p><strong>Rich Fulcher: </strong>Over here, I still see how pro-Obama everyone is. Some seem incredulous that it's even a close race.</p> <p><strong>Sarah Churchwell: </strong>There's a presumption that Americans are uninformed yahoos. The suspicion is that if they don't like Obama, it's because they're yahoos, not because they have arrived at&#xa0;that decision for rational reasons.</p> <p><strong>RF:</strong> Or they're from the south, or carry&#xa0;guns.</p> <p><strong>SC:</strong> Or they're evangelicals. Also, there doesn't seem to be any notion that you can object to Obama from the left \u2013 he's extended Bush's foreign policy, not shut Guant\u00e1namo, abrogated civil liberties \u2013 there are many ways one could object to him, and it doesn't make one Sarah Palin.</p> <p><strong>RF:</strong> Ultimately it boils down to whether you want Romney or Obama, despite Guant\u00e1namo. It's the lesser of two evils. Also, people here don't understand the electoral college. But who does? People here think swing states are where they have those parties with the car keys.</p> <p><strong>SC:</strong> There is this idea that the electoral divide is coastal, and it's east and west coast versus the heartland, and it's not. I&#xa0;think it's rural versus urban, and that's what people outside America don't understand. Obama's decision to bail out the auto industry has affected the midwest and bought him a lot of votes that were otherwise going to be dubious.</p> <p><strong>RF:</strong> And now Romney is claiming he has the same plan. He's like a little kid: \"No,&#xa0;that was my plan too!\"</p> <p><strong>SC:</strong> I'm pretty sure he wrote an editorial that said to let them go bankrupt, that this is the moral hazard of capitalism.</p> <p><strong>Emine Saner: </strong>Do you think Europeans are bewildered by the popularity of the Republican party? I couldn't imagine them existing here in any serious way.</p> <p><strong>RF:</strong> David Cameron couldn't exist in the Republican party, he's much too liberal.</p> <p><strong>SC:</strong> Nobody really knows what Romney thinks, but his record in Massachusetts is pretty moderate. He takes a lot of credit he doesn't deserve by saying he worked across the aisle with Democrats \u2013 but that's because 87% of his senate was Democrat, so he didn't really have a choice. It's hard to say what he would do if he were operating in a vacuum. The way the Republican party is currently working is by mobilising their base, which seems to me to be bonkers, because the birthers are never going to&#xa0;vote for Obama. Romney does not have to pander to them, he has to win the centre. I think it's a little unfair of Europeans who say it wouldn't happen here or in Europe \u2013 Le Pen exists in France, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/oct/26/golden-dawn-greece-police-video\" title=\"\">Golden Dawn</a> exists in Greece. In America, they have a slightly different face, but the story is the same: anti-immigrant, ideologically extreme, religiously or politically.</p> <p><strong>RF:</strong> In the Republican primaries you ask the question, \"How many of you believe in Darwinism?\" and nobody raises their hands. Romney may be moderate but he's carrying with him a bandwagon of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/30/donald-trump-birther-mitt-romney\" title=\"\">birthers</a> and extremists. Look at the way he stood up for [Republican Richard] Mourdock, who said it was God's will if you have a baby after being raped.</p> <p><strong>SC:</strong> So many people do not love Obama any more. Republican strategists seem not to understand that to swing that far right they're alienating people who would be willing to vote against Obama. People say to me here: \"It seems clear from Obama's many failures that one person's power to change the country is limited, so how much does it matter?\" It&#xa0;matters a lot, not least because of the supreme court, which is going to have between one and four vacancies in the&#xa0;next election cycle, and certainly within the next eight years. Some of the decisions they have made have not just been unconscionable to liberals, but have been historically unprecedented \u2013 absolutely out of the bounds of what the&#xa0;constitution gave them the powers to do. The consequences of having Romney in power, who will need to appease his Republican base by appointing a conservative court, is terrifying, because that's not just eight years, that's a generation.</p> <p><strong>RF:</strong> It's a great job, by the way. You get to sit down all the time.</p> <p><strong>SC:</strong> Really cool robes. To go back to the point about how the British view it, I&#xa0;have had more than one person say to me that it's entertainment, or theatre, which you feel sort of immune to.</p> <p><strong>RF:</strong> We look at politics now like sports \u2013 it's like, \"This guy got benched.\"</p> <p><strong>SC:</strong> I love entertainment, but the difference between something that has real consequences and something that doesn't is genuine. There are polls showing we haven't been as polarised as this since the civil war, and you know who I blame? Rupert Murdoch. In 1987, Reagan abolished the Fairness Doctrine, and in 1988 Murdoch started Fox News, and it was made legal because they no longer had to have balanced viewpoints. In the UK, that rule you still have here about balance. Some people might think is a bit tedious, I would say: \"Get rid of it and then you get Fox News.\"</p> <p><strong>RF:</strong> My parents are sucked into the Fox News bubble and they will never leave it. They're trying to get out, and I try to open the door for them, but it doesn't work. It's a right-wing prism. In the second presidential debate, Obama did very well \u2013 but not to them.</p> <p><strong>SC:</strong> What's hard to explain is why it feels&#xa0;like a civil war sometimes. I cannot talk about politics with one of my best friends because she is that kind of kneejerk Republican, and she thinks I'm&#xa0;a kneejerk liberal. I keep saying I&#xa0;would vote Republican if there were a Republican who was going to be good for the country, be moderate, protect reproductive rights. I'm socially liberal, but fiscally conservative, and that's not an unusual thing to find in America.</p> <p><strong>ES:</strong> Does the US election make you homesick?</p> <p><strong>SC:</strong> Homesickness comes up with Halloween and Christmas. I don't want to watch [the election] there; I think I&#xa0;would be more disheartened than I am.</p> <p><strong>ES:</strong> You've both lived here for several years. Do you feel people have been warmer to you as Americans during Obama's presidency? Can you imagine that changing?</p> <p><strong>SC:</strong> I've certainly encountered a lot less anti-Americanism than when Bush was in power. Not long after they invaded Iraq, I was in a bar with a friend and some&#xa0;guy kept pushing into us. I&#xa0;turned and politely asked him to give us some space and he said: \"Why don't you fuck off back to America?\"</p> <p><strong>RF:</strong> When Bush was president, I was \"Canadian\". It solved a lot of problems. If Romney wins I'm going to have to be Antarctican.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.sohotheatre.com/whats-on/rich-fulchers-special-u-s-election-show/\" title=\"\"><em>Rich Fulcher's Special US Election Show</em></a><em> featuring Scott Capurro and Hadley Freeman is at Soho theatre, London W1, on 5 November at 7.30pm. </em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 4 November 2012 to correct the spelling of Sarah Churchwell's name in the picture caption.

  "<p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/02/112263-stephen-king-review\" title=\"\">Stephen King's remarkable time-travel novel 11.22.63</a>, the central character, Jake, journeys back from the America of 2011 to the America of the early 1960s. While he is there, a woman challenges him to tell her one good thing about the future. \"I'll give you two for the price of one,\" Jake eventually replies. \"The cold war is over and the president is a black man.\" The woman's jaw drops. \"You're serious?\" she stammers in disbelief. \"Yes, I am,\" Jake replies. The woman ponders this almost inconceivable news from the future. Finally she asks, very haltingly: \"Is he \u2026 doing a good job?\" Jake explains that opinions of the president vary but, \"If you want mine, he's doing as well as anyone could expect, given the complexities.\"</p> <p>Mr King has surely got <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barack-obama\" title=\"\">Barack Obama's</a> first term about right. The record is certainly not perfect, but he has done about as well as anyone could reasonably expect, given that the economy has been in decline, the banks in crisis, America at war and the Republican party out to destroy him. Leading America through and out of such crises would be a formidable set of challenges at the best of times, but they have been made infinitely more difficult by the Republicans' single-minded commitment to eviscerating the Obama presidency. At a time when the economic role of government has been more important than at any time in a generation, the Republicans have been set on blocking, subverting and dismantling just about every programme that Mr Obama has promoted. In many cases they have succeeded. It is to Mr Obama's credit that he has achieved what he has \u2013 most notably the historic reform of healthcare and the economic stimulus package of 2009, their genuine imperfections rightly overshadowed by the substance of what they contained in spite of congressional resistance. And since the Republican recapture of Congress in 2010, US politics has been dominated by people who do not just despise Mr Obama, but by people who also despise government itself.</p> <p>The election of 2012 was never going to be a repeat of the election of 2008. Four years ago, Americans had the opportunity to repudiate the Bush years \u2013 so uniquely calamitous both at home and abroad \u2013 and to make a historic choice by electing Mr Obama. Even four years ago, never mind when seen from the <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wnet/jimcrow/\" title=\"\">Jim Crow</a> era, the 2008 contest was a jaw-dropping, almost redemptive, American moment. Expectations were incredibly high. Even in the best of times, it would have been hard to fulfil them. Mr Obama has fallen short of some important goals. Guant\u00e1namo Bay remains open. The Middle East peace process has got nowhere. Progress on climate change, though not negligible, has been slow. The Iraq war is over and torture has been ended, but the conflict in Afghanistan continues, waged increasingly through drone attacks that solve neither military nor political problems.</p> <p>Four years later, the 2012 contest may lack the glamour of 2008. But it is in every way at least as important. Partly, that is because of what a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/mittromney\" title=\"\">Mitt Romney</a> victory on Tuesday might mean \u2013 the destruction of welfare safety nets, a free pass for the tax-avoiding rich, indifference to the environment, the dismantling of healthcare, reactionary moves on women's and gay rights, and the chance to stuff the supreme court even more solidly with justices of the anti-government right. More than that, however, it is because the re-election of Mr Obama would be an act of collective national seriousness by Americans who believe in good government not no government and who possess a concern for community that goes beyond material self-interest.

This is his last election, he's really energised.\"</p> <p>And so he was. I haven't heard Obama as fired up at a rally like this one since 2008. In the events I've seen him at this year he's always been 10% reserved, 20% professorial. A pale reflection of the \"hope and change\" merchant of four years ago. But this time he was back to the firebrand of 08, his speech belching out of him like it came from the gut.</p> <p>I know it's become unfashionable to talk about Obama the orator \u2013 he over did it with the promises and the rhetoric four years ago and to no small extent he's been paying the price ever since. But when he turns it on, it still sends electricity through the crowd, and it did here.</p> <p>The anger towards Romney was palpable. \"The folks at the top in this country don't need another champion in Washington. They already have a seat at the table,\" he said. Romney didn't represent change, or the future. \"To make sure no matter who you are or where you come from you can make it in America, that's the future.\"</p> <p>It is stating the obvious that Obama's supporters in the crowd loved him. But actually, at this late stage in the election, that is of huge importance. His mission here was to fire up the base so that they get out this weekend knocking on doors and getting out the vote. With poll margins razor-thin in Ohio, the candidate that has the edge in inspiring his faithful followers over the next four days in this crucial battleground state is likely to be the next occupant of the White House.</p> <p>So it matters that Pam Bishop, 60, looked at the end of Obama's speech as though she'd just seen an angel, and vowed to work hard from now to the end of election day. \"I think he is amazing. I think he gets what the country needs and he's willing to work for every single one of us.\"</p> <p>And it particularly mattered that Rick McCurdy, 59, said he found the speech \"very motivating\". McCurdy is one of the one in eight Ohioans who work in the auto industry, in his case for Honda US, and he says without the auto bailout he might have lost his job. \"I'm not ready to go backwards,\" he said, echoing one of Obama's mantras. \"I want to see him moving forwards with the recovery.\"</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-02T17:04:45.923Z\">at 5.04pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5093e897b579f74bac764970\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-02T15:36:55.379Z\">3.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Mitt Romney</strong> appears to be doing his greatest hits here in West Allis, but the latest jobs figures don't get much attention from Romney:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Unemployment is higher today than the day Barack Obama took office.</p> </blockquote> <p>Yes, that is technically true, given that the January 2009 jobs report had 7.8% unemployment, and Obama was inaugurated on 20 January.</p> <p>And here we go with the five-point plan to create jobs.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-02T15:42:59.996Z\">at 3.42pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5093e753b579f74bac76496f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-02T15:31:31.175Z\">3.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">MItt Romney speaks in Wisconsin</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Now <strong>Mitt Romney</strong> takes the stage in <strong>Wisconsin</strong>, and he also starts off by mentioning the impact of Sandy.

One of Romney\u2019s senior strategist set out the basics of the campaign, some of which turned out as planned, such as a strong debate performance.</p> <p>Crucial to the strategy were the unemployment figures in September, coming at the end of the Democratic convention, and again in October. But these figures today were to have been the killer, with just four full days of campaigning left.</p> <p>It has not worked out like that, mainly because the figures have gone down, dropping below the symbolically-important 8%. It is not just that the figures have gone down but that voters have not attached as much importance to them as the Romney campaign had hoped. Americans have been living with unemployment for four years: it is a fact of life, and the monthly unemployment figures have been largely discounted.</p> <p>These figures are good for the Obama campaign, the 171,000 new jobs higher than expected. The Obama campaign can claim that the trend is going in the right direction.</p> <p>The Romney campaign is almost certain to say that the unemployment rate is still too high, that the rate is not coming down fast enough, that all that stimulus money has failed to make an impact. But these figures are not the game-changer the Romney campaign had predicted two months ago.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5093c3cfb579f74bac764956\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-02T13:00:00.104Z\">1.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On the point about the <strong>unemployment rate</strong> at the start and end of Barack Obama's first presidential term:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/damianpaletta/status/264349507238633472\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Obama trying to join Reagan and GW Bush; won reelection with unemployment higher than day took office.

Similarly, a total below that will suggest the opposite, especially if the new jobs total dips below 100,000.</p> <h2><strong>2. Will the unemployment rate stay at 7.8%?</strong></h2> <p>Even a slight uptick in the headline rate of unemployment will become ammunition for the Romney campaign \u2013 all the more if the rate goes to 8% or above.</p> <h2><strong>3. Will revisions to previous months add or subtract?</strong></h2> <p>September's positive jobs report may be subject to heavy revision, possibly raising the unemployment rate in retrospect. Look out for revisions to previous months.</p> <h2><strong>4. What about the numbers below the headline figures?</strong></h2> <p>After the job creation total and unemployment rate, the report includes a wealth of other data. The key statistics include hours worked and hourly pay: strong increases in both are signs of an improving labour market, and a better guide to how those in work are faring.</p> <h2><strong>5. What will be the impact from Hurricane Sandy?</strong></h2> <p>The storm's devastation may have come too late in the month to have much impact on October's jobs numbers. But its influence, if any, is likely to be negative, as well as a possible source of confusion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-957d65a3-fac3-4146-b624-6d4496d331fd\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/online/2012/10/31/1351690402591/Downed-power-lines-after--007.jpg\" alt=\"Downed power lines after superstorm Sandy at Seaside Heights island\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Downed power lines at Seaside Heights, New Jersey.

  "<p>Hillary Clinton would be on course for a landslide victory over Mitt Romney, with a lead five points larger than Barack Obama's, if she was on the ballot paper instead of the president in Tuesday's US election, according to a poll.</p> <p><a href=\"http://image.theguardian.com/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2012/11/02/ClintonvObamamk2.pdf\" title=\"YouGov survey\">The survey by YouGov (pdf)</a>, shown exclusively to the Guardian, has the secretary of state beating Romney by 51% to 45% among likely voters. Obama leads Romney by 48% to 47%.</p> <p>YouGov estimates that Clinton's lead would translate into a massive victory in the electoral college, by 347 to 191 votes. The polling company, which surveys regularly in the US, believes Clinton would win both Florida and North Carolina, states that it projects Obama to lose.</p> <p>The findings are likely to add to the clamour for Clinton to seek the presidency in 2016, when she would be the frontrunner for her party's nomination.</p> <p>Many Obama supporters will not be too rattled by the survey. For one thing, hypothetical candidates tend to do better than actual ones, especially incumbents. Obama is saddled by the baggage of four years in the White House; Clinton is relatively untarnished by comparison.</p> <p>Secretaries of state are often more popular than the presidents they serve, as both Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice discovered. They enjoy the prestige of high office but have to make no unpopular domestic decisions and bear no responsibility or blame for the economy.</p> <p>Still, the poll shows Clinton performing more strongly than Obama among almost every group: men and women, Republicans and independents, those earning less than $40,000 a year and those earning more. Among white voters the president trails Romney by 21 points; Clinton would cut that advantage to 14 points.</p> <p>Only among African Americans does Clinton enjoy less support than Obama: she would beat Romney among black voters by 89% to 10%, while Obama beats the Republican even more thoroughly, by 91% to 5%.</p> <p>\"The key thing is that Hillary can reach certain white demographics far better than Obama, and this is only partly offset by Obama's appeal among black voters,\" said YouGov's president, Peter Kellner.</p> <p>That finding revives a claim made often during the 2008 primary contest between Obama and Clinton, when the former first lady enjoyed an advantage with white, low-income Democratic voters in blue-collar states where Obama struggled.</p> <p>Longtime Clinton supporters will be delighted at the remarkable distance the former first lady has travelled in the 20 years since her husband was first elected to the White House. Back then she was a polarising figure; a 1990s bumper sticker declared \"Life's a Hillary\". Now she may well be the most popular politician in the US.</p> <p>\u2022 YouGov questioned a representative sample of 1,000 US adults online between 27-29 October. The sample was stratified by age, gender, race, education, and region. The raw data was then weighted to match the profile of registered voters by age, gender, race, education, news interest and ideology.</p>",
  "<p>Britain, the US and other western powers are backing a new attempt to create a single coherent Syrian opposition that could take part in peace talks with President Bashar al-Assad's regime or, if talks fail, provide a channel for greater military support to the rebels.</p> <p>The plan, to be launched in Doha, Qatar, on Thursday, will bring the external opposition together with the revolutionary councils leading the insurrection inside Syria, behind a common programme for a democratic transition. The <a href=\"http://carnegie-mec.org/publications/?fa=49872\" title=\"\">Syrian National Initiative</a> (SNI) will create a council of about 50 members chaired by Riad Seif, a Sunni businessman who left Syria in June after being imprisoned by the regime.</p> <p>The Doha initiative has been organised by the Qatari government and has drawn support from the US, Britain and France. Russia, however, opposes the plan, arguing it reneges on <a href=\"http://www.unog.ch/80256EDD006B9C2E/%28httpNewsByYear_en%29/18F70DBC923963B1C1257A2D0060696B?OpenDocument\" title=\"\">an earlier international agreement</a> to pursue the formation of a new government by \"mutual consent\" of the parties to the conflict. The leadership of the main exile opposition group, the Syrian National Council (SNC), has also criticised the plan, in which its influence will be diluted, and it is not yet clear which of the divided rebel forces inside Syria will turn up on Thursday, or whether they will agree on the common platform once they arrive in Doha.</p> <p>\"It could go as promised, or it could be a train wreck,\" said Salman Shaikh, the head of the Brookings Institution Doha Centre, which had helped arrange earlier opposition discussions that paved the way for the Doha meeting. <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2012/10/18-losing-syria-shaikh\" title=\"\">Shaikh has argued that Syria's collapse as a nation state</a> can only be avoided by unification of the rebels coupled with \"a unified, controlled flow of weapons and other support to the Syrian opposition\" to prevent a power vacuum and a \"free for all\".</p> <p>The US and its western European allies have so far avoided supplying weapons to the rebels, although US intelligence appears to have played a role in trying to control the flow of arms coming from Qatar and other Gulf opponents of the Assad regime. Observers say that if the Doha initiative is successful, Washington's policy might change, allowing heavier weapons to be supplied to the opposition, whoever wins the US election on Tuesday.</p> <p>A western official insisted on Friday that the primary goal of a unified opposition would be to engage in peace talks with the regime about a transition, and so the Doha plan was a way of implementing the <a href=\"http://www.unog.ch/80256EDD006B9C2E/%28httpNewsByYear_en%29/18F70DBC923963B1C1257A2D0060696B?OpenDocument\" title=\"\">June Geneva agreement</a>, rather than a substitute for it, as Moscow had alleged.</p> <p>The risks that have so far prevented direct western intervention were made clear on Friday with <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=20422\" title=\"\">the emergence of a video</a> apparently showing the execution of captured government soldiers in Idlib province. A rebel fighter from the province, Abu Abdul Rahiem, said the killings took place in al-Nayrab to the west of Saraqeb, on the highway between Aleppo and Damascus, which the rebel Free Syrian Army (FSA) claimed to have captured on Friday. He claimed the executions were carried out by a Salafist extremist group, operating outside the command structure of the FSA.</p> <p>\"Assad's soldiers were inside a military camp in the town. Fighters from the Salafi Dawood brigade overran the camp and captured the soldiers. Initially there were only 10 of them so they could not take the soldiers captive, and had to kill them immediately. No trial could be held because the fighting was still going on. This is guerrilla warfare,\" Rahiem told the Guardian.</p> <p>\"We do not wish to turn Syria into another Afghanistan, but we can't stop these extremists groups. We are really worried about the future of Syria. We need weapons and media support, but there is nothing on the ground.\"</p> <p>Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the UN human rights council, said the video still had to be verified, but added: \"The allegations are that these these were soldiers who were no longer combatants. And therefore, at this point it looks very likely that this is a war crime, another one.\"</p> <p>Washington's decision to swing its support behind the Doha initiative marked a decisive break with the SNC after months of mounting frustration over the exile group's failure to unite the internal and external opposition.</p> <p>\"We've made it clear that the SNC can no longer be viewed as the visible leader of the opposition,\" the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, said on Wednesday. \"They can be part of a larger opposition, but that opposition must include people from inside Syria and others who have a legitimate voice that needs to be heard.\"</p> <p>SNC leaders dismissed the Doha plan. The group <a href=\"http://www.france24.com/en/20121102-syrias-snc-accuses-us-undermining-revolution\" title=\"\">issued a statement</a> saying that any attempt to create new bodies to replace the SNC \"are an attempt to undermine the Syria revolution by sowing the seeds of division\".</p> <p>The SNC will hold a congress of its own starting on Saturday in Doha, aimed at restructuring the organisation and electing a new leadership. That new leadership will have to decide by Thursday whether to take up about 15 seats on the 50-member SNI council which have been reserved for it.</p> <p>\"The SNC has not been able to provide a broad-based platform,\" Shaikh said. \"They've been asked to cut themselves down to size. Fifteen seats would still leave them the biggest single group by far. Most other groups will be represented by just one person.\"</p> <p>A western official said: \"It is important for the SNC to know that there will be very little tolerance for them if they try to play the spoilers at the Thursday meeting.\"</p> <p>The official said that the Qatar government had made great efforts to ensure that the internal opposition, including the revolutionary councils, would take part in the meeting. Western observers are also due to attend, including the British envoy to the Syrian opposition, John Wilkes, but have not played a central role in the organisation.</p> <p>\"The Qataris have played their cards close to their chest and its not clear they want the same things as us,\" the western official said.</p>",
  "<p>\"Right \u2026 No, no, 'votefromabroad' is all run together. Then a dot. Then org.\"</p> <p>In the Great Portland Street office of Democrats Abroad, men with perfect teeth are explaining how to vote to expats down the phoneline who apparently have never used the internet before.</p> <p>The atmosphere in the London offices is not exactly tense \u2013 it's not the White House situation room, after all \u2013 but nobody is in much mood to mess around.</p> <p>There are 6.3 million Americans living outside the US and in a close election like this one absentee ballots are a big deal. \"Where we can make a difference still, we will be doing everything we can to make a difference,\" Susan Schoenfeld Harrington explains. \"People are very fired up, they recognise how important an election this is. What's been happening in the past few days with hurricane Sandy has underlined the real differences between candidates, and what kind of government they believe in.\"</p> <p>I'm surprised by how much latitude there is in the deadlines \u2013 a lot of states will take an absentee ballot so long as it's postmarked 6 November, the big election day itself. Of the relevant states \u2013 there are only about seven with a real chance of swinging the result \u2013 Iowa, Colorado and Pennsylvania will still count your ballot paper if they get it the week after.</p> <p>Apart from sheer numbers, the other good reason \u2013 if you're a Democrat \u2013 to concentrate on Americans living abroad is that Mitt Romney has almost no support anywhere outside the US. Two <a href=\"http://normantranscript.com/community-news-network/x1095518407/How-the-world-would-vote-in-the-U-S-election\" title=\"\">rather mischievous polls</a> \u2013 one by the BBC and one by UPI \u2013 asked the world how it would vote in the US election. Only one country of 32 \u2013 Israel \u2013 would go Romney. There was a very slight preference (14% to 11%) for Romney over Obama in Pakistan, but against a background that most people thought either result totally catastrophic.</p> <p>One might reasonably suppose, given the untranslatability of the Romney charm, that US citizens living abroad might have a more cosmopolitan, Obama-friendly aspect.</p> <p>But in the Democrat campaign room, nobody but Susan is allowed to say what they think. It's a little bit more North Korea than North America.</p> <p>\"We can tell you colourful tales,\" says one campaign guy.</p> <p>\"Go on, then.\"</p> <p>\"But they have to be off the record. I'm from a red state anyway. I still have to go back there. If my full name got out and people could look me up online, that would make things really difficult for me. You could be openly Democratic in Austin, but nowhere else in Texas. You would never be openly agnostic or atheist in public. It can affect you in business, when you network \u2026\" \"Seriously?\" \"Well, look it up. Look up what happened to the guy in Florida. You don't need to hear this from me.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0912/80998.html\" title=\"\">Scott Van Duzer</a>, the owner of Big Apple pizza and pasta restaurant, enthusiastically hugged Barack Obama at the start of September, since which effervescent gesture he has had boycotts, threats, a flood of one-star ratings on Yelp (the US restaurant version of TripAdvisor) and the hurt of sarcastic reviews, like \"the problem is that if you order one, you have to share the pizza with everyone else in the restaurant\". Although that is quite droll, most of the attacks have been unfunny, with the vitriol of a very polarised debate.</p> <p>There is a growing consensus that the middle ground has disappeared, that people are approaching politics as they would sporting affiliations, avidly, unquestioningly and passionately (not necessarily in a nice way), and politicians play up to that, exaggerating their differences in public while cutting deals quite happily behind the scenes.</p> <p>It's not just the modern, post-Clinton, third-way strategising that's led to this, and not all the polarisation is pantomime. Politicians have been tapping racism for electoral advantage since the 70s. The so-called \"southern strategy\" set out to deliberately deter black people from voting Republican, so that white racists who might be Democrats otherwise would be irresistibly pulled rightwards by their desire to vote with other white people. Culturally, shock-jockery, segueing into Fox News infotainment, has punched out a lot of space on the far right.</p> <p>\"What are you writing down? You can't write that \u2026\" one man (anonymous, of indeterminate age) says, while we are talking about all this. \"I'm not writing that, I'm making a note about something else.\" \"What else?\" \"Well, obviously now I've forgotten.\"</p> <p>Perhaps all this ding-dong, black-white simplicity makes sense in central planning; on the ground, it makes for an atmosphere that is, while buoyant, quite paranoid.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama returned to the crucial battleground state of Ohio on Friday following his storm-induced break from campaigning, with a sharpened rhetoric as he scrambles for the finishing line now just four days away.</p> <p>In the first of three stops in Ohio on Friday, Obama poured scorn on Mitt Romney in front of a barn full of about 5,000 supporters in Hilliard outside the state capital Columbus.</p> <p>\"Governor Romney is a very talented salesman,\" he said. \"He has tried as hard as he can to repackage his old policies and offer them as change.\"</p> <p>Obama ridiculed Romney's recent attempt to cast himself as the candidate who would bring change to Washington, accusing him of misleading the American people. \"Trying to massage the facts, that ain't change, that's \u2026\"</p> <p>\"Lying!\" chanted the crowd obligingly.</p> <p>Obama made a particular bid to woo employees of the car industry who represent one in eight of the Ohio workforce. \"The American auto industry is back on top,\" he said, an allusion to the federal bailout that he authorised.</p> <p>He also referred to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/02/us-economy-171000-jobs-obama\">Friday's US employment figures</a> that showed 171,000 new jobs in October \u2013 an increase, Obama pointed out, greater \"than at any time in the last eight months\".</p> <p>Both presidential candidates are now going hell to leather for the Ohio vote. The reason is simple: taking the White House will be difficult without this state's 18 electoral votes out of the 270 needed to win. In Romney's case it is particularly urgent \u2013 no Republican president has attained the highest office without first winning this state.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/oh/ohio_romney_vs_obama-1860.html\">All recent polls, with the exception of Rasmussen</a>, put Obama in the lead in Ohio, but the advantage is in most cases within the margin of error which is why both presidential candidates will be running around the state in the sort of frenzy normally only seen in children's animations.</p> <p>Obama will be in Ohio on each of the final days of campaigning, in addition to dashes to Colorado, Florida, Iowa, New Hampshire, Virginia and Wisconsin. To add stardust to proceedings, he is dragging Stevie Wonder on stage with him on Sunday in Cincinnati, and Jay-Z and Bruce Springsteen in Columbus on Monday evening.</p> <p>Romney too is going for star power, in bucket loads. On Friday night he is staging a mega-rally in West Chester in west Ohio that will pack in almost 100 senior Republican politicians including former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice, former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, governors Rick Perry and Bobby Jindal, and for good measure the golfer Jack Nicklaus.</p> <p>The purpose of all this frenetic activity is not to persuade any undecided voters still standing. \"I don't know that there are any truly undecided voters right now \u2013 this race has been very polarising,\" said Joe McNamara, president of the city council of Toledo, a Democratic stronghold in north-west Ohio.</p> <p>The intention, rather, is to energise the Democratic and Republican base so that supporters get out and volunteer in the final three days. Obama made his bid to fire up the base at the Hilliard rally by painting his rival as a bastion of the greedy rich.</p> <p>\"The folks at the top in this country don't need another champion in Washington. They already have a seat at the table,\" he said.</p> <p>He warned the crowd that the Republicans were trying to wear the American electorate down so that they didn't bother to vote. \"In other words, Ohio, their bet is on cynicism. My bet is on you.\"</p> <p>As the presidential race turns to its ultimate stage \u2013 the all-important drive to get out the vote \u2013 Obama has an inbuilt head start. He has been campaigning in Ohio for 18 months, far longer than Romney who was distracted for months by the primary race, and on the ground has 130 offices spread throughout the state to his rival's 40.</p> <p>But doubts still remain that Obama will be able to enthuse his followers to the giddy heights that he achieved in 2008. Jim Messina, the Obama campaign manager, insists enthusiasm levels are equivalent to four years ago, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SGlWT0bIBs\">and he has also claimed</a> that the president has the upper edge in early voting in Ohio.</p> <p>But there are signs of weakness in some parts of the state. A politician in a key urban area where Democratic candidates traditionally do well told the Guardian that the Obama campaign was struggling to fill volunteer rotas. Phone banking was being switched to supporters in other states to free up bodies on the ground in Ohio, and volunteer canvassers are being bussed in this weekend <a href=\"https://my.barackobama.com/page/event/detail/gbhd3t\">from as far away as Brooklyn</a>.</p> <p>\"We have been genuinely surprised by the lack of enthusiasm we've found. The Obama ground game is going to be better than the Republicans', no doubt about that, but not by the degree it was four years ago,\" said the politician, who asked not to be named.</p> <p>The Romney campaign also claims to have its base fired up following the televised presidential debates last month. But on the Republican side it is unclear whether they have managed to build on that momentum and it remains to be seen whether they can convert it into extra votes.</p> <p>The truth is that as they hurtle up the home stretch, both campaigns are depending on the exceptional fortitude of their most loyal followers. Individuals such as Sheila Oxsher, who has turned up at her local campaign office in Columbus every day since mid-August to volunteer for Romney.</p> <p>She works up to 12 hours a day, seven days a week, and has so far logged 14,707 phone calls to potential Republican voters. \"This is my patriotic commitment \u2013 it's my equivalent of George Washington crossing the Delaware in 1776,\" she says.</p>",
  "<p>In some towns, visitors are warned to keep an eye on their stuff, or to watch out late at night. In the Californian city of Stockton, the anxiety is more precise \u2013 and it kicks in early. \"Take care downtown after 5pm,\" one local person told me. \"Don't hang out too long.\"</p> <p>A few hours later, I saw what she meant. Almost as soon as the offices shut, the city centre empties. Then the sun goes down and a different cast takes to the streets: the homeless, the drug dealers, and clusters of young men patrolling up and down on bicycles.</p> <p>Stockton ranks among America's 10 most dangerous cities, and everyone here seems to operate under a self-imposed curfew. The commuter admits she doesn't dare go to the cinema after 8pm; the father expects his 18-year-old daughter home by 10 \u2013 \"and she totally gets why.\" Others prefer not to go out at all. All give the same reason: the spiralling number of violent crimes.</p> <p>Last weekend, the city notched up its 60th murder of the year, up from 24 for all of 2008. At just under 300,000 residents, this river port has about the same population as a London borough. Imagine a couple of your neighbours getting killed every week, and you'll understand why almost all the conversations here touch on a recent homicide.</p> <p>It happened in this park, they tell you; outside that drive-through; on a first date. Then the inevitable coda: \"It happened in broad daylight.\"</p> <p>The last time Stockton attracted so much attention was in 2008, as the biggest housing bubble America had ever enjoyed was turning into the biggest bust it had ever suffered.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.realtytrac.com/content/news-and-opinion/2008-year-end-foreclosure-market-report-4621\" title=\"\">With nearly one in 10 homes repossessed that year alone</a>, the city became known as the foreclosure capital of the US and formed part of the backdrop of economic catastrophe against which Barack Obama was elected president.</p> <p>Then: nothing. For the next four years, the name barely cropped up in the news, so that you'd have been forgiven for believing the bad times had eased off. Until this summer, that is, when it became the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-18605326\" title=\"\">largest city in America to file for bankruptcy</a>. The bushfire had not died down, far from it \u2013 while the rest of the world was not looking, it had escalated.</p> <p>The two-and-a-half-hour drive there inland from San Francisco moves from coastal grooviness to municipal crack-up. You're told as much by the local TV news network, whose reports bear the strapline <a href=\"http://www.news10.net/news/stockton-in-crisis/default.aspx\" title=\"\">Stockton in Crisis</a>. Or you can infer it from the defensiveness of the signage. \"Stockton is Magnificent!\" reads one banner. \"Don't give up!!!\" says the <a href=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8038/8056740197_16c053d04d.jpg\" title=\"\">hoarding over empty shop fronts</a>.</p> <p>Apart from the odd grocery store and a giant wig emporium, what downtown Stockton has in abundance is abandoned shops.</p> <p>What makes the dereliction disconcerting is that it nestles amid civic grandeur, some of it quite recent. Stockton rivalled Seattle and San Francisco for importance as a transport hub during the gold rush on the 19th-century west coast, which must help to account for its grand boulevards, spacious enough to march elephants.</p> <p>But there are also marbled bank offices, refurbished theatres and government offices, none of which look more than a few years old.</p> <p>\"The downtown could have been like Paris's 6th arrondissement!\" local property developer Dan Cort tells me. While it sounds preposterous now, his claim underscores one thing: there can't be many cities in America unravelling as fast as this one.</p> <p>Yet it would be wrong to dismiss Stockton as a curio, an outlandish disaster that couldn't happen here, for three reasons. First, many other towns in California, a state of 40 million that on its own would count among the 10 biggest economies on earth, are scrambling to avoid bankruptcy. This tale shares elements of the debacles in Greece, Spain and Britain, too \u2013 almost as if all the factors behind the western meltdown had been chucked in a Walmart blender and poured over one small town. What's unfurling here sums up the distinctive, dangerous way in which the great slump is playing out. Extreme it may be, but Stockton's story is also one version of a future that awaits many other cities, including those in Britain.</p> <p>Let's begin with that last point. Most recessions follow a familiar waltz. First, there is the economic downturn, then there are the politicians' responses, before the social fallout: cause, effect, aftermath. But Stocktonians don't talk about a recession; they call it a depression. With one in eight workers out of a job, unemployment is almost double the national average. Six years after the peak of the market, house prices are still around half what they once were.</p> <p>The local council's cash used to come from property and sales taxes; when those dried up, it rammed through cuts: the police force was shrunk by 25%, the fire department slashed by 30%, libraries and community centres either closed or are on short hours. Finally, this summer, officials ran out of services to shut, and declared the city bust.</p> <p>As has happened in southern Europe, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/21/austerity-debate-editorial\" title=\"\">threatens to happen under David Cameron</a> too, this slump has been so severe and so prolonged that the economic, political and social crises are now overlapping, and amplifying each other.</p> <p>To see that play out, head to Weston Ranch, a southern suburb devastated by the sub-prime mortgage crisis. According<a href=\"http://meridian.aag.org/callforpapers/program/AbstractDetail.cfm?AbstractID=47692\" title=\"\"> to research by Maianna Voge at George Washington University</a>, almost one in three houses on some blocks suffered foreclosure in the bust.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/28/subprimecrisis.useconomy\" title=\"\">When a Guardian reporter last dropped by, in 2008</a>, he noted a forest of estate agents' boards and window signs: \"Bank-owned \u2013 no trespassing\". Four years on, there's much less of either. Buyers have since come along \u2013 but, rather than the families of old, they're often speculators, holding out for a blip in the market before offloading their auction bargains. While waiting, they rent the properties out carelessly and cheaply. Among these Frank Capra-esque homes, the signs of distress are now more subtle: cracked windows and lawns with overgrown brown grass.</p> <p>On this afternoon, the only activity is on one driveway with a removals van. Sure enough, the bank is foreclosing on Susan and her family in the morning. Within a few minutes it all comes out: how her father moved them all here from Fremont in San Francisco's Bay Area; how his ultra-low \"teaser rate\" mortgage repayments rocketed without warning. How, just as that happened, property prices plunged so that they were \"upside down\", with the house worth less than they'd paid for it. How the lender didn't return their calls. How her father was diagnosed with cancer. Finally: how he'd died at the start of this month, just as the new buyer, one of the investors taking over the area, had offered her $3,000 to return the keys and leave without smashing the place up.</p> <p>The story you're sometimes told about the sub-prime bubble is that it was a bunch of people who should never have been lent a dime suddenly being given the keys to the palace of debt. Wherever that applies, it isn't Weston Ranch. As Voge points out, household incomes here average between $60,000 and $80,000 a year: enough to warrant a middle class lifestyle, but insufficient to afford one in the pricey Bay Area. So, just as Susan's father did, they moved further and further out.</p> <p>\"At 4am, you'd see the house lights come on,\" is how another Weston Ranch resident, Alicia Calhoun, remembers life during the supposed good times. \"By 6am \u2013 click! \u2014 the garage doors would go up and the street would empty out.\" Calhoun worked in customer services for a bank in Palo Alto: at least a four-hour round trip, on top of the 9-5 job and looking after her kids.</p> <p>That commute, those dodgy mortgages, this entire \"bedroom community\" deep in the Central Valley: all were products of a country growing vastly more unequal within a generation. <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2010/wp10268.pdf\" title=\"\">According to IMF researchers Michael Kumhof and Romain Ranci\u00e8re</a>, by 2007 the richest 5% of Americans were pocketing 34 cents of every dollar earned in the US; a level of inequality last seen just before the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Most of the rest of the country saw negligible rises in their wages, and had to rely instead on borrowing. What followed was the crash of 2008 \u2013 and human and civic wreckage in places such as Stockton.</p> <p>In T-shirt and shorts, Susan's mood flits between volcanic and eve-of-holiday. \"You know how many homes here have been foreclosed? That one. That one. That one.\" She's jabbed her finger along almost the entire cul-de-sac. \"Only the family next door haven't. I give them six months.\"</p> <p>Weston Ranch, which is about 80% non-white, is basically Obamaville: full of the middle-class families he claims as his bedrock. But throughout the sub-prime freefall, his administration in effect delegated responsibility to local governments and market forces. And even in the last days of this campaign, neither Obama nor Mitt Romney has seriously addressed the housing crash. Yet according to the Chicago economist, Amir Sufi, <a href=\"http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/amir.sufi/research/profsufi_twitter_20121016.pdf\" title=\"\">the property bust and the recession have between them wiped out the 20 years' worth of savings</a> by middle-income and poor families.</p> <p>Susan's brother Dusty has been helping shift boxes. Another jabbing finger: \"He fought in Iraq and now he's back here and the only jobs around are in warehouses at $9 an hour.\" Breath. \"This economy is garbage.\"</p> <p>The rec where Susan used to stroll has got so violent it's been dubbed Bullet Park. And last summer, she says, about 60 teenagers got into a pitched battle on the grass in front of her house. \"They were going at each other with metal poles.\" Her husband phoned the police again and again, but they were too short-staffed to help. \"It went on for hours.\"</p> <p>When I run <a href=\"http://www.recordnet.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20120809%2FA_NEWS%2F208090318\" title=\"\">this story </a>by police sergeant Kathryn Nance, she is puzzled: \"We would have come out for an incident like that.\" Yet as we sit in her patrol car, she taps at the laptop: 6.30 on a Friday evening and there are already 27 outstanding calls for assistance. Top of the list is a rape reported an hour and a half ago, yet which no officer is free to deal with.</p> <p>Nance's officers pile into a run-down area to chase some warrants. It's a sweep that the accompanying local TV reporter seems ecstatic about filming, but which feels like a formulaic show of police strength; strength that the downsized force no longer has. A colleague, Mark, estimates there are promising leads on more than a dozen murder cases but no manpower to investigate them. Nance talks about how the cuts made by various council departments are making parts of Stockton into no-go areas. She drives past one block and sighs: \"There used to be parks and it was cleaned up. In the past four years it's gone bad again: dope dealers and vagrants.\". And hassling drug dealers has become an occasional pursuit</p> <p>If you don't want your area to go bad, you have to lay on your own services. On the \"miracle mile\", the boutiques spend their former marketing budget on a security patrol and street sweepers. They even maintain municipal car parks. A local hotelier pays to keep two public swimming pools open.</p> <p>Such a sudden, drastic downgrade in what Stocktonians can expect from their mortgage lender, their council, their police, their neighbours, not to mention their own homes and pensions is dizzying even for the well-off.</p> <p>As a developer of affordable housing, <a href=\"http://www.visionaryhomebuilders.org/about/ceo/\" title=\"\">Carol Ornelas</a> patiently talks me through what the sub-prime crisis means for her customers. Then she mentions her own situation \u2013 and the rush of words is like letting the air out of a balloon: \"I used to live in middle-class America; now I don't know where I live. What I've seen come into my neighbourhood after all the foreclosures ... I don't even want to be around it.\" Again, she talks of fights in the yard just opposite.</p> <p>Yet a quarter of an hour's drive from Nance's block-gone-bad is <a href=\"http://www.brooksidegolf.net/Club/Scripts/Home/home.asp\" title=\"\">Brookside</a>: an empty six-lane highway, a country club, and a string of small gated communities bearing such names as Nostalgia, where houses back on to fake lakes. Sneak inside and you see marble statues of cherubs. One clich\u00e9 about recessions is that they make rich and poor slightly more equal. Not this time:<a href=\"http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~saez/saez-UStopincomes-2010.pdf\" title=\"\"> according to Berkeley economist Emmanuel Saez</a>, the top 1% saw their incomes soar by 11.6% in 2010; the wages of the other 99% grew only 0.2%.</p> <p>\"The American dream used to be within reach of the middle class,\" says Ornelas. \"Now it's on offer only to an elite.\"</p> <p>Stockton's city hall bears an inscription: \"Let that which the fathers have builded inspire their sons to civic patriotism.\" Inside, the mayor's office is full of photos of what the city fathers have built in the past decade: a baseball stadium, an arena (where Neil Diamond played to a half-empty auditorium for a million-dollar fee), a swanky hotel \u2013 all around a redeveloped waterfront. They're the kind of job-free cultural makeover projects that middle-aged officials threw up all over the west in the noughties. In Stockton, estimates Jeffrey Michael at the local University of the Pacific, they were largely paid for by $100m in bonds issued over three years. For Ann Johnston, who only took over as mayor after the building spree: \"Paying for these things is why we're now bust.\"</p> <p>Well, yes and no; Stockton's problems go much deeper. Spend even a little time here and you notice something missing: middle-income employment. To the south are low-wage warehouses and food-processing plants, but the local public sector is the only home for anyone who wants a middle-class job without having to drive two hours. The city's regeneration and its encouragement of new housing estates was an attempt to bring in middle class people while skirting over the lack of decent private-sector employment. \"They wanted a white-tablecloth kind of town,\" says former planning official Denise Jefferson.</p> <p>The most grotesque example of that was a restaurant. Paragary's does a roaring business in the state capital of Sacramento, selling hand-cut rosemary noodles with seared chicken to people with large expense accounts. The city paid $2.7m in redevelopment funds to build a branch of Paragary's: its valet parking and expensive menu drew more resentment than custom, and it closed down within months.</p> <p>In some ways, the entire debacle was no different from what much of Britain tried under New Labour. Except that, since Californian cities depend on property and retail taxes, Stockton council had a vested interest in inflating its bubble \u2013 only then could it keep paying for services and infrastructure to the new housing estates. As former city manager Dwayne Milnes says, \"The entire system was a Ponzi scheme.\"</p> <p>The result is a glut of houses and a glut of debt, both of which will take a long time to sort out. It's hard to imagine a time when the builders' cranes will start up again. The downtown developer Dan Cort tells me about a rival who recently pulled plans to build new houses on land by the motorway. \"He's made it a walnut orchard instead.\" En route to the airport, the University of California sociologist Jesus Hernandez and I stop off and there they are: instead of rows of suburban homes, lines of walnut trees. Far away is the belch of Central Valley traffic; close up is the hiss of sprinklers.</p> <p>As we set off, I mumble something sentimental about Stockton's retreat from postmodern financial engineering back to its agricultural roots. Jesus corrects me: \"He's probably passing it off as farmland and getting a great tax break.\"</p>",
  "<p>The people who are gaming out what New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's praise of Obama means for 2016 are the ones with all the power. And I mean this literally: they have power, because no one camping out with candles and kerosene heaters is thinking about 2016. If you're thinking about 2016, you also have time on your hands from giving up on the poll-average pundit Pictionary in favor of cost-free speculation about the inner life of a man who seems pretty willing to let it all hang out.</p> <p>Take off the binoculars, and pick up a Twitter stream or a Facebook feed \u2013 the ones where people are asking for, and sometimes offering, gas, food or electricity. (One of the most moving pictures of the past day was of someone hanging an extension cord off their fence with the invitation to \"charge your phones!\" That says a lot about the reality of social networks as lifelines; it also suggests we'll need a new hobo chalk sign vocabulary for the post-post-infrastructure age.)</p> <p>Go without power for a while and see if five days doesn't seem like forever \u2013 four years from now is a pleasant daydream. If Christie <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=50134316n\">really was riding alongside Obama in Marine One</a> looking at the hurricane's devastation thinking to himself, \"This will make a great ad,\" he's a moral monster. And if he wasn't thinking mostly about getting some sleep, then he's a better person than I am. Rush Limbaugh probably didn't mean it as a compliment when he said Christie was playing the role of a \"<a href=\"http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2012/10/31/chris_christie_plays_role_of_greek_column_for_the_obama_reelection_campaign\">Greek column</a>\" during Obama's visit, though it would be a nice gloss over the governor's silhouette. More to the point, it's the president who's offering support to Christie.</p> <p>The chin-scratchers in their warm and dry perches are, apparently, too far away to see that the Christie-Obama \"bromance\", while certainly transactional, wasn't a feel-good exchange of airy endorsements. Christie didn't laud anything as ineffable as leadership or hopefulness, he pointed to specific actions: the calls Obama made, the pledges of quantifiable support. In an election year, we tend to forget that campaigning isn't the point; it's what comes after. And Christie <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Elections/President/2012/1031/As-Obama-Christie-survey-storm-damage-politics-is-unavoidable-video\">boiled it down</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We're doing the jobs that people elected us to do.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>It's not cynical to point out that such praise can co-exist with genuine ideological differences. You can be grateful for Fema aid while still believing in a more decentralized federal government. I mean, your argument is going to have to be a lot more <em>detailed</em> \u2013 and you'd be wise <em>not</em> to call for <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/10/30/romney_right_on_the_button_to_dismantle_fema_says_gop_strategist/\">the dismantling of, say, Fema</a> \u2013 but accepting government assistance never means you have to approve of everything the government does. Thank God. Christie doesn't have to turn in his Republican badge, and he can run against Obama without being a hypocrite.</p> <p>Christie's pointed plaudits to the president <em>do</em> undermine the kind of cheap plays on stereotypes that made up pretty much all the non-Christie portions of his Republican convention keynote address. As Jon Stewart pointed out, a recent Christie speech accused the president of <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/01/jon-stewart-applauds-hurricane-sandy-response_n_2057024.html\">fumbling</a> for the \"light-switch of leadership\"; post-Sandy, as Stewart quipped:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Yeah, I guess he found that fucking light switch, huh?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>A better metaphor might be to point out that, with the power out, all cats look alike in the dark. Christie is a decent governor and a real person, and I think his appearing with Obama \u2013 and his pleading for help \u2013 was the shortest of short-term thinking for him, shouting \"fire\" in a theater that was, in fact, on fire.</p> <p>How will Christie's pragmatism itself play politically? The questions cascade. If he's not thinking about running for president, fine \u2013 but what about the people who are thinking about him thinking of running for president? Can someone so willing to put aside politics in favor of personal action (rather than personal gain) attract the support of the GOP's fevered base? Could a Christie nomination pull the GOP to the middle?</p> <p>The thing about the Republican party of recent years is that it seems to do the pulling. Sure, Christie was a heavily-courted possible contender, even as Romney was in the middle of molting his moderate feathers. But was that evidence of GOP thought-leaders being willing to compromise on their own dearly-held, unpopular positions on such as climate change, or was it a sign of their confidence in a presidential nominee as a placeholder? Christie is an attractive candidate no matter what shade the rest of the party is, but who would change their colors more?</p> <p>Christie's weight has been the much-mocked obstacle to his rise in national politics, but would the Republican party require him to shed beliefs, as well as some pounds? When Romney decided to mold himself into whatever he needed to be to gain the party's nomination, it was relatively easy: there was no original form to change. For Christie to undergo such a transformation, in whatever way, though, he'd only become half the man he used to be.</p>",
  "<p>The memory of Bush versus Gore will be hanging over next Tuesday's election like a black cloud. Could it be possible that, as in 2000, we wake up on Wednesday morning with the next occupant of the White House still undecided?</p> <p>Quite possible, says Professor Edward Foley, an expert in election law at Ohio State University. He estimates, based on his knowledge of the legal landscape and his reading of the polls, that there could be up to a 1% chance of the outcome of the election still being in the balance beyond next Tuesday.</p> <p>He goes further. He says that the US should embrace the possibility of a delayed result as a necessary and healthy part of the electoral process in the advent of a very close race. \"Just because we are forced into overtime on 7 November doesn't automatically mean we are in crisis,\" he says. \"Such uncertainty is not a reason for panic.\"</p> <p>Here are some possible doomsday scenarios that could leave us still guessing next Wednesday morning:</p> <h2>Storm Sandy</h2> <p>As the fallout of the storm continues to play out across several north-eastern states, the question arises could major disruption to voting centres cause a delay. It's possible, though highly unlikely, that Congress could pass legislation postponing the election. Federal officials have indicated that individual states should decide. Those most affected by the storm, notably New Jersey and New York, are so firmly Democratic that there is no doubt about their outcome. Virginia is the only battleground that has been heavily affected, yet latest estimates suggest power should be restored in most areas of the state by Friday.</p> <h2>Too close to call</h2> <p>It's possible that a state whose crop of electoral votes could determine the identity of the next president \u2013 Florida with 29 votes, perhaps, or Ohio with 18 \u2013 could be so close that either candidate refuses to concede and demands a recount. Florida's recount debacle in 2000 famously went all the way to the US supreme court and was finally awarded to George Bush by just 537 votes. It's also possible that several states are too close to call, leading to a multiple agony of indecision. That happened in 1916, with America's position in the first world war hanging on the election, when so many states were exceptionally close that Woodrow Wilson's victory over Charles Hughes was delayed for many days. In 1876, four states were in dispute, pushing back the victory of Rutherford Hayes for months to the eve of his March inauguration.</p> <p>If a recount happened in Ohio next week it could delay the final result of the presidential race until 11 December.</p> <h2>Provisional ballots</h2> <p>In an attempt to avoid the 2000 snarl-up repeating itself, Congress passed the 2002 Help America Vote Act to try and modernise the system. That has increased the role of provisional ballots, which are cast by voters where there is a question mark over their eligibility and are counted after election day. Several swing states \u2013 for instance Colorado, Florida, Nevada and Virginia \u2013 have had substantial numbers of provisional ballots in recent elections. The phenomenon is particularly acute in the key battleground state of Ohio where more than 200,000 provisional ballots were cast in 2008. Were sufficient provisional ballots cast this year in Ohio to put a close result in jeopardy, then the outcome in Ohio and thus potentially in the entire presidential race <a href=\"http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/electionlaw/freefair/index.php?ID=9905\">could be delayed until 17 November</a>.</p> <h2>Absentee and military ballots</h2> <p>It is conceivable that a dispute could erupt over absentee or military ballots in a very close race. Consider what happened in Minnesota in 2008, where Al Franken's eventually successful challenge to the incumbent senator Norm Coleman was delayed by more than seven months by wrangling over absentee ballots.</p> <p>Colorado, Florida and Virginia all have large military bases and are therefore likely to have a substantial number of military ballots which could be important in a razor-close vote.</p> <h2>A 269-269 tie</h2> <p>It takes 270 electoral votes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/sep/28/us-electoral-college-explained\">to earn the keys to the White House</a>. It is theoretically possible that there could be a tie between Obama and Romney of 269 votes to 269. In that event, the House of Representatives would choose the president in a ballot to be held in January in which each state delegation in the House would have one vote. The vice-president would be chosen by the Senate. <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/28/opinion/la-oe-klotsche-electoral-college-apocalypse-20121028\">Pundits have had a lot of fun</a> envisaging the remote prospect that Mitt Romney is elected Republican president with Joe Biden as his Democratic vice-president.</p>",
  "<p>If the political postings you've seen lately on Facebook and Twitter seem particularly outrageous, it's because they are.<br> From the beginning of the political conventions to the eve of the final debate, social media and blog postings about US presidential candidates Barack Obama and Mitt Romney have been relentlessly negative, <a href=\"http://www.journalism.org/analysis_report/winning_media_campaign_2012\">according to a new Pew study.</a><br> \"We found social media very harsh,\" Tom Rosenstiel, director of Pew's Project for Excellence in Journalism, told the Guardian. \"We also found it fairly insensitive to events. It moved some but was pretty relentlessly negative about both candidates, particularly Romney.\"</p> <p>There is no doubt mainstream media coverage influences what is being said on social media, especially on Facebook, where users tend to be more politically engaged and often more partisan. In the Pew analysis, two outlets in particular were clearly slanted in opposite directions: for every 23 stories published by MSNBC about Romney, only one is positive. At Fox News, only about one in every eight stories published about Obama is positive.<br> With coverage of this campaign markedly more negative than 2008, it's leaking over into what we're sharing. By all accounts we're going stir crazy: everything's offensive, outrageous, or both at once. And, sometimes, the constant pot-stirring results in the breakdown of friendships between people of differing political stripes. The tension is especially palpable on Facebook. Pew's team found that conversation about both candidates hit overdrive on the social network after the 3 October presidential debate, an event considered a solid victory for Romney. Since that evening, the conversation has gotten decidedly less civil, perhaps because social media conversation is <a href=\"http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/enhanced-buzz-wide-31489-1341954714-11.jpg\">already more partisan</a> than what is found in public opinion or in mainstream media, according to Rosenstiel.<br> When this writer posed a question about political clashes on Facebook, Chicago attorney Walker Lawrence said Thursday he'd been \"unfriended\" for \"my support for Obama \u2026 happened this year and in 2008.\" As for Twitter, a comparatively smaller, more self-selecting network, negative statements about Obama outweighed positive by less than 2-to-1. For Romney it was close to 4-to-1. \"It is a great way to learn about events,\" Rosenstiel added, \"but it is not, certainly at this point in history, a proxy of the electorate.\" Patience is boiling over on both networks as Americans near the end of a marathon election cycle. Earlier this year, Pew's Internet and American Life project found that 18% of users have unfriended or blocked someone online due to political issues. With only a few days to go until the election, don't be surprised if the number rises \u2013 if only just until sometime in mid-November. But even as tempers flare this week and next, an increasingly rare story sparked by social media is bringing people together instead of tearing them apart. After many months without anything like it, a viral video of Fort Collins toddler Abigael Evans emerged on YouTube this week.  \"I'm tired of Bronco Bamma and Mitt Romney,\" the red-eyed four-year-old blubbered into an NPR reporter's camera, and charmed <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjrthOPLAKM\">millions of jaded YouTube </a>viewers as she was literally bored to tears.<br> Thousands of exhausted people smiled knowingly and hit the share button.</p>",

Fighters from the Salafi Dawood brigade overran the camp and captured the soldiers. Initially there were only ten of them so they could not take the soldiers captive, and had to kill them immediately. No trial could be held because the fighting was still going on. This is guerrilla warfare.</p> <p>The soldiers there included snipers who had shot four fighters from the Dawood brigade. </p> <p>The Dawood brigade and the Suqur Al-Sham organisation do not answer to any military council affiliated to the FSA. They work independently and have their own leader whom they call Ameer and his name is Abu Issa.</p> <p>Yesterday we had a demonstration in Jebal al-Zawiyia and we raised banners in response to Hillary Clinton's statement that Assad's end is imminent. We said: \"al-Qaida arrival\u2019s in Syria is imminent too.\"</p> <p>We do not wish to turn Syria into another Afghanistan, but we can't stop these extremists groups. We are really worried about the future of Syria. We need weapons and media support, but there is nothing on the ground.</p> <p>We have four Salafi groups who are fighting in Idlib province. The biggest group is Jabhat al-Nusra which has members all over Syria. There is also the Ansar al-Islam group, the Majless al-Shura group and Suqur al-Sham group.</p> <p>These Salafi groups are gaining support in Idlib province as they are well equipped unlike the FSA brigades. People also admire their bravery.</p> <p>They are tough fighters and when they get hold of soldiers, they kill them at once.</p> <p>They are getting more powerful and in in the future could start forcing people to follow sharia law. It is a big problem.</p> <p>They are so strict about new recruits. If someone smokes or does not pray that much, he is not accepted. They only accept hardliners and we have few Syrians hardliners here. All the suicide fighters come from outside of Syria. Most of the suicide fighters are Saudis.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;iframe marginheight=&quot;0&quot; marginwidth=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?msa=0&amp;amp;msid=200547086913577029119.0004cd806677ade01716d&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;t=p&amp;amp;ll=35.876533,36.76403&amp;amp;spn=0.097366,0.145912&amp;amp;z=12&amp;amp;output=embed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; width=&quot;425&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;View &lt;a href=&quot;https://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?msa=0&amp;amp;msid=200547086913577029119.0004cd806677ade01716d&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;t=p&amp;amp;ll=35.876533,36.76403&amp;amp;spn=0.097366,0.145912&amp;amp;z=12&amp;amp;source=embed&quot; style=&quot;color:#0000FF;text-align:left&quot;&gt;Saraqeb&lt;/a&gt; in a larger map&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5093d33895cb1506d2444752\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-02T14:05:44.887Z\">2.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Russia condemns Clinton's Syrian opposition plans</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Russia has expressed its alarm about US-backed plans to create a Syrian \"government in exile\".</p> <p>Foreign ministry spokesman <a href=\"http://www.mid.ru/brp_4.nsf/newsline/393BD239CFF3687C44257AAA0042C7E9\">Alexander&#xa0;Lukashevich claimed the plans flout an agreement reached in Geneva,</a> brokered in June by former international envoy Kofi Annan.</p> <p>It called for democratic change in Syria \"in accordance with the aspirations of the Syrian people\".</p> <p>He accused the US of trying to settle the Syrian crisis on its own terms.</p> <p>Lukashevich urged the Syrian opposition to enter dialogue with the Assad government.</p> <p>Russia's deputy foreign minister Gennady Gatilov echoed the same points on his Twitter account.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GGatilov/status/264268987515424768\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Syrian opposition's Western sponsors violate Geneva agreements when trying to impose from outside a list of future leadership of the country</p>&mdash; Gennady Gatilov (@GGatilov) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GGatilov/status/264268987515424768\" data-datetime=\"2012-11-02T07:33:31+00:00\">November 2, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GGatilov/status/264269168470265856\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Geneva Communiqu\u00e9 says: \"...transitional governing body ... shall be formed on the basis of mutual consent\".</p>&mdash; Gennady Gatilov (@GGatilov) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GGatilov/status/264269168470265856\" data-datetime=\"2012-11-02T07:34:14+00:00\">November 2, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-02T15:15:41.647Z\">at 3.15pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5093cce7b579f74bac764959\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-02T13:38:47.376Z\">1.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">SNC leader dismissive of Clinton plan</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The leader of the beleaguered Syrian National Council has accused Hillary Clinton of <a href=\"http://twitter.com/zaidbenjamin/statuses/264338402265137152\">ignoring the complexity of the Syrian</a> crisis after she backed a rival opposition council.</p> <p>In an interview the journalist Zaid Benjamin Abdel Basset Sayda insisted that the SNC represented the <a href=\"http://twitter.com/zaidbenjamin/statuses/264339356846796800\">\"voice of the revolution\"</a>.</p> <p>On Wednesday the US secretary of state confirmed US backing for new a new broad-based opposition council \u2013 the Syrian National Initiative [SNI].</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middle-east-live/2012/nov/01/syria-conflict-clinton-opposition-overhaul-live#block-509233f395cb39eabe475ee3\">She said</a>: \"We have recommended names and organisations that we believe should be included in any leadership structure.

  "<p>An army of thousands of lawyers is quietly amassing in the key swing states ahead of next Tuesday's presidential election in preparation for the largest legal ground operation to be fought in any American election.</p> <p>Hundreds of paid lawyers employed by the Obama and Romney campaigns, backed by a reserve force of thousands of volunteer attorneys who are jetting into the battleground states this weekend, will be monitoring polling stations on 6 November. Their job will be to prevent the rival side gaining an unfair advantage, and to be at hand to litigate should the vote be too close to call.</p> <p>\"Thousands and thousands of lawyers will be out on election day ferreting out any problems with voting rights,\" said Joseph Sandler, who led the Democratic party's legal team for 15 years until 2008. The attorneys will be on the look out for irregularities such as malfunctioning polling equipment, election officials failing to follow rules, or irregular opening hours at the polling stations, he said.</p> <p>The presidential election of 2012 will herald the largest and most intricate legal ground game yet seen. \"Very sophisticated operations have been put together in the swing states by both main parties, and my sense is that if they do go into battle they will be evenly matched,\" said Professor Edward Foley, who runs an election law centre at Ohio State University.</p> <p>Over the past decade, the legal aspect of presidential elections has moved from a sideshow to being central to the campaigning process. The impetus for the shift was the 2000 election and the notorious legal fight that followed the disputed Florida result.</p> <p>The events of that year, which ended up with the US supreme court blocking a recount and handing George Bush the presidency, caught both Republicans and Democrats off guard. Both sides have vowed never again to be put in that invidious position.</p> <p>Sandler, who was a key adviser to Al Gore in his unsuccessful attempt to force a Florida recount in 2000, has watched the legal operation grow into a veritable army since that highly contentious election. By 2004, paid lawyers were already in place well in advance of election day, and by 2008, Barack Obama had developed a sophisticated network of lawyers that is likely to be the model in future elections.</p> <p>This year that model is being followed again, \"but this time it is much more extensive,\" Sandler said.</p> <p>At its most dramatic, the army of lawyers assembled by both presidential campaigns could be called upon to litigate in the event of a battleground state returning so close a result that one of the candidates refuses to concede and demands a recount. In 2004, lawyers for John Kerry came close to challenging the result in Ohio but backed off after they realised that Bush had accumulated sufficient votes to win the state, and with it the presidency.</p> <p>\"When you have an incredibly close election as next Tuesday looks like it might be, it increases the chances of legal disputes and delays in announcing the winner,\" said Lawrence Norden, a voting rights experts at the Brennan Center for Justice within New York University.</p> <p>On the Democratic side, paid and voluntary lawyers will be keeping a particularly beady eye out for any signs of intimidation or disenfranchisement of voters in the wake of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/26/florida-assault-voting-rights\">a slew of attempts by Republican legislatures to restrict voting practices this year</a>. Most of the new voter suppression laws have been stayed by the courts, but Obama's legal army will be watching out for any residual foul play.</p> <p>The lawyers leading the respective armies are two of the biggest shots in election law in the US. The Republican operation is led by Benjamin Ginsberg, who headed Bush's legal team in the 2000 Florida recount dispute.</p> <p>A former newspaper reporter with the Boston Globe, Ginsberg went on to become pre-eminent in election law. After his success in 2000, he commanded the army of attorneys deployed in Bush's in 2004 re-election, and has been at the legal helm of Romney's run on the White House both in 2008 and this year.</p> <p>His counterpart for Obama is Bob Bauer, former White House counsel who returned last year to his private law firm Perkins Coie so he could spearhead the president's re-election bid from outside government. Bauer has been giving Obama legal advice ever since Obama came to Washington as a US senator in 2005.</p> <p>Bauer and Ginsberg are at the top of a pyramid structure that will see lawyers for both presidential candidates in place right across the battleground states come election day. Both teams have been working for months on preparing for whatever eventuality fate throws at them next Tuesday.</p> <p>\"You never know what comes up on election day. If the operation has done its job right, election day will be relatively uneventful as all the heavy lifting is done before then,\" said Sandler.</p> <p>As the legal armies have grown since 2000, they have come to rely increasingly on volunteer attorneys flying in to the key swing states for election day. The Obama for America campaign has used its digital organising tool, Dashboard, to mobilise lawyers, paralegals and law students and direct them to the polling stations where they are needed most \u2013 <a href=\"https://dashboard.barackobama.com/groups/1664-victory-counsel-\">a project called Victory Counsel</a>.</p> <p>A campaign official said: \"While it is easy to vote and we expect the election process to run smoothly, Obama For America has a team of legal volunteers and professionals prepared in case any difficulties do emerge.\"</p> <p>Philip Raible, a commercial litigator with the New York firm Rayner Rowe, is flying at his own cost to Cleveland, Ohio, on Saturday to volunteer for Obama's legal team. On Sunday he will spend three hours in a training session on election law, before being dispatched on election day to a precinct of Cleveland to monitor the poll.</p> <p>Coming from out of state, Raible is not able to enter a polling station, issue proceedings or appear before Ohio judges himself, so he will be acting in a purely supporting role to local lawyers on the campaign. But he thinks the effort will be worthwhile.</p> <p>\"I'm doing it because as a Democratic resident of New York, a Democratic state, my vote has very little impact on the election nationally, whereas if I can help Obama win Ohio it will have a much greater impact,\" he said.</p> <p>While lawyers will be fanning out through all the crucial swing states \u2013 including Colorado, Iowa, Nevada, Wisconsin and Virginia \u2013 the most intensive efforts will be in Florida and Ohio given their history of litigation in 2000 and 2004 respectively.</p>",
  "<p>The floods and fires that swept through our city left a path of destruction that will require years of recovery and rebuilding work. And in the short term, our subway system remains partially shut down, and many city residents and businesses still have no power. In just 14 months, two hurricanes have forced us to evacuate neighborhoods - something our city government had never done before. If this is a trend, it is simply not sustainable.</p> <p>Our climate is changing. And while the increase in extreme weather we have experienced in New York City and around the world may or may not be the result of it, the risk that it might be - given this week's devastation - should compel all elected leaders to take immediate action.</p> <p>Here in New York, our comprehensive sustainability plan - PlaNYC - has helped allow us to cut our carbon footprint by 16 percent in just five years, which is the equivalent of eliminating the carbon footprint of a city twice the size of Seattle. Through the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group - a partnership among many of the world's largest cities - local governments are taking action where national governments are not.</p> <p><strong>Leadership needed</strong></p> <p>But we can't do it alone. We need leadership from the White House - and over the past four years, President Barack Obama has taken major steps to reduce our carbon consumption, including setting higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars and trucks. His administration also has adopted tighter controls on mercury emissions, which will help to close the dirtiest coal power plants (an effort I have supported through my philanthropy), which are estimated to kill 13,000 Americans a year.</p> <p>Mitt Romney, too, has a history of tackling climate change. As governor of Massachusetts, he signed on to a regional cap- and-trade plan designed to reduce carbon emissions 10 percent below 1990 levels. \"The benefits (of that plan) will be long-lasting and enormous - benefits to our health, our economy, our quality of life, our very landscape. These are actions we can and must take now, if we are to have 'no regrets' when we transfer our temporary stewardship of this Earth to the next generation,\" he wrote at the time.</p> <p>He couldn't have been more right. But since then, he has reversed course, abandoning the very cap-and-trade program he once supported. This issue is too important. We need determined leadership at the national level to move the nation and the world forward.</p> <p>I believe Mitt Romney is a good and decent man, and he would bring valuable business experience to the Oval Office. He understands that America was built on the promise of equal opportunity, not equal results. In the past he has also taken sensible positions on immigration, illegal guns, abortion rights and health care. But he has reversed course on all of them, and is even running against the health-care model he signed into law in Massachusetts.</p> <p>If the 1994 or 2003 version of Mitt Romney were running for president, I may well have voted for him because, like so many other independents, I have found the past four years to be, in a word, disappointing.</p> <p>In 2008, Obama ran as a pragmatic problem-solver and consensus-builder. But as president, he devoted little time and effort to developing and sustaining a coalition of centrists, which doomed hope for any real progress on illegal guns, immigration, tax reform, job creation and deficit reduction. And rather than uniting the country around a message of shared sacrifice, he engaged in partisan attacks and has embraced a divisive populist agenda focused more on redistributing income than creating it.</p> <p><strong>Important victories</strong></p> <p>Nevertheless, the president has achieved some important victories on issues that will help define our future. His Race to the Top education program - much of which was opposed by the teachers' unions, a traditional Democratic Party constituency - has helped drive badly needed reform across the country, giving local districts leverage to strengthen accountability in the classroom and expand charter schools. His health-care law -- for all its flaws -- will provide insurance coverage to people who need it most and save lives.</p> <p>When I step into the voting booth, I think about the world I want to leave my two daughters, and the values that are required to guide us there. The two parties' nominees for president offer different visions of where they want to lead America.</p> <p>One believes a woman's right to choose should be protected for future generations; one does not. That difference, given the likelihood of Supreme Court vacancies, weighs heavily on my decision.</p> <p>One recognizes marriage equality as consistent with America's march of freedom; one does not. I want our president to be on the right side of history.</p> <p>One sees climate change as an urgent problem that threatens our planet; one does not. I want our president to place scientific evidence and risk management above electoral politics.</p> <p>Of course, neither candidate has specified what hard decisions he will make to get our economy back on track while also balancing the budget. But in the end, what matters most isn't the shape of any particular proposal; it's the work that must be done to bring members of Congress together to achieve bipartisan solutions.</p> <p>Presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan both found success while their parties were out of power in Congress - and President Obama can, too. If he listens to people on both sides of the aisle, and builds the trust of moderates, he can fulfill the hope he inspired four years ago and lead our country toward a better future for my children and yours. And that's why I will be voting for him.</p> <p>\u2022 Michael R Bloomberg is mayor of New York and founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP.</p> <p>\u2022 This article <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-01/a-vote-for-a-president-to-lead-on-climate-change.html\">first appeared on Bloomberg View 2012</a>.

  "<p>If Barack Obama's re-election campaign has lacked the magic of four years ago, there is one place where \"the audacity of hope\" still shines: Kogelo, the blink-and-you'll-miss-it village in western Kenya where his father grew up.</p> <p>Here, there is no talk of the US president losing to his Republican challenger Mitt Romney on Tuesday.</p> <p>Motorbike taxi drivers, shop workers, and vegetable sellers say they are praying hard. But such is their faith in Kenya's most famous honorary son that many are also already planning the post-election celebrations. \"We don't think he will win. We know,\" says Peter Evans, who drives a motorbike taxi, or <em>boda-boda</em>.</p> <p>George Ochieng, 23, another driver relaxing along with Evans and other men under a tree hung with weaver bird nests in the centre of the village, agrees. \"We heard he killed Osama [bin Laden]. That was one thing he did,\" he says, as another man chimes in: \"He promised us that.\"</p> <p>Sitting on a low wall nearby, Elizabeth Mola Odondo, 60, who says her husband and the president's father, Barack Obama Sr, were cousins, is equally adamant. \"I'm not worried at all,\" she says. \"I'm very confident.\"</p> <p>And if the unthinkable happened?</p> <p>\"It will be a bitter pill to swallow but we are praying day in and day out for him,\" she says in the local Luo language, adding: \"There is a big celebration coming.\"</p> <p>Mola Odondo says she knows <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2008/jun/06/obama.grandmother\" title=\"\">Obama's stepgrandmother, Mama Sarah</a>, who still lives in Kogelo, and got to shake his hand when he last visited the village as a senator in 2006.

Obama Sr married Ann Dunham from Kansas while studying in Hawaii. Their son, Barack, was born there, but the couple separated when the child was two.</p> <p>In his 1995 memoir, Dreams From My Father, the president tells how he met Mama Sarah when he travelled to Kenya in search of his roots in his 20s, describing her as a large woman with a \"smooth and big-boned\" face and \"sparkling, laughing eyes\".</p> <p>Members of the Obama family said this week that the matriarch, who is now 90, did not plan to speak to the media \u2013 a police officer at her still-modest compound said she was sleeping when the Guardian visited.</p> <p>Inside the green gates, where cows were feeding at a trough under the trees, is the grave of her stepson, who died in a car crash in 1982.</p> <p>Said Hussein Obama, Mama Sarah's son and the president's half-uncle, is sure voters would give Barack Obama a second chance.</p> <p>\"Among his top achievements,\" he says in an email, \"he has restored the trust in, and dignity of, America among the international community, which were severely damaged by his predecessor.\"</p> <p>He says the president has performed well, considering what he has inherited from George W Bush, citing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the economic slump.</p> <p>\"[Obama] has brought honour and glory to a once-sleepy village \u2026 he has placed Kogelo on the world map,\" he says.</p> <p>Kogelo residents agree. Beatrice Akoth's hand glides elegantly through the air as the pregnant mother-of-six enumerates the benefits this fame has brought. \"There have been big improvements. There is water everywhere in the town. Before, the water was not clean. There's electricity and roads. The children get a good education. Occasionally, they go to Mama Sarah's and she provides maize and other food,\" she says in Luo.</p> <p>Said Hussein Obama says schools, a clinic, cultural centre and hotels have been built since his relative was elected. \"The ball is now in the court of the residents to make use of these facilities to help them grow.\"</p> <p>Other benefits are less tangible. In a motor parts shop, Kelvin Otieno Ouma remembers the day in 2006 when Obama came to his school. Otieno Ouma was 14 and head boy. He recalls how Obama ended his speech with <em>erokamano</em> \u2013 thank you in Luo.</p> <p>\"When I saw him,\" he says, \"I thought: we can make it. Despite your family background or how poor you are, you can achieve your goals through focus and determination. He made the students of the school work very hard to achieve their goals.\"</p> <p>Otieno Ouma dreams of being an orator and lawyer. He is saving to go to university in the capital, Nairobi, but says he still needs a sponsor. But Kogelo is still waiting for a visit from President Obama.

  "<p>Poverty is America's economic Hurricane Sandy. Close to <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2011/11/21/373432/vitter-food-stamp-cap/?mobile=nc\">50 million Americans</a> \u2013 a number equal to the populations of the states hardest hit by the devastating storm \u2013 are below the poverty line. But one wouldn't know it from the <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/blog/170749/home-foreclosures-missing-presidential-debates\">silence of Barack Obama and Mitt Romney</a> on the topic. In contrast to the physical storm, neither presidential candidate has promised the full resources of the government that they wish to lead in turning the tide on this searing issue. Their dual muteness is shocking given what's at stake.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/09/12/161013227/poverty-rate-unchanged-but-still-historically-high\">One in six Americans is poor</a>. Due to the ravages of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, their ranks have grown to the highest level in almost a generation. Most of those in poverty are the working poor \u2013 those employed but who don't earn enough to live \u2013 and their children. Though the poor are overwhelmingly white, poor people are disproportionately black and brown. <a href=\"http://www.npc.umich.edu/publications/policy_briefs/brief16/index.php\">One in three African Americans</a> is poor, as is <a href=\"http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/lifestyle/2012/09/12/one-in-every-4-us-hispanics-lives-in-poverty/\">one in four Latinos</a>. Though poverty has grown, when it comes to actual discussion during this year's presidential race, you can hear a pin drop.</p> <p>Neither during the campaign nor his term in office has President Obama given one speech dedicated to poverty. In his second run for the presidency, besides the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/04/mitt-romney-47-percent_n_1941423.html\">wayward \"47%\" comment that the poor \"did not take responsibility for their lives\"</a>, Mitt Romney hasn't either. Poverty was barely discussed during any of the presidential debates. The topic is nowhere to be found on either candidate's website. </p> <p>An absence of real talk on poverty is not a surprise. Ronald Reagan successfully fused the issue of poverty with racial animosity in his first bid for the White House. In 1976, the \"Great Commnunicator\" \u2013 playing off of southern white resentment of economic and social change in the 1960s and 1970s \u2013 falsely labeled America's poor as black \"<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/19/opinion/19krugman.html\">welfare queens</a>\". Ever since, this distortion of poverty has served as an effective way to get votes from the white working class.</p> <p>The issue became radioactive for Democrats and remains so. Republicans even managed to jujitsu President Bill Clinton into <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/11/what-it-will-take-for-barack-obama-to-become-the-next-fdr/264195/\">dismantling the program of federal assistance</a> for the poor instituted by Franklin D Roosevelt. </p> <p>Reagan's poverty slight-of-hand worked so well that Mitt Romney, in a tight race, tried it himself. Trailing among white women, Romney unleashed a summer-long attack on welfare. Romney <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/ct-oped-0812-page-20120812,0,5718812.column\">falsely accused</a> Obama of secretly rolling back the program's work requirement and five-year cap instituted under Clinton. \"Under Obama's plan \u2026 they just send you your check,\" the ad bogusly asserted. But the president never did such a thing, and the lie was eventually exposed.</p> <p>Romney's attempt to gain votes through racial division consequently ran out of gas. But that wouldn't stop the campaign from trying again.</p> <p>Last week, in a move also aimed at white women, Republican vice-presidential-nominee Paul Ryan <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/health/2012/10/25/1087591/paul-ryan-contraception-threat/\">gave a speech on the poor</a>. Ryan pledged his ticket's support for \"upward mobility\" to end poverty. While laying out his vision, he faulted America's expansion of racial and economic justice programs under Democratic President Lyndon Johnson for the current iniquities. Oddly, he claimed that the best way to increase economic opportunity for the poor is to end the very education, health, and work-support programs that poor men and women use to exit impoverishment.</p> <p>Polls taken in the speech's wake show that Ryan's desire to pull up the economic ladder didn't fare well. Like the first attempt, the latest political push on the poor ran out of gas.</p> <p>Though neither presidential candidate may have addressed it straight on as a public policy issue, poverty <em>can</em> be rolled back and millions lifted it from it. In the last 50 years, poverty has come down during periods when strong economic growth meets aggressive government policies to catapult the poor into the working and middle classes. These programs \u2013 specifically in education, health, housing, transportation, work-skill development and racial discrimination \u2013 are what's truly needed to make America an economically fairer place.</p> <p>America has <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/16/business/economy/a-slow-recovery-but-its-all-relative.html\">slowly started to recover from recession</a>. It's time that the country get back to the business of focusing on the poor.</p> <p>But instead, what we've gotten is the continuation of policies which extend the 30 year-long reorientation of government from the needs of the many towards the needs of the super-rich. The numbers show it. Poverty is at a record high, but <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/26/us/politics/top-earners-doubled-share-of-nations-income-cbo-says.html\">so is the top 1%'s share of national income</a>. Poverty and income inequality are moving in tandem, in the wrong direction. Only renewed action to make the economy work for everybody will reverse it.</p> <p>Sadly, instead of redirecting the economic winds to everyone's benefit, both candidates are all too eager to continue to ride the waves of economic and political inertia.</p>",

  "<p>The US added 171,000 new jobs in October, far higher than expected and handing president Barack Obama's campaign a major boost four days before the election.</p> <p>It was the 25th consecutive month of jobs growth under Obama, but the rate of growth remained sluggish. Economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires had expected the US to create about 125,000 new jobs in October, following a gain of 114,000 in September \u2013 so Friday's numbers were better than expected. August and September's numbers were revised up.</p> <p>Last month's figures helped drive the US unemployment rate below the politically important rate of 8% for the first time since Obama took office in January 2009. The unemployment rate rose slightly from 7.8% to 7.9%.</p> <p>The political spinning began immediately. Mitt Romney said: \"Today's increase in the unemployment rate is a sad reminder that the economy is at a virtual standstill.\"</p> <p>\"The jobless rate is higher than it was when president Obama took office, and there are still 23m Americans struggling for work. On Tuesday, America will make a choice between stagnation and prosperity.\"</p> <p>Obama, speaking at a rally in Hilliard, Ohio, brushed over the job figures, slipping in just a sentence to his normal stump speech.</p> <p>\"Today our businesses have created nearly 5.5 million new jobs. And this morning we learned that companies hired more workers in October than at any time in the last eight months. The American auto industry is back on top. Home values and housing construction is on the rise. We are less dependent on foreign oil than any time in the last 20 years.</p> <p>\"We have made real progress but we are here today because we know we have got more work to do. As long as there is a single American who wants a job and can't find one, as long as there are families working harder but falling behind, as long as there is a child anywhere in this country languishing in poverty and barred from opportunity, our fight goes on. We have got more work to do.\"</p> <p>The Romney campaign has attached great importance to the monthly jobs figures. During the Republican national convention in Tampa, Florida, two months ago, one of Romney's senior strategist set out the basics of their campaign, some of which turned out as planned, such as a strong debate performance. Crucial to the strategy was the unemployment figures for August, released at the end of the Democratic national convention.</p> <p>That figure was a weak 96,000 and handed Romney a major boost. It has now been revised up to 192,000. The Romney campaigns strategy has been further weakened than better than expected jobs figures and an unemployment rate below the symbolically important 8% mark. Perhaps more importantly, superstorm Sandy has moved the economy off the top of the news agenda in the last few days before the election.</p> <p>David Semmens, a senior US economist at Standard Chartered, said the figures were encouraging: \"There's a slight tick up in unemployment, but it's for the right reasons; people who weren't looking for jobs are now looking. The upward revisions also suggest that things are picking up.\"</p> <p>Semmens said that jobs growth was still weak but that the recovery looked like it was on a stable footing.</p> <p>Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at BTIG, said the figure was much stronger than expected: \"Despite the improvement though, the rate of job creation remains woefully inadequate to meaningfully affect the unemployment rate, one reason why that rate rose in the month.\" he said.</p> <p>Nick Pokoluk, director at Personify, a recruitment consultant, said the figures were in line with his recent experience. \"Our clients, particularly in technology, engineering, software and healthcare, are more confident. Companies are much more confident about hiring than they were last year. We are even seeing a greater number of counteroffers for skilled workers that employers don't want to lose.\"</p> <p>But Pokoluk said it was clear big problems remained for less skilled workers and that the market still had a long way to go.</p> <p>Jobs came back in construction, which added 17,000 jobs, the most since January, further evidence of a recovery in the housing market. Manufacturing added 13,000 jobs after cutting back in the previous two months Professional services \u2013 such as architects and IT \u2013 also added jobs, as did retailers, hotels and restaurants, as well as education and health sectors. Government employment was cut again, losing 13,000 jobs in September, after three months of growth.</p> <p>Paul Conway, former chief of staff of the US department of labor and president of Generation Opportunity, a conservative youth group, said unemployment for 18- to 29-year-olds remained \"unacceptably high\" at 12%. \"We are looking at a generation of young Americans who have been denied economic opportunities,\" he said.</p> <p>The bureau of labor statistics said superstorm Sandy \"had no discernable effect on the employment and unemployment data for October\" as the data was collected before the storm.</p>",

The \"<a href=\"http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/Jobs_and_US_economic_recovery_A_panel_discussion_2843\">jobless recovery</a>\" seems to actually be adding jobs.&#xa0;</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/nov/01/jobs-figures-us-economy\">Housing, autos, consumer spending</a> \u2013 all have been indicating a recovery that is starting in earnest.

And it changes, or should change, something in the way we talk about and think about the US economy.&#xa0;There is a lot that has been written, lately, about&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/achenblog/post/free-nate-silver/2012/10/31/74bec65a-234f-11e2-8448-81b1ce7d6978_blog.html\">Nate Silver's numerical election analysis</a>&#xa0;and the death of \"<a href=\"http://www.ajr.org/article.asp?id=3253\">horse-race election coverage</a>\", in terms of the politics.</p> <p>But there has also been a kind of horse-race economics thinking, in newspapers and research reports. The economy has been treated like a month-by-month race towards some undefinable end, which we don't seem to be reaching anyway.&#xa0;Every month, with the jobs numbers, journalists and economists and analysts handicap whether the economy is recovering (that month) or suffering (that month). The big picture, hard to see, has been impossible to describe.&#xa0;</p> <p>It's highlighted with the popular Twitter hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NFPguesses&amp;src=typd\">#NFPguesses</a>, in which tweeters spend the morning of the jobs speculating on what the exact number of jobs added might be. It's a fun intellectual game, which actually only highlights how unpredictable and strange the unemployment figures have become.&#xa0;</p> <p>Now, it's more clear that the economy is going up \u2013 at least, most of the useful economic indicators we have are pointing that way. And if there's any fairness in the world, horse-race economic thinking should come to an end: the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/nov/01/jobs-figures-us-economy\">economy seems to be well on its way to recovery by most measures</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>So, perhaps, Superman (in the form of the BLS) is starting to put an end to the horse-race guesses of whether the economy is improving or not, and what that means for politicians, who, realistically, have no individual control over whether people are employed or not. It's become hard to doubt that a real, if modest, recovery in the economy is definitely happening.&#xa0;</p> <p>Josh Brown, a <a href=\"http://about.me/joshuamorganbrown\">blogger and analyst with Fusion Analytics</a>, put it best when he joked in a fake headline:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Economic recovery threatens \u2026 handwringing industry.</p> </blockquote> <p>And for Governor Mitt Romney, these jobs numbers, coming so close to the election, will naturally undercut his argument that the economy is bad \u2013 even though the jobs numbers are notoriously vague and inconclusive. That might leave him saying another famous quote from the Simpsons:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>D'oh!</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>On the BBC a few weeks ago the New York Times pundit David Brooks explained to his British audience that American voters are \"looking for an excuse to vote against the president\". Spot on, I thought. Voters are disappointed in the promise that Barack Obama represented in 2008, but Mitt Romney has been making it hard for swing voters to elect him president instead.</p> <p>Since then it's looked as if next Tuesday's ballot may swing Romney's way after all. But no. As hurricane Sandy roared up the US eastern seaboard, fate may have tipped the balance back in Obama's direction by showing him quietly in charge and reminding folks the government \u2013 local, state or federal \u2013 isn't always the enemy of Tea Party fantasy.</p> <p>Overnight we've also learned that New York's mayor, Michael Bloomberg, the little guy with the sign language aide at his side, soft-spoken but reassuring and on top of the detail, is backing Obama and by implication the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/nov/01/bloomberg-obama-endorsement-vote-big-government\" title=\"\">benign power of government</a>.</p> <p>That's quite a big deal, like Boris Johnson endorsing Ed Miliband \u2013 don't hold your breath, Ed \u2013 at the 2015 election here. Except that Bloomberg is an ex-Republican independent, a self-made billionaire who has the gravitas that Boris lacks, though he generally makes worse jokes.</p> <p>Hizzoner \u2013 as Americans call their big city mayors \u2013 is shrewdly political enough to praise Romney as a \"good and decent man\" who has done good things. Alas, \"he has reversed course on all of them\", including the healthcare model he created as governor of Massachusetts, the mayor noted in a statement. But the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/01/bloomberg-endorses-obama-climate-change\" title=\"\">clincher for Bloomberg is Romney's hostility to climate change</a>.</p> <p>This week's devastation \"may or may not be\" a result, but the risk requires \"immediate action\", Bloomberg concludes. That's spot on too. When I <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/oct/30/frankenstorm-sandy-monstrous-media-hysteria\" title=\"\">mocked CNN's hysterical buildup</a> to hurricane Sandy here this week I got it partly wrong. The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/01/east-coast-normalcy-hurricane-sandy\" title=\"\">havoc and death it actually wreaked</a> \u2013 as opposed to the spine-chilling advance publicity \u2013 was more severe than I initially grasped, as we all now know.</p> <p>But one of my complaints, which remains valid, was the widespread reluctance of many Americans to concede that manmade climate change may be a crucial driver of its increasingly turbulent continental weather. The daily US weather map that most newspapers carry can be extraordinary, a Wagnerian drama which piles two feet of snow on Idaho on the same day that oranges are ripening in Florida sunshine. Floods, snow, twisters, droughts; it's never dull.</p> <p>Yet it remains an article of faith with many Americans that they can master nature as they mastered their vast land \u2013 chopped down its forests, dammed its rivers, cultivated its deserts, drilled for its oil, tamed its forest fires. Herman Melville's classic MobyDick told them otherwise \u2013 the sea always wins \u2013 but it's not a message everyone wants to hear. Obama's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/nov/01/bloomberg-climate-change-closet-romney\" title=\"\">strategy</a> has been to let events talk for themselves.</p> <p>Bloomberg knows it \u2013 if you take a look at the storm, be careful, nature is stronger than us, he warned New Yorkers this week. After all, the great port city is surrounded by water \u2013 Manhattan, Long Island and Staten Island are just that \u2013 and the East and Hudson rivers are close to the vast Atlantic swell. The Thames Barrier, a mighty undertaking, currently protects London. It would not be enough to protect New York as water levels rise.</p> <p>The polarised ideological gridlock of Washington politics, far more severe than in post-cold-war Europe, exaggerates disagreements and damages politics: the failure to reach a compromise on federal taxes and spending still threatens the economic recovery, whoever wins on Tuesday. It needn't be that way. Just look at the courteous way Obama and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Christie\" title=\"\">Chris Christie</a>, admired Republican governor of New Jersey, have treated each other in this week's crisis.</p> <p>None of this plays Romney's way or the way Tea Party types want to see the world. I hesitate to say it's clinched re-election for the president. When Romney made his coarse assessment of the Democratic electoral base \u2013 the 47% of people who depend on benefits from the state \u2013 in September <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/18/mitt-romney-video-leak-gaffe\" title=\"\">I suggested it might</a> \u2013 might \u2013 be the turning point, ensuring the challenger's defeat.</p> <p>So it might have done, but for Obama's strikingly feeble performance in the first presidential debate. It was precisely the sort of event which \u2013 to quote Brooks \u2013 gave wavering voters an excuse to vote him out. If he looked so disengaged that he didn't seem to want the job, why not let the other fellow have a go?</p> <p>After all, he had not lived up to expectations, though in fairness to Obama a kind reader on Twitter draws my attention to <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/10/barack-obama-is-a-great-president-yes-great.html\" title=\"\">this robust defence</a> of the president's record by Jonathan Chait in the New York magazine. In the later debates Obama fought back \u2013 and now the hurricane has played to his strengths.</p> <p>Does it matter who wins? At the Cambridge Festival of Ideas last weekend I heard a panel of experts on Asia \u2013 one Korean, one Japanese and one Chinese \u2013 saying there is less interest than usual in the contest on their side of the Pacific. The US focus is tilting towards China (60% of US warships are now in the Pacific, we were told) but the anti-China rhetoric \u2013 formerly anti-Japanese \u2013 over unfair trade is much quieter in 2012.</p> <p>Whoever wins won't change US policy much (whatever aggressive pledges Romney is making) seemed to be east Asia's verdict. Well, maybe.</p> <p>I'd still say it matters quite a lot. Romney may plan to govern from the centre if he becomes president and Republican forces in Congress and the country allow him to \u2013 as they denied much scope to Obama. But it is certainly not what he's been saying.</p> <p>On climate change, denial is dominant. Republicans still want to deport millions of illegal immigrants, they would cut spending on benefits for those layabout Democrats \u2013 healthcare and stuff \u2013 while increasing defence spending AND cutting taxes for everyone. A constitutional curb on gays rights, the outlawing of abortion etc etc.</p> <p>A pre-emptive attack on Iran's nuclear plants, support for more West Bank settlements, the list is a long one \u2013 and scary. What we know from the record, two Bushes and Ronald Reagan, is that Republicans are better at cutting taxes, mostly for the rich, than cutting spending the way they promise to cut it. That's why the US has a crippling debt problem, a more serious budget imbalance than our own, possible only because of the residual prestige (for now) of the dollar.</p> <p>Add all that to the superior organisational power of the Democratic machine \u2013 the Obama team's better grasp of social media as campaign tools that offset the billionaire bank-rolling of Romney \u2013 together with the changing demographics of the US, and it points me to the same conclusion.</p> <p>Obama's crowds are much smaller than in 2008, but they're multiracial. That's America's future, black, white, Hispanic, Asian. Indeed the insurgency of the Tea Party, which was forced to settle for Romney (Paul Ryan, a consolation prize who could prove an error), may be the last hurrah of the old all-white hegemony.</p> <p>If they can't beat a disappointing incumbent, they may have to come to terms with the new realities at home and abroad. Modernisation of the Republican party is long overdue. Obama to scrape home after all.</p>",
  "<p>For a moment it felt like 2008 all over again: Barack Obama on stage with fire in his belly promising hope and change to thousands of euphoric supporters.</p> <p>The president came to the Democratic bastion of Boulder, Colorado, on Thursday night to recapture the old magic, and with the help of 10,000 cheering fans he partially succeeded.</p> <p>Instead of savaging Mitt Romney, the longer-than-usual 37-minute speech \u2013 part of a last-ditch, all-out drive to win Colorado \u2013 focused on uplifting rhetoric and optimism about the future.</p> <p>\"We've come too far to grow faint-hearted!\" he told the capacity crowd at the Coors Event Center at the University of Colorado. \"Now's the time to keep pushing forward!\" Ordinary people needed a champion in Washington and he was that champion, Obama said, drawing whoops and cheers.</p> <p>\"We need an agenda that recognizes that we don't just look out for ourselves, we look out for one another. I ran because the voices of the American people, your voices, had been shut out of American politics for way too long.\"</p> <p>Economic woe, political gridlock and shorn ambition have turned the shiny candidate of 2008 into a crumpled incumbent but the speech, following the mood of unity and bipartisanship engendered by superstorm Sandy, reclaimed Obama's old rhetoric of hope and change. Days earlier Romney sought to appropriate the slogans.</p> <p>\"He's saying he's the candidate of change,\" said Obama. \"Let me tell you Colorado, we know what change looks like. Let me tell you, what governor Romney is offering sure ain't it.\"</p> <p>The president cast the race as a choice between the sunlit uplands of Bill Clinton-style job creation and fiscal surpluses or the dark valleys of George Bush-style crisis and crash.</p> <p>\"We've tested both visions. One worked really well, one worked really badly.\"</p> <p>A mostly young audience in a liberal heartland was a safe forum to reintroduce the rhetorically soaring candidate of yore but Obama, his voice hoarse, acknowledged he was no longer quite the same man.</p> <p>\"After four years as president you know me by now. You may not agree with every decision I make, or be frustrated with the pace of change.\" The crowd chanted back: \"Four more years.\" Obama continued. \"I know what real change looks like because I fought for it.

  "<p>The leader of the newly launched airports commission has countered claims that his inquiry will serve as a political delaying tactic by pledging to offer practical answers by next year, well before the next general election.</p> <p>The commission is charged with examining \"the scale and timing of any requirement for additional [aviation] capacity\", according to its terms of reference released on Friday. It will produce its final report in June 2015, a month after the election, but Sir Howard Davies, who is leading the inquiry, said its interim report in 2013 would narrow down the options for airport expansion to those it considered feasible.</p> <p>\"The experience of recent years shows we need a robust evidence base which has the support of a broad consensus of opinion,\" Davies said. He has pledged to provide an open-minded assessment of the business and environmental cases for and against airport expansion.</p> <p>Davies admitted he was highly aware of criticisms that his review would be \"booting into the long grass\" what has become a toxic political issue, and promised to deliver full, feasible solutions ready for implementation \u2013 including producing short-term options for expanding aviation capacity in the south-east in his interim report.</p> <p>Earlier, Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/02/boris-johnson-airport-expansion-slow\" title=\"\">criticised the commission as too slow</a> and described it as a \"policy of utter inertia\".</p> <p>Davies said by next year he would have given feasible options for any measures short of runway expansion, which is ruled out in the current coalition agreement. His interim report will narrow down the options for airport expansion to those the commission believes are workable, potentially refocusing the debate on Heathrow versus a new four-runway hub airport \u2013 the mayor's preferring solution \u2013 before the election.</p> <p>The transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, announcing the commission's terms of reference and which academics and aviation experts would be assisting Davies, said: \"Aviation is vital to the UK economy and we need to have a long-term aviation policy which meets the challenges of the future. Sir Howard and his team will now take forward this vitally important work for the government and bring a much-needed fresh perspective to the debate.\"</p> <p>Davies said his team, who between them have worked on delivering the Olympics, managed airports and sat on key environmental bodies, had the range of skills and experience required. \"With open minds, we will take time to explore the evidence, consider the options and aim to develop a lasting solution to the nation's aviation needs,\" he said. \"Our ambition is to do a thorough piece of work that will ensure aviation continues to support this country's economic, social and environmental ambitions. We aim to put the next government into a position in which rapid and implementable decisions can be soundly made.\"</p> <p>The other five commissioners are Sir John Armitt, former chairman of the Olympic Delivery Authority and former chief executive of Network Rail; Ricky Burdett, professor of urban studies at the London School of Economics; Vivienne Cox, former CEO and executive vice-president of BP Alternative Energy; Dame Julia King, vice-chancellor of Aston University and a member of the Committee on Climate Change; and Geoff Muirhead, the former CEO of the Manchester Airport Group.</p> <p>The government said the commission would \"examine the scale and timing of any requirement for additional capacity to maintain the UK's position as Europe's most important aviation hub; and it will identify and evaluate how any need for additional capacity should be met in the short, medium and long term\".</p> <p>Davies seemed to implicitly accept an underlying need for new capacity, but he has pledged to examine all the evidence, including Department for Transport forecasts for passenger growth that underpin the debate.</p> <p>A spokesman for Heathrow, whose planned third runway was cancelled by the coalition government in 2010, said: \"We hope the Davies commission will build consensus on the UK's requirements for hub capacity and then rigorously assess every option against those needs. None of the options for hub airport capacity is easy. Every choice, including doing nothing, has its consequences.\"</p> <p>Gatwick airport said it would be submitting full plans to Davies for building its second runway.</p> <p>Despite Davies's pledge to advance the timetable as much as he could within the current political constraints, business groups urged the government to let him report sooner. Corin Taylor, of the Institute of Directors, said: \"Sir Howard Davies is obviously doing the best he can with the hand he was dealt, but it seems that the commission will have solid conclusions based on extensive research ready well before 2015. Business needs to know what they are as soon as possible.\"</p>",
  "<p>The following interesting question arose yesterday from what at first appeared to be some petty Twitter bickering: who was the worst president for civil liberties in US history? That question is a difficult one to answer because it is so reliant upon which of many valid standards of measurement one chooses; it depends at least as much on the specific rights which one understands the phrase \"civil liberties\" to encompass. That makes the question irresolvable in any definitive way, but its examination is nonetheless valuable for the light it sheds on current political disputes.</p> <p>It's worthwhile first to set forth the context in which the question arose. At their Lawfare blog, Ritika Singh and Benjamin Wittes <a href=\"http://www.lawfareblog.com/2012/10/civil-liberties-in-the-war-of-1812/\">posted an excerpt</a> of an essay they wrote for a new book on the War of 1812; their essay pertains to the impact of that war on civil liberties and executive power. The two Brookings writers note that despite intense domestic opposition to the war, President Madison \"eschewed the authority to detain American citizens in military custody or try them in military tribunals, and more generally, declined to undertake the sorts of executive overreaches we have come to expect - and even encourage - from our presidents in war.\" </p> <p>After Julian Sanchez, I and others tweeted that essay by remarking that Madison refrained from exploiting the war to abridge civil liberties, Slate's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/264005363010002945\">Matt Yglesias' wrote</a>:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398788006\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/2/1351853066074/yglesias.png\" alt=\"yglesias tweet\" width=\"360\" height=\"205\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>That struck me as a cheap and vapid reply. Nobody was suggesting that Madison was the personification of civil liberties nirvana. Rather, the point was a very narrow and discrete one: he largely refrained from exploiting the War of 1812 as a pretext for abridging extant political rights. Whether he owned slaves - or was otherwise the worst monster in history - does not remotely pertain to, let alone negate, that specific and important historical fact about Madison's presidency.</p> <p>Moreover, the issue raised by the essay on Madison was about the extent to which presidents use their power to erode civil liberties which exist when they assumed the office, or refrain from attacking those rights despite having the opportunity in the form of war or other crises. That a person is born into a society in which the evil of slavery already exists has little to do with that historical question.</p> <p>That said, once one posits a president's personal slavery ownership as inconsistent with a positive civil liberties record - as Yglesias implicitly did - then that must be the number one factor in assessing a president's place on the civil liberties list. By that metric, all slave-owning presidents, or one who <a href=\"http://billofrightsinstitute.org/resources/educator-resources/lessons-plans/presidents/dred-scott/\">expressly endorsed the Dred Scott decision as James Buchanan did</a>, would automatically have to be deemed the worst.</p> <p>After all, owning human beings as chattel is the supreme civil liberties violation, by far the gravest civil liberties abuse in US history. That goes without saying. It is sui generis.</p> <p>That's why it was so bizarre to see that the very same Matt Yglesias, just moments later, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/264006669296615425\">pronounced Woodrow Wilson</a> - a president who never owned any slaves and never presided over slavery - to be the \"worst-ever president on civil liberties\", even suggesting that Wilson has no \"serious competition\" for that ignominious title. It was when I pointed out the irony of Yglesias' selection of a non-slave-owning president in light of his tweet that the interesting question arose of who should be considered the worst civil liberties president in US history.</p> <p>If one were simply to consider specific acts which constituted grave assaults on civil liberties - narrowly defined as the core political rights explicitly protected by the Bill of Rights: free speech, freedom from deprivation of life and liberty without due process, etc. - one could make a strong argument for several presidents. John Adams <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/Alien.html\">signed The Alien and Sedition Acts</a>, which essentially criminalized certain forms of government criticism in preparation for a war with France, a radical assault on the First Amendment. </p> <p>Abraham Lincoln <a href=\"http://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jala/2629860.0029.205?rgn=main;view=fulltext\">illegally suspended the core liberty of habeas corpus</a> without Congressional approval. Wilson's <a href=\"http://www.chicora.org/woodrow-wilson.html\">attacks on basic free speech in the name of national security</a> were indeed legion and probably unparalleled. Franklin Roosevelt <a href=\"http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/roosevelt-ushers-in-japanese-american-internment\">oversaw the due-process-free internment</a> of more than 100,000 law-abiding Japanese-Americans into concentration camps.</p> <p>And then there are the two War on Terror presidents. George Bush seized on the 9/11 attack to usher in radical new surveillance and detention powers in the PATRIOT ACT, spied for years on the communications of US citizens without the warrants required by law, and claimed the power to indefinitely imprison even US citizens without charges in military brigs. </p> <p>His successor, Barack Obama, went further by claiming the power <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2012/01/02/president-obama-signed-the-national-defense-authorization-act-now-what/\">not merely to detain citizens without judicial review</a> but <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/04/07/assassinations_2/\">to assassinate them</a> (about which <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/world/middleeast/07yemen.html?hp&amp;_r=0\">the New York Times said</a>: \"It is extremely rare, if not unprecedented, for an American to be approved for targeted killing\"). He has waged an unprecedented war on whistleblowers, dusting off Wilson's Espionage Act of 1917 to prosecute more then double the number of whistleblowers than all prior presidents combined. And he has draped his actions with at least as much secrecy, if not more so, than any president in US history.</p> <p>Ultimately, it is close to impossible to rank these abuses strictly as a qualitative matter, in terms of the powers seized. How does one say that interning citizens in concentration camps (Roosevelt) is better or worse than imprisoning people for dissent (Adams and Wilson), putting people in cages with no charges (Lincoln, Bush, Obama), or claiming the power to execute citizens in total secrecy and without any checks of any kind (Obama)? If anything, one could reasonably argue that the power of due-process-free executions is the most menacing since it's the only act that is permanent and irreversible.</p> <p>Certainly, the quantity of abuse matters. In that regard, Roosevelt's interments and Wilson's free speech prosecutions would appear worse than, say, Adams' attacks on dissent, Bush's indefinite detentions, or Obama's citizen assassinations. </p> <p>Moreover, it is one of the ironies of US history that <a href=\"http://hnn.us/articles/19113.html\">civil liberties erosions are often accompanied by civil liberties progress from the same leader</a>: Adams was integral in the founding of the republic and its rights-enshrining documents; Lincoln freed the slaves; Wilson supported women's suffrage; Roosevelt appointed two of the most sterling civil liberties advocates to the supreme court; Obama withdrew authorization for some torture techniques (ones that were not in use when he was inaugurated) and banned CIA black sites (ones that were empty when he assumed office). </p> <p>Ultimately, there are two critical factors that, for me at least, are highly influential if not decisive in determining the proper ranking. The first is the extent to which the civil liberties abuses are <strong>temporary or permanent</strong>.</p> <p>Most of the contenders for worst civil liberties abuses were \"justified\" by traditional wars that had a finite end and thus dissipated once the wars were over. Lincoln's habeas suspension did not survive the end of the Civil War, nor did FDR's internment camps survive the end of World War II. The Alien and Sedition Acts were severely diluted fairly quickly, while the bulk of Wilson's abuses which survived World War I lay dormant until the War on Terror. As horrible as they were, these radical erosions were often finite, arguably by design, since the wars which served as their pretext would foreseeably end at some point.</p> <p>This is one key factor that distinguishes the War on Terror. By its nature, it will never end, at least not in the foreseeable future. It is a \"war\" far more in a metaphorical sense than a real one. </p> <p>Since it began, both administrations who have waged it have expressly acknowledged its virtually indefinite - and thus unique - nature. In May 2009, when <a href=\"http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article22688.htm\">Obama unveiled his proposal</a> for \"preventive detention\", <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/21/us/politics/21obama.text.html?_r=0\">he said</a>: \"Unlike the Civil War or World War II, we can't count on a surrender ceremony to bring this journey to an end.\" He added that we'll still be fighting this war \"a year from now, five years from now, and - in all probability - 10 years from now.\" </p> <p>Just last week, the Washington Post <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/24/obama-terrorism-kill-list\">reported</a> that the Obama administration is creating permanent bureaucratic systems to implement its War on Terror powers as it \"expects to continue adding names to kill or capture lists for years\". Specifically, \"among senior Obama administration officials, there is broad consensus that such operations are likely to be extended at least another decade.\" That \"suggests that the United States has reached only the midpoint of what was once known as the global war on terrorism.\"</p> <p>Civil liberties abuses justified by a finite war can be awful while they last, but then they cease. Abuses that are systematized based on the premise that they are to be permanent do far more than that: they radically alter the nature of the government and the relationship of the political class to the citizenry. </p> <p>This, to me, has always been the most uniquely pernicious aspect of the War on Terror civil liberties assaults of the last decade: they will not end when the \"war\" does because the \"war\" will have no end. Each new power is embedded permanently into the political framework, incrementally transforming the political culture and the species of government itself.</p> <p>The second vital factor is the<strong> justification used</strong> for these assaults. However critical one wants to be of Lincoln, Wilson and Roosevelt - and harsh criticism is appropriate in all three cases - they were actually fighting major wars that had the potential to severely harm if not destroy the US. To the extent that war is a justification for increasing the powers of the executive, those three wars are clearly the most compelling examples.</p> <p>By contrast, the \"War on Terror\" is not even legitimately described as a \"war\", let alone one anywhere near the magnitude of its predecessors. Shortly after I began writing about politics in late 2005, I <a href=\"http://glenngreenwald.blogspot.com.br/2005/12/idiotic-and-revealing-civil-war.html\">examined the inane tactic</a> of Bush-following neoconservatives - one that is, like so many neocon views, now vigorously embraced by many Obama defenders - to cite Lincoln's civil liberties abridgments during the Civil War to justify abridgments in the name of the War on Terror. The fundamental differences are obvious:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"During Lincoln's Presidency, the entire nation was engulfed in an internal, all-out war. Half of the country was fully devoted to the destruction of the other half. The existence of the nation was very much in doubt. Americans were dying violent deaths every day at a staggering rate. One million American were wounded and a half-million Americans died (a total which represented 5% of the total population), making it the deadliest war America has ever faced, by far, including all wars through the present. On multiple occasions, more than 25,000 Americans \u2013 and sometimes as many as 50,000 \u2013 were killed in battles lasting no more than three days. The scope of carnage, killing, and chaos \u2013 all within the country, on American soil \u2013 is difficult to comprehend.</p> <p>\"Making matters worse \u2013 much worse \u2013 the country was only 70 years old at the time. And even before the Civil War began, America was teetering precariously from these unresolved internal conflicts. The country then was a shadow of what it is today, with a tiny faction of the strength, stability and cohesion which, 140 years later, characterize the United States.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>It takes little effort to demonstrate that the \"War on Terror\" is not in the same universe. As Professor Richard Jackson has <a href=\"http://richardjacksonterrorismblog.wordpress.com/2011/05/25/the-threat-of-terrorism/\">documented</a>, there is a greater risk of dying from lightning strikes or bathtub falls than terrorism. Professors John Mueller and Mark G. Stewart, writing <a href=\"http://politicalscience.osu.edu/faculty/jmueller//absisfin.pdf\">in the latest issue of International Security</a>, condemned the \"extraordinarily exaggerated and essentially delusional response\" to 9/11. As Professor Stephen Walt <a href=\"http://walt.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/08/13/what_terrorist_threat#.UClvYIJhDFA.twitter\">described their article</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>\"Mueller and Stewart analyze 50 cases of supposed 'Islamic terrorist plots' against the United States, and show how virtually all of the perpetrators were (in their words) 'incompetent, ineffective, unintelligent, idiotic, ignorant, unorganized, misguided, muddled, amateurish, dopey, unrealistic, moronic, irrational and foolish.' They quote former Glenn Carle, former deputy national intelligence officer for transnational threats saying 'we must see jihadists for the small, lethal, disjointed and miserable opponents that they are,' noting further that al-Qaida's 'capabilities are far inferior to its desires.'\" </p> </blockquote> <p>To the extent the validity of the proffered justification matters, and it must matter some, the War on Terror abuses are easily the worst for this metric. Unlike the actual, threatening wars of the past, this \"war\" is pure pretext, a total farce: so out of proportion to the civil liberties assaults employed in its name as to be inconceivable.</p> <p>As noted, this discussion assumes a rather narrow range of the term \"civil liberties\": namely a focus on the original core political liberties expressly guaranteed by the Bill of Rights: freedom of speech, freedom from deprivation of life and liberty without due process, habeas corpus. If one expands the term to include more contemporary debates surrounding issues such as gay equality and reproductive rights, as is proper, then the overall picture meaningfully changes.</p> <p>The one common strain running through these historic civil liberties assaults is war. War almost always erodes political liberties. That has always been true. Cicero <a href=\"http://liberalwarjournal.blogspot.com.br/2006/01/inter-arma-enim-silent-leges_10.html\">famously observed</a> \"inter arma, enim silent leges\" (in times of war, the law falls mute). </p> <p>That fact - that wars maximize a political leader's power - is a key reason they often crave war and why wars, under the Constitution, were supposed to be extremely difficult for presidents to start. As John Jay <a href=\"http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed04.asp\">wrote in Federalist 4</a>, \"absolute monarchs will often make war when their nations are to get nothing by it, but for the purposes and objects merely personal\" (that's also why the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obamas-negation-of-hostilities-in-libya-draws-criticism/2011/06/20/AGV2zTdH_story.html\">absurd contortions</a> invoked by President Obama to fight a war in Libya not only in the absence of Congressional approval, but in the face of <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-250_162-20073996.html\">formal Congressional disapproval</a>, belongs high on the list of his worst and likely most enduring civil liberties assaults).</p> <p>But in terms of the role played by war in enabling civil liberties assaults, at least the exploited wars are usually real. In the case of the \"War on Terror\", it is far more illusory and frivolous than real. That - along with their permanence - is a major factor in determining where the civil liberties erosions of the last decade, and the presidents responsible for them, rank in history.</p>",
  "<p>Could the backing of Barack Obama by the mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg be \"the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theduncanclark/statuses/264126160504492032\">most important news story</a> of all time\"? Was the \"Frankenstorm\" Sandy the disaster some, including <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/25/climate-change-david-attenborough\">David Attenborough this week</a>, believed was unfortunately necessary to wake the US and the world from its slumber over global warming?</p> <p>It has certainly <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/nov/01/bloomberg-climate-change-closet-romney?intcmp=239\">resurrected the issue in the US</a>, as my colleague there Suzanne Goldenberg reports, and has broken the extraordinary <a href=\" http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/nov/01/obama-strategy-silence-climate-change\">climate silence Obama instigated in the spring of 2009</a> - having decided that climate change was not a winning issue for him. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gallery/2012/oct/30/superstorm-sandy-new-york-in-pictures\">devastation of New York and New Jersey</a> has changed that and Bloomberg's intervention is certainly striking. His <a href=\"http://www.mikebloomberg.com/index.cfm?objectid=BD2B64EB-C29C-7CA2-F83198E3B4EF0938\">endorsement was headlined</a> \"Vote for a president who will lead on climate change\", while his <a href=\"http://news.wsiu.org/post/bloomberg-businessweeks-cover-its-global-warming-stupid\">Business Week magazine cover</a> was ever starker: \"It's climate change, stupid.\"</p> <p>However, people suggested hurricane Katrina in 2005 would galvanise climate action and it clearly did not. On our current trend of greenhouse gas emissions, the world is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/apr/25/governments-catastrophic-climate-change-iea\">on track for 6C of warming</a>, i.e. catastrophe. Other natural disasters, droughts, floods and storms all supercharged by climate change, have struck across the world since and caused far more human suffering than Sandy. </p> <p>But what has changed is two things. First, this latest disaster has struck the most famous city on Earth at the moment it is electing the most powerful person on the planet. Second, the 2007 report from the UN's climate scientists and everything since has built an incontrovertible case that the burning of fossil fuels is a severe threat to the benign climate that has prevailed for millennia.</p> <p>The reason why Bloomberg's backing for Obama will, I think, resonate beyond the US election is that it strikes at the very heart of the inaction on climate change: the lack of political will. The low-carbon technology exists to tackle the problem, as does the clear economic case for doing so. What was missing was, as Bloomberg put it, the desire to \"place scientific evidence and risk management above electoral politics\".</p> <p>The shock of Bloomberg's endorsement for Obama is clear: the mayor was elected as a Republican before becoming an independent. It's a little like London mayor and Conservative Boris Johnson backing Labour leader Ed Milliband for prime minister in the wake of the capital flooding. Some might even think that Bloomberg's attack on Mitt Romney for \"reversing course\" on climate change action could apply to David Cameron, who has indulged in his own <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/apr/24/cameron-green-speech-clean-energy\">politically convenient climate silence</a> since being elected.</p> <p>Only time will reveal the ultimate significance of Bloomberg's choice. But the US has been a huge barrier to international progress on dealing with climate change. </p> <p>If Sandy \u2013 and this summer's record US heatwave \u2013 end up blowing Obama back into the White House with enough wind in his sails to persuade him to make climate change a winning issue, it really could have positive global consequences. If not, I shudder to think what scale of apocalyptic disaster will be needed to destroy the political cowardice among world leaders that is stoking the ever greater climate change storms of the future.</p>",

  "<p>Barack Obama says Omar Little is his favourite character in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/wire\" title=\"\">The Wire</a>, which automatically makes the man who played him, Michael Kenneth Williams, an expert on attitude. Add to this the fact that he used to dance for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/madonna\" title=\"\">Madonna</a> and George Michael in huge MC Hammer trousers, is about to star in the 2013 remake of RoboCop, and is back on our screens as the icy Chalky in the third season of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/boardwalk-empire\" title=\"\">Boardwalk Empire</a>, and you have an authority on the fine art of being a badass. Here are his top tips\u2026</p> <h2>Learn to bust a move</h2> <p>\"People misconstrue when I say I was a dancer. I was not classically trained. I was a street dancer, and I got to do what I did in the nightclubs of New York City. I came to London to perform at Ministry Of Sound and Heaven, and I was on Top Of The Pops with Crystal Waters. I'm a kid from the streets of Brooklyn who got paid to travel the world.\"</p> <h2>Use your head</h2> <p>\"My neighbourhood was heavily migrated by the West Indian and Caribbean community. It was a very violent neighbourhood, a lot of murder, a lot of drugs, and I fell prey to some of that. It wasn't until the arts found me that I found something that I could grasp, something I was good at that held my attention. The arts saved my life.\"</p> <h2>Make your scare work for you</h2> <p>\"I didn't used to think the scar was at all cool. I got it on my 25th birthday in a barroom brawl in New York City. I'd been drinking, and I got involved in something I would have normally ignored. I got what I got. People tell me that it's cool, but that didn't come overnight. It took me a long time to be able to look at myself in the mirror. I had to look past what I saw into what I felt inside.\"</p> <h2>Get the Prez onside</h2> <p>\"Doing something that warrants the attention of the President of the United States is super-cool. The Wire is very realistic and based on real events. Not only did he watch it, he enjoyed it, and publicly said that my character struck a chord, which led me to believe that he hasn't forgot about us in the 'hood. He has to worry about the whole country: rich, poor and inbetween. It shows he has his finger on the pulse and knows what's happening on the streets.\"</p> <h2>Get gangster approval</h2> <p>\"I'd been concerned about how my community were willing to receive me playing such an openly gay character. It works because Omar doesn't apologise for who he is, he doesn't try to hide it. He's a standard dude with morals and a code. That was one of the things that Obama loved about him, that he lives by his codes. That's all we want to be around: real people. We may not agree with each other's lifestyles, but if a person is upfront about who they are, they gain respect.\"</p> <h2>Embrace social mobility</h2> <p>\"You can really expect the friendship between Chalky and Lucky to be tested this season. Chalky has had to change with the times. He's still fighting for his community and his family, but he's moving in a whole new circle. Will Chalky be loyal to his morals and his code, or will he join the direction the city is moving in? There's a lot of tests going on.\"</p> <h2>Stick to your guns</h2> <p>\"There are difference in the ways Omar and Chalky deal with a life of crime, and it's a key aspect of their personalities. Omar is very upfront. He only robs from others in the game. Chalky is a businessman, so he runs for profit. With Omar, you're thinking, 'Will he cross this line?' but he doesn't care so much about what others think, and that shows in the way he behaves. Chalky does care; he's a criminal, a gangster and a businessman. So if he crosses the line, he'll use this as leverage to further himself.\"</p> <h2>Get a robot for a best mate</h2> <p>\"I play RoboCop's partner on the police force. I help him adjust to turning from a human to a robot. I'm in such great company: Samuel L Jackson, Gary Oldman, Michael Keaton. Every day I think, 'Holy shit!' I'm star-struck. It's going to be great being in a summer blockbuster. It's a first for me.\"</p> <h2>Learn God Save The Queen</h2> <p>\"I'll give a shout-out to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/stephen-graham\" title=\"\">Stephen Graham</a> [Al Capone in Boardwalk Empire], Michael Fassbender [Edwin Epps in Twelve Years A Slave], <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/dominic-west\" title=\"\">Dominic West</a> [Jimmy McNulty in The Wire], <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/steve-mcqueen\" title=\"\">Steve McQueen</a> [director of Twelve Years] and James Purefoy [Teddy Rist in 2009 TV series The Philanthropist]. I am the black man in the Brit pack and they are my Brit brothers.\"</p>",
  "<p>An overwhelming majority of Israelis entitled to vote in the US presidential election have cast their ballot for Mitt Romney, according to a poll conducted by an organisation aimed at maximising turnout.</p> <p>Eighty-five percent of the 80,000 American-Israelis who registered to vote through <a href=\"http://ivoteisrael.com/\" title=\"\">iVoteIsrael</a> backed the Republican candidate, the survey indicated. The organisation claimed that in states where the race is tight, expatriate voters from Israel could make a significant difference. Around 7,500 Israelis are registered to vote in Florida, and 3,500 in Ohio.</p> <p>But <a href=\"http://www.democratsabroad.org/group/israel\" title=\"\">Democrats Abroad Israel</a> dismissed the poll as \"slanted and extremely partial\" because it was based on surveys carried out only at polling stations set up by iVoteIsrael. The acting chairman Hillel Schenker told the Israeli newspaper Haaretz: \"All they're doing is providing information about the people they polled at their polling stations, in places where there are predominantly Orthodox and rightwing Jews.\"</p> <p>The campaign group says it is non-partisan and its only interest is to maximise the vote among eligible Israelis. It said voter participation had quadrupled from the 20,000 Israelis who voted in 2008, and that between 20% and 25% of all overseas votes this year would come from Israel.</p> <p>Israel's prime minster, Binyamin Netanyahu, has been accused of favouring a Romney victory in next week's election. Relations between Netanyahu and Barack Obama have been severely strained over the issue of the Iranian nuclear programme. Romney is perceived to be more sympathetic to Netanyahu's view that military action may be needed to halt the programme.</p> <p>Romney has consistently sought to portray Obama as failing to maintain the traditionally close ties between the US and Israel. Almost eight in 10 Jewish Americans voted for Obama in 2008, and a majority are expected to vote Democrat in this election.</p>",
  "<p>Confetti still litters the floor of the modest campaign headquarters and the victorious candidate is obviously exhausted, but for Maya Fern\u00e1ndez Allende the real hard work is just about to begin.</p> <p>Allende was just one year old on 11 September 1973 when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/sep/12/from-the-guardian-archive?INTCMP=SRCH.\" title=\"\">a rightwing coup d'etat</a> led to the death of her grandfather \u2013 Salvador Allende, the then Chilean president. The family fled to Cuba and for three decades the heir to one of Chile's most illustrious and controversial political fortunes was out of the limelight.</p> <p>All that changed last Sunday, when Fern\u00e1ndez Allende <a href=\"http://www.nunoa.cl/conozca/\" title=\"\">won the mayorship of \u00d1u\u00f1oa</a> \u2013 a district of the capital, Santiago. But in addition to the pressures of office will come the pressure of assuming the Allende legacy.</p> <p>\"It makes me proud but [is also] a responsibility,\" she told the Guardian. \"My grandfather was a grand man, he was loyal with his people until the end \u2026 that is a principle, a value that is not often seen in politics.\"</p> <p>A week ago, Fern\u00e1ndez Allende's victory was not even discussed as a possibility, as the district had long been held by rightwing politicians. Her opponent Pedro Sabat had been re-elected three times by wide margins and held office for 16 years.</p> <p>But Chile has undergone a transformation over the past 18 months. Citizen groups fighting hydroelectric dams in Patagonia and demanding free university education have sprouted online and filled the streets with dozens of big marches \u2013 gathering up to 150,000 students. The upshot was the narrowest of wins for the challenger \u2014 by less than 100 votes out of more than 75,000 cast.</p> <p>Fern\u00e1ndez Allende put her victory down to a longstanding family tradition: hitting the streets. \"I walked the entire district twice,\" she said as a steady stream of giddy volunteers entered and left the one-storey, four-room office.</p> <p>\"When you enter a campaign, you enter to win, not to make a decent stand \u2026 I put all my heart into this and it was difficult, versus a mayor who had high voting support, but even before the final announcement I felt it was a victory, nobody had even come close to being that competitive with Sabat. We did this with a team, with a field operation.\"</p> <p>Students battled regularly with Sabat by occupying his office and shutting down numerous schools with strikes that lasted for as long as six months. Sabat faced strong condemnation for his assessment that a high school seized by female students had degenerated into \"a whorehouse\".</p> <p>Fern\u00e1ndez Allende said: \"That comment really shook people up. Even people who did not support the [striking] students thought that was too much.\"</p> <p>Apart from a whiteboard, the only office decoration was the official photograph of Salvador Allende wearing the Chilean presidential sash and his trademark thick black glasses. \"I would have loved to have known him in a more humane way, as a grandfather,\" said Fern\u00e1ndez Allende.</p> <p>\"I don't remember him, I was too small. But I am always entertained by the stories of his life that people tell me. Especially that despite his huge responsibilities, he had a great sense of humour. Always [there] with a wisecrack. That kept him going.\"</p> <p>Fern\u00e1ndez Allende, who lived in Cuba for nearly 20 years, added: \"The political bug bit me late in life.\" Even upon her return to Chile in 1992, she did little on the political front besides joining the Socialist party. But in 2008, she won her first election as a <em>concejal</em>, or neighbourhood representative, who works closely with the mayor.</p> <p>She also began to tap into the vein of goodwill still held by her grandfather and was elected to the Socialist party central committee in 2010. But it was the sudden outpouring of anger on the street that really galvanised her career \u2013 a sign that her grandfather's legacy of a humane socialist revolution lived on.</p> <p>\"The dictatorship did not allow you to express yourself, you might talk and then be disappeared, so people stopped talking,\" Fern\u00e1ndez Allende said. \"For 20 years nobody talked to anybody, you did not know who was a spy. There was lots of silence. People became more introverted. [Now] this generation has changed, it has come back to the street, to knock on the door, to bang the table.\"</p>",
  "<p>It cannot be called an uprising. Nor do demonstrators demand regime change. The dispute is narrowly about preventing a change in the electoral law that would disenfranchise voters. Nevertheless, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/23/kuwait-bans-gatherings-20-protests\" title=\"\">demonstrations taking place in Kuwait</a> are real enough. Tens of thousands, a number unheard of in Kuwait, took part in a \"march of dignity\" and a further mass protest is <a href=\"http://www.arabtimesonline.com/NewsDetails/tabid/96/smid/414/ArticleID/189354/reftab/36/Default.aspx\" title=\"\">planned for Sunday</a> despite an announced ban on public gatherings of more than 20 people. The wave of demands for democratic change, which Saudi Arabia fervently hoped had come to a crashing halt with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/25/syria-civil-war-aleppo-checkpoints-torture\" title=\"\">the civil war in Syria</a>, is now lapping around the feet of the Gulf states.</p> <p>That Kuwait should give rise to such scenes is, on the face of it, a surprise. It is not only one of the wealthiest oil producers in the region, but a state with a raucous parliament to which the current emir, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, partly owes his position. A former foreign minister, Sabah was not the crown prince <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jan/16/brianwhitaker.mainsection\" title=\"\">when the then emir, Sheikh Jaber, died in 2006</a>. The death created a dynastic crisis, as the crown prince <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jan/25/brianwhitaker.mainsection?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">Sheikh Sa'ad was too ill to take the oath</a>. Sa'ad abdicated and Sabah took over, but by the time the abdication came through Kuwait's parliament had already voted Sa'ad out of office.</p> <p>The new emir was the victor of a power struggle within the ruling family, but he was also the popular choice. This point is not lost on today's parliamentarians, who say that, as they backed him, the emir owes them one. It also accounts for the proprietary tone of the slogan: \"We will not let you\" [take Kuwait into the abyss of autocracy].</p> <p>There are other factors that make Kuwait different. There is no Sunni-Shia divide in this state. In fact, relations between the Sunni state and Iran are by custom and practice stable. So <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/20/bahraini-uprising-iran\" title=\"\">unlike Bahrain</a>, no one can blame Iran for fomenting unrest. Instead, the Kuwaiti authorities have been forced to look elsewhere for the source of their troubles.</p> <p>With the exception of Qatar, the Gulf states are now openly blaming <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/24/muslim-brotherhood-egypt-president-mohamed-morsi\" title=\"\">Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood</a> as the source of their domestic woes. After the \"dignity\" demonstration, the Kuwaiti government said they were looking for three members of the Brotherhood. Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates, which has locked up 64 members of a local Islamist group al-Islah, claims that <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/gulf-states-must-tackle-muslim-brotherhood-threat-uae-164546200.html\">the brothers were plotting to undermine governments in the region</a>. The Brotherhood is now on the agenda of the next meeting of the Gulf co-operation council.</p> <p>Blaming Egyptian Islamists for trouble at home is a high-risk strategy. If Egypt pulls through, it is a doomed one. It risks local unity \u2013 Qatar is a major financial backer of both Egypt and Tunisia. It invites the very comparison with corrupt dictators of the Arab republicans, that the monarchs of the Gulf were so anxious to avoid. By portraying Islamism as an outside force, it guarantees it added credibility as an internal one.</p> <p>Islamists, whether Brotherhood or Salafi, are only part of the opposition in Kuwait. Youth groups, nationalists, liberals are all in this too. The arrest of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middle-east-live/2012/oct/30/syria-conflict-after-failed-ceasefire-live#block-508fa29d95cb55519dae8b4f\" title=\"\">Musallam al-Barrak</a>, a former lawmaker and union leader, has done more to galvanise the opposition than anything else. An independent nationalist, at the last elections Barrack garnered around 30,000 votes, the highest number in Kuwait. To declare him the plaything of foreign power is political folly. He has now been <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20165318\" title=\"\">released on bail</a>.</p> <p>The source of the ferment in Kuwait has little to do with Islamism. It is an amendment to the electoral law pushed by the emir that would reduce the number of votes each voter cast to one. With multiseat constituencies, this would mean that, as in Jordan, if the opposition candidate got 70% of the vote, the remainder of the vote would be divided up among the other seats for the same constituency. This would pave the way for a neutered parliament in which the opposition could never take control. It is blatantly undemocratic but it is non-negotiable.</p> <p>The emir is, however, going full-steam ahead with an election on 1 December on this basis, which the opposition has now said it will boycott. The ferment in the Gulf undermines the thesis that the movement known as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2011/mar/22/middle-east-protest-interactive-timeline\" title=\"\">Arab spring</a> is primarily about poverty. It defies too the prediction that it has run into the sands of sectarian divides between Sunni and Shia. The Gulf rulers thought they could buy immunity from this change but they have found that dignity is not something that even their unlimited quantity of petrodollars can buy. All eyes are now looking nervously on Kuwait.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 20 November 2012. The original said that Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates, used his address to the United Nations to claim that the Muslim Brotherhood were plotting to undermine governments in the region. He made this claim after his address to the UN. This has been corrected.</p>",

  "<p>The impact of the superstorm Sandy was felt directly on the presidential election on Thursday when the popular mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, threw his support behind Barack Obama, citing Republican challenger Mitt Romney's failure to back climate change measures.</p> <p>Bloomberg combined his endorsement of Obama with a devastating attack on Romney for reversing his positions not only on climate change but on immigration, guns, abortion rights and healthcare.</p> <p>His endorsement came as Obama received plaudits for his handling of the storm that has devastated New Jersey and New York and also hit Connecticut and West Virginia.</p> <p>The mayor, writing about the damage caused to New York by Sandy, praised Obama for having made some progress towards tackling climate change. He noted that Romney, too, had supported climate change moves in the past but has since backed away from them.</p> <p>In a powerful passage that can only hurt Romney, Bloomberg went on to write: \"I believe Mitt Romney is a good and decent man, and he would bring valuable business experience to the Oval Office. He understands that America was built on the promise of equal opportunity, not equal results.</p> <p>\"In the past he has also taken sensible positions on immigration, illegal guns, abortion rights and healthcare. But he has reversed course on all of them, and is even running against the healthcare model he signed into law in Massachusetts.\"</p> <p>Obama said he was honoured to have Bloomberg's endorsement. \"I deeply respect him for his leadership in business, philanthropy and government, and [I] appreciate the extraordinary job he's doing right now, leading New York City through these difficult days,\" the president said.</p> <p>\"Mayor Bloomberg and I agree on the most important issues of our time \u2013 that the key to a strong economy is investing in the skills and education of our people, that immigration reform is essential to an open and dynamic democracy, and that climate change is a threat to our children's future.</p> <p>\"Just as importantly, we agree that whether we are Democrats, Republicans, or independents, there is only one way to solve these challenges and move forward as a nation \u2013 together.\"</p> <p>Bloomberg's support comes after New Jersey governor Chris Christie praised Obama for his handling of Sandy. Although Christie is a Republican and a prominent supporter of Romney, he went out of his way this week to repeatedly praise Obama's leadership in responding to the crisis.</p> <p>Bloomberg is an independent who had originally been a Democrat before switching to the Republicans in 2001. He won the mayorship as a Republican but fell out with the party in 2007.</p> <p>He considered running as an independent in the 2008 White House election and commissioned polls in all 50 states, dropping the idea after finding insufficient support.</p> <p>In his op-ed, Bloomberg brings climate change, largely ignored by Obama and Romney during the campaign, back to the fore.</p> <p>\"The devastation that Hurricane Sandy brought to New York City and much of the north-east \u2013 in lost lives, lost homes and lost business \u2013 brought the stakes of Tuesday's presidential election into sharp relief,\" he wrote.</p> <p>He added: \"Our climate is changing. And while the increase in extreme weather we have experienced in New York City and around the world may or may not be the result of it, the risk that it might be \u2013 given this week's devastation \u2013 should compel all elected leaders to take immediate action.\"</p> <p>Obama had taken major steps to reduce carbon consumption and Romney too had a history of tackling climate change but had reversed course.</p> <p>He said he was disappointed with Obama on many issues, listing among them healthcare reform.</p> <p>\"When I step into the voting booth, I think about the world I want to leave my two daughters, and the values that are required to guide us there. The two parties' nominees for president offer different visions of where they want to lead America,\" he writes.</p> <p>\"One believes a woman's right to choose should be protected for future generations; one does not. That difference, given the likelihood of supreme court vacancies, weighs heavily on my decision.</p> <p>\"One recognises marriage equality as consistent with America's march of freedom; one does not. I want our president to be on the right side of history.\"</p> <p>He concluded: \"Presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan both found success while their parties were out of power in Congress \u2013 and President Obama can, too. If he listens to people on both sides of the aisle, and builds the trust of moderates, he can fulfil the hope he inspired four years ago and lead our country toward a better future for my children and yours. And that's why I will be voting for him.\"</p> <p>The Economist, which has a wide readership in the US, said in an editorial it had backed Obama four years ago and was doing so again. It regretted that Romney was too far removed from the centre.</p> <p>\"This newspaper yearns for the more tolerant conservatism of Ronald Reagan, where 'small government' meant keeping the state out of people's bedrooms as well as out of their businesses. Mr Romney shows no sign of wanting to revive it,\" it says.</p> <p>It concludes: \"For all his businesslike intentions, Mr Romney has an economic plan that works only if you don't believe most of what he says. That is not a convincing pitch for a chief executive. And for all his shortcomings, Mr Obama has dragged America's economy back from the brink of disaster, and has made a decent fist of foreign policy. So this newspaper would stick with the devil it knows, and re-elect him.\"</p> <p>Fellow Republicans downplayed the significance of Bloomberg's endorsement. \"It's not surprising to me. Bloomberg is a very liberal political figure,\" said George Pataki, the former Republican governor of New York.</p> <p>Pataki also argued Romney would be \"far better\" than Obama in dealing with climate change.</p> <p>Pataki during his time as governor was one of the creators of a regional carbon trading system \u2013 which is in partial collapse since Christie pulled out last year. </p> <p>He said of Romney's position: \"I think he is far better than Obama, who embraced the Markey-Waxman bill. That is the fear when you allow people like Pelosi and Reid and Obama to draft national legislation that is not so much aimed at climate change but at expanding government power and government revenue. I think Romney would be far better.\"</p>"
