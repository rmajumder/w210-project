One of his most effective lines about the oligarchical fraud known as Mitt Romney was this one:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Governor Romney says he's got a five-point plan. Governor Romney doesn't have a five-point plan; he has a one-point plan. And that plan is to make sure that folks at the top play by a different set of rules.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>It would be terrible indeed if \"folks at the top\" were able to \"play by a different set of rules\". It might mean that <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/blogs/taibblog/ag-eric-holder-has-no-balls-20120815\">Wall Street tycoons</a> could <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/justice-for-some\">perpetrate a massive fraud</a> that virtually collapses the world economy and causes massive economic suffering, yet suffer <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/05/07/no_one_went_to_jail_so_why_is_wall_street_so_mad/\">no consequences of any kind</a> thanks to a subservient Justice Department - all while ordinary Americans are subjected to the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/23/world/americas/23iht-23prison.12253738.html?pagewanted=all\">world's largest and one of its most unmerciful penal states</a>. It might mean that the nation's largest telecoms could enable illegal spying on millions of their customers and then <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/02/us/politics/02fisa.html\">be retroactively immunized</a> from all civil and criminal liability.</p> <p>Such a state of affairs could permit the nation's most powerful political officials to be able to institute a worldwide torture regime, and systematically spy on the conversations of Americans without the warrants required by the criminal law, only to be <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/31/obama-justice-department-immunity-bush-cia-torturer\">aggressively vested with full-scale immunity by the President</a>. It could even send the rich-poor gap to heights <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-12/u-s-poverty-rate-stays-at-almost-two-decade-high-income-falls.html\">not seen in the US in many decades</a>.</p> <p>In sum, we simply cannot afford as a nation to allow \"folks at the top\" to \"play by a different set of rules\". That would be a violent breach of everything America stands for.</p>",

  "<p>Barack Obama deftly fended off Mitt Romney's attempt to pin accusations of a cover-up over the Benghazi killings on him at the presidential debate on Tuesday, with the Republican candidate emerging worse for the encounter. </p> <p>But there are still difficult questions over the death of the US ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens, and three other Americans that the Republicans can be expected to ensure haunt the president up until the election. </p> <p>Although there is so far little evidence that the issue is having a noticeable impact on voters more concerned with the state of the economy and unemployment, it does eat at Obama's characterisation of his Middle East policy as a mix of growing success against terrorism while championing freedom in the Arab world.</p> <p>There are two key questions the president has not addressed. One was posed by a member of the audience at the debate and sidestepped by Obama: who was responsible for turning down the requests from US diplomats in Libya for greater security?</p> <p>Hillary Clinton, the secretary of state, said the buck stops with her but said the actual decision lay with security officials. Obama responded to a Republican call to \"man up\" and accept responsibility by accepting responsibility at the debate. But he did not address how it was that Stevens was left so vulnerable to an attack. </p> <p>The answer appears to lie in a mix of poor intelligence after a series of earlier relatively minor attacks, financial pressures caused by Republican cuts to the state department security budget and the reality that it's almost impossible to be prepared everywhere. Look at the 1983 US marine barracks bombing in Beirut which killed 241 Americans or the 1998 bombing of the US embassy in Kenya that left 223 dead. </p> <p>Internal state department memos reflect a friction between security officials and diplomats on the ground in Libya pressing for more resources and state department officials in Washington balancing a budget greatly shrunk by the Republican-controlled Congress.</p> <p>Perhaps the more difficult question for Obama is the one Romney botched in the debate: why was the administration was so hesitant to call the Benghazi assault a terrorist attack?</p> <p>The day after the attack, Obama made a reference to \"acts of terror\" in speaking about the death of Stevens and the three other Americans. He said: \"No act of terror will dim the light of the values that we proudly shine on the rest of the world, and no act of violence will shake the resolve of the United States of America.\"</p> <p>Conservatives have tried to say that Obama was talking about attacks in general, including 9/11, not Benghazi in particular. But both speeches were framed by events in Libya and most Americans are likely to accept that is what the president was talking about.</p> <p>But it does not explain why his senior officials shied away from similar language, most notably the US ambassador to the UN, Susan Rice, who was sent on the television talk show circuit to characterise the attack as growing out of a spontaneous anti-American demonstration over a hateful video that denigrated the Prophet Mohammed. </p> <p>Even by the time Rice was speaking, it was clear that even if the demonstration had provided cover for the attack, the assault on the US consulate in Benghazi was by a group of well organised and well armed men who kept the attack up for hours. </p> <p>While administration officials said the attack was spontaneous, Republicans argued that it was a planned al-Qaida plot. State department officials conceded that it was clear the assault was planned. But probably in hours to take advantage of a volatile situation in the region over the video, not over days and weeks. And, they noted, not all armed Islamists are al-Qaida. In fact, there is only tangental evidence of an al-Qaida connection. </p> <p>Clinton has said the initial statements were the result of poor intelligence over what happened in a bloody and confusing night of fighting. </p> <p>Republicans have described that explanation as a cover-up. They say the Benghazi assault is evidence that Obama's claim to have al-Qaida on the run after the killing of Osama bin Laden is hubris and that his Middle East policy is in a shambles. </p> <p>But the president's critics may be pushing too hard. When Romney tried to accuse him of a cover-up, Obama lashed out.</p> <p>\"The suggestion that anybody in my team, whether the secretary of state, our UN ambassador, anybody on my team, would play politics or mislead when we lost four of our own, governor, is offensive,\" he said.</p> <p>Many Americans will believe it.</p>",

CNN's poll said Romney \"won\" the discussion on the economy. We'll see what the polls say next week.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Nearly as many people watched last night's debate \u2013 65.6 million at-home TV viewers \u2013 as watched the first debate, 67.2 million.</strong></p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Romney opened up a 48-46 lead among registered voters in Gallup's 7-day rolling average poll.</strong> The governor chalked up a 51-45 lead among likely voters in the poll. A Marquette University poll found Obama to be a one-point favorite in the battleground state of Wisconsin. None of the polls incorporated post-debate views.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Unemployment declined to 7.3% in the middle of October, Gallup reported.</strong> Meanwhile US home construction jumped 15% in September to hit a four-year high, according to government figures.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Much energy was expended today on fact checking</strong> Mitt Romney's claims about binders full of women, Barack Obama's claims about gangbangers and Candy Crowley's claims about what Obama said about the Benghazi attack.

One is his tendency to argue pointlessly with the moderator and his opponents over the rules of order. The other is his habit of pressing his advantage too far, seeking a kind of alpha-male moment that can seem bullying instead of strong. (His attempt at a $10,000 bet with Rick Perry was the paradigmatic example.)</p> <p>He gave in to both temptations this time around. The candidates each bickered with CNN\u2019s Candy Crowley about turns and time allotments, but Romney went at it earlier and more often \u2013 sometimes justifiably, but never successfully. He also tried too hard to pre-empt the president\u2019s increased aggression with aggression of his own, which doesn\u2019t work well in a town-hall format, where the candidates are already circling one another like sharks.

There were more than 40 organizations involved with the Massachusetts Women's Political Caucus (also bipartisan) as the lead sponsor.</p> <p>They did the research and put together the binder full of women qualified for all the different cabinet positions, agency heads, and authorities and commissions. They presented this binder to Governor Romney when he was elected.</p> <p>I have written about this before, in various contexts; tonight I've checked with several people directly involved in the MassGAP effort who confirm that this history as I've just presented it is correct \u2013 and that Romney's claim tonight, that he asked for such a study, is false.</p> </blockquote> <p>If you are in search of ridiculous Internet content, you might start with the Binders Full of Women <a href=\"http://bindersfullofwomen.tumblr.com/\">Tumblr</a>, or the Romney's Binder <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Romney_Binder\">Twitter account</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Romney_Binder/status/258395129562411011\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>EXCLUSIVE LEAKED PHOTO OF BINDER #1<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23bindersfullofwomen\">#bindersfullofwomen</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/gHHAA2oD\" title=\"http://twitter.com/Romney_Binder/status/258395129562411011/photo/1\">twitter.com/Romney_Binder/\u2026</a></p>&mdash; Romney's Binder (@Romney_Binder) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Romney_Binder/status/258395129562411011\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-17T02:32:54+00:00\">October 17, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507ebd46c0e361310bc6d0cc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T14:14:30.536Z\">3.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Romney's botched argument on Libya</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This was supposed to be the topic on which Romney made a damaging case against Obama's leadership. The case seemed brick-strong.</p> <p>For weeks after the Benghazi attack the Obama administration disseminated a misleading version of events. Secretary of State Clinton and President Obama both said the anti-Islam video produced in California played a role in precipitating the attack. The official version of events described a protest outside the Benghazi mission that gave way to armed assault.&#xa0;</p> <p>Then we were abruptly told there was no protest. It was all made up, and it came out of the secretary of state's mouth. The<a href=\"http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2012/10/198791.htm\"> US State Department background briefing</a> in a conference call last week described a quiet night that suddenly gave way to explosions. It is self-evident that security at the mission was inadequate, despite official requests for more security support.</p> <p>Romney's argument should have been a strong one. The Obama administration had had to retract similar early inaccuracies in its account of the death of Osama bin Laden. But Romney decided to try to catch the president in what he thought was a misstatement. He jumped out of his chair and nearly charged at Obama. Here's the transcript:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>CROWLEY:</strong>&#xa0;Governor, if you want to reply just quickly to this, please.</p> <p><strong>ROMNEY:</strong>&#xa0;Yeah, I \u2014 I certainly do. I certainly do. I \u2014 I think it\u2019s interesting the president just said something which is that on the day after the attack, he went in the Rose Garden and said that this was an act of terror. You said in the Rose Garden the day after the attack it was an act of terror? It was not a spontaneous demonstration?</p> <p><strong>OBAMA:</strong>&#xa0;Please proceed.</p> <p><strong>ROMNEY:</strong>&#xa0;Is that what you\u2019re saying?</p> <p><strong>OBAMA:</strong>&#xa0;Please proceed, Governor.</p> <p><strong>ROMNEY:</strong>&#xa0;I \u2014 I \u2014 I want to make sure we get that for the record, because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.</p> <p><strong>OBAMA:</strong>&#xa0;Get the transcript.</p> <p><strong>CROWLEY:</strong>&#xa0;It \u2014 he did in fact, sir.</p> <p>So let me, let me call it an act of terrorism...</p> <p><strong>OBAMA:</strong>&#xa0;Can you say that a little louder, Candy? (Laughter, applause.)</p> </blockquote> <p>Romney hung himself out to dry. Somehow he made the discussion of Libya into a farce that ended with the audience laughing at his expense. You couldn't have predicted that.</p>  <p><strong>Update:</strong> the White House transcript of the president's remarks in the Rose Garden following the Benghazi attack <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/09/12/remarks-president-deaths-us-embassy-staff-libya\">is here</a>.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T15:13:01.596Z\">at 4.13pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-507eb9fa58f91d7bbadac7ad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T14:00:26.465Z\">3.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Do you count yourself among those who don't think it's possible to <strong>declare a debate winner</strong>?

Did you watch? It was a humdinger. Here's a summary of where things stand:</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>In a confrontational joint appearance, an energized President Obama and a pugnacious Governor Romney went to the mat</strong>, not quite literally, over energy policy, job creation, taxes, trade policy, women's health, Libya and more. The possibility for a knockout punch had the fighters swinging big all night long.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Gone was the halting, listless Obama of the first debate</strong>. He repeatedly lashed out at Romney, starting by calling him an \"oil guy\" and ending by bringing up the 47% when Romney had no more time to speak. The governor sought to repay the president in kind, accusing him of shutting down oil drilling on federal land and personally investing in China. Were voters turned off by all the fighting? Or was the televised smackdown impossible to turn off? The debate went over time and was still going strong at the end.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The supposed debate rules were shredded</strong>. Moderator Candy Crowley asked multiple follow-up questions and performed spot-checks of fact, making for some of the richest exchanges of the night. Most prominently she corrected Romney on Libya, saying that Obama had in fact described the Benghazi attack as an act of terror, over the governor's statements to the contrary. As a result Romney was widely seen as having fumbled the point.&#xa0;</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Crowley nobly struggled to enforce time limits</strong>, prompting several moments of babbling cross-talk as Romney, in particular, sought to finish a point or make a last rebuttal. Meanwhile the president gently clung to the mic all night, and he finished with a 3-minute-plus advantage over the governor in speaking time.&#xa0;</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The exchanges felt personal</strong>. Romney sought to cross-examine Obama like a prosecutor. Obama accused Romney of being to the right of George W. Bush. The governor accused the president of investing his pension in China. The president accused the governor of being a pioneer of outsourcing. Romney seemed angry, Obama seemed annoyed.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Who won? The polls say the president</strong>. <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/16/breaking-cnn-poll-obama-edges-romney-in-debate/?hpt=hp_t1%20\">A CNN snap poll</a> gave the debate to Obama 46-39. <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57533850/poll-obama-edges-romney-in-second-debate/?tag=MaxDeep;leadHed\">A CBS poll</a> said the president won 37-30 (with a large proportion of respondents apparently opting for neither).&#xa0;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/grossdm/status/258556931336183809\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Oh dear.

  "<p>The question that has occupied my mind in the previous few weeks is whether the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/11/national-polling-state-polling-alternative\">divide between the state and national polling</a> can keep up. State polls had suggested that Mitt Romney has rough road to 270 electoral votes, while the national polls actually had him ahead of President Obama. </p> <p>The Gallup organization did nothing to discourage this discussion when it <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/home.aspx?ref=logo\">put out a poll</a> Wednesday afternoon that had the Twitterverse churning: Mitt Romney leading by 6 points among likely voters and by 2 points among registered voters. Let me state right now that this poll result is almost certainly <em>not correct</em>. That doesn't mean we should toss it aside, however. </p> <p>Not every poll published is going to be right on the average, and they shouldn't be. In a race where Romney is ahead by a point or tied with Obama, we should expect a few polls where he leads by more than 1 point and a few where Obama leads. That's <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/us/general_election_romney_vs_obama-1171.html\">why we had</a> an ABC/Washington Post survey with Obama leading by 3 points and the Gallup poll with Romney ahead by 6. The polls cluster around where the true result is.</p> <p>Some might say that the Gallup poll demonstrates momentum for Romney, but the truth is that, with the exception of the immediate aftermath of the first debate, the national polls indicate that neither candidate is gaining or losing ground. Romney has gained ground in Gallup, Public Policy Polling, and YouGov surveys. Obama has picked up steam in Ipsos, IBD/TIPP, and the ABC/Washington Post poll. The GWU Battleground and Rasmussen surveys have been fairly stable. Random variation is not surprising, and we are seeing it in both directions. That indicates a race that really isn't moving.</p> <p>The same thing can be said about state polling: outliers occur. The Marquette University Law School has <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/poll-race-tied-in-wisconsin-20121017\">Obama leading Romney by only 1 point</a> in the state of Wisconsin, after the prior pre-first debate poll had Obama ahead by 11. That seems like a massive jump, but keep in mind that <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/wi/wisconsin_romney_vs_obama-1871.html\">other polls</a> at the time of Marquette's previous release had the race in the mid single digits. Given how Romney gained about 4 points nationally after the first debate, we would expect Obama to lead in the low single digits in Wisconsin. The Real Clear Politics average has him ahead by 2 and the Marquette poll matches this average.</p> <p>The close race in Wisconsin does point to a potential danger sign for the president. The gap between the national and state polls doesn't seem nearly as wide as it once was. Tuesday, I outlined <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/16/romney-routes-victory-battleground-states\">three paths</a> that could lead to Romney winning the electoral college. Today, Obama's team confirmed to the National Journal's Major Garrett that their polling <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/what-s-next-in-the-obama-romney-duel-20121017?page=2\">seems to affirm</a> most of what I wrote. </p> <p>Obama is, apparently, not counting on Colorado, Florida, North Carolina, or Virginia. The states around which they are looking to build a firewall are Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, and Ohio. That means that Obama's path is to win Ohio and either Iowa or Nevada. Romney can get to a 269-269 tie with Iowa and Nevada, or a win with either these two states and New Hampshire, or by winning Ohio outright.</p> <p>Notice how Obama's team didn't include Wisconsin.</p> <p>Wisconsin is a state where the polls are tight, but neither campaign seems to be making a move. It could be that it's a case where the race is tight, while support for the candidates is solid, as I pointed out Tuesday and my buddy Nate Cohn <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/blog/electionate/108725/romney-could-use-wisconsin-its-one-obamas-strongest-battleground-states\">provided greater detail</a> on Wednesday. Obama has not dipped below 49% in any Wisconsin poll since mid-August: 49% won't win him Wisconsin, but it'll get him very, very close.</p> <p>I can't take Wisconsin too seriously as a toss-up until I start seeing more candidate visits. The seeming tightening in the polls may prompt it. If it does, then Romney picks up an additional path if we allow for wins also in Colorado, Florida, North Carolina, and Virginia. All he'll need is Wisconsin and <em>either</em> Iowa, <em>or</em> Nevada, <em>or</em> New Hampshire. In this scenario, Romney wouldn't have to take Ohio. </p> <p>Overall, we seem to be hitting a standstill of some type. Obama and Romney are close to even nationally. Obama holds leads in enough states to win the electoral college. Romney needs to catch up in these states, but he may consolidate a higher baseline before we start assigning true toss-ups to the candidates. We'll have to wait and see if the second debate, and then the third debate, make a difference. If they don't, it looks like we'll be on the edge of our seat right up to election day.</p>",
  "<p>Michael Bloomberg is setting up a Super Pac through which he intends to plough millions of dollars of his own money in an attempt to support political candidates prepared to tackle such contentious issues as gun control and same-sex marriage.</p> <p>The mayor of New York is preparing to invest up to $15m of his personal fortune backing candidates from both main parties who in his view are prepared to buck the trend towards increasing partisanship and dissension in American politics. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/18/nyregion/bloomberg-forming-super-pac-to-influence-2012-races.html\">According to the New York Times</a> which revealed the creation of the Super Pac, Bloomberg is particularly keen to encourage great debate in the areas of gun control, same-sex marriage and reform of public schools.</p> <p>As the mayor approaches the end of his term in January 2014, he is increasingly focusing his energies on outside political interests of which his new Super Pac is likely to form part. It will stand in stark contrast to most Super Pacs operating in this election cycle \u2013 though they are dominated by billionaires like him, they have tended to be devoted to furthering right-wing causes.</p> <p>Top of the lists of concerns of the new Super Pac appears to be gun control, a passion of Bloomberg's that he pursues through Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a coalition of 700 mayors from across the country in favour of greater measures to combat gun violence. In the wake of the second presidential debate on Tuesday night, Bloomberg was scathing about the comments of both Barack Obama and Mitt Romney during their exchange over firearms.</p> <p>He criticised Obama for failing to live up to the promise he made during the 2008 race for the White House to reintroduce a federal ban on semi-automatic assault rifles, and he equally lambasted Romney for saying he was opposed to any new laws related to the possession of weapons. \"One candidate has had four years to do something and hasn't, and the other candidate says he won't even do what he once did,\" Bloomberg said.</p> <p>He was particularly caustic about the attempt of both presidential candidates to relate gun violence back to inadequate education in US cities, with Romney even pointing the finger at single-parent families. \"They had all this gibberish talking about education,\" Bloomberg said. \"That education is the solution to stop the killing. My recollection is that the Aurora theater shooter was a PhD candidate. The Virginia Tech massacre was committed by a student at a first-class university.\"</p> <p>The Super Pac, the New York Times reports, will be headed by Howard Wolfson, a senior adviser to Bloomberg who was Hillary Clinton's communications chief in the 2008 battle for the Democratic presidential nomination. Candidates who will receive support from the funding body are said to include Bob Dold, a Republican member of Congress from Illinois who has pushed for gun controls and Angus King, an independent running for the US Senate in Maine.</p>",

As father of two daughters, he wanted them to be paid the same as other parents' sons.</p> <p>Female voters have jumped to top priority for both Obama and Romney. Until recently, Obama had enjoyed a double-digit lead among women over Romney, more than enough to compensate for Romney's lead among white males. But Romney's team claims Obama's lead among women has gone, though the Obama team disputes this.</p> <p>A Gallup seven-day poll tracking poll puts Romney ahead of Obama, 51% to 45%, among likely voters, though this was taken before Tuesday night's debate.</p> <p>Romney has also reduced Obama's lead in Wisconsin, a state that initially was not included as a swing state on the assumption it was going to Obama. A new Marquette University poll puts Obama on 49% to Romney's 48%.</p> <p>Over the past few weeks, Romney has been repositioning himself in the centre and has softened his position on women's issues. His campaign put out an ad on Monday insisting that women's right to contraception and abortion would not be harmed if he was president.</p> <p>His running mate, Paul Ryan, Wednesday attempted to explain away the \"binders\" remark. \"All he simply meant was that he went out of his way to try to recruit qualified women to serve in his administration when he was governor,\" Ryan, who also said that Romney had an exceptional record in recruiting women, told CBS. \"That's really what he was saying.\"</p> <p>Romney has shifted ground during his political career, from relatively moderate while governor of Democratic-leaning Massachusetts to strongly conservative on social issues during the Republican primaries and caucuses when he said he would appoint to the supreme court judges who would overturn abortion rights.</p> <p>During the debate, Romney accused Obama of misrepresenting his position on contraception, insisting he was in favour of it being widely available.</p> <p>In the debate, Obama came across as the more sympathetic to women's rights. In exchanges on equal pay, the president said: \"This is not just a women's issue. This is a family issue. This is a middle-class issue. And that's why we've got to fight for it.\"</p> <p>The comment about \"binders full of women\" came during exchanges on equal rights. Romney said that as governor of Massachusetts he was concerned about the shortage of women in his cabinet.</p> <p>\"I said: 'Well, gosh, can't we find some women that are also qualified?' And so we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet,\" Romney said. The remarks went a long way to calming the sense of panic that had begun to enter Democratic ranks.</p> <p>Obama, transformed from the listless, unfocused candidate who lost badly to Romney in the first presidential debate in Denver a fortnight ago, landed damaging blows on his Republican rival in telling exchanges over women's rights, the Benghazi consulate attack and tax proposals.</p>",
  "<p>Did you listen in to the overnight news from America a little apprehensively on Wednesday morning? Log on to your favourite news website not quite knowing what you would read about the second presidential debate? I don't think I can have been the only one.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/04/presidential-debate-romney-winner\" title=\"\">Barack Obama's seriously lacklustre performance in the first debate</a> two weeks ago was a shock at the top end of the political Richter scale. It was felt across the world, not just in America. But a careful daytime watching of Tuesday's debate absolutely confirms the initial verdict carried by Wednesday's early bulletins. Obama is back in the contest. This was partly a matter of performance; Obama turned up this time. He was combative and engaged. A fortnight ago he had given the impression his mind was elsewhere.</p> <p>But the key thing was his focused message on the central economic questions. Obama's number one task was to destroy Romney's new claims to be a moderate. He had to remind viewers of the things Romney has said all through the race for the nomination. He had to shine the light on the deeply conservative Republican party platform on which Romney stands. On that, Obama could hardly be faulted. You can feel the sighs of Democratic relief from all the way across the Atlantic.</p> <p>So is it game on again? Round one to Romney. Round two to Obama. And does everything now rest on round three next Monday in Boca Raton, the emblematic affluent Florida Geriatrica resort in which Romney made his infamous <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/election/2012/09/17/862281/romney-writes-off-low-income/?mobile=nc\" title=\"\">attack on 47% of Americans</a> in May? That's the way the media would like to frame it. Having been desperate for Romney to turn the campaign into a contest not a procession, the media has a collective interest in keeping the contest alive.</p> <p>But let's just pause a moment. Let's ask ourselves whether the right way to read the contest for the White House is through these debates? After all, that has rarely been true in the past. It certainly was not the case in 2008. Indeed before this year's election finally reached what Americans call the home stretch, the conventional wisdom was that the 2012 televised debates would not be decisive.</p> <p>This seemed at the time to be an overdue and welcome recognition of reality. Down the years the debates have always been built up as pivotal moments. But they haven't often delivered on the promise. The contest between Obama and John McCain four years ago was a case in point. Instead, as Alistair Cooke observed in this newspaper after the <a href=\"http://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/LYj_UVJ9gEyA5U9buPW8Hg.aspx\" title=\"\">first Kennedy-Nixon debate in 1960</a>, the TV confrontations have mostly confirmed viewers in the views which they had already formed.</p> <p>But then came the 3 October debate between Obama and Romney in Denver. Not for the first time, the Washington conventional wisdom was turned on its head. Romney turned in a winning performance, tacking dramatically to the centre, while Obama never really looked engaged. Ever since, the old wish for the debates to dominate the election campaign has sprung back to life. But what if the debates aren't really as important as the media \u2013 and indeed the candidates \u2013 actually think? What if the contest is being settled by other, deeper things?</p> <p>It is worth remembering our own experience in 2010 here. Britain had never had party leader debates until two years ago. Given the novelty, it isn't surprising that they had the British political class spellbound. Nick Clegg's accomplished performance in the first debate was the talk of the country. Lib Dem poll ratings briefly went off the grid.</p> <p>And then? In the end, the debates seem to have had less impact than everyone, including the leaders, thought at the time. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/apr/16/cleggmania-david-cameron\" title=\"\">Cleggmania</a> quickly ebbed and the Lib Dems ended up losing seats overall. Labour rallied a little in spite of Gordon Brown's poor showing. David Cameron did enough to come out on top but not enough to overcome wider doubts about the Tory party.</p> <p>In short, the debates provided a huge story. But they had little lasting impact on the election result. They were not the turning point. That ought to be a sobering thought for British political leaders as the 2015 election looms into view. Debates absorb a disproportionate amount of campaign resources, including the party leader's time, for a large part of our month-long campaigns. Prepping, taking part, then dealing with the outcome leaves little room for pursuing a policy agenda. Leaders won't have time for much else.</p> <p>Good thing or bad? Wrong question. Now the genie is out of the bottle, televised debates in British elections are with us to stay. Yet some of the most interesting behind-the scenes-conversations at the recent UK party conferences were about the form of the 2015 debates. I'd say there is a latent consensus in all three parties in favour of just one leaders' debate next time, instead of 2010's three. Good if so. Journalists ought to support such a plan. It would stop the domination of the campaign by the debates. The problem is rivalry between the broadcasters. If there is just one debate, who gets to ask the questions?</p> <p>Britain is not America, nor America Britain. There is nevertheless a common pattern. Televised debates are necessary but not sufficient elements in an election. They can take over, or appear to take over, from wider argument about what the country needs and from the campaign on the ground. But this is where elections are more often settled, like it or not.</p> <p>In America's 2008 election, the political class thought that John McCain either won or drew all three debates against Obama. Post-debate polls painted a very different picture in Obama's favour. But Obama didn't win in 2008 because he out-debated McCain. He won because the mood in the early economic downturn was for change and because he had superior organisation on the ground.</p> <p>This time is different. The economy still struggles. The mood is edgier. Obama is less romantic than four years ago. He has not been able to wave a magic wand. The Republicans are fired up for fanatical solutions. American demographics are going against them.</p> <p>These things were true before the debates and they will be true after they are over. Televised election debates are more a confirmatory exercise than a contest in brilliance. Their impact is limited. The public mood and the great questions of the day matter more. This is as it should be. This was always going to be a very tight election indeed. And it still is.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>October 2009</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>George Papandreou's Pasok government comes to power in Greece to find the previous centre-right New Democracy administration has been cooking the books to disguise the parlous state of the nation's finances. This one will run and run.</p> <p>Herman Van Rompuy, the Lisbon treaty's freshly minted president of Europe and summits chairman, has (self-promoting) ambitions for EU leaders' get-togethers to be held much more often than the regular four times a year. He'll never get a better opportunity.</p> <h2><strong>11 February 2010</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>First of countless emergency summits, distinguished by the lofty intent to take \"determined and co-ordinated action to safeguard financial stability in the euro area\". Not the last time we'll hear this. But bailouts are illegal \u2013 Berlin says nein.</p> <h2><strong>25 March</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>A summit. By now Greece is in effect insolvent, its borrowing costs a staggering 10%, its budget deficit nudging 13%. Berlin and bailouts \u2013 nein. Instead the Germans are pressing a new regime of fiscal rigour on the (then) 16 eurozone countries.</p> <h2><strong>2 May</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>The bailout taboo is broken. Eurozone finance ministers agree Greece&#xa0;will get \u20ac110bn (\u00a388.84bn), paving the way for a following weekend of extraordinary drama.</p> <h2><strong>7 May</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>Another special summit (Van Rompuy can't believe his plot would bear fruit so quickly) instructs finance ministers to rush to Brussels to cobble together the eurozone's first bailout fund. By the small hours of the following Monday, they exceed expectations by announcing a \u20ac440bn pot which, with IMF and European commission add-ons, becomes \u20ac750bn \u2013&#xa0;in addition to the \u20ac110bn for Greece. Crisis over?</p> <h2><strong>7 June</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>The bailout fund becomes the European financial stability facility, based in Luxembourg, and the talk turns to eurobonds or pooled eurozone debt issuance \u2013 the thickest of many red lines for Berlin.</p> <h2><strong>October</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>Angela Merkel, having been defeated on bailouts, is by now focused on dictating the terms of those defeats. Revenge. At a Normandy beach resort with Nicolas Sarkozy, she bends the then French president to her will.</p> <h2><strong>26 October </strong></h2> <p>Merkel uses French acquiescence to push through tough draft rules for a permanent bailout fund and insists on losses for private creditors to Greece, sparking an almighty fight with the European Central Bank. Ireland comes under pressure to be the new Greece.</p> <h2><strong>28 November</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>Despite trying to resist as its banks go belly-up, Ireland becomes bailout number two, forced to take \u20ac85bn.</p> <h2><strong>17 December</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>A pre-Christmas summit prevaricates.</p> <h2><strong>4 February 2011</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>Another special summit focuses on Merkel's \"competitiveness pact\", common fiscal and economic rules for the eurozone with more intrusive powers for Brussels. This leads to \u2026</p> <h2><strong>11 March</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>\u2026 another summit, and the Germans introduce their notion of a eurozone fiscal pact with obligatory debt ceilings for all, constitutionally enshrined. Oh, and Portugal needs a bailout.</p> <h2><strong>24 March 2011</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>The centre-left Portuguese government collapses. A summit has leaders focus on the fine print of the new permanent bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism.</p> <h2><strong>16 May </strong></h2> <p>Portugal becomes supplicant number three and gets a \u20ac78bn bailout, despite the absence of IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn, detained in New York.</p> <h2><strong>24 June</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>Another summit, another bailout. Admission Greek medicine has failed. The dose is increased massively by \u20ac120bn.</p> <h2><strong>21 July </strong></h2> <p>Another summit, another emergency, heated tempers, major squabbling over the terms of the new Greek bailout. Euro meltdown in prospect. A retooling of the bailout fund begins, making it much more flexible in what it can do as a pre-emptive instrument. By this stage, Europe's leaders are pulling back from mutually assured destruction to strike last-minute compromises. There must be a better way to manage crises.</p> <h2><strong>Autumn 2011</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>The stakes gets higher, the Americans are alarmed at the failures and fecklessness of European leadership. As the questions get bigger, the proposed answers also get bigger: fiscal union, a eurozone federation. No quick fixes here, but we're looking to the future.</p> <h2><strong>9 December </strong></h2> <p>Another middle-of-the-night peak in the drama, with Merkel pushing her draconian fiscal pact as the eurozone's new rulebook and David Cameron deploying his nuke, a veto on the new treaty because Britain has been refused \"safeguards\" concerning the EU single market and the interests of the City of London. All but two, the UK and the Czech Republic, push ahead with Merkel's pact as an international treaty outside EU law. UK gets nothing; the Tory backbenches feel good. The start of a serious parting of the ways \u2013 the eurozone going one way, Britain in the other direction.</p> <h2><strong>2012</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>The year opens with Spain and Italy, the eurozone's third and fourth biggest economies, as the too-big-to-fail worries.</p> <h2><strong>30 January</strong></h2> <p>Summit signs off on Merkel's fiscal pact, with the British and the Czechs outside, but the German leader looks increasingly isolated and resented.</p> <h2><strong>Spring 2012</strong> </h2> <p>Squabbling over the detail of Greece's second bailout and the losses of private creditors \u2013 Merkel's policy \u2013 which she now privately admits was wrong.</p> <h2><strong>February-March</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>Greece staring default in the face, austerity takes a devastating toll, and euro leaders bicker. European Central Bank under the new leadership of Mario Draghi buys some respite by delivering a \u20ac1tn of in cheap, short-term loans for EU banks.</p> <h2><strong>2 March </strong></h2> <p>Summit seeks to shift the terms of the argument, focusing on growth rather than austerity. Few are fooled, but the shift is an admission of sorts that the policies are either not working or not seen to be working.</p> <h2><strong>30 March</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>Meeting in Copenhagen, governments agree to temporarily pool both bailout funds to create a firewall of \u20ac700bn to \u20ac800bn, depending on whose figures you believe. Lots of claims, but little substantive change.</p> <h2><strong>6 May </strong></h2> <p>Fran\u00e7ois Hollande wins French presidential election, marking a big shift in the terms at Europe's top table. At his first EU summit on 24 May, the divisions with Germany are plain over policy to save the euro. France, Spain and Italy, all under relatively new leaderships, are now seriously challenging Merkel.</p> <h2><strong>29 June</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>One of the three or four really big summits to have taken place through amid the endless crisis management. A surprise defeat for Merkel. Spain is about to get a \u20ac100bn bailout and the summit agrees that the bailout fund can be used to recapitalise banks directly without going through a supplicant government. The German quid pro quo is to create a new eurozone bank supervisor, the ECB.</p> <h2><strong>September</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>At the ECB, Draghi reinforces sense of resolution by pledging unlimited buying of bonds in secondary markets to cushion Spain's and Italy's borrowing costs.</p> <h2><strong>Autumn 2012</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>Promising summer melts into recalcitrance and reprisal. Brinkmanship over Greece, Rajoy in Spain looking for a bailout without usual tough terms and Merkel walking away from what she was forced to concede in June. And Cyprus and Slovenia may need bailing out this year.</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney continued his march towards a centrist position on immigration during the second presidential debate, presenting a friendly face to undocumented immigrants starkly in contrast to his previous position.</p> <p>Quizzed about his support for the policy of \"self-deportation\" that he articulated during the primary season debates between Republicans, he portrayed it as a matter of choice on the part of individuals. \"People make their own choice, and if they can't find the job they want, then they'll make a decision to go to a place where they have better opportunities.\"</p> <p>But that ignored a crucial aspect of the \"self-deportation\" policy espoused not just by Romney during the primary season but by his main immigration advisers, notably the Kansas politician Kris Kobach who was the architect of several of the laws clamping down on undocumented immigrants introduced across the US. </p> <p>As Kobach <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/24/kris-kobach-immigration-law-mastermind\">explained to the Guardian</a> earlier this year, the idea would be to make life so uncomfortable for undocumented Latinos and jobs so hard to find that they would be forced out.</p> <p>Romney, mindful no doubt of the importance of the Hispanic vote in several crucial battleground status such as Florida and Nevada, also went further than he has before in embracing the idea of offering a pathway to citizenship to undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children. He said that service in the US military would be \"one way\" that such a pathway would be found \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57364444-503544/romney-on-immigration-im-for-self-deportation/\">in contrast to previous statements</a> that military service would be the only way residency could be obtained.</p> <p>Barack Obama did overstep the mark in one regard, however, in that he accused Romney of exhorting Arizona's law clamping down on undocumented Hispanics as a \"model for the nation\". In fact, during the primary season Romney lauded just one specific part of the Arizona law, SB 1070, called E-Verify \u2013 a system that allows employers to check a federal database to see if people applying for work are documented or not.</p>",
  "<p>Never let facts get in the way of a good debate. On Tuesday, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney clashed repeatedly on the issues during their second presidential confrontation, and occasionally the truth seemed to get lost among all the finger jabbing.</p> <h2>Claim</h2> <p>Obama said that the day after the attack on the consulate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/romney-obama-benghazi-defeated-debate\">he called it an \"act of terror\"</a>. Conservatives are challenging that claim.</p> <h2>The facts</h2> <p>The transcript of the president's remarks show that he was speaking about the Benghazi attack and then noted it occurred on the anniversary of al-Qaida's 9/11 assault on the US. Obama then said: \"No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter that character, or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for.\"</p> <p>The president did not explicitly single out the Benghazi attack as an act of terror. But he did appear to be referring to it in those terms, along with 9/11. He immediately went on to speak about the deaths in Benghazi again.</p> <p>The next day, September 13, in a campaign appearance in Las Vegas, Obama used similar language. \"And we want to send a message all around the world \u2014 anybody who would do us harm: No act of terror will dim the light of the values that we proudly shine on the rest of the world, and no act of violence will shake the resolve of the United States of America,\" he said.</p> <p>Romney's surprise at being called out over the claim is perhaps understandable because in the days that followed, the administration stuck to the line that the assault was a response to the anti-Muslim video. The White House sent the US ambassador to the UN, Susan Rice, to say that on television talk shows the following weekend. No mention was made of a terrorist attack.</p> <p>Finally, a week after the attack, Matthew Olsen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center, called the killings a terrorist attack, but even that was not picked up by most other administration officials. In the following week the defence secretary, Leon Panetta, and other officials followed.</p> <h2>Claim</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/gun-control-presidential-debate\">Romney defended his opposition to any new gun controls</a> by saying that there was already a ban in place for fully automatic weapons</p> <h2>The facts</h2> <p>That is not correct \u2013 it is possible for civilians to own such weapons if they are prepared to go through extended federal background checks including fingerprinting and pay a $200 tax. \"To say that fully automatic weapons don't exist in civilian hands is inaccurate,\" said Josh Sugarmann, head of the gun control advocacy group the Violence Policy Center.</p> <p>But neither was Barack Obama entirely open when it came to the issue of guns. Asked what had happened to his 2008 promise to keep AK-47s out of the hands of criminals, Obama signalled that he was prepared to see \"if we can get an assault weapons ban reintroduced.\" However, there has been no sign that the Obama administration is genuinely prepared to expend political capital on driving such a renewal of the ban through a Republican-controlled House of Representatives, or to incur by doing so the wrath of the powerful gun lobby and the National Rifle Association.</p> <h2>Claim</h2> <p>Obama accused Romney of supporting a draconian Arizona immigration law that allows police officers to ask people for identification if they suspect they have entered the United States illegally.</p> <h2>The facts</h2> <p>Romney said he had only singled out a portion of the law requiring employers to \"e-verify\" the legal status of employees as a model. A transcript of Romney's comment, made during a Republican primary debate, seems more or less support his version. During a discussion of immigration policy, he said: \"You know, I think you see a model in Arizona. They passed a law here that says \u2013 that says that people who come here and try and find work, that the employer is required to look them up on e-verify.\"</p> <p>However, immigration remains a sore point with Romney for many, particularly among Hispanic voters, because the former Massachusetts governor has advocated a \"self-deportation\" approach that aims to make undocumented immigrants uncomfortable enough to leave on their own.</p> <h2>Claim</h2> <p>Romney would not have taken Detroit \"bankrupt\"; instead he \"recommended\" auto revival plan.</p> <h2>The facts</h2> <p>The Republican candidate did not back the process that saw General Motors and Chrysler get back on its feet. He opposed using government money to bail out the carmakers, instead favouring privately financed bankruptcy restructuring. At the time, the auto industry was haemorrhaging money and US banks were in no position to loan. Under Romney's plan, it is likely both companies would have gone bust.</p> <h2>Claim</h2> <p>Obama's administration has created 5 million jobs over the last 30 months</p> <h2>The facts</h2> <p>According to the US labour department, 4.5 million jobs have been created over that stated time period. But Obama neglected to mention that in the earlier months of his tenure in the White House, America lost almost as many jobs as it has since added to the economy. So he is a net job creator, but only by a sliver.</p>",
  "<p>Mid-morning on a clear autumn day at the Elys\u00e9e palace, and the wing housing the French president's gold office, the salon dor\u00e9, was quiet. Downstairs, under the chandeliers, there was little to signify the urgency of the hour, save for the ticking of a clock shaped like a classical Greek urn.</p> <p>Outside, the fountain was in full flow and the roses in bloom in the gardens where, this summer, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande took the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, for a stroll before sitting down on the terrace for a private discussion about Europe's future. That seems a long time ago. Hollande's honeymoon period did not last long.</p> <p>Up the marble staircase, past the portraits of Pompidou, Chirac and Mitterrand, the president was running late. Eventually, he bounded from his office, true to the Mr Normal label that has become one of France's most successful political branding exercises. The French press was quick to remark, when the socialist was elected, that he had a tendency to open his own gilt doorhandles at the presidential palace rather than wait for white-gloved butlers. He is still doing it.</p> <p>The smile, brisk handshake, eye contact and \"Are you well?\" is a reminder of his days as a rural MP, canvassing markets, when he was known as one of the most prolific palm-pressers of his era. Calm and upbeat, he showed no sign of concern at his apparent flagging popularity.</p> <p>Adjoining his office, in the green room where Nicolas Sarkozy married Carla Bruni, Hollande settled into a lush dining chair, more elaborate than the rest around the meeting table. A miniature gold carriage clock had been placed at his table setting, but he still checked his wrist \u2013 modest shirt buttons, no cufflinks, under a sober black suit \u2013 for his slightly battered brown wristwatch, a far cry from Sarkozy's famously expensive timepieces.</p> <p>Hollande has never moved into the Elys\u00e9e palace, and sleeps rarely in Sarkozy's old apartments, which have not been redecorated. He still commutes from the west Paris flat he shares with his partner, Valerie Trierweiler. His Elys\u00e9e office, too, has changed little since his predecessor moved out. There are pictures on the mantelpiece of Hollande and Trierweiler on election night and certainly a change in reading matter, with works on Obama, Hollande's own election win, and a book by a Socialist party MP on state spending, subtitled Waste Less to Spend Better.</p> <p>It is five months since Hollande won the election and proclaimed from a stage in his rural fiefdom of Tulle: \"I'm sure in a lot of European countries there is relief, hope that at last austerity is not an inevitability any more.\" He said then that his mission was to demand measures for \"growth, jobs and prosperity\" from European leaders. That mission is ever more pressing now because, back at home, things are already looking tough for the new president. In France, growth is almost nonexistent, unemployment has topped 3 million, and the 2013 French budget is the harshest in 30 years in order to bring the deficit down to the figure required by Brussels.</p> <p>Hollande must not only tighten belts while promising to avoid the pain of cuts, but also studiously avoid the word \"austerity\". He also faces difficult choices on how to tackle labour reform, competitiveness, resurrect moribund industry and protect France's generous social welfare system. He is dropping in the polls: the latest, in the Nouvel Observateur, found only 40% had a good opinion of him.</p> <p>It was against this backdrop that Hollande agreed to speak to the Guardian and its partners in the Europa project, for what was his first interview with a British newspaper since his election.</p> <p>The socialist, who grew up hearing both his grandfathers' harrowing stories of the trenches of the first world war, and was once a political protege of Jacques Delors, one of the founding fathers of the single currency, was always pro-European. But that's a difficult path to tread on the French left. The French parliament's recent ratification of the fiscal treaty drawn up by \"Merkozy\" before him was a fraught process, with those on the left of his party rebelling and others on the left taking to the streets. The Socialists are still scarred by splits over the 2005 European constitution referendum and France's \"no\" vote.</p> <p>\"It was a serious warning, it wasn't listened to,\" Hollande said. Now, people had to regain trust in themselves and Europe, he added. \"What's threatening us is not the nation, it's nationalism. It's not Europe, but its absence.\" He said the biggest threat to the European Union was \"no longer being loved. Only being seen as at best an austere cash dispenser or at worst a reform school.\"</p> <p>While Hollande cautioned Merkel not to play to her national audience, he has his own delicate game to play at home in France, a country deeply attached to its sovereignty.</p> <p>Hollande said there was no question of backing down on shrinking the French deficit, not just because of promises to Europe but because from 2007 to 2012 \u2013 under Sarkozy \u2013 public debt leapt from 62% to 90% of GDP. \"Continuing that trend was not sustainable.\"</p> <p>Asked about his working relationship with Merkel, he praised her propensity for straight talking. \"She's clear, she spells things out \u2026 That saves time. And I have the same approach. After that, we're looking to find the best point of arrival from our departure points. It's much easier with explicit departure points, rather than ambiguity. And no one can accuse Angela Merkel of being ambiguous.\"</p> <p>Later, in a warning to David Cameron and other non-eurozone countries not to interfere in the single currency's political workings from the outside, he said: \"Certain countries don't want to join [the eurozone] \u2013 that's their choice. But why should they come telling us how the eurozone should be run? It's a pretension I hear but that I don't think meets the need for coherence.\"</p> <p>Asked if he would risk seeing Britain leave Europe, he said: \"I would like a UK fully engaged in Europe, but I can't decide in place of the British. I see that for the moment they want to be more in retreat. The British are tied by the accords they have signed up to. They can't detach from them. At least they have the merit of clarity. They aren't in the eurozone or budgetary union. I don't intend to force them.\"</p> <p>In a message to Germany that France would stand by the others, he said: \"France is the bridge between northern Europe and southern Europe. I refuse any division. If Europe has been reunified, it's not for it to then fall into egotism or 'each for one's own'. Our duty is to set common rules around the principles of responsibility and solidarity. As a French person, it's for me to ensure Europeans are conscious of belonging to the same group.\"</p> <p>Asked if he had said that to Merkel, he said: \"She knows it perfectly. That was the meaning of her trip to Athens.\"</p> <p>He also dismissed German concerns about the European Central Bank. \"I understand the weight of the memories of hyperinflation, passed down from generation to generation in Germany. The terms of the ECB's intervention avoid all risk of that nature, because the central bank comes in support of the decisions taken at the heart of the ESM. And what is the ESM if not a group of states? So the ECB won't create money when it comes in to support indebted countries. It will contribute to making monetary policy more efficient.</p> <p>\"I've taken on board the democratic arguments put forward across the Rhine. I perfectly admit that parliaments should be able to authorise the engagements demanded of countries both in the budgetary union and banking union. It's on those common principles that we can build solidarity. But there's no time to lose. France is ready.\"</p> <p>He added: \"I'll do everything for Greece to stay in the euro and have the resources it needs by the end of the year, without it having to be necessary to inflict new conditions other than these already admitted by the Samaras government.\" But Hollande said he also felt for the Spanish and Portuguese people \"who had paid dearly for others' excesses\".</p> <p>\"The time has come to offer a perspective beyond austerity,\" he said, adding that Spain must know the precise conditions for getting financing agreed in June. There was no reason to make its burden heavier.</p> <p>Asked if the worst was over, Hollande said: \"Yes, the worst \u2013 in the sense of the fear of the eurozone breaking up \u2013 is over. But the best isn't there yet. It's up to us to build it.\"</p> <h2><strong>Fran\u00e7ois Hollande on:</strong></h2> <p><strong>Britain: </strong>I would like a UK fully engaged in Europe, but I can't decide in place of the British. I see that for the moment they want to be more in retreat. The British are tied by the accords they have signed up to. They can't detach from them. At least they have the merit of clarity. They aren't in the eurozone or budgetary union.

  "<p>Given the importance of American national security, it was discouraging that the issue did not come up in 2012's \"town hall\" presidential debate until the last 30 minutes. Fortunately, however, when moderator Candy Crowley finally got around to it, the undecided voter's question was very specific, and quite likely on the minds of many other US citizens. Referring to Washington's denials of requests for additional security from our embassy in Libya, the questioner asked:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Who was it that denied enhanced security and why?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Short and to the point. And Barack Obama did not answer it.</p> <p>Instead, following his administration's gameplan on virtually every issue, Obama attacked Mitt Romney for allegedly politicizing the Benghazi attack. Romney responded by correctly noting that Obama and his surrogates had spent weeks erroneously blaming the assassination of four Americans on spontaneous demonstrators protesting the now-infamous Innocence of Muslims video trailer, rather than on a pre-planned terrorist attack.</p> <p>Here, it gets interesting. Obama argued, as his surrogates had several weeks ago, that he <em>had</em> described the 11 September attack as terrorism the day afterward. Crowley came to his defense. But Obama's explanation is nothing but post-facto rationalization, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/candy-crowley-republicans-benghazi-interjection\">Crowley is simply, and embarrassingly, uninformed</a>. Her intervention, which she effectively admitted after the debate was wrong, was as offensive for its error on the facts as it was for its partisanship.</p> <p>We are not simply parsing words. <a href=\"http://www.forextv.com/forex-news-story/full-transcript-of-obama-s-rose-garden-speech-after-sept-11-benghazi-attack\">What Obama said on 12 September</a>, and what he and his aides said in the weeks after, tell volumes about his ideology and worldview, and why his foreign policy is in a state of collapse. On 12 September, Obama described the tragedy in Benghazi, placing it in the context of our painful remembrance of the first 11 September attacks. He spoke evocatively of walking through Arlington Cemetery on 11 September, honoring those who made the ultimate sacrifice in Iraq and Afghanistan. Only then did Obama say:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation \u2026\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Obviously, Obama was sweeping widely disparate acts of American courage and character on distant battlefields together in a message of determination, and well said it was. But it was by no means a declaration that the Benghazi attacks were undertaken by terrorists. Quite the contrary. Just a few paragraphs before, Obama had adumbrated the Muhammad video explanation, saying:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Since our founding, the United States has been a nation that respects all faiths. We reject all efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. But there is absolutely no justification for this type of senseless violence.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Romney's central point remains critical and unanswered by Obama.</p> <p>The real issue is why the administration persisted for weeks in its interpretation that a spontaneous demonstration over the Muhammad video had gotten out of hand. This was not a problem of conflicting intelligence estimates or \"the fog of war\" as Vice-president Biden, Secretary of State Clinton and a host of others have said. As the attack was actually underway, security personnel in Benghazi were on cellphones to the State Department describing the attack \u2013 with no reference, obviously, to a demonstration that had never taken place.</p> <p>On 12 September, the State Department's under-secretary for management, briefing congressional staffers, told them it was a terrorist attack. And a senior administration counter-terrorism official, testifying before Congress just a week after the attack, characterized it as terrorism. And yet, the president spoke before the world at the United Nations thereafter, still linking the assassinations of four Americans to the video.</p> <p>Some characterize Obama's line of argument as a cover-up, an accusation the president theatrically denied during the town hall debate. Willful and repeated misrepresentation is certainly consistent with a cover-up, but it is also consistent with a presidential ideology that is so powerful and pervasive that facts and reality that don't conform to the worldview derived from the ideology are simply rejected.</p> <p>Rather than facts changing the worldview, precisely the opposite happens for Obama. The discordant facts are screened from the president's consciousness and rejected.</p> <p>The Obama storyline is that the \"war on terror\" is over, al-Qaida has been defeated, and Gaddafi's overthrow and the Arab Spring are bringing democracy to Libya. This worldview is also, coincidentally of course, very helpful to the president politically. In fact, however, the reality is quite different from Obama's ideology on all three of these points, as tragically demonstrated in Benghazi on 11 September, notwithstanding the president's stubborn unwillingness to acknowledge it. </p> <p>Thus, Tuesday's debate hardly constitutes a rejection of the Romney assessment, which is solidly grounded in facts, and is being constantly reinforced as new facts come to light. Candy Crowley and her media colleagues may have taken a momentary delight in coming to Obama's side in the debate, but the American people will ultimately not be deceived. The citizen questioner in Long Island has a question that remains unanswered, and there are many more like it. And there are still three weeks until the election.</p>",

Two competitors, each having enjoyed a spell in the lead, now even as they enter the final phase. In the battle of Mitt Romney and Barack Obama, it is 1-1 \u2013 and the decider looms.</p> <p>Officially, that comes on Monday, with the final presidential debate in Florida. The duelling rivals prepare for that with a claim to one win each, Obama's coming at the second time of asking, making up for what had been an awful drubbing a fortnight ago. The momentum will be with him as he prepares for the last face-to-face encounter.</p> <p>And yet politics is not sport. Next week's debate is unlikely to provide the cathartic satisfactions of a fifth set or penalty shootout. For one thing, it is confined to foreign policy, which will prevent the candidates airing fully the argument on which the 6 November election surely turns: what do these two men plan to do in the next four years to turn around an economy that is still ailing?</p> <p>For another, television debates can suffer from the law of diminishing returns. The initial excitement partly comes from the novelty of seeing two men, so long kept apart and having talked only about each other, suddenly standing on the same stage and talking to each other. By Monday, the Obama and Romney Show will almost be looking familiar.</p> <p>Which is not to say the spectacle is anything but compelling. The latest clash at Hofstra University confirmed that both men are unusually skilled debaters. That should go without saying about the president, who was assured even in 2008 when he did not yet have the gravitas of four years in the White House. But it counted as news this time, given the disaster Obama inflicted on himself at the first TV debate in Denver.</p> <p>There he had been lethargic, inert and passive, his head down, his expression glum. The <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2012/10/cover-story-the-first-presidential-debate.html\" title=\"\">cover of the New Yorker magazine</a> depicted Romney debating with an empty lectern, as if Clint Eastwood's invisible Obama had shown up for the event. He was so listless, so absent, one former Democratic strategist revived in conversation with the Guardian a concern he had guiltily raised once before: could the president be suffering from clinical depression?</p> <p>That Obama vanished in the second debate, replaced by a man who looked like he truly wanted the job and was ready to fight for it. Whereas he had refused countless opportunities to get the better of Romney in Denver, this time he moved fast and aggressively, accusing his opponent of failing to tell the truth within the first exchanges.</p> <p>Eighteen minutes in, they were going mano a mano, standing in each other's space and squaring up to each other, all but puffing out their chests and baring their teeth. Audience members later admitted they feared the two men might come to blows. But Obama, once deemed too professorial for the gladiatorial demands of US presidential politics, stood his ground.</p> <p>Romney was no pushover, once again <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/2012-presidential-debate-president-obama-and-mitt-romneys-remarks-at-hofstra-university-on-oct-16-running-transcript/2012/10/16/be8bfb9a-17dd-11e2-9855-71f2b202721b_print.html\" title=\"\">putting his case crisply and clearly</a>. Casting himself as the seasoned CEO and corporate turnaround artist ready to do for America what he had done for the beleaguered 2002 Winter Olympics. \"I know what it takes to balance budgets,\" he said. \"I've done it my entire life.\"</p> <p>The result was a hard-fought and absorbing contest. The veteran conservative columnist George Will said he had seen every TV debate since the birth of the format in 1960, when Kennedy took on Nixon, and <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2012/10/17/george-will-hofstra-presidential-debate-immeasurably-the-best-in-american-history/\" title=\"\">\"this was immeasurably the best\"</a>.</p> <p>Now that the two men are even on debate wins, it's conceivable that one will deliver a knockout blow \u2013 or stumble with an irrecoverable gaffe \u2013 on Monday that will settle the matter. More likely is that the campaign will now be settled away from the cameras, by those less dramatic, less visible forces that can nevertheless determine the outcome of modern US elections.</p> <p>The first of these is what political operatives call the \"ground game\", the unglamorous, mechanical business of getting people to vote. In this, Obama holds a clear advantage, just as he did in 2008 when he stunned Hillary Clinton with the depth of his grassroots organisation. In the <a href=\"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/national-politics/20121009-obama-romney-race-across-battleground-state-ohio.ece\" title=\"\">must-win state of Ohio</a> for example, without which no Republican has won the presidency, Obama has just opened his 120th field office. Romney is thought to have 36.</p> <p>Second is the under-appreciated fact that the US election is not strictly speaking just on 6 November. <a href=\"http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/09/21/14016432-early-voting-half-of-us-begins-voting-by-tomorrow?lite\" title=\"\">It began in some states on 21 September</a> and has continued ever since, thanks to early, postal and absentee voting. Americans are able to cast their ballots now in at least 40 states.</p> <p>That, too, is a source of encouragement for Obama supporters, since much of that early voting will have happened before Romney's breakthrough debate performance, thereby locking in the advantage the president held at the time. A <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/14/us-usa-campaign-poll-idUSBRE8991FR20121014\" title=\"\">Reuters/Ipsos poll</a> shows Obama leading Romney by 59 to 31% among the 7% of the electorate who have already voted.</p> <p>There's another fact of modern US electoral life which might help the president. The TV debates have an afterlife \u2013 on YouTube, Tumblr or Twitter \u2013 that did not exist before. \"Any misstep is played over and over again. It gets amplified, expanding on impact like a dum-dum bullet,\" said one strategist.</p> <p>The current victim is Mitt Romney, watching as his curious reference to <a href=\"http://andrewsullivan.thedailybeast.com/2012/10/meme-of-the-day.html\" title=\"\">\"binders full of women\"</a> \u2013 referring to female applicants for jobs in his administration as Massachusetts governor \u2013 and the moment the debate moderator told him he had got his facts wrong on Libya both go viral.</p> <p>None of which, of course, helps the undecided voter to know who has the best plan for the next four years. But the number of such truly undecided voters is getting smaller by the hour. Winning this election may soon be less about persuasion than hard graft. Like many a sporting contest, this battle will not be settled by inspiration. It's perspiration that counts now.</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney's real success in the first presidential debate was to not emerge from the wings wearing horns and carrying a pitchfork, demanding that all the women in the audience <a href=\"www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/22/republican-party-wrong-side-history-female-equality\">submit immediately to transvaginal ultrasounds</a> and relieving them of 23 cents for every dollar they happened to have on them. That is what the Obama campaign \u2013 with the help of many elected Republican officials who have been championing policies that slip easily into such shocking scenarios \u2013 prepared swing voters to expect.</p> <p>When, instead, he came off as genial and direct, a proclaimed lover of both Big Bird and green energy, a lot of Americans appeared to accept this version of Romney. Polling in the immediate aftermath of the first debate showed that the Obama-Romney gender gap, which had been as high as 20 points in some states, had shrunk to almost nothing. <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2012/10/15/swing-states-poll-women-voters-romney-obama/1634791/\">Democratic pollster Celinda Lake told USA Today</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Women went into the debate actively disliking Romney, and they came out thinking he might understand their lives and might be able to get something done for them.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/obama-campaign-trail-debate-romney\">In Tuesday night's second presidential debate</a>, however, Mitt Romney not only failed to further his case that he understood women's lives, he made the mistake of revealing exactly what it is he might be able to do for them: commission a \"binder full\" of their resumes.</p> <p>Right. I guess this is what makes him a \"small-government conservative\". Forget creating a law that allows women to sue for equal pay (the Ledbetter Act, Obama's first major piece of legislation); just personally hire a woman every once in a while.</p> <p>There were certainly moments that I found more offensive than Romney's unintentionally hilarious creation of a new collective noun (\"a binder of women\" \u2013 like, you know, a convocation of eagles), even though it edged right up to the margins of implying actual physical harm. (Binder? I hardly knew her!) There was, for instance, his weird insistence that traditional families could prevent gun violence \u2013 as everyone knows there were no mass shooting murders until gay marriage was invented in 2003.</p> <p>And there's the fact that Romney's whole \"binder full of women\" anecdote was completely bogus: he commissioned no such binder; it was provided to him by a bipartisan coalition of women's groups, which had created it prior to his election. Further, the number of women working in Massachusetts government actually <em>went down</em> during his tenure. I guess it wasn't really that full a binder.</p> <p>The biggest problem with making voters believe that Romney (or the Republican party in general) is conducting a \"war on women\" has been, up until now, that Romney and his colleagues just don't seem very scary. The children's show aficionado and advocate of cautious capitalism of the first debate is a case in point, but even the more combative presence in New York on Tuesday evening doesn't seem like someone that would do women any harm (though he would totally hit Obama if he could).</p> <p>But the war on women is something more pernicious even than a \"cold war\". Not only do we rarely see a true battle (exception provided by Todd Akin), but one of the major combatants doesn't really believe their actions count as aggressions. In a contest over civil rights, after all, the oppressor doesn't feel any pain until <em>they</em> start to lose. </p> <p>Romney just got a paper cut. We'll see if he can make the bleeding stop by election day.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Editor's note: this article originally referred to a \"convocation of owls\"; that collective noun correctly applies to eagles. The amendment was made at 3.30pm ET on 17 October</em></p>",

If Obama had produced a performance like this in the first presidential debate in Denver on 3 October, he might not have seen his poll leads overturned and now in a deadheat with Romney nationally and in many swing states.

  "<p>Barack Obama hit the campaign trail only hours after coming out on top in a feisty debate with Mitt Romney that went a long way to calming the sense of panic that had begun to enter Democratic ranks.</p> <p>Obama, transformed from the listless, unfocused candidate who lost badly to Romney in the first presidential debate in Denver a fortnight ago, landed damaging blows on his Republican rival in telling exchanges over women's rights, the Benghazi consulate attack and tax proposals.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/romney-binders-full-of-women\">An odd, patronising remark Romney made</a> to \"whole binders full of women\", in reference to job appointments, may end up bringing to a halt a shift of women voters in Romney's direction that has been worrying the Obama campaign.</p> <p>It will be several days before reliable polls gauge the overall response to the debate but Democrats expressed confidence that Obama's showing would lift them.</p> <p>\"I don't know what the polls are going to say but I feel very, very good about going into the next 20 days or so,\" vice-president Joe Biden told ABC.</p> <p>However, although Obama was deemed to have won the second presidential debate in Long Island, it was not as lopsided as the first and so is unlikely to have the same dramatic impact on the polls. Since Denver, Romney has eaten into Obama's lead and the two are now tied nationally and in most of the swing states, suggesting a tight finish on 6 November.</p> <p>Romney had a few good moments of his own in the debate, especially over the economy, with an answer that might have resonated with voters. </p> <p>\"I think you know better,\" Romney told a questioner. \"I think you know that these last four years haven't been so good as the president just described, and that you don't feel like you're confident that the next four years are going to be much better either.\"</p> <p>Obama, after flying back to Washington from the debate on Tuesday night, left the White House at about 8am, heading for two swing states, Iowa and Ohio, the latter being the state that may in the end decide the election.</p> <p>As part of the push to hold Ohio that has seen Democrats flooding the state with volunteers, Bill Clinton and Bruce Springsteen are appearing together at a free concert in Parma.</p> <p>Romney also campaigned in a swing state, Virginia.</p> <p>He and Obama go into the third and final presidential debate, in Boca Raton, Florida, on Monday, having won one debate each. The Florida debate is devoted to foreign policy, which, in theory, should be easier for Obama, who as president deals with security and overseas issues daily.</p> <p>The Obama team, in the spin room next to the Long Island debating hall, were in better spirits than their Romney counterparts.</p> <p>Conservatives \u2013 some of them, anyway \u2013 reluctantly awarded the night to Obama. The conservative commentator Charles Krauthammer told Fox News: \"I think on points, if you were scoring it on points, Obama wins.\"</p> <p>On the same network Bush's former strategist, Karl Rove, who runs one of the biggest Super Pacs backing Romney, criticised Obama for failing to set out what he would do in a second term but also conceded that Romney had made mistakes. </p> <p>\"Governor Romney, in my opinion, made a mistake asking questions of President Obama. You never ask a question and give your opponent a chance to offer an answer,\" Rove said.</p> <p>In the 90-minute debate, watched by tens of millions of Americans, Obama appeared to have learned lessons from the previous debate, retaining eye contact with Romney, with the questioners and with the camera, instead of burying his head in a notebook.</p> <p>His personal hostility towards Romney was apparent during several exchanges when the two went head-to-head. He accused Romney of being more extreme on social issues than George W Bush and described his tax plans as \"a sketchy deal\".</p> <p>But the most politically damaging moment for Romney came when he bungled his attack on the Obama administration's handling of the assault on the Benghazi consulate in which the US ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed.</p> <p>It should have been an easy one for Romney, after days of shifting accounts from administration officials who initially blamed the attack on a protest over an anti-Islamic film but have now conceded it was a pre-planned terrorist attack.</p> <p>Obama's response provided the most moving and powerful part of the night. \"The day after the attack, governor, I stood in the Rose Garden, and I told the American people and the world that we are going to find out exactly what happened, that this was an act of terror.</p> <p>\"And the suggestion that anybody in my team, whether the secretary of state, our UN ambassador, anybody on my team would play politics or mislead when we've lost four of our own, governor, is offensive. That's not what we do. That's not what I do as president. That's not what I do as commander-in -chief.\"</p> <p>When Romney tried to challenge the president over his assertion that he had described it as an act of terror, the moderator Candy Crowley intervened to say that Obama was correct. \"He did, in fact, sir,\" she told Romney, who was unable to counter-attack.</p> <p>Conservatives criticised Crowley's intervention, pointing out that Obama had been talking generally and ambiguously about an act of terror and it had not necessarily been a direct reference to Benghazi.</p> <p>Obama also hit home in an exchange over Romney's investments in China. When the Republican responded that Obama should look at the investments in his own pension, Obama, with his trademark grin, shot back: \"I don't look at my pension. It's not as big as yours.\"</p> <p>The power of the quip was that it encapsulated the image the Democrats have been labouring to put across of Romney as rich and elitist, in a different league from the majority of Americans.</p> <p>The two are battling hard for women's votes. Obama has for months enjoyed a bigger share of support among potential women voters but Romney has been closing the gap over the last fortnight. But he may have lost some with an odd comment about when governor of Massachusetts he was concerned about lack of women in his cabinet and asked women's groups for names. He said they came forward with \"whole binders full of women\".</p>",

That is the clearest indication of their lack of political will and initiative. They are simply disconnected from the real activists and the grass roots organisations ...</p> <p>Look at examples from history - any alternative political force trying to unseat a long-standing power would seize on any opportunity to galvanize its political support. That kind of political support is not going to happen in Paris or [Washington] DC.</p> <p>Why not seize the initiative? There are practical problems with it, but if there is political will you can see how things can be over turned. But you don\u2019t see any attempt at doing that - We have seen very few visits by SNC leaders.</p> </blockquote> <p>If credible a leadership does not emerge inside the country, Syria faces five more years of civil war, he warned. Syrians will give up on the uprising if they don\u2019t get clarity from the opposition about the alternatives to the Assad regime, he argued.</p> <p>Calls by the international envoy Lakhdar Brahimi for a ceasefire are a \u201ccosmetic\u201d exercise to try to show that something is being done, Sharro added. The countries backing Brahimi\u2019s mission are also \"fuelling the fire\" in Syria, he claimed.</p> <p>The current international squabble for regional dominance over Syria is frustrating the emergence of opposition leaders, Sharro argued. Saudi Arabia, for example, should stop funding Salafist groups, because they are distorting the conflict, and thwarting the growth of a more organic opposition inside Syria.</p> <p>Sharro called for the conflict to become \u201cdeinteranationalized\u201d.</p> <p>He criticised the west\u2019s \u201creluctant meddling\u201d on Syria as stuck between neither fully committing to arming the rebels, nor finding a peaceful solution. \u201cBoth the US and the international community are making matters worse,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Members of the current regime, such as vice president Farouq al-Sharaa, could play a role in an alternative government to avoid the disaster that occur in Iraq following de-Ba\u2019athification, Sharro said.

  "<p>Neither presidential candidate were fully open during the debate when it came to the issue of guns, one of the most contentious and arguably least thoroughly debated subjects in American society.</p> <p>Asked what had happened to his promise, made during the 2008 presidential race, to keep AK-47s out of the hands of criminals, Barack Obama signaled that he was prepared to see \"if we can get an assault weapons ban reintroduced\". </p> <p>That was in tune with occasional comments from Obama administration officials in favour of renewing the Federal Assault Weapons Ban on the manufacture of semi-automatic weapons that was introduced by Bill Clinton in 1994 but allowed to lapse by George Bush 10 years later.</p> <p>However, there has been no sign that the Obama administration is genuinely prepared to expend political capital on driving such a renewal of the ban through a Republican-controlled House of Representatives or to incur by doing so the wrath of the powerful gun-lobby and the National Rifle Association. </p> <p>Josh Sugarmann, head of the gun control advocacy group the Violence Policy Center, pointed out that Obama could have made an impact on the number of AK-47s and other such semi-automatic rifles in the country by wielding powers he already possesses to ban the import of foreign weapons that do not pass a \"sporting purposes test\".</p> <p>On Romney's part, he defended his opposition to any new gun controls by saying that there was already a ban in place for fully automatic weapons. That is not correct \u2013 it is possible for civilians to own such weapons if they are prepared to go through extended federal background checks including fingerprinting and pay a $200 tax.</p> <p>\"To say that fully automatic weapons don't exist in civilian hands is inaccurate,\" Sugarmann said.</p>",
  "<p>An MP who was once told to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2011/may/12/women\" title=\"\">get out of a parliamentary lift</a> because it wasn't meant for the likes of her, told on Monday how one Twitter wag suggested she and her female colleagues get their \"jugs out for the boys\" as otherwise they were too awful to pay attention to.</p> <p>Stella Creasy has only been the Labour party MP for Walthamstow since 2010 but, since then, she has already witnessed the sort of casual sexism that belies the suggestion that gender equality is an old story in politics. Her experience and ability to speak out about it act as a counterpoint to all those who feel that 22% (the number of female MPs) is just a reflection of the other choices women have (babies? Latte-sipping?) rather than of any extra challenge a male-dominated workplace might present.</p> <p>It's not just in politics either. The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/oct/14/sexist-stereotypes-front-pages-newspapers\" title=\"\">research</a> published on Monday by Women in Journalism, which simply added up the numbers of men and women appearing on front pages, was described as \"self-pitying, whinging piffle\" by a woman, Dame Ann Leslie, who possibly believes, like many other success stories, that if it worked for her it can work for everyone.</p> <p>Just look at some of the reactions to the Jimmy Savile stories for more evidence (at least before the stories of the hospital beds and care home prowling). Yes, they all cry, we were all groped, squeezed, demeaned and laughed at. It was character- and career-building stuff. You young whingers just don't know how lucky you are. Perhaps this is why women such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/oct/14/kat-banyard-feminist-pornography-equality\" title=\"\">Kat Banyard</a>, the 27-year-old founder of <a href=\"http://ukfeminista.org.uk/\" title=\"\">UK Feminista</a> who spoke alongside Creasy at the Women in Journalism launch on Monday, believe we are still fighting for equality more than 40 years after the Equal Pay Act was passed. Banyard is nearly always mobbed by young women wanting to find out how they can help when she talks at these events. It seems to me that groups such as Feminista, raising awareness through social media as well as physical protest, is giving voice to a generation of women who neither want to keep quiet nor whinge.</p> <p>This desire by a new generation of young women to speak up is confounding politicians. And not just in the UK.</p> <p>It goes part of the way to explaining how Mitt Romney, a multi-millionaire whose wife has made it clear that she never expected him to help her with her job of looking after house and home, could get it so wrong with his \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/shortcuts/2012/oct/17/binders-full-of-women-romneys-four-words?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">binders full of women</a>\" gaffe. Trying to paint himself as pro-diversity and choice, at least when it came to candidates for a job, he manages to lump all women together. Those women who didn't quite make the (first) cut. Read this brilliant breakdown of his <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/17/romney-binders-full-of-women?intcmp=122\" title=\"\">speech</a> by Emma Geller.</p> <p>Within minutes there was a #bindersfullofwomen hashtag on Twitter, a Tumblr and a Facebook page, which had 70,000 likes by the end of the debate.</p> <p>The speed of this reaction also finds echoes in the response to Julia Gillard calling her opposition rival Tony Abbott a misogynist. An internet sensation (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihd7ofrwQX0\" title=\"\">watched nearly 1.9m times on YouTube</a>), Gillard was able to issue a rallying cry not because of her politics necessarily, nor even because many understood what the man she was defending had actually done, but because she spoke for all those fed up with the laughing acceptance of sexism. What's more, she did it with some style.</p> <p>The editor of the Macquarie Dictionary, Sue Butler, is even to update the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/australia/9614172/Australian-misogyny-row-leads-to-dictionary-definition-change.html\" title=\"\">Australian dictionary</a> to include the current usage of the term to denote someone prejudiced against women and not just holding a \"hatred of women\", the literal translation of the original Greek <em>misos</em> (hatred) and <em>gyny</em> (female).</p> <p>Feminist theorists has long suggested that misogyny can be manifested in numerous ways, from sexual discrimination to violence against women and sexual objectification of women.</p> <p>But one poster to the Daily Telegraph accused the dictionary compilers of living out an \"Alice in Wonderland fantasy where a word means whatever they want it to mean not what the rest of the world understands\".</p> <p>Evidence from today suggests that perhaps the \"rest of the world\" is changing along with our use of language. And it is right to expect our political leaders to reflect that change. Women, at least in the UK, US and Australia, make up half the electorate, after all.</p> <p>The MP who tried to throw Stella Creasy and her female researcher out of the MPs' lift apologised and blamed his age for the gaffe. It won't work for Romney and it should no longer work for anyone else who thinks that what was then can continue now.</p>",
  "<p>It was the moment that women's issues finally took centre stage in a presidential debate, although probably not in the way Mitt Romney would have wanted. </p> <p>Within minutes of the Republican presidential candidate uttering his now-infamous line about \"binders full of women\", the phrase had unleashed its own hashtag, Twitter and Facebook account, and a binder full of bile from critics furious at its perceived patronising tone.</p> <p>Romney used the line to demonstrate his track record on pay equality for women, claiming that when he was governor of Massachusetts he was told the only applicants for positions in his state cabinet were men.</p> <p>\"And I said: \"Well, gosh, can't we \u2013&#xa0;can't we find some \u2013 some women that are also qualified?\" Romney told the debate audience. \"And \u2013 and so we \u2013 we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet. I went to a number of women's groups and said: 'Can you help us find folks,' and they brought us whole binders full of women.\"</p> <p>Within minutes the phrase was trending on Twitter. But as well as being ripped apart on social media Romney also found the veracity of his claim being called into question. According to David Bernstein of the Phoenix, a Boston newspaper, the story Romney told an estimated 50-60 million viewers was untrue.</p> <p><a href=\"http://blog.thephoenix.com/BLOGS/talkingpolitics/archive/2012/10/16/mind-the-binder.aspx\">Bernstein reported</a> that there was indeed an effort in Massachusetts to find qualified women for cabinet positions.</p> <p>But Romney nor his staff, nor even his party, had anything to do with it, he said.</p> <p>\"What actually happened was that in 2002 \u2013 prior to the election, not even knowing yet whether it would be a Republican or Democratic administration \u2013 a bipartisan group of women in Massachusetts formed MassGap to address the problem of few women in senior leadership positions in state government,\" he wrote. \"There were more than 40 organizations involved with the Massachusetts Women's Political Caucus (also bipartisan) as the lead sponsor.</p> <p>\"They did the research and put together the binder full of women qualified for all the different cabinet positions, agency heads, and authorities and commissions. They presented this binder to Governor Romney when he was elected.\"</p> <p>Not only was Romney not involved in the effort to find qualified women, he did not pay much attention to the results, Bernstein said, debunking another of Romney's claims on the hot button topic of equality in the workplace.</p> <p>Romney told Candy Crowley, the moderator of Tuesday night's debate, of his pride at his achievements.</p> <p>\"I was proud of the fact that after I staffed my Cabinet and my senior staff, that the University of New York in Albany did a survey of all 50 states, and concluded that mine had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America.</p> <p>Now, one of the reasons I was able to get so many good women to be part of that team was because of our recruiting effort.\"</p> <p>Bernstein, who checked with several people involved in MassGap, who confirmed the reporters take on events, said:</p> <blockquote> <p>First of all, according to MassGAP and MWPC, Romney did appoint 14 women out of his first 33 senior-level appointments, which is a reasonably impressive 42%. However, as I have reported before, those were almost all to head departments and agencies that he didn't care about \u2013 and in some cases, that he quite specifically wanted to not really do anything. None of the senior positions Romney cared about \u2013 budget, business development, etc \u2013 went to women.</p> <p>Secondly, a UMass-Boston study found that the percentage of senior-level appointed positions held by women actually declined throughout the Romney administration, from 30.0% prior to his taking office, to 29.7% in July 2004, to 27.6% near the end of his term in November 2006.</p> </blockquote> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/politicalintelligence/2012/10/16/fact-check-romney-record-hiring-women/r3gqpykaQudNNqigmLZfuJ/story.htm\">fact check in the Boston Globe</a> on Romney's hiring of women in the private sector also found his record there to be wanting. Romney did not have any women partners as CEO of Bain Capital during the 1980s and 1990s, it found.</p> <p>Romney has gained ground in opinion polls among women voters, a position Obama has traditionally held, since the first presidential debate.</p> <p>But his latest comments, which are unlikely to be forgotten if social media is anything to go by, will do him few favours.</p> <p>Women in a snap poll by the Democratic Lake Research Partners picked Obama as the debate winner by 56-34%. Men also gave Obama the victory, but by a narrower 49-43 percent, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/17/us-usa-campaign-women-idUSBRE89G0AY20121017\">according to Reuters</a>.</p>",

Instead of insisting that Romney was like Bush, as might have been expected \u2013 Romney's fantasy to remake the Middle East is vintage Bush \u2013 the president conceded that Romney was different from Bush.

  "<p>Candy Crowley, the moderator at Tuesday night's presidential debate, is coming under intense criticism from Romney supporters for the way she intervened in the rowdy dispute between the two presidential candidates over Libya.</p> <p>Conservative commentators responded with fury to what they believed was inappropriate meddling at a crucial moment in the town hall debate. The prominent rightwing pundit Charles Krauthammer accused Crowley of having \"contaminated\" the discussion by apparently incorrectly supporting Obama in his account of events over the attack on the US embassy in Benghazi in which the American ambassador died.</p> <p>Michelle Malkin, a conservative blogger, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/michellemalkin/status/258403793153179648\">tweeted that the moderator was wrong</a> to have backed an \"Obama lie\" over Libya. The most lurid complaint came from John Nolte, writing on the <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2012/10/16/Crowley-Saves-Obama-with-false-fact-check\">rightist aggregation site Breitbart.com</a>, who charged Crowley not only with jumping into the debate to take Obama's side but also of steering the entire debate in such a way as to make it \"a total and complete setup to rehabilitate Barack Obama\".</p> <p>As the criticism of Crowley mounted, liberal commentators leapt to her defence, sending the hashtag #gocandy trending on Twitter. Hilary Rosen, a Democratic voice on Crowley's channel CNN, counter-punched that \"Romney is trying to bully Candy Crowley. He looks rude.\"</p> <p>Bill Maher, comedian and acerbic TV host, lamented that the moderator was being pummelled by Romney and Obama. \"Both of them are trying to roll over Candy Crowley. And that can't be easy.\"</p> <p>The spat over Benghazi came at a key stage in the presidential showdown. Obama, emboldened by his feisty performance thus far, and Romney, rising to the challenge, were by that point unrestrained in their attacks on one another.</p> <p>When the matter of the Benghazi assault came up, as Crowley said afterwards that she had expected it to, Romney launched into his by now familiar criticism of the Obama administration over the events in Libya. He said that it had misled the American people in the days after the attack by presenting it as a spontaneous eruption from a demonstration rather than a planned terrorist act.</p> <p>\"It took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror,\" Romney claimed.</p> <p>Obama riposted fiercely by saying that on 12 September, the day after the attack, he had addressed the nation from the Rose Garden of the White House. \"I stood in the Rose Garden and I told the American people \u2026 that this was an act of terror.\"</p> <p>When Romney doubted his recollection of events, Obama said: \"Get the transcript.\" </p> <p>It was at that moment that <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/17/us-usa-campaign-crowley-idUSBRE89G09I20121017\">Crowley stepped gamely</a> \u2013 fatefully, some might say \u2013 into the ring. On the morning after the event she admitted that she had surprised herself by speaking out, saying it was the \"natural thing that came out of me\".</p> <p>\"He did in fact, sir. So let me \u2013 let me call it an act of terror \u2026,\" she said.</p> <p>\"Can you say that a little louder, Candy?\" Obama chimed in.</p> <p>\"He did call it an act of terror,\" she duly supplied, though, sensing perhaps that she had strayed into a very hostile place, she added that Romney was also correct in that the administration had taken two weeks or so to get the whole picture of the assault out.</p> <p>The truth of the matter, as is so often the case in these pressurised televised events, was more nuanced than either side suggested. Crowley did not, as conservatives are now chanting, make a naked error that displayed her political bias towards Obama. But nor did she get it entirely right.</p> <p>In his Rose Garden speech <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/09/12/transcript-president-obama-remarks-following-deadly-attacks-at-us-consulate-in/\">Obama did use the phrase</a> \"acts of terror\", but he did so in the plural and within a general discourse on the threats facing the US rather than as a specific reference to Benghazi.</p> <p>Having become the story, an uncomfortable place for any journalist, Crowley may console herself with the knowledge that presidential moderators are damned when they do, damned when they don't. The moderator of the first debate on 3 October, Jim Lehrer of PBS, was pounded for having been too passive \u2013 quite the opposite of the response to Crowley's perceived interventionism.</p> <p>At one point Crowley alluded to the bind she was in. As both the candidates went at each other, fingers jabbing, ignoring her appeals to stay on question, she said: \"I understand the stakes here. I understand both of you. But I will get run out of town if I don't allow\u2026 \"</p> <p>She never got to finish the sentence: the candidates had drowned her out.</p>",

But the Obama they wanted to see \u2013 aggressive, quick to paint Romney as a re-run of the worst of the Bush years, flashes of indignant fury that his administration's credibility is being questioned \u2013 may or may not be who those few remaining undecided voters wanted to see. Obama's performance Tuesday night will do wonders for Democratic morale, but we may not see much shift in the tracking poll numbers.</p> <p>CNN's coverage offers a fascinating live response from undecided voters: judging from the twin lines on the bottom of the screen (one for men, the other for women) both candidates did pretty well and voters didn't like it when either man attacked the other. Of course, candidates in races at all levels wouldn't use negative attacks if they didn't work; one wonders if the diving lines indicated the respondents genuinely didn't like the attacks, or whether they've just been conditioned to know they're <em>supposed</em> to express disapproval of them.</p> <p>The snap polls, too, pointed to an Obama win in the marginal-to-modest range: in CBS News' instant poll, 37% said Obama won the debate, 30% said Romney, and 33% said it was a tie. Interestingly, 65% said Romney won on the issue of economy, compared to 34% who said Obama. In CNN's poll of registered voters who watched the debate, 46% said Obama won the debate, 39% said Romney won the debate.</p> <p>Those results indicate it wasn't a bad night for Mitt Romney, and there was little chance he would equal the drubbing he dealt the president in the first debate. But a little more than an hour into the debate, he completely mishandled one of the most potent issues \u2013 how the administration characterized the attack on our diplomats in Benghazi, Libya. He seemed to know it, as his energy slid for the remainder of the debate.</p> <p>Between the questioners at the debate and Frank Luntz's focus group on Fox News, one of the lessons of the night is that very few people who claim to be undecided are genuinely undecided. The early questioner who mentioned that Energy Secretary Steven Chu has said that the overall goal of the nation's energy policy is not to bring down the prices of gas \u2013 no chance he's genuinely undecided. (<a href=\"http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2012/10/09/dems_don_t_want_lower_gas_prices\">Conservative radio talkshow host Rush Limbaugh talked about the issue</a> and mentioned Chu last week.) One woman who asked the candidates about unequal pay for women \u2013 an easy lay-up for Obama to mention the Lilly Ledbetter Act. The majority of Luntz's focus group of allegedly undecided voters loathed Obama's performance, and during a furious denunciation of Obama's presidency, one panelist let slip the term \"bullshitting\" on the air. Are we to believe that guy really doesn't know who he's going to vote for in November?</p> <p>The \"town hall\" debate format has been around for 20 years, and it may be time to consider retiring it at the presidential level. The questioners tend to freeze under the lights; almost all of the queries are variations of \"what can you do for me?\"; the candidates have been conditioned to repeat the questioner's name and emote sympathy&#xa0; to the point of overacting; and way too much attention is paid to the candidates' body language as they get up and down off those high stools.</p> <p><em>Jim Geraghty is a contributing editor to the National Review and writes the Campaign Spot blog</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/michael-cohen\">Michael Cohen</a>: 'Romney's reliance on tired, substance-less talking points was startling'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397925060\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2011/8/6/1312655160523/Michael-Cohen-003.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Cohen\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Cohen Photograph: Observer</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Well, that was unexpected.</p> <p>Going into last night's second presidential debate I fully expected Barack Obama to do better than he did in the first debate in Denver. But what was so surprising was not just how good Obama was (and he was quite good), but how bad Mitt Romney was.</p> <p>It all started with the first question, posed by an undecided college student concerned about his job prospects after graduation. It was a softball, one that a candidate with an even the modicum of an economic plan could knock out of the park.</p> <p>And Romney whiffed on it \u2013 serving up meaningless platitudes like this:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I know what it takes to create good jobs again. I know what it takes to make sure that you have the kind of opportunity you deserve. And kids across this country are going to recognize, we're bringing back an economy.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>There was not a single policy offered to support Romney's confidence. For a candidate whose entire candidacy is premised on the notion that he will fix the economy and create jobs, it was a glaring moment. It was like this the entire evening: Romney's lack of specificity and his reliance on tired, substance-less talking points was startling.</p> <p>For example, when asked how he would ensure women received equal pay in the workforce, Romney bragged about hiring women for his administration when he was governor of Massachusetts. It was an answer that reeked of tokenism. On taxes, he continued to offer vagueness about how he'll pay for his 20% across-the-board tax cut. And bizarrely, he cued up Obama to reference his 47% comment by saying he wanted to be president of 100% of Americans. It was like he handed the president the piece of two-by-four with which to hit him.</p> <p>But his worst moment came during a question on Libya when Romney claimed that the president had never called the recent assassination of the US ambassador in Benghazi \"act of terror\". Obama had, in fact, done just that \u2013 a point that moderator, Candy Crowley pointed out, embarrassingly for Romney. But what I found most striking about that particular exchange was what came right before \u2013 President Obama's initial response to Romney:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The day after the attack, governor, I stood in the Rose Garden and I told the American people in the world that we are going to find out exactly what happened. That this was an act of terror and I also said that we're going to hunt down those who committed this crime. And then a few days later, I was there greeting the caskets coming into Andrews Air Force Base and grieving with the families.</p> <p>\"And the suggestion that anybody in my team, whether the secretary of state, our UN ambassador, anybody on my team, would play politics or mislead when we've lost four of our own, governor, is offensive. That's not what we do. That's not what I do as president, that's not what I do as commander-in-chief.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>This was a very different Obama than the one we saw in Denver \u2013 focused, passionate (but not strident), aggressive (but not obnoxious). On virtually every answer, Obama did exactly what he didn't do in Denver: he defended his record and then opened up a tough line of attack against his opponent. There was nothing more important for Obama to do last night than offer voters a clear contrast between the two candidates. On nearly every question, Obama did just that.</p> <p>It was a strong performance from a candidate whose back was against the wall; but it was one that's effectiveness was matched only by the failure of his opponent.</p> <p><em>Michael Cohen is a US political columnist for the Guardian and Observer</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ana-marie-cox\">Ana Marie Cox</a>: 'The highlight was Obama's full-throated defense of reproductive rights'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397925061\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/9/28/1317225418768/Annmarie_Cox.jpg\" alt=\"Ana Marie Cox\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>There were flashier moments in the debate \u2013 the Libya fact-check, the oil permits body-space infringement \u2013 but, for me, the highlight of the debate was President Obama's full-throated defense of the idea that reproductive rights \"are not just women's issues, these are family issues, they are economic issues.\" Up until now, even the Obama campaign has been leaning on the \"war on women\" meme as something that is somehow separate from the economy, that \"social issues\" are a kind of marginal voter-persuasion issue \u2013 on par with \"who you would rather have a beer with?\"</p> <p>I've argued before that almost every so-called social issue is wrapped up in economics (marriage equality and social stability help communities thrive, for instance), but contraception has been essential to women's <em>economic</em> equality for, well, probably ever. But <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/26/birth-control-access-womens-wages_n_1380250.html?ref=politics&amp;ir=Politics\">studies of recent history</a> are more concrete:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"About one-third of women's wage gains throughout the 1990s can be attributed to changing laws in the 1960s and 70s that lowered the age at which women could legally access the pill.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>I'm not sure if this means that <em>voters</em> will make the connection the president did \u2013 that Romney's policies would potentially undo that progress \u2013 but I'm grateful that at least one of the men on that stage understands what I think most women intuitively do: that when we talk about having control over our bodies, we're also talking about having control over our lives.</p> <p>Also, I've never been in a binder, but I am pretty sure I'd rather be able to sue for equal pay.</p> <p><em>Ana Marie Cox is the Guardian's senior US political columnist</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jamesantle\">James Antle</a>: 'The most disastrous exchange for Romney concerned Libya'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397925062\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/06/02/james_antle_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"James Antle\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Whatever else can be said, this was a much more spirited Barack Obama in the second debate. The president was much more willing to challenge Mitt Romney on his facts, on his record, and on his career in business.</p> <p>We heard about Bain, the 47%, and outsourcing of US jobs to China. Obama even unfavorably compared Romney to George W Bush, the president responsible for the next highest spending binge.</p> <p>But Romney remained spirited as well. He did not simply allow Candy Crowley to steamroll him and give the president favorable treatment. He contested Obama's most politically damaging claims.</p> <p>Romney was particularly effective in advertising the undeniable distance between the president's 2008 campaign promises and the rather less impressive 2012 record. Obama still was shy on details of what he would do in a second term, aside from continuing to present mediocrity as better than what a Republican would do in office.</p> <p>Yet the most disastrous exchange for Romney concerned Libya, where he concerned himself more with talking points and chest-beating than actual problems with Obama's interventionist approach. Indeed, Obama undermined Romney by unequivocally claiming full responsibility, rather than blaming Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>If that is any indication of how the third and final debate, focusing on foreign policy, will go, then Romney \u2013 the candidate who has appeared to commit himself to arming Syrian rebels, a more hawkish stance toward Iran, and disapproving of the the largely Iraqi-mandate withdrawal from Iraq\u2013 is in serious trouble.</p> <p><em>James Antle is editor of the Daily Caller News Foundation and a senior editor at the American Spectator</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/cheri-jacobus\">Cheri Jacobus</a>: 'Obama was testy, whiny, overly aggressive'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397925063\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/1/3/1325610796868/cherijacobus_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Cheri Jacobus\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The question leading up to the second debate between Governor Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama was \"which Obama will show up tonight?\"</p> <p>The abysmal performance by Obama in the first debate was not something the president's supporters wanted to see repeated. Mitt Romney needed to match his performance from the first debate. Barack Obama needed to do significantly better than he did in the first debate.</p> <p>Both men achieved those objectives. Romney reminded voters of the poor Obama record of these past four years, and was armed with facts, while Obama claimed Romney was not telling the truth, yet did not seem equipped to articulate just where Romney was incorrect.</p> <p>While Obama at least seemed present and possessing a pulse in the second debate, he was testy, whiny, overly aggressive, and even asked for \u2013 and received \u2013 a highly inappropriate level of help and support from the debate moderator. Mitt Romney was presidential, just as he was in the first debate. He had command of the facts, but was repeatedly interrupted by Obama and the moderator.</p> <p>Obama claimed Mitt Romney was untruthful, but could not be not specific. However, Romney clearly and correctly stated that President Obama was, indeed, untruthful in his claims that federal oil production was up. Obama denied it, and the moderator did not step in to call him on it.</p> <p>Obama (and the moderator) also claimed he called the 11 September assassination attack in Benghazi that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans a \"terrorist attack\" the following day in a Rose Garden speech. The transcript does not reveal that specifically, but in the days that followed, President Obama on numerous occasions claimed the attack was due to a video that was deemed insulting to Islam. He has since backed away from those comments and is now denying he made them, as part of his ever-shifting statements on Benghazi. The debate moderator let him get away with that one, too.</p> <p>While Obama likely succeeded in helping to clean up the mess he'd made with his disappointed base, Mitt Romney did not lose anything, and maintains the momentum from the first debate.</p> <p><em>Cheri Jacobus is a Republican political strategist, pundit and writer</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/nancy-goldstein\">Nancy Goldstein</a>: 'The relaxed, engaging Professor Obama connected the dots'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397925064\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2011/6/8/1307540115667/nancygoldstein_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Nancy Goldstein\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Mitt Romney isn't entirely to blame for last night's resurgence by Barack Obama. OK, so he was callow and creepy, but no more than usual (it's hard to shake the feeling that both he and Ryan were assembled in a basement). The bottom line is that Obama had a Big Night, one where he hit all his shots.</p> <p>Gone was the dour and pedantic grumpster that sleepwalked through debate one. When a young woman asked how his administration intends to address inequalities in the workplace, particularly around pay, it was the relaxed, engaging Professor Obama who connected the dots, moving easily from mentioning the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act his administration passed in 2009, to making the case that equal pay for equal work has moved from being a \"women's\" or \"family\" issue, to become a key issue for the middle class, period.</p> <p>Romney, who punted when asked earlier this year whether he supported the Ledbetter Act, could only squirm. Worse yet, his longwinded non-response was: a) a <a href=\"http://elections.americablog.com/2012/10/romneys-binder-full-of-women-story-was-a-lie.html\">lie</a>, and b) included the \"whole binders full of women\" comment that has, at last count, inspired over a dozen social media equivalents of cover bands including Tumblr accounts, Facebook pages,websites, and several Twitter feeds, with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Romneys_Binder\">Romneys_Binder</a> leading the pack at 14,000+ followers.</p> <p>Like all great competitors, last night's Obama read the opposition well and created his own shot. While Romney tried to recover his Just for Men cool after flubbing the Ledbetter question, the president linked women's success in the workplace to healthcare; healthcare to contraception; and contraception (as well as mammograms and screenings for cervical cancer) to Planned Parenthood, which he supports and Romney actively wants to defund. Obama reminded his audience that while his healthcare plan mandates free contraception as part of standard insurance, Romney supports <a href=\"http://www.blogforchoice.com/archives/2012/03/romney-bosses-s.html\">repealing that provision through the Blunt amendment</a>.</p> <p>Obama's move was the debate equivalent of driving past an opponent to the basket, then dunking on him.

The Foreign Office has also urged the Scottish government to provide evidence for its \u201cclaims about the status of an independent Scotland, including its membership of international bodies\u201d such as the European Union, the United Nations, Nato, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

The risk is much more difficult to assess. I believe that the risk is somewhat increased, and I don\u2019t want to exaggerate this, but somewhat increased by the absence of the ability readily to relocate a person, because the freedom of movement of a person enables them to move around the country and meet and communicate with a wider range of people. If somebody is a motivator of violent Islamists then their freedom to move around the country may allow them to motivate more than would otherwise be the case.</p> </blockquote> <p>Deputy assistant commissioner Stuart Osborne, of the Association of Chief Police Officers, told the same committee that control orders were a \u201cvery cost-effective way\u201d of dealing with terrorist suspects.

Clearly it is for Uefa to investigate this issue but we would expect tough sanctions. If we are going to stamp out racism from football, then it is no good giving derisory fines, as have been handed out in the past. It is not good enough to say that people should shake hands and forget about it.\u201d</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Teaching unions have reacted angrily to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/oct/17/michael-gove-baccalaureate-a-levels\">a report in the Times saying that Michael Gove plans to overhaul A-levels</a>.</strong> Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, said: \u201cThis is another example of Michael Gove\u2019s ideological manipulation of the school curriculum. These changes are being made on the basis of his own personal prejudices rather than developing a curriculum which is fit for children and young people in the 21st century.\u201d And Nansi Ellis, head of education policy and research, at the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL), said: \u201cIt\u2019s right that the secretary of state is considering the future of assessment for young people. However, he shows contempt for teachers, pupils and parents by once again discussing this with journalists before talking to those who will be affected by it, or those with the expertise to ensure a changed system works. This is piecemeal change, dreamt up by politicians, which means no-one is quite sure what will happen next.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/oct/17/gatwick-airport-second-runway\">Gatwick has declared its intent to push for a second runway and is to start drawing up detailed plans for government approval</a>.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/oct/17/social-workers-focus-crisis-cuts\">The Family and Parenting Institute has published a study showing that specialist social work aimed at helping at-risk families turn their lives around and avoid having their children taken into care is being undermined by cuts</a>.</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T13:42:57.353Z\">at 2.42pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-507ea2c558f91d7bbadac79d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T12:21:25.871Z\">1.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There was a significant announcement at PMQs. I'm afraid I missed it, because it came as I was writing up the end of the Cameron/Miliband exchanges, but others seem to have missed it too. Luckily it did not get through the Press Association net. Here is what it has filed.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>David Cameron announced today that energy firms will be forced to give customers the cheapest available tariff under new legislation. <br>Amid mounting concern about rocketing fuel bills, the prime minister signalled plans to introduce new laws to tackle the often-confusing array of tariffs. <br>\"I can announce that we will be legislating so that energy companies have to give the lowest tariff to their customers,\" he told MPs during Prime Minister's Questions. <br>His intervention follows a string of above-inflation price hikes by major energy companies in recent days.</p> </blockquote> <p>Ed Miliband said that Labour would force energy companies to offer the lowest tariffs to over-75s, but Cameron seems to be going further. </p> <p>I'll post more on this later.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507e9c7558f91d7bbadac79b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T11:54:29.682Z\">12.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>PMQs Verdict:</strong> David Cameron has said that Andrew Mitchell's behaviour was indefensible and - not surprisingly - he found it impossible to defend at PMQs. That's why Ed Miliband had the upper hand. The BBC has just pointed out that he slipped in his final question, saying that people were losing their jobs (when unemployment is going down - although technically there will still be some people losing their jobs), but that does not matter particularly, because his best soundbite (the double standards one, about the Carlton Club and a night in the cells) quite easily trumps Cameron's best soundbite (a lame one about Labour not having anything to say on the economy).</p> <p>That said, the exchanges were not that damaging to Cameron, and there was nothing in what he said, or in the way Tory MPs reacted, to suggest that Mitchell will have to resign. If anything, judging from the immediate reaction, he may well have passed the moment of most danger.</p> <p>(A conspiracy theorist might point out that this is exactly what Milband wants. Strategically, it is far more useful to Labour to have Mitchell in the cabinet, as a long-term reminder of Tory attitudes to public sector workers, than it would be to have Mitchell resign this week. But does that mean Miliband was somehow \"holding back\"? I doubt it. At PMQs it is hard to calibrate your performance with that degree of precision.)</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507e98c358f91d7bbadac799\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T11:38:43.377Z\">12.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Cameron says recent figures from the IMF show that there was a 5% structural deficit in 2007.

Employment is up, unemployment is down and the claimant count is down. There are more women in work than at any time in history. And the overall level of employment is higher than it was before the crash.</p> <p>Long-term unemployment is still too high. That's partly because of problems before the crash, he says.

But frankly, when the welfare bill is spiralling by over \u00a324 billion over this parliament, ministers are wrong to be breaking out the bunting. <br>There are now red flashing lights warning that Britain is becoming a very divided country. <br>Long-term unemployment has risen yet again. The number of young people out of work and claiming benefits for more than a year went up yet again, and three-quarters of Britain has higher unemployment than at the election. More than a third of people out of work have been jobless for more than a year in the clearest sign yet that the Work programme is not doing the job. <br>People in jobs are increasingly having to work part-time or on temporary contracts. There are 1.4 million people who are forced to work part time because they cannot find a full time job. <br>I\u2019m afraid the story is very simple. Those out of jobs are increasingly shut out. Those in jobs are increasingly insecure.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Brendan Barber</strong>, the TUC general secretary</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>These may be the best figures for some time, but we still need to do much, much better. There are still hundreds of thousands of young people without work, over a million people working part-time who want full time-jobs, and wages are still trailing below inflation.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>David Kern</strong>, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The latest job market figures are encouraging and support our assessment that the UK economy has returned to positive growth in the third quarter of 2012.</p> <p>The level of employment is at a record high, and the fall in the level of inactivity is a positive development, signalling that people are returning to the workforce.</p> <p>The strong trend in the labour market raises questions about the accuracy of GDP figures, which are still showing three consecutive declines over the period to the second quarter of 2012.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Paul Kenny</strong>, the GMB general secretary</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That there is mass unemployment, in the sixth year of recession, shows that the Tories and Liberals are following the wrong economic policies.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Dave Prentis</strong>, the Unison general secretary</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Any fall in unemployment has to be welcome, but there is no room for complacency around these figures. There are still 2.53 million people out of work and a near-record 1.4 million people who are being forced into part-time work when they need the income from a full-time job.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Len McCluskey</strong>, the Unite general secretary</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hidden behind the statistics is the stubborn underlying problem of the long-term unemployed, whether it is the 16-to-24 year olds or other groups seeking work. It is those areas that ministers need to concentrate on as a matter of urgency.<br>&#xa0;<br>The economy overall is flatlining, household incomes are being squeezed and demand has been sucked out of the economy.<br>&#xa0;<br>The UK is still in recession, so there is nothing for the government to crow about.</p> <p>The Joseph Rowntree Foundation reports that up to 66 people are chasing every retail job and last week when car giant, JLR offered 1,200 jobs, 20,000 people went for them \u2013 this means that there is hardly a jobs\u2019 Eldorado out there.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Chris Goulden</strong> from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While any fall in unemployment is welcome, the main problem for&#xa0;young people looking for work is fundamental \u2013 a major shortage of jobs. We need to ratchet up the quality of supply and demand together in order to have any impact on poverty.</p> <p>Today\u2019s unemployment figures show that 957,000 16\u201324 year olds are unemployed (not including those in full-time education). Despite fluctuations, this remains a long-term high, although \u2013 as cannot be repeated enough \u2013 the upward trend started long before the current recession, as far back as 2004.</p> <p>To get a job in these conditions, young people have to apply quickly and consistently to stand any chance. Even if they do hear back, then chances are that the job will be poorly paid and non-standard hours.</p> <p>Our research, <a href=\"http://www.jrf.org.uk/publications/disadvantaged-young-people-work\">published today</a>, shows looking for work for young people is a job in itself. It\u2019s time to increase skills and the number of decent jobs.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Tony Dolphin</strong>, chief economist at the IPPR</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today\u2019s figures are good news. They show further welcome falls in unemployment, which is good news especially for young people. There has clearly been an Olympic effect. Almost half of the rise in employment across England has been in London and a quarter of new jobs are temporary.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Matthew Oakley</strong>, head of economics and social policy at the Policy Exchange thinktank</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>These are an encouraging set of figures that emphasise the flexibility of the UK labour market. But we mustn\u2019t be complacent. Most of these new jobs are part-time or temporary and there is still an underlying problem that many people leaving jobseeker's allowance end up back on the dole within a year. To tackle this we must ensure that people moving off JSA think about increasing their hours, taking on more work and considering future jobs. Currently just one in ten part-time workers is looking for another job.</p> <p>Providing better support to claimants by reforming the way jobcentres are incentivised to get people into full time work is vital. So is the need to increase conditions on people - including those in part time and temporary work \u2013 to do all they possibly can to find full time employment and move off benefits.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>John Walker</strong>, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is good news that unemployment continues to fall, but the number of people that have been out of work for more than a year is growing. More than 45,000 new jobs could be created if the government were to extend the National Insurance contributions holiday and this would go a long way to helping those people find work.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Andrew Sissons</strong>, a researcher at The Work Foundation, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The strong job growth seen over the last year is finally beginning to translate into falling unemployment, especially among young people. While a drop in unemployment of 50,000 is relatively modest, the direction of travel is all important. If the economy keeps creating jobs at its current rate, we should begin to see more substantial falls in unemployment, potentially bringing it back under 2.5 million in the coming months.</p> <p>&#xa0;It is particularly encouraging to see youth unemployment falling, with an extra 50,000 young people moving into work, bringing the total back under one million. This suggests that the strength of the labour market is finally beginning to benefit younger workers. However, unemployment and inactivity among young people remains dangerously high, and more work is needed to sustain this trend.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T10:24:05.146Z\">at 11.24am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-507e7e7cc0e361310bc6d098\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T09:46:36.941Z\">10.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>You can read all today's Guardian politics stories <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/all\">here</a>.

So far, much of the party seems unaware of what\u2019s coming. Blairites, who mistakenly took the leader\u2019s conference speech as a shift to the centre, and Old Labourites, who wrongly detected a swerve to the Left, heard only what they wished to hear ...</p> <p>On welfare, the logic of one nationism would seem to favour a contributory system in which those who pay their dues get the most back. The very fairness of such measures would, some argue, engender compassion. As others protest that such a change would imperil the poorest, a row simmers within the party. On crime, the common good is unlikely to be best served by a Tory crackdown that will drain the public purse, hamper rehabilitation and so make citizens less safe. Will Mr Miliband dare say so?</p> <p>On the clearest part of his prospectus \u2013 muscling in on the conservatism abandoned by the Tories \u2013 Mr Miliband will promise, like a one-man Unesco, to preserve Britain\u2019s heritage and institutions. The danger is that pledges to conserve the NHS may backfire once it becomes clear that destruction, including hospital closures, is the only realistic route to salvation.</p> <p>The sole certainty is that Labour has not got the leader it expected. Blairites wanted a continuity regime, the Left expected reassurance, and the unions hoped for a poodle. All those comfort zones will be vaporised in the white heat of Mr Miliband\u2019s one-nation furnace. Quite what will emerge from the fireball is unclear, but there is no doubting the scope of his ambition.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://labourlist.org/2012/10/eds-going-to-tough-with-the-party-how-exactly/\">Mark Ferguson has responded with a post at LabourList, saying that he is sceptical about whether Miliband\u2019s proposals really will upset his party as much as Riddell suggests.</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/article3570338.ece\">\u2022 Alastair Campbell in the Times says politicians must understand the power of social media.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The speed of change is breathtaking. Facebook, founded in 2004, recently recorded its one billionth devotee. YouTube, created in 2005, now has more videos uploaded in one month than three US TV networks created in 60 years.

The number of British people on Twitter \u2014 10 million \u2014 has overtaken the number buying a daily newspaper ...</p> <p>In an era when people believe politicians and journalists less than they used to, they still believe each other.

Liberal democracies can only exist with informed citizens. This is an axiom but one that requires repetition.

Right across the world, the transparency agenda will see journalists as well as citizens gaining access to unprecedented amounts of data. The media has a unique role. Journalists need to engage with this data to expose waste, incompetence and corruption wherever they see it. That\u2019s why I\u2019m issuing a call to arms to the media the world over to hold the feet of government officials and ministers like me to the fire.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/borrowing/loans/9613729/Loan-firms-wonga-buys-the-ears-of-ministers.html\">\u2022 Tim Ross and Rowena Mason in the Daily Telegraph say Conservative ministers agreed to hold meetings with Wonga in return for payments to the party.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The meetings took place at the Tory Party conference last week despite the new party chairman, Grant Shapps, previously describing the activities of some payday lenders as \u201cobscene\u201d.</p> <p>A Cabinet source privately admitted that \u201cmoneymaking\u201d was a key goal of this year\u2019s conference, with companies paying thousands for exhibition stands and events.

He said that \u201ctransitional protection\u201d, which would be maintained \u201cindefinitely on a cash basis\u201d, would ensure that disabled people did not lose money. And he said they would actually benefit from universal credit.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There\u2019s a confusion going on there between what\u2019s happening to disability living allowance and what\u2019s happening to universal credit. The point about universal credit is that it\u2019s massively helpful to people who have got disabilities in the workplace, because it allows them to take flexible jobs, there\u2019s not the tyranny of the 16-hour rule, they don\u2019t have to worry about fluctuating conditions, they will enjoy much more generous disregards. So, the package as a whole is one of the best things possible for people with disabilities.</p> </blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve taken the quotes from <a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com\">PoliticsHome.</a></p> <p>There are two main items on the agenda for today.</p> <p><em>9.30am:</em> Unemployment figures are published.</p> <p><em>12pm:</em> David Cameron and Ed Miliband clash at PMQs.</p> <p>As usual, I'll also be covering all the breaking political news as well as looking at the papers and bringing you the best politics from the web.

  "<p>President Barack Obama sounded good in his second election debate with Republican challenger Mitt Romney. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/obama-win-second-presidential-debate?intcmp=122\" title=\"\">But he looked good, too</a>. Watching these debates is a lesson in the power of visual communication. It is the way the rival candidates stand, smile and move, as much as their arguments, that tell us who they are.</p> <p>Obama's powerful comeback performance after his dismal first debate made excellent use of his looks, his style, his slender figure. He managed to upstage his opponent just by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/second-presidential-debate-video-clips\" title=\"\">the way he sat on a stool or listened to Romney speak with a quizzical, drily amused look</a>. His biggest personal asset is his smile. In this debate, he used it to brilliant effect by <a href=\"http://p.nowthisnews.com/entry/200/\" title=\"\">grinning charmingly even as he delivered his most aggressive putdowns against Romney</a>.</p> <p>This is why reviews of the debate that, in striving for objectivity or attempting to undermine what was a clear victory for Obama, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/us-election/9613882/US-presidential-debate-Barack-Obama-fights-back-against-Mitt-Romney.html\" title=\"\">stress its \"aggression\"</a>, are getting it wrong. This was an extremely confronational encounter \u2013 <a href=\"http://p.nowthisnews.com/entry/192/\" title=\"\">both men were effectively calling each other liars</a> \u2013 but the president did not come over as unduly aggressive, because his relaxed appearance balanced his <a href=\"http://p.nowthisnews.com/entry/195/\" title=\"\">barbed words</a>. This is why he was able to get laughs from the audience, which Romney could not achieve.</p> <p>Do appearances matter in politics? Of course they do. US presidential debates were the stage on which that fact of modern public life was first made visible. In 1960, <a href=\"http://www.history.com/topics/kennedy-nixon-debates\" title=\"\">Republican candidate Richard Nixon stood against Democrat John F Kennedy</a>; their televised debates were a disaster for Nixon. He sweated profusely and people though he looked shifty. Meanwhile, JFK \u2026 was JFK.</p> <p>Romney did not sweat this week, nor did he crumble as Nixon did 52 years ago. The surprise of this US election is that, after the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-16416324\" title=\"\">far-right freakshow of the Republican nominations race</a>, Romney is a comparatively moderate candidate (on some issues) with a <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-romney-massachusetts-record-20121003,0,1950072.story\" title=\"\">bipartisan track record as former governor of Massachusetts</a>, which is not exactly Texas.</p> <p>But in their second debate, Obama made him look old and square. Romney started to <a href=\"http://p.nowthisnews.com/entry/199/\" title=\"\">seem more plastic and sound more synthesised</a>. Sometimes, appearances are truthful. It was not a flashy, contrived PR image that brought the president back into the race as he seeks a second term: it was an aura of authenticity. His visual self-presentation was powerful, stern and moving as he <a href=\"http://p.nowthisnews.com/entry/201/\" title=\"\">denounced his opponent's \"offensive\" remarks on Libya</a>.</p> <p>He looked, literally, an upright man. Democrats must hope that visual impression stays in voters' minds.</p>",

  "<p>The Guardian <a href=\"http://election.tumblr.com/\">collaborated with Tumblr on another live-giffing</a> of the presidential debate on Thursday night. This time there was no Joe Biden \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/12/joe-biden-paul-ryan-vp-debate-gif-recap\">God's gift to gifs</a> \u2013 but it was still a strong night. Here's the best moments:</p> <h2>The adorable</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mc0j1iArd71rg2rf7o1_500.gif\"> <img src=\"https://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mc0j1iArd71rg2rf7o1_500.gif\" WIDTH=\"460\"/> </figure>  <p>The night's first question came from Jeremy, a junior in college who was perhaps even more endearing than <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=bluth+%2B+micahel+cerra&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a#hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=5qK&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US%3Aofficial&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=george-michael+bluth&amp;oq=george-michael+bluth&amp;gs_l=serp.3..0i10l4.3313.3458.2.3679.2.2.0.0.0.1.258.258.2-1.1.0.les%3B..0.0...1c.1.TOLzh4eW6wQ&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;fp=300041258250aab3&amp;bpcl=35277026&amp;biw=1870&amp;bih=791\">George Michael Bluth</a>. Someone give this kid a job.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://movieclips.com/nT9Bx-west-side-story-movie-ready-to-rumble/\">The rumble</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mc0jxtdJrh1rg2rf7o1_500.gif\"> <img src=\"https://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mc0jxtdJrh1rg2rf7o1_500.gif\" WIDTH=\"460\" /> </figure>  <p>From the off, both candidates were aggressive, setting the tone for the rest of the night. One of the most awkward encounters occurred early on, when Obama and Romney charged towards each another, each attempting to make a point. For a second or two it looked like there would be blood, but thankfully Candy stepped in.</p> <h2>The moderator</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mc0j5diWCg1rg2rf7o1_400.gif\"> <img src=\"https://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mc0j5diWCg1rg2rf7o1_400.gif\" /> </figure>  <p>Despite a few admirable parries, Candy Crowley struggled to control the candidates. She was no Jim Lehrer, but her performance was further confirmation that Martha Raddatz is simply a badass. If we follow the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=raddatz&amp;src=typd\">will of the internet,</a> Raddatz will be moderating the next one. Crowley's best moment came when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/16/obama-romney-second-debate-live#block-507e160658f91d7bbadac749\">she fact-checked Romney over Libya, live on air</a>.</p> <h2>The tired</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mc0jpeuLww1rg2rf7o1_r1_500.gif\"> <img src=\"https://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mc0jpeuLww1rg2rf7o1_r1_500.gif\" WIDTH=\"460\" /> </figure>  <p> Obama was certainly more animated than the first debate, but Joe from Islip wasn't impressed.</p> <h2>The binder full of women</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mc0lwdHHNQ1rg2rf7o1_500.gif\"> <img src=\"https://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mc0lwdHHNQ1rg2rf7o1_500.gif\" WIDTH=\"460\"/> </figure>  <p> One of the night's indisputable gems was Romney's response to a question about how he tried to diversify his cabinet when governor of Massachusetts. Romney said <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/16/obama-romney-second-debate-live#block-507e0d90c0e361310bc6d059\">\"they brought me binders full of women,\"</a> a line that managed to simultaneously alienate half of the nation and make everyone forget about Big Bird.</p> <h2>The 'oh no you didn't' moment'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mc0mdlE9qx1rg2rf7o1_400.gif\"> <img src=\"https://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mc0mdlE9qx1rg2rf7o1_400.gif\" WIDTH=\"460\"/> </figure>  <p> You're sayin' what about Benghazi? </p> <h2>The takeaway</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mc0lucxSNK1rg2rf7o1_500.gif\"> <img src=\"https://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mc0lucxSNK1rg2rf7o1_500.gif\" WIDTH=\"460\"/> </figure>  <p><br>So who won? As tends to be the case with debates it depends on who you ask. If there's any consensus, it was that there was an intense personal hostility between Romney and Obama. These guys seem to genuinely hate each other. It's enough to make one miss the carefree days of Herman Cain.</p>",
  "<p>President Obama brought his A-game to the debate Tuesday evening. After demurring in the first presidential debate, this Obama was hardhitting and unwilling to cede ground to Mitt Romney. There were many exciting moments, but will any of them move the polls? </p> <p>An immediate look at the post-debate \"insta\" snapshots suggest that a gain for the president is possible. The <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57533850/poll-obama-edges-romney-in-second-debate/?tag=MaxDeep;HeroImage\">CBS/Knowledge Networks</a> poll of undecided voters had Obama winning the debate 37% to 30%. A <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2012/10/colorado-voters-give-obama-narrow-victory-in-debate.html\">Public Policy Polling</a> survey of debate watchers in the swing state of Colorado gave Obama a 48% to 44% edge. A <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/16/breaking-cnn-poll-obama-edges-romney-in-debate/\">CNN/ORC</a> nationwide poll of debate watchers pegged Obama the winner 46% to 39%. </p> <p>These wins are solid, especially considering that debate watchers tend to be a few more points Republican. They suggest that, if nothing else, it's unlikely that Obama will lose ground. The question as to whether he will gain any is more in doubt. </p> <p>First, it's important to remember that a lot of the movement after the debates is about the <a href=\"http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/10/02/why-news-coverage-of-the-debate-may-matter-more-than-the-debate/\">media spin</a>. There can be little doubt when watching, listening to and reading the media that they are ready to declare that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/obama-win-second-presidential-debate\">Obama was back in style</a>. The issue is that many sources also seemed to suggest that, in the words of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chucktodd/status/258396461845315584\">NBC's Chuck Todd</a>, \"Romney seemed to be ready for it.\" That would seem to suggest more of a tie than anything else. </p> <p>The question over whether this narrative becomes a solid Obama victory will likely revolve around video playback of the many confrontations between the candidates. One, in particular, stood out \u2013 regarding Libya and whether the terrorist attacks on the US consul to Libya and others in Benghazi were or were not called a terrorist act by President Obama. It was a crucial moment in the debate and Obama claimed that he'd said on 12 September that it was a terrorist attack, while Romney disagreed. Moderator Candy Crowley, acting as impromptu fact-checker, mostly sided with Obama. The showdown left a \"mark\" on Romney, said Todd.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/10/16/fact-check-did-obama-really-call-consulate-attack-in-libya-act-terror/\">whole truth is fuzzier</a> than the debate let on. In his 12cSeptember remarks in the Rose Garden, Obama did use the word \"terror\", but he didn't refer specifically to the events in Benghazi when using the word. This has become <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/mckaycoppins/romney-campaign-will-litigate-libya\">a focal point</a> in a lot of post-debate discussion \u2013 and Republicans have fought back hard. How the media handles this Libya question and the American people's response could be key in determining \"who won\" the debate as a whole.</p> <p>Second, Obama's victory this time around doesn't match the scale of Romney's from the first debate in the polls. Romney won that debate by a recording-breaking 42 points in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/04/mitt-romney-won-debate-win-election\">CNN poll</a> and took undecideds by 24 points in the <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57525698/poll-uncommitted-voters-say-romney-wins-debate/?pageNum=2&amp;tag=page\">CBS survey</a>. We also know that respondents in the CNN poll \u2013 by an 18 percentage point margin \u2013 were more likely to say they would vote for Romney over Obama thanks to the first debate, compared to a tie on this question after the second debate.</p> <p>And despite these massive wins, Romney picked up a comparatively small <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/08/romney-debate-bounce-real-but-fading\">4 points nationally</a>. We can therefore try to determine how a smaller Obama win in the second debate insta-polls might predict how much ground he will gain. The ratio of winning the debate and picking up national support from the first debate was along the lines of 10.5 (a 42-point debate victory margin over a 4-point ultimate gain) in the CNN poll, and 6 (a 24-point debate victory margin over a 4-point ultimate gain) in the CBS poll.</p> <p>If these ratios hold for the second debate and given Obama's insta-poll margins, then Obama should gain, maybe, a single point nationally. This is not rigorous exercise, but suggests that Obama doesn't stand to gain too much ground. </p> <p>Third, it's unlikely that this debate will deflate Republican enthusiasm. Perhaps the biggest gains for Romney after the first debate came because he was able to take an already wide likely/registered voter gap and expand it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/10/romney-v-obama-mixed-signals-polls\">just a bit</a>. There's nothing in the data to suggest that Republicans were deflated by this performance. They are, for instance, standing strong with Romney on the Benghazi attacks, which tends to support the idea that Romney didn't do poorly so much as Obama did well. </p> <p>Fourth, Democratic enthusiasm will hold thanks to this debate, yet it likely never dropped. If you had any Democratic friends, you probably saw a few who held their heads low after the first debate. You probably saw more hardcore Democrats, however, who offered an impassioned defense of the president. The polls reflect that. After the first debate, Public Policy Polling surveyed Virginia and Wisconsin voters and found that Democratic enthusiasm was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/12/joe-biden-teeth-paul-ryan-hair\">stable compared to pre-debate</a>. I guess it's possible that Democrats are more enthusiastic than ever, thanks to this debate, but I think the post-convention/pre-debate Democratic enthusiasm is as high as it's going to get. That means the registered/likely voter gap will remain. </p> <p>Fifth, Romney must remain favorable to the American public and probably will. Before the first debate, Romney was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/30/mitt-romney-fault-loses\">seen unfavorably</a> by much of the American public. That <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/obama_romney_favorable_unfavorable.html\">changed dramatically</a> thanks to the first showdown. Obama, on the other hand, has had his favorable ratings stay relatively consistent for months. This suggests that Romney's gains were due to perceptions of Romney, less than they were due to Obama's performance.</p> <p>If that hypothesis is correct, then Obama probably can't gain back voters with a good performance. Romney can only lose them with a bad one. There's not a lot in the numbers to suggest he did. </p> <p>So, I'm not expecting much, if any, movement from this debate. If it does occur, it will be favorable towards President Obama. He'll take that, in this tight race, as every little bit counts. But remember that predictions about post-debate movements are not perfect and that any movements or lack thereof could be erased by <em>next week</em>'s debate.</p>",

It's fair to say the second presidential debate <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/17/obama-win-second-presidential-debate?intcmp=122\" title=\"\">did not go Romney's way</a>.</p> <p>The delicious irony is that the phrase was supposed to show us Romney the feminist. As governor of Massachusetts, he explained: \"We took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet. I went to a number of women's groups and said: 'Can you help us find folks?' and they brought us whole binders full of women.\"</p> <p>Instead, he managed to conjure an image confirming every feminist's worst fears about a Romney presidency; that he views women's rights in the workplace as so much business admin, to be punched and filed and popped on a shelf. Worse still, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/oct/17/romney-debate-binders-of-women-video\" title=\"\">it was irrelevant to the question he'd actually been asked</a>, about pay inequality.

The list was compiled before he even took office. It wasn't just a gaffe: it was a Freudian slip, a filibuster and a falsehood.</p> <p>It also wasn't even the daftest part of his answer. That would have to be this bizarre promise: \"We're going to have to have employers in the new economy, in the economy I'm going to bring to play, that are going to be so anxious to get good workers they're going to be anxious to hire women.\"</p> <p>So anxious, they'll hire women. Subtext: so desperate, they'll hire anyone. Even you, ladies. The implication being that in Romney's dream economy employers will grind their teeth and chew their nails until, in a lengthy silence at the tenth tense board meeting, one brave executive tentatively suggests \"Guys, I hate to say it, but I think we need to hire people without penises.\"</p> <p>Again, not only is it stupid, but it's addressing a question no one has asked. The problem is that women are paid less for the same jobs, not that the labour market isn't flooded enough for employers to take a charitable gamble on them.</p> <p>Romney's attempt to paint himself as a feminist only proved he doesn't know what the word means. That's why whole binders full of women won't be voting for him. And it's why it's now 219,270 likes.</p>",
  "<p>Jacob Susman is frustrated again. Sitting in the bright green conference room of his company's trendy industrial office, overshadowed by the Brooklyn Bridge, he's a clean-cut poster child for the \"green economy\": Since 2007, Susman's OwnEnergy, which installs wind turbines, has grown to be one of the nation's most prominent wind installers. But he's plagued by a recurring nightmare: \"Every few years the industry has to drop everything for six or nine months and focus exclusively on having the credit passed.\"</p> <p>He's talking about the Production Tax Credit, the federal subsidy for renewable energy that gives a 2.2-cent per kilowatt hour break to wind energy producers. Those pennies add up to about <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/21/business/energy-environment/as-a-tax-credit-wanes-jobs-vanish-in-wind-power-industry.html?pagewanted=all\">$1 billion per year</a>, no chump change for the burgeoning industry. Proponents of wind energy say since its inception in 1992, the PTC has been a crucial driving force behind the industry's rapid growth; critics of the PTC (including the fossil-fuel funded <a href=\"http://www.americanenergyalliance.org/2012/09/pyle-its-time-for-the-wind-ptc-to-end/\">American Energy Alliance</a>) say the industry has had ample time to take off its training wheels (never mind that fossil fuel subsidies historically <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/469723-energy-subsidies.html\">run about 13 times higher</a> than renewables).</p> <p>The subsidy has become a touchstone issue in the presidential campaign for <a href=\"http://www.eenews.net/public/EEDaily/2012/08/01/1\">windy swing states</a> like Iowa and Colorado: Mitt Romney has referred to the PTC as a <a href=\"http://www.eenews.net/public/EEDaily/2012/07/31/1\">\"stimulus boondoggle\"</a> and vowed to kill it, while President Obama has promised to <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/morningenergy/0812/morningenergy557.html\">give the credit</a> his support. Every one to three years, as the PTC reaches its expiration date, it must be taken up, re-debated, re-tweaked, and re-approved by Congress, exposing it to shifting political whims particularly in a general election year where the future party spread is far from certain.</p> <p>The PTC is set to expire at the end of this year, and uncertainty about whether Congress will extend it has led to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/21/business/energy-environment/as-a-tax-credit-wanes-jobs-vanish-in-wind-power-industry.html?pagewanted=all\">layoffs and much anxiety</a> in the industry. And while 2012 was a big year for wind, with 10 gigawatts installed nationwide by August and another gigawatt predicted by year's end (only 0.9 percent of total new power in the US, but nearly double the wind installed in 2011), projections for 2013 are grim: Estimates range from half to a tenth of that.</p> <p>\"Next year is already going to be a crash year for the wind industry,\" said Michel DiCapua, an analyst with Bloomberg Energy Finance.</p> <p>But what happens next year is only the next iteration of a boom-bust cycle that has been the bane of the US wind industry for over a decade. The PTC has been allowed to expire three times in the past, and the industry has consistently tanked; even the <em>possibility</em> of expiration sends shivers up the spines of everyone from blue-collar factory workers to Manhattan investors. Breaking free of that cycle, Susman and other industry leaders interviewed by <em>Climate Desk</em> agree, is the industry's only hope for sustained long-term growth, and it starts with weaning the industry off the PTC once and for all.</p> <p></p> <p>\"The industry doesn't need the PTC forever,\" Susman said. \"We're ready to start talking about how to phase it down.\"</p> <p>But they still have a ways to go. Thanks to fracking, natural gas prices are through the floor. Although the cost of power from wind has <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/469722-2011-wind-technologies-market-report.html\">dropped 90 percent</a> since 1980, some investors are still spooked by the upfront expenses. And aside from a few exceptions, the state-level standards that mandate how much renewable energy must be brought into the mix are too low and thus oversupplied, meaning there's little incentive for utilities to seek out new wind projects. For those reasons, a swath of groups including the <a href=\"http://www.awea.org/newsroom/pressreleases/BICEPrelease.cfm\">American Wind Energy Association</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/smart-energy-solutions/increase-renewables/production-tax-credit-for.html\">Union of Concerned Scientists</a> have been pushing hard for Congress to extend the PTC once again.</p> <p>Still, said Andy Bowman of Austin-based wind installer Pioneer Green Energy, \"I do think there's more speculation than there ever has been that this might be the last extension.\" Bowman agreed with Susman that even worse than competing on uneven ground with fossil fuels was being handcuffed to a mercurial legislative process whose sights rarely reach farther than a few years. \"It's miserable,\" he said. \"All the projects we've been working on for the last three years are hanging in the balance.\"</p> <p>Bowman is among the wind industry veterans who have worked through several boom-bust cycles in the past. With just 14 employees, his small company is at the mercy of venture capitalists who are loathe to back any enterprise that lacks long-term stability; the PTC, he said, has never been more than a piecemeal solution.</p> <p>\"The expiration of the PTC casts a long shadow,\" he said. \"Removing it would provide a great deal more certainty, since we wouldn't have this big question mark.\"</p> <p>Industry leaders are counting on a combination of <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/richardfinger/2012/07/22/were-headed-to-8-00-natural-gas/2/\">rising natural gas prices</a>, tightening coal regulations, and ever-cheaper and more efficient turbines to give wind the competitive edge it would need to kick the PTC. They're also lobbying for a far-sighted national energy policy that favors wind, and higher targets for states' renewables goals. But it's not clear how long those goals will really take to achieve. So for now, all they can do is cross their fingers for one more shot.</p> <p>\"We're seeing the light at the end of the tunnel,\" Susman said. \"Wind should be able to stand on its own in a few years.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was first published by Guardian partner, <a href=\"http://climatedesk.org/2012/10/big-winds-recurring-nightmare/\">Climate Desk</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>Hi Suranga, can you tell us a little bit more about </strong><a href=\"http://www.blinkx.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>blinkx</strong></a><strong> and your role there as chief strategy officer?</strong></p> <p>Before I started blinkx, I was the US chief technology officer for <a href=\"http://www.autonomy.com/\" title=\"\">Autonomy</a> having moved to San Francisco from Cambridge. I was bitten by the consumer technology bug that affects many who live in and around Silicon Valley, and launched blinkx seven years ago, building it up to what it is now: the world's largest and most advanced video search engine and a company with annual sales of over $100m.</p> <p>Strange as it may seem, I recently stepped down as CEO of the company in order to take the position of chief strategy officer so that I could really focus on what I'm most passionate about at blinkx \u2013 innovation, ideas and implementation in what I believe to be the future of video online.</p> <p><strong>What does an average day look like for you?</strong></p> <p>The clich\u00e9 here is that there's no such thing, and it's true of me too. I spend most of time split between wildly different places and/or time zones \u2013 with customers (mainly New York and London), investors (primarily London) and working on our future product and technology (San Francisco and Cambridge). That said, I place a lot of value in spending time with people that matter, internal or external, in person. Some of the best professional relationships I've struck up have had their genesis over dinner and a long chat that didn't have an agenda.</p> <p><strong>What are the biggest challenges to your job and how do you overcome them?</strong></p> <p>I've come to see most challenges as being problems of balance. For example, you want to build process and structure to run the business efficiently but, if you do that too much, you kill opportunity for creativity, which means you don't innovate fast enough. You want to maximize today's revenue and profits because that will deliver shareholder value in the short term, but if you focus only on that, you won't invest enough in the future, and that will disappoint the same shareholders in the long term.</p> <p>I also think that technology has created an information overload for all of us; it's important to learn what to filter out so you can see the big picture.</p> <p><strong>What's do you think is the key to building a successful startup?</strong></p> <p>It has more to do with a certain mentality. My mentor, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/may/24/autonomy-mike-lynch-leave-hewlett-packard\" title=\"\">Mike Lynch</a>, has said that great entrepreneurs must have an obsessive personality disorder \u2013 and be focused on the details with a level of energy that's more than a little irrational. As a CEO you need to bring a lot of positive energy to the table. I had a meeting with our core tech team seven years ago and discussed a possible valuation of our company at around $50m. Everyone round the table sniggered at the thought we could possibly ever be that big, yet we've now been worth more than 10 times that. Getting people to think big is as much about psychology as it is about actual skill or expertise.</p> <p><strong>What online resources can you not do your job without?</strong></p> <p>Anything and everything. While I do follow all the obvious magazines and publications, I also love randomly picking up on something new \u2014 Twitter has become a great resource for those slightly more random discoveries that take you out of your own echo-chamber.</p> <p><strong>What in search and video is exciting you the most at the moment?</strong></p> <p>Ubiquitous, mobile connectivity fascinates me. We really do have the ability to be connected at all times and in all places, and I don't think we've even begun to scratch the surface on what that can achieve. Augmented reality means that you'll soon have a contact lens that privately displays a reminder of previous meetings and conversations every time you meet someone and shake their hand, so none of us will ever make comments about not being good at faces. Multi-device, single-identity technology means that most electronic objects will be connected; even today, with the new <a href=\"http://www.blinkx.com/\" title=\"\">blinkx.com</a> for example, you can start watching a show on your phone on the bus, hit pause, walk through your front door, turn on the telly and see the same show frozen at precisely the same point in time.</p> <p><strong>Where do you see search in the next 5 years?</strong></p> <p>I think we'll continue to see more intelligent search that is delivered automatically and contextually, rather than depending on a keyword prompt in the first place. Already, when I go to the Yelp app on my phone, it defaults to shops, cafes, restaurants and so on that are near me. In ten years time there may be no search \u2013 it will just be a seamless connection of information and services based on really smart context analysis; in five years we'll hopefully be part of the way there!</p> <p><strong>What 3 top tips would you give to a media professional looking to get to where you are?</strong></p> <p>1. Embrace maths: Whether you see this as a good or bad thing, advertising and the media are becoming extremely quantitative \u2013 if you've shied away from maths so far, get your head out of the sand, read about it and understand it</p> <p>2. Look to the kids: We're all getting older, and faster. Use your networks (kids, younger siblings etc) to really pay attention to how people younger than you are using, consuming and controlling their media</p> <p>3. Have a think week: Bill Gates famously took a week or two off every year and shut himself on a deserted island somewhere and read stuff properly and thought about the bigger picture. Book a day or two out of the office at some point so that you really can drop the day-to-day stuff and think about the bigger picture</p> <p><strong>Any last words?</strong></p> <p>When it comes to entrepreneurship, imagining new products, creating new markets and chasing that dream of becoming a David disrupting the Goliaths, I think it's really important to realise that you won't achieve anything if you don't actually DO anything.</p> <p>It's easy to be negative, to explain why things won't work and to get caught in analysis paralysis. In summary, I'll borrow from one of the world's finest brands: Just do it.</p> <p><em>Suranga Chandratillake is founder and president of </em><a href=\"http://www.blinkx.com/\" title=\"\"><em>blinkx</em></a><em> </em></p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/media-network/start.php\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up for free membership</strong></a><strong> to the </strong><a href=\"http://guardian.co.uk/media-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Media Network</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the French president, has warned for the first time that the Paris-Berlin motor driving Europe could stall over deep differences on how to resolve the euro crisis, insisting on a climbdown by Angela Merkel in her emphasis on austerity and the surrender of national powers to tighten fiscal discipline.</p> <p>Giving the Guardian his first British newspaper interview since becoming president in May, Hollande said there was light at the end of the eurozone tunnel, but he also:</p> <p>\u2022 suggested Merkel was too preoccupied with domestic politics in her response to the crisis</p> <p>\u2022 demanded Berlin reverse its opposition to decisions taken by eurozone leaders in June</p> <p>\u2022 called on the eurozone to act promptly to bring down the costs of borrowing for Spain and Italy</p> <p>\u2022 insisted Greece be assured of staying in the eurozone</p> <p>\u2022 gave short shrift to a German push for the creation of a federalised eurozone or political union</p> <p>\u2022 and dismissed as unfounded the strong German criticisms of the recent moves on the crisis by the European Central Bank.</p> <p>While the Franco-German relationship was the driving and \"accelerating\" force of the EU, Hollande said, \"it can also be the brake if it's not in step. Hence the need for Franco-German coherence.\"</p> <p>Hollande's remarks on the eve of a crucial EU summit in Brussels highlighted the extent of the gulf between Paris and Berlin and the deep divisions within the eurozone almost three years into Europe's worst ever crisis.</p> <h2>Solidarit\u00e9</h2> <p>Interviewed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/series/europa?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">the Guardian and five other European newspapers</a> from France, Germany, Spain, Italy and Poland, Hollande also called for monthly meetings of the national leaders of the 17 eurozone countries to end the cycle of \"so-called 'last-chance' summits\", which he said in the past had led only to \"fleeting successes\".</p> <p>He said domestic electoral considerations should not get in the way of solving the euro-crisis. Merkel \"is very sensitive to questions of internal politics and to the demands of her parliament. I understand that, and can respect that. But we all have our own public opinion. Our common responsibility is to put Europe's interests first.\"</p> <p>France's first socialist president for 17 years also rejected the idea that Germany was the only nation putting its hand in its pocket for everyone else.</p> <p>\"We're all taking part in this solidarity. The French, the Germans, just like all the Europeans in the ESM [the eurozone's new rescue fund]. Let's stop thinking that there's only one country who's going to pay for the others. That's false. However, I know the sensitivity of our German friends to the problem of supervision. Whoever pays should control, whoever pays should sanction. I agree. But budgetary union should be completed by a partial mutualisation of debts through eurobonds.\"</p> <p>Hollande's assertion of the need for the eurozone to pool some of its debt through eurobonds challenged one of Merkel's red lines. She has repeatedly refused to countenance the proposal and there is scant chance of her shifting that position as she moves into an election year.</p> <p>\"We are near, very near, to an end to the eurozone crisis,\" said Hollande. But decisions taken at the last EU summit in June had to be implemented \"as fast as possible\".</p> <h2>No Grexit</h2> <p>In June, EU leaders delivered a breakthrough deal, agreeing to make the European Central Bank the first supervisor of the eurozone's banks and to use the bailout funds to shore up weak banks directly rather than by lending the funds to governments. But Berlin is dragging its heels on the deal and last month shattered the confidence of its partners by walking away from the agreement.</p> <p>Hollande insisted that the so-called \"banking union\" had to be finalised by the end of the year. He is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/14/europe-franco-german-tussle-brussels?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">demanding a German climbdown</a> on the issue at the summit on Thursday and Friday.</p> <p>Echoing calls by the Spanish and Italian governments for German support to bring down the costs of their borrowing in the bond markets, Hollande said they should be able to finance themselves at \"reasonable\" rates, and added it was unfair some eurozone countries were borrowing at 1% and others at 7%.</p> <p>The Greek situation had to be dealt with \"definitively\" as \"Greece has made so much effort and it must now be assured of staying in the eurozone\".</p> <p>\"In the interests of all you can't inflict perpetual punishment on countries that have already made considerable efforts,\" he said.</p> <p>For Hollande, the urgency of dealing with the crisis had to take priority over longer-term German-led calls for eurozone federation and political union. Only once immediate measures were taken could Europe look at changing its way of decision-making and \"deepening its union\". He suggested that political union \u2013 so dear to the Germans \u2013 would be on the backburner until after the 2014 European parliament elections.</p> <p>Crucially, he warned against the issue of political union being used as a distraction to dodge difficult choices.</p> <p>\"The institutional issue is often evoked in order to avoid making choices. It hasn't escaped my notice that those quickest to talk of political union were often those the most reticent to take urgent decisions&#xa0;\u2026\"</p> <p>Challenged that he specifically meant the Germans, he said: \"No, I'm not pointing at anyone in particular.\" But he added: \"Several times in the past, they [Germany] had sincerely made proposals on political union. Those were not picked up.\"</p> <h2>Read my lips: no new treaty</h2> <p>Outlining his recipe for tackling the crisis, Hollande called on Germany to help rebalance the eurozone economy by cutting taxes and raising wages to spur domestic demand and proposed policies sharply at variance with Berlin in terms of timing and sequencing.</p> <p>\"Solidarity\" had to come first followed by deeper integration, he emphasised. \"Whenever we take a step towards solidarity, the union \u2013 which means the respect of common rules around governance \u2013 should progress.\" He said the banking union was a very important role. \"That solidarity can't go without democratic control. The banking union aimed at controlling finance would be an important step in European integration.\"</p> <p>The German strategy, by contrast, is to insist on tighter, centralised controls of budgets and fiscal policies and then to move towards a pooling of liabilities for banks and debt once the new system is operational and seen to be working.</p> <p>Asked whether in order for a more integrated political union it might be necessary to draw up a new European treaty and put it to referendums, Hollande shot back with a reference to the no vote on the European constitution in France in 2005. \"If I remember rightly, we tried that formula in 2005 and it didn't produce the results we were hoping for. Because before launching into institutional mechanics, Europeans must know what they want to do together. The content is more important than the framework,\" he said.</p> <p>He insisted France would \"tirelessly\" champion the growth agenda \u2013 \"this compromise between getting out of debt and growth\" \u2013 without questioning the need for budget discipline, which had been made \"absolutely necessary\" by the sovereign debt crisis. \"Today, recession is as big a threat as deficits.\"</p> <h2>Brits on the backfoot</h2> <p>Hollande said his approach was \"a Europe that advances at varying speeds, with different circles. We could call them 'avant garde', 'precursor states', the 'core' \u2013 names don't matter, it's the idea that counts.\" This meant strengthening the regular meetings of eurozone governments.</p> <p>. He said the leaders of other countries intending to join the single currency could also take part in his proposed monthly summits of eurozone national leaders, but on less than equal terms, as \"associates\". But, in an implicit nod to David Cameron and other non-euro zone countries not to interfere if they were standing outside, he added: \"Certain countries don't want to join [the eurozone]: that's their choice. But why should they come telling us how the eurozone should be run? It's a pretension I hear but that I don't think meets the need for coherence.\"</p> <p>Asked if he would risk seeing Britain leave Europe, Hollande said: \"I would like a UK fully engaged in Europe, but I can't decide in place of the British. I see that for the moment they want to be more in retreat. The British are tied by the accords they have signed up to. They can't detach from them. At least they have the merit of clarity. They aren't in the eurozone or budgetary union. I don't intend to force them.\"</p> <p>The suggestion that Britain couldn't wriggle out of deals it had signed up to could be seen in London as a signal that it would not be easy for the UK to renegotiate binding European commitments in a way Cameron would like to.</p> <p>Asked what was the biggest threat to the European Union, Hollande suggested it was \"not being loved. Only being seen at best as an austere cash dispenser or at worse as a reform school.\"</p> <p>In a message to Germany that France would stand by the others, he said. \"France is the bridge between northern Europe and southern Europe. I refuse any division. If Europe has been reunified, it's not for it to then fall into egotism or 'each for one's own'. Our duty is to set common rules around the principles of responsibility and solidarity. As a French person, it's for me to ensure Europeans are conscious of belonging to the same group.\"</p> <p>Asked if he had said that to Angela Merkel, he said: \"She knows it perfectly. That was the meaning of her trip to Athens\".</p> <p>He said: \"I'll do everything for Greece to stay in the euro and have the resources it needs by the end of the year, without it having to be necessary to inflict new conditions other than these already admitted by the Samaras government.\" But Hollande said he also felt for the Spanish and Portuguese people \"who had paid dear for others' excesses\".</p> <p>\"The time has come to offer a perspective beyond austerity\". He said Spain must know the precise conditions for getting financing agreed in June. There was no reason to make its burden heavier.</p> <p>Asked if the worst was over, Hollande said, \"Yes, the worst \u2013 in the sense of the fear of the eurozone breaking up - is over. But the best isn't there yet. It's up to us to build it.\"</p> <p><em>Interview conducted by Sylvia Kauffmann (Le Monde), Angelique Chrisafis (The Guardian) Berna Gonzalez Harbour (El Pais), Jaroslaw Kurski (Gazeta Wyborcza), Alberto Mattioli (La Stampa) et Stefan Ulrich (S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung)</em></p> <p><em>In keeping with established practice in France, Hollande's quotes were approved prior to publication.</em></p>",
  "<p>If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Apple should be crimson.

People are often too impatient to wait until Apple has approval from Chinese authorities for products to be used on Chinese networks, as well as wanting the lower prices. And Apple has been relatively slow to roll out genuine stores on the mainland.</p> <p>At the same time, the enforcement of rights tends to be spasmodic. \"The intellectual property [situation] is improving, but not as fast as many people would like,\" said Duncan Clark of the BDA China business consultancy, and formerly chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce in China. \"There are periodic crackdowns, but there's still a long way to go.\"</p> <p>Clark suggested that changing demand might be having more of an impact than curbs on the supply of fakes. \"When it comes to very desirable products, Chinese consumers absolutely know the difference and will pay above the odds to get the real thing,\" he said.</p> <p>The surge in fake Apple stores in large part reflects demand for the genuine products. Custer described the iPhone as \"a perfect status symbol that's still in the price range of a lot of people\"; unlike, say, a Mercedes. White-collar buyers want the real deal.</p> <p>But for the others, there are plenty of products \u2013 and not just phones and gadgets \u2013 that appear to be inspired by Apple. At the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/08/chinese-sex-fair-prudishness-liberation earlier\" title=\"Chinese sex fair shows how prudishness and liberation sit side-by-side\">Guangzhou Sex Culture Festival</a> this month, there were \"iPed\" sex toys and, this spring, <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/taniabranigan/7351932618/in/photostream\" title=\"Yes, mango-flavoured iPhone 5 icecreams\">\"iPhone 5\" ice creams</a> \u2013 complete with a trademark symbol \u2013 appeared in convenience stores.</p> <p>Even so, the blogger who first found the Kunming store pointed out that Applemania was not a uniquely Chinese phenomenon. Internet users mailed her images of fake stores from around the world, including one in New York.</p> <p>\"It is more of a global issue, but it doesn't create as nice a story as China ripping off Apple stores,\" she told <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2012/10/17/china-fake-apple-store-blogger-romney-misusing-the-story/\" title=\"Mitt Romney called out on fake Apple store\">the Wall Street Journal</a>.</p> <p>\"[Mitt Romney] uses it as a shorthand to generate outrage about trade practices in China and as a shorthand that he will be quote-unquote 'tough on China'. It's a somewhat meaningless shorthand. I'm not entirely sure he knows what he's referring to at this point.\"</p>",

That 3 October debate was dominated by Romney and started the president's poll slide, leaving the two in a dead heat less than three weeks from election day.</p> <p>Obama will have lifted Democratic morale and may have done enough to slow \u2013 or even arrest \u2013 the crisis.</p> <p>It will be several days before the first reliable polls appear but a snap poll by CNN awarded the debate 46% to Obama and 39% to Romney, while CBS put it as 37% Obama to 30% Romney.</p> <p>Obama, listless in Denver, was transformed in the second debate: focused, animated and combative. The president grew in confidence in the later stages of the night, while Romney, confident at the start, began to fade.</p> <p>Obama's campaign team said Obama turned in the peformance it had expected him to produce two weeks ago.&#xa0;</p> <p>The former White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, reinstated to the Obama team as an adviser, said: \"The president knew he did not do well two weeks ago. &#xa0;He knew he had to step up his game tonight and Mitt Romney was left looking uncomfortable\".</p> <p>Republicans countered that nothing the president said will have changed the dynamic of the race.</p> <p>Romney and Obama now have a presidential debate victory apiece going into the final one, usually the most watched of the three, in Boca Raton, Florida, on Monday.</p> <p>The two men clashed in the second debate \u2013 at Hofstra University, Long Island \u2013 over tax, energy, women's rights, immigration and Libya.&#xa0;</p> <p>Obama taunted Romney over the vagueness of his plans for tax cuts and deficit reduction.&#xa0;\"If somebody came to you, governor, with a plan that said, 'Here, I want to spend seven or eight trillion dollars, and we're going to pay for it, but we can't tell you until maybe after the election how we're going to do it,' you wouldn't have taken such a sketchy deal, and neither should you, the American people,\" Obama said.</p> <p>But the most politically damaging moment for Romney came when he bungled his attack on the Obama administration's handling of the assault on the Benghazi consulate in which the US ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed.&#xa0;</p> <p>It should have been an easy one for Romney, after days of shifting accounts from administration officials who initially blamed the attack on a protest over an Islamophobic film but have now conceded it was a pre-planned terrorist attack.&#xa0;</p> <p>Romney accused Obama of flying off on fund-raising trips the day after the Benghazi killings.&#xa0;</p> <p>But Obama came back forcefully, accepting the buck stopped with him, not with Hillary Clinton or anyone else in his administration. \"Secretary Clinton has done an extraordinary job. But she works for me. I'm the president and I'm always responsible, and that's why nobody's more interested in finding out exactly what happened.\" He described as \"offensive\" Romney seeking to suggest that as president he was acting out of political motivation over the deaths of four Americans.</p> <p>Then, when Romney tried to challenge the president over his assertion that he had described it as an act of terror on the morning after the attack, the moderator Candy Crowley intervened to say that Obama was correct. \"He did, in fact, sir,\" she told Romney, who was unable to counter-attack.</p> <p>Crowley, CNN's chief political correspondent and the first woman in two decades to moderate a presidential debate,&#xa0;went on to point out that it had taken two weeks for the administration to abandon the idea that the attacks were related to protests over the anti-Muslim video. But her intervention left conservatives furious, with one Republican strategist describing it as the most egregious error by a debate moderator ever.</p> <p>Obama also hit home in an exchange over Romney's investments in China. When the Republican responded that Obama should look at the investments in his own pension, Obama, with his trademark grin, shot back: \"I don't look at my pension. It's not as big as yours.\"</p> <p>The power of the quip was that it encapsulated the image the Democrats have been labouring to put across of Romney as rich and elitist, in a different league from the majority of Americans. &#xa0;</p> <p>In the final minutes, to the relief of Democrats, Obama also mentioned the secret video in which Romney dismissed 47% of American voters as freeloaders. The president had dismayed Democrats when he failed to raise it in the Denver debate.</p> <p>The format, a town-hall debate with questions from the audience, makes exchanges between the two awkward and supposedly encourages civil exchanges. From the start Obama and Romney dispensed with tradition, rising from their seats to engage first with the questioners and then one another.</p> <p>During a discussion about lack of drilling for oil on federal land, the two could barely contain themselves, confronting one another just a few feet apart, almost eye-balling one another, with Obama saying \"not true\" while Romney insisted it was \"absolutely true\".</p> <p>Until then it was thought the animosity between the two was confined to policy but it became apparent there is also deep personal antipathy. At one point Romney, almost contemptuous of the president, told him: \"You will get your chance in a minute. I am speaking.\" &#xa0;Republicans may view this as Romney standing up to Obama and what they regard as a representative of the liberal media, but the risk is that independents view it as rudeness.</p> <p>In the early exchanges Romney held his own, at one point witheringly telling Obama that whatever he said he would do in his second term, his first term suggested otherwise.&#xa0;</p> <p>But his difficulties began with a question from an audience member over what the candidates would do to improve conditions for working women. He replied by talking about his time as governor of Massachusetts when he appointed many women into cabinet roles and had commissioned a study on women leaders. But he then delivered an unfortunate line when he said that he had looked through \"whole binders full of women\" when seeking to recruit cabinet members as Massachusetts governor.&#xa0;</p> <p>Romney also clashed repeatedly with Crowley over the rules and how much time he was being given to answer questions.&#xa0;</p> <p>In the spin room afterwards David Axelrod, Obama's campaign adviser, said Romney had been \"cornered and ran out of the room. &#xa0;It was clear to the American people he was exposed tonight.\"</p> <p>Romney's adviser, Ed Gillespie, said: \"The momentum continues for Governor Romney.\" Asked about Romney's failure to control the debate as he had in Denver, he said: \"I don't think it changes the dynamic. This was never about style. It is about substance \u2013 jobs \u2013 and that has not changed.\"</p>",

Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state attempted to deflect growing Republican criticism of the president on the issue ahead of the debate <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/16/obama-accused-benghazi-attack\">by saying the buck stopped with her</a>. </p> <p>But Obama quickly laid the issue to rest when Romney brought it up.<br>\"I am ultimately responsible for what's taking place there,\" he said. \"I'm the one who has to greet those coffins when they come home, so you know I mean what I say.\"</p> <p>Romney was undeterred and sought to pin the president down over why his administration had not immediately called the assault that killed the ambassador, Chris Stevens, and three other Americans a terrorist attack. </p> <p>He accused the administration of hiding behind a false claim that the assault was born out of popular demonstrations against an anti-Muslim video. The president and his officials, Romney said, were either incompetent or involved in a coverup in taking two weeks to acknowledge there had been a terrorist attack. </p> <p>\"It's very clear. This was not a demonstration. This was an attack by terrorists,\" said Romney, clearly believing he had his man. </p> <p>But Obama landed a bombshell. </p> <p>\"The day after the attack, governor, I stood in the rose garden and I told the American people and the world that we were going to find out exactly what happened, that this was an act of terror, and also said that we're going to hunt down those that committed this crime,\" he said.</p> <p>\"You said in the rose garden the day after the attack it was an act of terror?\" Romney asked. \"I want to make sure we get that for the record because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.\"</p> <p>Romney appeared to scent blood and pushed Obama to repeat the claim.<br>The president responded: \"Get the transcript\".</p> <p>At that point the CNN moderator, Candy Crowley, waded in to say that Obama was right, leaving Romney fumbling for a response. The president chimed in with: \"Can you say that a little louder, Candy?\". It drew one of the few bursts of applause during the debate.</p> <p>Romney attempted to rescue the moment.</p> <p>\"It took them a long time to say this was a terrorist act by a terrorist group,\" he said.</p> <p>But the Republican presidential candidate had been made to look ill informed and foolish as his attempt to discredit Obama backfired and the president walked away from a potentially damaging encounter largely unscathed.<br>However, there are likely to be conservatives who will challenge Obama's claim. </p> <p>The transcript of his remarks on September 12 show that he was speaking about the Benghazi attack but also noted that the assault had occurred on the anniversary of al-Qaida's 9/11 on the US. </p> <p>Obama then said: \"No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter that character, or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for. Today we mourn four more Americans who represent the very best of the United States of America.\"</p> <p>Romney's surprise is perhaps understandable because in the days that followed, the administration stuck to the line that the assault was a response to the anti-Muslim video. The White House sent the US ambassador to the UN, Susan Rice, to say that on television talk shows the following weekend. No mention was made of a terrorist attack.</p> <p>Finally, a week after the attack, Matthew Olsen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center, called the killings a terrorist attack but even that was not picked up by most other administration officials. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/29/republicans-obama-chris-stevens-libya\">In the following week</a> the defence secretary, Leon Panetta, and other officials followed. </p> <p>In the debate, Obama strongly defended his administration's integrity in the face of a concerted Republican campaign claiming that senior officials lied about the circumstances of the Benghazi assault. Romney picked up that theme.</p> <p>\"Whether there was some misleading or instead whether we just didn't know what happened, I think you have to ask yourself why didn't we know five days later when the ambassador to the United Nations went on TV to say that this was a demonstration. How could we have not known?\" he said.</p> <p>The president took issue.</p> <p>\"The suggestion that anybody in my team, whether the secretary of state, our UN ambassador, anybody on my team, would play politics or mislead when we lost four of our own, governor, is offensive,\" he said.</p>",

And Mitt Romney had an opportunity to show female voters he cared. But from his bullying of moderator Candy Crowley to his dismissive description of his hiring practices, he fumbled the chance. \"Binders full of women,\" his badly chosen phrase, became the meme of the night and will likely haunt him past Halloween. Here's a deconstruction of what he had to say about women.<br> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>An important topic, and one which I learned a great deal about, particularly as I was serving as governor of my state, because I had the chance to pull together a cabinet and all the applicants seemed to be men.</p> </blockquote> <p>Seemed to be? Implausible from the start, they either were or they weren't.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>And I \u2013 and I went to my staff, and I said, \"How come all the people for these jobs are \u2013 are all men.\" They said: \"Well, these are the people that have the qualifications.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>This is hard to believe. Romney was talking about 2003 \u2013 not 1893. Plenty of women would have been properly qualified.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>And I said: \"Well, gosh, can't we \u2013 can't we find some \u2013 some women that are also qualified?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Patronizing.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>And \u2013 and so we \u2013 we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet. I went to a number of women's groups and said: \"Can you help us find folks,\" and they brought us whole binders full of women.</p> </blockquote> <p>ZING! There was the shot through his foot. \"Binders full of women\" became #bindersfullofwomen on Twitter, a <a href=\"http://bindersfullofwomen.tumblr.com/\">Tumblr page</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/romneybindersfullofwomen\">a Facebook page</a> which within half an hour had over 20,000 likes. By the end of the debate that had risen to almost 70,000. Why did the phrase resonate? Because it was tone deaf, condescending and out of touch with the actual economic issues that women are so bothered about. The phrase objectified and dehumanized women. It played right into the perception that so many women have feared about a Romney administration \u2013 that a president Romney would be sexist and set women back. And it turns out the way Romney presented it \u2013&#xa0;that he asked for a study of women in leadership positions \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/16/obama-romney-second-debate-live#block-507e2fe658f91d7bbadac763\">wasn't true anyway</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I recognized that if you're going to have women in the workforce that sometimes you need to be more flexible. My chief of staff, for instance, had two kids that were still in school. She said: 'I can't be here until 7 or 8 o'clock at night. I need to be able to get home at 5 o'clock so I can be there for making dinner for my kids and being with them when they get home from school.' So we said fine. Let's have a flexible schedule so you can have hours that work for you.</p> </blockquote> <p>Fair enough, flexibility is important. But the picture of a woman having to be home to make dinner for her kids in the 21st Century is a dated one. Was Romney's chief of staff a single parent? Could there have been a partner to share in the dinner-making? His description doesn't sound like it.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We're going to have to have employers in the new economy, in the economy I'm going to bring to play, that are going to be so anxious to get good workers they're going to be anxious to hire women.</p> </blockquote> <p>The inference here is that women only get hired when a numerical need arises. Romney's answer implied women don't get considered on the merits but as a second option.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> I mentioned 3.5 million women, more now in poverty than four years ago.</p> </blockquote> <p>Not allowing women in poverty access to family planning contributes to that number. Romney seemed unaware of the connection between his opposition to an organization like Planned Parenthood and the economic status of many of the women who use it.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What we can do to help young women and women of all ages is to have a strong economy, so strong that employers that are looking to find good employees and bringing them into their workforce and adapting to a flexible work schedule that gives women opportunities that they would otherwise not be able to afford.</p> </blockquote> <p>Again, flexibility is only part of what a woman needs. Romney's answer was confined only to the kind of professional woman qualified to be his chief of staff. There are millions of other working women who still don't get paid at the same rate as men \u2013 despite Obama's Lilly Ledbetter act. Romney never addressed equal pay despite a direct question from the audience about it.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don't believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not. And I don't believe employers should tell someone whether they could have contraceptive care of not. Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives.</p> </blockquote> <p>Presumably so should men. But who should pay for it? Romney's past position has been to allow employers insurance companies to deny coverage for contraceptives on religious or moral grounds.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama had one thing going for him coming into this debate: he couldn't be any worse than the last time. Mitt Romney had one drawback: he apparently couldn't be any better. </p> <p>As it turned out Obama was much better. Clearer, sharper, more decisive and passionate, he challenged Mitt Romney on the facts and rhetorically he overwhelmed him. It was a rout every bit as conclusive as the first debate. Only this time the victor was Obama. Last time he barely showed up; tonight he showed Romney up.</p> <p>Self-assured without being too cocky, focused without being too wonkish, he managed to strike the right balance between being firm with Romney and empathetic with the questioners. There was little of substance that he said that was different; but there was a great deal of difference in the way that he said it.</p> <p>To him were gifted the best lines of the night. When taking on his Republican challenger over his shift from supporting a ban on assault weapons as governor of Massachusetts to opposing them as a presidential candidate, he said: \"He was for an assault weapons ban before he was against it.\" </p> <p>When Romney pushed him on investments in his pension funds, asking if he'd seen his pension recently, Obama responded: \"I don't look at my pension. It's not as big as yours so it doesn't take as long.\" </p> <p>When Romney was corrected by the moderator, Candy Crowley, after suggesting that Obama did not call the attack on the US embassy in Benghazi a \"terrorist attack\" Obama shouted with a smile: \"Say it louder, Candy.\"</p> <p>Romney did put up a fight. Approaching the debate with the same style as he did in Denver he brought his best self. Probably his best line came in an answer about why, given the hard times of Obama's first term, he should be trusted with a second. \"We just can't afford another four years like the last four years,\" said Romney. </p> <p>It is difficult to equate the stiff and impersonal figure of the conventions with the man who showed up tonight. But it simply wasn't enough. Indeed, if anything it was too much. For in his effort to reassert the control he enjoyed during the first debate he overreached. </p> <p>Where he once appeared animated he now came off as aggressive. His interruptions looked desperate and his interjections were shrill. In the two weeks since his triumph in Denver he went from persuasive to petulant.</p> <p>The other loser tonight was US politics. Two men circling, talking over each other, drawing on different facts and calling each other liars looked like a metaphor for much that has gone wrong in American political culture over the last generation. Town hall meetings are supposed to be less confrontational. But more caustic than consensual, this was a bad-tempered affair.</p> <p>Obama's performance will energise his base and shore up the doubts of those shaken by his earlier drubbing. It will staunch the bleeding of support towards Romney but it is unlikely to reverse the flow.</p> <p>They called it a town-hall meeting. But in truth there are very few towns like it. It was a room full of undecided voters: the nation is not.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama and Mitt Romney broke the campaign's long silence on energy policy on Tuesday night in a combative exchange with each claiming to be the stronger supporter of American oil and coal.</p> <p>Environmental campaigners have been pressing debate moderators to include questions on energy and climate change \u2013 hoping to put Obama on the spot to defend his clean energy agenda.</p> <p>Even the oil man T Boone Pickens tweeted a few minutes before the debate that he was anxious for Obama and Romney to have a substantive clash on energy, after the topic was passed over in their first encounter and in the vice-presidential debate.</p> <p>But Obama, while re-affirming clean energy was central to his economic recovery plans, gave his most spirited answer on oil and coal, repeatedly interrupting Romney to tout his support for fossil fuels.</p> <p>Obama pushed back hard at Romney's suggestion that his administration had cut back on offshore oil exploration and oil and gas drilling on public lands \u2013 and repeatedly interrupted the Republican contender when he tried to protest.</p> <p>Obama also took Romney on for accusing the administration of crushing the coal industry. \"Not true, governor Romney,\" the president said repeatedly.</p> <p>\"We've opened up public lands, we're actually drilling more on public lands than the previous president and he was an oil man,\" Obama said. \"When I hear Governor Romney says he's a big coal guy, and governor, keep in mind when you were governor of Massachusetts you stood in front of a coal plant and said: 'This plant kills,' and took pride in shutting it down \u2013 and suddenly you're a champion of coal. So what I've tried to do is be consistent.\"</p> <p>Romney would not let it go, arguing Obama's policies had driven up gas prices. \"The proof of whether a strategy's working or not is what you're paying at the pump. ... but you're paying more [under Obama],\" he said.</p> <p>The Obama camp was on the defensive entering the debate, following news earlier in the day of the bankruptcy filing by A123 a car battery manufacturer that had received $250m in energy department funding.</p> <p>The Romney camp said the bankruptcy was another example of the failure of Obama's energy policy, after the collapse of the solar panel maker Solyndra.</p> <p>Energy is one of the sharpest dividing lines between the two candidates. Obama while professing an \"all-of-the-above\" energy strategy, including expansion of natural gas and offshore oil, has put renewable energy at the heart of his recovery plan.</p> <p>About $90m of the economic stimulus was devoted to green initiatives, including insulation for low-income home owners, public transport and high-speed rail as well as clean energy grants.</p> <p>Obama has disappointed environmental groups by expanding offshore drilling \u2013 including exploration in the pristine Arctic \u2013 and for diluting and delaying regulations to limit the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. He has not vetoed a pipeline carrying tar sands from Alberta, as campaigners demanded.</p> <p>But Obama has continued to talk of renewable energy as part of America's future, including at Tuesday night's debate.</p> <p>Obama has also repeatedly called on Congress to extend tax credits for the wind industry, arguing the support will help save jobs.</p> <p>Romney, in contrast, has set himself up as a support of American energy, promising to approve the controversial Keystone XL pipeline on his first day in the White House.</p> <p>He accuses the Environmental Protection Agency of crushing the coal industry by setting higher standards for new coal-fired power plants.</p> <p>Romney also opposes extending the tax credit for the wind industry.</p>",
