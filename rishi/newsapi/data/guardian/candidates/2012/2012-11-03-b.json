Both measures were eventually blocked by federal courts.&#xa0;</p> <p>Mitchell was also the man behind the removal of convicted felons from the Florida voters' role in 2000 which led to many innocent people with similar names being deprived of the right to vote. A disproportionate number of them were African Americans, who tend to vote for Democrats.&#xa0;The League of Women Voters said that Mitchell's involvement in the most recent legislation is evidence of a \"partisan agenda to manipulate the voting rules\".</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-03T16:20:47.323Z\">at 4.20pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50953cf595cb1506d24447b4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-03T15:49:10.127Z\">3.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Former President Bill Clinton</strong> has just taken the stage at the Obama rally in Chesapeake, Virginia.</p> <p>Clinton will appear with Obama tonight at a major rally in Bristow, Virginia.</p> <p>The crowd likes them some Clinton.

Other polls have the race tighter but with Romney generally holding a two percentage point lead.&#xa0;</p> <p>The Tampa Bay Times / Miami Herald poll confirms anecdotal evidence from voting lines - that a good number of undecideds have been persuaded that Romney will do a better job of fixing the economy even if they are not happy with the Republicans on other issues, such as unemployment. Many voters say that the principal issue for them is jobs in a state hit particularly hard by unemployment and the property crash.</p> <p>Both parties are claiming that early voting trends in Florida give them the upper hand. The Republicans say that Democratic turnout is down on four years ago. Democrats say that they are still ahead in absolute terms.&#xa0;About 3.5 million Floridians have voted early so far - either by post or in person. That's about 30% of the state's electorate and a dramatic increase on 2008 when 2.7 million voted early.</p> <p>About 1.39 million of those are registered Republicans and 1.47 are Democrats.

  "<p>One glance at the list of moderators in the presidential debates told the heads of Univision, the largest Spanish-language television network in the US, that more than 50 million Latinos and their concerns had been ignored, forgotten or, more likely, not even thought about in the first place.</p> <p>So the presenters of the station's influential evening news show, Jorge Ramos and Mar\u00eda Elena Salinas \u2013 icons in the Hispanic community long after news anchors ceased to command the same respect on English-language stations \u2013 issued an on-air call to Barack Obama and Mitt Romney to come to Miami and talk about what matters to the one in 10 voters who speak Spanish.</p> <p>It's a testament to Univision's influence that Obama agreed immediately and Romney was obliged to follow. The ensuing forums \u2013 a mix of audience questions and hard-hitting follow-ups by Ramos and Salinas \u2013 proved a stiffer test for the candidates than any of the debates.</p> <p>Obama was confronted with repeated accusations from the audience and moderators that he broke a promise of comprehensive immigration reform to help the millions of undocumented Latinos in the US. The president was forced into an embarrassing admission that it is the greatest failure of his presidency to date, and that he had been unable to \"change Washington from the inside\".</p> <p>Rightwing talk show hosts, who routinely accuse the mainstream press of giving Obama an easy ride, were delighted he faced a grilling.</p> <p>\"Obama made a promise to our community and he didn't keep it,\" said Isaac Lee, president of Univsion news. \"We could not miss the opportunity to have them there and not ask the questions that need to be asked.\"</p> <p>According to ratings surveys, 72% of Latinos who watch Univision's main evening news broadcast with Ramos and Salinas do not see any other television news. That's unique in the world of cable news, and gives the station unusual influence in the Latino community as well as a different perspective on what its role is.</p> <p>English-language news stations in the US are generally divided by politics \u2013 Fox shouting from the right, MSNBC from the left and CNN floundering for relevance. Lee says Univision eschews a political stand in favour of being a \"voice for the voiceless\" on behalf of the Hispanic community.</p> <p>That means reporting that often drills down into issues largely ignored by English-language media. One recent investigation, into Iranian influence in Latin America, saw <a href=\"http://m.noticias.univision.com/documentales/la-amenaza-irani/article/2011-12-09/la-amenaza-irani?id=786870#axzz2B0PU9ziA\">the Venezuelan consul to Miami deported by the US</a>. Another, into a <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/News/page/univision-news-investigation-operation-fast-furious-weapons-revealed-17352963\">botched federal investigation into gun smuggling</a> that ended up arming Mexican drug cartels, was a severe embarrassment to the Obama administration.</p> <p>Univision election coverage has included tracking down Romney's extended family in Mexico, where the Republican presidential candidate's father was born.</p> <p>\"Romney has a sizeable family in Mexico,\" said Lourdes Torres, head of Univision news election coverage. \"We've been down with them twice already. Nobody else has done that. His family there have a different perspective than him on issues like immigration.\"</p> <p>But the intense focus on issues of interest to the Hispanic community has led to accusations of advocacy journalism, especially when that means politicians are subjected to a level of scrutiny they are not used to from a generally more docile English-language press.</p> <p>Take the flurry of laws in states such as Arizona and Alabama, ostensibly aimed at tracking down undocumented immigrants but which are widely regarded in the Hispanic community as likely to lead to racial profiling, or the recent spate of voter identification legislation, which federal courts have struck down as discriminatory.</p> <p>\"If there's a particular law that's passed, we try to find out who's behind the law, who supports the law,\" said Torres. \"In an electoral context, what are the positions of the candidates on those laws? We would want the viewer to have the right to know the views of the candidates on the issues that are important to them.</p> <p>\"We have a singular role in terms of explaining things to our audience. Sometimes that is interpreted as advocacy because there is more depth. We may point out certain figures or politicians who are supporting or not supporting certain things that do affect the community. Some people may call that advocacy.\"</p> <p>Lee is dismissive of what he describes as the easy way out of \"telling two sides of the story\", so common in US journalism, in which opposing points of view are presented with little insight into who is telling the truth \u2013 because American reporters are so afraid of being accused of bias. Lee paraphrases Elie Wiesel, the Holocaust survivor and writer, as saying neutrality hurts the weak. </p> <p>\"I think it's true that we cannot let go of our responsibility to represent Hispanic people in this country,\" he said. \"There is a very close relationship between Univision and its viewers. They feel Univision is there representing them. It's defending them. This is a disenfranchised community that relies on Univision for a lot of things. I've been very shocked learning from our local stations that people call to ask which doctor to take their kids to, which schools they should go to.\"</p> <p>Univision got into what Lee describes as an \"interesting conversation\" with the New York Times about its use of the word \"illegal\" to described undocumented immigrants. Lee contends that it is dehumanising.</p> <p>\"A person is not illegal. He can do something that is illegal or not. But you are not 'an illegal'. We're very careful about that and we think the Hispanic community here is going through one of those important stages in US history where it's a human rights issue. The same way that people used to use the word homo or nigger and it was acceptable at that time, the word illegal is going to be looked back on with a different perspective,\" he said.</p> <p>The New York Times did not back down, but there was a time when the paper would probably not have felt the need to respond at all.</p> <p>Univision is marking 50th year with plans for a joint venture with ABC for an English-language version of its reporting and is already putting up its content in English on the ABC site. But Torres, who has been with the station since the 1980s, remembers that it was often ignored by politicians.</p> <p>\"You would call and they would say: you are who? You are what?\" she said. \"Now you don't have to explain who we are and what we represent. But I wouldn't say they come running to us.\"</p> <p>What hasn't changed much is that the Hispanic community is frequently viewed as a monolithic block by much of the rest of America. But the complexities of the Latino diaspora in the US present its own problems putting together a news programme for Spanish speakers.</p> <p>The bulk, spread across border states from California to Texas and beyond, are either Mexican-born or of Mexican descent. But there is a sizeable Puerto Rican population dispersed between the island, New York and Florida. Florida is also home to more than one million Cuban Americans, a substantial number of Dominicans and a growing Central American population. </p> <p>\"That's a challenge this network has,\" said Torres. \"To be a Mexican is not Central American, not Guatemalan, not Cuban. There's a language that unifies us but not necessarily one culture that unifies us. I think what does unify us are issues. That we are viewed as a monolithic block also unifies us.\"</p> <p>There are also issues that divide. Torres acknowledged that there was a time when the station had to tread carefully on its coverage of Fidel Castro and Cuba under scrutiny from vocal and sometimes powerful hard line anti-communists in the Cuban American community. But Castro was not viewed with nearly so much hostility by immigrants from some other countries in the region who saw him as championing the poor and standing up to US domination. </p> <p>That, too, has changed. \"The community changed so much. It's not as political among younger generations,\" she said.</p> <p>It's that younger generation that Univision has its eye on. The average age of views of its news programmes are already 10 years younger than English-language cable news. There are about 500,000 Latinos turning 18 every year for the next 10 years in the US. But most of those are bilingual, hence the move into English-language television with a focus on the Hispanic community.</p> <p>\"We need to cater to those who want to hear what we have to say in English,\" said Lee. \"It also helps us get noticed. One of the things that helped us to start being taken seriously by the rest of the media was we started doing things in English, on the web. It's been a major change.\"</p>",
  "<p>The US justice department is scrutinising the conduct of early voting in Florida after people waited for hours in some places to cast a ballot and the state governor, Rick Scott, refused to extend voting beyond Saturday.</p> <p>The justice department said it is monitoring some polling stations to ensure compliance with the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which bars states from placing obstacles in the way of balloting after the Florida legislature cut the number of early voting days in a move Democrats said disadvantaged Barack Obama's supporters. Elections in Florida have attracted particular scrutiny since the 2000 debacle which delivered George Bush into power.</p> <p>As hours-long lines once again formed in some parts of the state for the final day of early voting on Saturday, opinion polls were at odds on how the crucial swing state will decide. <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/content/tampa-bay-times-fla-poll-romney-51-obama-45\">A Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald poll</a> put Mitt Romney six percentage points ahead, 51% to 45%. But an NBC/Wall Street Journal survey gave a small advantage to Barack Obama.</p> <p>The contradictory polls reflected the uncertainty of a heated competition in the state that has seen early voting rise dramatically compared to four years ago and supporters of both candidates saying they voted to keep the other out.</p> <p>But the Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald survey also confirmed that many swing voters, particularly Hispanics, have been drawn to Romney by economic desperation and a belief that he will be better able to create jobs.</p> <p>About 3.5 million Floridians had voted early by Friday \u2013 either by post or in person. That's about 30% of the state's electorate and a dramatic increase on 2008 when 2.7 million voted early.</p> <p>About 1.39 million of the early voters are registered Republicans and 1.47 million are Democrats. However, that doesn't necessarily reflect how they voted. Both parties gave differing interpretations of the the figures \u2013 totals of postal voting and people who turned out early in person \u2013 to claim the advantage. What the turnout and long lines at polling stations did clearly show is how strongly some people feel about this election. </p> <p>Michelle Butler, a business manager and Obama supporter, said she was driven to the polls not by the excitement she felt in 2008 but a sense that he has been unfairly treated by Romney and the Republicans. </p> <p>\"I think people are frustrated that the Republicans are blaming Obama even though he's completely turned the economy around,\" she said. \"The Republicans said they would make him a one-term president as soon as he came to power. We saw what happened. They blocked him in Congress instead of putting the country first. People are upset that the Republicans don't play fair.\"</p> <p>Erin O'Brian, a teacher, said she doesn't trust Romney.</p> <p>\"It's all of his flip-flopping. I think people are frustrated. They don't really know who Romney is or what he would do as president. That makes you wonder who would be influencing him. I think people are afraid,\" she said. \"I used to cry listening to Obama speak. But that's not what it's about this time. This is about my daughter's future.\"</p> <p>But many Republicans are excited at the albeit diminishing prospect of removing Obama from power.</p> <p>\"Romney wouldn't be my first choice for president,\" said a petrol station owner, Frank Held, at a Tampa polling station. \"But he's not Obama. That's all that matters now. Three more days and Obama's out. We've waited four years to put right the historic, horrible mistake this country made in electing him.\"</p> <p>As the race enters its final days, both campaigns have saturated key areas of the state with adverts including one from Mitt Romney that says Fidel Castro, Che Guevara and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the left-leaning Venezuelan president, would vote for Obama. The advert includes a sound bite in which Chavez says: \"If I were American, I'd vote for Obama\" and \"If Obama were from [Venezuela], he'd vote for Ch\u00e1vez.\"</p> <p>Castro's niece, Mariela Castro, is seen on video saying: \"I would vote for President Obama.\" She is the daughter of Cuba's present leader, Raul Castro, and a campaigner for gay rights.</p> <p>Florida voters have faced long lines all week to vote early, with some people queuing for five hours, in part because the ballot runs to several pages, with proposed constitutional amendments as well as electing a president, members of Congress and local officials, and it takes a while to fill it out even if people are fully prepared. </p> <p>But Democrats say another reason for the extended lines is that the Republican legislature cut the number of early voting days from 14 to eight to discourage Democrats, who are more likely to vote early, from going to the polling stations. One particularly blatant move was to scrap voting on the last Sunday before election day when many African Americans in Florida traditionally go to the polls after church.</p> <p>But there have been other measures to discourage early voting, or voting at all, some of which have been struck down by the federal courts as blatant discrimination. </p> <p>The League of Women Voters says that the man behind this is the same Republican party official who effectively rigged the 2000 vote in Florida which delivered George Bush into power by a few hundred voters. </p> <p>The league alleges in a lawsuit that the Republican party of Florida's legal counsel, Emmett \"Bucky'' Mitchell IV, wrote the first draft of legislation making it considerably more difficult for groups such as the League of Women Voters to conduct voter registration campaigns and requiring photo identification for voters on the grounds of concern about fraudulent balloting \u2013 a virtually non-existent problem. Both measures were eventually blocked by federal courts. </p> <p>Mitchell was also the man behind the removal of convicted felons from the Florida voters' role in 2000 which led to many innocent people with similar names being deprived of the right to vote. A disproportionate number of them were African Americans, who tend to vote for Democrats. </p> <p>The League of Women Voters said that Mitchell's involvement in the most recent legislation is evidence of a \"partisan agenda to manipulate the voting rules\".</p>",
  "<p>When Barack Obama and Mitt Romney hit the trail, what do they usually tell their crowds? What lines do they bust out at every campaign stop \u2013 often just swapping out the name of one state for another? Chances are you've never been to a rally, but we can tell you.</p> <p>We studied transcripts and videos of more than two dozen speeches by the candidates since the last week of September, and we've identified their most oft-repeated phrases and promises. While we could have, we didn't count the frequent minor jabs, but focused on the more monumental statements that wound their way into every speech. </p> <p>If you showed up at one of the candidates' recent campaign stops, here's what you have expected to hear \u2013 often verbatim.</p> <p></p> <h2>Obama's greatest hits from the trail</h2> <p></p> <p>Despite having taken time off from campaigning this week to deal with his actual <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/30/obama-sandy-aftermath-campaign\">presidential duties after superstorm Sandy</a>, here's what president Obama has been telling his rally-goers over the past month. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\" id=\"blue\"> <p>I will say it again \u2013 the path I'm offering is not quick or easy. But it leads to a better place.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\" id=\"blue\"> <p>I want to end tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas, give them to companies that are investing and creating jobs right here in the United States of America.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\" id=\"blue\"> <p>I want to cut our oil imports in half by 2020 so we control more of our own energy.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\" id=\"blue\"> <p>The last thing we can afford, [insert battleground state name], right now is four years of the very same policies that led us into the mess in the first place.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\" id=\"blue\"> <p>I also want to make sure that our kids and our workers are better trained than everybody else. We've got to make this a national mission. I want to recruit 100,000 math and science teachers to make sure our kids are at the cutting edge. I want to train 2 million workers at community colleges so they have the skills for the jobs that are there right now and the jobs of the future. I want to work to make sure that colleges and universities keep tuition down so our young people aren't burdened with debt.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\" id=\"blue\"> <p>[Insert battleground state name], we cannot grow this economy from the top down. This economy grows from the middle out, when everybody has ladders of opportunity; if they work hard they can succeed, they can get ahead. That's how we move ahead.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\" id=\"blue\"> <p>I want to reduce our deficit by $4tn, but I want to do it in a balanced way. We'll cut out spending we don't need, but I'm going to ask the wealthiest Americans to pay a little bit more so we can invest in the research and technology and infrastructure that keeps new jobs and businesses coming to America. </p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\" id=\"blue\"> <p>I will never, under the guise of reducing the deficit, turn Medicare into a voucher </p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\" id=\"blue\"> <p>I'll use the savings from ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to put people back to work doing some nation-building here at home rebuilding our roads and our bridges, our broadband lines in the rural areas, fixing our schools up. When our veterans come home, I want to make sure they've got jobs waiting for them.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\" id=\"blue\"> <p>Governor Romney \u2026 he's counting on you forgetting that his policies aren't going to work. He's hoping that you won't remember and you'll come down with a case of what we call 'Romnesia'.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\" id=\"blue\"> <p>I don't think any male politician should be making healthcare decisions for women. I don't think your boss or your insurance company should be making those decisions for you either. I believe women are capable and should make their own healthcare decisions for themselves. </p> </blockquote> <h2>Romney's greatest hits from the trail</h2> <p>Mitt Romney has been touting his \"five-point plan\" for the long haul, but over the last few weeks he has doubled-down, referring to his five steps to economic recovery at every rally opportunity. From taking advantage of all of America's natural resources \u2013 <em>all of them</em> \u2013 to giving a leg up to small businesses, here are his top lines while on the campaign trail. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We're going to take advantage of our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We're going to open up new markets for trade \u2026 I will open up trade particularly in Latin America to get more good jobs in this country. And by the way, I'm going to crack down on China when they cheat \u2013 they can't steal our jobs with unfair practices.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When it comes to jobs and the economy the president's agenda is more of the same. \u2026 He calls it going forward, I call it 'forewarned'.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I will not raise taxes on middle class Americans and I will not raise taxes on small business.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If I get elected president, we're going to repeal Obamacare and put in place real reforms that help reel in the cost of healthcare.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We're going to champion small business. \u2026 I'm going to help small businesses with lower taxes, regulations that help small business, and of course we're going to help small business by repealing Obamacare \u2013 it kills jobs. </p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I'm going to meet regularly with Democrats and Republicans to work together to solve our problems.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We're going to make sure our people have the skills they need to succeed. There are 47 different federal government training programs, reporting to eight different government agencies. Think of all the waste and the bureaucracy. I want to take that money and give the fair share of it to [insert battleground state name].</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We're going to cut federal spending \u2013 we're going to cap federal spending and finally get us on track to a balanced budget. </p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I will make sure it's time to put our kids and our parents and the teachers first, and the teachers' union behind.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I will not cut our military \u2013 we will keep our military second to none.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It's time for a big change.

  "<p>It was like a coronation. Mitt Romney came to the Republican heartland of Ohio on Friday night attended by the high priests of the conservative movement.</p> <p>The Republican challenger brought with him onto the stage in a frosty fairgrounds outside this south-west Ohio town not just his wife Ann, his running mate Paul Ryan and his wife Janna, but a veritable conservative hall of fame. </p> <p>There was Romney's predecessor as presidential candidate, John McCain, and his wife Cindy; a cornucopia of US senators and governors including Rob Portman of Ohio, Marco Rubio of Florida, Bobby Jindal of Louisiana; and the two Ricks who had given Romney such a hard time in the Republican primaries: Rick Perry and Rick Santorum, though they were pointedly not invited to speak.</p> <p>And still they kept on coming, standing frozen in a long line on the stage to display their unquestioning loyalty to their anointed leader. Rudy Giuliani, still adored after all these years as the \"zero tolerance\" saviour of New York, denounced Barack Obama as \"the worst president for our economy in our lifetime\".</p> <p>Then John Boehner, speaker of the House of Representatives, appeared. His eyes were watering from the bitterly cold wind, unless he was crying which is eminently possible.</p> <p>Boehner was given a particularly lusty cheer by the crowd, as West Chester is his home town and south-west Ohio his childhood manor. \"Four years ago Barack Obama talked about hope and change and post-partisan politics,\" this most partisan of congressional leaders said. \"But four years later we have got less jobs and less freedom.\"</p> <p>If this mega rally, which the organisers inexplicably billed as a \"Romney-Ryan Real Recovery Road Rally\", was designed to show the world that the Republican nominee finally has the back of his own party, it was left terribly late in the day. With less than three days left of campaigning, we are well beyond the eleventh hour.</p> <p>But the crowd lapped it up, chanting \"Four more days\" as a taunting riposte to the Democrats' \"four more years\", and waving placards that said: \"Moms for Mitt\", \"We are Romulans\" and \"Redlegs for Romney\".</p> <p>It remains the case though, despite the high-powered turn-out for Romney, that conservative voters are more energised this year by hatred of Obama than they are by any love of their own candidate. When asked what had inspired them to come out on this frigid night, individuals in the almost exclusively white crowd invariably talked about their fears about the future of their country under its current leadership.</p> <p>\"Four more years of Obama and the mood of the country will deteriorate; we'll slide into a non-work ethic,\" said heavy-equipment operator Mike Roberts.</p> <p>\"We are heading towards European socialism, like Greece and Spain,\" said Ed Lewis. \"We will be owned by somebody else, we'll never see the prosperity our parents saw,\" said his wife Jo.</p> <p>Those are the anxieties, the paranoias, that the Republican high command, shivering on stage, hope will drive sufficient Ohioans to the polling stations on Tuesday to paint this state, and thus the presidency, red. When Romney finally joined them and took the microphone, the 18th speaker of the night, he picked up the theme.</p>",
  "<p>When Barack Obama was contemplating a run for the White House his wife, Michelle, asked him what he thought he could accomplish if he won. \"The day I take the oath of office,\" he replied. \"The world will look at us differently. And millions of kids across this country will look at themselves differently. That alone is something.\"</p> <p>Four months after he was sworn in, at least one kid saw himself differently. It was May 2009 and 5-year-old Jacob Philadelphia had gone with his dad, a black ex-marine, to the Oval Office for a family photograph with the president. </p> <p>With him were his mum, Roseanne, and his older brother, Isaac, 8. The boys were allowed to ask Obama one question each. The parents had no idea what they were going to say. Isaac asked why the president had got rid of the F-22 jet fighter. The president said because it cost too much. Jacob asked:</p> <p>\"I want to know if my hair is just like yours.\"</p> <p>He was so quiet, Obama asked him to repeat the question. Jacob obliged.</p> <p>Obama said: \"Why don't you touch it and see for yourself?\"</p> <p>He bent down lowered his head so that it was within Jacob's reach.</p> <p>Jacob paused. The president prompted. \"Touch it, dude!\" he said</p> <p>Jacob reached out and rubbed the presidential pate.</p> <p>\"So, what do you think?\" Mr Obama asked.</p> <p>\"Yes, it does feel the same,\" Jacob said.</p> <p>The White House photographer <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/24/us/politics/indelible-image-of-a-boys-pat-on-obamas-head-hangs-in-white-house.html\">snapped the moment</a>. \"Every couple of weeks the White House photographers change out the photos in the West Wing,\" Michelle Obama <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/the-obama-haircut/2012/10/25/efc1d556-1ea2-11e2-9746-908f727990d8_video.html\">said at a fundraiser in September</a>. \"Except for that one. So if you ever wonder whether change is possible, I want you think of that little black boy in the Oval Office of the White House touching the head of the first black president.\"</p> <p>The symbolic resonance of Obama's victory for black Americans has not diminished. At rallies the hawkers are still there with T-shirts setting him alongside Martin Luther King, setting his logo within Superman's crest or insisting: \"I like my coffee black. Like my president\". According to Gallup 90% of African Americans intend to back him and they plan to turn out at the same rate as white voters. No other block of voters is more loyal.</p> <p>No other block of voters is <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/behind-the-numbers/2011/02/race_and_recession_poll_aa_opt.html\">more optimistic</a>. Over the past few years polls have <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/19/AR2011021903265.html\">consistently shown</a> that African Americans are more likely than any other group to be bullish about their own future, to think the country's best days are yet to come and that the economy is already recovering.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2010/01/12/blacks-upbeat-about-black-progress-prospects/\">Pew survey</a> in January 2010 indicated that the percentage of black Americans who thought blacks were better off than they were five years before had almost doubled since 2007. There were also significant increases in the percentages who believed the standard-of-living gap between whites and blacks was decreasing. No wonder they love the president.</p> <p>There was only one trouble with these assessments. They weren't true. African Americans, as a group, are far worse off now than they were when Obama came to power and the gap between whites and blacks in terms of wealth and income has increased under Obama's tenure. The overall rate of unemployment may be close to where it was when Obama took office, but black unemployment is up 11%. Meanwhile <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2012/06/21/news/economy/wealth-gap-race/index.htm?iid=EL\">the wealth gap has doubled</a> during this recession with the average white American now having 22 times more wealth than their black counterparts. So too has the educational achievement gap with the rate at which white Americans graduate from high school growing at a far faster clip than black students.</p> <p>\"We haven't seen much of the stimulus trickle down to our people here,\" Mark Allen, a Chicago-based community organiser who used to work alongside Obama, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/for-obama-acquaintance-change-was-not-enough/2012/08/16/92deaf86-e7d8-11e1-a3d2-2a05679928ef_gallery.html\">told the Washington Post</a>. \"I liked the community organiser Obama better than President Obama \u2026 Democrats say Barack has got 90% or whatever of the black vote wrapped up. What they don't tell you is it's 90% of those who actually come out and vote. What if it's 90% of just 30 or 40% who vote?\"</p> <p>In short, Jacob's odds of getting a decent job when he gets older actually got worse since he felt the president's hair, while the gap between his life chances and his white schoolmates widened and his odds of going to prison remained pretty much the same. In empirical terms \"the change that [has been] possible\" for Jacob and his family under Obama has been change for the worse. One can argue about the cause of those changes and the degree to which Obama bears any responsibility for either creating them or fixing them. But one cannot argue about the fact of them: the ascent of America's first black president has coincided with the one of the steepest descents of the economic fortunes of black Americans since the second world war both in real terms and relative to whites.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398880173\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/07/10/0710_jesse_460x276.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama and Jesse Jackson\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Then-senator Barack Obama with Reverend Jesse Jackson in 2007.

The group that has fared worse under Obama is not only the group most likely to support him but also the most likely to feel optimistic about the deteriorating situation in which they find themselves. And why has that loyalty to the president yet to be fully tested? What do they know that the numbers don't show?</p> <p>Discussing this dilemma within the black community can be tantamount to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/oct/02/younge-america-obama-black-vote-video\">heresy</a>. Wagons circle, messengers are shot, ranks close, critical faculties are suspended. \"Too many black intellectuals have given up the hard work of thinking carefully in public about the crisis facing black America,\" Princeton professor Eddie Glaude <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/opinion/sunday/the-price-of-a-black-president.html?ref=todayspaper&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">told fellow academic Fred Harris recently</a>. \"We have either become cheerleaders for President Obama or self-serving pundits.\" Not only are criticisms shunned but even constructive critiques are unwelcome. At times it seems like questions as to how his tenure has affected black communities either should not be asked or, at the very least, should not be answered honestly. </p> <p>\"I have friends,\" says Virginia state delegate, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/oct/02/younge-america-obama-black-vote-video\">Onzlee Ware</a> from Roanoke, who is an ardent Obama supporter, \"who, if I bring [his shortcomings] up as an intellectual conversation, they say I'm a traitor.\"</p> <p>There are some sound reasons for this. The first is the overt racism that Obama has faced from a significant portion both of the political class and the public as a whole. There are plenty of reasons why one might oppose Obama that have nothing to do with race. When you look at how the things they accused the Clintons of \u2013 killing people, smuggling drugs from abroad, embezzling \u2013 the Obama's are not unique in being the targets of a right wing hyper-caffeinated lie machine.</p> <p>Nonetheless, the nature of these particular lies and attacks have, as often as not, been <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/165576/gops-blatant-racism \">rooted in race</a>. Half of white Americans in one Pew survey shared the birthers' doubt that Obama was born in this country. The percentage of Americans who believed he is a Muslim has doubled since he took office. After the president produced his long-form birth certificate, Donald Trump demanded his college transcripts (claiming he was not smart enough to get into an Ivy League school). Newt Gingrich branded him the \"food stamp president\". Southern congressmen shout \"liar\" while he's speaking, Romney surrogates question his connection to \"Anglo-Saxon values\". </p> <p>Far from his election signalling a post-racial era of equality it has exposed and unleashed a visceral level of intolerance that has produced the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/poll-shows-widening-racial-gap-in-presidential-contest/2012/10/25/9d5be0d4-1ed1-11e2-9cd5-b55c38388962_story.html\">most racially polarised</a> electorate for at least a generation. Having alienated blacks and Latinos, a recent poll revealed that Romney's support is 91% white \u2013 that's a higher proportion than any candidate since Bush's father stood in 1988 and may yet surpass it.</p> <p>Meanwhile a recent <a href=\"http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/10/27/14740413-ap-poll-majority-harbor-prejudice-against-blacks?lite\">AP poll</a> revealed that, if anything, racist attitudes have hardened in the country since Obama's election. The poll showed that \"51% of Americans now express explicit anti-black attitudes, compared with 48% in a similar 2008 survey\". The proportion who express anti-Hispanic feelings is roughly the same. That's within the margin of error. But what's clear is that it's not going down. Anyone who seriously believes Obama's election ushered in a new period of racial harmony simply hasn't been paying attention.</p> <p>In this atmosphere many African Americans become understandably defensive. Under such sustained racial onslaught the space for free-wheeling conversation and constructive criticism becomes limited because the issue has shifted from what Obama has done to who he is. Given the nature of the attacks the need to defend Obama's right to be in office at all eclipses any more nuanced conversation about his actual record.</p> <p>Moreover much of the criticism Obama has faced from the black community has been either ridiculous or self-defeating. Last year former Princeton professor Cornel West <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/blog/88521/cornell-west-uncovers-the-disturbing-truth#\">led a well-publicised assault</a> insisting that Obama has \"a certain fear of free black men\". </p> <p>\"It's understandable,\" he said. \"As a young brother who grows up in a white context, brilliant African father, he's always had to fear being a white man with black skin. All he has known culturally is white. He is just as human as I am, but that is his cultural formation. When he meets an independent black brother, it is frightening ... He has a certain rootlessness, a deracination. It is understandable.\"</p> <p>Essentialising Obama's racial and cultural makeup in such a way makes the very mistake that the right makes \u2013 assessing Obama not on what he does but by who he is.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398880174\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/13/1347526519965/b2c9ac06-290a-45e7-8390-16afcdacadae-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Mona Renee Johnson weeps as President Barack Obama speaks at a campaign rally last night in Las Vegas, Nevada.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mona Renee Johnson weeps as Obama speaks at a campaign rally in Las Vegas, Nevada.  Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: KEVIN LAMARQUE/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It also harps back to an era of black political leadership, where black politicians emerged from the church or historically black colleges, and fought not to win office outside the black community (white people wouldn't vote for them) but to put the needs of that community on the agenda. There was, in a previous generation, a sense of ownership that black communities had over their politicians that no longer exists. This is partly progress. Ivy League universities will admit them, corporations will hire them, funds will come to them, white people will now vote for them. A whole range of opportunities are open to politicians of Obama's generation that were created by Cornel West's generation.</p> <p>But that, in turn, has changed what it means to be a black politician and what, if anything, we mean when <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/obama-effect\">we talk about black politics</a>. Unlike, say, Jesse Jackson or Martin Luther King, Obama was not politically produced by the black community, but presented to it after he had made his way through the mostly white elites. His political ties to the black community are not organic but symbolic. His arrival in the political class is hailed as the progress of a community when in fact it is the advancement of an individual. </p> <p>\"[Obama] is being consumed as the embodiment of color blindness,\" Angela Davis, professor of history of consciousness at the University of California, Santa Cruz, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/nov/08/usa.gender\">told me in late 2007</a>. \"It's the notion that we have moved beyond racism by not taking race into account. That's what makes him conceivable as a presidential candidate. He's become the model of diversity in this period \u2026 a model of diversity as the difference that makes no difference. The change that brings no change.\"</p> <p>That is why criticisms of him for \"not doing enough for his own people\" both miss and devalue the point. The demand to close the racial gaps bequeathed by centuries of discrimination is not a sectional interest but a national one. Demands for equality and racial justice should be made to any president of whatever race or party. </p> <p>Obama should do more for black people \u2013 not because he is black but because black people are the citizens suffering most. Black people have every right to make demands on Obama \u2013 not because they're black but because they gave him a greater percentage of their votes than any other group, and he owes his presidency to them. Like any president, he should be constantly pressured to put the issue of racial injustice front and centre and if black people aren't going to apply that pressure then nobody else will.</p> <p>But in fact precisely the opposite has been happening. With Obama in the White House African Americans representatives have been backpedalling. Black politicians, too, have held their fire. </p> <p>\"With 14% unemployment, if we had a white president we'd be marching around the White House,\" said the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC), Emmanuel Cleaver. \"The president knows we are going to act in deference to him in a way we wouldn't to someone white.\" That's pathetic and counterproductive. These are the very people who are now showing up with empty hands and trying to galvanise the black community to go to the polls.</p> <p>Their reticence is partly explained by the fear of a backlash. \"If we go after the president too hard, you're going after us,\" Maxine Waters, a California Democrat in the House, told a largely black audience in Detroit last year. But then that's what leadership is about. Explaining to those audiences that there are large numbers of people lobbying for Obama's attention, including people with huge amounts of money and power. If the black community wants it they must demand it.</p> <p>Some have spoken out. In August after a month-long round of job fairs organised by the CBC across the nation John Conyers, the longest serving black American in Congress <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21563718\">said</a>. \"We want [Obama] to know from this day forward that we've had it. We want him to come out on our side and advocate, and not to watch and wait \u2026 We're suffering.\" Unfortunately it was followed by little in the way of action.</p> <p>In the absence of that pressure Obama has felt little need to focus his attention on the problem, even rhetorically. In his first two years in office he talked about race less than any Democratic president since 1961. In all of his state of the union speeches he mentioned poverty just three times: last year's was the first since 1948 to not mention poverty or the poor at all. When he did talk about it it was to preach <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/jul/19/us-race-obama-speech\">better parenting, healthy meals and greater discipline</a>.</p> <p>At a Congressional Black Caucus meeting in September he <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/michelle-singletary-obamas-unfortunate-remarks-on-peoples-misfortunes/2011/09/27/gIQAXpau2K_story.html\">told his former colleagues</a>: \"Take off your bedroom slippers, put on your marching shoes. Shake it off. Stop complaining, stop grumbling, stop crying.\" Compare that to the meeting he had with bankers not long after he was elected when they thought he was going to impose serious regulation. \"I'm the only thing standing between you and the pitchforks. I'm not out there to go after you,\" he told them. \"I'm protecting you.\"</p> <p>This would not be the first time that the black Americans have shown great loyalty to a Democratic president who did not return the favour. Bill Clinton is still revered even though when he ran in 1992 he made a special trip back to Arkansas to oversee the <a href=\"http://www.talkleft.com/story/2008/1/24/105451/284 \">execution</a> of Ricky Ray Rector \u2013 a black, lobotomised inmate so mentally incapacitated that when given his last meal, he opted to save the dessert for after the execution. When in power he signed off on a welfare reform that would prove devastating to large numbers of black families, especially women. He presided over an economic boom. Obama does not even have that.</p> <p>It may be in this mixture of realism and low expectations that one can understand the logic of optimism in harder times. That black Americans are doing worse than everyone else, and that the man they elected to turn that around has not done so, does not fundamentally change their view of how American politics works; almost every other Democratic president has failed in a similar way while Republicans have not even tried to succeed. </p> <p>Conversely the fact that a black man might be elected president, that enough white people might vote for him and that nobody has shot him, really has changed their assumptions about what is possible. Jacob's story from the Oval Office is new and inspiring; the story of his odds of success beyond that moment are wearily familiar.</p> <p>The day Obama took office, the world may have looked at black America differently, but black America has yet to look at Obama differently. When he went from being an aspiration to a fact of political life, the posters that bore his likeness in socialist realist style over single-word commands like Hope, Believe and Change should have been replaced with posters bearing the single-word statement: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/jan/19/obama-inauguration\">power</a>. As Frederick Douglass said: \"Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.\"</p>",
  "<p>With the election only days away, it is a fair question to ask how many American voters are about to cast their votes for a candidate who doesn't really reflect their views? Why would they do that?</p> <p>The answer is complex \u2013 and simple. The Republicans and Democrats have spent decades trading power back and forth between themselves, and in doing so, have managed to install a two-party duopoly that completely controls America's political process. This duopoly runs everything from how candidates qualify to get on the ballot, to who is invited to the only debates aired on national television, to, yes, the special-interest money that fuels their <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2012/10/2012-election-spending-will-reach-6.html\">billion-dollar campaigns</a>.</p> <p>The consequences of this insider game? Too many voters approach Tuesday's election believing their choice is between a Republican and a Democrat, with no other real option. And why shouldn't they? The debates they have seen only included the Republican and the Democrat. The hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of TV ads they have seen are all about the Republican and the Democrat. And the news media? Well, they have bought into the whole scheme, with coverage that overwhelmingly portrays a two-party race.</p> <p>There's a problem, though. This duopoly leaves tens of millions of Americans essentially disenfranchised. Polling shows that <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2012/08/23/a-closer-look-at-the-parties-in-2012/\">roughly one third of voters</a> doesn't necessarily consider themselves Democrats <em>or</em> Republicans. Every election, they end up making a choice between what some would call the \"lesser of two evils\".</p> <p>Where is it written that voters' choices should be so limited? Certainly not in the US constitution. Certainly not in the law. And certainly not because the voters themselves decided that the media, two massively well-funded political parties or anyone else should \"preselect\" their choices for them.</p> <p>In Tuesday's election, the sizable portion of the American electorate that believes the time is past when our troops should have been brought home from Afghanistan doesn't have a \"major-party\" candidate who agrees with them. The millions who believe government is far too large and intrusive will be looking at major-party options that <a href=\"http://communities.washingtontimes.com/neighborhood/reawakening-liberty/2012/nov/2/support-kill-list-and-ndaa-make-obama-and-romney-u\">both support</a> the Patriot Act and a National Defense Authorization Act, which inexplicably legalizes the indefinite detention of American citizens. And for those who care deeply about marriage equality, they won't see a major-party candidate who believes marriage discrimination violates basic constitutional rights.</p> <p>On the most compelling issue of all in these difficult times, the economy, what do the two major parties offer? Vague assurances that they will balance the budget someday, years or even <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2012/09/24/news/economy/romney-balanced-budget/index.html\">decades from now</a>, quibbling over minor adjustments to a fundamentally flawed and corrupt tax system. And neither offers any real commitment to challenge monetary policies that are devaluing our currency by the day.</p> <p>Where is the choice on election day for a candidate who will balance the budget <em>now</em> and propose the first substantial reform of the entire tax code in decades \u2013 scrapping taxes on income and replacing them with a single consumption tax that will create millions of jobs?</p> <p>Giving the American people these choices is what my campaign for president is all about. Of our $16tn debt, almost equal amounts have been racked up under Republicans and Democrats. Our chronic involvement in costly and unnecessary wars has come through a progression of major-party administrations that seem to have little or no disagreements on foreign policy. Likewise, the truly alarming erosion of our civil liberties by the federal government has been an entirely bipartisan effort. </p> <p>Americans deserve the opportunity to vote for a third choice: a candidate who is neither a product <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/06/legalising-marijuana-gary-johnson\">nor a proponent of a status quo</a> that is clearly not working. My candidacy, the thousands of volunteer hours spent overcoming obstacles to ballot access, and the determination of our campaign to \"crash the party\" are all driven by the desire and, I believe, <em>the imperative</em> to break the two-party stranglehold.</p> <p>It will not happen in one election. But like all significant movements in American history, it can start with one election if the disenfranchised \"waste their votes\" in significant enough numbers to become franchised again.</p>",

  "<p>When I went to vote last week in New York City, using an absentee ballot (because I will be out of the country on election day), I had a surreal experience that was also very ordinary: I marked my ballot \u2013 put it, as advised by the nice man behind the counter, into a sealed envelope, handed it to him and \u2026 nothing.</p> <p>That is, he looked at me quizzically as I waited. For what? I realized that in every transaction I ever had with the government, I get some kind of receipt or documentation. But I had just handed over my most precious possession, my vote, and I had nothing to show for it. No scrap of paper noting for the record what I had done, and no way to verify that what I wished to do got recorded accurately.</p> <p>The fellow offered, when I expressed some wish for something like this, to use my phone camera to take a picture of me holding the sealed envelope \u2013 for proof I had voted. Seriously.</p> <p>We treat the black hole where our votes vanish as if we don't dare to validate them partly because the process is so highly mystified. One aspect of this mystification, which gatekeepers use effectively against us, is the glamour around the secret ballot. That noble \"secrecy\" is what keeps citizen groups from observing the vote count, demanding verification slips, and so on.</p> <p>The secret vote was, in its time, a great idea. Before the secret ballot was popularized, it was standard practice to intimidate and threaten voters. But few know that America hasn't always had secret ballots. Indeed, the secret ballot didn't even originate in the US \u2013 the system we use is known, actually, as the \"Australian ballot\".</p> <p>The majority of US states did not move to that system \u2013 in which publicly-provided, printed ballots with the names of the candidates are marked in secret \u2013 until after 1884. Until 1891, indeed, Kentucky still held an \"oral ballot\"; and it wasn't till the election of President Grover Cleveland in 1892 that the first US president was elected entirely via secret ballot. </p> <p>Why do I point this out? Because our mystification of the secret ballot is one of the strange ways in which we treat our nation's voting system with truly weird magical thinking \u2013 much like the magical thinking (about which I have written here) that often attends global warming: a defiant, seven-year-old's refusal to connect point A and point B. By now, reams of solid reporting have documented the aberrations, high jinks, missing hard drives, voting machines that weirdly revert to one candidate, voting machines owned by friends of the candidate of one party, and other aspects of systematic corruption that attend America's voting.</p> <p>The dogged and deeply patriotic Mark Crispin Miller has meticulously documented masses more of these examples \u2013 notably in the last election in Ohio \u2013 in his <a href=\"http://harpers.org/archive/2005/08/none-dare-call-it-stolen/6/\">masterful Harper's essay last month, \"None Dare Call It Stolen.\"</a></p> <p>But this is what is weird about the way we are asked to think about the vote: as if nothing could ever ever ever go wrong with it, and as if it is crazy to entertain the notion that it might. To even raise the issue, with solid documentation, as many reporters and citizens have found out, is to risk immediate mockery \u2013 as Miller notes, citing 2004 headlines: \"Election Paranoia Surfaces: Conspiracy Theorists Call Results Rigged,\" chuckled the&#xa0;Baltimore Sun&#xa0;on 5 November; \"Internet Buzz on Vote Fraud is Dismissed,\" proclaimed the&#xa0;Boston Globe&#xa0;on 10 November; \"Latest Conspiracy Theory \u2013 Kerry Won \u2013 Hits the Ether,\" the&#xa0;Washington Post&#xa0;chortled on 11 November. </p> <p>Meanwhile, solid reporting on the war on voting, and on the corruption of the voting infrastructure, continues to mount, as in the <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-gop-war-on-voting-20110830\">Rolling Stone piece this summer on the GOP's \"war on voting\"</a>. and the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/23/pro-romney-firm-voting-machines_n_2006697.html\">Huffington Post notes the eyebrows raised</a> when a pro-Romney company buys a stake in the company that makes the machines that count our votes.</p> <p>Well, as a student of closing societies, I can tell you that it is crazy to ask Americans to have pure faith that the system is incorruptible, and to ask them to just drop their votes into a black hole and trust in the Lord \u2013 or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diebold#Premier_Election_Solutions_.2F_Diebold_Election_Systems\">Diebold</a>. If you look at weak democracies, the oligarchies that have taken undue control of them always seek to tamper with the vote. It is important for oligarchs to have elections to give their guy a veneer of legitimacy \u2013 and important for the vote always to turn out \"their way\". Indeed, something that is never reported in major news media here is that former President Carter's voting accountability organization sees America's system as relatively flawed and corrupted compared with the systems of many other nations. That is a situation that would typically bring observers from aid organizations like his to our polling places to help us count our vote. (See what happened to foreign poll observers in Miller's Harpers story who tried to watch the vote in America.)</p> <p>Here is my modest proposal: let us end the secret ballot, because we have reached a point, with the internet, in which transparency and accountability is more important than absolute secrecy. Don't panic, because this is what I mean: your vote won't be publicly available, but why can't I get a number when I hand in my ballot, or when I vote in a machine \u2013 just as I do with bloodwork, or computer passwords, or other transactions in which I get accountability, but not disclosure of my actual name? Then, the votes get tallied and posted \u2013 with their corresponding numbers \u2013 online on a public site, and major media reproduce the lists. And I can check my number (unidentifiable to anyone else) to check whether my vote was correctly registered.</p> <p>This would allow, in one sweep, all citizens to watch the watchers. It does not compel anyone to reveal his or her vote \u2013 but gives him or her the option of challenging a discrepancy, and the means to verify what he or she had actually intended to do. And in one easy, inexpensive, technically feasible gesture, it takes the power away from the Diebold-type private corporations and the various parties and the officials, and allows actual verification that cannot be spun or falsified. Most importantly, it removes a psychological blinder, which the American people are asked to wear every two and four years \u2013 the blinder that infantilizes us, that has highly interested individuals and groups say to us, \"we are impartial, this is a magically noble and incorruptible process: trust us.\"</p> <p>As President Ronald Reagan put it in another context: sure \u2013 <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust,_but_verify\">trust, but verify</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Ohio is where the warring halves of America meet. This midwestern state, mixing rural farmland, small towns and decaying industrial cities, is the ground zero of the bitter and protracted 2012 election that on Tuesday will decide who wins the White House.</p> <p>It is where blue state Americans, who back Barack Obama to win a second term, battle over turf with red state Americans who desperately want Republican challenger Mitt Romney to bring the right back to power.</p> <p>Ohio has voted for the winning candidate in very election bar one since 1944 (in 1960, it went for Nixon over Kennedy). No Republican has ever won the White House without taking Ohio. If Obama can stop Romney here, he is likely to emerge the victor. But if Romney can take the state it will signify a ground shift: one that will reduce Obama to a humbled, one-term president. Both sides know this.</p> <p>In the small town of Celina in western Ohio last week, the state's lieutenant-governor, Mary Taylor, was acting as a warm-up act for Romney and his running mate, Wisconsin congressman Paul Ryan. In a high school sports hall she warned a packed crowd: \"The world is watching Ohio.\" A day later, on the other side of the state \u2013 literally and metaphorically \u2013 former president Bill Clinton was oozing Arkansas charm in the \"rust belt\" city of Youngstown. \"Ohio is an old-school kind of state, and I mean that in the best possible sense,\" Clinton drawled. \"Obama had your back when you were against the wall, and you will have his back now.\"</p> <p>This, after months of brutal campaigning, is where it ends. All the heat and fury of almost two years of rallies and speeches, all the relentless attack ads, all the politicking and horse-trading, comes to a head this week.</p> <p>Across America there are only a nine states where votes matter. Giant states such as Texas and California are already in the bag for, respectively, Romney and Obama. Instead, these few swing states \u2013 from Colorado in the west to Florida in the south and tiny New Hampshire in New England \u2013 are the battleground on which the election has been fought. The fight there is poised on a knife edge. Romney's surge after the first presidential debate has abated and left the national polls largely tied. In the swing states \u2013 and, crucially, in Ohio \u2013 Obama holds a slim but steady lead. That means, as the election goes down to the wire, it is Obama who many believe has his nose just ahead.</p> <p>But the last week has seen a frantic final push. Across the swing states tens of thousands of party volunteers have gone door to door. The \"get out the vote\" plans for election day are being rehearsed and fine-tuned. Airwaves in the swing states are so saturated with political ads that in some areas there is no ad space left to buy. Even superstorm Sandy \u2013 which devastated the north-east \u2013 saw the campaign suspended for only a couple of days before combat resumed. By the time people vote on Tuesday a staggering $2.5bn will have been spent on the election \u2013 the most expensive in history.</p> <p>Yet in Ohio, despite the intense effort, two different realities stubbornly persist. John DeCaussim, a 56-year-old Youngstown mechanic, said he could not understand how anyone could vote for Romney. \"I have no idea why this election is close,\" he said. \"It shouldn't be.\" Meanwhile, in Celina sales manager Jim McGee, 62, believed Obama was a threat to the country's existence. \"He's been a disaster. In my lifetime I have never seen things fall apart so far,\" he said.</p> <p>For Republicans the importance of winning Ohio is maths and history. Every Republican president has had the state on his side. And almost every plan that party strategists have devised to grab the White House for Romney includes Ohio in the win column. As a result, the Romney campaign has been virtually camped in the state. Romney has visited almost 50 times this year alone. Ryan too has been a virtual ever-present.</p> <p>The state has seen a remarkable transformation of the Romney message over the last week. He has sought to shed his conservative image and long career in high finance and turn into an economic populist, emoting about tough economic times and bewailing the plight of the poor. In Findlay, Ohio, a small college town with a dilapidated Main Street, Romney was in full flow. He told stories of single mothers, low wages and parents making sacrifices so they could buy birthday presents for their children. For Romney, a millionaire many times over who has repeatedly extolled the virtues of high capitalism, it was a jarring performance. \"There has been a middle-class squeeze in this country,\" he said.</p> <p>Romney even started to sound like Obama circa 2008. He has adopted the \"change\" slogan as his own, portraying himself as an enemy of the status quo. \"I happen to think that the American people understand that we need dramatic and real change,\" he said. Ignoring the last three years of bitter politics and a Tea Party-dominated Republican party, he claimed to be a centrist, keen to reach out a Republican hand to Democrats, even though it is the same hand that has been rejecting Obama for his entire first term.</p> <p>But Romney as populist fist-pumper was as nothing compared to the musical act in Findlay. Before the teetotal, Mormon former Massachusetts governor took the stage, country music stars John Rich and Cowboy Troy, a black rapper, gave a lyrical performance, singing I Play Chicken with the Train. Rich suggested the crowd treat polling day like a drunken football game day party. \"I would make a tailgate party and go to vote for Mitt Romney. Put that man in the White House, can you hear? Oh yeah,\" Rich said. \"Put some beer in the cooler in the truck!\"</p> <p>But if such contradictory images were a sign of a notoriously fluid Romney, keen to find any message that sells in Ohio, there have also been signs in recent weeks of the Republican party's knife-sharp edge. Across America mysterious anonymous \"robo-texts\" slamming Obama have been buzzing millions of people's mobile phones. Billboards appeared in Ohio, and other swing states, apparently targeting poor and minority neighbourhoods with warnings of the threat of prison for voter fraud.</p> <p>On the airwaves the ads have got more extreme. A Romney ad claiming Jeep production was being moved to China was <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-gm-chrysler-rebut-romney-20121030,0,3345922.story\" title=\"\">condemned as an outright lie</a> by Jeep's own parent company, Chrysler. Another ad, running in Florida, linked Obama to Cuba's Fidel Castro and Venezuelan president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. Neither is virulent dislike for Obama hard to find, often tinged with a sense that the president is not really American. \"I want to support Romney the good old-fashioned American way,\" said construction worker Kevin Williams, 48, in Celina. \"I don't like socialism and Obama supports that.\"</p> <p>There is little doubt that Republicans are highly motivated. Maggie Niswaner is 73 but reckons she has walked more than 20 miles in the last week, knocking on doors and delivering pamphlets as a volunteer for Romney in Findlay. \"I am a good American,\" she said when asked for a reason why she was putting in such efforts to defeat Obama.</p> <p>The doom and gloom pumped out by the Romney campaign has worked, too. Though there is little doubt the economy is stuttering in its recovery, and unemployment remains high, but has been on a downward trend. But that is taboo on the Republican campaign trail. \"We have a jobs crisis in America,\" said Paul Ryan in Celina, pointing out that 23 million Americans were struggling to find enough work.</p> <p>But Ryan is right about one thing. It is a favourite part of the firebrand conservative's performance to read out a quote at the beginning of his stump speech. It goes: \"If you do not have fresh ideas, use stealth tactics to scare voters. If you do not have a record to run on, paint your opponent as someone that people should run from.\" Ryan then asks his audience who said that and delightedly gives the answer. \"That's what Barack Obama said when he was running for president four years ago. Now when you switch on the TV that is exactly what he has become,\" Ryan said in Findlay.</p> <p>There is much truth in the claim. Obama's re-election campaign, led by the hardnosed political operative David Axelrod, has been relentlessly negative. It has been a brutally sustained assault on Romney's image. One controversial \u2013 and widely debunked \u2013 attack ad all but accused Romney of killing a man's wife after she lost healthcare benefits. Obama has raised and spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative advertising and Bill Clinton and vice-president Joe Biden have become even punchier as the campaign has drawn to a close.</p> <p>In Youngstown, Clinton mocked Romney's flexibility of ideas, perhaps forgetting his own notorious \"triangulation\" of policy. \"Romney ties himself in more knots than a boy scout does at a knot-tying contest,\" Clinton quipped. Biden followed suit. \"This guy pirouettes more than a ballerina,\" he said, bringing a cry of \"Romney is a liar!\" from the audience.</p> <p>It is not a pretty end to Obama's campaign. And it is a long way from \"hope and change\". Though few ever expected Obama to fulfil the wild expectations of his historic 2008 election win, his first term has ended with a disappointed liberal base dismayed by broken promises on union rights and closing Guant\u00e1namo Bay and by a resounding defeat in the 2010 midterm elections. The result has been an Obama effort that has only hesitantly defended its main policy achievement of healthcare reform and has focused on attacking Republicans, rather than laying out any bold agenda.</p> <p>Yet, for many on the blue state side of Ohio's divide, that is more than enough. On the streets of Akron, a city at the heart of the north-eastern rust belt, student Cara Chappell remained loyal. \"When Obama came in it was already all messed up,\" she said. \"The next four years he will be able to get things right. He had to save the economy first.\"</p> <p>She cannot conceive of a Romney victory, even as she admits that her mother \u2013 who boasts a technology degree \u2013 cannot find work and might leave the state. \"If Romney wins, I will probably be speechless for the first time in my whole life,\" she said.</p> <p>So will Axelrod. Buoyed by polls showing that Obama is holding on to a slim lead in Ohio, his political guru was in a bullish mood. \"I don't want to be ambiguous at all: we are winning this race,\" he said.</p> <p>Of course, both sides cannot be right. Unless the election is so tight that it ends up in court decisions and recounts, either blue state America or red state America will triumph. But the warring sides agree on one thing. As Ryan looked out over an enthusiastic crowd of Republican true believers in Celina, he told them: \"Ohio, you get to decide.\" That decision \u2013 whatever it is \u2013 will affect the whole world.</p>",
