  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/binyamin-netanyahu\" title=\"\">Binyamin Netanyahu</a>, usually an exemplar of self-restraint, lost his temper last week. In a closed-door meeting discussing the military and intelligence chiefs who oppose an air strike against Iran, the Israeli prime minister snapped, \"I'm responsible, and if there's a commission of inquiry later it's on me,\" according to well-orchestrated leaks by his aides.</p> <p>Netanyahu seems to feel a historic \u2013 almost messianic \u2013 calling to stop Iran's nuclear programme. Even if retaliation by Iran and its allies in Hamas and Hezbollah takes the form of a lethal rain of rockets on Israel, he is adamant that a nuclear-armed Iran would be far worse.</p> <p>His latest set of outgoing signals seemed to suggest that an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities may be likely before America's presidential election in November. It is unclear if that is a coincidence, because of assessments that Iranian progress in uranium enrichment and bomb design will have reached a highly dangerous point by then; or maybe it is based on Netanyahu's calculation that President Barack Obama will be more supportive of Israel prior to election day \u2013 and perhaps not at all after he wins or loses on 6 November.</p> <p>Some of Israel's security chiefs, who do not hide their opposition to bombing Iran, say privately that they cannot discern if their PM is bluffing. Netanyahu may be creating the impression that an attack is imminent so as to goad the US into a firm promise to obliterate Iran's nuclear plants. He is certainly sincere in his concern about Iran's radical Islamists, who time and again call for the liquidation of the Jewish state. In this sense Netanyahu walks in the footsteps of Menachem Begin, prime minister from 1977 to 1983, who had a doctrine named after him: the absolute Israeli determination that no other nation in the Middle East will have nuclear weapons.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begin_doctrine\" title=\"\">Begin doctrine</a> was successfully implemented twice: by Begin himself in June 1981, when Israel's air force destroyed Iraq's nuclear reactor; and in September 2007, when PM Ehud Olmert sent Israeli warplanes to flatten a Syrian nuclear reactor. Olmert's decision was even bolder than Begin's: President George Bush had refused to order an American air raid, but Israel went ahead anyway. And, unlike Iraq, Syria is an immediate neighbour and had thousands of missiles that could hit every conceivable installation in Israel.</p> <p>Netanyahu may well be encouraged by the world's reaction. In 1981, even the pro-Israel president Ronald Reagan denounced the bombing of the Baghdad reactor; but a decade later, during Desert Storm, the US was thanking Israel for having ensured Saddam had no nuclear arms.</p> <p>In 2007 the initial reaction was less harsh, because the air raid on Syria was never acknowledged by the attackers in Jerusalem. But Israeli leaders justifiably feel that the international community might now be grateful to them again. There is concern in the US and Israel that Syria's chemical weapons might fall into the hands of al-Qaida or Hezbollah. Just imagine if the danger now involved what proliferation experts call \"loose nukes\".</p> <p>The unspoken motivation of both attacks was to preserve Israel's nuclear monopoly in the Middle East. While the Israeli arsenal is not confirmed officially, it is taken as a regional fact of life, even as Israel cannot countenance other nations in the region having the same weapons. For reasons both overt and covert, then, it should come as no surprise that Netanyahu may be feeling that a third time \u2013 in Iran \u2013 could be another attractive option. Hopefully it is not too late to prescribe an important dose of caution. Netanyahu and his few cabinet supporters \u2013 with defence minister Ehud Barak lately swinging back and forth between anti- and pro-attack positions \u2013 ought to know that the situation is different from 1981 or 2007.</p> <p>Iran is not Iraq or Syria. The Iranians have drawn lessons from those two events. They dispersed their nuclear facilities and buried them underground, making them more difficult to reach and destroy. Success is thus less assured. Instead of a quick, surgical strike, Israel will likely find itself in a long war of attrition against Iran and Shia Muslims everywhere. In the name of national pride and defending its Islamic revolution, Iran was willing to lose millions of people in a long war against Iraq through the 80s.</p> <p>Above all, perhaps, Israeli leaders must consider that striking Iran could drag the US into a war against its wishes. This would be bad for one of Israel's core survival strategies: the defence and intelligence alliance with America. It would be far wiser for Netanyahu and Barak \u2013 Israel's two prime decision makers \u2013 to focus their efforts on helping the international community \u2013 with America in the lead \u2013 do everything possible to eliminate the Iranian threat. They have to guard against talking themselves into a simple but bloody bilateral conflict that Israelis could well come to regret.</p> <p>Netanyahu has already achieved a lot with his innovative campaign to garner global attention. He can be satisfied his sabre-rattling has persuaded the world that Iran cannot be allowed to procure nuclear weapons. One can understand his fears that the world will let down Israel, a nation that prides itself on taking care of its own defence. Yet the wiser course now would be to tighten the alliance with the US and stand together against a common enemy.</p> <p>\u2022 Comments on this article will open tomorrow (Friday 10 August) morning</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hello, Ry. Where are you?</strong></p> <p>I'm in my house in Santa Monica. <strong><a href=\"#1\">(1</a><a name=\"1back\">)</a></strong></p> <p><strong>Have you been watching the Olympics? I'm in London where we've all been going crazy for the Games.</strong></p> <p>We see them late at night here, so we watch 'em a little.</p> <p><strong>Are you a sports fan?</strong></p> <p>Not really.</p> <p><strong>Did you see the opening ceremony? This will lead somewhere, this question, I hope ...</strong></p> <p>Oh, sure. Absolutely.</p> <p><strong>And what did you make of it?</strong></p> <p>Well, the whole thing with <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">the beds and the National Health</a> was interesting from over here, as you might well imagine.</p> <p><strong>Well, that's what I want to ask you about because </strong><a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2180227/London-2012-Olympics-Some-Americans-left-baffled-tribute-NHS-Mary-Poppins-Opening-Ceremony.html\" title=\"\"><strong>we read here</strong></a> <strong>that there was some criticism of that segment of the ceremony in the US.</strong></p> <p>Well, I didn't know there was any criticism of it at all. I hadn't heard that. First of all, you can't believe the media. You know that. I know it and you know it. So the propaganda against that concept ... I would take it on the same level as I would take the gun lobby on any notion that following <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/aurora-shooting\" title=\"\">some slaughter like out in Colorado</a> that anybody who says assault rifles should be banned is going to be roundly criticised and called a bad American. So naturally, in this particular year, we can look and see that the leading edge of Republican interference with our way of life is what they call Obamacare. And this is their flag that they hoist. So anyone that comes along with another idea, let alone anything as explicit as this piece in the opening ceremony, the first thing they have to do in the US media, which is pretty much controlled by the corporations, is to discredit it as fast and as hard as they possibly can. And any time you see anybody saying: \"Oh, the American people didn't like this, they resented it, etc\" ... they're lying.</p> <p>It's not for your benefit, it's for our benefit. So our population here learns, once again, that anything that's done for the people is wrong.</p> <p><strong>I don't know if you're familiar with the mayor of London, a character called Boris Johnson ...</strong></p> <p>Never heard of him.</p> <p><strong>He's a Conservative buffoon. He's so ridiculous that there's a point at which some people start to find him funny. Is there an element of that with the Sarah Palins of this world? Or are they too dangerous to ever find them funny? </strong></p> <p>They're too insanely dangerous. Look, what did Gore Vidal say recently? The interviewer asked him what he thought of the Republican party and he said it's not a party any more, it's a Hitler Youth mindset and they're out to destroy the country, and he was 110% right. So in case anybody thinks Michele Bachman or Sarah Palin are clowns because they misspeak or don't know their history or they say silly things: that's just an act, and it's a useful act. Everything is a distraction from the core truths which are, first of all, that corporations have taken over the country. </p> <p>This right now is the time of decision in this country. There's no other way to look at it. This is it. This is the most critical time in the history of the country, for chrissakes.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ct3BFR6GwFY?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"480\" height=\"295\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ct3BFR6GwFY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>Is Mitt Romney the least worst candidate to have emerged from the Republican ranks?</strong> <strong><a href=\"#2\">(2</a><a name=\"2back\">)</a></strong></p> <p>I don't agree with that. Romney is as bad as anyone can be. He's a dangerous man. He's a cruel man. He's a perfect creation for what the Republican party is all about. And that is to say, a rapacious capitalist. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jul/12/mitt-romney-bain-capital-live\" title=\"\">Anyone who ran Bain Capital is not your friend</a>. All they're going to do is rape and pillage the land. That's what he did at Bain Capital and that's what he's going to continue to do. Plus he can go around and in this guise of being a good buisnessman, which he's not .... and this face \u2013 with the big grin and everything \u2013 is jovial, but hollow. And it's outrageous if you analyse what he's saying, because he'll say one thing and do the opposite. And the media gives him a lot of attention. You know the story of the Olympics at Salt Lake City? Then he goes over to Great Britain and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jul/26/mitt-romney-london-olympic-games\" title=\"\">bad mouths the Olympics</a> over there ... But he's carrying an entourage of donors and he's putting on a dog and pony show for them. It takes a bit of study. People are so desperate over here now. They don't have the time to research and go back over the history of this guy. And everybody knows that. So what I'm trying to do with these little songs I write is say: let's look at this a different way. I don't write books and give speeches but with a four-minute song you can use allegory and other means to suggest a different point of view.</p> <p>It's like looking around the corner, and that's what songs are good at sometimes. They hit you with a new thought \u2013 assuming that people will listen. For instance, I like that idea that the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/koch-brothers\" title=\"\">Koch brothers</a> made a deal with Satan down at the crossroads. And that's useful because everyone understands what crossroads are all about \u2013 some of these songs call up and quote other songs. You've heard some of this material before, some of these lyric ideas, little inserts.</p> <p><strong>It's a bit different to the protest songs of the 60s. Is that because you think those songs were never really effective or because the times have changed?</strong></p> <p>Well, I don't know how to write soldier music. They were soldiers' songs so people could go out and hit the frontline. We shall overcome and so forth. And you need those types of songs. Especially in the Occupy movement. I think they're going to want to have songs like that, it'll be helpful. But I don't know how to do that really. That's a different kind of musical brain up there. So what I look at is these bleak stories: they're narratives and they introduce you to a character and the character says something.</p> <p>Irish songs function that way. They tell a little story. Or old time country music did that. It's not as direct. It's a little different.</p> <p><strong>But do you still find something inspiring in the idea of Woody Guthrie with his guitar and the slogan on it saying: \"</strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbulO_FB2ZI\" title=\"\"><strong>This machine kills fascists</strong></a><strong>\"?</strong></p> <p>Sure. He was a great storyteller in music. He was perfect. He had a good visual sense, so those tunes ... you can see them, I always thought. He had a gift for making songs out of things. He went and saw [the 1940 film] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grapes_of_Wrath_%28film%29\" title=\"\">The Grapes of Wrath</a>, I was told, and wrote <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKWGAGPy_kw\" title=\"\">Tom Joad</a> in one night, this whole epic song with umpteen verses. Because he'd seen it, he knew how to do it, I think.</p> <p>He lived through the depression and the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Worst-Hard-Time-Survived/dp/0618773479\" title=\"\">dustbowl</a> and so he turned his mind there. It's always good to listen to his thing. Now we're listening to him again on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/jul/07/woody-guthrie-centenary-protest-songs\" title=\"\">the 100th anniversary of his birth</a>.</p> <p><strong>Is that something which has been lost from songwriting? I'm reminded of something I think Bob Dylan said about the sinking of the Titanic: within months, there were dozens of songs telling the story from a different perspective. Nowadays, people don't expect that from music, they turn to TV.</strong></p> <p>I know. The whole idea of lifestyle has corrupted everything. So if you're going to be a musician you have to present yourself as some sort of demonstration of some sort of lifestyle that's useful to people who have to demonstrate lifestyles: to sell clothes, liquor, or something. Disney started this. So the vocabulary of the music has changed a lot from, let's say, 1970 onwards. It's more about the person and what they seem to be, rather than what they think or what they've experienced.</p> <p>Once the record companies grew to being corporations it was obvious that those corporate managers would say: \"Hey, let's stop talking about unions, let's stop talking about bank fraud. We'd rather talk about sales. What can we sell here?\" Then we put it up on TV and the advertisers get happy because it sells their product. You know it's useful that way.</p> <p>Now, beneath the corporate level and beneath the lifestyle element, you're going to start to see more folks on the ground doing this again: playing instruments for that reason, expressing something. They have to find this again, young people, right? They might even want to do it again. I'm starting to see this, I think.</p> <p><strong>Does social media have a role in this?</strong></p> <p>I don't trust social media \u2013 I think it's all a bunch of bullshit. I think it's a manoeuvre. It's Orwellian. This small screen is going to hypnotise you. You're going to do what it wants you to do. What does it want you to do? It wants you to text your friend. What are you saying to your friend? You're going to say: \"I'm on the corner!\" \u2013 and your friend says: \"I'm on the other corner!\" Is that what you're saying ... is that what you're thinking? Wait a minute.You don't even know what you think and what you feel if that's what you're doing all day and night.</p> <p>Besides, all this social media \u2013 they're hooked to transactions in some way and they're delivering this massive audience \u2013 to whom? So I don't like it and I don't trust it.</p> <p>They say: \"Oh, the Arab Spring!\" Well, the goddamn military took over Egypt anyway in the end. Who says they got a revolution? What revolution? The fucking military went in there like they always have done.</p> <p>To me, the point is you turn the screen off and listen to yourself and maybe you'll have an idea. Maybe it might be a good idea, something you can do to help out.</p> <p><strong>I hate to say it, but it's almost like California's gift to the world \u2013 both with music in the 70s and with people like Steve Jobs \u2013 they both appear to be about empowerment and choice but actually it's the opposite.</strong></p> <p>I agree.</p> <p><strong>Do you feel that's true of the the generation that you were part of? They pretended to be this great thing but you look back \u2026 and what did they really change?</strong> <strong><a href=\"#3\">(3</a><a name=\"3back\">)</a></strong></p> <p>The idea of change is overrated. Change in what way? A big change was Lyndon Johnson passing <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_Rights_Act\" title=\"\">the Voting Rights Act</a>. They didn't want to do it. The Democrats didn't want to do it and the Republicans damn sure didn't want to do it. Eisenhower didn't want to do it and Kennedy didn't want to do it \u2013 but they had to do it. That's a whole story in itself. But now you have new Jim Crow laws \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jun/12/florida-panel-stand-your-ground-law\" title=\"\">stand-your-ground law</a> is already responsible for about 80 shooting deaths of African Americans. That's bringing lynching back. That's bringing Jim Crow back. Can you imagine? Could this be true? Well, it is true, if you see it that way. I do. I keep trying to say it with these songs till I'm blue in the face. But it's a fact. That's what going on in this country right now. That's why Vidal called it a Hitler Youth mindset. This is real shocking stuff.</p> <p><strong>On the new album, the song Cold Cold Feeling pictures President Obama pacing the Oval Office on his own in the dark. Is he a good man trapped in an impossible situation?</strong></p> <p>Yes, 110%. He's set upon by dogs. He's prevented from doing anything because the Republicans ensured that no president and no Democrat president can ever do good again. That's what Bush was sent in there to do: destroy the presidency, and that's what I think he did. How do you come back from that? How do you make the presidency good again? They talk about bi-partisanship but that's an empty word, doesn't mean a thing. So what is Obama supposed to do? How can he operate? This healthcare thing is really quite something, if it lives. They're going to go after it and try to destroy it, that's the leading end of the Republican effort right now, that's going to sink the Titanic, you know?</p> <p>I mean, I think he's a good man. He's a smart man. He understands the constitution, therefore he must respect it. They don't. I believe that he does.</p> <p><strong>Was this record born of a sense of duty </strong><strong>\u2013 because someone needs to stand up and say something \u2013 </strong><strong>or therapy to work out your anger? </strong></p> <p>It's a bit of both. I want to say something because I think you should if you can. It's challenging, but it's fun. I like to write these songs. I mean, yeah, otherwise what are you going to do, pound your fist on the table? That's no good. Then they win big time because they got you cornered. Music is the way that I know. It's the thing I have.</p> <p><strong>Do you sometimes feel like you've had enough \u2013 isn't there the temptation to flee somewhere else, and do something like make another record with the Buena Vista crew?</strong> <strong><a href=\"#4\">(4</a><a name=\"4back\">)</a></strong></p> <p>First of all, the old-timers are gone, or they are in places where I can't find 'em, or wouldn't know where to look. It's 2012 right now, so who's left?</p> <p>The thing about music is you never know when the next impulse is coming from. So since we're surrounded with issues, in this very unstable time ... there's that sense of \"let's do this now... let's write something here\".</p> <p><strong>Do you listen to much new music?</strong> <strong>Any hip-hop?</strong></p> <p>No, I don't. It's better to listen to something I like. There's always something there that's helpful or interesting \u2013 that's how I get myself moving. Plus, I sit and play the instruments. That doesn't change so much. I get better at it, but it's the same music.</p> <p><strong>Is it important that people realise that music is something you can make \u2013 you don't just consume it?</strong></p> <p>That's right.</p> <p><strong>Do you worry that the world's cultures are disappearing?</strong></p> <p>Of course. Like with any species. You worry about birds, you worry about insects. you worry about plants \u2026 the Earth. Yes, what a struggle. Culture is fragile. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/mali\" title=\"\">Look at Mali right now</a>. That's the death of music there. That's gone now ...</p> <p><strong>In the face of all this, what do you do? What do you take pleasure in apart from music?</strong></p> <p>I'm a big fan of trees. I like to go see where they grow. California is beautiful \u2013 apart from the freeways and the malls and the prisons. You can still go out into nature. I'm a big fan of light. I'm a big fan of the way the sun is in the air here.</p> <p>We have a very nice life here. Our little house where little Susie and me are ... and Joachim is great. Playing music with him, just the two of us, we have a great time. <strong><a href=\"#5\">(5</a><a name=\"5back\">)</a></strong> I'm having the best time of life I've had in 65 years. </p> <h2><strong>Footnotes</strong></h2> <p><a name=\"1\">(1)</a>.

  "<p>Diplomats filing into the conference room at Afghanistan's finance ministry had expected a bland update on accountability targets from the finance minister.</p> <p>Instead, he brought out personal financial papers and begged for support in the face of what he described as politically motivated corruption allegations, eventually breaking down in tears.</p> <p>Hazrat Omar Zakhilwal, a young technocrat who has been lionised as a dynamic reformer by many western diplomats, said he had \"acted naively\" in his handling of $2m (\u00a31.3m) of campaign funds for President Hamid Karzai's re-election campaign in 2009, but denied any wrongdoing.</p> <p>He launched an impassioned 45-minute defence of his behaviour, waving bank statements and tax receipts, and said he feared for his life and his family's safety because of his role in trying to clear up a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/16/kabul-bank-afghanistan-financial-scandal\" title=\"\">$900m banking scandal</a>, according to sources who attended the meeting, or heard first-hand accounts.</p> <p>One diplomat described the meeting as \"more emotional than factual\". Zakhilwal began weeping towards the end of the meeting and had to leave the room briefly, several sources said, but he returned to finish his presentation.</p> <p>Stunned diplomats, gathered from across the international community and including senior UN officials, made no comments and asked no questions. \"I don't think he necessarily expected support in the room,\" said one western diplomat. \"But maybe he was hoping that the major donor nations \u2013 ones like the US, Britain, Japan \u2013 would tell Karzai that if he tries to sack him and cannot replace him with a credible minister to follow up on [<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/08/afghanistan-donation-corruption-concerns-tokyo\" title=\"\">funding commitments from July's] Tokyo [aid conference</a>], that funds may be reduced.\"</p> <p>Afghanistan's Tolo television station made allegations late last month that Zakhilwal had stashed large quantities of money overseas.</p> <p>But he has hit back with a formal request for the attorney general to investigate his finances, saying the money was earned legitimately from lucrative consulting work done before he took office in 2009, and real estate investments buoyed by Afghanistan's decade-long property boom.</p> <p>An aide, Najib Manalai, told the Guardian that descriptions of the minister crying in Wednesday's meeting were \"exaggerated\" and said he had not expressed concerns about his family's safety.</p> <p>Zakhilwal denied he had asked for support, or that he had admitted any mistakes in handling election funds.</p> <p>\"I have not asked donors for help, in fact don't need their help. I had invited them to brief them on what was going on and about my decision to ask the attorney general to investigate both the accusation against me as well as violations of my rights,\" he said in an emailed message.</p> <p>Diplomatic sources confirmed details, including Zakhilwal's tears. One said he wept in front of the ambassadorial corps. The $2m figure he cited in connection to the election, and the request for support, were also mentioned, said a diplomat.</p> <p>Many diplomats in Kabul, despite their commitment to fighting Afghanistan's rampant graft, recognise that it is difficult for senior officials to stay entirely clean in a system of patronage politics riven with corruption. Some take a pragmatic \"good enough\" approach to working with and supporting officials they consider relatively untainted.</p> <p>There is little doubt that Zakhilwal created enemies with his handling of Kabul Bank, a lender that nearly collapsed in late 2010 when it emerged that members of the Kabul elite had been treating it as a kind of private piggybank.</p> <p>The government's slow handling of the scandal jeopardised millions of dollars in aid last year and Zakhilwal played a key role in convincing international donors that Kabul was making progress.</p> <p>Officials argue they have now drawn up charge sheets and recovered tens of millions of dollars, but critics point out that there have still been no prosecutions.</p> <p>\"Kabul Bank, he said, is certainly a big factor in the smearing campaign,\" the aide Manalai said when asked about Zakhilwal's comments that he was being persecuted for his clean-up efforts.</p> <p>The question marks over Zakhilwal's job come just after parliament voted to unseat the defence and interior ministers, leaving the country without its two most important security officials in the middle of the fighting season.</p> <p>The defence minister, Abdul Rahim Wardak, who stepped down shortly after the vote, was another western favourite who had been in the job for eight years. Diplomats warned that his departure could complicated the handover of security from foreign to Afghan forces.</p>",

Romney's former Republican rival, Newt Gingrich, said it was \"truly tragic\" that such an ad should be running in a presidential campaign.</p> <p>One of the main Super Pacs backing Obama re-election efforts, Priorities USA Action, released the ad on Tuesday evening. But in spite of the heavy criticism, the group is refusing to back down and will go ahead with plans to run it in swing states.</p> <p>In the ad, former steelworker Joe Soptic recounts how when Bain Capital, which Romney headed, shut down his steel plant in 2001, he lost his family health benefits. His wife died of cancer five years later.</p> <p>\"I do not think Mitt Romney realises what he's done to anyone. And furthermore, I do not think Mitt Romney is concerned,\" Soptic says in the ad.</p> <p>The Romney campaign said the ad is misleading: the woman died years after Romney left Bain Capital \u2013 running the Salt Lake Olympics rather than Bain in 2001 \u2013 and that the woman had health coverage through her own job.</p> <p>The Republican campaign has been critical of the ad since it was first made public but Romney only commented for the first time on Thursday. </p> <p>In an interview, Romney told Bill Bennett's Morning in America radio show: \"I don't know what happened to the campaign of hope and change.\"</p> <p>Without referring directly to the ad, he said: \"You know, in the past, when people pointed out that something was inaccurate, why, campaigns pulled the ad. They were embarrassed. Today, they just blast ahead. You know, the various fact-checkers look at some of these charges in the Obama ads and they say that they're wrong, and inaccurate, and yet he just keeps on running them.\"</p> <p>The row over the ad comes as polls show the White House race almost tied. Real Clear Politics, in its poll average, puts Obama on 47.5% to Romney's 44.1%.</p> <p>But Romney is set to dominate headlines in the coming weeks, firstly with his vice-presidential pick and then with the Republican convention, beginning in Tampa, Florida, on 27 August.</p> <p>After being formally nominated as the Republican presidential candidate, he will be free to spend the millions of dollars in campaign funds he has been accumulating in recent months.</p> <p>Bill Burton, founder of Priorities USA Action, in an interview on Wednesday night insisted the ad will be run as planned in swing states at a cost of about $20m. He denied the ad suggests Romney was responsible Soptic's wife's death</p> <p>\"We're not saying Mitt Romney is culpable for that. What we're saying is that Joe Soptic was fired from his job, and as a result of that, he wasn't able to get \u2026 he wasn't able to hold onto healthcare benefits that were promised to him. And as a result, when his wife got sick, he didn't have healthcare.\"</p> <p>Another of Romney's former Republican rivals, Tim Pawlenty, also joined the criticism. In comments distributed by the Romney campaign, Pawlenty accused Obama supporters of putting out negative ads to distract attention from his record as president.</p> <p>Pawlenty, former governor of Minnesota, is being talked of as a possible candidate to becoming Romney's vice-presidential running-mate. Other potential picks include congressman Paul Ryan and Ohio senator Rob Portman. The Romney campaign said the decision will be announced \"soon\".</p>",
  "<p>Most of Mitt Romney's newest Twitter followers are fake, according to an investigation of bogus social media accounts.</p> <p>A pay-for-follower service most likely drove the presumptive Republican nominee's recent and dramatic spike in online followers, <a href=\"http://www.barracudalabs.com/wordpress/?p=2989\">concluded Baccardua Labs</a>, a digital security company.</p> <p>The widely reported surge in tens of thousands of new followers for <a href=\"http://twitter.com/mittromney\">@mittromney</a> from 21 July \u2013 which provoked commentary and suspicion \u2013 appeared to have been purchased from a dealer, it said: \"We believe most of these recent followers of Romney are not from a general Twitter population but most likely from a paid Twitter follower service.\"</p> <p>The analysis, part of a wider investigation into what the report called the underground Twitter economy, found telltale signals that about a quarter of the new followers were less than three weeks old and had not tweeted. Some 80% were less than three-months-old.</p> <p>The report's author, Jason Ding, said there was no way of identifying whether it was the work of the Romney campaign, a Romney supporter or an opponent out to discredit him.</p> <p>\"Romney's newest followers could have been paid for by himself, his associates or by his opponents. So far, there is not a feasible way to confirm who is responsible.\"</p> <p>Authentication was not required when buying Twitter followers from eBay or other websites, he said, and anyone could buy followers for other Twitter users.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394452544\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/8/1344454948537/mitt-romney-twitter-006.jpg\" alt=\"mitt romney twitter\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As of Wednesday, Romney had nearly 800,000 followers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: twitter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Zac Moffat, the Romney campaign digital director, denied that his side was responsible. \"The Romney campaign does not buy Twitter followers,\" <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57487861-93/mitt-romney-suspiciously-gets-116k-twitter-followers-in-one-day/\">he told CNET</a>. \"We have reached out to Twitter to find out additional information regarding the rapid growth.\"</p> <p>By Wednesday afternoon @mittromney had more than 792,800 followers. He gained 116,922 in a single day, 21 July. Around a tenth have since been suspended by Twitter.</p> <p>Barracuda said this fit a wider pattern of clandestine Twitter trading which it began studying in May. \"Our team set up three Twitter accounts and purchased between 20,000 and 70,000 Twitter followers for each of them from eBay and another website searched from Google.\"</p> <p>It identified \"dealers\" who charge an average of $18 for 1,000 followers. A dealer can earn up to $800 a day for 7 weeks of selling followings if they can control 20,000 fake accounts, it said. They can earn extra revenue by selling tweets and re-tweets.</p> <p>The report defined dealers' clients as \"abusers\", with the average abuser boasting 48,885 followers. The phenomenon of fake accounts is not new. The oldest was said to be @krails, created on 15 January 2007. Dealers controlled the following speed and total following number of fake accounts to avoid being suspended by Twitter. \"Dealers can apply obscure techniques to make them hard to detect, eg randomly following some famous and some average people, or posting tweets grabbed from the Twitter stream, etc.\"</p> <p>Prices for 1,000 followers ranged widely from $2 to $55 depending on how \"real\" they seemed. \"This underground Twitter business is just blooming,\" the report said.</p>",

Published a week before A-level results come out, the report says that the number of university applicants in England dropped by 8.8% this year compared with the tally for 2010.</p> <p>And there was a 7.2% fall in numbers of 18- and 19-year-old applicants in England between this year and 2010, the last year of applications before the cap on tuition fees was raised.</p> <p>The decline in England has not been mirrored in other parts of the UK where fees have not been raised, and the drop can only partly be explained by falling numbers of young people in the population, the commission says.</p> <p>Students from Scotland attending Scottish universities do not pay fees, while the Welsh assembly says it will pay fees above \u00a33,465 for Welsh students attending UK institutions. Fees for students from Northern Ireland are also capped at \u00a33,465.</p> <p>About one person in 20 who would have been expected to have applied to university this year (if the trend of increasing application rates among English school-leavers was maintained) did not do so, the report says. This equates to approximately 15,000 young applicants.</p> <p>The commission is chaired by Will Hutton, principal of Hertford College, Oxford, and a former Observer editor, and also includes Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust, Stephen Machin, professor of economics at University College London, and the journalist Libby Purves.</p> <p>Hutton said: \"We're asking our young men and women to assume more debt than any other country in the world \u2013 it's higher than the average debt in the US. It's not clear whether those lost this year will return to the fold next year, or [if] it's a storm warning of a worrying trend.\"</p> <p>The commission's report says there does not seem to be a disproportionate impact on poorer or less advantaged communities. The commission found there was no significant change in the application rate to the most selective universities, such as Oxford or Cambridge.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.offa.org.uk/press-releases/offa-announces-decisions-on-2013-14-access-agreements/\" title=\"\">average tuition fee</a> at English universities this year is \u00a38,385, rising to \u00a38,507 next year. UK and EU students are entitled to take out government-backed loans to pay the fees.</p> <p>Hutton said: \"Although it is too early to draw any firm conclusions, this study provides initial evidence that increased fees have an impact on application behaviour. There's a clear drop in application numbers from English students when compared to their counterparts in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p> <p>\"On a positive note, we are pleased to see that, at this stage, there has been no relative drop-off in applicants from less advantaged neighbourhoods. We will continue to monitor a range of indicators as the fee increases work their way through the system.\"</p> <p>A National Foundation for Educational Research survey of pupils found tuition fees and overall university costs were the most common factors deterring young people from studying for a degree.</p> <p>However the survey of 1,000 pupils aged 15-18, conducted this April, found that the majority expected to go on to higher education.</p> <p>Liam Burns, president of the National Union of Students, said: \"We have always said it would be a tragedy if any young person were put off applying to or going to university because of financial concerns.\"</p> <p>Any inquiry into the impact of fees had to look beyond applications to explore how varying fee levels affected the choices made by candidates from different backgrounds, Burns said.</p> <p>Demand for university places still outstrips supply, and A-level results next Thursday will trigger a scramble for places. There were 700,000 applicants for university last year, of whom 492,030 were accepted. So far this year, there have been more than 618,000 applications for about the same number of degree course places.</p> <p>The universities minister David Willetts said: \"We do accept that after a peak last year, applications are down from 31.6% of people applying to university to 30.6%. That is actually still the second highest rate of applications on record.\"</p> <p>He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: \"We still have very strong demand for university.\"</p> <p>Willetts said the new system, which saw students start repaying their fees after they had graduated and were earning \u00a321,000 a year or more, was fairer and \"much more like an income tax\".</p> <p>A spokeswoman at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills which is responsible for universities, said: \"Even with a small reduction in applications, this will still be a competitive year like any other as people continue to understand that university remains a good long-term investment in their future.</p> <p>\"Students should not be put off going to university for financial reasons. Most students will not have to pay upfront, and no one will have to start paying back their student loan until they start to earn at least \u00a321,000 per year.\"</p>"
