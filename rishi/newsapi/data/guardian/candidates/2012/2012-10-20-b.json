  "<p>Just how thick is Nick Griffin? Is it even measurable? Or is he just so desperate for publicity for his ailing party that he'd do anything to grub up a few headlines, bar perhaps roller-skate past Westminster naked?</p> <p>The BNP leader tweeted the home address (partial address, he says) of the gay couple <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-20000954\" title=\"\">Michael Black and John Morgan</a>, who won damages against the Christian owners of a B&amp;B who'd refused them a room. In the tweets, encouraging his followers to demonstrate outside Black and Morgan's home, Griffin said he wanted to bring them \"a bit of drama\".</p> <p>The police are now investigating whether Griffin's tweets were illegal. For his part, Griffin says that \"drama\" referred to the gay couple's involvement in amateur dramatics. But of course \u2013 a fondness for the work of Alan Ayckbourn goes hand in hand with a desire to see a mob of baying \"patriots\" appear at your door. Then there was Griffin's baffling sign-off: \"Say No to heterophobia!\"</p> <p>Does Griffin really live in a dark parallel universe where heterophobia needs to hear the word \"No\"? Where straight-bashing is on the rise \u2013 innocent heterosexual men leaving pubs, to be confronted by hordes of pissed-up Marys in Kylie T-shirts swinging baseball bats, crying: \"You women-fancying perverts are going to pay!\"? On Planet Griffin, are straight couples campaigning for the right to marry, straight parents frowned upon everywhere save for a few trendy London boroughs?</p> <p>Moreover, are schoolchildren thoughtlessly taunting each other with slang such as: \"That's just straight\"? Are some of these children committing suicide rather than facing coming out as \"non-gay\"? Is there is a culture in film and TV for there to be a token straight, who spouts straight cliches and affects straight mannerisms and has little else to do but be an amusing straight best friend for the lead gay characters to bounce off?</p> <p>Many apologies for the myriad cliches tumbling over each other back there. The point I'm trying to make is that, considering all the evidence or, indeed, lack of, it seems highly unlikely that heterophobia exists in any entrenched, meaningful or malign way.</p> <p>Not that I'm denying its existence. It appears that a (very) tiny minority of gay people self-define as heterophobic, because they're so sickened by straight society and its treatment of them. Eminem referenced <a href=\"http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eminem/criminal.html\" title=\"\">heterophobia </a>in a lyric (Criminal). <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Heterophobia-Harassment-Feminism-American-Intellectual/dp/0847689883\" title=\"\">At least one book has been written about it</a>. An Australian MP used the term in his campaign against same sex unions. But heterophobia as a looming social evil that requires scrutiny, legislation and an anguished cry of \"Just say no!\"? Nah, I'm not buying it.</p> <p>The gay couple's court win was always a no-brainer. A person's sexuality should have as little to do with hiring a room at a B&amp;B as it does with buying a doughnut at a bakery, or a meal at a restaurant. If the B&amp;B owners Susanne and Mike Wilkinson are so appalled by the implications of the Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2007, then perhaps they should reconsider their future in the hospitality industry.</p> <p>As for Griffin, I suppose he got the attention he so desperately craved (including this). What we seem to have here is a prime example of the anti-PC back-flip scam. This is where a quite reasonable argument against prejudice is crudely reversed, and then run with, to occasionally hilarious, though, more frequently, desperately boring effect. Thus with homophobia, it's: \"You're criticising me for what I believe, so that makes you (ta-da!) heterophobic!\" Similarly, racism: \"Yeah, well, you're hostile to my views, so that makes you (ta-da!) racist to white people.\" It's tiring, it's pathetic, but, slowly, surely, everyone is cottoning on. So, sorry Mr Griffin, the next time you want to generate headlines, it might be easier to go and fetch your roller-skates.</p> <h2>Oh, I say. This rapping lark's a bit oikish, isn't it? </h2> <p>One presumes that everyone has viewed the video of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2012/oct/19/eton-gangnam-style-lingo-explained\" title=\"\">Eton boys</a> rapping and throwing shapes, Gangnam style, in their tails. A bit of harmless tomfoolery that verges on the moving. Especially when they wail about how insecure they sometimes feel. (Ultra-posh boys finding it difficult to talk to girls \u2013 who knew?) In the event, it's touching to see boys \"dad-dancing\" in their teens.</p> <p>Bless their toff hearts for putting themselves out there, seemingly with no thought for any future political ambitions.</p> <p>Sadly, however, it must be noted that this whole thing exposes the Eton-fruggers as being (deep breath) somewhat common. All that bragging about consuming Mo\u00ebt and camembert \u2013 isn't it all a bit squeezed-middle wish-fulfilment? I'm sure their parents have brought them up to namecheck much posher stuff than that \u2013 it must have been a dagger to Mater and Pater's hearts that the Harvey Nicks food hall wasn't mentioned even once.</p> <p>So, an amusing viral sensation, but something of a tragic own goal for Eton. You don't pay its fees for boys to use the same cultural references as oiks from the local comp. I predict a surge in interest in Rugby and Harrow.</p> <h2>Tagg, you impulsive old redneck, you</h2> <p>Tagg Romney has said that he wanted to rush the stage and \"take a swing\" at Barack Obama, for his insinuations about his father Mitt's integrity during their latest US presidential debate. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/us-election/9617247/Tagg-Romney-wanted-to-take-swing-at-Obama.html\" title=\"\">Tagg</a> (short for Taggart) says that the thing that stopped him \u2013 the only thing, mind \u2013 was the presence of secret service officers surrounding Obama. If they hadn't been there, Tagg seems to be implying, Obama would have been \"for it\", good and proper.</p> <p>Well, some might say, young Tagg is hardly a credit to his illustrious background with such dockers' vernacular as \"taking a swing\". Was Tagg dragged up? some might wonder.</p> <p>But to them, I say, can't a young lad, with passion in his soul, stand up for his old man, even to the point of threatening his opponent with adolescent violence. Perhaps with a cry of \"Put your dukes up, Obama\", as the impetuous hothead hurdles over seats to uphold the family honour. It might not be right, but it's wrong in a good way. A bit like <em>Godfather II,</em> only with mom's apple pie for tea. More importantly, it's eminently understandable in a callow youth.</p> <p>To which some \u2013 in fact, let's hope all \u2013 might reply: \"What are you talking about, you misinformed, platitude-spewing hack? The weirdly named proto-meathead Tagg is a 42-year-old married millionaire father of six. He's also one of his father's chief advisers and should know better than to talk openly about wanting to duff up his father's opponent in a radio interview.\" To which I reply: \"You're absolutely right, sit down and shut up, Tagg, you embarrassingly privileged, emotionally incontinent redneck.\" As a sidebar: Mitt? Tagg? If they want a decent chance at power, this family really must sort their names out.</p> <p>Comments will be turned on later</p>",
  "<p>American civil rights groups have appealed to the world's biggest election monitoring organisation over concerns about controversial changes in voter registration ahead of the November 6 White House poll.</p> <p>The eight civil rights group expressed their worry that millions, including those on low income as well as minorities, could be excluded from the vote for the presidency and for members of Congress.</p> <p>They raised the issues during a meeting on Tuesday in Washington with representatives from the Organisation of Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), which represents 56 states in Europe, Central Asia and North America.</p> <p>The OSCE is likely to refer to the concerns in an interim report on the US elections out at the end of next week. It is also expected to pass on the views of the civil rights groups to its team of international observers who are being sent to monitor elections in 40 states.</p> <p>The OSCE opened its observer mission in the US on October 9, led by OSCE ambassador Daan Everts. It has 13 international experts based in DC and 44 long-term observers from 23 countries being deployed throughout the country.</p> <p>Its mission is to assess the election for compliance with international obligations and standards for democratic elections.</p> <p>In a statement, it said: \"The mission will analyse the legislative framework and its implementation and will follow campaign activities, the work of the election administration and relevant government bodies, including voter registration, and the resolution of election disputes.'</p> <p>The eight civil rights groups, who include the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and the NAACP, asked the OSCE to send election monitors to the states most affected by voter restrictions.</p> <p>They cited new restrictions on voting periods and voter ID laws aimed at disenfranchising women, the young, the elderly and disabled, as well as minorities and those on low income.</p> <p>The states identified as places they would like to see observers deployed are Pennsylvania, Ohio, Florida, Texas and Wisconsin.</p> <p>The OSCE, as well as issuing interim reports before the election, will also publish its finding immediately after the election and a more considered verdict a few months later.</p>",
  "<p>For the second Saturday running, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney went to ground to prep for a televised debate that could prove crucial in a tight White House race now entering its home straight.</p> <p>President Obama hunkered down in Camp David ahead of the third head-to-head with his Republican rival. He is due to remain there until Monday night's encounter, leaving the donkey work of the campaign to his deputy Joe Biden, who hit the stump in Florida on Saturday.</p> <p>Likewise, Romney was leaving nothing to chance ahead of the foreign policy debate, having slipped up on the topic in the last match-up between the pair \u2013 an occurrence that seemingly arrested his momentum ahead of the November 6 vote.</p> <p>Romney is due to spend the weekend in Florida boning up on the issues. Meanwhile his vice-presidential pick, Paul Ryan, is due to campaign in the Democratic-leaning battleground of Pennsylvania on Saturday.</p> <p>Political pundits have by-and-large scored the two presidential debates in this race 1-1, with Obama winning the second after a poor performance in the first initially handed the electoral running to Romney.</p> <p>Monday's debate, due to be held in Boca Raton, Florida, and moderated Bob Schieffer of CBS News, is dedicated solely to foreign affairs.</p> <p>It should be a strong area for the president, as he consistently tops polls as to which of the candidates is more trusted on international affair. During his tenure at the White House, Obama has pulled American troops out of Iraq and presided over drawdown in Afghanistan \u2013 both popular measures in a country grown weary by more than a decade of war.</p> <p>Additionally, terror chief Osama bin Laden was assassinated by a US crack team under the president's watch, providing a further boost to his claims of competence in pushing forward US objectives overseas.</p> <p>But the timing of the debate isn't great for the White House incumbent, coming just weeks after a confused response from the administration over a deadly attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya.</p> <p>The assault resulted in the death of four Americans, including ambassador Chris Stevens. It also, so the Republicans claim, raised questions over Obama's foreign policy and leadership after conflicting messages over who was responsible for the assault were initially released.</p> <p>On Friday, Ryan continued to needle the president over claims that he should have known earlier that militants were responsible for the consulate siege, and not, as some in the administration appeared to initially think, that it was the work of protesters angered by an anti-Islam film produced in the US.</p> <p>Ryan told Wisconsin radio station WTAQ that the Benghazi attack and its handling by the president represented the \"absolute unravelling of the Obama administration's foreign policy\".</p> <p>But some believe that the Republican ticket has already overplayed the attack for political advantage.</p> <p>An attempt to press the president over the semantic point of whether he actually called it an \"act of terror\" the day after the siege, backfired on Romney in the second debate.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the White House has been trying to put some distance between Obama and the initial confusion over who was behind the Benghazi killings, seemingly shifting the blame for the response on the State Department.</p> <p>On Monday, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she took responsibility over the response.</p> <p>\"In the wake of an attack like this, in fog of war, there's always going to be confusion,\" she explained.</p> <p>It is likely that any exchange over the Benghazi incident at Monday's debate will be closely watched for inconsistencies. But whether or not the Republicans can make enough of it to overturn a perceived advantage for Obama on foreign policy remains to be seen.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Obama and Biden have been focusing their attack on Romney's apparent policy shifts on issues such as women's health, dismissively referring to moves by the Republican hopeful to appeal to the centre as \"Romnesia\".</p> <p>With the race now bending into the home straight, Monday night's debate could provide a final chance for both White House contenders to land a few blows in front of an audience of tens of million voters.</p> <p>Perhaps of equal importance, both will be eager to avoid any verbal missteps or gaffes that could provide the 24-news networks with the equivalent of a water-cooler moment to play relentlessly in the days leading up to 6 November.</p>",
  "<p>President Barack Obama's campaign to win a second term in the White House is approaching the end of the US election cycle flush with cash after yet another massive month of fundraising.</p> <p>The latest figures from the Federal Election Commission (FEC) show that Obama for America pulled in a total haul of more than $126m in September.</p> <p>The campaign, which has faced a resurgent Republican challenge from Mitt Romney ahead of the 6 November ballot, now sits atop a cash mountain of some $100m as money taken in has outstripped money spent so far.</p> <p>The news provides a welcome shot in the arm for the Obama team which appeared to be cruising to a comfortable lead in the polls before a poor performance by Obama in the first presidential debate in Denver saw the race suddenly narrow.</p> <p>The impressive fundraising total means the Obama camp's advertising campaigns will continue relentlessly onwards via the airwaves of the crucial battleground states and help ensure a well-funded \"ground game\" that will get out the vote on election day.</p> <p>Romney's own returns for September are set to be filed to the FEC later Saturday. It is set to be a roughly similar sum though a little lower than Obama's.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/15/romney-raises-170m-debate-boost\">Earlier this week the Romney team indicated</a> it would raise around $170m in September but in conjunction with the Republican National Committee (RNC).</p> <p>The RNC has now released sums showing it hauled in $48m, meaning Romney's campaign would have to directly raise in the region of $122m to hit their stated total.</p> <p>But it is not just parties and candidates that matter in the 2012 election. Outside bodies, known as Super Pacs, are also big players after a loosening of campaign finance regulations.</p> <p>They are controversial because of much less strict laws governing disclosure of<br>donor identities and how much any individual can fork over.</p> <p>The newest figures from the FEC also show the Democrats' main Super Pac brought in a big sum. The pro-Obama group Priorities USA Action said it raised $15.2m in September, compared with $14.8m for the pro-Romney group Restore Our Future, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission.</p> <p>Republicans showed greater fundraising strength at the party level in September.</p> <p>But on a party level the Republicans are doing better. The Democratic National Committee could not compete with the RNC's efforts. The DNC raised $20.3m in September and actually borrowed $10.5m.</p> <p>It ended September $20.5m in debt, according to its filing with the FEC.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>9.30am: It's the day of the leader's speech. I'm in the press room in the concert hall in Perth where Alex Salmond's, Scotland's first minister, will be addressing the SNP this afternoon. It should be the highlight of the four-day conference, but Salmond will be hard pressed to produce anything as dramatic as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/oct/19/snp-conference-nato-debate-live-blog\">yesterday's debate on Nato membership, which culminated in a narrow but significant victory for Salmond and the SNP leadership, who have persuaded the party to drop its historic opposition to an independent Scotland belonging to Nato.</a></p> <p>I will round up more reaction to yesterday's vote shortly.</p> <p>This morning there are two developments worth noting.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-20010209\">Salmond has said that independence would allow the Scots to create \"a more prosperous and a more just society\"</a>. </strong>Normally at party conferences extracts from the leader's speech are released in advance. The SNP have done this, but they've only given us two sentences.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our cause is not and never has been just about a constitutional objective.

Many delegates yesterday voiced their worries over this point. Nato membership would make it harder for an independent Scotland to rid itself of nuclear weapons, warned MSP Jamie Hepburn.</p> <p>German newspaper reports last month suggested that Nato had forced Germany to drop its aspiration to bring about the withdrawal of US nuclear weapons from its soil. Would any negotiation on the point even be possible? The assumption that it would, some opponents believe, is simply \"policy by assertion\". The pro-Union Better Together campaign, which was surely disappointed by yesterday's vote, will seek to exploit such doubts.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.scotsman.com/the-scotsman/opinion/comment/leaders-salmond-wins-nato-battle-but-war-is-still-to-be-won-1-2589611http://www.scotsman.com/the-scotsman/opinion/comment/leaders-salmond-wins-nato-battle-but-war-is-still-to-be-won-1-2589611\">The Scotsman in its leader says the vote represented a major shift in policy</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Opponents, doubtless, will point to the narrowness of the majority and claim nationalists are divided, or to the caveats in the wording eventually approved to contend that the party's new stance is riddled with hypocrisy.

However, in seeking to be so, its negotiators \u2013 step forward the aforesaid Alex Salmond \u2013 would tell the alliance's bigwigs that they'd only continue as a member \"subject to an agreement that Scotland will not host nuclear weapons\".</p> <p>It's called \"conditionality\" but it's actually a virtual negation of what Nato is all about; it is a nuclear alliance and its members accept as part of joining that they enjoy the shelter of what's always been called the \"nuclear umbrella\".</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/scotsol/homepage/news/4599493/Nats-back-Nato.html\">Andrew Nicoll in the Scottish Sun says yesterday's vote makes the SNP look \"a lot more credible\"</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After all, yesterday's conference was packed with diplomatic observers from embassies around the world, watching to see where Scotland is heading.</p> <p>They will be reporting back today having seen a mature party of government in action, a party prepared to lead Scotland to its place on the world stage.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://councillorterrykelly.blogspot.com/2012/10/perth-snp-and-fighters-who-have-now.html\">Terry Kelly, a Labour councillor, says on his blog that the Nato vote marks a defeat for SNP traditionalists</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The vote was very close, close enough in fact to stir talk of mutiny and schisms in most other parties but alas this is the SNP and the truth is that the true nationalists, the genuine independence fighters, have been dying the death of a thousand cuts for 10/15 years now. Today was their last hurrah, they will hang about for some time to come and we will hear the sporadic death rattle but nothing more.</p> <p>Many old timers in the hall and sprinkled around the country will have had tears in their eyes as they stood looking at the triumphant platform and they could not miss surely that the platform was smirking at them. </p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>10.44am: <strong>Fiona Hyslop</strong>, the Scottish culture secretary, is addressing the conference now. The party have released some extracts from her speech. She is saying the SNP believe in subsidising the arts because \"self-expression of the nation needs self-expression of its people\".</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Scotland's culture is our soul - in its traditions, in its innovation, ideas, debates, disputes, its many truths and its many questions. In its democratic intellect it does not just define us, it is constantly challenging and shaping and reshaping our perspective and ideas.</p> <p>Our artists need freedom, respect and support to do so unconditionally because it is in that atmosphere we will see our culture flourish still further.</p> <p>Conference in Scotland, we are seeing world class art, writing and performance being produced. Time and time again I am told from abroad we really value culture for what it is.</p> <p>I have worked hard to protect our cultural institutions and front line grants despite cuts that are too deep and too quick from Westminster. Where the Arts Council in England has seen cuts of 30% Scotland we have sought to protect culture.</p> <p>We believe in public subsidy of art and artists because we believe that self-expression of the nation needs self-expression of its peoples. The experience of one of us can speak to all, and to an audience across the globe.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>11.08am: The conference has passed a motion on welfare describing the UK government's plan to cut housing benefit for the under-25s as \"a shameful attack on young people\" and welcoming the Scottish government's guarantee that \"people will continue to receive the full pension and benefit payments that they are entitled to\" under independence.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>11.15am: Here's another blog about the SNP Nato vote yesterday that's worth reading.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://bothsidesthetweed.wordpress.com/2012/10/19/i-am-a-member-of-the-scottish-national-party/\">Alistair Cassidy on his Both Sides the Tweed blog says that the Nato debate should make people proud to belong to the SNP</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Essentially today the SNP moved from being anti-NATO to being NATO-sceptic. Because of a recognition of the importance of continuity and of mutual co-operation between nations and, in particular the nations of northern Europe NATO has been given a chance, a chance to prove itself as an organisation that can work in the interests of Scotland and of all its members.</p> <p>Be under no illusion that today was a significant day in the life of this party. As Kenny MacAskill put it we have moved from being a party of protest to a party of Government and today's debate exemplified that. Whatever the result had been the real winner today was party democracy and I believe that can be a real example to other political parties, both in Scotland and elsewhere and a sign to the people of Scotland of the kind of government that they should expect post-Independence.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>11.22am: The conference has just passed a motion on the NHS saying the SNP \"rejects all attempts to privatise any services provided by the NHS and congratulates the Scottish government on its commitment to keeping the Scottish NHS in the public sector, in contrast to the NHS in England.\"</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p>11.33am: <strong>Alyn Smith</strong> MEP has just opened a debate on the \"alternative economic model for Scotland that development trusts provide\". He said that if people were unhappy about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/poll/2012/oct/16/taxavoidance-starbucks\">Starbucks not paying much tax in the UK,</a> they should buy coffee from a local shop instead. Business \"rooted in the community\" understood the importance of paying tax, he said.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p>12.09pm:<strong> Jill Evans</strong> MEP, the president of Plaid Cymru, has just finished addressing the conference. She was giving \"fraternal greetings\" on behalf of the Welsh nationalists. An independent Scotland would have not truer friend than Wales, she said.</p> <p>She also pointed out that in Plaid the president, chair, chief executive and leader are all women. I don't think she was trying to have a go at the SNP, but yesterday there were complaints about how few women were speaking in the Nato debate. \"The membership of the SNP is overwhelmingly male\", James Mitchell, Lynn Bennie and Rob Johns concluded <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Scottish-National-Party-Transition-Power/dp/0199580006\">in their study of the SNP published earlier this year.</a></p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p>12.41pm: The cross-party campaign for a yes vote in the independence referendum is called Yes Scotland and it is being run by <strong>Blair Jenkins</strong>, a former head of news at STV and BBC Scotland who is not a member of the SNP, or any other party. He has just addressed the conference. It was an interesting speech, which included a very powerful argument for independence, although one that also undermined his separate argument about the yes campaign being beyond party politics. Here are the main points.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Jenkins said independence campaigners should invite people to consider whether they would vote for union with England if Scotland were already independent.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think if you stand back and look at it, a campaign being run now to persuade Scotland to join the union in my view would be an impossible campaign to run. Just imagine some of the leading propositions, the case that would be put to the Scottish people: your main parliament will move hundreds of miles away, and your MPs will be in a tiny minority; you will get a government you didn't vote for; all your oil and gas revenues will be handed over to the London Treasury. The biggest nuclear weapons arsenal in Western Europe will be build on the River Clyde, 30 miles from your largest city. You will be joining a country where the health and education services are rapidly being privatised.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He claimed that Yes Scotland represented \"a new kind of politics\" because it was non-partisan and non-ideological.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As far as Yes Scotland is concerned, all we ask of anyone is that you support the core principle, the core democratic principle, that the best people to make decisions about the future of Scotland and what is right for Scotland are the who of Scotland themselves \u2026 That is the only price of admission if you like \u2026 This is a cause that transcends political parties and, indeed, is a new kind of politics.</p> </blockquote> <p>Theoretically, then, Yes Scotland is open not just to the SNP, but to people who want an independent Scotland to be an nuclear-armed, low-tax, minimum-regulation state - ie, like Texas, with mountains. But Jenkins undermined this point with his argument about imagining people being asked to vote for union with England (see above) and his claim that independence would allow Scotland to become more equal (see below).</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said independence would allow Scotland to create a more equal society.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br>We know that under successive Labour and Conservatives government, the UK has become one of the most unfair and unequal societies in the western world.

  "<p>New Hampshire is a <a href=\"http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/33000.html\">small state</a>, home to only 1.3 million of the nation's population of 311 million. It's 92.2% white non-Hispanic, compared with 63.4% for the nation as a whole. There is only one major network television affiliate in the state, WMUR. For want of a better phrase, it's almost nothing like the rest of America. And yet the \"live free or die\" state is turning into one of the must-watches on election day. </p> <p>Mitt Romney was behind in almost <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/nh/new_hampshire_romney_vs_obama-2030.html\">every presidential poll</a> that was taken between the New Hampshire primary and mid-September. New Hampshire seemed to be falling back into a Democratic trend in presidential years that had developed over the past few cycles. It was the only state that flipped from the Republican column in 2000 to the Democratic one in 2004. Obama won the state by 9.6 points in 2008, greater than his national 7.3 point victory. But the Granite State had a trick up its sleeve.</p> <p>Romney has led in two polls conducted after the first presidential debate, tied President Obama in another and trailed in a fourth. Overall Romney has held a very slim average one-point edge in polls taken after the first debate with President Obama. </p> <p>Romney's new-found advantage is in some ways not surprising. Republicans romped in the 2010 midterm elections, winning both <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/01/AR2010110105177.html\">House seats</a> a Senate seat and control of both houses of <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/peter-roff/2010/11/05/measuring-the-size-of-election-2010s-republican-sweep\">the state legislature</a>. Romney was also the governor in next door Massachusetts and he has a summer home in New Hampshire. He cruised to an easy 16-point win in the New Hampshire primary and he had been ahead in most polls against Obama before the primary. </p> <p>The sudden Romney rise confirms yet again that this is a state that likes to mess with everyone. It was this electorate that handed pollsters their <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2008/01/the-new-hampshi/\">greatest embarrassment</a> in arguably 60 years when Hillary Clinton defeated Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary, despite all the polls saying otherwise. It's a state where the plurality (45%) of voters <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/polls/#NHP00p1\">self-identify</a> as independent, and Republicans and Democrat split fairly equally the other 55%. </p> <p>You might say, \"Who cares?\" New Hampshire only has four electoral votes. Yet these votes look like they could be quite consequential. A few days ago I <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/16/romney-routes-victory-battleground-states\">mapped out a scenario</a> in which New Hampshire becomes a most important state. </p> <p>Let's say Romney takes Wisconsin along with Colorado, Florida and Virginia, while Obama captures Iowa, Nevada and Ohio. Then New Hampshire decides who will be president.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398106749\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Politics/Pix/pictures/2012/10/19/1350680333288/New-Hampshire-map1-001.jpg\" alt=\"New Hampshire map1\" width=\"460\" height=\"346\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New Hampshire map1 Photograph: Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One other very possible map puts New Hampshire in the limelight as well. This time we'll give Romney Ohio along with Florida and Virginia, while Obama holds Colorado, Iowa, Nevada and Wisconsin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398106750\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Politics/Pix/pictures/2012/10/19/1350680392548/NH-map2-001.jpg\" alt=\"NH map2\" width=\"460\" height=\"344\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">NH map2 Photograph: Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Both of these scenarios requires Romney to win states in which he is seemingly behind, such as Ohio or Wisconsin, which is why Obama remains an electoral-college favorite. Romney's apparent small lead in New Hampshire does help him, though. </p> <p>But New Hampshire's fun doesn't stop at the presidential race. New Hampshire and Vermont are the two remaining states that hold gubernatorial elections every two years. Democratic incumbent governor John Lynch is retiring. Democrat Maggie Hassan and Republican Ovide Lamontagne are facing off in what looks to be one of the <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/governor/nh/new_hampshire_governor_lamontagne_vs_hassan-2804.html\">tightest gubernatorial races</a> in the nation. </p> <p>The same polls that have Romney with an average one-point lead give Lamontagne a 0.8-point edge. Rasmussen has Obama and Lamontagne winning, while Public Policy Polling has Romney and Hassan ahead. It's really that tight. </p> <p>My guess is that the same party is going to win both the gubernatorial and presidential race in New Hampshire. The last time there was both a close <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2004&amp;fips=33&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=0\">gubernatorial</a> and <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2004&amp;fips=33&amp;f=1&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0\">presidential</a> race in the Granite State was 2004. In that year, George Bush and Republican gubernatorial nominee Craig Benson both got 48.87% of the vote, while the vote difference between John Kerry and Democrat John Lynch was 211 out of nearly 700,000 votes cast. </p> <p>New Hampshire's electoral fun doesn't stop in the statewide races, though. Both House of Representative races are rematches of 2010 and are too close to call. </p> <p>New Hampshire 1, the more conservative of the two districts, features incumbent Republican Frank Guinta and former representative Carol Shea-Porter. The Rothenberg Political Report <a href=\"http://rothenbergpoliticalreport.com/ratings/house\">rates the race</a> as \"toss-up/tilt Republican\". Guinta has faced <a href=\"http://www.crewsmostcorrupt.org/mostcorrupt/entry/frank-guinta\">allegations of corruption</a>, while Shea-Porter is probably <a href=\"http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/ratings/house\">too liberal</a> for the district. </p> <p>New Hampshire 2, located in the more rural western part of the state, has incumbent Republican Charlie Bass against Democrat Annie Kuster. The Rothenberg Political Report has the race as \"toss-up/title Democratic\". The moderate Bass will find it tough to survive in a district that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_Partisan_Voting_Index\">leans Democratic</a>, although Kuster's <a href=\"http://www.concordmonitor.com/blogentry/357471/kuster-takes-trackers-camera-says-shell-call-her-opponent?SESS051895268be42074681f2d2bc31d9ece=google\">campaign-trail conduct</a> has probably taken up more press than she would like. </p> <p>Any combination of House winners seem possible. Democrats could win both seats, Republicans could win both seats, Guinta could win but see Bass lose, or Shea-Porter could win with Kuster losing. </p> <p>All told, New Hampshire is a tricky state and nothing really surprises me. When you combine the presidential, gubernatorial and congressional races, I'm not sure there is more exciting state for elections this year. And I didn't even mention that no one really knows who wins either house of the state legislature, either.</p>",
  "<p>As Republican challenger Mitt Romney addressed a throng of supporters in the Virginian town of Leesburg last week, he started to rattle through a list of campaign promises. \"When I become president\" he began. Then he paused and regarded the crowd for a moment before repeating the first word with extra emphasis. \"<em>When</em> I become president, we are finally going to cut spending,\" he said, to shouts of approval.</p> <p>It would have fallen flat just a few weeks ago. The former Massachusetts governor's campaign was emerging from a disastrous summer. It was firmly behind in the polls, had been savaged by an efficient Democrat attack machine and been hit by the release of a secret videotape revealing <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/27/obama-campaign-fresh-attack-romney\" title=\"\">Romney dismissing 47% of Americans </a>as dependent on government. Many observers, including some panicking Republicans, were writing him off as a rightwing version of Michael Dukakis, another former Massachusetts governor, who was soundly beaten by George Bush in 1988.</p> <p>But that was then. In Leesburg, Romney appeared relaxed and confident, cracking jokes and launching attacks against President Barack Obama's economic record. He turned on the charm, too. \"There is so much about this country I love,\" he gushed, before reciting a litany of inspiring anecdotes collected from his many months on the campaign trail. \"We are going to win Virginia, you know that? We are going to win,\" he said.</p> <p>He has grounds for optimism. After Obama's disastrous performance in the first presidential debate \u2013 and Romney's solid, warm showing \u2013 the 2012 election has upended itself. For two weeks a flood of polls has detailed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/08/romney-gains-lead-obama-poll\" title=\"\">a surge in Romney's support</a>. A Gallup tracking survey has him seven points in the lead nationally, beating Obama by 52% to 45%. In the key battlegrounds of Virginia and Florida, Romney is back in the game. He is closing the gap in Wisconsin, which many had seen as out of reach. Even in Pennsylvania, which no one had seen as up for grabs, one recent poll had him ahead. In North Carolina, which narrowly went for Obama in 2008, Romney's team is now so confident of victory that it has started moving out staff and redeploying them to Ohio.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398115699\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/21/1350780966864/US-key-election-battlegro-001.jpg\" alt=\"US key election battlegrounds\" width=\"460\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US key election battlegrounds. Photograph: Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Romney campaign, which all summer seemed on the defensive, is suddenly aggressively on the attack. It is hammering away at the issue of Obama's economic record, ignoring signs of a gradual recovery and instead repeatedly referring to high unemployment, millions of people on food stamps and growing poverty. It is a message that strikes a chord with many people still suffering from the impact of the recession.</p> <p>Certainly in the Leesburg crowd no one was talking about good times being ahead. \"He was a governor of a Democratic state and if he was able to get things done there, then he could get things done anywhere. He should be able to make things happen on a national scale,\" said Diane Senyitko, 52, whose construction business has been hit hard for more than five years of economic turmoil.</p> <p>\"Obama already had his chance. If he was going to bring about a recovery, it would have happened already,\" she said. Indeed, Senyitko is now campaigning for Romney, knocking on doors all over Leesburg and trying to win people over. \"I see a lot of enthusiasm that I did not see before. I don't even think it will be neck and neck at the end. It will be a big win,\" she said.</p> <p>That is probably unlikely. Obama is still \u2013 when all the polls are taken into consideration \u2013 likely to be narrowly ahead. But the race has certainly shifted and the prospect of a Romney win has gone from a poor joke to a perfectly realistic prospect. \"The chances that Romney will win have gotten a lot better,\" said Professor Kevin Leicht, a political expert at the University of Iowa.</p> <p>Now stories of internal dissent within the Romney camp have been replaced with accounts of a \"happy warrior\" candidate, comfortable at the end of an almost six-year quest to get to the White House. Party bigwigs \u2013 once critical of his campaign \u2013 have lined up loyally behind him. So have evangelical leaders, who privately remain sceptical because he is a Mormon. Media critics have fallen silent. Even Karl Rove, President George W. Bush's old guru, has been speculating enthusiastically on Romney's chances of winning the White House back for a party that in 2008 was seen as headed for a lengthy period in the wilderness. Already some have begun to speculate on what that would mean for America and the rest of the world. \"He will run this country like the chief executive of a large corporation,\" said Steven Mitchell, a Republican pollster and founder of Mitchell Research.</p> <p>What you think of that prospect depends on your politics. Liberals would see such a thing as a return to the worst excesses from before the recession. Romney has pledged to deregulate Wall Street again and lower corporate taxes. He preaches the sort of \"trickle down\" economics of the 1980s that Ronald Reagan did, glorifying the wealthy and seeing tax breaks for them as having a broader economic benefit.</p> <p>He wants to scrap Obama's healthcare reforms and take an axe to every part of government, except the military. Liberals fear all this will make America even more unequal, risk another financial meltdown and hurt the lowest levels of society for whom federal help is vital.</p> <p>They also worry Romney will be beholden to the desires of the broader Republican party, especially in Congress, which, stuffed with Tea Party zealots and social conservatives, is far more rightwing than his presidential campaign. They worry the party will force Romney to extremes on everything from monetary policy to abortion, immigration and gay rights. \"They have already influenced Romney in unfavourable ways. The prospects of going back to a pre-2008 environment are very real,\" said Leicht, referring to the extreme stances Romney adopted in order to win his party's nomination.</p> <p>Republicans, obviously, see it differently. They see Romney as unshackling business, sparking broader economic growth and cutting out unnecessary spending that will reduce the deficit. They see Romney rescuing America from the fate of Greece and other heavily indebted European nations. \"There will be a sea change from the current administration. People will invest in things again,\" said Mitchell.</p> <p>It might not be so easy, though. As Obama has found, America's system of government appears designed to end in deadlock. Republican intransigence stymied much of Obama's own domestic agenda. There is little reason to think Romney will fare any better if Democrats still control either part of Congress. Even with \"Obamacare\", Romney might not actually be able to fulfil his party's dreams by scrapping it altogether. \"You can't just repeal it and not replace it with anything,\" said Leicht. Indeed much of Obamacare was based on Romney's own health reforms in Massachusetts. Such \"flip flops\" have long marked his political career and that makes predicting a Romney first term especially difficult: it has never been clear what his core beliefs are. \"In the short term it is going to be hard for him to do very much at all. America's problems are actually too big for either candidate to solve easily,\" Leicht said.</p> <p>Of course there is still a long way to go. Though the Obama campaign has been rocked by the sudden upturn in Romney's fortunes, it remains on top of the race overall. Aside from Gallup, other polls have Obama narrowly ahead or statistically tied at a national level. More important are surveys coming out of the swing states which show Obama still ahead, especially in the midwestern heartland of Ohio.</p> <p>Among all the battlegrounds, it is Ohio that is most important. No Republican has ever won the White House without also winning Ohio and Obama is still solidly ahead there. Obama's operation in the state is huge and well-funded. Both Obama and the first lady have been regular visitors: his entire re-election campaign was launched in the state capital of Columbus. Bill Clinton has been touring the state. Even Bruce Springsteen has been deployed there. If Romney's advance can be stopped in Ohio, the main Democratic campaign argument runs, then it will be halted everywhere. But, essentially, the race for the Oval Office is now on a knife edge.</p> <p>Only a few milestones remain, chief of which is Monday night's third and final debate in Florida. Yet, with its topic of foreign policy, that is unlikely to prove too much of a game-changer given that the electorate's overriding concern is jobs and the economy. \"Honestly, put a gun to my head right now and ask me to pick a winner? I just don't know,\" said Mitchell.</p> <p>But in Leesburg they think they do. Around 8,000 people gathered to hear Romney speak in a park, enjoying the last warm days of autumn. After so much time campaigning and wooing the different camps of his party, Romney appeared to have finally stitched it all together behind him.</p> <p>Take local IT specialist Matthew Russell, 49. He had begun supporting pizza magnate Herman Cain during the party's bitter nomination race, then favoured former House speaker Newt Gingrich. \"Romney was my last choice,\" he confessed. But he was OK with things now, because Romney was offering the one thing that really does unite the party: he might beat Obama. \"If the election was held tomorrow, then I think it would be Obama to win, but if the momentum keeps up this way then I think Romney will eke it out in November,\" he said.</p> <p>If Romney does win, it will not have been pretty. The 2012 election has seen Obama launch one of the most negative campaigns in recent memory claiming Romney is a heartless plutocrat who wants to take America back to the post civil war era satirised by Mark Twain as the Gilded Age. In response, Romney has painted Obama as a dangerous pseudo-socialist taking America on the path to ruin. But if, come 6 November, it is Romney who emerges victorious then neither he nor anyone else in his party will care. In Leesburg, Romney ended his speech with a rousing call to arms. \"We are taking back America,\" he told the crowd. \"America is coming back, we are going to have a real recovery.\"</p> <p>Watching the speech was estate agent Kim Levy, 38. She has been ignoring the polls in favour of a less scientific study of support. The local 7-11 convenience stores have been running a promotion whereby cups of soda feature a picture of Romney or Obama. \"All the Romney cups are gone and all the Obama ones are still there, except maybe one. It's like that at all the 7-11s in Leesburg. All of them,\" she said with undisguised glee.</p>",
  "<p>Four years ago, Seigo Kawaguchi, a high school gym teacher, stayed sitting at a school graduation ceremony when the Japanese national anthem was played. He was not the only one: most other teachers did too, as did more than 150 students and their parents. Most, to be honest, probably sat out of boredom. But some, including Kawaguchi, felt they couldn't ever stand for a song associated with Japan's military past.</p> <p>It was an innocuous event, but within two weeks the incident was reported in a rightwing newspaper and the school was bombarded with calls telling the teachers to \"go back to North Korea\". Kawaguchi was given a written warning, and as a result was inadvertently pushed to the forefront of one of Japan's longest-running and most bizarre legal rows.</p> <p>Since 2003, more than 500 teachers have been disciplined for refusing to stand and sing Kimigayo \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29FFHC2D12Q\" title=\"\">a solemn song</a> about Japan's emperor, which calls for his reign to last \"8,000 generations \u2026 until the pebbles grow into boulders lush with moss\". Standing for it at ceremonies is a requirement in both Tokyo and Osaka.</p> <p>Some teachers have just been given warnings; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/apr/07/worlddispatch.japan\" title=\"\">others effectively sacked</a>. Appeals have <a href=\"http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T120117005934.htm\" title=\"\">reached the country's supreme court twice</a>, but new cases keep coming. On Thursday morning Kawaguchi went to a high court in Osaka to try and get his warning overturned, saying the requirement restricts his freedom of thought. He lost. He'll now take his challenge to the supreme court.</p> <p>The issue may seem minor, but the fact that teachers are being asked to stand and sing an anthem at all is a worrying sign of Japan's continued conservatism and desire to please nationalists. There are few other developed countries that have regulations requiring people to stand and sing, and none others that actually enforce the requirement like Japan does.</p> <p>In Russia, some schools require daily singing from pupils, others don't. Even the US \u2013 that most patriotic of countries \u2013 does not discipline people failing to stand for the anthem. Its \"flag code\" says people \"should\" stand when the anthem's played, hand on heart, facing the flag. But you are free to not bother \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/mitt-romneys-misfire-on-the-national-anthem/2012/02/05/gIQA5NLKsQ_blog.html\" title=\"\">unless of course you're running for office</a>.</p> <p>It seems a somewhat basic requirement of any country that respects free speech to not force an anthem on someone; to realise these are historical songs that can either be taken by individuals as a vital source of inspiration or a joke. Should France force anyone from an immigrant background to sing the Marseillaise with its chorus calling on soldiers to water the fields with \"impure blood\"? Should the UK government be forcing schoolchildren to sing God Save the Queen?</p> <p>Unfortunately, it does not seem as though Japan is going to come to that realisation anytime soon. If anything, things are only going to get worse, and largely due to the rise of Osaka's mayor Toru Hashimoto. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/17/toru-hashimoto-tipped-future-japan-leader\" title=\"\">young turk of Japanese politics</a>, who leads the Japan Restoration Association party, is expected to win a large number of seats at this year's elections, and he's one of the strongest advocates of forcing people to stand and sing. Last autumn, he supported a bill introduced in Osaka that would allow schools to sack teachers if they refused to stand three times. He's even endorsed headmasters watching teachers' lips to check if they're singing.</p> <p>Hashimoto's policies are ultimately aimed at restoring Japan to a world economic force. But culturally, how is stifling individualism and forcing people to sing a sad, one-minute-long tune going to achieve that? It's hardly the fresh break Japan needs. Hashimoto's office would not comment on Kawaguchi's case when contacted, but simply said the mayor endorses regulations \"designed to encourage respect for the traditions and culture of Japan\". I thought a tradition of Japanese people was they were highly respectful of others' views, but I guess I'm wrong.</p>",

Instead we have been mired in a double dip recession.They told us if we only accepted the cuts, our deficit would come down. Instead our borrowing is going through the roof.The biggest lie of them all was the cynical double talk that we are all in this together. The grim reality has been tax cuts for the richest with wage and benefit cuts for the poorest.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cPeople are already borrowing hundreds of pounds to get by each month. We know - and the government knows full well - that millions of low waged workers are just about keeping their heads above water. Yet this Government is going to crush their last vestiges of hope by attacking housing and income help. The poverty that will follow will engulf our communities for generations to come.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Christine Blower, leader of the National Union of Teachers, said the march will send a message to the coalition that its austerity measures were not working, adding:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cThe brutal cuts that have been made to the public sector alongside the attacks on education and the health service have gone too far.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Paul Kenny, general secretary of the GMB, said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cThere will be huge turnouts at the mass demonstrations in London, Glasgow and Belfast for a future that works.That there is mass unemployment, in the sixth year of recession, shows that the Tories and Liberals are following the wrong economic policies.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union leader Mark Serwotka will call for co-ordinated strikes to be held as soon as possible after today\u2019s protest.\u201d</p> <p>Matt Wrack, General Secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, will urge the public to join fire-fighters in defending stations threatened with closure, including some in London under spending cuts.</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cThe public has already lost around 1,500 frontline fire-fighters since 2010, despite David Cameron\u2019s hollow eve-of-election promise that there would be no cuts to the fire fighting frontline. If the Government\u2019s reckless austerity drive continues, we could see frontline fire-fighter jobs slashed by 20% since David Cameron made his empty meaningless pledge. People deserve to have their lives, homes and businesses protected. As fire-fighters, we have a duty to spell out to the public the risks of ever - deepening cuts. More cuts will mean slower response times to emergencies, putting lives, homes and businesses at greater risk. Response times are almost two minutes slower on average than a decade ago.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-20T12:38:09.575Z\">at 1.38pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-508271b858f96784ee2907ac\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-20T09:41:12.503Z\">10.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Miliband is expected to tell the rally that whoever was in government now would have to make some cuts.</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cI do not promise easy times.

You do it by building one nation.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Miliband will attack the coalition for stating that austerity would help the economy grow.</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cOur economy has not grown. It has flatlined. They told us \u2018we\u2019re all in this together\u2019. But now they are cutting taxes for millionaires, as they raise taxes on everybody else, including our pensioners. They told us the gain would be worth the pain. But even after the cuts, the pain, the tax rises, borrowing is not falling - it\u2019s rising.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>A government spokesman said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cWe understand that these are challenging economic and financial times and that many people are finding things difficult. However, we cannot flinch from making the tough decisions needed to get public finances back on track. We are doing everything we can to get the economy growing again. But this can\u2019t be done without tackling the deficit.</p> <p>\u201cIt is disappointing that some unions insist on pushing for irresponsible and futile strike action which benefits no one. As we have said time and again, pension talks will not be reopened and nothing further will be achieved through strike action.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Grant Shapps, Conservative Party Chairman, said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cAt today\u2019s march, Ed Miliband will be among friends - supporting his union donors who oppose every single one of our spending cuts.You can\u2019t be serious about clearing the deficit when you attend a march that calls for an end to austerity.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-20T12:40:01.066Z\">at 1.40pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5082707cc0e343ef1abc7d2f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-20T09:35:56.307Z\">10.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Labour leader Ed Miliband is among speakers due to address crowds in Hyde Park where the march ends.

  "<p>On 29 May 2012, the New York Times published a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;\">remarkable 6,000-word story</a> on its front page about what it termed President Obama's \"kill list\". It detailed the president's personal role in deciding which individuals will end up being targeted for assassination by the CIA based on Obama's secret, unchecked decree that they are \"terrorists\" and deserve to die. </p> <p>Based on interviews with \"three dozen of his current and former advisers\", the Times' Jo Becker and Scott Shane provided extraordinary detail about Obama's actions, including how he \"por[es] over terrorist suspects' biographies on what one official calls the macabre 'baseball cards'\" and how he \"insist[s] on approving every new name on an expanding 'kill list'\". At a weekly White House meeting dubbed \"Terror Tuesdays\", Obama then decides who will die without a whiff of due process, transparency or oversight. It was this process that resulted in the death of US citizen Anwar Awlaki in Yemen, and then two weeks later, the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-airstrike-that-killed-american-teen-in-yemen-raises-legal-ethical-questions/2011/10/20/gIQAdvUY7L_story.html\">killing of his 16-year-old American son, Abdulrahman, by drone</a>.</p> <p>The Times \"kill list\" story made a huge impact and was <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/obamas-kill-list-is-unchecked-presidential-power/2012/06/11/gJQAHw05WV_story.html\">widely discussed</a> and <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gregorymcneal/2012/06/08/obama-kill-list-leaks/\">condemned</a> by media figures, politicians, <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/06/obama-kill-list-assassinations-election\">analysts</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/blogs/national-affairs/jon-stewart-on-obamas-kill-list-20120614\">commentators</a>. Among other outlets, the New York Times itself <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/31/opinion/too-much-power-for-a-president.html\">harshly editorialized</a> against Obama's program in an editorial entitled \"Too Much Power For a President\", denouncing the revelations as \"very troubling\" and argued: \"No one in that position should be able to unilaterally order the killing of American citizens or foreigners located far from a battlefield - depriving Americans of their due-process rights - without the consent of someone outside his political inner circle.\" </p> <p>That Obama has a \"kill list\" has been known since January, 2010, and has been <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/world/middleeast/07yemen.html?hp\">widely reported</a> and <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/06/AR2010040604121.html?hpid=topnews\">discussed</a> in every major American newspaper since April 2010. A major controversy over chronic White House leaks often <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/us/politics/senators-want-inquiry-on-national-security-leaks.html\">featured complaints about this article</a> (New York Times, 5 June 2012: \"Senators to Open Inquiry Into 'Kill List' and Iran Security Leaks\"). The Attorney General, Eric Holder, <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/03/05/holder-defends-killings-american-citizens-overseas-in-war-on-terrorism/\">gave a major speech</a> defending it.</p> <p>But Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Democratic Congresswoman from Florida and the Chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, does not know about any of this. She has never heard of any of it. She has managed to remain completely ignorant about the fact that President Obama has asserted and exercised the power to secretly place human beings, including US citizens, on his \"kill list\" and then order the CIA to extinguish their lives. </p> <p>Just marvel at this stunning, completely inexcusable two-minute display of wholesale ignorance by this elected official and DNC chair. Here she is after the second presidential debate being asked by Luke Rudkowski of We Are Change about the \"kill list\" and whether Romney should be trusted with this power. She doesn't defend the \"kill list\". She doesn't criticize it. She makes clear that she has never heard of it and then contemptuously treats Rudkowski like he is some sort of frivolous joke for thinking that it is real:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zFh0nIYNAyY?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zFh0nIYNAyY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Anyone who observes politics closely has a very low bar of expectations. It's almost inevitable to become cynical - even jaded - about just how inept and inane top Washington officials are. Still, even processing this through those lowly standards, I just find this staggering. Staggering and repellent. This is an elected official in Congress, the body that the Constitution designed to impose checks on the president's abuses of power, and she does not have the foggiest idea what is happening in the White House, and obviously does not care in the slightest, because the person doing it is part of the party she leads.</p> <p>One expects corrupt partisan loyalty from people like Wasserman Schultz, eager to excuse anything and everything a Democratic president does. That's a total abdication of her duty as a member of Congress, but that's par for the course. But one does not expect this level of ignorance, the ability to stay entirely unaware of one of the most extremist powers a president has claimed in US history, trumpeted on the front-page of the New York Times and virtually everywhere else.</p>"
