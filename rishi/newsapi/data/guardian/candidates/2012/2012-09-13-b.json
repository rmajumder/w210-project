  "<p>US campaign finance rules, which have allowed wealthy individuals to pour millions of dollars into the 2012 presidential election, have shaken public confidence in the political process, according to a report by the Global Commission on Elections, Democracy and Security.</p> <p>The commission, which is headed by former UN secretary general Kofi Annan, and comprises former world leaders and Nobel prize winners, has identified a rise in \"uncontrolled, undisclosed, illegal and opaque\" political finance across the world as a key threat to electoral integrity, in a new report due to be launched in the UK on Friday.</p> <p>The report singles out the US as an example of a country where lack of transparency and controls in political finance have left it struggling to restore the public's confidence in its elected officials to act in their interest.</p> <p>The commission blamed a series of court decisions \u2013 in particular the controversial Citizens United ruling, which turned campaign finance reform on its head and spawned Super Pacs, effectively removing barriers to corporate and union spending to influence elections </p> <p>Citizens United has \"undermined political equality, weakened transparency of the electoral process and shaken citizen confidence in America's political institutions and elections\", the report said.</p> <p>It also criticises US states which have sought to introduce voter identification laws and other measures that have the effect of suppressing African American participation in the political process.</p> <p>Vidar Helgessen, secretary general of International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, said that US system was cited as just one example of flaws in democracies worldwide. But, he said the US, as the most powerful nation in the world, had a responsibility to set an example.</p> <p>\"If a vast majority of citizens say the systems is undermining political equality and weakening transparency of the electoral process, then there is an issue of trust in the government,\" he said.</p> <p>Political finance was an important issue which had not received the attention and reform it deserved, he said.</p> <p>\"We are seeing increasing inequality and we are in a global economic recession and it is an issue that will only grow. It is not only in new and emerging democracies that provide challenges and have elections that lack integrity\"</p> <p>The report cited a national survey this year by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University law school, <a href=\"http://www.brennancenter.org/content/resource/national_survey_super_pacs_corruption_and_democracy/\">which found a majority of people</a> believe nominally independent Super Pacs to be a danger to democracy. </p> <p>\"Nearly two-thirds of Americans said that they trust government less because big donors have more influence over election officials than average Americans,\" the report said.</p> <p>It concluded that, although Super Pacs must disclose their contributors and may not coordinate directly with candidates by law, in practice, \"both constraints have been flouted\".</p> <p>It compared the US unfavourably to Canada, which has faced many of the same campaign finance struggles and concludes: \"In contrast to the USA, Canada has managed to strike a balance between safeguarding individuals speech and protecting the overall integrity of the electoral process.\"</p> <p>It argued that the rise of \"uncontrolled political finance\" was one of five major threats to democracy, which could rob it of its unique strengths to promote political equality, the empowerment of the disenfranchised and the ability to manage societal conflicts peacefully.</p> <p>The report looked at a host of problems, including post-election violence in places such as Kenya and Nigeria, illicit finance in Costa Rica, and disenfranchised populations in Europe.</p>",
  "<p><em>[Updated below - Update II (Fri.)]</em></p> <p>Vanity Fair just published <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2012/10/michael-lewis-profile-barack-obama\">a lengthy profile of Barack Obama</a> by Michael Lewis, a profile he was able to write by \"hanging around Barack Obama for six months, in the White House, aboard Air Force One, and on the basketball court\". How did Lewis get such extensive, unfettered access to the President? In large part, it was by agreeing that he would give the White House full veto power over any quotes he wanted to include, as <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/09/12/161003362/michael-lewis-studies-obamas-way\">he told NPR today</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>\"'My whole goal was to create a very natural environment so I could observe him without lots of people worrying about how it was going to be made to look in print.<em> So the agreement I had with him was, 'Don't worry about me. I don't mind you vetting his quotes, and if you set me up with an interview with someone else in the White House and I want to quote that person, I'll show you those quotes, too', and that ended up happening</em>. . . .</p> <p>\"So I sent those in, and they did almost nothing to them. Very, very little. . . .\"</p> </blockquote> <p>It's understandable that the White House exercised the quote-approval power he gave them \"very, very little,\" because most of the profile is filled with admiration, fluff, and awe. That's hardly surprising given this incredibly revealing passage, in which Lewis -- who is pictured at the top of the article strolling with the President as they both smile at each other -- watches Obama play basketball against younger men and then speaks afterward to one of those players [my emphasis]:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"No one held back, no one deferred. Guys on [Obama's] team dribbled past him and ignored the fact he was wide open. . . .</p> <p>\"'No one seems to be taking it easy on [Obama],' I said.</p> <p>'If you take it easy on him, you're not invited back,' he explained.</p> <p><em>I thought to myself, It must be hard not to take it easy on the president</em>.</p> </blockquote> <p>In an act of glaring and extreme projection, Lewis purports to imagine what it's like to play basketball with the president but is obviously revealing his own thoughts: it's \"hard not to take it easy on the president\", he writes. That is more or less the motto of modern American journalism.</p> <p>That's not to say that there are no revealing passages. Lewis writes that when Obama learned he won the Nobel Peace Prize, he spoke to his speechwriters and \"told them he intended to use the acceptance speech to make the case for war\". And Lewis wrote, presumably channeling Obama, that \"the Nobel Prize Committee had just made it a tiny bit harder for him to do the job he'd just been elected to do, as he could not at once be commander in chief of the most powerful force on earth and the face of pacifism\". </p> <p>But those were obviously facts the White House wanted the public to hear in the months leading up to the election. In fact, one can say the same about every quote in Lewis' article, since, by virtue of the terms Lewis agreed to, none could appear unless the White House gave explicit permission. Whatever that arrangement is, it is not journalism (as some media outlets are <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/23/us/politics/national-journal-bars-quotations-tweaked-by-sources.html\">now acknowledging</a>). It's more akin to what someone would set out to do when they believe that \"it must be hard not to take it easy on the president\".</p> <p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: George Orwell <a href=\"http://quotevadis.com/post/25110952622/george-orwell-everything-else-is-pr\">famously wrote</a>: \"Journalism is printing what someone else does not want printed: everything else is public relations\". If a writer in advance promises the subject of their profile that nothing will be revealed except that which they explicitly approve, then it's not exactly difficult to determine in which of these two endeavors that writer is engaged.</p> <p><strong>UPDATE II (Fri.)</strong>: Several commenters have responded that there's nothing \"surprising\" about this quote-approval practice because it has been a common practice for so long. Leaving aside the fact that I never said or suggested there was anything \"surprising\" about any of this, there are several brief points worth making in response:</p> <p><strong>(1)</strong> Whether certain conduct is \"surprising\" is totally irrelevant to whether it is worthy of condemnation. That Behavior X is common (and therefore \"unsurprising\") does not remotely negate the view that Behavior X is wrong and destructive; the former point is a non sequitur to the latter. Indeed, this mentality -- that once a certain practice becomes common it no longer merits real condemnation -- is itself quite harmful, for reasons I <a href=\"http://ggsidedocs.blogspot.com.br/2012/09/cynicism-as-enabling-force-for-power.html\">set forth recently here</a>.</p> <p><strong>(2)</strong> The New York Times apparently did not believe that this practice was so common and long-standing as to be worthy of being overlooked, giving that, just two months ago, they published a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/16/us/politics/latest-word-on-the-campaign-trail-i-take-it-back.html?pagewanted=all\">long article blowing the whistle</a> on these quote-approval arrangements, ones offered to Obama campaign officials by several news outlets including the Times itself. That Times article prompted widespread discussion among media professionals, journalism professors, and media critics precisely because it was not very well known that this practice had become anywhere near this pervasive.</p> <p><strong>(3)</strong> There are many news outlets that clearly do not take such a dismissive stance toward this quote-approval practice because -- both before that Times article and since -- they prohibit their reporters from entering into such arrangements on the grounds that such agreements are journalistically corrupt. That includes <a href=\"http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/181346/ap-doesnt-let-sources-approve-quotes-beforehand/\">Associated Press</a>, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/23/national-journal-bans-quote-approval_n_1694434.html\">National Journal</a>, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/07/mcclatchy-joins-quoteapproval-opposition-129624.html\">McClatchy</a> and others.</p> <p><strong>(4)</strong> The excuse journalists use here is the same one they use to justify the indiscriminate granting of anonymity: <em>we have to do this, or they won't talk to us, and it's better to get corrupted access than none at all</em>. I think the opposite is true: it's better to have no access than corrupted access, as there really is nothing worse for a journalist than to serve eagerly as a P.R. stenographer for a politician. </p> <p>But even if this excuse were convincing, its premise is factually inaccurate. Politicians need media to cover them and convey their messages. If journalists stopped offering politicians corrupt arrangements -- quote-approval power and the ability to hide behind anonymity for no good reason -- then politicians would be trained to know that such arrangements would not be available to them and would stop expecting them. These excuses are nothing more than attempts to wrap what is plainly careerist, access-desperate, subservient behavior into a pretty package of noble journalistic justification (<em>we're just doing this, as distasteful as we find it, in order to keep our readers informed</em>). </p> <p>No readers are being \"informed\" by the publication of a profile in which the subject of the profile has the power to decide what does and does not get printed. They're being propagandized.</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 A break is as good as a rest, they say, and with his workload, business magnate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/aug/19/philip-green-liberal-democrats-tax\" title=\"\">Sir Philip Green</a> is entitled to a bit of rest and recuperation. Away from the boardroom hurly-burly. Away from all that controversy about the tax he did or didn't pay. The Greek isle of Skiathos seemed just the ticket for the multimillionaire. But how to get away from it all, in this day and age? Practically impossible. And so it was that pretty quickly, he and his yacht were <a href=\"http://ukuncut.org.uk/blog/guest-post-holiday-activism\" title=\"\">spotted by two activists from the group UK&#xa0;Uncut</a>. First, according to their account, they confronted him personally. Alas, the conversation they hoped for did not ensue. Then they commandeered the necessary materials and a marker pen to create bright placards bearing slogans about Sir Philip&#xa0;and his tax responsibilities \u2013 material too libellous to repeat here. It all became quite a spectacle. The mayor turned up to plead for the resumption of calm. Then the police. The next day, when the protesting pair returned, Sir Philip and his yacht had gone. Over the horizon, away from the hubbub. Destination: peace and quiet.</p> <p>\u2022 Fury over the Hillsborough revelations continues unabated, with Sir Norman Bettison, who was part of the South Yorkshire police inquiry, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/13/hillsborough-report-norman-bettison-refuses-resign\" title=\"\">refusing to quit as chief constable of West Yorkshire</a>. Most unedifying. No one would willingly change places with him. That's why at Scotland Yard they're ready for any collateral damage. The commissioner, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/bernard-hogan-howe\" title=\"\">Bernard Hogan-Howe</a>, was indeed at South Yorkshire, his people say quick as a flash, but over the relevant period he was away on study leave. Scouts, top cops. Pays in both cases to be prepared.</p> <p>\u2022 Gloom threatens at the end of our glorious summer of sport. So here's something to cheer us up. It's all about an official called Katherine Kerswell, who received a \u00a3420,000 payoff in June when she left the chief executive's job at Kent county council. Her salary there was \u00a3197,000, but Kent's a go-ahead place, and they have decided they don't need a chief executive. Still, talent will out, again and again. And so, excellent to record that Kerswell has now been appointed director-general for civil service reform in the Cabinet Office, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2012/sep/12/katherine-kerswell-lead-civil-service-reform?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">where she will work alongside the head of the civil service, Sir Bob Kerslake</a>. Salary there, \u00a3142,000. The Local Government Chronicle points out that, as chief officer in Northamptonshire, she urged underlings to think of their organisation as \"strawberry flavoured\". Just the sort of insight the civil service needs.</p> <p>\u2022 More on those wayward sorts at Ukip. They're up in arms over Liberal Democrat accusations that they are the no-show lead-swingers of the European parliament. Not so, says Ukip. We are diligent. We do show up to meetings. But that may not be such a good thing, because once there, they just can't help behaving badly. Godders \"Eight pints\" Bloom was exiled for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/24/ukip-mep-ejected-godfrey-bloom\" title=\"\">hurling a Nazi jibe</a>, and the leader, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/25/nigel-farage-herman-van-rompuy-damp-rag\" title=\"\">Nigel Farage, famously went verbal at EU president Herman Van Rompuy</a>, accusing him of having \"all the charisma of a damp rag and the appearance of a low-grade bank clerk\". Farage was fined \u00a32,700, and has since been fighting this miscarriage of justice. But we note that his latest appeal has now been brushed aside. Shocking, really. He should hire Michael Mansfield.</p> <p>\u2022 Finally, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/13/hugh-muir-diary-boris-johnson?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">we mentioned Stephen Gilbert</a>, the Liberal Democrat MP for St Austell &amp; Newquay, who said he was the only MP at the last election still living with his parents. That's nothing, <a href=\"http://www.theyworkforyou.com/peer/lord%20avebury?keyword=lord%20avebury&amp;creativeid=6817068303&amp;gclid=CKWN17r1srICFYcKfAodi1wA3g\" title=\"\">says the Liberal Democrat peer&#xa0;Lord Avebury</a>. As&#xa0;Eric Lubbock, MP&#xa0;for Orpington, said, he and his wife and three children lived with his mother for&#xa0;seven years. \"It was all I could afford,\" he says. \"My MP's pay was \u00a31,750, and my secretary was paid \u00a3750. That left \u00a31,000 for two adults and&#xa0;three children.\" His mother was kindness itself, facilitating a long and fruitful career. For all that, it wasn't easy. \"She didn't like the way my children behaved, especially when my son, now 55, lit a fire in the basement. He was a bit of an arsonist, but then he was born on November 5th,&#xa0;and one of his names is Guy.\" It was&#xa0;only to be expected.</p> <p><em> Twitter: </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/hugh_muir\" title=\"\"><em>@hugh_muir</em></a></p>",
  "<p>On Thursday, America's top central banker and easily the most important unelected official in the world did something big and bold \u2013 and really rather worrying. Ben Bernanke announced <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120913a.htm\" title=\"\">he and his colleagues would buy $40bn (\u00a325bn) of mortgage-backed bonds every month</a> \u2013 for as long it took to turn the economy around. This was a huge step both financially and in terms of policy.</p> <p>The money speaks for itself: by the time of the next presidential inauguration address in January 2013, the central bank will have pumped well over $100bn into the economy. But that explicit tethering of a policy with economic outcomes is even more interesting: it's a first for the Fed and makes this one of the most important central bank interventions since the financial crisis began. Predictably enough, markets lapped up the decision, with the Dow Jones industrial average soaring on the news. It will surely be greeted with a sigh of relief within Barack Obama's White House, too; even while Mitt Romney's outriders take potshots at the Fed boss for, supposedly, trying to get out of a debt crisis by taking on more debt \u2013 and being too cavalier with inflation.</p> <p>We'll return to the politics of this latest blitz by the Fed, just two months before a presidential election, in a minute. But first let it be said, whatever the merits of this latest policy, it would not have been rustled up unless the US economy was in the doldrums. That is not journalistic conjecture; it is the view of Mr Bernanke himself.</p> <p>Just a couple of weeks ago, <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20120831a.htm\" title=\"\">he addressed the annual gathering of fellow central bankers at Jackson Hole</a>, Wyoming, and told them that America's economic health was \"far from satisfactory\" and talked in particular of \"the stagnation of the labour market\" as \"a grave concern\". None of this is controversial: three years after America was officially declared out of recession, over 8% of the workforce remains out of a job. Companies aren't firing, but they sure aren't hiring, either. Growth too remains very disappointing. The western economies can be divided between those acutely ill (see Greece) and those chronically ill: America falls squarely in the latter camp. And Thursday's application of jump leads to the stalling economy belies the optimism of some who swear a startling recovery is just around the corner.</p> <p>Whether <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/13/ben-bernanke-rescues-us-economy-nihilism-right\" title=\"\">Ben Bernanke</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/06/mario-draghi-stand-deliver-editorial\" title=\"\">Mario Draghi</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/18/mervyn-king-save-british-economy\" title=\"\">Mervyn King</a>, central bankers are being leant on by governments unwilling or unable to do their bit to boost the economy \u2013 either by spending more or by rethinking policy. That gives them a worrying prominence for unaccountable officials \u2013 but also means they become flak-catchers in political debates. That's probably an apt a description as any of the relationship between Mr Bernanke and the US president.</p>",
  "<p>How did Mitt Romney first find out about the 9/11 attacks? <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/romneys-has-given-two-version-of-his-911-experie\">As Buzzfeed notes</a>, he's told two versions of this tale: in one, he's giving a radio interview when a host interrupts to tell him the news; in the other, someone rushes into his office to inform him. Just to be explicit: this really doesn't matter very much. As with so much about Willard, it's a little weird, since most people can remember exactly where they were. (I was at my desk in London, researching an article about Bob the Builder, since you asked.) But as an example of his complicated relationship with the truth, it was minor, and quickly dwarfed by his campaign's <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/09/12/romneys-political-pretzel-over-libya/comment-page-3/\">attempt to argue</a> that a statement issued by the US embassy in Cairo, prior to yesterday's violence, was actually a response to it. </p> <p>Still, the 9/11 discrepancy helped clarify something I'd been finding especially aggravating about this election campaign so far. We've heard much talk about truth and lies and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/23/opinion/krugman-the-post-truth-campaign.html\">the \"post-truth campaign\"</a>, fuelled by the controversial role of fact-checking operations like <a href=\"http://politifact.com/\">Politifact</a> and <a href=\"http://factcheck.org/\">FactCheck.org</a>. (Here on CiF, last week, Bob Garfield argued that the Republicans are increasingly taking refuge in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/05/paul-ryan-middling-mendacity-media\">the \"medium lie\"</a>, too inconsequential to cause a fuss.) But something's missing from this conversation. What this campaign has been especially full of, so far, is <em>bullshit</em>. </p> <p>In his 2005 bestseller, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Bullshit\">On Bullshit</a>, the Princeton philosopher Harry Frankfurt made a crucial distinction between lies and bullshit. To lie is to intentionally deceive, by saying what you know (or believe) isn't the truth. Romney <a href=\"http://maddowblog.msnbc.com/_news/2012/09/07/13731433-chronicling-mitts-mendacity-vol-xxxiii?lite\">does this all the time</a>. To bullshit, though, is to talk without regard for the truth, one way or the other. The liar and the truth-teller, writes Frankfurt, \"are playing on opposite sides, so to speak, in the same game\"; the bullshitter, by contrast, refuses to play. \"He does not reject the authority of the truth, as the liar does, and oppose himself to it. He pays no attention to it at all.\"</p> <p>Frankfurt has much more to say \u2013 I'm shamelessly ripping his concept out of its context here \u2013 but applying it to recent pronouncements is illuminating. Does anyone really believe, for instance, that Romney has a sinister reason for telling two stories about 9/11? Or that Paul Ryan decided to tell a calculated lie about <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/09/02/paul_ryans_marathon_lie/\">his marathon times</a>? Or that he was consciously telling the truth or lying about his mysterious mountaineering record, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/09/finale-on-paul-ryan-as-mountain-climber/262054/\">pored over by James Fallows</a>? Or that Romney was lying, in the Frankfurtian sense, when he denied having seen Super Pac ads made in support of him, <a href=\"http://2012.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/01/mitt-romneys-rapid-fire-flip-flop-on-whether-or-not-hes-seen-his-super-pacs-ads-video.php\">then said he'd seen them</a>? Or, to disinter an old classic, when he idly spoke of having been a hunter all his life,<a href=\"http://www.sltrib.com/ci_5592560\"> but turned out not to have been</a>? Is it because of \"lies\" that we'll never know whether Seamus the Roofrack Dog, of celebrated legend, was in <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2012/01/13/romneys-dog-on-car-roof-story-makes-him-unfit-to-be-president/\">\"an air-tight container\", or that his excrement spilled down the side of the car</a>, both of which presumably couldn't be true at the same time? (Also: who even thinks about putting a dog in an air-tight container?)</p> <p>Of course not. These incidents all involve candidates emitting words from their mouths, in roughly grammatical order, to sound plausible, as circumstances demand. These statements aren't the truth, nor a deliberate attempt to evade the truth. They're pure bullshit.</p> <p>And there is a reason why most of those examples involve \"soft\" questions about the candidates' hobbies and biographies, by the way: that's when bullshit's easiest to spot (smell?). On more important topics, it's harder to distinguish bullshitting from lying, because it's difficult to imagine that someone running for the presidency or vice-presidency of the United States might really make nakedly untrue claims about his <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/07/mitt-romney/romney-says-his-health-care-bill-affected-far-smal/\">opponent's healthcare policies</a>, or about <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2012/03/more-twaddle-twit\">major episodes in American history</a>, out of anything other than coldly calculated intent. </p> <p>But I wonder. Through \"excessive indulgence\" in bullshitting, Frankfurt writes, \"a person's normal habit of attending to the ways things are may become attenuated or lost\". Bullshitting breeds bullshitting. And ultimately, that's worse than lying, Frankfurt argues: at least liars remain in <em>some</em> kind of relationship with the truth. </p> <p>And so the politicians with integrity keep telling the truth, the liars keep lying, the fact-checking operations keep adjudicating between them, and the pundits keep worrying about lies. But none of this troubles the bullshitter, who exists in another dimension entirely, bullshitting happily away. You think he cares about adhering to the truth, or carefully concealing his divergence from it? Bullshit.</p>",
  "<p>After months of deadlock and four days of strike action, Chicago teachers appeared on Thursday to be close to a deal with City Hall which would have children back to school by the beginning of next week.</p> <p>Tuesday's deadlock appears to have been broken after Chicago Public Schools officials offered a revised contract, conceding several key points regarding teacher evaluations.</p> <p>Union negotiators who claimed on Tuesday that CPS claims of being close to a deal were \"lunacy\" left talks on Wednesday night very upbeat. Asked to use a scale of one to 10 regarding the chances of a deal being reached on Thursday, Chicago Teachers Union president Karen Lewis said: \"I'm a nine.\"</p> <p>The offer came on the day a poll revealed that 47% of Chicagoans backed the teachers against 39% who backed mayor Rahm Emanuel, whom three quarters of the city believed was doing an average, below average or poor job of handling the dispute.</p> <p>\"We're hoping we can tighten up some of the things we talked about yesterday... and get this thing done,\" Lewis told reporters.</p> <p>Barbara Byrd-Bennett, chief education officer with CPS, was also confident, claiming children could be in school as early as Friday. \"I can really, really say to you, if we stick to the issues, unless something really nutsy happens, kids can be back in school [tomorrow].\"</p> <p>The union, though, was keen to damp down expectations of a return at the end of the week since any deal would have to be overseen by lawyers and then ratified by the union's house of delegates, which is scheduled to meet on Friday.</p> <p>The new proposals soften the CPS push for evaluations based on testing, offers the opportunity for appeals and prevents the CPS from reneging on previous salary agreements in times of economic crisis, as it did last year. Quite what has been settled on the thorny issue of rehiring is not yet known.</p> <p>The CPS has just finished a round of school closures \u2013 concentrated in black and Latino areas \u2013 and is about to embark on another. </p> <p>The CTU demands that any new hiring comes from the pool of teachers who have been laid off. The CPS has insisted that principals must have the right to hire who they want and as of Tuesday morning had assured only that laid-off teachers be guaranteed an interview. </p> <p>It is difficult to know what prompted the CPS to shift its position. It is possible that, as school board representatives stated at the beginning of the week, the two sides were very close, even if the union did not know it. </p> <p>It is also possible that local political considerations kicked in once it was clear that most Chicagoans blamed the mayor for the situation and that the teachers showed little sign of backing down. </p> <p>Insiders say the atmosphere in the negotiations on Monday and Tuesday was becoming toxic and the makeshift arrangements cobbled together for and by parents were showing some strain.</p> <p>National political considerations may also have been a factor, with Democratic officials anxious to thwart a conflict between unions and the party in the president's home town a couple of months before the presidential election.</p> <p>But something changed. After all, on Wednesday night CPS supporters were still screening anti-strike ads on local television, even as a deal was being hammered out, and Thursday morning's headlines quoted Lewis saying the two sides were \"not inches but kilometres apart\".</p> <p>On Thursday, when asked about the prospect of students going back on Monday, Lewis said: \"I'm praying, praying, praying. I'm on my knees for that.\"</p>",
  "<p>Last month, at the Federal Reserve's Jackson Hole conference, Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke told the audience:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The stagnation of the labor market is a grave concern not only because of the enormous suffering and waste of human talent it entails, but also because persistently high levels of unemployment will wreak structural damage on our economy that could last for many years.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>This week, Bernanke assumed the obligation of those words as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/13/fed-bond-buying-stimulus-growth\">Fed announced Thursday that it will engage in another round of quantitative easing \u2013 the so-called QE3</a> \u2013 through open-ended purchases of $40bn of mortgage debt per month. Furthermore, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) declared its intent to hold the federal funds rate \u2013 the interest rate that the Fed directly controls \u2013 near zero \"at least through mid-2015\".</p> <p>The FOMC went on to say that \"a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens.\" This was as bold a statement for loose monetary policy to support the economy as anyone could have hoped for.</p> <p>Before last week, Fed watchers had predicted that Bernanke would wait until December or early 2013 to launch a new round. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/13/federal-reserve-qe3-quantitative-easing\">Some had charged that to act earlier placed the Fed's reputation at risk</a>, appearing as if it had intervened in a partisan fashion to help a struggling incumbent president during the last two months of a brutal presidential campaign. And, indeed, stocks soared after the Fed's announcement.</p> <p>Yet, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/richard-adams-blog/2012/sep/07/obama-convention-momentum-jobs-live\">last week's jobs numbers were so awful</a> \u2013 far fewer jobs created than expected in August, with many more people dropping out of the labor force, and the lowest labor force participation rate in 30 years \u2013 that Bernanke was forced to act regardless of purported appearances. More significant is the fact that in Thursday's bold move of open-ended asset purchases and a firm commitment to loose monetary policy until the economy is clearly self-sustaining, Bernanke has finally acted to satisfy his critics who have complained for over a year that he has allowed himself to be bullied into inaction by withering criticism from Republicans.</p> <p>The open secret of the present, post-crisis monetary state of affairs is that QE3 will have very little direct effect on the economy, just as the previous rounds of quantitative easing had very little direct effect. While the Fed needs to ensure that longer-term borrowing costs for households and businesses stay low, its billions of dollars of monetary intervention is too small to directly affect debt markets that are trillions upon trillions of dollars deep. </p> <p>Out of tangible ammunition, all that Bernanke has left in his arsenal is his ability to manage expectations about the future. Specifically, what Bernanke must do is convince the markets that monetary policy will stay loose indefinitely into the future: that instead of obsessing about inflation, the Fed will act to rein in monetary policy only once employment has made a substantial recovery. And that also means a much more doveish attitude toward future inflation.</p> <p>While inflation is now exceptionally low (1.7% from June 2011 to June 2012, according to government statistics), indefinitely loose monetary policy means accepting a somewhat higher future rate of inflation \u2013 say around 4% \u2013 until it's clear that the economy has achieved a self-sustaining recovery. But before the harrumphing starts, note that the inflation rate late in President Reagan's term was 4%. As Bernanke understands from his own research as a professor at Princeton, a moderate amount of inflation will help the economy by inducing companies flush with cash to invest and by reducing the depressive effect of high levels of existing household debt.</p> <p>And that's enough to get Bernanke \u2013 a mild-mannered academic economist and a registered Republican \u2013 labeled a traitor by the right. The bullying has taken many forms \u2013 calls for an audit of the Fed, <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2011/08/15/296552/perry-on-bernanke-pretty-ugly-down-in-texas/\">threats of \"ugly treatment\"</a>, a plank in the Republican party platform for a study on a return to the gold standard, and <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/on-the-money/economy/244969-romney-confirms-plan-to-replace-bernanke-if-elected\">Romney's vow to replace Bernanke</a> if elected.</p> <p>Mind you, those words were in response to Bernanke's actions to pull the economy out of the death spiral caused by Wall Street's collapse in 2008 and 2009. Also mind you that the right's persistent howls that rampant inflation is just around the corner have been thoroughly disproved. In fact, inflation has been persistently undershot the Fed's own target of around 2%. Still, one can only imagine the teeth-gnashing and frothing at the mouth from conservatives and libertarians that will greet Thursday's announcements.</p> <p>It's hard to know if the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/09/did-republicans-deliberately-crash-us-economy\">Republicans simply want to destroy the economy</a> in order to deny Obama re-election, or if they really believe that Bernanke is corrupting the soul of America. In the end, it doesn't really matter. It's what Ben Bernanke <em>does</em> that matters. </p> <p>Contrast this act of lashing himself to the mast to the hesitant and diffident statements made by the Fed chairman earlier this year, in which he admitted that the economy was doing poorly but wouldn't commit to doing anything about it. And compare earlier statements of angst over tarnishing the Fed's \"hard-won inflation credibility\" to the more recent statement of concern about the fate of America's unemployed. Back then, it was clear that Bernanke, the clear-minded professor who knew what needed to be done, had been sidelined by Bernanke, the brow-beaten and bullied. Not any longer.</p> <p>I suspect that the right's unyielding and vitriolic nihilism towards the economy has been an education for Professor Bernanke. From Thursday's actions, we can only infer that it has finally freed Chairman Bernanke to do the right thing.</p>",
  "<p>Egypt's president, Mohamed Morsi, has moved to limit damage to sensitive relations with the US by pledging to protect foreign embassies on the eve of new protests called by the Muslim Brotherhood against a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/12/hollywood-connection-film-rage-libya?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">controversial film about the prophet Muhammad</a>.</p> <p>Morsi had been criticised for reacting slowly to Tuesday's attack on the US embassy in Cairo \u2013 and for asking the Egyptian embassy in Washington to take legal action in the US against the film's producers before commenting on the assault itself. Violent clashes in central Cairo raged on Wednesday and early on Thursday.</p> <p>\"I call on everyone to take that into consideration, to not violate Egyptian law \u2026 to not assault embassies,\" Morsi said on Thursday. \"I condemn and oppose all who \u2026 insult our prophet. [But] it is our duty to protect our guests and visitors from abroad.\"</p> <p>While international attention was focused on the fatal violence in Libya, also triggered by the film, many observers in Cairo were concerned about the consequences for relations between the US and Egypt, which have entered uncharted territory since the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak and the installation of Morsi, a Muslim Brotherhood veteran, as the country's first democratically elected president.</p> <p>Those concerns mounted after Barack Obama said of Egypt: \"I don't think we would consider them an ally, but we don't consider them an enemy. They are a new government that is trying to find its way.\" It was a lukewarm comment from the leader of a country that provides Egypt with $2bn in annual, mostly military, aid as the price for maintaining its 33-year-old peace treaty with Israel.</p> <p>On Thursday attempts were being made to defuse tensions. The Salafi al-Nour party said it was withdrawing from demonstrations. The Brotherhood said its members would stand silently outside mosques on Friday and not march to Tahrir Square or the nearby US embassy.</p> <p>Mahmoud Hussein, secretary general of the Brotherhood, criticised \"small groups\" that attacked the embassy and replaced its flag with a black banner similar to al-Qaida's. \"This is the work of about 20 people, not hundreds of protesters,\" he said. \"It's proof that some groups in the US and Egypt want to sabotage American-Egyptian relations.\" Morsi is due to pay his first official visit to the US this month.</p> <p>US experts and commentators have suggested Morsi is prioritising the appeasement of Islamists over national security issues that worry Washington. Tensions with Israel over Gaza and violence in the Sinai peninsula are other concerns.</p> <p>Exchanges on Twitter provided a revealing glimpse of double-talk and strains behind the scenes. The Brotherhood's English-language Twitter account @Ikwanweb reposted a message from the group's deputy head, Khairat el-Shater, saying he was \"relieved none of @USembassycairo staff was hurt\" and expressing his hope that US-Egypt relations could weather the storm.</p> <p>This was posted, however, while the Brotherhood's Arabic-language Twitter account and official website were praising the protests and calling for a million-man march on Friday. One Arabic-language article on the Brotherhood's site carried the headline \"Egyptians rise to defend the Prophet\".</p> <p>Noting the contradiction, the US embassy in Cairo tweeted a tart response: \"Thanks. By the way, have you checked out your own Arabic feeds? I hope you know we read those too.\" The Brotherhood responded: \"We understand you're under a lot of stress, but it will be more helpful if you point out exactly the Arabic feed of concern.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>[<em>Update below</em>]</strong></p> <p>You can't change the world if you don't believe in impossible things. On Wednesday, I was reminded that my obstinate faith in the ability of citizens to stand up against an all-out assault on civil liberties by my own government is not so absurd, after all. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/13/us/judge-blocks-controversial-indefinite-detention-law.html\">Judge Katherine Forrest (an Obama-appointed judge) granted people everywhere a permanent injunction against an unconstitutional provision, section 1021, in the NDAA</a> \u2013 and thus a reprieve from the terror of being indefinitely detained by the US military, without charge, evidence or trial.</p> <p>These incredible powers that my government asserted were its absolute right to possess have been held in check by one judge, seven plaintiffs, four attorneys, public figures who publicized our case when national media would not, and supporters around the globe who pitched in to help cover court costs. My government is so unresponsive, our politics so compromised and our slide away from a democratic republic and toward tyranny so steep, that despair and paralysis would have been the more \"normal\" reaction in the face of things.</p> <p>What I had, however, was a redhead's temper and a fierce sense that we would be in trouble under this law just for doing our work to defend civil liberties. I work with an international volunteer team of people who are dedicated to restoring rights, justice, sanity and decency to our world. And since we had come together and defended WikiLeaks and Bradley Manning \u2013 these pariahs of secretive governments \u2013 and since we were hosting online panel discussions with scholars and dissidents and were about to add to them Middle Eastern revolutionaries, and because I feel responsible for this team of people that I lead, I was not about to stand down on the NDAA.</p> <p>It made me see red to think that with the highest of hopes and most altruistic of aims, I could have led innocent people into danger. This NDAA clause meant that we could be labeled \"associated forces\" of terrorists simply because I had been in direct contact with WikiLeaks, or because I wanted to ask Iraqi citizens on film how it felt to have my country kill their family members in a war founded on lies.</p> <p>My country has worked hard to define and limit the parameters and power of our resistance to this downward slide. A long list of travesties, including the exponential increase in government secrecy, systematic denial of FOIA requests by national security agencies, the building of a surveillance state and the loss of fundamental rights to privacy, the persecution of whistleblowers and the criminalization of protest \u2026 all have formed a disconcerting tapestry. Paired with cynical euphemisms (\"extraordinary rendition\" rather than kidnapping, \"enhanced interrogation\" rather than torture) and disingenuous rhetoric on the part of the president, the context for the NDAA has become an Orwellian milieu where abuses are \"justice\" and \"American liberty\" is secured by taking our rights away. The NDAA was the piece de resistance: its attempt to dramatically expand the power of the federal government to pick and choose who the \"terrorists\" are would have been a power that could see journalists and activists indefinitely detained merely for exercising our rights of free speech. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396129437\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/13/1347556538298/katherineforrest_220.jpg\" alt=\"Judge Katherine Forrest\" width=\"220\" height=\"271\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US District Judge Katherine B Forrest</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In court, government attorneys repeatedly refused to define what they meant by key terms \u2013 \"associated forces\", \"material support\", and \"independent\" advocacy and journalism. Did our support for WikiLeaks make us \"associated forces\" of a group some in my government have labeled as terrorists? Would a panel with a member from Hamas be constituted as our providing the organization material \"support\"? Judge Forrest asked my government similar questions <a href=\"http://www.courthousenews.com/2012/09/12/50218.htm\">in her ruling</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Where is the line between what the government would consider 'journalistic reporting' and 'propaganda'? What does 'independent' mean? Who will make such determinations? Will there be an office established to read articles, watch videos, and evaluate speeches in order to make judgments along a spectrum of where the support is 'modest' or 'substantial'.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Thanks to a small handful of determined citizens and a judge who didn't roll over in the face of accusations of interfering with the laws of war, there will be no need for such an office. Sometimes, it is worth believing in impossible things \u2013 like standing up to the United States government, and daring to believe you can win. Sometimes, we do. And because we did, for now at least, and for most of us, due process still stands.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 UPDATE</strong> (at 4pm ET, 13 September 2012]: Less than 24 hours after Section 1021 was permanently enjoined, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-13/u-s-appeals-order-blocking-u-s-military-detention-law.html\">Obama administration lawyers filed an appeal</a>. US government attorneys repeatedly claimed that 1021 and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization_for_Use_of_Military_Force_Against_Terrorists\">Authorization of Military Force (AUMF)</a> provide the same powers. Judge Forrest made it clear her ruling would not interfere in any way with the AUMF.</p> <p>So why did they appeal? Either because they had to, because doing the right thing would not be acceptable in an election cycle \u2013 for fear of charges of being \"soft on terror\" \u2013 or because President Obama doesn't actually mean most of what he says when it comes to protecting democracy and civil liberties.</p>",
  "<p>Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke pledged to keep injecting money into the US economy until it recovers Thursday as it announced a rolling program to buy $40bn a month in mortgage-backed securities.</p> <p>The widely anticipated third round of quantitative easing \u2013 dubbed QE3 \u2013 comes after Fed chairman Ben Bernanke had said he was increasingly concerned about the recovery.</p> <p>Bernanke said the plan was aimed at reviving the jobs market by stimulating the still troubled housing market. \"This is a Main Street policy because what we're about here are jobs,\" he said at a press conference.</p> <p>He said the Fed stood ready to take more action if the situation deteriorated further and that the he would not \"rush to tighten policy\" even when signs of a stronger recovery emerge.</p> <p>Wall Street cheered the move, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average soaring over 200 points. Gus Faucher, senior economist with PNC Bank, said the open-ended nature of the mortgage bond buying scheme \u2013 a marked break from previous QE efforts \u2013 sent a clear signal that the Fed was committed to propping up the US recovery.</p> <p>\"It was much more aggressive than we were expecting,\" he said. \"Bernanke clearly feels that the recovery in the jobs market just isn't there.\"</p> <p>On top of the new scheme, the Fed said it would continue its action to bring down long-term interest rates, dubbed \"Operation Twist\", through the end of this year. Together the schemes will pump $85bn a month into the US economy.</p> <p>Bernanke said there were signs of recovery in the housing market and in the wider economy, but the Fed feels the economy is not yet strong enough to go it alone. </p> <p>His move so close to the election is likely to draw fire from Republican critics, though a response to the announcement from presidential candidate Mitt Romney was notable by its absence.</p> <p>The open-ended nature of QE3 will infuriate those who already argue Bernanke is too interventionist. But Faucher said that if the latest stimulus program had been given an expiration date, investors would once again have been asking what comes next. \"He's done this twice already. This is a way of saying we are sticking with it,\" he said.</p> <p>The Fed chairman refused to be drawn on precisely what signs would have to emerge before he turns off the spigot. \"We are looking for ongoing, sustained improvement in the labor market. There isn't a specific number in mind but what we've seen in the last six months isn't it,\" he said.</p> <p>The statement came after clear signals from Bernanke that he was preparing to act. The economy was \"far from satisfactory\" and the continuing high rate of unemployment threatened to \"wreak structural damage,\" Bernanke said in a speech at the high-powered annual economic summit of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City last month.</p> <p>Since that speech, the economic situation appears to have deteriorated. In August, the US added just 61,000 new jobs, half what many economists had been expecting. The unemployment rate ticked down from 8.3% to 8.1% but was driven down not by hiring but by 368,000 Americans leaving the labor force.</p> <p>Worrying economic news has continued to emerge since the job's report. On Thursday more evidence of a weakening global economy emerged as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development issued its latest report. The OECD found indications of slower growth in the US, Japan, China, India and Russia among others.</p> <p>The Fed chairman warned that the US still faced \"headwinds\" most notably the so-called fiscal cliff, a year end deadline for the expiration of Bush-era tax cuts and the imposition of massive spending cuts. Unless a political solution is found to the fiscal cliff, the US could be plunged back into recession, according to the Congressional Budget Office.</p> <p>He said the uncertainty over the fiscal cliff had been a major topic of conversation among the Fed's committee members and that uncertainty was a drag on the economy. \"A lot of businesses are waiting to see whether that problem will be resolved and if so how,\" he said.</p> <p>Bernanke's actions are likely to spark a furious backlash from some members of the Republican party, who have criticised his past interventions. The Fed chairman has become a whipping boy for the right, and Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney's vice-presidential pick, has clearly stated he is against more stimulus.</p> <p>\"I'm not a fan of more stimulus or more easing,\" Ryan said last month in a CNBC interview. \"The benefits are clearly outweighed by the long-term costs of this. Iit's not working, and all this loose money from the Fed is basically bailing out the fact that President Obama has failed on fiscal policy.\"</p> <p>All but one of the Fed's committee, Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, voted for the new stimulus package.</p>",
  "<p>Did an inflammatory anti-Muslim film trailer that appeared spontaneously on YouTube prompt the attack that left four US diplomats dead, including US ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens? American officials have <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/09/13/161044872/u-s-probes-whether-libyan-attacks-were-planned\">suggested</a> that the assault was pre-planned, allegedly by of one of the Jihadist groups that emerged since the Nato-led overthrow of Libya's Gaddafi regime. So even though the deadly scene in Benghazi may not have resulted directly from the angry reaction to the Islamophobic video, the violence has helped realize the apocalyptic visions of the film's backers.</p> <p>Produced and promoted by a strange collection of rightwing Christian evangelicals and exiled Egyptian Copts, the trailer was created with the intention of both destabilizing post-Mubarak Egypt and roiling the US presidential election. As a consultant for the film named Steve Klein said: \"We went into this knowing this was probably going to happen.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/12/sam-bacile-in-hiding_n_1876044.html\">The Associated Press's initial report</a> on the trailer \u2013 an amateurish, practically unwatchable production called The Innocence of Muslims \u2013 identified a mysterious character, \"Sam Bacile\", as its producer. Bacile told the Associated Press that he was a Jewish Israeli real estate developer living in California. He said that he raised $5m for the production of the film from \"100 Jewish donors\", an unusual claim echoing Protocols of the Elders of Zion-style fantasies. Unfortunately, the extensive history of Israeli and ultra-Zionist <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/168374/sugar-mama-anti-muslim-hate\">funding</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175334/tomgram:_max_blumenthal,_the_great_fear_\">promotion</a> of Islamophobic <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=2fnTHyyvzWg\">propaganda</a> in the United States provided Bacile's remarkable statement with the ring of truth. </p> <p>Who was Bacile? The Israeli government could not confirm his citizenship, and for a full day, no journalist was able to determine whether he existed or not. After being duped by Bacile, AP <a href=\"http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_EGYPT_FILMMAKER?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT\">traced</a> his address to the home of Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, a militant Coptic separatist and felon convicted of check fraud. On September 13, US law enforcement officials <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AP/status/246252690190004224\">confirmed</a> that \"Sam Bacile\" was an alias Nakoula used to advance his various scams, which apparently included the production of The Innocence of Muslims.</p> <p>According to an actor in the film, the all-volunteer cast was <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5942748/it-makes-me-sick-actress-in-muhammed-movie-says-she-was-deceived-had-no-idea-it-was-about-islam\">deceived</a> into believing they were acting in a benign biblical epic about \"how things were 2,000 years ago\". The script was titled Desert Warrior, and its contents made no mention of Muhammad \u2013 his name was dubbed into the film during post-production. On the set, a gray-haired Egyptian man who identified himself only as \"Sam\" (Nakoula) chatted aimlessly in Arabic with a group of friends while posing as the director. A <a href=\"http://casting.backstage.com/jobseekerx/viewjob.asp?jobid=TXYxNuSgxoQo3eKH2L2DW8iOkP2v\">casting notice</a> for Desert Warrior listed the film's real director as <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003085\">\"Alan Roberts\"</a>. This could likewise be a pseudonym, although there is a veteran Hollywood hand responsible for such masterpieces as The Happy Hooker Goes Hollywood and The Sexpert who goes by the same name.</p> <p>Before Nakoula was unmasked, the only person to publicly claim any role in the film was Klein, an insurance salesman and Vietnam veteran from Hemet, California, who emerged from the same Islamophobic movement that produced the Norwegian mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik. Styling themselves as \"counter-Jihadists\", anti-Muslim crusaders like Klein took their cues from top propagandists like Pamela Geller, the blogger who once <a href=\"http://atlasshrugs2000.typepad.com/atlas_shrugs/2008/10/how-could-stanl.html\">suggested</a> that Barack Obama was the lovechild of Malcolm X, and Robert Spencer, a pseudo-academic expert on Muslim radicalization who claimed that Islam was no more than \"a developed doctrine and tradition of warfare against unbelievers\". Both Geller and Spencer were <a href=\"http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2011/summer/the-anti-muslim-inner-circle\">labeled</a> hate group leaders by the Southern Poverty Law Center.</p> <p>Klein is an enthusiastic commenter on Geller's website, Atlas Shrugged, where he recently complained about Mitt Romney's \"support for a Muslim state in Israel's heartland\". In July 2011, Spencer's website, Jihad Watch, promoted a rally Klein organized to demand the firing of Los Angeles County sheriff Lee Baca, whom he painted as a dupe for the Muslim Brotherhood.</p> <p>On his personal Facebook page, <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/ALTAR-or-ABOLISH/270356598857\">Altar or Abolish,</a> Klein obsesses over the Muslim Brotherhood, describing the organization as \"a global network of Muslims attacking to convert the world's 6 billion people to Islam or kill them\". Klein urges a violent response to the perceived threat of Islam in the United States, posting an image to his website depicting a middle-American family with a mock tank turret strapped to the roof of their car. \"Can you direct us to the nearest mosque?\" read a caption Klein added to the photo.</p> <p>In 2011, during his campaign to oust Sheriff Baca, Klein forged an alliance with <a href=\"http://www.atvsat.com\">Joseph Nasrallah,</a> an extremist Coptic broadcaster who shared his fear and resentment of the Muslim Brotherhood. Nasrallah appeared from out of nowhere at a boisterous rally against the construction of an Islamic community center in downtown Manhattan on September 11, 2010, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEJMRDqsMCE\">warning</a> a few hundred riled-up Tea Party types that Muslims \"came and conquered our country the same way they want to conquer America\".</p> <p>Organized by Geller and Spencer, the rally was carefully timed to coincide with the peak of the midterm congressional election campaign, in which many rightwing Republicans hoped to leverage rising anti-Muslim sentiment into resentment against the presidency of Obama.</p> <p>Through his friendship with Nasrallah, Klein encountered another radical Coptic separatist named Morris Sadek. Sadek has been banned from returning to his Egypt, where he is widely hated for his outrageous anti-Muslim displays. On the day of the Ground Zero rally, for instance, Sadek was seen <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAAKiDPdnmw&amp;feature=relmfu\">parading</a> around the streets of Washington, DC, on September 11, 2010, with a crucifix in one hand and a Bible implanted with the American flag in the other. \"Islam is evil!\" he shouted. \"Islam is a cult religion!\"</p> <p>With another US election approaching, and the Egyptian government suddenly under the control of the Muslim Brotherhood, Klein and Sadek joined Nakoula in preparing what would be their greatest propaganda stunt to date: the Innocence of Muslims. As soon as the film appeared on YouTube, Sadek <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/12/hollywood-connection-film-rage-libya\">promoted</a> it on his website, transforming the obscure clip into a viral source of outrage in the Middle East. And like clockwork, on September 11, crowds of Muslim protesters stormed the walls of the US embassy in Cairo, demanding retribution for the insult to the prophet Muhammad. The demonstrations ricocheted into Libya, where the deadly attack that may have been only peripherally related to the film occurred.</p> <p>For Sadek, the chaos was an encouraging development. He and his allies had been steadfastly opposed to the Egyptian revolution, fearing that it would usher in the Muslim Brotherhood as the country's new leaders. Now that their worst fears were realized, Coptic extremists and other pro-Mubarak dead-enders were resorting to subterfuge to undermine the ruling party, while pointing to the destabilizing impact of their efforts as proof of the government's bankruptcy. As Sadek <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/09/201291214042970150.html\">said,</a> \"the violence that [the film] caused in Egypt is further evidence of how violent the religion and people\".</p> <p>For far-right Christian right activists like Klein, the attacks on American interests abroad seemed likely to advance their ambitions back in the US. With Americans confronted with shocking images of violent Muslims in Egypt and Libya on the evening news, their <a href=\"http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/musamsurvey.htm\">already negative</a> attitudes toward their Muslim neighbors were likely to harden. In turn, the presidential candidates, Obama and Romney, would be forced to compete for who could take the hardest line against Islamic \"terror\".</p> <p>A patrician moderate constantly on the defensive against his own right flank, Romney fell for the bait, baselessly <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/12/mitt-romney-obama-libya_n_1877406.html\">accusing</a> Obama of \"sympathiz[ing] with those who waged the attacks\" and of issuing \"an apology for America's values\". The clumsy broadside backfired in dramatic fashion, opening Romney to strident <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/middleeast/la-na-libya-campaign-20120913,0,1662505.story\">criticism</a> from across the spectrum, including from embarrassed Republican members of Congress. Obama wasted no time in <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/politico44/2012/09/report-drones-headed-to-libya-135317.html\">authorizing</a> a round of drone strikes on targets across Libya, which are likely to deepen regional hostility to the US.</p> <p>A group of fringe extremists had proven that with a little bit of money and an unbelievably cynical scam, they could shape history to fit their apocalyptic vision. But in the end, they were not immune to the violence they incited. </p> <p>According to Copts Today, an Arabic news outlet focusing on Coptic affairs, Sadek was seen taking a leisurely stroll down Washington's M Street on September 11, soaking in the sun on a perfect autumn day.

Well, here's the Korean Robbie \u2013 he's plump and he appears, in his sweaty, chubby stockiness, to be gently mocking the medium that has made him a star. And he \u2013 Park Jae-Sang, alias Psy, a 34-year-old from South Korea and alumnus (as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/aug/30/new-band-sonnymoon\" title=\"\">so many New Bands of the Day</a> are tending to be these days) of the Berklee College of Music \u2013 is a star, to the tune of 159m views on YouTube for his single <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0\" title=\"\">Gangnam Style</a>. Viral? We'd swear when we started writing this sentence there were only 158m.</p> <p>Gangnam Style is happening without our permission. It is, basically, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EcjWd-O4jI\" title=\"\">Pump up the Jam</a> meets <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiBYM6g8Tck\" title=\"\">the Macarena</a> with a dash of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ui_MVLPRS4\" title=\"\">Cotton Eye Joe</a>. It's a novelty dance song accompanied by a video featuring Jae-Sang doing a series of \"hilarious\" comedy moves apparently mimicking the motion one makes while horse riding, in a variety of locations around the titular well-heeled district of South Korea, including an outdoor yoga session and a stable. The song is <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2012/09/04/gangnam-style-infographic/\" title=\"\">said to have satirical intent</a>, designed to expose the gulf between the wealthy and poor in Gangnam (it holds 7.1% of the nation's wealth compared to New York's 7.68% despite only comprising 15 square miles as opposed to NY's 47,213). We have no idea why that necessitates Psy dancing like a jockey, backwards in some instances.</p> <p>Still, that hasn't stopped it engulfing all areas of the known cosmos, while Psy has become celebrities' pet new name to drop this season. \"Help, I'm in a Gangnam-style K-hole,\" tweeted Katy Perry while fellow Psy-loving Twitterati include Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg, LMFAO, Robbie (heretofore known as the British Psy) and Britney Spears, who appeared especially on the<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZmkU5Pg1sw\" title=\"\"> Ellen Degeneres Show</a> so she could learn the manoeuvre from the man himself.

It's not. It's generic ravey Euro dance with guitars, or at least it is if Psy's other tunes are any measure. These range from the thrashy disco of Blue Frog and Champion, which heavily samples Axel F by Harold Faltermeyer, to the homogenous guitar/synth sub-Prodigy blare that is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6f-8I1pb8k\" title=\"\">Right Now</a> and the rap-metal revisited of We Are the One, although we <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCeEq7Hma8M\" title=\"\">like the video</a>, in which the North Korean military kidnap Psy.</p> <p><strong>The buzz: </strong>\"Crotch thrusting, booty shaking and furious hip grinding: this music video has every necessary ingredient to be a pop hit\" \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/09/12/psy-gangnam-style-south-korean-pop-tune-goes-viral-video_n_1876293.html?utm_hp_ref=uk\" title=\"\">the Huffington Post</a>.</p> <p><strong>The truth: </strong>Neigh, neigh and thrice neigh.</p> <p><strong>Most likely to:</strong> Whinny.</p> <p><strong>Least likely to:</strong> Win a Grammy.</p> <p><strong>What to buy:</strong> Gangnam Style is released by Universal/Schoolboy on 22 October.</p> <p><strong>File next to:</strong> Los Del Rio, Technotronic, Rednex, Robbie Williams.</p> <p><strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/officialpsy\" title=\"\">facebook.com/officialpsy</a>.</p> <p><strong>Friday's new band:</strong> SOS.</p>",
  "<p>Conservative media personality Glenn Beck's impassioned yelling and excessive hand gestures are back on US airwaves as of 5pm ET Wednesday, when his online streaming network TheBlaze TV first aired on Dish Network. </p> <p>Just what will this channel offer? According to Beck, truth. </p> <p>On his weekday show the Glenn Beck Program, which kicked off his first hour back on TV, Beck explained how TheBlaze TV will \"change the way the media works forever\". This will be done, Beck explained repeatedly, by addressing the failures of the rest of the news media who in his view are lying to you about everything. </p> <p>He then listed the things the news media is lying to you about, including: Egypt, President Barack Obama, oil, the economy, Mitt Romney. </p> <p>Beck was well aware that in addition to getting a new audience from Dish subscribers, the show's first hour would also be eyed by tortured journalists, and he took the time to constantly reiterate his truth-delivering platform and to promote the next year of real-world events he's sponsoring. These include something mysteriously called The Project and American Dream Labs \u2013 which seeks to revolutionize education, finance and entertainment in the US.</p> <p>Beck's 24-hour \"news, information and entertainment network\", originally launched as GBTV and will be available to 14m Dish cable subscribers, in addition to being available for a subscription online. He launched the online-only network in 2011 after his show on Fox News was cancelled following <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/84662/the-decline-glenn-beck\">a loss of one million viewers in a year</a>.</p> <p>More than 300,000 people are already online subscribers to the network that includes a comedy news show \u2013 The BS of A \u2013 children's show Liberty TreeHouse and opinion programming from major conservative pundits. </p> <p>TheBlaze TV chief executive Christopher Balfe said <a href=\"http://www.glennbeck.com/2012/09/12/theblaze-tv-dish-network-glenn-beck/\">in a blog post on the site</a> that they are bringing the online-only venture to broadcast television a year after its launch due to the stream's success and the multi-technology viewing habits of television consumers. Balfe writes: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don't think that consumers want to have to subscribe separately to TheBlaze, CNN and HBO from three different places with three different interfaces and get three different monthly charges on their credit card. Cable and satellite companies have created an excellent billing and payment infrastructure with over 100,000,000 customers \u2013 it's smart for us to take advantage of that.</p> </blockquote> <p>In their press release, Dish Network notes that they provide \"news and commentary programming representing all points on the political spectrum\", pointing to their inclusion of MSNBC, Current and CNN. They also include entertainment channels BBC America and Comedy Central \u2013&#xa0;home to The Daily Show and The Colbert Report \u2013&#xa0;as evidence of their multiple viewpoint perspective. </p> <p>\"After being phenomenally successful with his online streaming network, we're pleased to host Glenn Beck's return to broadcast TV, especially during this exciting and important political season,\" Dish chief executive and president Joseph Clayton said in a statement. \"With Glenn's return, Dish is truly the one stop for news, opinion and perspective across the full political spectrum.\" </p> <p>One thing Dish subscribers don't have access to is channels owned by AMC Networks, which has been in a legal dispute with Dish since July, keeping shows including Mad Men, Breaking Bad and the Walking Dead off the air.</p>",
  "<p>Deadly clashes in a volatile district on Kenya's coast have raised fears that politicians may be exploiting tribal rivalries before elections next March, with some observers also suggesting that weapons and militants from neighbouring Somalia may be involved.</p> <p>At least 116 people have been killed in the Tana river delta since late August as hundreds of fighters from the Pokomo and Orma tribes, armed with guns, spears and bows and arrows, attacked each other's villages, burning homes and killing people.</p> <p>The violence has exposed a potent cocktail of tensions before the first election since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/28/kenya.international\" title=\"\">more than 1,200 people were killed after a disputed 2007 vote</a> in east Africa's largest economy.</p> <p>Thirty-eight people, including five children and nine police officers, were killed in Kilelengwani village on Monday.

An assistant minister, Dhadho Godhana, was arrested on Wednesday over an allegation that he helped to fuel the violence, which started in August when Pokomo raiders killed more than 50 Orma. Godhana has pleaded not guilty to charges of inciting violence.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch said its research showed that at least three other politicians might have been involved. It also found that police failed to respond to reports from residents over the past six months that violence could be imminent.</p> <p>\"Members of both communities, including victims of the attacks, told Human Rights Watch that area politicians who hoped to win seats in next year's elections were involved in the violence on both sides and that the villagers had informed the police about their suspicions,\" HRW said.</p> <p>The US state department said that the attacks threatened to destabilise the surrounding region and <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2012/09/197689.htm\" title=\"\">urged the government to bring those responsible to trial</a> and unite opposing factions.</p> <p>Pokomo farmers and the semi-nomadic Orma have clashed before over water, land and grazing but Phyllis Muema, executive director of the <a href=\"http://www.kecosce.org/\" title=\"\">Kenya Community Support Centre</a>, said this time was different.</p> <p>\"This is actually a massacre. The level of killing shows very clearly that this is not just a resource-based conflict\u2026 The sophistication of the arms they are using indicates that they have acquired them, we suspect, from neighbouring Somalia,\" Muema said.</p> <p>Kenya has thousands of troops in Somalia as part of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/01/kenyan-somali-forces-al-shabaab\" title=\"\">an African Union peacekeeping force fighting the Islamist militants of al-Shabaab</a>. The Kenyans are moving towards al-Shabaab's stronghold at Kismayo, raising concerns that some militants might flee across the border into Kenya's tinderbox coastal region.</p> <p>This tourist region, where five-star luxury co-exists with extreme poverty and where indigenous tribes have long felt neglected by authorities, is seen as a potential flashpoint before the March vote.</p> <p>Some Kenyan commentators have linked the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/06/kenya-ocean-coast-secessionist-party\" title=\"\">once-banned Mombasa Republican Council</a>, which wants the coast to secede, to the Tana river clashes, but the secretary-general, Randu Nzai Ruwa, denied the charges.</p> <p>\"The MRC is not involved in this\u2026 We are fighting for the coastal people,\" he said, adding that he believed the clashes had been orchestrated to drive people off lucrative sugar cane farms.</p> <p>Kenyan elections have often triggered violence between tribes, as political parties tend to draw support from a particular ethnic group. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/23/kenya-trial-international-criminal-court\" title=\"\">Three senior politicians and a radio presenter</a> will stand trial at the <a href=\" [http://www.icc-cpi.int/menus/icc/]\" title=\"\">international criminal court</a> in April next year over their alleged roles in fuelling the 2007/08 violence, and many Kenyans had hoped this would act as a deterrent in future elections.</p> <p>However, two of those facing trial are still running for president, and analysts say violence is a real possibility again.</p> <p>The stakes are even higher this time. In March, Kenyans will, for the first time, vote for county governors and senators, meaning there is more power to be won at the local level.</p> <p>The police service has been criticised for failing to stop the bloodshed.</p> <p>\"The response has been pathetic,\" Robert Ndege, a political risk consultant at Africapractice, said. \"If ([the security forces)] can't contain one flashpoint, what happens if this is repeated across the country?\"</p> <p>Ndung'u Wainaina, of the <a href=\"http://www.icpcafrica.org/\" title=\"\">International Centre for Policy and Conflict</a>, said security forces must have known attacks were being planned. \"There is no way a group of about 300 militia can\u2026 make a brazen attack without some very strong powerful support,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Near panic is <a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/p/news/opinion/opedcolumnists/the_gop_mini_panic_ukwIZr5aOEp95RGgkSAIrI\">setting in</a> among some Mitt Romney supporters over recent poll results showing President Obama expanding his lead. I expect that lead to recede, at least somewhat, following the dissipation of Obama's convention bounce. Yet, it's the response of some Republicans that has me interested.</p> <p>There are certainly conservatives who think that Mitt Romney <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/10/laura-ingraham-gop-obama-shut-down-party_n_1871911.html\"><em>should&#xa0;win</em></a> in this economy. As Jon Bernstein <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/post/why-republicans-are-puzzled-by-the-polls/2012/09/11/e7f1dd6e-fc3b-11e1-98c6-ec0a0a93f8eb_blog.html\">points out</a>, Republicans are likely to see the economy in as bad shape as it was during the 2008 economic collapse. They are also more likely to say they are hearing negative news about the economy than either Democrats or independents. This follows the traditional trend of the opposition party seeing the economy as in <a href=\"http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/07/26/more-on-partisan-politics-and-economic-perceptions-and-economic-voting/\">worse condition</a> than the president's party does.</p> <p>Gallup tracks a <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/157382/key-indicators-better-obama-took-office.aspx\">number of economic indicators</a> and all have shown improvement since Obama took office. The economic confidence index still stinks, at -27, but that's up from -58 at the beginning of Obama's term. The percentage of Americans satisfied with the way things are going is up 10 percentage points, from 15% to 25%. And 48% believe the standard of living is improving, against the 35% who did in February 2009. The job creation index has risen to 19, from -5. The absolute numbers are still a big bag of \"meh\", but they are going in the right direction.</p> <p>In fact, the economy returning to growth provides a context that suggests Mitt Romney could win but won't automatically. Three weeks ago, Sean Trende looked at <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/08/24/why_the_weak_economy_doesnt_doom_obama.html\">eight economic variables</a> and found that Obama's economy is a \"'tweener\": it's level with where it was for George HW Bush's 1992 losing effort, and better than Richard Nixon's tight-as-nails loss of 1960; but it's slightly worse than the economy was when George W Bush rode to victory in 2004. In other words, incumbent party's nominees with comparable economies to Obama's have both won and lost.</p> <p>Political science econometric models that try to predict the presidential vote based off the economy also paint a similarly close picture. These models use a host of economic indicators and other variables such as incumbency. The ten models <a href=\"http://pollyvote.forecastingprinciples.com/index.php/pollyvote-2012/econometric-models.html\">tracked by PollyVote</a> that are economically based predict President Obama losing by 0.2 percentage points. None of these models is perfect and all have margins of error, but together, they indicate a race that either candidate could win.</p> <p>So, I can't quite agree with those convinced that President Obama is the favorite thanks to the economy. Ezra Klein's Wonkblog, for instance, argues that the fundamentals <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/11/the-economy-slightly-favors-obama-not-romney/\">slightly favor Obama</a>. The Wonkblog's own Dylan Matthews surveyed five economic models and three of them had Obama slightly ahead. But as I pointed out above, a wider examination of econometric models has neither candidate decisively ahead. Part of this \"Obama is a slight favorite\" conclusion comes from the fact that the Washington Post's own econometric model has Obama as strong favorite.</p> <p>The model formerly known as Alan Abramowitz's <a href=\"http://votamatic.org/how-it-works/\">Time for Change</a> and Seth Hill, John Sides, and Lynn Vaverck's <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/2012-election-predictor/\">Washington Post's</a> forecast paint an election that Obama should win more than 80% of the time. Both utilize gross domestic product data, which has been growing slowly. Yet, <a href=\"http://fairmodel.econ.yale.edu/vote2012/index2.htm\">Ray Fair's model</a> also uses GDP and that has Obama a slight underdog. Why?</p> <p>President Obama inherited a bad economy from President Bush. Abramowitz and Hill et al try to model this factor in one or another, while Fair does not. Many modeling wonks will argue over whether the addition of a variable for incumbency is merely \"data-dredging\" (that is, a fishing expedition for data to fit the case). This much is certain, however: presidents who take over for the other party against an incumbent have historically won a higher share of the vote under similar economic conditions compared to those running under the party banner that has won two or more elections in a row.</p> <p>Last month, I examined how different economic models reacted when you add a variable <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/03/latest-jobs-numbers-obama-campaign\">that controls for an incumbent's</a> \"grace period\". Douglas Hibbs' disposable personal income model is arguably one of the most pessimistic for Romney \u2013 but add in a variable for \"grace period\" and then Obama is the slightest of favorites. Nate Silver's job growth model, given current growth, has Obama as a slight underdog. Add in a variable controlling for the fact he took over from Bush, and Obama becomes a favorite.&#xa0;</p> <p>The point is that if Obama does win, he probably owes at least part of it to the fact that voters still blame President Bush for the economy (as many polls indicate). Had John McCain somehow won in 2008, he'd have faced far more daunting re-election odds because he couldn't pin the country's economic woes on the opposition.</p> <p>Overall, this economy creates a perfect storm of potential for misperception. The absolute numbers for figures such as unemployment rate are weak, but job growth is getting better slowly \u2013 though people see what they want to see, and we know Republicans are more half-empty about it. But voters at this point seem more likely to give President Obama the benefit of the doubt \u2013 on the understanding that he inherited this mess from President Bush.</p>"
