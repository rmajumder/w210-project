  "<p>\u2022 An anxious time for all who wait to learn what will happen to the Metropolitan PC&#xa0;whose evidence against a black teenager accused of assault was contradicted by the all-seeing eye of CCTV. The officer claimed the youth \u2013 who says he has been stopped 50 times by police \u2013 assaulted him, causing grazing and bruising to the officer's knuckles. The CCTV was shown to the court, after which the Crown Prosecution Service offered no further evidence and the case collapsed. What of the officer concerned? Will he be the star of act two in this drama? And what next for the youngster? Well, he says he will sue, but Scotland Yard finds itself unable to comment on his claim to have been targeted with gusto for stop and search. Why so? \"We do not normally discuss how many particular stops an individual may have been subject to out of respect to their privacy,\" says the force. Priceless, really.</p> <p>\u2022 A rum state of affairs, meanwhile, if it is the case that police officers have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/26/met-police-officers-overwork?new%20sfeed=true\" title=\"\">sleeping on floors, in cupboards and in branches of McDonald's</a> to keep up with the shift demands of events like the diamond jubilee and the Olympics. A policeman's lot is not a happy one, at the best of times, but it should be bigger than a cupboard. They are cross with their political masters. But it seems that at the Yard there is also a deal of disgruntlement with the man at the top, Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe, who has not yet won the loyalty and affection of the rank and file, as did some of his predecessors. At a recent leaving do his name was mentioned and the room was filled with boos.</p> <p>\u2022 The revelation by the distinguished 7Up director <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Apted\" title=\"\">Michael Apted</a> that he has made an unshown Rolling Stones documentary which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/26/rolling-stones-mick-jagger-michael-apted?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Mick Jagger simply stopped in 2002</a>, with what Apted described as his \"hitman\", adds to the mystery of just how many Rolling Stones documentaries have never seen TV or cinema screens. We know Apted is not alone. On the list of frustrated directors is Jane (Painted Babies) Treays. There are others. Archivists will wonder what it is that Mick so fears when he is committed to celluloid. Those privileged to train their lens on him have, on occasion, been asked to sign a legal documents agreeing never to disclose anything about what happened before and after the filming. We can tell you that he is smaller than he appears on screen. Anything else could see us hauled before the beak.</p> <p>\u2022 And after a year in the building, (John) Terry Towers in leafy Surrey is looking near completion. The Roman pillars are up on the grand forum entrance, and soon the 11 bedrooms and four bathrooms will be ready for the (ex-) England captain and tribe to move in from next door. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jul/13/john-terry-cleared-anton-ferdinand\" title=\"\">One suspects Rio and Anton Ferdinand will be absent from the housewarming</a>. By contrast, Ashley Cole may be smiled upon. But it doesn't stop there. Neighbours look on excitedly and discuss the creation of a fishing lake as well as a development in which to stable the horses. Behold, the new aristocracy.</p> <p>\u2022 Rejoicing among the BBC old guard that the corporation, three days after being told by the Diary and a full 10 days after being warned by former colleagues, has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/22/hugh-muir-diary-bbc-osman? newsfeed=\" true\"\" title=\"\">retracted its assertion that legendary correspondent John Osman is dead</a>. The heroic man of words and deeds is not dead, complainants insisted after Jon Williams, the editor of World News, said as much on a blog. He is merely camping in Europe. That is not the same thing. After more pressure on Friday morning, the blog was amended later that day. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2012/08/lawrence_of_asia.html\" title=\"\">It now says that Osman, a cheery and active soul, is alive and well at 80</a>. In fact he is 83; but still, the battle is over. He lives, and everything else is detail.</p> <p>\u2022 Finally, can it be true, as reported by the Telegraph, that Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee for the US presidency, is <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/us-election/9500834/US-election-Liam-Fox-feeding-ideas-to-Mitt-Romneys-Republicans.html\" title=\"\">taking careers advice from the former defence secretary and talisman of the Tory hard right, Dr Liam Fox</a>? Has he not heard of Adam Werritty? Or of Dr Fox's charity, the Atlantic Bridge, which shut up shop after being found in contravention of its purpose by the Charity Commission? All&#xa0;quite worrying and, as you will appreciate, we wish Mitt all the best.</p> <p><em> Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hugh_muir\" title=\"\"><em>@hugh_muir</em></a></p>",
  "<p>Rob Portman, the Ohio senator who was a front-runner for the job of Mitt Romney's vice-presidential running mate until he was pipped to the post by the tea party favourite Paul Ryan, has agreed to play another crucial role in the Republican race for the White House \u2013 that of Barack Obama.</p> <p>Portman has signed up to play-act Obama in debate prep sessions ahead of the televised clashes between Romney and the president. He will act as Romney's sparring partner over the next few weeks, allowing the candidate to test his debating form before he faces the real Obama in front of real TV lights.</p> <p>In doing so, Portman will revive a role he assumed in 2008 when he helped the then Republican presidential candidate, John McCain, prepare for his TV debates with Obama.</p> <p>The position, <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/08/27/first-on-cnn-portman-to-play-obama-in-romney-debate-prep/,\">first reported by CNN</a>, confirms Portman as the supreme debate prepper of his generation on the Republican side. In addition to playing Obama in sessions with McCain four years ago, he assumed the role of John Edwards in practice sessions with Dick Cheney ahead of the 2004 vice-presidential debate, as well as Joe Lieberman and Al Gore.</p> <p>Doug Holtz-Eakin, former chief economic policy adviser to McCain during the 2008 presidential campaign, sat in on several of the prep sessions in which Portman played Obama. Eakin told the Guardian that he combined deep political knowledge with an innate acting ability which was invaluable practice for McCain ahead of the real thing.</p> <p>\"He's a phenomenal actor. He didn't just know Obama's policy positions \u2013 he played him,\" Eakin said.</p> <p>Rick Lazio turned to Portman for help in preparing for three televised debates with Hillary Clinton during the race for the New York senate seat in 2000. Lazio said that Portman threw himself at the task, immersing himself in Clinton's mannerisms and political convictions until he played her perfectly.</p> <p>Portman did everything it took to get the characterisation right, Lazio told the Guardian, short of dressing up. \"He never wore a dress or a wig. He didn't go that far.\"</p> <p>Lazio calls Portman \"the quintessential debate prep expert\". He was supremely good at the job, Lazio says, primarily because he took it so seriously.</p> <p>\"He will spend countless hours listening and watching tapes of the person he is supposed to be playing. He is incredibly dedicated preparer.\"</p> <p>The power of televised debates to make or break candidates was made evident in the very first event of its kind. The debate between John F Kennedy and Richard Nixon in September 1960, in which Nixon appeared sweaty and ill-at-ease, is widely credited as having put Kennedy in the White House.</p> <p>Since then the job of preparing for the ordeal has developed into a central part of any presidential campaign. With it, the role of the sparring partner has similarly gained in prominence.</p> <p>In Obama's case, he will be calling on John Kerry, who made a failed bid for the presidency in 2004, to take on the role of Romney in his prep sessions. Three televised presidential debates have been scheduled this year, all during October, as well as one vice-presidential debate between the sitting VP Joe Biden and Ryan.</p> <p>Lazio said that Portman's strength as a debate prepper is that he had the ability to mimic the cadence and rhythm of a politician's voice and the pace and punch of their answers. That helped Lazio keep cool when he came to face the real Hillary Clinton in the flesh in front of the cameras.</p> <p>\"I've done debate prep myself and know how hard it is. It's not something you can just do. It requires the ability to think on your feet, and to get into the head of a person,\" Lazio said.</p>",
  "<p>To many they seem the outsiders at the Republican convention in Tampa: out and proud gay and lesbian delegates who just happen to be conservatives.</p> <p>But at a gathering being held by the <a href=\"http://www.logcabin.org/site/c.nsKSL7PMLpF/b.5468093/k.BE4C/Home.htm\">Log Cabin Republicans</a> to highlight gay or gay-friendly Republican political candidates, some insisted that they were still an integral part of the Republican party.</p> <p>\"We were invited here. In addition to being welcomed here, we want to be here,\" said Clarke Cooper, executive director of the Log Cabin group at a fancy reception held over finger food and cocktails at a coastal Tampa hotel.</p> <p>However, to many observers the plight of gay Republicans seems extremely difficult. Though gay marriage is increasingly common among young Americans, it has become a familiar bugbear for many Republican politicians.</p> <p>Some rightwing Republicans have made anti-gay statements, like when Minnesota congresswoman <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2014289/Michele-Bachmann-says-gays-Satan-homosexual-life-bondage.html\">Michele Bachmann famously said<br>homosexuality was \"part of Satan.\"</a> Many Republicans opposed letting<br>gays serve openly in the US military. And the official Republican platform to be adopted by the party this week \u2013 a platform replete with anti-gay rights language \u2013 aims to limit marriage to between one man and one woman, attacks Obama for supporting gay marriage, and supports plans for federal laws to keep gay marriage at bay.</p> <p>Cooper admitted that the platform was offensive to him, but tried to see the bright side. \"As abysmal as the platform language was, we were able to participate,\" he said. \"The negative language that was in there is not only divisive for certain issues, but it is not helpful in the wider context.\"</p> <p>But Cooper said he remained a Republican because he was a firm believer in the conservative values of small government and a muscular American foreign policy.</p> <p>The Log Cabin group does have allies, too. Andrew Langer, president of the Institute for Liberty, was at the party, and said conservatives had to welcome gay people into the movement as a point of principle. \"It is a fundamental American virtue to leave people alone to their own devices. Gays have as much to fear from the Obama administration as anyone else. It is up to use to educate the rest of the movement as to the error of their ways,\" he said.</p> <p>There were some straight delegates there. Bob Dallas, a Republican delegate from Georgia, had come to the party to show his support and play down the importance of social issues in the party. \"Even a person who is married will not agree with their spouse 100% of the time,\" Dallas said.</p> <p>Being a gay Republican is still not easy, however. David Lamando, an openly gay New Jersey resident, has every intention of voting for Romney in November. \"Not so much on the social issues, but on the fiscal issues Romney is right,\" he said.</p> <p>But he gets upset by the party's stance on gay rights. \"It is very discouraging. I am from a liberal area, and I get a hard time from people for being a gay Republican,\" he said. \"It will change. Younger people are different. People who don't support gay marriage are on the wrong side of history,\" he said.</p> <p>For now, though, it is difficult to see the Republican, still dominated by its powerful evangelical base, embrace gay rights any time soon. After all, even at the Log Cabin party, journalists were instructed very carefully not to take any pictures of those attending.</p>",
  "<p>Under the <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.d1695\" title=\"\">government's franchise plan for the NHS</a>, shareholders and equity investors will use the service's logo as a Trojan horse to prise open the budgets of other countries' health systems and to front up their unethical, fraudulent and inequitable activities. However, prospective customers will be buying neither NHS services nor the NHS model of care.</p> <p>Since 1948, the NHS has been the model for universal heathcare on the basis of need and free at the point of use. In 2012, <a href=\"http://www.marcuschown.com/THE%20HEALTH%20AND%20SOCIAL%20CARE%20ACT%20-%20Briefing%20-%20Marcus%20Chown.htm\" title=\"\">parliament in England passed a law effectively ending the NHS</a> by abolishing the 60-year duty on&#xa0;the government to secure and provide healthcare for all.

In contrast, Scotland and Wales will continue to have a publicly accountable national health service.</p> <p>NHS hospitals and services are being sold off or incorporated; l<a href=\"http://socialinvestigations.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/nhs-privatisation-compilation-of.html\" title=\"\">and and buildings are being turned over to bankers and equity investors</a>. RBS, Assura, Serco and Carillion, to name but&#xa0;a few, are raking in billions in taxpayer funds for leasing out and part-operating PFI hospitals, community clinics and GP surgeries that we once owned.</p> <p>Strangled by PFI debts and funding cuts, NHS foundation trusts compound their problems by entering into joint ventures. The great NHS divestiture, which began in 1990 with the introduction of the internal market and accelerated under the PFI programme, now takes the form of franchising, management buyout and corporate takeovers of our public hospitals. Virgin has been awarded \u00a3630m to provide services to vulnerable people and children in Surrey&#xa0;and Devon. Circle has been given the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-15436685\" title=\"\">franchise for NHS hospital Hinchingbrooke</a> and is now struggling to contain its debts. London teaching hospitals are merging to give them greater leverage for borrowing and cuts.</p> <p>As for public accountability, there is none. Commercial contracts are redacted so that crucial financial information is not in the public domain. Government departments and companies refuse to release the necessary information on the grounds of commercial confidentiality and <a href=\"http://www.corporatewatch.org/?lid=4251\" title=\"\">allow companies to sequester their profits in offshore tax havens</a>. NHS staff transferred from the public to the private sector see their wages and benefits eroded. But all this is nothing compared with what is in store for patients.</p> <p>In the new world it will no longer be possible to measure coverage or fairness. Former NHS hospitals, free to generate half their income from private patients, will dedicate their staff and facilities to that end, making it impossible to monitor what is public and what&#xa0;people are paying for.</p> <p>The belief that markets distribute resources more efficiently is the basis of regional economic agreements like the European Union as well as policies imposed on developing countries by the World Bank and IMF. Britain led the way, starting with gas, water, telecoms and railways. By 2004, the whole of Whitehall was committed to putting corporations in control of what had formerly been publicly administered services. This year it is the turn of the NHS.</p> <p>Loss of public control means higher cost and fewer services, as we have learned from the toxic record of the US corporations which are now part of England's new healthcare market and helped design it. Billing, invoicing, marketing and advertising will add between 30% and 50% to costs compared with 6% in the former NHS bureaucracy.</p> <p>Patient charges will become commonplace. Fraudulent billing and embezzlement will become endemic. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/15/business/hca-giant-hospital-chain-creates-a-windfall-for-private-equity.html?pagewanted=a\" title=\"\">Take HCA, one of the largest and most profitable US chains</a> and controlled by private equity firms including Mitt Romney's Bain Capital.

  "<p>Germany and France have moved on Monday to bury months of squabbling over how to resolve the euro crisis by agreeing to form a joint policymaking body to create a more integrated economic and fiscal policy in the eurozone and structure a new banking supervision regime.</p> <p>The announcement of the accord in Berlin came as Germany's leading business confidence index showed a greater than expected dip due to fears of the impact of the euro's travails on German exports. It is the fourth month in a row that German business confidence has fallen.</p> <p>The German and French finance ministers, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble and Pierre Moscovici, said the aim of the new working group was to produce common policies on how to deal with Greece, Spain and Italy. as well as mapping out longer-term strategies. The Germans hope this will conclude in a full-scale political union within the eurozone.</p> <p>\"We want to take joint decisions,\" said Sch\u00e4uble, a Christian Democrat of the German chancellor Angela Merkel's party. Moscovici, a French Socialist, said the countries needed to \"deepen our consultations\".</p> <p>The eurozone's two biggest economies have been at odds since the election of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande as French president in May. He has sought a policy shift geared to growth and jobs, while Berlin, dominating the EU response to the crisis for almost three years, has emphasised austerity, savage spending cuts and debt reduction. Monday's announcement was an acknowledgment that eurozone crisis management will be paralysed if the two biggest players remain at loggerheads.</p> <p>The announcement came as the German headline Ifo index of business sentiment fell in August to its lowest level since March 2010, dropping to 102.3 from 103.3 in July. However, the current assessment component of the index dropped by less than expected, from 111.6 to 111.2.</p> <p>The Berlin talks kicked off what promises to be a fraught and frantic few weeks in crisis management after the August holiday lull. Policymakers at the European Central Bank (ECB) are to meet next week amid expectations their president, Mario Draghi, could unveil plans to intervene in the bond markets to try to cap Spain and Italy's borrowing costs.</p> <p>The following week, the European commission is to reveal new proposals for banking regulation and supervision that are likely to give extensive powers to the ECB.</p> <p>The Franco-German accord came as Spain revealed its ailing economy did worse than thought over the past two years. The country's statistics office said its economy grew by just 0.4%, rather than 0.7%. It said a recession the previous year shrank the economy by 0.3% rather than 0.1%, meaning Spain's economy has declined by about 4.5% in the four years since a housing bubble burst and the credit crunch hit in 2008.</p> <p>With economists seeing a further 2% fall in GDP over the next two years, predictions that Spain is in the middle of a lost decade now look to be accurate. The economy will not return to its 2007 size until the second half of this decade.</p> <p>Thousands of small Spanish savers are expected to be forced to take losses of up to 80% on preference shares in those banks when the government passes a new banking law forced on it by Brussels and the ECB in the coming days or weeks.</p> <p>Many bought the shares after being cold-called by bank managers who told them they were risk-free deposits. The government is also expected to set up a \"bad bank\" to absorb toxic real estate assets left on balance sheets by bust real estate developers.

  "<p>When the rest of the convention is cancelled, what are you left with?</p> <p>Newt Gingrich started his seminar on \"Obamacare\" with a tribute to Neil Armstrong. Of course he did. The non sequitur spoke to the improvisational nature of this would-be first day of the Republican National Convention, hijacked by forces of nature \u2013 a category that should include Newt Gingrich's hair, in addition to his ego. </p> <p>Grinch was speaking at \"Newt U\", an official but ancillary event that escaped cancellation. Similar seminars and panels made for a full-enough day that the absence of a larger structure wasn't entirely obvious. One noticed it more in the aimlessness of those who bothered to show up to the convention hall. Reporters, mostly, but also vaguely shell-shocked delegates, craning their necks at the \"DC celebrity\" transplants (I'd name them, but then I'd have to explain who they are) smiling gamely into cell phone cameras.</p> <p>The metaphors available in Tampa to explain the current state of the Republican party are easier to grasp than the purpose of the convention itself. (Losing a day with no admitted effect on the end result only suggests that there was at least 25% too much convention to begin with.) The RNC's first day was shut down because of a chaotic event beyond the organizers' control? Let me show you some Ron Paul supporters. And then there are the gusts blowing convention-goers off course: surely Todd Akin is responsible for that. Finally, the driving rain: no longer able to rely on the old \"culture war\" verities to energise both base and swing voters, the GOP finds itself in a fluid situation \u2013 trying to catch and carry water in the palm of its hand. </p> <p>Romney has wisely refused to pick much of a fight on gay marriage and preferred to major on the economy, but how can you get people riled up to vote out the incumbent when your own nominee's favorite prop is a white board and not a flag?</p> <p>Gingrich's Obamacare seminar and moon landing celebration was a part of \"Newt U\", an attempted co-optation of whatever energy is left to Gingrich's insurgent campaign and a further example of Republicans' quest for a cohesive secular theology to match the more uniform religious one. Newt U is intended to \"examine the convention's daily themes in greater detail and give delegates an opportunity to dive deeper into those issues\": issues, yes; proposed policies, no.</p> <p>Hampered by Romney's own refusal to make his agenda more specific, the Gingrich panel focused on largely disingenuous criticisms of the Obama healthcare plan (such as describing the transfer of Medicare funds as a \"cut\") and left alternate proposals lofty and ambiguous.</p> <p>\"What if we took the '200,000 apps for the iPhone' model,\" Gingrich asked, and \"asked [Americans] to develop a better solution for Medicare.\" I wonder if that would be based on Angry Birds or Twitter. (Gingrich is a noted Apple fan and obviously enamored of what he probably thinks of as their free-market approach; I guess he hasn't read their end user agreement.)</p> <p>Arguments about Medicare are attractive because of the voter base potentially swayed, but it's actually a tangential issue for the large majority of Americans. The Romney campaign has admitted that every day they're not talking about jobs is a day that they lose, but they cannot agree on a way to talk about the economy beyond disparaging Obama's handling of it.</p> <p>\"I think the fiscal issues we face are so big and so overwhelming that there's little reason to focus on the other things,\" <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/27/us/politics/republicans-worry-about-keeping-factions-reined-in.html?pagewanted=all&amp;gwh=6CAB6E29952BD87D6ACE4822BBFCCE9B\">House Representative Jeff Flake told the New York Times</a>.

For anyone.\"</p> <p>Yes, Republicans are making heavy weather of this election season.</p>",
  "<p>Republicans are working on emergency plans to salvage their convention as tropical storm Isaac hurtles towards New Orleans, with party officials acknowledging that their carefully-choreographed event could face further disruption.</p> <p>The Republicans, still haunted by the fatal delays of President Bush in the aftermath of hurricane Katrina exactly seven years ago, would find it difficult to push ahead with their convention in Tampa in the event of serious flooding.</p> <p>Organisers said for the first time that the remaining days \u2013 Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday \u2013 may also be disrupted by Isaac hitting the Gulf coast. They expressed hope that the convention, with a reshaped schedule, would go ahead, but conceded that in a worst-case scenario the whole thing might have to be cancelled.</p> <p>Under that scenario, Romney would express regret over events in New Orleans and say that human life takes precedence over politics.</p> <p>Senior Republicans, including Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal and Florida governor Rick Scott, have pulled out of the convention to focus on leading the Isaac response in their states.</p> <p>Isaac has already affected the Republican convention, an event intended as a launchpad for Mitt Romney's bid for the White House and an occasion normally attracting guaranteed primetime television spots.</p> <p>It should have kicked off on Monday, but the Republican national committee cancelled the first day amid severe weather warnings for Florida. However, as delegates gathered for the convention's formal opening followed by its immediate adjournment, the National Hurricane Center lifted the tropical storm warning for Tampa.</p> <p>Romney, who remains in New Hampshire rehearsing his conference speech, expressed surprised when asked about the convention being cancelled. \"Got a great convention ahead,\" he told the Washington Post.</p> <p>The Republicans intended to use the event to criticise Barack Obama's economic record and build up Romney's profile. But television networks are now sending teams to New Orleans, and focus on the imminent storm will almost certainly deflect attention from the convention.</p> <p>RNC chairman Reince Priebus admitted that the convention would have to compete with the weather story. \"It's a terrible thing. We certainly hope it doesn't develop into something stronger. We have to tell the Mitt Romney story and prosecute the president on what he promised, what he delivered. And at the same time you have to report on this storm, because it is something that people need to know about,\" he told NBC.</p> <p>The convention was officially opened on Monday but went into recess again after less than 10 minutes, and was postponed until Tuesday. Priebus, speaking at the podium in front of mainly journalists, expressed hope that those in the path of Isaac will be kept out off harm's way.</p> <p>Priebus also launched a political gimmick, a clock ticking for the duration of the convention that will total the amount of federal debt accumulated during that time. There was also a prayer and a short video of Romney expressing his love of America.</p> <p>Isaac could also give Barack Obama an opportunity to make a high-profile intervention. Having learned the lessons from Bush, Obama would almost certainly head directly for New Orleans in the event of serious damage.</p> <p>Obama called the governors of the states in the path of the storm to offer government assistance.</p> <p>The compressed convention schedule caused another high-profile cancellation: entrepreneur and Romney backer Donald Trump was due to have a speaking slot on Monday, but was bumped from the schedule.</p> <p>The conservative talk show host Mike Huckabee has also pulled out. The former Arkansas governor had been due to speak Monday and has not been rescheduled for later in the week.</p> <p>Huckabee's non-appearance, though, could prove a blessing for the convention organisers, because he has been one of the few high-profile Republicans to speak out on behalf of the party's senatorial candidate Todd Akin, who is at the centre of the rape/abortion row. If Huckabee had spoken, it would have renewed a controversy the party has been trying to shove to the sidelines.</p> <p>The seventh anniversary of Katrina will fall on Wednesday. New Orleans has a special resonance for Republicans because of Bush and because of ideological arguments about the level of federal intervention, and this would make it difficult for the party to continue with a raucous convention gathering.</p> <p>Rich Galen, a Republican strategist, said the tone of the conference might have to be changed. \"You can tone down the happy-days-are-here-again a bit,\" he told AP.</p> <p>Russ Schriefer, who is organising the convention schedule, told a press conference on Monday the party is not yet seriously looking at extending into Friday. \"We are planning on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. If the weather changes in a way that we have to make some changes \u2026 it's a hypothetical question, so I don't want to answer it in that way.\"</p> <p>Schriefer said that the schedule was being reorganised to accommodate speakers who had been dropped. Speakers had been asked to shorten their speeches.</p> <p>\"There's a weather event. We all know that,\" Schriefer said, responding to a question about the impact of the storm heading towards New Orleans.</p> <p>Various parties and events on the sidelines of the convention were cancelled on Monday, though Tampa was experiencing little more than heavy rain.</p> <p>A protest organised for Monday was among the events to suffer. Only a few hundred protesters turned up out of a predicted 5,000, and the organisers blamed the warnings about Isaac.</p> <p>The focus on the storm had one positive for the Republicans, distracting attention from a report that New Jersey governor Chris Christie had turned down the vice-presidential slot because he thought Obama was likely to win the election.</p> <p>Christie is lined up to be the keynote speaker, with the primetime television slot, on Tuesday night. According to the New York Post, Christie refused to give up his governorship to be Romney's running mate.</p> <p>Christie, though a popular figure, would have annoyed the conservative wing of the party because he is less hardline than many Republicans over guns and abortion.</p> <p>Romney campaign officials denied the story.</p> <p>Romney may have considered Christie early on when his strategy was to win over independent swing voters but when he shifted to a new strategy of cementing the party base then his eventual choice, Paul Ryan, is a better fit.</p>",

Photograph: Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Naomi Wolf:</strong> It was the gay rights movement in San Francisco in the mid-seventies that really imprinted me. It was so powerfully visual \u2013 you would see the change from one year to the next. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, one was aware of homosexual people, of course, but even in San Francisco, they lived on the margins. Nothing like militancy was attached to that concept \u2013 more like shame, or something that mainstream culture just didn't know how to grapple with. Then Prop 6 came along, and a rightwing spokeswoman made the case that gay teachers were trying to indoctrinate gay kids. By this time I was in middle and then in high school, I was very aware of the active debate around this \u2013 and aware that it sounded nuts, even to a 14-year-old \u2013 and finally I saw how gay men and women seemed to be coming out because of their outrage around this targeting and this legislative attack. It triggered a wave of militancy and a wave of what can only be called pride; suddenly <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Castro,_San_Francisco\">The Castro</a> was packed with beautiful young men wearing chaps and leather vests and little else, milling around in the sunshine in an atmosphere that mingled erotic validation with an emerging excitement of becoming a political force. It was so powerful to see a group of people able to wake up and say no to existing reality, to challenge the dominant debate, to assert their own identities, and to organize.</p> <p>I was also made aware of the importance of rhetoric and symbolism in activism, and also the importance of spokespeople. Many activists on the left have an antipathy toward organizing, toward hierarchies and toward spokespeople who use the media to advance their message. Indeed they seem reflexively to believe that the media always corrupts, as does hierarchy. I saw the opposite in the gay rights movement. I watched people like Harvey Milk become stars, and use their celebrity to help and support others, and lobby for their own constituencies. I also saw how when gay people organized as a voting bloc \u2013 just as how when Chinese immigrants, who were often very poor, organized as a voting bloc \u2013 they became powerhouses in the politics of the city council, and reset the city's agenda to reflect the needs of their people. I saw how fast power drained from old-money, Waspy interests who had run SF forever, as soon as these new groups organized, and as soon as they could run their own candidates accordingly. This made me be as obsessive as I am about the idea of teaching whoever wants change \u2013 from Occupy to the Tea Party to anyone, anywhere \u2013 how to do so. It is not pie in the sky, not rocket science. The gay lobby and the Chinese lobby took over big chunks of the government of my hometown, and local democracy benefited hugely as a result of this representation of otherwise silenced constituencies.</p> <p>There was a final lesson for me from the gay rights movement. I have been wrestling for a long time over the issue of why sexual freedom is political and in what ways it is important. This group's insistence that being able to tell the truth about their sexual identity was about something far bigger and more important than just sex has been hugely influential to me, and made me link sexual identity and freedom for everyone to revolutionary issues like democracy and human rights.</p>",
  "<p>A political love triangle, awkward accordion dances, public kissing and a tweet of revenge: it was only a matter of time before Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's stranger-than-fiction private life became a French publishing phenomenon.</p> <p>A clutch of books set to hit the shelves explore the \"psychodrama\" of Hollande's relationship with his partner, the journalist Valerie Trierweiler.</p> <p>Nicolas Sarkozy's second and third marriages spawned their fair share of bestsellers, but what is damaging for Hollande is that he promised a break from Sarkozy's style of putting his love life on display. Now writers are taking the president to task for not keeping his word.</p> <p>The key book is Entre deux Feux, by the journalists Anne Rosencher and Anna Cabana, out on Wednesday. It traces the background to the day in June when Trierweiler tweeted her support for a dissident Socialist running for election against S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, publicly displaying her animosity towards Hollande's ex-partner. It forced the love triangle on to the front pages and \"opened the door to the president's bedroom\", the authors write.</p> <p>The book describes how Trierweiler began a secret relationship with Hollande as early as 2005 when she was a political journalist covering the Socialists. Royal called her into her office to warn her off. \"Everyone says you're Fran\u00e7ois's mistress, it's unbearable for me,\" she reportedly said.</p> <p>The book claims that Hollande's transition to his new relationship was messy, and that he considered trying to get back together with Royal in 2007 after she ran for president. Trierweiler is depicted as anxious and lacking self-confidence, in the words of one Hollande ally . She is advised by a mentor to drink half a glass of wine before going on set to present her TV show. Hollande orders his entourage to reassure her, but apparently doesn't manage to reassure her himself.</p> <p>The former minister Rachida Dati points out how Sarkozy always held his wives' hands in public, whereas Hollande doesn't touch Trierweiler. During the campaign, if Trierweiler felt she wasn't getting enough attention from Hollande she would \"dramatically disappear\", the book claims, leaving Hollande asking: \"Where's Valerie?\"</p> <p>The book reveals that she sent her famous tweet from her office in the Elys\u00e9e palace while Hollande was in his own office in another wing, after berating him by phone over his support for Royal. Such was Trierweiler's resentment that she once told a Hollande biographer she would only talk to him if he didn't mention the other woman. Royal claims in the book that Trierweiler has banned Hollande from ever making her a minister.</p> <p>Another book, La Favourite, a journalist's open letter to the \"dangerous\" Trierweiler, is already out, to be followed next week by L'Ex, about Royal, The Heart of Power. Trierweiler's own book of photos from the campaign, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande President: 400 days behind the scenes of a victory, has been a sales flop.</p>",
  "<p>Philip Barlow does not recognise the descriptions of Mitt Romney, as a cold, stiff CEO. As Romney's church counsellor when the Republican presidential hopeful was a bishop in the Mormon church in Boston, Barlow saw him administer <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/16/us/politics/for-romney-a-role-of-faith-and-authority.html?pagewanted=\">to the emotional and practical needs</a> of all his flock.</p> <p>\"It forces you to become intimately involved in the lives of people of all economic and racial backgrounds,\" he explains. \"People would come to him with problems: a son who's strayed from the faith, a daughter with a drug problem, marriage difficulties. I was there with him in his home, every Saturday, talking about how he would handle these problems. In his personal life he's not stiff at all.\"</p> <p>So why, given such low favourability ratings and a reputation for being out of touch, doesn't Romney draw on that experience to show his capacity for empathy?</p> <p>The gamble, explains Barlow, the Arrington chair of Mormon history and culture at the Utah State University in Logan, may be too great. \"It risks inviting more scrutiny of Mormonism. The political upside is it humanises the candidate. The political downside is it Mormonises the candidate.\"</p> <p>Now, Romney and his campaign team have decided that the risk is worth taking. This week, as Republicans gather in Tampa, Florida, to formally nominate Romney as their candidate for the White House, he will publicly embrace his religion. A Mormon bishop will perform the opening invocation on Thursday, the day of Romney's speech, and campaign officials have hinted that he will talk openly about his Mormonism.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/michael-gerson-romney-should-not-be-afraid-to-highlight-his-faith/2012/08/06/c6a6e728-dff1-11e1-8fc5-a7dcf1fc161d_story.html?hpid=z3\">recent Washington Post column</a> Michael Gerson argued that given Romney's performance so far, the downsides aren't that great. \"Take away Romney's religion and you are left with Harvard, Bain and various corporate boardrooms,\" he wrote.</p> <p>\"Mormonism has been one of the main stages for his leadership, as well as the main setting where he has displayed humanity. \u2026 Mormonism is the reason for Romney's rectitude, the explanation for his wholesomeness, the key to understanding his persona. Without it, he would merely be a stiff, able management consultant. Romney's reticence on religion leaves a large personal and biographical gap.\"</p> <h2>'Mormons understand why he keeps a distance'</h2> <p>The emergence of <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/mitt-romney-on-the-cusp-of-making-major-mormon-history/2012/04/11/gIQAWesuAT_story.html\">a viable Mormon candidate</a> for the presidency has posed significant challenges both for the candidate and the Mormon community, the overwhelming majority of whom are members of the Church of Latter-day Saints.</p> <p>Mormons still very much see themselves as outsiders. A <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/Christian/Mormon/mormons-in-america-executive-summary.aspx#family\">Pew poll in January</a> revealed that almost half believe they face a lot of discrimination \u2013 in fact they perceive themselves to be more discriminated against than black Americans \u2013 and more than two-thirds think their fellow countrymen do not regard Mormonism as part of mainstream America.</p> <p>That sense of alienation is well founded. <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/Politics-and-Elections/Romneys-Mormon-Faith-Likely-a-Factor-in-Primaries-Not-in-a-General-Election.aspx\">Barely half of Americans</a> believe Mormonism is a Christian religion, and in an open-ended question posed in a poll last November the word most frequently used to describe Mormonism was a \"cult\".</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/polls/postpoll_022607.htm\">poll in 2007 revealed</a> that people were less likely to vote for a Mormon presidential candidate than a candidate who was female, black, twice divorced or a smoker. Only Muslims and atheists fare worse.</p> <p>Most Americans now know Romney is Mormon. Indeed they <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/Politics-and-Elections/2012-romney-mormonism-obamas-religion.aspx \">are more comfortable</a> with his faith than they are with Obama's (though that seems to be because a large percentage still believe he is a Muslim).</p> <p>But the group that is least comfortable with his religion \u2013 white evangelical Christians \u2013 also happens to be a crucial part of the Republican base. When he ran in 2008 opponents in South Carolina <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2104316,00.html\">someone sent fake Mormon holiday cards</a> claiming they were from him and an email from an unknown source with the subject line \"Mitt Romney has a family secret he doesn't want you to know\" that encouraged recipients to trust their \"dark suspicions\" about Mormonism.</p> <p>\"It's like quicksand for him,\" explains one long time observer. \"He can't just go there a little bit. Put your foot in and you're sucked in to the whole thing. I think most Mormons understand why he keeps a distance from the church.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395272977\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/27/1346087471648/mitt-romney-mormons-010.jpg\" alt=\"mitt romney mormons\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Three-year-old Dean Call holds a sign for Romney at  a rally in Columbia, South Carolina, in January.

America is poised to pit its first black president against its first Mormon contender. They're <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2011/06/05/mormons-rock.html\">calling it the Mormon Moment</a>. But it doesn't seem to be a moment of unqualified joy for Mormons.</p> <p>\"There is a sense of ambivalence in the community,\" explains Paul Reeve, associate professor of history at the university of Utah. \"It signals to some Mormons that we might no longer be considered a pariah faith but instead might finally be arriving. A Mormon candidacy gives a sense of acceptance and legitimacy in mainstream American life. But there is also concern about the level of scrutiny it has brought to their faith. Every wart from Mormon history is being examined so closely it worries them.\"</p> <p>The media, they say, tend to concentrate on polygamy \u2013 which the church renounced in 1890 and only 2% of Mormons now endorse \u2013 and \"magic underwear\" \u2013 symbolically significant temple garments worn by many church members after they've taken part in an endowment ceremony. More than a third of Mormons think news coverage of their religion is unfair and more than half that they are badly portrayed in films and television. </p> <p>\"Things that are sacred to us become this awful caricature,\" says Neylan McBaine, founder of the <a href=\"http://www.mormonwomen.com/\">Mormon Women's Project</a>. \"The church membership is really feeling the weight of the Romney candidacy.\"</p> <p>If there is excitement in the Mormon community at Romney's candidacy it certainly seems muted. A <a href=\"http://utahdatapoints.com/2012/08/who-thinks-governor-romneys-candidacy-is-good-for-the-lds-church/\">recent poll found</a> that 79% of Mormons in Utah, including more than half of Democrats and almost two-thirds of independents, felt his candidacy was \"a good thing\" for the Mormon church.</p> <p>But driving around Utah \u2013 where Mormons comprise more than half the population \u2013 for a few days I saw only a handful Romney bumper stickers and not a single poster. By this time four years ago black America was awash with t-shirts casting Obama alongside Martin Luther King and Malcolm X \u2013 essentially iconising a living candidate \u2013 and psychedelic posters proclaiming hope and change. Nevertheless, Barlow believes that while the ambivalence is real, \"the dominant side of that equation is the pride. Mormons are not by and large a demonstrative people so it's a quiet pride.\"</p> <h2>Joseph Smith's visits from the angels</h2> <p>Every religion has its story. A narrative through which believers make sense of their faith. From the loaves and fishes to the creation story, religion is filled with tales of the fantastic. Every Sunday, Catholics are supposed to drink the blood and eat the flesh of Christ.</p> <p>Christians and Jews are taught that Moses parted the Red Sea and led the Israelites to the promised land. Hindus have Hanuman, the monkey god who carried an entire mountain covered with the sanjivini herb to save the life of Lakshmana. Some take them literally; for others they are metaphors. If they weren't fantastical, there would be precious little to put your faith in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395272978\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/27/1346085892837/Mormon-smith-romney-001.jpg\" alt=\"Mormon smith romney\" width=\"220\" height=\"350\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mormon prophet Joseph Smith</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Church archives/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mormonism is no different. The religion started with Joseph Smith, a man in western New York who had many visions. During the 1820s he said an angel visited him and lead him to a buried book of golden plates inscribed with a Christian history of ancient American civilizations.</p> <p>It was one visit among many; he also claimed that the angels of Peter, James, John and John the Baptist visited him and endowed him with a range of priesthood authorities. Claiming that by the \"by the gift and power of God\" he translated the 500 pages in two months he published the Book of Mormon, organised the Church of Christ and was hailed as a prophet. The president of the church is still considered a prophet and God's spokesman to the world.</p> <p>Smith's small but growing band of followers were chased out of New York and settled in Kirtland, Ohio, from which they were expelled, pushing them south and west to Jackson County, Missouri. Attempts to lay down roots there were scuppered when the governor issued a \"Mormon extermination order\" insisting they must \"be treated as enemies\".</p> <p>They went north to Illinois where after a few years Smith and his brother were slaughtered by a mob. Brigham Young then took over and lead them westward where they settled in what was then Mexican land and would later become the state of Utah.</p> <p>\"Even though more than a century has passed and we don't face anything like that level of persecution now there's a live nerve ending in the Mormon consciousness that's informed by that history,\" explains Barlow, \"that does make us more sensitive to being misrepresented.\"</p> <h2>In five elections, no Democrat has broken 35% in Utah</h2> <p>Mormons were not always considered conservative. The church drew significant fire for its opposition to slavery although it went on to exclude people of African descent from both the priesthood and participation in temple ceremonies until 1978. \"Through the 19th century there was an attempt to insulate themselves from capitalism through communalism,\" says Reeve.</p> <p>In the post-war era the church comprised a significant portion of Democrats. In 1964 Lyndon Johnson won Utah; in 1960 Kennedy got 45%. But with the late '60s came the sexual revolution: women's rights, abortion, gay liberation and divorce. With little doctrinal room for manoeuvre on these social issues Mormons increasingly identified with the Republican Party.</p> <p>In the last five elections no Democratic candidate has broken 35% in Utah. \"Mormons have their idiosyncratic dimensions that are particular to the faith but they are all part of a piece of that broader American story,\" says Barlow.</p> <p>Today there are 14 million Mormons worldwide, less than half of whom live in the US. Comprising just 2% of the US population they are no monolithic group. One in 7 is not white; slightly more than that are Democrats or lean that way; a quarter do not live in the west; and one in 10 is divorced or separated. Still, broadly speaking, they are far more likely to be conservative, educated and white than the country as a whole and more than half live in just three states: Utah, California and Idaho.</p> <p>For a group who feel excluded from the mainstream they have fared remarkably well in most sphere's of American life. Democratic senate majority leader, Harry Reid, is Mormon as is the author of the Twilight vampire series, Stephanie Meyer, and former Fox News anchor, Glenn Beck, the CEO of Jet Blue Airways, David Neeleman and the Marriott family that owns the hotel chain. (Romney is named after the Marriott founder, John Willard Marriott. Romney's first name is Willard. Mitt is his second.)</p> <p>Indeed, Romney is not the first Mormon to run for president. He's not even the first in his family \u2013 his father George, the former governor of Michigan, ran in 1968 \u2013 or the only one this year \u2013 John Huntsman, who bowed out early, is also Mormon.</p> <p>Greg Smith, a senior researcher for Pew forum on religious and public life, says the group Mormons most resemble in their feelings and attitudes are American Muslims. \"Both groups feel they are discriminated against and not fully accepted by mainstream society. But both groups are still doing quite well and are happy with their lives and generally optimistic about the future.\"</p> <p>In Armitstead Maupin's Maybe the Moon the dwarf protagonist, Cady Roth, explains her conciliatory impulses thus: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"When you're my size and not being tormented by elevator buttons, water fountains and ATMs, you spend your life accommodating the sensibilities of 'normal people'. You learn to bury your own feelings and honour theirs in the hope that they'll meet you halfway. It becomes your job, and yours alone, to explain, to ignore, to forgive \u2013 over and over again. There's no way you can get around this. You do it if you want to have a life and not spend it being corroded by your own anger. You do it if you want to belong to the human race.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Every minority candidate, it seems, must at some point during their campaign allay the fears of the majority if they want to be part of the electoral race. Obama did it in Pennsylvania as he <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/obama-ferraro-wright-postracial-meets-racism\">sought to quell fears about his pastor</a>, Jeremiah Wright.</p> <p>In 1960 John F Kennedy <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16920600\">addressed his Catholicism</a> in a now famous speech in Houston. \"I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute,\" he said. \"I am not the Catholic candidate for president. I am the Democratic Party's candidate for president, who happens also to be a Catholic. I do not speak for my church on public matters, and the church does not speak for me.\"</p> <p>Back in 2007 Romney claimed he wanted to give a speech on his faith but was dissuaded from doing so by his team. \"The political advisers tell me: 'No, no, no, it's not a good idea. It draws too much attention to that issue alone.'\u2009\"</p> <p>But shortly before the primaries four years ago he felt he had little choice. Having once been a frontrunner in Iowa back then he was losing ground to the lay preacher and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee. Given that more than half of Iowa caucus-goers in 2008 described themselves as born-again or evangelical the Romney campaign felt they had no option but to address it.</p> <p>Shortly before Christmas in 2007 Romney <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16970082\">spoke at the George HW Bush library</a> in College Station, Texas. The speech was revealing on many fronts. Like Kennedy almost 50 years earlier he emphasised that if elected he would be representing America not his church.</p> <p>\"Let me assure you that no authorities of my church, or of any other church for that matter, will ever exert influence on presidential decisions. Their authority is theirs, within the province of church affairs, and it ends where the affairs of the nation begin,\" he said.</p> <p>He also acknowledged and accepted his vulnerability on the issue. \"Some believe such a confession of my faith will sink my candidacy,\" he said. \"If they are right so be it. But I think they underestimate the American people.\"</p> <p>But then came a moment when Romney had to say something that Kennedy would never have had to say (although Obama, for different reasons has also had to stress): that he considers himself a Christian. \"I believe that Jesus in the son of God and the saviour of mankind,\" he said.</p> <p>And while Kennedy saw American secularism as the bridge between his minority faith and politics, Romney argued that secularism was becoming a barrier between all faiths and politics, first caricaturing and then condemning those who advocate a strict separation between church and state.</p> <p>\"They seek to remove from the public domain any acknowledgment of God,\" he said. \"Religion is seen as merely a private affair, with no place in public life. It is as if they are intent on establishing a new religion in America \u2013 the religion of secularism. They are wrong. Freedom requires religion, just as religion requires freedom.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395272979\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/27/1346087068275/salt-lake-city-010.jpg\" alt=\"salt lake city\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Mormon Temple is the centerpiece of Temple Square in Salt Lake City.

But it also revealed his particular challenges as a Mormon in the Republican Party in this moment. Unlike Obama, who has generally faced racialised attacks from outside his own party, Romney is most vulnerable to anti-Mormon attacks from within his own party. In the audience that day were, among others, the president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, Focus on the Family founder James Dobson, and the Reverend Lou Sheldon of the Traditional Values Coalition.</p> <p>They were pleased by the speech. But not everybody was convinced. In October a prominent Texas pastor, Robert Jeffress, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/08/us/politics/prominent-pastor-calls-romneys-church-a-cult.html\">branded Mormonism a cult</a> and suggested Romney was not a proper Christian not long after introducing Rick Perry. \"This isn't news,\" he said. \"This idea that Mormonism is a theological cult is not news either. That has been the historical position of Christianity for a long time.\"</p> <p>\"It is only faith in Jesus Christ, in Jesus Christ alone, that qualifies you as a Christian,\" Jeffress said. \"They embraced another gospel, the Book of Mormon, and that is why they have never been considered by evangelical Christians to be part of the Christian family.\"</p> <h2>Conservatives with no alternative will vote for Romney</h2> <p>The trouble, as is always the case with prejudice, is to determine to what extent people are talking about who Romney is and to what extent they are talking about what he does. There are plenty of reasons why right wing conservatives might oppose him that have nothing to do with his denomination.</p> <p>The fact that he has taken a range of positions on abortion, gun control and provided a prototype for Obama's health-care plan would not endear him to them regardless of his religious beliefs. During his College Station speech Romney insisted that ditching his Mormon faith for something more palatable would not win him much support: \"Americans do not respect believers of convenience. Americans tire of those who would jettison their beliefs, even to gain the world.\" </p> <p>The trouble is <a href=\"http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/Gingrich-website-Romney-flip-flops/2012/01/30/id/425959\">many on the right feel</a> that while he has remained true to his religion, he has done precisely this in his politics over the years.</p> <p>\"I think people's views on a generic anonymous Mormon can be quite different to their views about a particular candidate that they are familiar with,\" says Reeve.</p> <p>The question is whether the religious differences really will translate into any significant effect come polling day. \"Romney's biggest problem was in the primaries,\" says Professor John Green, a political scientist in religion and politics at the University of Akron in Ohio. \"When evangelicals have a conservative alternative, in say, Mike Huckabee or Rick Santorum they take it. But the part of the country that would most concerned by voting for a Mormon would be even more concerned by the prospect of a second term for Obama. So they'll vote for him.\"</p> <p>And that includes pastor Jeffress. \"Given the choice between a Christian-like Barack Obama who embraces non-biblical principles like abortion and a Mormon like Mitt Romney who embraces Bible principles, there's every reason to support Mitt Romney in this election,\" <a href=\"http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/04/16/anti-mormon-pastor-endorses-romney-because-obama-opposes-the-bible/\">he said</a>. \"I think as more evangelicals are aware of what this president is doing, I think they will turn out and vote. Not for partisan reasons, but because he opposes biblical principles.\"</p>",
  "<p>Over the next week, as Republicans gather for their national convention in Tampa, Florida, we can rest assured that the Obama epithet game will be in full effect. He's a tax-and-spender; he's an inveterate expander of federal power; he's weakened America in the world; he was born in Kenya and might be a Muslim (well, you'll only hear that if Republicans pull an Akin). What they likely won't hear is the truth about why the US economy remains in mediocre shape, and who is to blame for this distressing situation.</p> <p>For that, most Americans would be wise to simply turn off the TV and pick up a copy of Michael Grunwald's exceptional new book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-New-Deal-Hidden-Change/dp/1451642326/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top\">The New New Deal: The Hidden Story of Change in the Obama Era</a>. Grunwald, a correspondent for Time magazine, has written what is likely the single best book to date on the inner workings of the Obama presidency and the $800bn stimulus measure (or American Recovery and Reinvestment Act) that Grunwald persuasively argues is Obama's greatest political achievement.</p> <p>That conclusion may seem odd to the casual observer of US politics. In the more than three years since it passed, the stimulus has been tagged as a boondoggle that exploded the debt and did precious little to turn around the country's economic malaise. It is derided en masse by Republicans and largely ignored by Democrats.</p> <p>But, in exhaustive detail, Grunwald points out how everything you think you know about the stimulus is wrong. While the Recovery Act created 2.5 million jobs, stopped the country's economic hemorrhaging and launched a weak recovery, its long-term, transformative impact is the real story. </p> <p>According to Grunwald, the stimulus measure was \"the biggest and most transformative energy bill in history\", and \"the biggest and most transformative education reform bill since the Great Society\". It was also a \"transformative healthcare bill\", the \"biggest foray into industrial policy since FDR\", the \"biggest expansion of antipoverty initiatives since Lyndon Johnson\", and \u2013 ironically, for a president oft-accused of raising taxes \u2013 the \"biggest middle-class tax cut since Reagan\". It rebuilt bridges and paved roads; weatherized and retrofitted homes; and spurred the move toward high-speed rail.</p> <p>It pumped an extraordinary $90bn into the clean energy industry, propelled the US battery industry and expanded rural broadband adoption. It revamped the country's unemployment system, tackled the challenges of homelessness, began the digitizing of millions of health records, and fostered education reform through the innovative Race To The Top program. It doubled renewable power generation, significantly expanded solar production and basically birthed the country's transition to a low-carbon economy.</p> <p>In short, while Republicans blast the bill as socialist government spending run amok, the stimulus has, in just a few years, transformed America and laid the foundation for future economic growth. To paraphrase Vice-president Biden, that's \"a big fucking deal\". So, the question is: why is the first we're hearing about it?</p> <p>Although Grunwald is himself a card-carrying member of the mainstream media, he takes his fellow scribes to task on this point. By focusing on picayune stories of fraud (the stimulus was, amazingly, almost completely graft-free) and \"gotcha\" reporting on projects that sounded like boondoggles, major media outlets have largely ignored the bill's seismic impact. That, three and a half years after it was passed into law, most Americans simply have no idea what the Recovery Act wrought is a truly damning indictment of the US media.</p> <p>The other part of this story comes from across the aisle and involves the Republican party, which, with the exceptions of three senators (Collins, Snowe and Specter), voted unanimously against the bill, and which, since it passed, has repeatedly lied about its impact. Grunwald's book makes an argument that many Democrats have believed for years: that Republicans' opposition to the Recovery Act was less about ideological hostility and more about partisan politics. In a desperate effort to avoid giving Obama a political win \u2013 and cultivating the notion that it was he not Republicans who was acting as a partisan \u2013 the GOP brazenly opposed stimulus initiatives once previously supported by the party.</p> <p>Even after Obama filled the Recovery Act with Republican-favored tax cuts (which, while stimulative, are a lot less stimulative than actual government spending), it had little impact on swaying Republican senators. At the same time as Republicans were railing against the Recovery Act, they were applying for stimulus funds for their own constituents: GOP vice-presidential pick Paul Ryan is a case in point. Of course, this blanket opposition to any use of public funds as economic stimulus has continued unabated since then.</p> <p>Among those who ended up supporting the bill, the story isn't much prettier. Susan Collins is perhaps the sorriest example. A moderate Maine Republican, Collins has long cultivated an image as the sort of Republican who could reach across the aisle and work with Democrats. But in Grunwald's book, she, like virtually all of her centrist brethren, comes across as cynical, craven and more interested in casting a pose as a serious, thoughtful moderate than in actually being serious and thoughtful.</p> <p>Her position as a potential aye vote for the Recovery Act, gave Collins extraordinary leverage \u2013 leverage she exploited. She adamantly opposed new school construction in the stimulus \u2013 not because she was necessarily opposed to the idea, but because it was an effective way for her to burnish her deficit-cutting credentials. For her, and for other moderates like Ben Nelson, Olympia Snowe and a whole swath of Senate \"centrist\" Democrats, forcing Obama to reduce the stimulus below a magical number of $800bn was all about their own personal political optics; it had little to do with what was best for the country. As Arlen Specter, another of the centrist crew, said at one point:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"A trillion seems scary. Even $900bn, it looks so big.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Hence the final agreed-upon figure of $800bn. Heaven help the country that in the midst of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression makes policy decisions based on such ridiculous rationales.</p> <p>The result was that additional monies for programs like Head Start, healthcare for unemployed workers, high-speed rail, even preparations for a flu epidemic, all of which would have softened the economic downturn or created new jobs, were sacrificially slaughtered at the altar of \"fiscal responsibility\". While it's pretty hard to argue that even a slightly larger stimulus would have moved the country dramatically out of the economic doldrums, reading about centrist senators from both parties demanding spending cuts without any rhyme or reason, and merely to ensure that the price tag was below a made-up number of $800bn, is stomach churning. After all, the lives of real people were being affected by the political posturing of these pusillanimous centrists. Obama's then chief of staff Rahm Emanuel summed it up best:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"It was all driven by Washington stupidity \u2013 not what the economy needed, just this arbitrary number of 800 [billion]. If you were at 801, you were unreasonable. If you were at 799, you were a very thoughtful person.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>All of this bring us to the present day \u2013 and why the debate over the stimulus still matters for 2012. This presidential election represents a clear choice between two very different visions about the role of government. On the one hand, there are Democrats who accept the Keynesian notion that counter-cyclical spending is essential for spurring growth and job creation in times of economic distress. On the other hand, there are Republicans who view tax cuts <em>and tax cuts only</em> as the tool for spurring economic growth and additionally are supporting massive non-defense spending cuts to the federal budget.</p> <p>Yet, the last four years have shown us the results of such contrasting policies. Until the stimulus ran its course, the US economy grew and unemployment went down, albeit haltingly. This didn't happen at a pace to put a serious dent in the downturn, but if anything, that appears the result of too little stimulus, rather than too much.</p> <p>Once Republicans were able to impose their will on the country, via Senate obstructionism and then control of the House of Representatives, they put in place more tax cuts and blocked any further government spending (even on traditional items like unemployment benefits for laid-off workers). The result will be of little surprise to austerity-bound Britons: stagnant economic growth and frustratingly high economic numbers. Indeed, the GOP's austerity policies <em>have</em> resulted in hundreds of thousands of public-sector workers losing their jobs.</p> <p>Republicans, not surprisingly, like to blame President Obama for the poor state of the US economy, but in reality, the US is living today under a Republican economy \u2013 one that comprises low taxes and curbed spending. The results speak for themselves. This is ultimately why Grunwald's book should be required reading for America's undecided voters (as well as everyone else). If you want to know what the best plan for turning around the US economy is, he has it covered.</p>",
  "<p>Egypt's new leader, Mohamed Morsi, is due to visit Iran this week, marking a significant step towards rapprochement between the two countries and the start of a new Egyptian initiative to broker a peace settlement in Syria.</p> <p>Morsi's participation at the summit of the Non-Aligned Movement of developing countries in Tehran on Thursday will mark the first visit by an Egyptian leader since the 1979 Islamic revolution and a substantial departure from the foreign policy of the deposed dictator Hosni Mubarak.</p> <p>Morsi will reportedly stay only a few hours in what will be a largely symbolic trip, but it is intended to lay the foundations for a new regional effort to stem the deepening violence in Syria.</p> <p>Tehran, meanwhile, is presenting the summit as proof of the failure of western efforts to isolate Iran.</p> <p>Morsi, who came to office two months ago, has said he wants to form a Syria contact group made up of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Iran, bringing together the most powerful Sunni backers of the Syrian rebels with President Bashar al-Assad's only significant ally in the region, the Shia regime in Tehran.</p> <p>Before his Tehran trip, Morsi is due to hold talks in Beijing on Tuesday with the Chinese government, which has stood alongside Russia in opposing punitive measures against the Assad regime at the UN security council.</p> <p>\"Part of the mission is in China, part of the mission is in Russia and part of the mission is in Iran,\" Morsi's spokesman, Yasser Ali, told the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/27/world/middleeast/egyptian-president-seeks-regional-initiative-for-syria-peace.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">New York Times</a>. It is not clear whether or when Morsi will visit Russia as part of the initiative. Western officials say any attempt to broker peace in Syria will hinge on the role of Moscow, the regime's main sponsor and arms supplier. They argue that without Russian pressure, Assad is unlikely to give up his efforts to crush the insurgency.</p> <p>However, Peter Harling, a Syria expert at the International Crisis Group, said in light of the failure of the UN and Arab League to make diplomatic progress, any new effort was worthwhile when hundreds of casualties were being reported each day.</p> <p>\"Given how desperate the situation is and the need for some movement on the political front, it's a welcome initiative,\" Harling said. \"In the past, the US opposed any participation of Iran in the contact group, but it makes sense to include Iran in any negotiated transition. Tehran has much to lose and it can cause damage in the region if it is excluded. It is just diplomatic common sense.\"</p> <p>Assad met Iranian officials in Damascus on Sunday and was quoted on Syrian state media as saying his regime would carry on fighting \"whatever the price\".</p> <p>The intensity of the conflict has dramatically increased in recent weeks, culminating in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/26/syrian-regime-accused-daraya-massacre\" title=\"\">government offensive on Daraya</a> on the south-western edge of the capital city.</p> <p>Various opposition claims have put the death toll in the town at between 300 and 600, many of them civilians, from three days of heavy shelling and then a ground attack on Saturday, when troops and allied militiamen went from door to door.</p> <p>If the reports are verified, it would be the worst massacre of the 17-month long conflict, which began in March last year with initially peaceful anti-regime protests.</p> <p>Official restrictions on independent press coverage make it hard to confirm the casualty figures but independent witnesses spoke of seeing scores of bodies in Daraya. Video footage which emerged on Monday showed mass burials.</p> <p>More video footage from Damascus on Monday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/aug/27/syrian-rebels-down-helicopter-damascus-video\" title=\"\"> showed a Syrian military helicopter plummet to the ground in flames</a>. The opposition claimed it was brought down in fighting with government forces in the capital. The Syrian official news agency confirmed the crash but gave no details.</p>",
  "<p>A curtailed Republican national convention will be symbolically called into session for just 10 minutes on Monday in a largely empty hall, after a tropical storm forced party officials to cancel the first day.</p> <p>GOP officials were scrambling to re-schedule the four-day event into three days, as their plan to cast Mitt Romney as a determined leader came under threat from the weather.</p> <p>Aides also want to introduce Romney as a family figure, with Romney's wife Ann taking a prime speaking role on Tuesday night to counter the Democrat attempts to brand him as a ruthless asset-stripper.</p> <p>Romney is trying to balance the celebrations of his presidential nomination with being mindful of the ghost of hurricane Katrina and the stain George Bush's handling of it left on the Republican party. The tropical storm, which seemed likely to be upgraded to a hurricane, could strike the Gulf coast nearly seven years to the day that Katrina hit.</p> <p>After scrapping the convention's first day, planners late on Sunday announced a three-day program and leaner agenda. But they would not speculate whether the storm would force a second postponement or any additional changes.</p> <p>\"We're moving forward, but we are going to be nimble,\" Republican national committee chairman Reince Priebus said.</p> <p>News networks announced they were relocating some of their crews: CNN said it was sending star anchor Anderson Cooper to New Orleans, and Fox News said it would send Shepherd Smith there, too. GOP officials worry about the prospect of \"split screen\" coverage \u2013 images of revelry in Tampa juxtaposed with hurricane damage in the Gulf states.</p> <p>Virginia governor Bob McDonnell said Sunday that despite competition from the storm coverage, he expected independent voters in particular to tune in to hear Romney's speech on Thursday night. He told ABC: \"I think we'll still get a fair amount of attention, and the message will be good.\"</p> <p>After the 2005 Gulf coast devastation, Republicans were so sensitive to the political danger around hurricanes and the appearance of partying at a time of trouble that they delayed the start of their national convention by a day in 2008 when Hurricane Gustav bore down on the Gulf, 1,200 miles away from where delegates were gathering in St Paul, Minnesota.</p> <p>Beyond the safety and image concerns, Isaac presents another problem for Romney: it allows Obama to show leadership. As forecasts grew grim, Obama dispatched the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) to assist, and the White House said the president was closely monitoring the storm.</p> <p>\"The president also told the governor to let him know if there are any unmet needs or additional resources the administration could provide, including in support of efforts to ensure the safety of those visiting the state for the Republican national convention,\" the White House said Sunday.</p> <p>Mindful of the danger of appearing to put politics before safety, vice-president Joe Biden cancelled a campaign swing through Florida on Monday and Tuesday.</p> <p>Republican strategists suggested Romney celebrate without going overboard.<br>\"You can tone down the happy-days-are-here-again a bit,\" said Rich Galen, a veteran Republican consultant in Washington. \"Maybe you don't have the biggest balloon drop in history.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Federal Reserve needs to take action now to bring down the jobless rate, a top Fed official said on Monday.</p> <p>Charles Evans, president of the Chicago Federal Reserve, said the central bank should not wait for more data. \"I don't think we should be in a mode where we are waiting to see what the next few data releases bring. We are well past the threshold for additional action; we should take that action now,\" he told reporters at a seminar at the Hong Kong Bankers Club.</p> <p>Last week the Fed released minutes from its last meeting a the end of July which showed its members were increasingly concerned about the slowdown in the US's fragile economic recovery. At their previous meeting in June the minutes showed only \"a few members\" thought further stimulus would likely be needed.</p> <p>Evans said that without a change in policy, the unemployment rate, now at 8.3%, was unlikely to fall below 7% before 2015 at the earliest.</p> <p>Last year the Fed launched a securities buying programme known as Operation Twist aimed at bringing down longer-term interest rates. Evans appeared to be giving support to a similar move. \"It is time to take even stronger steps,\" he said.</p> <p>His comments come ahead of a speech Friday from Fed chairman Ben Bernanke at the Kansas City Fed's annual gathering of policymakers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. That speech will be closely watched in Washington as well as by the financial markets. The economy is central to the 2012 election cycle and any move by Bernanke could trigger a furious backlash from Republican critics.</p> <p>After its last meeting the Fed signaled it was increasingly concerned about the apparent slowdown in the US recovery. Strong jobs growth over the winter collapsed in the spring. It has since recovered but remains historically weak compared to the job growth after previous recessions.</p> <p>Next Friday the Labor Department will release non-farm payroll figures for August \u2013 the closely watched monthly survey of US employment. Last month the US added 163,000 new jobs, higher than the 100,000 gain expected by economists but not enough to bring down the unemployment rate.</p> <p>The Federal Reserve Open Markets Committee, which sets Fed policy, meets after the release of those figures on September 12 and 13. That meeting is seen by economists as the last before the election at which the Fed in likely to act.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/27/taliban-execute-civilians-at-party\" title=\"\">killing of 17 people</a> by Taliban insurgents in Musa Qala, the <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/10-afghan-soldiers-killed-checkpoint-attack-043510948.html\" title=\"\">deaths of 10 Afghan army personnel</a> in a separate, large-scale assault in Helmand, and the <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/27/world/asia/afghanistan-violence/index.html\" title=\"\">killing of two US soldiers</a> by an Afghan national army recruit could be dismissed as just another bloody day in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Alternatively these gruesome events, taken together, might sensibly be seen as another urgent warning to neglectful western politicians that their policy of gradual, go-slow withdrawal is rapidly unravelling. It is a warning they may ignore at their peril.</p> <p>Barack Obama and David Cameron have set a departure date for Nato forces of 2014. But the deteriorating security situation, the rank unreliability or underperformance of large sections of the Afghan army and police, and the fearful persistence of the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban may yet force their hand, turning ragged retreat into slow-motion rout.</p> <p>Western leaders would prefer to ignore Afghanistan. It hardly features in the US presidential contest between Obama and Mitt Romney.</p> <p>In Britain, news of each soldier's death is received with muted official regret. President Hollande of France has already washed his hands of the affair. The war has become an embarrassment, a hangover from the Bush-Blair days. More pressing issues, closer to home, now dominate.</p> <p>\"Remember the war in Afghanistan?\" <a href=\"http://walt.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/08/14/the_lessons_of_Afghanistan\" title=\"\">asks Stephen Walt</a>, professor of international relations at Harvard, in Foreign Policy magazine:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"You know: It was the 'good war,' fought in response to al-Qaida's attack on 9/11 and the Taliban's refusal to turn them in, and subsequently justified by (1) the need to prevent future terrorist 'safe havens,' (2) the desire to liberate Afghan women, (3) the imperative to bring democracy and modern governance to an underdeveloped tribal society, and (4) as always, the need to preserve American 'credibility'.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Walt suggests none of these objectives has been attained. Afghan policy is heading for the rocks, if it is not already wrecked on them, and there is scant chance that Nato will leave behind a functioning state, let alone a liberal democracy, Walt suggests.</p> <p>If the politicians are asleep at the wheel, oblivious to the dangers, the American military is not. Hence the visit to Kabul last week of the Pentagon's top soldier, General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the joint chiefs. His meetings with President Hamid Karzai and other top officials focused on the massive upsurge in so-called \"green-on-blue\" attacks by Afghan soldiers or police on Nato personnel.</p> <p>These \"stab-in-the-back\" attacks, allegedly orchestrated by Mullah Omar, the top Afghan Taliban leader, have reached epidemic proportions this year, with 42 foreign troops killed and dozens more injured. Eleven US soldiers have died in the past week alone. Dempsey is understood to have discussed counter-measures including an extraordinary plan for the Afghan security force, in effect, to spy on itself.</p> <p>\"Soldiers must feel that they are under the full surveillance of their leadership at all levels,\" the Afghan army chief of staff, General Sher Mohammad Karimi, said <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/afghans-to-spy-on-own-troops-to-stop-insider-attacks/2012/08/20/e9f93ea8-eafd-11e1-866f-60a00f604425_story.html\" title=\"\">in an interview</a> with the Washington Post after meeting Dempsey. \"Initially, it will have a negative impact on morale, but we have to do something. We have to look seriously at every individual.\"</p> <p>But Nato commanders cannot avoid evidence that the rise in such attacks may reflect a deepening, wider hostility to the continuing foreign occupation, anger at perceived cultural affronts (such as <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/feb/25/world/la-fg-afghanistan-koran-20120226\" title=\"\">the Qu'ran burning episode</a> earlier this year), and the continuing toll of civilian casualties caused by both Nato and the Taliban.</p> <p>According to a 2011 Pentagon analysis, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-23/-green-on-blue-attacks-show-need-for-smaller-afghan-army.html\" title=\"\">quoted by Bloomberg</a>, only about 11% of the attacks are the result of Taliban infiltration:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The majority had other causes, particularly disputes or grudges between coalition and Afghan forces \u2026 Among the causes identified in interviews with hundreds of Afghan soldiers and police officers was anger over everything from US convoy procedures, night raids and civilian casualties to widespread cursing and shooting of livestock. Even something as elemental as how to urinate while on patrol was a cultural flashpoint. US personnel, the same study found, had 'extremely negative' views of their Afghan counterparts.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, Karzai and his officials blame infiltration by agents acting for Pakistan and Iran for much of Afghanistan's security problems, including Taliban atrocities like the Musa Qala beheadings. They argue their neighbours' spy agencies are intent on undermining efforts to \"stand up\" the Afghan security forces, as part of a wider struggle for power and influence in a post-2014 Afghanistan.</p> <p>Pakistan has its own Taliban problem, of course, as <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-South-Central/2012/0816/Taliban-attack-Pakistani-air-base-ahead-of-reported-military-operation\" title=\"\">a recent attack</a> on a military base at Minhas demonstrated. The Pakistani military is said to be preparing a big new offensive in North Waziristan, a base for militants operating in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. Such an offensive is likely to greatly exacerbate Afghan security problems, at least in the short term.</p> <p>When they return from their holidays, western leaders urgently need to refocus attention on Afghanistan \u2013 before the situation spins fatally out of their control.</p>",
  "<p>Was Neil Armstrong really a hero? I have been pondering the question since it was announced that the first man on the moon had <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/aug/26/neil-armstrong-passing-us-yearning-glory\" title=\"\">died at 82</a>. Not out of malice \u2013 Armstrong himself was modest enough to dismiss such labels, and his family called him a \"reluctant hero\" \u2013 but because the very notion of a hero has been so distorted.</p> <p>A man who rescues a dog from a shallow pond is routinely dubbed a hero. Olympic gold medalists, skilled and dedicated athletes to be sure, have been called heroes virtually without discrimination in London this month. (Can dressage ever be heroic? Discuss \u2026) It is tempting to say that greater, truer heroism will be on display when the Paralympics begin this week, as Amelia Gentleman <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/23/paralympians-british-military-rehabilitation\" title=\"\">reminds us here</a>.</p> <p>Barack Obama, a thoughtful (too thoughtful?) US president, had no hesitation in calling Armstrong \"among the greatest of American heroes, not just of his time but of all time\". He could hardly do otherwise in an election year tinged with nostalgia for America's 20th-century triumphs and uncertainty about its future. The White House has come under pressure to give Armstrong a state funeral. I doubt if the self-styled \"nerdy engineer\" would have wanted that.</p> <p>Armstrong was never comfortable with the cold war politics or the publicity, happy to become a professor of engineering in his native Ohio in later life, and in no way vainglorious. That was an admirable side of the American character of which we have lost sight as the bogus cult of celebrity has taken hold.</p> <p>It is, of course, the antithesis of the ancient world's vision of a hero. Achilles was not a good man, but a selfish one who sulked in his tent, a loner, an outsider, an individualist. His exceptional martial skills made him a hero, little less than a god, in a world where martial prowess outshone even the intellectual brilliance of the Greeks. Aristotle taught Alexander and it was the latter whom posterity most revered.</p> <p>Fashions change. Heroes can be religious or intellectual (Cato was a hopeless politician, but a gallant republican hero) as well as military or political. They can also be great explorers. Clearly, Armstrong was not a Christopher Columbus, a Ferdinand Magellen, a Francis Drake or a Captain Cook. They were men whose personal vision, skill and leadership charted new worlds in ways that profoundly affected mankind.</p> <p>The lunar cul-de-sac is highlighted <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/aug/26/since-neil-armstrong-manned-spaceflight\" title=\"\">in today's Guardian</a> by Lord Martin Rees, the astronomer royal, and <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/article3519282.ece\" title=\"\">in the Times</a> (paywall) by another academic, Prof Gerard DeGroot, author of Dark Side of the Moon: The Magnificent Madness of the American Lunar Quest. Both remind readers that the last men to visit the moon \u2013 Harrison Schmidt and Eugene Cernan \u2013 did so as long ago as 1972, three years after Armstrong.</p> <p>After that, what? To kids today the landings are as remote and as puzzling as the Egyptian pyramids. The awkward truth is that robots could have done the job more cheaply and safely, as one is currently doing on Mars. Kennedy was told as much. But the Russians were racing to grab the first moon rock by robotic means (their rocket crashed), and the White House knew the symbolic power of sending a human outside our own world, even if it was just to the familiar, barren rock in our backyard. Trouble was, they didn't have a proper strategy for following it up. Cautious politics soon prevailed.</p> <p>Does it matter? I suspect it does. When the Ming dynasty recalled the great Chinese fleet that had been exploring the world in the 1420s, it left the job to the piddling little ships of primitive European states that went on to a world domination that is only now ending. Striving matters. In the 1960s the US was struggling with social and economic conflict at home and the Vietnam war abroad. Barely 24 hours before the moon landing \u2013 people forget this \u2013 Senator Ted Kennedy accidentally drove his car over Chappaquiddick bridge, resulting in the death of a young staffer.</p> <p>Armstrong's small step provided a welcome distraction, a moment of clarity and wholesome success that has not been repeated. His role in Nasa's achievement was as the designated frontman for a team effort, guided by the work of \u2013 did I really read this figure? \u2013 as many as 400,000 Americans. His name and qualifications came up on the rota, an immensely experienced test pilot with a calm temperament under pressure, the right stuff to lead a mission into the known unknown.</p> <p>Does that fact deny him heroic status in terms that fail the Achilles test or \u2013 in our own times \u2013 by comparison to a Mandela, a monstrous Mao or even Churchill, individuals who by sheer force of will, ability and character diverted the course of history? Gerard DeGroot is happy to call Armstrong \"a genuine Homeric hero\", and on reflection I must conclude he's right, for three reasons.</p> <p>One is that many \u2013 not all \u2013 heroic achievements depend on harnessing the talents of others. Sir Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay did not reach the summit of Everest in 1953 without a lot of help. Even the intrepid action man Sir Ranulph Fiennes, whose exploits often strike me as being as barmy as a box of badgers, is not quite a one-man band. Horatio had a couple of mates at his elbows when defending the gates of Rome from Lars Porsena's troops, though he usually gets solo credit.</p> <p>Secondly, the weekend's retelling of the 1969 moon landing reminded us just how risky it was and how Armstrong's quick wits and calmness saved the day. The Eagle landing craft contained no more computer power than a modern washing machine, and was heading slightly off course for the rocks when Armstrong took over the controls manually. He landed with 20 seconds' worth of fuel, and got the Eagle back up again to rendezvous with Apollo 11. There was no backup plan, no way of rescuing the crew.</p> <p>Sitting in the co-pilot's seat with his spear (well, you never know, do you?), even Achilles might have been grudgingly impressed, though Armstrong's lack of melodrama would have annoyed him. And therein perhaps lies the clincher for Armstrong's heroic status. No boasting, no bullying, just a soft-spoken man who insisted he was only doing his job. They're the heroes we like best, yes?</p>"
