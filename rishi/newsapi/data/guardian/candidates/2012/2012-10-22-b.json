I have heard a lot of cynicism about whether or not they make a difference \u2013 or worse, that celebs are just attention-starved and will do anything to be recognized.</p> <p>When I hear the apathy, and worse the snark, it always makes me feel a little sick inside. Maybe because I am one of those people who has spent the last 20 years of my life using comedy to shine a light on creeps with power.</p> <p>So, as we come to the end of this election cycle, I thought it might be helpful to tell you what I have experienced when creative friends get together and make some noise. Change happens. It's not bullshit. It's not self-serving. It is awesome. </p> <p>It was a natural progression for me to go balls-out into politics as, over the years, my career has developed into more or less \"call-and-response\" comedy. If it happens, I am reacting either on stage, in videos or on radio and TV.</p> <p>So, when 2011 rolled around and the relentless attacks started on reproductive rights in congress and statehouses across America \u2013 oh, like 1,000 bills proposed to curb access to services from Pap smears to abortion \u2013 I decided to devote my creative energies touring the country doing comedy shows to benefit Planned Parenthood. I knew humor got people to sit up and take notice. I have built a career using comedy to expose hypocrisy.</p> <p>But now the rhetoric was escalating at warp speed. It seemed like each week, in every new town, some implausible piece of vaginal invasion legislation was happening. So touring for Planned Parenthood seemed like a no-brainer. The shows were packed and I was helping raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for Planned Parenthood, all across America. </p> <p>Then, just when I thought the idiocy couldn't get any thicker \u2013 BAM! A panel of men were called before Congress to discuss whether religious institutions that employ secular people should be required to cover birth control in their healthcare plans.</p> <p>Sandra Fluke, a young law student at Georgetown University, one such Catholic institution, who was an advocate for having birth control included in these plans, was not allowed to speak before the panel. So, she took to the airwaves to address the issue. Her appearances on news programs caused a rabid anti-woman backlash, and she was labeled \"a slut\" and worse by the likes of radio talkshow muculent, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-201_162-1753947.html\">Viagrasaurus Rush</a>. </p> <p>In the heat of all of this, I got a Facebook message from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Plimpton\">actor and activist Martha Plimpton</a>, asking if I wanted to join forces and do something about all this \"slut\"-shaming.</p> <p>The idea was simple: create an advocacy group called <a href=\"http://www.aisfor.org/\">\"A is For\"</a> that has a few goals: first, to launch an amazing website with the most up-to-the-minute reproductive rights news, which could serve as hub for women and men to share their stories about why protecting reproductive rights is so important; and second, to raise money for the groups like pro-choice organization <a href=\"http://www.naral.org/\">Naral</a> and the Center for Reproductive Rights, which are fighting the big battles. Our logo would be a scarlet letter \"A\", reclaiming the symbolism of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scarlet_Letter\">The Scarlet Letter</a> and our hope was that women and men would wear the \"A\" proudly, announcing to the world: \" I am a sexual being, I support all aspects of reproductive health and I will not be shamed into silence about it.\"</p> <p>Last March, then, I ventured to LA and met with a group of amazing women Martha had assembled, and so we started making videos, making scarlet A's, and defining what our mission would be. And seven months later, we have women and men walking around all over the country wearing that scarlet A, proudly declaring their support for women's reproductive rights.</p> <p>But I also wanted to expand my reach and make some videos that address issues using the language I speak, that candidly combine truth and humor, and hit hard just what is at stake in this election. I was inspired by my pal <a href=\"http://sarahsilvermanonline.com/\">Sarah Silverman</a>, who, during the 2008 presidential election, made a huge difference in Florida with her video <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgHHX9R4Qtk\">\"The Great Schlep\"</a>, creating an amazing call to action, simply being her. No censorship, no worries about who it would offend, just Sarah: knowing and trusting that her hilarious voice and message would generate action. It did. </p> <p>And then, in 2012, she <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B5o6-qNk6Q\">scissored her dog</a> in the name of introducing to a whole lot of people who may otherwise have never learned about him a major GOP money-machine named <a href=\"http://seattletimes.com/html/politics/2019476367_apusbiggestdonorsrepublicans.html\">Sheldon Adelson</a>. And no one but Sarah would think of calling for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypRW5qoraTw\">arming the elderly in the name of exposing voter suppression laws</a>. People sat up and took notice. They laughed. Then they Googled. Then they got angry. Then they got active.</p> <p>I wanted to do that with my repro rights videos. I raised some money on <a href=\"http://www.indiegogo.com/reprorightspsa\">Indiegogo</a>, teamed up with the amazing creative team at <a href=\"http://revolutionmessaging.com/\">Revolution Messaging</a>, made six videos and launched <a href=\"http://www.ladypartsjustice.com/\">Lady Parts Justice</a>. </p> <p>Our first video, called <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbdTMK66tq4\">\"It's the Law\"</a>, is an uncomfortable, hilarious and real video about a law in some states that forces a woman to pay extra for a medically unnecessary vaginal probe that takes pictures of her womb before she can terminate a pregnancy. That video had 635,000 views in 72 hours. My inbox was flooded with questions asking whether the law was real, or saying that they were shocked to find out that laws like this exist; they asked us if we can please make more videos that expose other pieces of legislation which these creepy politicians are trying to pass.</p> <p>Some told me they hadn't realized how bad it had gotten and thanked me for the reminder. That was exciting. But when people asked where they could get more information on other awful laws proposed or passed, it felt pretty cool to say, \"Go to 'A is For'\", knowing all the detail was there.</p> <p>But now the assaults on sanity have started to feel like relentless cluster bomb attacks: seems like half of my day is spent slack-jawed staring at the news, gobsmacked as unqualified kook after unqualified kook keeps getting elected spouting things like <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/18/joe-walsh-abortion-exception_n_1983701.html\">women no longer die during childbirth</a>, or that <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/08/11/677051/meet-paul-ryan-climate-denier-conspiracy-theorist-koch-acolyte/\">the chunks of toxic bilge that spew from antiquated factories have nothing to do with our melting earth</a>, or maybe the weirdest of all, that more than a few folks, some of whom sit on the US supreme court, believe a <a href=\"http://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/elections-politics/press-releases/fact-sheet-mitt-romney-supports-dangerous-personhood-amendments-1155.htm\">bunch of cells in a woman's body</a> <em>and</em> <a href=\"http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/citizens-united-v-federal-election-commission/\">Walmart</a> are people. </p> <p>But when I talked to people about what affected them the most, it was not about a specific issue, rather the epidemic of how a lie gets repeated over and over again \u2013 and how the media seemed pretty lax at calling out the bull, and thus these lies were starting to become truths. Someone needed to correct the record. And who better to do that than comedians?</p> <p>So, in one phone call with comedian and fellow troublemaker <a href=\"http://thisweekinblackness.com/\">Elon James White</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.filmaid.org/joy\">FilmAid</a> executive director and make-it-happenist Liz Manne, we came up with the concept of \"Actually\". Our plan was make series of videos using clips of some of the most egregious political lies, and then we turn to our most trusted information sources \u2013 comedians \u2013 to correct the record. Each rebuttal starts with the word <a href=\"http://actually.org/#actually\">\"Actually\"</a>: the word that so many of us say right before opening a can of whoop-ass.</p> <p>We wanted to do it right, so to produce them, we called the folks at <a href=\"http://www.thegreatschlep.com/schlep-labs\">Schlep Labs</a> who had made all the wonderful videos Sarah Silverman had done. We pitched the idea to <a href=\"http://www.americanbridgepac.org/\">American Bridge</a> to see if they wanted to finance the project. They were in, and in less than a month, and for way less than the millions poured into rightwing political ads that push lie after lie, we had Rosie Perez, <a href=\"http://www.wkamaubell.com/\">W Kumau Bell</a>, Elon James White and <a href=\"http://www.illdoctrine.com/\">Jay Smooth</a> all doing amazing videos setting the record straight.</p> <p>The best part for me was that Sarah and I, who usually spend our limited time together laying in a hotel bed with a few dogs and some junk food, watching a Law and Order marathon, teamed up and took on that hideous notion that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYfJWybKCy0&amp;feature=youtu.be\">\"Corporations Are People.\"</a> Voila, <a href=\"http://actually.org/\">Actually.org</a> was born: a fact-checking website with added fun. Could there be a better public service?</p> <p>Now you have some answers about whether or not these celebrity ads work. They do wake people up, and using humor backed up with facts is an amazing one-two punch for re-energizing some folks who have been feeling deflated about politics. And there is one other thing you should know: many of the celebs you see in these ads face opposition from managers or agents who tell us not to step up because it may offend some conservative network executive, or alienate the viewers of certain cable channels. They warn we will be branded as partisan. </p> <p>Hell, I've already been branded as a whore and worse because I dare speak out about the radical notion that because women are sexual beings they should have all the access they need to affordable healthcare. I'll take \"partisan\".</p> <p>I tell you this because when you see ads where someone famous sticks their neck out for a cause, they are taking a risk that they may lose fans and work.</p> <p><em>Actually</em>, they do it because they believe in something greater than themselves. So, when you feel like shitting all over a celebrity for speaking out and taking a stand, remember they don't have to; they are chosing to do something for the greater good, and are willing to take a hit for it.</p> <p>All I ask is that if your first response to seeing a celeb talking about an issue is \"What an asshole\", think about what they are saying. Then, think again.</p>",

This is a dangerous situation that has set back the hope of peace in the Middle East and emboldened our mutual adversaries, especially Iran.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Had he been president, Romney would have blared his support for Iran's Green Revolutionaries in the summer of 2009.

President Obama shut down Bush's CIA \"black sites\" and prohibited the torture tactics Dick Cheney argues for to this day.</p> <p>Romney appears to favor the use of torture in some cases. His team of advisers includes figures from the Bush administration who were among the most aggressive advocates of torture.</p> <p>\"A Romney administration would risk a return to the immoral, illegal, and counterproductive policies of President George W.

But it is consistent with his public statements, in which he has criticized President Obama for ending the \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques,\u201d and has maintained, against precedent and common sense, that waterboarding is not torture.</p> <p>The Romney torture memo is unsigned, but was written by members of a committee of Romney national security advisers that included Steven Bradbury, Cully Stimson, David Rivkin, and Lee Casey. These may not be household names, but they should cause alarm among those who care about the United States\u2019 commitment to the rule of law.</p> </blockquote> <p>Read Cole on Bradbury's work for Bush <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/nov/08/election-2/?page=2\">here</a>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-508585ab58f96784ee2908d8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T17:43:07.664Z\">6.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Giant glaring metaphor alert:</strong> A blimp-like aircraft with a huge Romney ad on the side got into trouble in high winds in South Florida last night and crash-landed.</p> <p>\"After all it isn't every day you see something this large looming below the treeline,\" the reporter says, helpfully.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWo7G22zcEw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wWo7G22zcEw?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50857ef358f96784ee2908d7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T17:14:27.232Z\">6.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's one for the <strong>conspiracy theorists</strong>: the CBS affiliate in Arizona broadcast a graphic Friday afternoon showing that Barack Obama had been reelected president of the United States.</p> <p>The twist: the election hasn't happened yet.</p> <p>The explanation: the station was just practicing.</p> <p>The suspicious detail: why not practice with a graphic showing that Mitt Romney won?</p> <p>If you have the stomach for this sort of thing you can visit <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=11103719&amp;l=d0a2d0b7dd&amp;id=24718773587\">Sarah Palin's Facebook</a> page to sample the outrage, such as this witticism from commenter Jorge Lopez Jr: \"Goes right along with their name, 'see BS.'\"</p> <p>Michele Wallace of KPHO told <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2012/10/21/cbs-news-affiliate-calls-2012-presidential-race-for-barack-obama-weeks-ahead-of-election/#ixzz2A33rRQGU\">The Daily Caller</a> it was a mistake with a test graphic:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On Friday October 19th during a test of KPHO- CBS 5\u2019s election returns software we inadvertently aired a test graphic for about 15 seconds in an episode of Peoples Court.

Official campaigns and Super Pacs are spending record sums to saturate swing state airwaves \u2013 but neither side packs a killer punch, he said.</p> <p>\"Dukakis in a tank is still remembered. It was iconic. But now there's nothing that tugs at the heart strings, nothing that makes you laugh.\"</p> <p>Earlier this month the advertising count in Las Vegas, which is key to Nevada and its six electoral college votes, passed 73,000 so far this year, a national record. Including congressional commercials Nevada is up to an estimated 10,000 ads per week, with 98 different ads in rotation, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/16/us/politics/never-to-be-outdone-vegas-sets-record-for-political-ads.html?_r=0\">the New York Times reported on Monday</a>.</p> <p>All, said Rogich, to negligible effect. \"It's so overdone. I don't think it's impacting. None are memorable.\"</p> <p>That the Obama and Romney campaigns are waging all-out fundraising efforts for last-minute advertising blitzes suggests they believe otherwise. It will be left to political historians to decide the impact.</p> <p>Rogich, who worked with Roger Ailes and Lee Atwater on Ronald Reagan's 1984 campaign, as well as Bush's Sr's in 1988 and 1992, said the negativity of 2012 was hardly unprecedented. Vicious insults and calumnies flew since the days of Theodore Roosevelt and earlier. \"There has always been rancour; just now it's more visible.\"</p> <p>The problem, he suggested, was the accelerating cycle which compressed news and campaigns into ever faster, smaller clips.</p> <p>An exception to that rule was debates. Rogich's office is adorned with a handwritten note from the former boss he used to prep: \"By God, I've got it: 'Eye contact \u2013 smile \u2013 don't scratch'. Sincerely with thanks, George Bush.\"</p> <p>Rogich said Obama was talented but hamstrung. \"He's eloquent and has a great ability to articulate. But there's an annoyance to his cadence. If I was advising him I'd tell him to be conversational. He needs to talk to people.\"</p> <p>Romney, he said, had made a welcome move to the centre and would prove a pragmatic president if elected but still risked losing the vast majority of Latinos because of his party's anti-immigrant rhetoric. \"It sucks. We better find a reasonable immigration policy because in 30 years we'll have north of 70 million new Hispanic (voters). If we're still viewed as anti-immigrant from a perception standpoint then there won't be a Republican party.\"</p>",

  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/22/foreign-policy-debate-romney-obama-live\">third presidential debate tonight focusing on America's foreign policy</a> will probably not have much impact on the race, two weeks before election day \u2013 and with an electorate much more concerned about economic prospects close to home than when exactly did Barack Obama acknowledge that the Benghazi 9/11 attack was an act of terror rather than a spontaneous reaction to the anti-Islam video. Debate moderator Bob Schieffer's decision to devote half the debate to Middle East-related issues (two-thirds if you include also the 15 minutes on Afghanistan/Pakistan) may also seem rather disproportionate, while China, with its major influence on the US economy, is only to be discussed in the final segment. And the eurozone and Mexico, both arguably affecting ordinary Americans lives to at least as great a degree as the Arab uprisings, are not even in the line-up.</p> <p>But one issue to be debated in Boca Raton has the potential to play big in the election \u2013 just not the American one. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/22/barack-obama-israel-settlements-palestine\">Israeli politicians and strategists will be anxiously watching the third debate segment</a> (entitled Red Lines \u2013 Israel and Iran). But it won't be for any inkling of how Obama in his second term or a new Romney administration would handle Iran's nuclear project \u2013 they know that election rhetoric has little relation to foreign policy once the campaign dust settles. Besides, they are in daily contact with both camps in Washington and know the current thinking. Their concern is much more immediate.</p> <p>This will most likely be the last chance to hear a clear statement from either candidate, not only before Americans go to the polls on 6 November, but also in advance of Israel's general elections exactly two and a half months later. Never has an Israeli election been held so close to an American one, and the results of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/22/third-presidential-debate-swing-romney-obama\">electoral college</a> are likely to have major implications on the tone and perhaps the outcome of the Israeli campaign. The strategic teams of the major Israeli parties, Likud and its rivals from the center-left, will be on the lookout for any usable quote that demonstrates either closeness or the slightest of differences between either of the candidates and the government in Jerusalem. Depending on the identity of the victor in two weeks, these quotes will be used accordingly in the ensuing campaign.</p> <p>All the polling in Israel currently points to a clear victory for Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, with the coalition of rightwing and religious parties upon which he can rely for support winning at least 60% of the vote. The center and leftwing parties are at war among themselves and none of their leaders is seen as a viable challenger to Netanyahu. Each of the parties is trying to attack Netanyahu and Likud on a different front \u2013 social inequities, bellicosity on Iran, religious special interests, the deep-frozen peace process \u2013 but none of these seem for now potent enough to prise enough voters away from the Likud and its partners to break Netanyahu's coalition-lock (a third of Israeli voters describe themselves as centrists). </p> <p>American voters are in the position to give them a crucial lever.</p> <p>In a recent poll carried out by the Maagar Mochot polling company for Bar-Ilan University on Israelis' attitude towards America, 69% said that the United States is Israel's loyal ally, opposed to only 10% who disagreed. An even more overwhelming 93% of Israelis agreed that the close relationship with the US is crucial for Israel's security. This unanimity among the general public is reflected also in closed briefings with senior military and diplomatic officials, who refer to the alliance with the Americans as \"Israel's No 1 strategic asset\", bar none.</p> <p>But there is a slight cloud on this horizon. While 30% of Israelis believe that a President Romney would improve the two countries' relations, should he win next month, only 8% expect Obama to improve ties if awarded a second term. That doesn't mean Israelis dislike the president: 38% said in the poll that they have a positive attitude towards Obama; a similar proportion said they were neutral; and only 23% described their feelings towards him as negative. Just 15% feel he has been unfriendly to Israel during his first term. </p> <p>The great majority of Israelis do not seem to think that Obama has something against them, quite the opposite. This is despite the bombardment of anti-Obama propaganda they have been under for the last five years, ever since the foundation of free newspaper Yisrael Ha'Yom (Israel Today), a well-financed daily that has become the country's most widely-read paper. The slavishly pro-Netanyahu paper, founded and bankrolled by casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, has been telling readers, basically from its first edition, that Israel cannot rely on the pro-Palestinian Democratic party. This is despite the current administration deepening security coordination and intelligence-sharing with Israel and financing Israel's new missile-defense system, the Iron Dome.</p> <p>Adelson is estimated to have spent around $100m on his Israeli paper (political donations in Israel are capped by law, but a private newspaper is a convenient loophole). That is similar to the sum he has pledged the Republicans in their attempt to beat Obama. But it isn't just the mega-donor who connects Netanyahu to his GOP allies. Israel's prime minister, since the time he spent as a diplomat in the 1980s in the US, has been a trusted member of conservative circles.</p> <p>He shares much of their worldview and fiscal principles, is beloved of Christian evangelicals and in his first term in office (1996-1999) incessantly quarreled with Bill Clinton. The last four years have been spent openly differing with the Obama administration, first on freezing settlement-building, and when Obama eased on that, shifting focus from the Palestinian issue to Iran. Netanyahu did not miss a single opportunity to belittle Obama's attempts to dissuade Tehran from pursuing a nuclear weapon through diplomacy and sanctions.</p> <p>While Mitt Romney's reception in London this summer was hardly enthusiastic, on his next stop in Israel, he was accorded a head of state's welcome. And that included an intimate dinner with Prime Minister Netanyahu, each accompanied by his wife.</p> <p>To date, Netanyahu's forceful policy on Iran has not harmed his popularity with Israeli voters. At the same time, successive polls indicate that the majority of Israelis do not support a military strike against the administration's wishes. While the differences between Jerusalem and Washington have been widely reported, Israelis do not fear for now that the relationship is in any way at risk. An open rift could be a potential game-changer. </p> <p>It won't happen, of course, if Romney wins in two weeks: a Republican win could seal also Netanyahu's claim to electoral victory. Netanyahu would be free to bask in the shared glory after betting on the challenger when no one gave him a fighting chance.</p> <p>A re-elected Obama, freed from campaign restraint, is another matter. He wouldn't have to change his policy even, just adopt a more censorious tone towards Netanyahu for a few weeks. </p> <p>The prospect of re-electing a prime minister who is putting Israel's crucial strategic alliance at risk will make many Israelis think twice. Netanyahu, who is acutely aware of this possibility, has brought the elections forward to the earliest possible date, in the hope that two and a half months would not be enough time for Obama, facing the fiscal cliff, to launch new diplomatic initiatives.</p> <p>Over the last two decades, the Israeli electorate has swung back and forth between right-, left- and centrist-led coalitions six times. At present, the opposition seems too fractured and leaderless to win over the centrist voters and unseat Netanyahu in this election. But the prospect of diplomatic isolation could lend them a rallying call \u2013 and perhaps, the only slim chance they are going to get.</p>",
  "<p>Republican heavyweights are spinning the presidential foreign policy debate hours before it gets under way in an effort to portray Barack Obama as weak by accusing him of permitting a resurgent al-Qaida to regain ground in the Middle East. </p> <p>Senator John McCain, speaking at the debate venue in Boca Raton, Florida, said he gives Obama credit for the killing of the al-Qaida leader but otherwise he has a record of \"failed leadership\".</p> <p>\"I think all Americans given the president credit for the elimination of Osama bin Laden, and then he should take credit for the abject failure throughout the Middle East. Al-Qaida is on the return. Al-Qaida is resurgent throughout Iraq, Afghanistan, all of North Africa, Libya, Mali. They're returning because we're weak,\" said McCain. \"He overruled his military advisers time after time in Afghanistan and we're failing there. In Iraq, everything is unravelling.\"</p> <p>McCain sneered at Obama over his claim to have been \"leading from behind\" in some of his policies, such as last year's Nato attacks in support of Libya's revolution. </p> <p>\"I think he has projected a position of weakness and a position of a lack of leadership, as he calls it: leading from behind. How do you justify over 30,000 people being massacred in Syria, and I've heard him speak up on their behalf once? Once,\" he said. \"What has this administration done? Absolutely nothing. And, just as many of us predicted, it's beginning to spill over into Lebanon, into Jordan, into the other countries in the region and we are on the verge of a serious crisis.\"</p> <p>Senator Lindsey Graham struck a similar theme. He said that \"on paper\" a sitting president has an advantage in a foreign policy debate. But not Obama.</p> <p>\"There's a dangerous disconnect between the world as described by President Obama and as it actually exists. I want us to leave the mid-east but I want us to leave it safely and smartly. What we did in Iraq has been a nightmare. Iran is stronger, in terms of influence in Iraq, than ever. They've doubled the number of al-Qaida operatives in Iraq,\" he said. \"The mid-east is coming apart. Leading from behind is not working. If I were governor Romney I'd go through each country and tell you here's the state of play on the ground that needs to change. </p> <p>Graham said that if the debate goes well for Mitt Romney, it could seal his victory.</p> <p>\"The first debate was a game changer. Tonight's debate, if he does well, that could be the knockout blow. All trends are moving in the right direction. We just need more momentum for two more weeks,\" he said.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/22/foreign-policy-debate-romney-obama-live\">Follow along on our US politics live blog</a></p>",
  "<p>It's the crucial final debate of the 2012 presidential campaign, and one man may have every right to be anxious about how his performance goes down on Monday night. Not the candidates, but Bob Schieffer, the moderator.</p> <p>A common theme of the three debates so far has been the criticism moderators have faced for their performance \u2013 being variously accused of <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/05/jim-lehrer-on-debate-mode_n_1941335.html\">not interrupting enough</a>, <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2012/10/17/Crowley-interrupts-28-times-Romney\">interrupting too much</a>, and having invited <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2012/10/10/abc-news-scrambles-to-cover-up-barack-obamas-attendance-at-vp-debate-moderators-wedding/\">the wrong people to their wedding</a>.</p> <p>When Schieffer becomes the latest high-profile journalist to enter the lion's den on Monday night, he will open himself up to similar vitriol from Republicans and Democrats scrutinizing every second of the debate for signs of bias.</p> <p>The good news is, Schieffer has been here before. The veteran host of CBS's Face the Nation has been in journalism for half a century, and moderated presidential debates in 2004 and 2008. But even he might be surprised by some of the venom directed at contemporaries Jim Lehrer and Candy Crowley.</p> <p>Crowley, the chief political correspondent at CNN, was variously accused of having <a href=\"http://www.theblaze.com/stories/act-of-jouranlistic-terror-limbaugh-rips-candy-crowleys-moderator-performance/\">\"committed an act of journalistic terror\"</a> (Rush Limbaugh) to having committed an act similar to <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/video/2012/10/18/tucker-carlson-compares-cnns-candy-crowley-to-j/190724\">John Wilkes Booth assassinating Abraham Lincoln</a> (the Daily Caller's Tucker Carlson) when she fact-checked Romney in Tuesday's debate.</p> <p>ABC's Martha Raddatz, moderating the vice-presidential debate, faced inquiries into her <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2012/10/10/abc-news-scrambles-to-cover-up-barack-obamas-attendance-at-vp-debate-moderators-wedding/\">wedding in 1991</a>, where a certain Barack Obama was among the guests as a friend of her husband, Julius Genachowski. (Raddatz and Genachowski divorced in 1997).</p> <p>Lehrer, who arguably did not put in his best performance as he hosted his twelfth presidential debate, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/04/jim-lehrer-debate-sucked\">faced widespread criticism</a>, descriptions of his performance ranging from \"practically useless\" to \"a bit overwhelmed\".</p> <p>But Schieffer's huge experience reporting on Washington means he should certainly be well placed to chair Tuesday's debate in Boca Raton, Florida, and his easygoing demeanour should mean he is able to handle any criticism that comes thereafter.</p> <p>Schieffer, 75, grew up in Fort Worth, Texas, and attending Texas Christian University before serving in the US air force. He joined the Fort Worth-Star Telegram upon leaving the military, <a href=\"http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/top-stories/154064/schieffer-i-would-become-a-footnote-of-sorts-in-jfk-assassination-story/how\">with one of his first big scoops coming in 1963</a>, when John F Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas.</p> <p>Schieffer was the night police reporter that evening, and d<a href=\"http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/172893/how-2-twentysomething-journalists-brought-down-a-corrupt-kentucky-sheriff/\">escribed in an article for Poynter</a> how, amid the newsroom bedlam in the wake of Kennedy's shooting, he grabbed a ringing phone to find a woman ask: \"Is there anyone there who can give me a ride to Dallas?\"</p> <p>It was Lee Harvey Oswald's mother. Schieffer obliged, collecting Marguerite Oswald and driving her to the police station, where police took him to be a \"young detective\" and agreed to allow Schieffer to speak to the suspect. After waiting for six hours, an FBI agent finally asked Schieffer why he was there, only to be \"not amused to discover I was a reporter\".</p> <p>\"I never got that scoop but over the years there would be more stories to write about the Kennedys,\" Schieffer said. He moved from the Star-Telegram into local television and was later hired by CBS, first as a general reporter, then moving into national politics.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.star-telegram.com/2012/10/21/4351062/for-debate-bob-schieffer-has-the.html\">In an interview with his former newspaper on Friday</a> Schieffer lamented the fact that \"people pay too much attention to moderators\" in the current environment.</p> <p>\"We're like the umpires. You only hear criticism from the losing team,\" Schieffer said.</p> <p>\"These debates are not about what the candidates say. People are watching to judge character.</p> <p>\"I don't think it matters what the questions are about \u2013 what matters is how candidates answer. Do they seem in control? \u2026 I'm just there to help the viewers get a better understanding of who these people are.\"</p> <p>Schieffer has stayed with the political beat for over 40 years, first serving as White House correspondent, then chief Washington correspondent before becoming the anchor of Face the Nation in 1991.</p> <p>While it is \"an honour to be asked\" to moderate the debate, Schieffer <a href=\"http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/entertainment/television/a-qa-with-cbs-bob-schieffer-on-the-lynn-debate/nShRR/\">lamented the partisanship</a> in American politics in an interview with Florida's Palm Beach Post over the weekend.</p> <p>\"Now we have people who want news from a conservative slant or a liberal slant, and they go to different places. It's a rare thing when we get our information from the same place,\" Schieffer said, adding that was why it was so important that both sides can use the debates to see the opposing candidates on the same stage.</p> <p>\"Because the partisan divide is deeper than I ever remember it,\" Schieffer said. \"A deep, deep divide, and I've been in Washington 43 years.\"</p>",
  "<p>What would American life be like without Roger Ailes?</p> <p>Not immediately that different, which is why many people have wishfully thought his contract might not be renewed. The Fox News method \u2013 rancorous rightwing personalities with a carefully curated subtext \u2013 is a ratings-winning formula that would have continued. But soon enough, it would begin to pall (which is, of course, what the wishful have hoped for).</p> <p>There is an obsessional quality to the Fox formula when it's directed by Roger Ailes. This is auteur stuff. This is real trouble-making. His is a golden gut \u2013 not just for television but for provocation (of how many can that be said?). Whereas everyone else in television is worried about going too far, Ailes is diabolically turning the country upside down.</p> <p>By all success measures, Roger Ailes may be the one person in America who most deserves to keep his job. And indeed, after a protracted period of negotiation \u2013 which likely will have made him the highest-paid person in television \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2012/10/19/roger-ailes-signs-deal-to-stay-at-fox-news-through-2016/\">last week</a>, News Corp, Fox's parent, renewed his contract for another four years: right through to the next presidential election, over which he will, once again, have vast and undue influence.</p> <p>Almost everyone of good will and establishment credentials surely shivered at the news.</p> <p>This includes, along with the liberal establishment and his competitors in the television business, the children of Rupert Murdoch. They, with their father, control New Corp, and for both political and internecine reasons (Ailes has undue influence over their father, they believe) have been <a href=\"http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/comment/articles/2012-01/05/michael-wolff-why-i-love-fox-news\">gunning</a> for the Fox News chairman. Also <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2010/01/09/the-fox-murdoch-feud.html\">included</a> is Wendi Murdoch, the boss's wife, whose social life is manifestly liberal with her BFFs fervently campaigning against Ailes. Even Rupert Murdoch, whose self is divided by the aggravation Ailes causes him and the money Ailes makes him, likely had a moment's pause.</p> <p>But the people who most bitterly must suck up the news of his renewal \u2013 they can't afford not to suck it up, can't afford to show the slightest lapse in their fealty to Fox News \u2013 are the mainstream Republicans with whom Ailes is most truly at war. Indeed, a life without Roger Ailes would be most dramatically different at the upper reaches of the Republican party.</p> <p>Ailes might goad and taunt the liberals, but he has <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eric-boehlert/fox-news-republican-party_b_1234219.html\">directly challenged and bested the Republicans</a>. He has set up an alternative party. </p> <p>Give credit where it is due: it's the Ailes Tea Party. Without Ailes, Fox News would merely be a conservative MSNBC, fundamentally concerned with ratings instead of rocking the boat.</p> <p>Let me make a crucial distinction here: Ailes is fundamentally concerned with ratings, but they are achieved, in his approach, precisely by rocking the boat (a concept that I doubt any other working television executive could grasp). The long-term success of Fox is the result of not just annoying the left, but of creating an ever-mounting dramatic tension among conservatives of various hues. Ailes' real theme is authenticity, and his talent is to be able to undercut everybody else's claim to it.</p> <p>Ailes creates conflict. Conflict creates good television.</p> <p>And further: Fox, with its Ailes-curated message, has changed the language of conservative politics. Talking the talk \u2013 electric, pugnacious, hyperbolic, self-dramatizing television talk \u2013 is talking Fox talk.</p> <p>Mitt Romney ought to be the guy most depressed about the Ailes' contract renewal. If Romney wins, Ailes will be his biggest political problem.</p> <p>It's a double-reversal punch line. Ailes is the key figure in promoting a Republican party bench of unelectable gargoyles. That allowed Romney, an obvious centrist, to emerge as the only viable candidate \u2013 provided, however, that he helplessly pander to the Ailes party. There may never have been a candidate who has been forced to be so at odds with himself.</p> <p>Without Ailes, Romney might pedal back to his Massachusetts self. With Ailes, and his subliminal messaging and subtle adjustments to language, Romney is hemmed in. He's stuck with Fox talk. Indeed, any deviation from that language is a deviation from conservative righteousness. Just try it.</p> <p>If Romney loses, then he's the culprit \u2013 not Fox. Romney will be the stand-in, as no doubt he should be, for all the establishment Republican phonies. Obama, remaining in office, stays as the lightening rod \u2013 indeed, the anti-Christ against which the Tea Party (or Ailes party) continues to mount its suicidal, but ratings-winning opposition.</p> <p>Ailes wins on 6 November, no matter what.</p> <p>But it is important not to see this as a political story. This is a media tale. And it is not so one-dimensional as a media mogul using his power to try to influence the political process. That's merely Murdoch 101. The reason Ailes has become almost all-powerful within News Corporation is because his worldview is vastly more complex than that. He long ago outdid Murdoch at being Murdoch.</p> <p>He's established Fox News as the pre-eminent political world. When you watch it, you're not just watching people who can influence power people, you're watching the thrilling exercise of power. What you see \u2013 the malevolence, the disruption, the veiled subtexts \u2013 is the drama of dominance and submission.</p> <p>Ailes, alone among news professionals, has understood the most important truth about modern news: nobody's interested in politics, not in real politics anyway. It's a buzz kill. Both Romney and Obama: buzz kills. Nonentities. But if you repopulate the political world with extremists, eccentrics, loudmouths and well-scripted voices, you have a show.</p> <p>That's what we have four more years of with Ailes firmly in place: parallel realities, with Fox having long since overshadowed, or even mostly replaced, actual political reality.</p> <p>It's Roger's world, and we just live in it.</p>",
  "<p>If Russia is, as Winston Churchill said, a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma, then it is time to add another layer. In the past year or so, a parallel universe has sprung up in the country, one catering to the tens of thousands of Russians who have banded together to oppose the continuing rule of Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>They have their own media. They read the weekly magazine Bolshoi Gorod, watch the hip independent TV channel Dozhd, and listen to the liberal radio station Ekho Moskvy. They go to their own cafes, peopling tables at the French-style bistro Jean-Jacques. On Friday nights they can be found at Mayak, a smoky bohemian stronghold, and on Saturday nights they go to Zavtra to hear each other DJ from their iPods.</p> <p>Now, they have their own mini-democracy. On Monday night, the opposition wrapped up three days of voting for a 45-member \"coordinating council\", a new body designed to lead the movement beyond regular protests. It will help field candidates in local elections, support political prisoners, and help spread the message about the \"crooks and thieves\" who sit in the Kremlin, to use a phrase coined by the movement's best-known leader, Alexei Navalny.</p> <p>It was a weeks-long experiment in building democracy from the ground up and trying to expand the opposition into something beyond those few Moscow cafes. As part of the elections, the opposition organised 16 straight days of debates on Dozhd, a platform for the more than 200 candidates to put forward their views.</p> <p>Part of the point of the exercise was to \"legitimise the opposition\", Navalny told me last week. The opposition has its stars, including Navalny, TV personality and Russian \"It Girl\" Ksenia Sobchak and former deputy prime minister Boris Nemtsov. And it has thousands of nameless others, some of whom appeared at the debates.</p> <p>Meet Vasily Kryukov, who describes himself as a former MP from the Urals city of Izhevsk and a \"fourth-generation repressed\", a particularly Russian turn of phrase to mark his family's long struggle with the authorities. Or Konstantin Yankauskas, an economist and municipal deputy, who turned up to his debate wearing a T-shirt showing a smiling Stalin draped by two adoring women. His nod to Stalin appeared ironic, but Anton Kongangov's was not. The young candidate described himself as \"a Stalinist, an activist and a supporter of legalising weapons\". Obama v Romney this was not.</p> <p>The candidates were taken to task on their beliefs. They did better on the general questions, posed by moderators Yury Saprykin and Demyan Kudryavtsev, both prominent journalists. \"What is Russia's greatest shame?\" they were asked. \"Television!\" said one candidate. \"Our greatest shame is that the great European people that is the Russians have allowed themselves to be ruled by Asian means, like Turkmenistan,\" said another, the far-right nationalist Nikolai Bondarik. Another, businessman Igor Ovdienko, said: \"Our great shame is that this is not a country that is attractive for living. I'm abroad often, and there's never the feeling that Russia is made for life.\"</p> <p>What Russia is made for is poetry, and the debates made sure to address that. \"Recite or name your favourite poem about freedom, politics, rights,\" Kudryavtsev asked at one point.</p> <p>Policy questions caused rather more problems. Do you believe in a presidential or parliamentary republic? Should Russia get rid of its flat income tax? And what of judicial reform?</p> <p>Maxim Kats, a candidate who became something of an opposition hero in December after being elected to a local parliament, finally blew his top: \"Judicial reform? That's not in my competence. I&#xa0;don't know. I don't have a position.\"</p> <p>It was left, in the end, to the stars to show how debates are done. \"I'm 36 and the last time I&#xa0;had a chance to vote in somewhat free elections I was 18, 19,\" Navalny said from the podium. \"I'm taking part in the free elections to the co-ordinating council now because I believe in democracy, I believe in the power of the people, that people should decide their own fate. Elections, competition, debates \u2013 even with&#xa0;unpleasant people \u2013 are what make us stronger, what will help us win.\"</p> <p>Each night, candidates, their supporters and the curious took to social networks to comment on the debates. \"Good question!\" \"What an answer \u2026\" \"I will vote for her!\" filled the feeds.</p> <p>Online, all was euphoria. The opposition's Facebook and Twitter accounts even put out a video showing interviews with Moscow factory workers who were largely oblivious to what was going on, with the majority saying they had never heard of the online vote. They added the message: \"If it seems to you that everyone has heard of the elections to the coordinating council, watch this video.\"</p> <p>In the end, just 97,500 people registered to vote (it required filing their passport details \u2013 a potential gift to the security services, some noted with worry) and around 80,000 cast their ballots. That's a bit more than the hundred who can fit around the tables at Jean-Jacques and Mayak.</p>",
  "<p>We're officially over the debate hump \u2013 three down, one to go. What a strange trip it's been. Along the way we've reconnected with our friend Big Bird, revived that old-fangled word \"malarkey!\" and, much to our surprise, been told that professional women can best be found in binders.</p> <p>In all seriousness, we have also learned quite a bit about how these vaunted debates work. Before it's too late and the final presidential match is upon us, we think it's worth taking a look back. Using what we've learned from producing our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/obama-romney-town-hall-debate-decoder\">post-debate decoders</a> \u2013 features that track the questions moderators ask and how candidates answer them \u2013 we've penned this quick list.</p> <h2>1. Debates <em>can</em> make a difference</h2> <p>Before the first match of the 2012 season, there was an outpouring of opinion on how debates \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/27/presidential-debate-myth-gamechanger\">aren't game-changers</a>\" and that they \"<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/10/03/what-political-scientists-know-about-debates/\">don't really matter</a>\". But then Romney went and unexpectedly won the first debate, and the crowds went wild \u2013 or at least the media did.</p> <p>That first match \u2013 which was watched by <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-nielsen-67-million-people-watch-first-obama-romney-debate-20121004,0,7322457.story\">67.2 million people</a> around the country \u2013 gave Romney a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/08/pew-research-poll-bombshell\">four-point bump in the polls</a>, a dramatic swing. How much of that bonus can be chalked up to his performance, and how much to the flood of media chatter is another question entirely, but the bottom line: debates can matter.</p> <h2>2. Only 17 questions have so far been asked of the next president</h2> <p>It's been an eternity since the first presidential debate of this election cycle \u2013 or at least it seems like one. Yet, only 17 questions (not including follow-ups) have been asked of the presidential candidates so far, and nearly two-thirds of them came from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/obama-romney-town-hall-debate-decoder\">Tuesday's town hall</a>. </p> <p>Jim Lehrer, for his part, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/04/obama-romney-debate-decoder\">asked only six questions</a> in the first debate, and those covered just four topics: the economy, healthcare, the role of government, and \"governing\", as he broke it down. <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/10/foreign-policy-debate-topics-138341.html\">Another six questions are expected to come out of the final debate</a>. </p> <p>The town hall format did better. Besides asking more questions overall, audience members' phrasing was more personal and more unexpected. Questions included one on gun rights, one on immigration, and one on women's rights in the workplace.</p> <p>The final question count should be 23, if we take tonight's upcoming debate into account, and that seems meager \u2013 especially since candidates don't always even answer them. </p> <h2>3. Questions on domestic policy have outplayed foreign</h2> <p>Over two presidential debates so far, 16 questions have been asked about domestic policy, and one exclusively on foreign. Another six foreign policy questions should come out of the final debate. </p> <p>Since the first and last debates are dedicated to domestic and foreign policy respectively \u2013 with the same number of questions in each \u2013 it's the second debate, the town hall, that can tip the equation towards domestic or foreign issues. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/obama-romney-town-hall-debate-decoder\">Out of the 11 questions asked during the town hall debate</a> on Tuesday night, only one \u2013 on the recent controversy over the Benghazi attacks \u2013 was squarely focused on foreign policy. The other 10 covered domestic issues, from gun rights to immigration to jobs and taxes.</p> <p>In an election that <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/10/this-one-economic-indicator-not-the-debates-might-decide-the-election/263260/\">remains tightly tied to the state of the economy</a>, it may come as little surprise that it was the most talked about issue of the two presidential debates so far. In fact, the subject was dedicated three questions in each debate \u2013 including the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/12/biden-ryan-vp-debate-decoder\">vice-presidential match-up</a>. That's the most question any one category was allotted by a wide margin. Subtopics included jobs, entitlements, taxes, and more.</p> <h2>4. Attacks take up most of the candidates' time \u2013 and ours</h2> <p>\"Attack dog\" may traditionally be the VP candidate's role, but we found that Romney and Obama weren't averse to some mudslinging of their own. In the first debate we saw the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/04/obama-romney-debate-decoder#responsegraph\">president clock in 11 jabs to Romney's 16</a>. The town hall setting of the second debate should have arguably been less attack-friendly since the candidates have to answer real audience members in real time, but that wasn't the case. </p> <p>Both Romney and Obama about doubled their attack counts this Tuesday: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/obama-romney-town-hall-debate-decoder#responsegraph\">Obama coming in with 27 hits and Romney with 25</a>. The veeps took their attacking seriously too, each putting in a whopping 30+ individual attacks during their first and only showdown. </p> <h2>5. The candidates have been light on details</h2> <p>Martha Raddatz pushed the two VP candidates for \"specifics\" many times during the vice-presidential debate \u2013 but her performance turned out to be more of an exception than a rule. In the second presidential match, Candy Crowley's follow-ups were more clear and forceful than Lehrer's in the first as she attempted to get at nuances between the candidates. But the challenges to provide detailed plans largely came from the candidates themselves in the form of attacks \u2013 though these arguments hardly made up for the lack of \"specifics\" we got from both sides.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ezraklein/posts/165161553607752\">The Washington Post's Ezra Klein posted to Facebook</a> that we shouldn't interpret Obama's vague responses to mean that he doesn't have a plan for a second term. \"It's just a hard one to campaign on,\" he wrote. \"After promising in 2008 to bring about a new era of co-operation in Washington, they're campaigning in 2012 knowing that, if re-elected, they will start their second term with a brutal, economy-shaking showdown with Republicans over spending and taxes.\"</p> <h2>6. No one is really in charge </h2> <p>Presidential debates are presented as almost platonic models of the democratic process \u2013 with clear-cut rules and processes. The debate commission sets the stage (both figuratively and literally) \u2013 making sure the candidates arrive, shake hands, exchange ideas, and the moderator gives them a slap on the wrist if they get out of line. In the end, one of the two men on stage is declared the winner. That's how it works theoretically. In reality, each and every debate is an ongoing negotiation among the moderators, debate commission, campaigns and candidates. </p> <p>Just take look at the moderators: the three so far \u2013 Lehrer and Crowley in presidential and Raddatz in the VP debate \u2013 have delivered very different performances. Lehrer was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/04/obama-romney-debate-decoder#talk\">largely criticised</a> for his light-handedness with the candidates. Raddatz's more forceful push for \"specifics\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/12/biden-ryan-vp-debate-decoder#talk\">earned her quite a bit of praise</a>. Crowley fell somewhere in between. She suffered many interruptions by an aggressive Romney and Obama, but kept on fighting to keep pace. She also made headlines with a live fact-check, though this move received mixed reviews. But no matter how any of the moderators did, all three seem to struggle with the same problem: it's hard to establish and keep control, especially since no one really has to play by the rules.</p> <p>The irony, is, of course, that the candidates sign off to <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/fullscreen/110073567?access_key=key-22or579qflh51vnl1a09\">the commission's debate rules</a>, which include taking turns to answer a question rather than interrupting, and not asking each other direct questions. </p> <p>The moderators, topics, and locations are decided by the campaigns in advance of the debates. Just take a look at the <a href=\"http://thepage.time.com/2012/10/15/the-2012-debates-memorandum-of-understanding-between-the-obama-and-romney-campaigns/\">official debate memorandum</a> obtained by Time's Mark Halperin. On page eight is where the campaigns agreed that during the 16 October debate the moderator should not ask follow-up questions.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/16/us-presidential-debates-us-elections-2012-candy-crowley-obama-romney\">As Jay Rosen put it</a> in a recent piece for the Guardian: \"No one is really in charge of the presidential debates. The situation is in charge.\"</p>",

  "<p>Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has lambasted the country's judiciary for not allowing him to visit Tehran's notorious Evin prison, where his media adviser is currently held behind bars.</p> <p>Ahmadinejad on Monday wrote an unprecedented letter to Sadeq Larijani, the head of the judicial system, protesting that his constitutional right and duty required him to inspect the prison although officials have signalled he would not be welcome.</p> <p>The letter, published on the president's government website, disclosed that Larijani had previously dispatched a \"top secret\" communique, warning that the request to visit Evin was not in the best interests of the country.</p> <p>Evin, situated in the north of the Iranian capital, is home to the country's many political prisoners as well as some of its most respected human rights activists and journalists, including the prominent lawyer Nasrin Sotodueh.</p> <p>At the time of the Islamic revolution in 1979, Iranian revolutionaries who seized Evin vowed to convert it into a museum to show the injustice under the late Shah, unaware that it was soon to be re-opened and used as a notorious prison where thousands of leftwingers were massacred in the 1980s.</p> <p>\"You have twice insisted that inspecting Evin prison is not in the best interests of the country and you have said that you disapprove of it,\" he wrote. \"But the constitution does not require any permission or approval from the judiciary for the president in administering his legal duties.\"</p> <p>Ahmadinejad's opponents in the parliament and the judiciary have speculated that the president intended to visit Evin in order to highlight the case of his close ally and top aide Ali Akbar Javanfekr, who is serving a six-month prison term there.</p> <p>Javanfekr was put on trial last year as the publisher of \"materials contrary to Islamic norms\", a reference to a series of articles about the chador, the full-length cloak worn by Iranian women.</p> <p>He was arrested in late September while Ahmadinejad was addressing the UN general assembly in New York, a sign that the president's influence over Iranian politics is dwindling.</p> <p>In his letter, Ahmadinejad insinuated that his visit was not aimed at meeting Javanfekr but to make sure the law was being justly administered by prison officials.</p> <p>\"How come that administering the constitution is not in the best interests of the country?\" he asked. \"If that kind of view prevails in the judiciary, can't we assume that some of the constitutional laws and basic human rights are being violated or neglected \u2013 or sacrificed for the best interests of individuals in the judiciary?</p> <p>\"In a situation where the president, who is the representative of the people and administrator of the law, is being so easily accused by you, how can people of this country, who have no supporter except God, make sure they have judicial security?\"</p> <p>In recent years, Evin has also been frequented by many people who are or were working for the regime, including the son and daughter of the former Iranian president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who were arrested in September. In Evin, Javanfekr and a number of the president's allies are kept not far from many opposition protesters who were arrested in the aftermath of the country's 2009 disputed presidential election which saw Ahmadinejad taking the office for a second term amid unrest and allegations of fraud.</p> <p>It is the first time Ahmadinejad has used such a strongly worded statement against the country's judiciary, which is one of Iran's main political institutions along with the parliament and the presidency.</p> <p>Some activists said it was hypocritical of Ahmadinejad not to have requested such a visit in 2009, amid allegations that prisoners faced torture. However, Ali Motahari, an influential MP and an outspoken critic of the president, said that he should be allowed to inspect Evin, urging him to meet other prisoners, too.</p> <p>On Sunday, Iran's prosecutor general, Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Ejei, embarrassed Ahmadinejad in public by saying that he could not go to Evin.</p> <p>\"We must pay attention to major issues \u2026 Visiting a prison in these circumstances is a minor issue,\" he said, according to the semi-official Mehr news agency. \"If we have in mind the best interests of the nation, a [prison] visit in these circumstances is not appropriate.\"</p> <p>The row is seen as the latest setback for Ahmadinejad and his team in an extraordinary power struggle at the top of the Iranian regime between conservatives close to the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and those supporting the president.</p> <p>In light of the setbacks, Ahmadinejad has lost a great deal of his influence, becoming increasingly marginalised, with analysts speculating that he is being used by his former allies as a scapegoat for the regime's problems.</p>",
  "<p>The banners, flags and T-shirts \u2013 Women for Obama, Hispanics for Obama, LBTG for Obama \u2013 plaster Democratic campaign offices in the hard fought swing state of Florida, just as in 2008. What's missing this time is the people.</p> <p>Four years ago Barack Obama's campaign was flooded by volunteers \u2013 the young in particular \u2013 excited by his vision of remaking America, and by the prospect of putting an African American in the White House. Now active support in Florida is visibly more sparse, and it may prove decisive as Democrats struggle to claw back the state from Mitt Romney.</p> <p>\"This election's not as inspirational as the last one was,\" said Robert Obry, deputy field organiser at a near deserted Obama campaign office in Ybor City, a historic Tampa neighbourhood popular for its bars, music and cigars. \"This one is more about straight politics. Even my grandmother, who is a Republican, voted for Obama last time which kind of blew my mind. This time she's not voting for him because she says not enough has changed.\"</p> <p>That kind of thinking crosses generations and is a problem for the president. But it's particularly significant as the Obama campaign throws its energies in Florida into getting out the vote \u2013 the \"ground game\" for which it was famed in 2008. </p> <p>A month ago, Obama was comfortably ahead in Florida by as much as five points. After the president's disastrous performance in the first debate, Romney surged ahead by seven points in one poll. Two weekend opinion polls showed Romney just one point ahead, on 49%.</p> <p>Other polls show women, Latinos and the elderly in Florida more or less evenly divided between the two presidential candidates with Romney picking up support because of concern about jobs.</p> <h2>Under-30 voters: 'They're not there now'</h2> <p>The one group that has remained consistently strong in backing the president is 18- to 29-year-olds. They accounted for 15% of the electorate in 2008 and voted two to one in favour of Obama \u2013 far ahead of any other group.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.marconews.com/news/2012/oct/21/daily-news-scripps-poll-romney-obama-dead-heat-/\">Naples Daily News/Scripps poll released on Sunday</a> showed voters under 30 continuing to support Obama by the same margin. The Democrats' challenge is to get the young to vote at all.</p> <p>Susan MacManus, a former chair of the Florida elections commission and University of South Florida professor of political science, said that turn out by people under 30 is likely to be decisive in deciding who wins the state, and the signs are not good for Obama.</p> <p>\"Part of the '08 experience for young voters was communal: we can elect a black president, we can break one of the biggest barriers in America. And we can do it by all of us piling into these campaign offices and working 18 hours a day for a pizza and a beer occasionally. They're not there now,\" she said.</p> <p>The president and first lady have campaigned at Florida university campuses to woo younger voters, impressing upon them the importance of getting to the ballot box. Florida Democrats are emphasising Obama's promise of lower interest rates on student loans, the healthcare law that allows young people to remain on their parents' insurance longer, and social issues such as gay marriage in drawing a distinction with Romney. The Democrats have poured energy into registering voters in colleges across the state and encouraging early voting which begins eight days before the election.</p> <p>Yet MacManus said that among her students she sees a stark contrast in attitude toward the election after Obama's message of hope and change four years ago gave way to emphasising fears of what will happen under a Romney presidency.</p> <p>\"From what I'm hearing from a lot of the college students, they're offended by these two guys having what looks like a street brawl. They don't even want to listen to it,\" she said. \"Can the Democrats find a way to break through all of the negatives in the ads, all the negatives in the debates, break through to the two groups of voters that are leaning in their direction but are getting very alienated by the negativity \u2013 and that's young voters, especially college students, and women voters? I don't know.\"</p> <p>Getting the young to vote is even more important in the numbers game because many conservatives who stayed away from the polls in 2008 because they were unhappy with John McCain as the Republican candidate are now fired up by a determination to get rid of Obama.</p> <p>Matty Budesa, president of the FSU college Democrats group, said she does not see a drop off in enthusiasm among young voters but she does recognise that the campaign is very different from 2008.</p> <p>\"A lot of people were fired up for that election. It's not necessarily not as passionate this time, but maybe people don't want to care about it as much because it's sort of a scary thought,\" she said. \"Young people really see what's at stake this time just because there are a lot of differences between the candidates as far as their views on issues young people care about: gay marriage, family planning, obviously different federal funding issues, the cost of education.\"</p> <p>Budesa said part of the Democratic strategy this time is not to emphasise that their vote can change the world so much as preserve what Obama has achieved.</p> <p>\"There's a lot of people telling them this election very much depends on you and this isn't the time to not be excited. This is the time to really step up,\" she said.</p> <h2>'I can't say I'm very excited about Obama anymore'</h2> <p>Around the corner from the Ybor City campaign office, younger voters were not enthused.</p> <p>\"If I vote, I'll vote Obama,\" said Michael Foster, a 25-year-old recent graduate with no job. \"But probably I won't vote. I can't say I'm very excited about Obama anymore.\"</p> <p>Why not?</p> <p>\"I don't hear him talking about our future. It's all for old people. Medicare, that kind of stuff. I really don't know who's going to be better for me to find a job. I thought it was Obama but I don't know,\" he said. \"We all believed Obama would change this country. He's done some good stuff but the country hasn't really changed. It's the same shit.\"</p> <p>Aaron D'Souza, an Obama campaign volunteer at the Ybor City office from London, said the ambivalence toward the election may also reflect complacency.</p> <p>\"The lack of energy might be because people thought Obama had it in the bag, especially after Romney's 47% comment,\" he said. \"Now they know it's not.\"</p> <p>The Democrats boast that with 102 campaign offices in Florida they have more than twice as many as the Republicans. Obry said the volunteers are still coming to the Ybor City office. But their numbers across the Tampa area are evidently down. </p> <p>The Republicans have noticed it, too.</p> <p>\"The evidence of Obama is so sparse this time compared to four years ago,\" said Art Wood, chair of the Hillsborough county Republican party, which includes Tampa. \"We started street corner sign waving a couple of months ago. Four years ago we often had Obama supporters on the other corner. I've yet to see a single Obama sign waver. We're up to three or four times a week in different parts of the city and not a single Obama sign waver.\"</p> <p>One of Obama's campaign press secretaries, Jen Psaki, last week denied rumours flying around the Republican team that the Democrats are diverting money and resources from Florida and two other battleground states, North Carolina and Virginia, in order to focus the president's bid for re-election on winning Ohio and three other close states where he is still ahead in opinion polls \u2013 Iowa, Nevada and New Hampshire \u2013 which would be enough to put him back in the White House.</p> <p>Psaka said the Obama campaign was \"absolutely not\" pulling back.</p> <p>\"We're still going to run in every state like we're five points behind,\" she said.</p> <h2>Signs of hope in early voting</h2> <p>Democrats in Florida have some reasons for optimism. Their campaign to get supporters to vote early shows signs of paying off.</p> <p>Republicans have traditionally led the way in Florida in supporters voting by mail but the numbers this year show that the Democrats have eaten into that advantage.</p> <p>About 2.2 million people in Florida have requested absentee ballots \u2013 a 37% leap on 2008. About 42% of the requests came from registered Republicans while 39% were from Democrats. Four years ago, the gap was 14 points in favour of Republicans.</p> <p>Of 275,000 absentee ballots already returned to election offices by mid-October, 44% came from registered Republicans while 40% were from Democrats.</p> <p>In 2008, Republicans were 17 points ahead at a similar stage.</p> <p>The Obama campaign director in Florida, Ashley Walker, latched on to those gains in an email to twitchy activists last week.</p> <p>\"In 2008, Republicans built up a huge advantage in vote-by-mail which Democrats obliterated during in-person early vote to win the state by 3 percentage points. In 2012, Republicans have a much more difficult task ahead since they have already ceded two-thirds of the vote-by-mail advantage they started with four years ago,\" she said in the message.</p> <p>Republicans acknowledge that could be a problem for them, although they say they are concerned not alarmed.</p> <p>Republicans also point to a fall in the number of registered Democrats in Florida which has dropped by more than 94,000 to about 4.6 million. But that still puts the party ahead of the Republicans on 4.2 million.</p> <p>The Democrats' problem is that the previous experience shows that older people are much more likely to vote, and the older they are the more likely they are to vote Republican.</p> <p>Alongside trying to get the young out to vote, the Obama campaign is trying to woo \u2013 some might say scare \u2013 older swing voters. The vice-president, Joe Biden, descended on the Sun City Center retirement community of about 19,000 people south of Tampa on Friday. John McCain took 60% of the vote there in 2008.</p> <p>The local hall was packed, with lines of golf carts residents use to get around the streets on specially marked lanes parked outside.</p> <p>Biden, too, emphasised early voting. But the core message was that a Romney presidency will be a financial disaster for the elderly, not least over healthcare.</p> <p>\"This is not your father's Republican party. This is not even Mitt Romney's father's Republican party,\" said Biden.</p> <p>Ellen Harris, who retired to Florida from Pennsylvania, liked the message. But she acknowledge that it may not be having much effect on Florida's elderly voters.</p> <p>\"It seems really weird to us here that more people wouldn't lean left on Medicare after all that crazy Republican primary stuff. Too many people watch Fox News,\" she said</p> <p>Harris said the Republicans appear to be running a more efficient campaign on the ground among the elderly.</p> <p>\"We get four or five flyers a day from the Republicans or their supporters like the NRA. We hardly get anything from the Democrats,\" she said. \"There's a lot of robocalls, too, mostly Republican.\"</p>",
  "<p>Some senior cabinet members want to limit the number of TV debates in the next election campaign to just one, but they are likely to face a counter-offer from Channel 4 that there should be four debates: two during the campaign itself and two in the months before the election, due to be called in June 2015.</p> <p>Discussions between the parties and the broadcasters are likely to start soon with initial feelers being put out by the broadcasters.</p> <p>There is cross party concern, but by no means a consensus that the three debates held during the concentrated three weeks of the campaign made the whole campaign focus excessively on the leaders' performance in the TV debates, in the run up to the debates and then lengthy post debate analysis.</p> <p>Some cabinet members feel this focus on the leaders' debating techniques squeezed any focused analysis of the broader party policy prospectus on other issues.</p> <p>In a sign of the importance attached to the TV debates, Craig Oliver, the No 10 director of communications, is in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/20/obama-romney-campaign-final-debate?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">the US watching the presidential debates </a>and will be looking at the methods deployed by both camps.</p> <p>Labour is confident that leader Ed Miliband will perform well in the debates, but acknowledge that the format led to an excessive concentration on the debates at the expense of much else.</p> <p>Figures at Channel 4, squeezed out of the debates last time by Sky, BBC and ITN, are seeing if there is any support for a fourth debate with two held in the long up to the election, and two during the campaign.</p> <p>The 2010 campaign was the first election in which the three parties came to a collective view that the debates would be in their leaders' interest. In previous elections, talks on a TV debate broke down, normally due to disagreements about the role of the Liberal Democrats or a fear among key figures in the party expected to win that they had nothing to gain from the TV debates.</p> <p>There is an general expectation at Westminster that it would be impossible for any party to go back on the principle of holding TV debates, but the fact that leading figures in the main two parties already hold very different positions on how to repeat the 2010 experience suggest tough negotiations may be ahead.</p> <p>But one cabinet member said: \"We ended up with three debates largely because there were [three] TV channels demanding them \u2013 ITV, Sky and the BBC \u2013 but there is no need for them to dominate in the way they did.\"</p> <p>The danger of having only one debate is that it can put too much pressure on a single event with one poor performance, such as the recent limp performance by Barack Obama in the first US presidential TV debate, holding disproportionate influence.</p> <p>It has been suggested that the polls moved by as much as four to six points on the back of Mitt Romney trouncing Obama in the first debate.</p> <p>It has been argued that the debates would not dominate coverage of the election campaigns since the novelty of 2010 would have worn off. The first TV debate of that year scored an audience of 9.4 million and was generally seen as a great victory for the Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, but the subsequent \"Clegg-mania\" did not translate into votes.</p> <p>Labour is also assessing what demands to make on air time and format, in view of the fact that Miliband will be going into the election attacking the record in government of the two parties he is debating.</p> <p>Conservatives and Liberal Democrats will want to stress their independence by setting out how they would take different approaches to issues in the future.</p> <p>Oliver Dowden, David Cameron's political adviser, in an interview released at the weekend, said the Conservatives were looking at the way in which US parties used social media followings on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.</p> <p>He said the US was in the vanguard of election techniques and the UK parties will be learning from what the Democrats and Republicans have been doing. Dowden pointed out that the US election was likely to have cost $5bn (\u00a33.1bn), compared with the \u00a320m spending cap in the UK.</p>",
  "<p>At the Guthrie theatre in Minneapolis, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDaQr9Vp4XM\" title=\"\">Christopher Hampton is currently being celebrated</a> \u2013 and rightly so, since his output includes original plays (Total Eclipse, The Philanthropist, White Chameleon), creative adaptations (<a href=\"http://www.nytheatre-wire.com/mc08052t.htm\" title=\"\">Les&nbsp;Liaisons Dangereuses</a>) and award-winning screenplays (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfjbjeJoILs\" title=\"\">Atonement</a>). But the centrepiece is a new work, Appomattox: a big, bold play about race in America that marks a major new departure for Hampton who, in the past, has shown himself to be a wry observer of modern manners and something of a contemporary classicist.</p> <p>The fact that this festival devoted to a British dramatist is taking place in the American midwest is the result of two visionary Irishmen. The first was the pioneering director, Tyrone Guthrie, <a href=\"http://www.guthrietheater.org/about_guthrie/theater_history\" title=\"\">who 50 years ago established a dynamic theatre in Minneapolis</a>. In 1995 Joe Dowling, who had run the Dublin Abbey, became the theatre's sixth director, and in 2006 launched a <a href=\"http://www.arcspace.com/architects/nouvel/guthrie/guthrie.html\" title=\"\">new, state-of-the-art building designed by Jean Nouvel</a>. It boasts three auditoriums seating a total of 2,000, echoes the industrial landscape of Minneapolis and has a cantilevered lobby that juts out in space towards the Mississippi. Mark Rylance, who has co-written a play called Nice Fish opening at the Guthrie in April, based on the work of Louis Jenkins, <a href=\"http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/16/mark-rylance-play-written-with-a-favorite-poet-is-coming-to-the-guthrie/\" title=\"\">the Duluth poet he has quoted numerous times at the Tony awards</a>, ruffled a few feathers back in the UK when he said the Guthrie made our own National theatre look like a tin shack. That may be overpitching it, but the Guthrie strikes me as an architectural triumph.</p> <p>Having mounted a Tony Kushner season in 2009, Dowling has turned the spotlight on Hampton. There are panels, talks (one of which I gave), showings of films Hampton scripted or directed, and revivals of Tales from Hollywood and Embers. But there is no doubt that Appomattox is the big event. I said in my talk that Hampton was the quiet man of British theatre. Now he has confounded expectations with a large-cast play on a public theme: the halting progress towards racial equality in American society. It takes chutzpah for a British dramatist to tackle such a subject, but Hampton has pulled it off, and in the process revealed, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/06/books/review/the-passage-of-power-robert-caros-new-lbj-book.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" title=\"\">in the footsteps of Robert Caro's acclaimed biography</a>, that Lyndon Baines Johnson was not only a huge character, but a hugely misunderstood one.</p> <p>Hampton's play takes its title from the <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/apco/index.htm\" title=\"\">place in Virginia where in 1865 the Confederate army surrendered to Union forces in the American civil war</a>. The first half, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15011594\" title=\"\">which began life as an opera libretto for Philip Glass in 2007</a> but is here reimagined, charts the final stages of the conflict. But Hampton's play really catches fire in the second half, set largely in the White House during the LBJ presidency exactly 100 years later.</p> <p>It was a time of civil rights protests and of the passage, encouraged by Martin Luther King, of <a href=\"http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&amp;doc=100\" title=\"\">a new Voting Rights act</a>, supposedly leading to universal suffrage. LBJ emerges as a tragicomic figure of immense theatrical power. He reminds me of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/oct/10/cat-on-a-hot-tin-roof-review\" title=\"\">Tennessee Williams's Big Daddy</a> in his mix of sensitivity and crudity. He says of JFK: \"Lotta times when he met a woman he couldn't remember if he'd fucked her or made her husband an ambassador.\" But Hampton never lets us forget that although the president was a masterly tactician and socially progressive, he was haunted by Vietnam. \"I tell you,\" he says, \"that Vietnam's going to be the death of me.\" And, he might have added, of numberless thousands of Americans and Vietnamese.</p> <p>In David Esbjornson's production, LBJ's contradictions are beautifully caught by Harry Groener, best known to British audiences for playing Mayor Wilkins in Buffy the Vampire Slayer (the fact that he doubles as Lincoln adds to the ironies). On a technical level, the play <a href=\"http://www.tcdailyplanet.net/arts/theater/appomattox-christopher-hampton-guthrie-theater-review\" title=\"\">could be improved</a>: a coda, set in an Alabama state prison in 2010, feels awkward. And, during my visit, I saw two earlier Hampton pieces excellently revived: Tales from Hollywood in a delightful, filmic production from Ethan McSweeny and Embers elegantly staged by Joe Dowling.</p> <p>But Appomattox shows Hampton staking out new territory, and proving that he's no less adept than David Hare in exploring major public events. With a momentous election currently being fought, it was disconcerting to learn of a continuing racial bias in the electoral system, with some states advocating ever-more rigorous voter ID in order to limit the franchise. As Hampton's epic reminds us, the idealistic hopes expressed at the end of the American civil war have still be realised \u2013 and race remains a potent and living issue.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 30 October 2012. The original said the play took its name from the courthouse where the Confederate army surrendered. The surrender document was not signed in a courthouse but in a house in the town of Appomattox Court House.</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 As the election campaign grinds towards an excruciatingly close result, one person not biting his nails is Donald Trump \u2013 because, he explains, he's in possession of a \"bombshell\" secret that could swing the race. On Fox News's morning chat show, the golf-course-imposing conspiracy theorist promised to reveal \"something very, very big concerning the president of the United States\", though not until Wednesday, presumably because his team of fact-checking unicorns are still busy verifying it. Aficionados of Trump surprises (not to be confused with surprise trumps, though it's an easy mistake to make) may recall his promise of a similar \"big surprise\" for the Republican National Convention in August. Speculation ran rampant: would it be a) a tedious video in which the Apprentice host pretended to fire Barack Obama? Or b) actually there was no option b), because it was so obviously going to be a tedious video in which Trump pretended to fire Barack Obama. In the event, Hurricane Isaac prompted the cancellation of that day's convention events \u2013 though, yes, a tedious Apprentice-style video was exactly what he'd intended. \"I know one thing,\" Trump told his Fox questioners about Wednesday's incendiary revelation. \"You will cover it in a very big fashion.\" Which, in his defence, they probably will. This diary, on the other hand, will not belittle itself by indulging his blatantly attention-seeking \u2026 oh, damn it.</p> <p>\u2022 Speaking of conspiracy theorists: we'll be hearing from them in the coming days, almost certainly, after a CBS station in Arizona accidentally called the election for Obama. For 17 seconds, the conservative Daily Caller website reports, the people of Phoenix were treated to a graphic showing that the president had triumphed over Mitt Romney, 43% to 40%, with 99% of precincts reporting. (No explanation was given for who received the remaining 17%.) An unfortunate error during rehearsals for election night? Or, as some Daily Caller commenters seem to think, evidence of an elaborately pre-arranged Democratic victory, much like the moon landings were secretly filmed in the desert, with Neil Armstrong wearing special bouncy shoes? Tellingly, as of Sunday, the station's manager wasn't returning requests for comment. Why the tight-lipped silence?</p> <p>\u2022 With election day looming, endorsements are tumbling in. The Salt Lake Tribune has endorsed Obama, despite the fact that it serves the city where Romney rescued the Winter Olympics, a feat that many theologians agree was literally a miracle. Less surprisingly, the New Yorker has also called for the president's re-election \u2013 or what the magazine actually describes, following its idiosyncratic house style, as his \"re\u00eblection\". The big question now is whether he can re\u00ebnergise his base. And, additionally \u2013 because Democratic candidates suffer when it rains on voting day \u2013 whether the weather will co\u00f6perate.</p> <p>\u2022 Department of Unfortunate Symbolism: An airship featuring the slogan \"America Needs Romney\", along with a huge photograph of the candidate, sailed across Florida's Broward County on Sunday. But it diverged from its original course, blown around by changing winds, then fell abruptly to earth, making an emergency landing. \"Hours later, the 160-foot airship was deflated, flat and sprawled along the grass,\" the Miami Herald reports. Note to Florida's political cartoonists: polls have Romney leading in Florida, so, no, you'll have to think of a different idea, I'm afraid.</p>",
  "<p>The Green party's presidential candidate has called Barack Obama a \"climate denier\" for failing to talk about climate change during the elections.</p> <p>On the eve of the third and final presidential debate, the Green party's <a href=\"http://www.jillstein.org/\" title=\"\">Jill Stein</a> said Obama's failure to speak out about environmental concerns made him virtually identical to Republicans who deny the human causes of global warming.</p> <p>The absence of climate change from the elections, after a year of record temperatures, wildfires and drought, has hugely frustrated environmental campaigners.</p> <p>Obama and Mitt Romney, who has expressed doubt about the human causes of climate change and the viability of renewable energy such as wind power, have failed to address the issue in their last two presidential debates.</p> <p>But no campaigner has gone as far as Stein, who said Obama was \"another climate denier who basically sold out with just a little bit of window dressing\".</p> <p>When challenged about the use of the word \"denier\", Stein said: \"We sure didn't hear him talking about climate in his debate. In either of these debates we don't hear him talking about climate and the devastation of it. Whether he is a denier or just a silencer, he has certainly silenced any discussion of the issue that would motivate real solutions.\"</p> <p>Stein, a Harvard-trained doctor, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/16/hofstra-debate-jill-stein-arrested-green-party_n_1971960.html?utm_hp_ref=elections-2012\" title=\"\">was arrested trying to gain entry to last week's presidential debate</a>. Her arrest has focused attention on the exclusion of third-party candidates from such events.</p> <p>The Green party is on the ballot in 38 states, but is still polling at only about 2%. It is still viewed negatively by many on the left for its role in costing Al Gore the 2000 election.</p> <p>When the third and last presidential debate takes place on Monday night, Stein will be in San Francisco taking part in a virtual debate with other third-party candidates in a forum hosted by Amy Goodman's <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/\" title=\"\">Democracy Now</a>.</p> <p>Obama and Romney have yet to face a direct question on climate change in the debates, and they have given scant attention to environmental concerns, even during their long and heated exchange on oil drilling and gas prices during last week's debate.</p> <p>Obama, far from touting his biggest green achievement of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jul/29/barack-obama-fuel-economy-standards\" title=\"\">raising car mileage standards</a>, used the debate to talk up his support for oil and coal.</p> <p>\"It is outrageous they will not even mention this devastating reality we are facing,\" said Stein, ticking off the growing evidence of climate change in the widespread US drought and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/14/arctic-sea-ice-smallest-extent\" title=\"\">unprecedented melting in the Arctic</a>. \"The climate catastrophe that used to be generations away is rapidly closing in on us.\"</p> <p>The larger environmental groups have hesitated to criticise Obama very openly for fear of costing him votes during an increasingly close election. Environmental groups are mainly supporting Obama and Democratic candidates for Congress in these elections.</p> <p>In Stein's view that too is a mistake. Obama has failed to live up to his 2008 campaign promise to save a \"planet in peril\", she said. \"I wasn't fooled by Obama then. I was not persuaded and a lot of other people were. The talk is very different from the walk,\" she said. \"These last four years have been drill baby drill and far worse. Obama's adopted the fossil fuel policies of George Bush and done far worse,\" she said.</p> <p>A second Obama term, Stein said, would amount to \"climate devastation with a friendly face and a warm endearing personality\".</p> <p>She went on to argue that a Romney victory in November would not be that great a loss for the environment - despite the Republican's promises to do away with environmental protections and Obama's moves to curb coal plant emissions.</p> <p>Stein, who is from Massachusetts, has direct experience of a Romney administration from his time as governor there. \"Flip-flopping is his downfall, but it is also his political instinct to go with the squeaky wheel,\" she said. That suggested Romney would be little different, as president, than Obama.</p> <p>\"I think it's really important to hold Obama equally accountable, and it is an absolutely false choice to tell people they have to choose one or the other,\" Stein said. \"Obama is not going to get us out of here alive. His climate policies are just as devastating.\"</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama is almost certain to tout the ending of the war in Iraq and the timetable for the withdrawal from Afghanistan in tonight's third and final presidential debate.</p> <p>He goes into the contest with Mitt Romney at Lynn university in Boca Raton in an unusual position for a Democrat, with polls showing him regarded as strong on foreign policy and security, traditionally Republican areas of strength.</p> <p>But that lead has been diminishing. A Pew poll this month found 47% trusted Obama on foreign and security issues against 43% for Romney. The changing story over the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, in which the US ambassador to Libya and three other Americans were killed, is also an area of potential weakness for Obama.</p> <p>The audiences for the first two debates \u2013 67 million and 65 million \u2013 are higher than those in 2008 and, though foreign policy is not usually of as much interest as domestic policy, there is likely to be big viewing figures again, not least because it is being billed as a tie-breaker. Romney clearly won the first and Obama edged the second.</p> <h2>The format</h2> <p>The debate, moderated by CBS veteran Bob Schieffer, is to be cut into six 15-minute segments covering: America's role in the world; Afghanistan and Pakistan; Israel and Iran; the Middle East and terrorism (two segments being devoted to this); and the rise of China and the future.</p> <p>The two will sit at a desk with Schieffer rather than stand at a podium or wander around as in last week's town hall-style debate.</p> <h2>Debate preparation</h2> <p>Obama has been studying and rehearsing at the presidential retreat Camp David, Maryland, while Romney has opted to station himself close to the debate, rehearsing at a hotel in Boca Raton.</p> <p>Obama has been practising, as for the first two debates, with senator John Kerry standing in for Romney. It is a lot of work for the stand-ins, having to read through reams of Romney speeches and interviews as well as video footage.</p> <p>Romney too has stuck with same debate partner, senator Rob Portman.</p> <h2>The issues</h2> <p>Obama starts from a strong position as the president who ended one war and is in the process of ending a second \u2013 and, on top of that, Osama bin Laden was killed on his watch.<br> The Obama team put out an ad on Monday morning about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, an indication that this is what he will play up tonight.</p> <p>Romney has to try to undermine this by accusing the Obama administration of issuing contradictory statements over Libya.</p> <p>Obama has several lines of defence. He is helped by a CIA assessment that is the same as the Obama administration offered at the time: that the attack began as a result of protests over an anti-Muslim video and extremists took over. </p> <p>The president could politicise Libya more directly, as the Obama-supporting group American Bridge did today in a video, by accusing Republicans of refusing state department appeals not to cut the security budget.</p> <p>Iran is bound to come up, especially after the New York Times report that the US and Iran have agreed to one-on-one talks after the election, which the White House denies.</p> <p>Romney is almost certain to raise again his claim that Obama has failed to support the Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu as much he would as president.</p> <h2>The strategies</h2> <p>Both would like to appeal to the demographic groups they have been targeting in recent weeks, mainly women and Latinos, but it is hard to do that on foreign policy.</p> <p>But there is one demographic that Romney could reach by focusing on proposed defence cuts. Virginia is one of the swing states, with lots of people employed by the defence industry and worried that spending cuts could mean the loss of their jobs.</p> <p>With no more debates after this one, neither can afford to make a major gaffe.<br>In the end, it could be that the details of foreign policy matter less than likeability, a big factor in any election. The candidates have to try to find a balance between not being seen as being bullied by the other but at the same time not alienating viewers by interrupting or, worse still, a loss of temper.</p>",

The European Commission wants the size of the EU budget to be increased, a proposal which is anathema to the British government at a time of fiscal austerity at home. The UK is not the only country opposed to a large increase in the EU budget. But few are likely to fight as hard or as long against an increase as the UK.</p> <p>For his part, the British prime minister, David Cameron, is under enormous pressure from his own largely Eurosceptic Conservative Party to veto any budget deal that is inimical to British interests. Further struggles over banking union and efforts to repatriate key powers will follow, as pressures build on both sides of the Channel. Financial market pressures are forcing euro zone countries to contemplate deeper integration, while domestic political pressures are pushing the UK in the opposite direction.</p> <p>The UK will therefore find itself fighting some lonely battles over the coming months.</p> </blockquote> <p>Our Europe editor Ian Traynor warned <strong>a week ago </strong>that last week's EU summit would push Britain closer to the exits in this article: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/14/europe-franco-german-tussle-brussels\">Europe prepares for another Franco-German tussle in Brussels</a>.</p> <p><em>EU policymakers may not want to push the UK out, but they won't jump through hoops to keep the country in, either.</em></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T10:27:24.228Z\">at 11.27am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50851c8b58f96784ee2908ab\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T10:14:35.518Z\">11.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">GERMANY DENIES SUMMIT ROW WITH BRITAIN</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The German government has denied that it is threatening to cancel December's EU summit unless Britain caves in over the European Union's budget (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/22/eurozone-crisis-ireland-merkel-cameron-veto#block-5084f501c0e343ef1abc7dfc\">see 8.25am</a>)</p> <p><strong>Steffen Seibert</strong>,&#xa0;Angela Merkel's official spokesman, just told reporters in Berlin that the report (the front page splash of today's <strong>Financial Times</strong>) was wrong.</p> <p>Seibert said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is not true.

In 10 Downing St., his advisers are not only discussing whether to hold a referendum but also how to win one, says a senior minister involved in the plans. But the weakness of his political position means he cannot rule out leading a campaign to take the U.K. out of the EU if his renegotiation demands are not met.</p> <p>That puts him in a perilous situation. His hopes for a successful renegotiation rest largely on the belief that the euro zone's only hope of survival lies in full political union and the mutualization of debts. But this may be a miscalculation: Much of the fiscal and banking union needed to resolve the crisis are already in place and much of what remains to be done can probably be done within existing treaties, as it was with the fiscal pact. Even if Mr. Cameron had a radical agenda, the rest of the EU may see no need to indulge him\u2014particularly if, as last December, no U.K. interests are at stake.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cameron's misfortune/strategic blunder is to be trapped between two formidable obstacles. On one flank (<em>the right, presumably</em>) the Conservative Party's eurosceptics. On the other, a European establishment which is more concerned with saving the single currency than helping the Brits backpedal.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T08:59:20.263Z\">at 9.59am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5085051dc0e343ef1abc7e01\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T08:34:37.092Z\">9.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Talk of snap elections in Greece</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Political developments in Greece this morning, where an MP has been slung out out the ruling coalition.</p> <p><strong>Nikos Stavrogiannis</strong> was expelled from New Democracy's parliamentary group after he declared on Sunday that he might not support the country's new austerity programme when it comes before parliament.</p> <p>Stavrogiannis said the measure being imposed by the Troika are \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201cineffective\u201d.

Hassan played a \u201chigh-stakes\u201d game both in investigating Hezbollah\u2019s role in the 2005 murder of former prime minister Rafiq Hariri, and the arrest that he organised in August of Michel Samaha, a minister linked to the Syrian government, over terrorism allegations.</p> <p><a href=\"http://audioboo.fm/boos/1019746-wissam-al-hassan-s-killing-could-spark-lebanon-s-combustible-mix-despite-calls-for-calm-from-future-movement-says-qifanabki\">Speaking on a noisy Skype line</a> he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Lebanon is very combustible. This current situation is especially dangerous because of the fractiousness of the Sunni community and the lack of control that [former prime minister] Saad Hariri and his Future Movement can exert over certain elements of the population, who are very angry and want to see more a proactive stance in support of the Syrian revolution, and are fed up with assassination after assassination and by what they see as Hezbollah\u2019s military dominance. This could easily become the straw that broke the camel's back. It could lead to the kind of civil violence that everybody has been trying to prevent.</p> </blockquote> <p>But for now the opposition Future Movement is making all the right noises, Muhanna said. He was encouraged by Hariri\u2019s attempt to rein in the radical demands of some Sunni groups. \u201cHariri doesn\u2019t want to assume power at this point - given all that\u2019s happening in Syria,\" he said. But there needs to be political consensus for cooler heads to prevail, he argued.</p> <p>\u201cIf they can find a way of containing the situation and keeping [prime minister Najib] Mikati in power then they may be able to return in some ways to the status quo,\" Muhanna said.</p> <p>There is as yet no evidence pointing to a link to Syria, Muhanna pointed out. But he said there is a long history of assassination of Lebanese figures who act against Syria\u2019s interests in Lebanon.</p> <p>It is impossible to tell whether Hezbollah was involved Hassan\u2019s killing, Muhanna noted. But he added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think it is fair to say that Hezbollah does not gain by a situation in which Lebanon is pulled into sectarian violence. Hezbollah has really tried to insulate Lebanon from the Syrian crisis.</p> </blockquote> <p>Leaked documents have suggested that Hassan had regular contact with one of Hezbollah\u2019s security chiefs. \u201cHe was really somebody who lived inbetween the spaces between Damascus and Beirut,\u201d Muhanna said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ab-player&quot; data-boourl=&quot;http://audioboo.fm/boos/1019746-wissam-al-hassan-s-killing-could-spark-lebanon-s-combustible-mix-despite-calls-for-calm-from-future-movement-says-qifanabki/embed&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://audioboo.fm/boos/1019746-wissam-al-hassan-s-killing-could-spark-lebanon-s-combustible-mix-despite-calls-for-calm-from-future-movement-says-qifanabki&quot;&gt;listen to &amp;#x2018;Wissam al-Hassan&amp;#x27;s killing could spark Lebanon&amp;#x27;s combustible mix despite calls for calm from Future Movement says @QifaNabki&amp;#x2019; on Audioboo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;(function() { var po = document.createElement(&quot;script&quot;); po.type = &quot;text/javascript&quot;; po.async = true; po.src = &quot;http://d15mj6e6qmt1na.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js&quot;; var s = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;)[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(po, s); })();&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T15:14:00.352Z\">at 4.14pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5085484cc0e343ef1abc7e24\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T13:21:17.089Z\">2.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Turkish-Syrian tensions</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Turkey has rejected Israeli calls for talks on the Syria crisis, as analysts express concern about Ankara's increasing aggression towards Syria.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?newsId=296024\">According to the Turkish daily Zaman</a> the calls for talks came from Pinhas Avivi, a former Israeli ambassador to Turkey and current political director of the Israeli foreign ministry.</p> <p>He suggested Syria and Turkey should both acknowledge mistakes over border violence, to avoid the tension escalating further.</p> <p>Most analysts believe Turkey wants to avoid war with Syria despite Ankara's belligerent rhetoric.</p> <p>But a new paper for the International Institute for Strategic Studies predicted that increased <a href=\"http://www.iiss.org/publications/strategic-comments/past-issues/volume-18-2012/october/turkeys-frustrations-grow-with-syrian-civil-war\">military tension and even some form of intervention is still a possibility</a>.</p> <p>It said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Recent events suggest that Turkey's policy towards Syria has entered a new and more aggressive phase. Ankara appears determined to increase the pressure on the Assad regime, raising the possibility of increased Turkish aid to the FSA and even artillery support, from inside Turkey, for Free Syrian Army operations in Syria.</p> <p>The likelihood of a war between Turkey and Syria remains remote.

It would be a mistake to underestimate the AKP's frustration at Assad's continued hold on power, Nato allies' refusal to play a more active role in trying to overthrow him and the emergence of a Kurdish enclave inside Syria. Although it currently appears small, there is nevertheless a danger that sustained \u2013 or even increased \u2013 military tensions could generate a momentum that could drag Turkey deeper into a highly complex conflict from which it would be hard to extricate itself.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T13:42:59.320Z\">at 2.42pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50853a37c0e343ef1abc7e1f\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T12:21:11.766Z\">1.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Lebanese army warning</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Lebanon's army has called for calm amid reports that the latest wave of violence has eased.</p> <p>Reuters reports: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Lebanon's army said on Monday the nation faced a critical phase after the assassination of a senior intelligence officer prompted violent protests across the country.</p> <p>\"We call on all political leaders to be cautious when expressing their stances and opinions,\" said a statement by the army, adding that it would take \"decisive measures\" to prevent chaos in areas of high tension.</p> </blockquote> <p>Journalists in Beirut said overnight violence, which killed at least two people, appears to be over for now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mitchprothero/status/260347904961687552\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Streets in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23Beirut\">#Beirut</a> reach uneasy calm but unclear if Army in control or if this is a just a break before nightfall. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23Lebanon\">#Lebanon</a></p>&mdash; mitchell prothero (@mitchprothero) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mitchprothero/status/260347904961687552\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-22T11:52:32+00:00\">October 22, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/javierespinosa2/status/260342863076921344\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Clashes over in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23beirut\">#beirut</a>,lots of army vehicles around Tarik al Jedid <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23Lebanon\">#Lebanon</a></p>&mdash; JAVIER ESPINOSA (@javierespinosa2) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/javierespinosa2/status/260342863076921344\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-22T11:32:30+00:00\">October 22, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/middle-east-north-africa/lebanon\">Britain's foreign office has updated its travel advice to Lebanon</a> in the wake of Friday's bomb attack and ensuing violence.

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As it stands right now, this aggressive posture doesn\u2019t appear to be stamping out some of the more militant activity. In many cases roads will be closed and then reopen later. It is just not clear right now whether there is enough security forces in Beirut to get a handle on things.</p> </blockquote> <p>There has been a heavy security presence in the areas of Qasqas, Tariq al-Jdideh, Cola Bridge, which Prothero described as \u201csectarian fault lines\u201d.</p> <p>The casualty count will be critical in the next couple of days, he said. If there is significant bloodshed there is a danger that the cycle of sectarian violence could spin out of control, he predicted. </p> <p><a href=\"http://audioboo.fm/boos/1019253-mitchprothero-says-beirut-security-forces-struggling-to-contain-syria-related-sectarian-violence-after-friday-s-bomb-attack\">Speaking to the Guardian from Beirut</a>, Prothero said: \"I fear the security forces have until this evening to get this over with, with the minimum of casualties or we could see an ongoing situation.\"</p> <p>He said the scale of the violence and uncertainty feels different from previously Syria-related sectarian tension in Lebanon.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are used to a certain amount of sectarian tension that mimics the situation in Syria, popping off in the northern city of Tripoli where there has been a great deal of tension between pro-Syrian and anti-Syrian Sunni Muslim factions ... But what we are seeing since the killing of General Wissam al-Hassan is that this has really spread to Beirut.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Syrian government is widely believed to be behind the attack, he said. It is difficult to imagine any other suspects for the killing, given Hassan's record of investigating Syria\u2019s influence in violence in Lebanon, Prothero said.</p> <p>Sunni anger at the bombing appears to be spontaneous and leaderless, he pointed out. \"While it doesn\u2019t appear to be organised on the Sunni side it appears to be spreading all across the city, making it very difficult for the security forces,\" he said. </p> <p>The Sunni opposition lack strong leadership, he said. Exiled former prime minister Saad Hariri did not return to the country for yesterday\u2019s funeral, Prothero noted. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At this point he\u2019s a voice on a television screen, or a Skype or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HaririSaad\">Twitter accoun</a>t. Thus not really connecting with the Sunni streets.</p> </blockquote> <p>For its part, the militant Shia group Hezbollah has stayed quiet since Friday\u2019s attack, focusing instead on protecting their Shia neighbourhoods, Prothero reported. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ab-player&quot; data-boourl=&quot;http://audioboo.fm/boos/1019253-mitchprothero-says-beirut-security-forces-struggling-to-contain-syria-related-sectarian-violence-after-friday-s-bomb-attack/embed&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://audioboo.fm/boos/1019253-mitchprothero-says-beirut-security-forces-struggling-to-contain-syria-related-sectarian-violence-after-friday-s-bomb-attack&quot;&gt;listen to &amp;#x2018;@mitchprothero says Beirut security forces struggling to contain Syria-related sectarian violence after Friday&amp;#x27;s bomb attack &amp;#x2019; on Audioboo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;(function() { var po = document.createElement(&quot;script&quot;); po.type = &quot;text/javascript&quot;; po.async = true; po.src = &quot;http://d15mj6e6qmt1na.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js&quot;; var s = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;)[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(po, s); })();&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T10:08:52.218Z\">at 11.08am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50850f69c0e343ef1abc7e08\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T09:18:34.028Z\">10.18am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Security raids in Lebanon</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Lebanese army raided <a href=\"http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Politics/2012/Oct-22/192282-casualties-in-beirut-clashes-following-hasan-funeral.ashx#ixzz2A17DdH00\">suspected militant hideouts in several areas on Beirut\u2019s outskirts after last night's sectarian clashes</a>, the Daily Star reports.</p> <p>Its sources said fighting only stopped at about 2am when the army intervened.</p> <p>Friday's bomb attack is likely to be the <a href=\"http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Politics/2012/Oct-22/192291-killing-of-security-chief-raises-fears-for-lebanon.ashx#ixzz2A18mxRml\">most destabilising event in Lebanon since the 2005 assassination of former prime minister Rafik al-Hariri</a>, according to the paper's Samia Nakhoul.</p> <p>But she adds: \"Although sectarian tensions are high, Lebanese factions have no desire to return to civil war.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-7909659b-9e9e-43a8-8df1-5a43eef70886\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/22/1350897495809/e2771e1a-9831-4d9b-a501-444156c3fab3-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Lebanese soldiers gather with their weapons in Kaskas, Beirut after a night of tension following the funeral of an intelligence official killed by a car bomb.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lebanese soldiers gather with their weapons in Kaskas, Beirut after a night of tension following the funeral of an intelligence official killed by a car bomb.

There's much to catch up on, so here's a summary of the latest news and analysis:</p> <h2>Lebanon</h2> <p>\u2022 <strong><a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/six-wounded-in-lebanon-clashes-overnight-8220028.html\">Overnight clashes in Beirut between Sunni and Shia gunmen have wounded at least six people, AP reports, amid fears that the conflict in Syria is spreading to Lebanon in the wake of Friday's bomb attack in Beirut. </a></strong>The killing of Wissam al-Hassan, head of Lebanon's internal security forces in the bombing has provoked worried discussion in Damascus, according to the National. <a href=\"http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/middle-east/syrians-fear-their-war-is-spreading-and-will-destroy-us-and-lebanon\">\"It is a clear signal that our war is spreading</a>, it will destroy us and I'm sorry to say it will destroy Lebanon too,\" said Abu Anas, a middle-aged man from a besieged Damascus suburb.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/21/lebanese-clash-intelligence-chief-funeral\">The Lebanese president, Michel Sleiman, told mourners at Hassan's funeral that he had ordered a rapid investigation into the killing. </a></strong>Within an hour of the funeral, protesters drawn mostly Hassan's Sunni Muslim community began attacking security forces and attempted to storm the office of the prime minister, Najib Mikati, before rubber bullets and teargas forced them back from the barricades. They consider Mikati\u2019s government to be in league with Syria over the attack.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20024519\">US secretary of state Hillary Clinton told Lebanon that the US was willing to help investigate Friday\u2019s bomb attack, the BBC reports. </a></strong>Clinton spoke to Mikati after the funeral. A spokeswoman for the state department said: \"She noted the importance of political leaders working together at this sensitive time to ensure that calm prevails and that those responsible for the attack are brought to justice.\u201d</p> <h2>Syria</h2> <p>\u2022 <strong><a href=\"http://sana.sy/eng/21/2012/10/22/448279.htm\">President Bashar al-Assad suggested he would only back a ceasefire if western and Arab countries stopped helping the armed struggle against his government.</a></strong> After talks with international envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, the state news agency Sana said Assad insisted that \u201cany initiative or political process should be essentially based on the principle of halting terrorism and what is required in this regard from the countries involved in supporting, arming and harbouring the terrorists in Syria to halt such acts\".</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/10/22/uk-syria-crisis-idUKBRE89K07E20121022\"><strong>Thirteen people were killed when a car bomb was set off in Damascus during Brahimi\u2019s visit.</strong> </a>&#xa0;The bomb exploded outside a police station in the mainly Christian central Bab Touma district.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/21/west-policy-syria-failure-russia-iran\">By backing one side in a civil war that neither side can win, the west's policy on Syria is failing on a monumental scale, according to former Labour minister Peter Hain.</a></strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The only way forward is to broker a political settlement, with Russia using its leverage to ensure that Assad negotiates seriously \u2026</p> <p>However unpalatable, Assad may have to be granted immunity in order to get him to sign up and stop his barbarity. All state employees, including those in the armed forces, must be allowed to keep their posts, to avoid a repeat of the chaos caused by America's de-Ba'athification in Iraq. A Yemen-type process may even figure. There, a hated president did not resign but did not stand for re-election. A coalition government of national unity could then prepare for Syrian elections, due in 2014.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 <strong><a href=\"http://www.joshualandis.com/blog/?p=15984\">The US should change the balance of power in Syria by supplying rebels with anti-aircraft weapons, according to Syria watcher Joshua Landis who until now has resisted US involvement in the conflict.</a></strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The supply of portable heat-seeking missiles seems to be increasingly justified. US politicians fear that elements of the Syrian opposition may misuse ground to air missiles, but surely they cannot be misused more than Assad\u2019s jets and helicopters. Assad\u2019s air superiority, combined with his inability to rule Syria, is causing endless misery. Air power is so destructive that if it could be denied to both sides, surely fewer people would be killed.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Jordan</h2> <p>\u2022 <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/21/jordan-claims-thwarted-terror-attacks\">The authorities claim to have foiled an al-Qaida-inspired plot using arms from Syria to target western diplomats, foreign nationals and shopping centres.</a></strong> A Jordanian government spokesman Sameeh Maaytah said all 11 suspects are in police custody.

The EU budget settlement had to be \"rigorous\", he said.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Cameron has sidestepped questions about whether a no vote in the referendum he is proposing on a renegotiated relationship with the EU would lead to Britain leaving the EU.</strong> Although he has not formally committed himself to a referendum, he has said that he wants to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the EU and that a referendum would then be the simplest way of obtaining public consent for that. During the statement, two Tory MPs, Peter Bone and Mark Reckless, asked if a no vote would lead to Britain leaving the EU or whether it would be an \"in/in\" referendum, with a no vote endorsing the status quo. Cameron refused to answer.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Ed Miliband has accused Cameron of weakening Britain's influence within the EU.</strong> In his response to Cameron, Miliband said <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/18/us-eu-britain-finland-idUSBRE89H19J20121018\">Finland's Europe minister, an Anglophile, complained at the EU summit that Britain was waving goodbye to the EU.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prime minister does not seem to realise that all his bluster about fighting for Britiain is meaningless if he alienates our natural supporters ... He really has become the guy who goes to Europe and picks a fight in an empty room - which is just as well because he normally finds himself in an empty room ...</p> <p>The reality is he has lost control of his party on Europe. We have a prime minister outside the room looking in at Britain's empty seat at the table. There's one thing that our allies in Europe and the British people can agree on: his government's a shambles and it's Britain that suffers.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Philip Dunne, a defence minister, has told MPs that Scotland could lose Royal Navy defence contracts if it went independent.</strong> This is what he said when he was asked about the matter at defence questions.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The UK has not built a complex warship outside these shores since the second world war; we remain committed to using UK industry to build UK warships.</p> <p>In the unlikely event that Scotland should decide to separate from the UK, the Scottish defence industry would only be eligible to bid for contracts placed by a future Scottish government, or competed for outside the UK, placed by the UK or other governments.

Redistribution won\u2019t do it. Just 21 per cent want the government to \u201cdo far more to help the poor,\u201d while 27 per cent, would prefer the opposite\u2014cutting welfare payments \u201cbecause the poor should take more responsibility for themselves.\u201d Loyalists prefer redistribution to welfare cuts by two-to-one.</p> <p>There is one radical policy that most defectors support. A law limiting maximum pay to \u00a31m a year is supported by 58 per cent. But two right-wing policies are at least as popular: 59 per cent of defectors want Britain to leave the EU, and a huge 78 per cent want \u201cnet immigration reduced to zero\u201d.</p> <p>Equally, though, activists who reassure themselves that Labour\u2019s core supporters reject such views should think again. As many as 41 per cent of loyalists also want Britain out of the EU, and two-thirds of them back zero net immigration. One of the key findings from this analysis is that Labour defectors generally hold more right-wing views than many party activists like to think\u2014but so do millions of Labour loyalists.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://dpmcbride.tumblr.com/\">\u2022 Damian McBride on his blog says David Cameron should learn from the mistakes Gordon Brown made when he tried to get his government out of crisis mode.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>First, [Cameron] \u2013 like Gordon \u2013 is trying to announce his way out of the crisis, going into each Sunday morning and each PMQs with a fresh attempt to get on top of the news agenda with some random, focus group designed announcement. At its very least, this is a waste of potentially good stories and speeches which should be held back until there\u2019s a chance of them being heard; worse, it leads to the bungled announcement of half-baked policies, like the fuel bills balls-up; and worse still, it leads to ridiculous headlines like \u201cCameron: Now Mug A Hoodie\u201d.</p> <p>Second, he and his team are fighting forest fires with buckets of sand, when what they need is proper firebreaks, i.e. moments when the pre-existing political news agenda is suspended (or at least turned into a backdrop) while another issue or event comes to the fore. It could be a Budget, a Queen\u2019s Speech, a trip to Washington, a Defence White Paper: anything which obliges the political media to focus their attention elsewhere for a few days, not least \u2013 to put it crudely \u2013 if they want to get an exclusive preview. So where are the Coalition\u2019s firebreaks? The only one I can see on the horizon is George Osborne\u2019s Autumn Statement on 5th December; that feels a long time away.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/danhodges/100185933/boris-johnson-the-obama-campaigns-secret-weapon/\">\u2022 Dan Hodges on his blog says Boris Johnson is now featuring in one of Barack Obama\u2019s ads attacking Mitt Romney.</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/gavyndavies/#axzz2A2PRFsja\">\u2022 Gavyn Davies on his FT blog explains why the latest thinking from the IMF about fiscal multipliers is so important.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The [IMF] authors believe that this is because the fiscal multipliers have turned out to be higher than was assumed when the austerity programmes were designed. In fact, they suggest that the multiplier under current circumstances might be as large as 0.9-1.7, compared to the initial assumption of 0.5.</p> <p>If true, the implication of this would be critical. If the multiplier is 0.5, then an initial public expenditure reduction of 1 per cent of GDP reduces real output by 0.5 per cent. Using normal rules of thumb, this drop in output would in turn reduce taxation or increase public transfers by about 0.2 per cent of GDP, leaving the budget deficit improving by 0.8 per cent of GDP. This ratio of budget improvement to reduced growth might be just about acceptable to democratic governments.</p> <p>If, however, the multiplier is 1.7, then the same initial public spending cut of 1 per cent of GDP would reduce real output by 1.7 per cent. The second round effects of this reduction in output would reduce tax or raise transfers by 0.68 per cent. The net overall improvement in the budget deficit would therefore be only 0.32 per cent. The economy would be in recession, and the budget deficit would hardly improve at all. Even if this were acceptable to governments, it would not be acceptable for very long to their electorates.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T14:48:59.349Z\">at 3.48pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5085523a58f96784ee2908c6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T14:08:09.268Z\">3.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I've already posted some reaction to the David Cameron speech (or pre-reaction, because it was available before the full text of the speech was published). See 10.57am. Here's some more.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/andrew-neilson/prison-david-cameron-speech_b_1999766.html?utm_hp_ref=uk\">From Andrew Neilson, director of campaigns at the Howard League for Penal Reform</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is all very well to pay providers by results but you must have a result that is meaningful in the first place.</p> <p>The Ministry of Justice is looking at paying providers on whether individuals are reconvicted or not but this is a blunt measure that does not reflect the reality of how people desist from crime. Rather than simply shift from offending to not offending like an electrical switch, people who offend tend to lead chaotic lives and slip in and out of trouble with the law.</p> <p>Sometimes progress is better measured in whether people are reoffending less seriously or less frequently than before. But that kind of progress would not be measured under current proposals, which raises questions as to what success any providers will be able to produce.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.rapt.org.uk/news22102012.html\">From Mike Trace, chief executive of the Rehabilitation for Addicted Prisoners Trust</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We welcome that David Cameron has made clear his determination to focus on \u2018making prison work\u2019 using effective rehabilitation, but this policy will only work if the government scales up its commitment to drug and alcohol rehabilitation programmes in prisons that actually succeed in reducing reoffending. It is clear from our analysis that ensuring prisoners get access to good quality drug treatment programmes will significantly help deliver the results he seeks.</p> <p>An intensive recovery approach cuts costs as well as crime. For every 100 individuals, the RAPt programme saves \u00a36.3 million on re-sentencing and re-incarcerating. This would equate to savings of \u00a3440 million a year if the programme was offered to just 10% of drug dependent prisoners.</p> </blockquote> <p>From Rhodri Davies, policy manager at the Charities Aid Foundation</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prime minister is right that payment by results contracts have potential to help charities use their expertise to tackle intractable social problems such as reoffending.</p> <p>But ministers need to improve the way these contracts are designed so charities are not simply squeezed out in favour of large private sector providers. Most charities simply cannot afford to take on contracts to tackle social problems without up-front funding because they are not allowed to carry large financial reserves and have limited access to capital compared to for-profit businesses.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T14:13:00.309Z\">at 3.13pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50854e4a58f96784ee2908c4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T13:46:51.036Z\">2.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's a Guardian video with an extract from Cameron's speech.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/video/2012/oct/22/david-cameron-crime-punishment-video\"                                data-show-ads=\"true\"                        data-video-name=\"David Cameron on crime: 'Offenders need and deserve punishment' - video\"                        > <object width=\"460\" height=\"307\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"></param><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/video/embed\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><param name=\"flashvars\" value=\"endpoint=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/video/2012/oct/22/david-cameron-crime-punishment-video/json\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/video/embed\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" flashvars=\"endpoint=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/video/2012/oct/22/david-cameron-crime-punishment-video/json\" wmode=\"opaque\"></embed></object> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5085407dc0e343ef1abc7e21\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T13:24:20.524Z\">2.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Lunchtime summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20022794\">David Cameron has claimed that being \"tough but intelligent\" will be the hallmark of his approach to law and order</a>.</strong> In a wide-ranging speech on law and order which he used to announce the extension of payment-by-results prisoner rehabilitation, Cameron said that the best approach to criminal justice combined punishment with rehabilitation. \"It's not a case of 'prison works' or 'prison doesn't work' - we need to make prison work,\" he said.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Cameron has dismissed some of the government's recent difficulties as \"processology\" and said that he is focusing on the \"big picture\".</strong> This is what he said when asked about claims that the government was losing its grip.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We need to focus on the big picture. What actually happened last week is that unemployment fell, inflation fell, waiting lists in our hospitals fell, crime fell, the right decision was made about Gary McKinnon. Those are the important things that are happening in an economy where we've created a million private sector jobs in the last two years.

I thought the right thing to do was to make sure there was a proper apology.</p> <p>The police didn't want to take it further but it did become apparent he wasn't going to be able to do his job so the right conclusion was reached.

Around 45% of the inmates are currently in drug or alcohol rehabilitation programmes. <br>The visit allowed the prime minister to view first hand a group putting into action his vision of charities, voluntary groups and private companies providing rehabilitation services to help turn prisoners' lives around and stop them reoffending. <br>Cameron insisted that a lack of money was not an issue in bringing down the reoffending rate, saying that extending payment-by-results schemes for those helping to rehabilitate prisoners would refocus existing resources. <br>In one of the prison's courtyards, the prime minister said: \"We have got to do more for less, every place here costs \u00a340,000, there are 600 staff that work in this prison - it's not a shortage of money, it's that we haven't been focusing people on what really matters, which is the results.\" <br>Asked if it was a gamble to use private companies and charities to plug gaps, Cameron said: \"We spend billions of pounds on prison and probation but we are not getting the right results. <br>\"In terms of getting charities to do more, it's happening now. I've just been sitting in a cell with a very good drug rehab charity that's working with prisoners trying to get them off drugs, get them clean. <br>\"If that works then that prisoner won't be costing us all that money, won't be robbing houses and causing chaos and won't be returning to our prison system.\"</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-9f14c585-3a7f-4311-94c3-0060b4b1aecc\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/22/1350910653478/fea47c7f-4c26-47af-a337-3c8a26077c50-460.jpeg\" alt=\"David Cameron at Wormwood Scrubs\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Britain's prime minister David Cameron (right) is escorted by prison governor Phil Taylor as he arrives at Wormwood Scrubs prison in west London on 22 October 2012.

But, as a speech, it did not really pass the \"new\" test at all. Cameron has been talking about the need for better rehabilitation and the advantages of payment-by-results for years and, although he did announce a national roll-out today, the whole point of piloting these programmes is to pave the way for national implementation, and so this did not come as a huge surprise.

rhetoric about reducing crime.</p> <p>And, while Tony Blair had all the resources of Government behind him in 1997 to deliver his tough on crime tough on the causes of crime policy, we no longer have that luxury \u2013 and even with all the resources, Blair gave us 3,000 new criminal offences, 25,000 more prisoners and he failed to address entirely the Tough on the Causes of Crime part of the policy at all.</p> <p>Blair left us with even more of the high-crime, inner-city housing estates that existed when he came to power, and with precisely the same degree of unemployment, school exclusions, poor parenting, drug misuse and gang cultures existing when he left.</p> <p>Forced by a lack of resources to fund his policy Cameron is turning to the private and voluntary sector to help him deliver his \u2018Tough But Intelligent\u2019 policy to be announced later today, relying on a \u2018Payments By Results\u2019 method of funding it \u2013 but behind the scenes I can tell you there are huge arguments about what the \u2018Payment By Results\u2019 mechanism actually means \u2013 what \u2018results\u2019 amount to \u2018results\u2019, who assesses those \u2018results\u2019 and what level of \u2018payment\u2019 are we talking about here?</p> </blockquote> <p>From Vicki Helyar-Cardwell, director of the Criminal Justice Alliance</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This speech was an opportunity to regain the momentum promised at the start of the coalition government to drive forward a genuine rehabilitation revolution to cut crime, prioritise prevention and reduce the damaging levels of reoffending. The danger is the intelligent bit gets lost at the expense of sounding tough.</p> <p>A truly smart approach would be to focus on offenders making amends for their wrongdoing, treating drug and alcohol addictions that can fuel crime and getting ex-offenders back into real work. Much of this relies on wider society \u2013 organisations and people outside of the criminal justice system. The real strength of the Prime Minister\u2019s 2006 so-called \u2018hug a hoodie speech\u2019 is that it recognised that criminal justice and social justice are inextricably linked. Yet several years on, the criminal justice system still often picks up the pieces when others have failed, the high levels of children in care who end up in our youth justice system are a telling example of this ...</p> <p>Criminal Justice Alliance organisations, working in prisons and with offenders and their families in the community, report that prison overcrowding and budget cuts mean rehabilitation is being undermined. Making governors more accountable for what happens after prison is welcome, but this will backfire without efforts to curb huge prison overcrowding that blights much of the positive work in prisons. Overcrowding extracts a heavy price from prisoners, prison staff and voluntary sector working to cut reoffending, and ultimately harms communities to which ex-prisoners will return.</p> <p>The Prime Minister\u2019s speech comes the week after the Chief Inspector of Prisons said that in order to deliver a rehabilitation revolution, government needs to reduce numbers of people in prison or invest more in prison budgets.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2012/10/cameron-tries-to-avoid-crisis-management-with-tough-crime-announcement/\">From Isabel Hardman at Coffee House</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s clear the government has had a bad week when the Prime Minister pops up on a Monday with a crowd-pleasing policy announcement. Recent re-launches have been shared by senior Lib Dems and Tories following the collapse of Lords reform, for example, to demonstrate that the Coalition is still working well. But today, the Lib Dems are nowhere to be seen: the Prime Minister\u2019s big crime announcement is a response to a terrible week for the Conservative party, rather than the coalition as a whole.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/thetorydiary/2012/10/toughbutintelligent.html\">From Tim Montgomerie at ConservativeHome</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The speech is being presented by some in the media as a response to the Government\u2019s difficult week but, in reality, the speech and whole approach has long been in the pipeline. Chris Grayling was thinking about a rehabilitation revolution when he was Shadow Home Secretary.

I've taken the quotes from<a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com\"> PoliticsHome.</a></p> <p><strong>\u2022 Grayling said that too many prisoners were released without being given help to stop them reoffending.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The reality at the moment, all too often, is that we release somebody on to the streets after prison, with \u00a346 in their pocket, relatively little, if any, support. Probation officers do good work with those who have been in prison for longer periods; those who\u2019ve been in prison for shorter periods get no support at all.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-14028358\">a pilot payment-by-results rehabilitation scheme in Peterborough</a> had been a success.</strong> He had been to visit this scheme, he said. \"First indications are very encouraging,\" he went on. \"We get the detailed statistics this month, but from what I\u2019ve seen so far, I\u2019m very encouraged that it does indeed work.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said he wanted private companies and charities to be involved in running payment-by-results rehabilitation programmes.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He rejected suggestions that providers would be incentivised to fiddle the figures.</strong> \"In many ways the measurements for payment-by-results in criminal justice are very binary,\" he said. \"Do you reoffend or don\u2019t you? if you're back in court, back in a police cell, then it\u2019s not worked and the providers don\u2019t get paid.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said former offenders could play an important role in rehabilitation programmes.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019ve seen examples in community projects of former offenders, perhaps former gang members, mentoring younger offenders to say, \u2018Well look, I\u2019ve been through it all, I\u2019ve gone straight - there\u2019s a better place to be.' That can be enormously powerful, and you\u2019ve got a lot of that in the voluntary sector.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that, having promoted payment-by-results in the work programme as welfare minister, he was keen to apply the same principle in the justice system.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said it was \"very silly\" of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20020451\">Lord Blair, the former Metropolitan police commissioner, to say that people should not vote in the police commissioner elections</a></strong>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think it\u2019s a very silly thing to say.

That is just a \"sterile debate\", he will say. See 9.07am. (Unfortunately, this passage of the speech just sounds like a pale imitation of Tony Blair's \"tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime\". Cameron might have been better just adopting that slogan wholesale.)</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He will say that criminals deserve \"retribution\".</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Retribution is not a dirty word, it is important to society that revulsion against crime is properly recognised.</p> </blockquote> <p>(The use of the word \"retribution\" is <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2220757/David-Cameron-PM-promises-seek-retribution-law-breakers-new-anti-crime-crackdown.html\">one of the elements of the speech that excited the Mail on Sunday </a>because of its Old Testament overtones, but Cameron just seems to be using it as another word for punishment.)</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He will say that prisoners need rehabilitation because \"being tough isn't a successful strategy in itself\".</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Come with me to any prison in this country.</p> <p>There you\u2019ll meet muggers, robbers, and burglars.</p> <p>But you\u2019ll also meet young men who can\u2019t read, teenagers on drugs, people who\u2019ve never worked a day in their life.</p> <p>These people need help so they can become part of the solution and not remain part of the problem.</p> <p>Recognising this isn\u2019t soft, or liberal.</p> <p>It\u2019s common sense.</p> <p>We\u2019ll never create a safer society unless we give people, especially young people, opportunities and chances away from crime.</p> <p>Prevention is the cheapest and most effective way to deal with crime \u2013 everything else is simply picking up the pieces of failure that has gone before.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He will say the government will extend \"payment-by-results\" as a means of providing prisoner rehabilitation.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When this government came to power we were spending \u00a340,000 a year just on banging people up.</p> <p>With payment by results, your money goes into what works\u2026</p> <p>\u2026prisoners going straight, crime coming down, our country getting safer.</p> <p>It\u2019s such a good idea I want to put rocket boosters under it\u2026</p> <p>\u2026indeed today I have an announcement to make.</p> <p>By the end of 2015, I want to see payment by results spread right across rehabilitation.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He will say that rehabilitation programmes will be offered to prisoners serving short sentences, not just to offenders who have been jailed for a year or more, as happens now.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He will say that tackling crime is part of the \"aspiration nation\" agenda he set out in his party conference speech.</strong> \"We will not rise as a country if we leave millions behind and write off whole communities,\" he will say.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T09:05:34.473Z\">at 10.05am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5084fea658f96784ee2908a0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T08:07:02.151Z\">9.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>David Cameron is going to give a speech on law and order later today and in it he is going to complain that politicians who speak on criminal justice are either portrayed as authoritarian, bang-\u2019em-up merchants or soppy liberals.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For many people, I\u2019m the person associated with those three words, two of which begin with \u2018H\u2019, and one of which is \u2018hoodie\u2019\u2026</p> <p>\u2026even though I never actually said it.</p> <p>For others, I\u2019m the politician who has argued for tough punishment.</p> <p>So do I take a tough line on crime \u2013 or a touchy-feely one?</p> <p>In no other public debate do the issues get polarised like this.</p> <p>On climate change you don\u2019t have to be in denial or campaigning to get every car off the road.</p> <p>Life isn\u2019t that simple \u2013 so government policy isn\u2019t that simple.</p> <p>And yet with the crime debate, people seem to want it black or white.</p> <p>Lock \u2018em up or let \u2018em out.</p> <p>Blame the criminal or blame society.</p> <p>\u2018Be tough\u2019 or \u2018act soft\u2019.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cameron will argue that this binary approach is simplistic and he will say that he wants to \u201cmove the debate on\u201d.

  "<p>Monday brings the final debate. Heading into it, the story remains the same as it was yesterday, last week, and the week before last. President Obama and Mitt Romney remain tied in the national race. The issue for Romney is that, at this point, he lacks a viable path to 270 electoral votes for an electoral college win or 269 for a tie. Why?</p> <p>I previously outlined <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/16/romney-routes-victory-battleground-states\">three electoral paths</a> for Romney to get to the White House. The scenarios all gave Romney states in which he was leading or tied including the close states of Colorado, Florida, and Virginia. The states where polls indicated that Romney was down but could close were Iowa (6 electoral votes), Nevada (6 electoral votes), New Hampshire (4 electoral votes), Ohio (18 electoral votes), and Wisconsin (10 electoral votes). All Romney had to do was add enough of these \"winnable\" states to his 257 electoral vote baseline in order to win. </p> <p>Romney has seemingly made progress in two of these states: Iowa and New Hampshire. Public Policy Polling actually found Romney ahead by a point this week in <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/ia/iowa_romney_vs_obama-1922.html\">Iowa</a> and his deficit is down to 2.4 in the Real Clear Politics average. Iowa political guru <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2012/10/19/david_yepsen_romney_is_closing_in_iowa.html\">David Yepsen</a> says Romney is closing fast, and NBC's Chuck Todd says <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chucktodd/status/260049974279172096\">internal polling</a> has the race very tight in the Hawkeye state.</p> <p>This weekend, I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/20/mitt-romney-new-hampshire\">wrote on the emergence of New Hampshire</a> possibly coming into the Romney column as well. Mitt Romney actually leads in the <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/nh/new_hampshire_romney_vs_obama-2030.html\">Real Clear Politics average</a> in the Granite state. Romney also has started to pull ahead in some of the <a href=\"http://www.redracinghorses.com/showComment.do?commentId=167816\">internal New Hampshire polls</a>.</p> <p>Romney's problem is that even adding Iowa and New Hampshire to his column leaves him at 267 electoral votes. At this point, he hasn't been able to move the dial in either Nevada, Ohio, or Wisconsin. </p> <p>Nevada looks to be Romney's toughest challenge. The <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/nv/nevada_romney_vs_obama-1908.html\">Real Clear Politics average</a> now has Romney down 3 points in the Silver state, which includes a 2-point Obama gain in a SurveyUSA and 3-point Obama gain in a Rasmussen survey. Democrats are <a href=\"http://www.therepublic.com/view/story/ffb40fccb5414d53bf6daac19dab441d/NV--Early-Voting-Nevada\">exceeding expectations</a> in the early vote to such an extent that even Bush campaign veteran <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adrian_gray/status/260182860076564480\">Adrian Gray</a> conceded that he was unhappy about the numbers coming out of Las Vegas. It just doesn't look good for team Romney here. </p> <p>Ohio is another state where Romney hasn't closed the gap since the immediate aftermath of the first debate. As Nate Cohn <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/blog/electionate/108927/the-five-things-you-need-know-about-obamas-lead-in-ohio-polls\">pointed out</a>, Obama's lead is only on average 0.25 points smaller than two weeks ago for an average lead of about 2 points. You see one pollster such as Public Policy Polling showing Romney gaining 4 points in the last two weeks, but you also have Obama expanding his leading by 2 points during the same period, according to SurveyUSA. The latest <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/22/ohio-race-tightens-in-new-poll/\">Quinnipiac poll has the gap closing, but Obama maintaining a 5-point lead</a>; and this one poll will not significantly shift Obama's average lead.</p> <p>Wisconsin is much the same story. Romney is only about 2.5 points behind on average, yet there isn't much movement in the polls. As I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/17/gallup-poll-wisconsin-harry-enten\">wrote last week</a>, Obama is at about 49%, leaving little room for Romney, even if he were to capture all the undecided vote. </p> <p>The question is whether Monday's debate will help Romney close or Obama widen his lead in the key states. I tend to doubt it for three reasons. </p> <p>First, the topic is not the economy: the No 1 issue of the campaign. Rather, it is foreign policy, which <a href=\"http://www.pollingreport.com/prioriti.htm\">only about 5% of voters</a> list as the leading issue. The president has the edge on foreign policy in most polls. Romney, however, has <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203630604578070354133512978.html\">closed the gap</a> in a <a href=\"http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2012/10/19/Pew-Romney-closes-gap-on-foreign-policy/UPI-42221350656476/\">number of recent surveys</a> and will likely be seen as good enough that a lack of foreign policy experience isn't going to harm him tremendously.</p> <p>Second, neither candidate has much to gain with their base. Heading into the first debate, Republican <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/17/hofstra-presidential-debate-instapolls-obama-romney\">enthusiasm was down</a>. After Obama's recovery in the second debate, Republicans and Democrats are now about equally enthusiastic about their candidate. It would take a dominating performance \u2013 or a major gaffe \u2013 for either candidate to lose base support now. </p> <p>Third, historically, the <a href=\"http://blogs.middlebury.edu/presidentialpower/2012/10/21/yes-jim-fallows-debates-do-matter-but-not-as-much-as-you-may-think/\">third debate has had little impact</a>. The average change in margin since 1988 just before the third debate and after is only about a point, compared with 2 points for the first debate. This small effect likely has to do with the fact that the third debate takes place very late in the campaign, and there is little the candidates can do now that would be all that surprising.</p> <p>The only factor that does make me doubt this analysis is that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/13/baseball-politics-st-louis-cardinals\">this year has not been one that has followed the rules</a>. We'll have to watch tonight's debate and the days following to see if it does, indeed, make a difference. For now, we can say the president remains the electoral college favorite.</p>",
  "<p>Fidel Castro has proved he is not only alive but still kicking with a scathing attack on the \"imperialist media\" for spreading rumours that he was either dead or in a neuro-vegetative state.</p> <p>Accompanying a photograph of him reading last Friday's edition of the Cuban Communist party newspaper, the 86-year-old revolutionary issued a personal health bulletin in which he described reports that he had suffered a stroke as \"nonsense\" and claimed he did not even suffer from headaches.</p> <p>The article \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.cubadebate.cu/fidel-castro-ruz/2012/10/22/fidel-castro-esta-agonizando/\" title=\"\">sarcastically entitled \"Fidel Castro is in his death throes\"</a> \u2013 followed a week of rumours about Castro's demise, following his apparent failure to publicly congratulate his ally and friend Hugo Ch\u00e1vez for winning the Venezuelan presidential election on 7 October.</p> <p>The former president of Cuba had not been seen in public since March, when he met Pope Benedict, and had not made a statement since June, when he published the last of what had been a regular column called Reflections.</p> <p>Since he handed power to his brother, Ra\u00fal, in 2006 citing health reasons, there have been repeated false alarms about Fidel Castro's health. But the speculation hit a new level of intensity last week thanks to social networks, the Cuban diaspora and a doctor who claimed to have inside information.</p> <p>Jos\u00e9 Marquina reportedly lives in Spain, practises in Florida and is neither a specialist in oncology nor neurology, but was widely quoted as saying Castro was in a neuro-vegetative state. \"He has suffered an embolic stroke and recognises absolutely no one,\" he told reporters last week.</p> <p>Marquina \u2013 who says he has close connections inside the Venezuelan medical community \u2013 gained a huge online following earlier in the year for reports that Ch\u00e1vez's cancer had spread to his liver, which would make it difficult for him to campaign. His comments on both leaders have been carried by the Miami Herald and Spain's rightwing ABC newspaper among others.</p> <p>Last week, Castro's children and the Cuban government dismissed the rumours of a deadly or debilitating stroke as \"absurd\". On Thursday, the Cuban media published a congratulatory message from Castro to a medical school on its 50th anniversary. At the weekend, the former Venezuelan vice-president El\u00edas Jaua said he had met Castro for five hours and showed photographs of the encounter in Havana.</p> <p>\"He had the courtesy of bringing me to the hotel,\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/21/fidel-castro-appearance-cuba\" title=\"\">Jaua told Associated Press</a>, adding that Castro looked \"very well\". Staff at the Hotel Nacional said the former president's health was \"great\" and that he was \"coherent and affectionate\" to employees.</p> <p>This failed to quash the rumours, especially after Castro failed to vote in person during Sunday's municipal elections.</p> <p>The state-run Trabajadores newspaper reported that Castro had sent in an absentee ballot from his home \u2013 a right it said was extended to all citizens with \"impediments\".</p> <p>\"I don't understand anything. If they said #FidelCastro was at Hotel Nacional, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yoanisanchez/status/260169854454231041\" title=\"\">why didn't he go to the Electoral College, to vote</a>?\" asked a dissident blogger, Yoani Sanchez, in a tweet.</p> <p>Castro has now waded directly into the debate with a strident article that characteristically goes far beyond suggesting reports of his death have been somewhat exaggerated.</p> <p>\"Although many people are taken in by the mass media, almost all of which are in the hands of the privileged and wealthy who publish this nonsense, fewer and fewer believe in them,\" he wrote, singling out the \"Venezuelan doctor\" and ABC for criticism.</p> <p>Castro said Cuba had been the victim of a misinformation campaign for more than half a century, referring to the recent 50th anniversary of the Cuban Missile Crisis.</p> <p>Less characteristic was his self-effacing explanation for why he stopped writing a regular column. \"I stopped writing Reflections because it is no longer my role to fill up newspaper pages that should be devoted to other national tasks,\" he said.</p> <p>He signed off with a final poke at those who reported his demise. \"I don't even remember what it feels like to have a headache,\" he writes. \"To prove how much they lie, see the photos accompanying this article.\"</p> <p>The images are credited to his son Alex. One shows him raising his arm in an orchard, wearing a red and blue check shirt, a broad-brimmed straw hat and supported by a metal walking stick. In another, he is reading Friday's edition of Granma.</p> <p>On Monday morning, residents of Havana said they had also seen TV images of Castro at home.</p> <p>\"Last week, I thought he was dead. That's what everyone on the street was saying. But today on TV, he was very well,\" said Carmen Gonce, a retired journalist. \"In Cuba, we are great fantasists. People say many things. Sometimes they are true. Sometimes they are not.\"</p> <h2>Undead Again</h2> <p>Fidel Castro may well hold the world record for not dying in the face of rumours insisting otherwise.</p> <p>In 1957, the New York Times ran a piece declaring: \"Castro is alive.\" It followed a two-month silence by Castro, then described as the \"rebel leader of Cuba's youth\" against General Batista. \"Because of the complete censorship, Havana and the other Cuban cities crackle with the most astonishing rumours. One constantly encouraged by the government has been that Fidel Castro is dead,\" the correspondent noted.</p> <p>The rumours have continued on and off ever since, rising in intensity as Castro aged.</p> <p>In 2004, under the headline: \"Rumours of Castro's death sweep Miami-Dade \u2013 again,\" the Miami Herald said the Cuban expatriate community was abuzz with rumours that Castro had died or suffered a stroke, following comments by the mayor of Bogota that he appeared to be \"very sick\" during their meeting. The Cuban American National Foundation said it received 100 calls about Castro's demise.</p> <p>\"It's wishful thinking,\" the executive director, Joe Garcia, told the paper. \"But it's got to be right some time.\"</p> <p>In 2007, the blogger known as Perez Hilton claimed that an announcement about Castro's death would be released at 4pm on 24 August. The rumour was based on a drill by the Miami police department for the street parties they are expecting when Castro dies. The chief of police in Miami denied his forces were on alert. \"Since I've been here, Fidel has died four times already,\" he told the Wall Street Journal.</p>",

Welcome to Nevada.</p> <p>An unprecedented blizzard of political ads \u2013 10,000 a week \u2013 has howled through the state's airwaves, setting a national record in volume, money and, many would say, nastiness.</p> <p>\"We've never seen it at this level before. The market is just saturated,\" said Dan McElhatten, executive creative director at Brand, a Las Vegas advertising firm. \"At this point people are confused. This level of banter is going to numb society.\"</p> <p>A combination of factors has made Nevada the fiercest media front in a year that is <a href=\" http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/16/us/politics/never-to-be-outdone-vegas-sets-record-for-political-ads.html?hp&amp;_r=\" 1&amp;amp\";\">expected to set a new record</a> \u2013 $3.3bn, up from $2.8bn in 2008 \u2013 for nationwide political advertising.</p> <p>It has just six electoral college votes but as a swing state in a tight presidential contest it could be decisive, giving the Barack Obama and Mitt Romney campaigns plenty of incentive to hammer each other.</p> <p>Nevada also has a tight senate race, which Republicans and Democrats think could tip control of the Senate, as well as elections for the House, all on the 6 November ballot.</p> <p>The fact that most of Nevada's population is clustered in and around just two cities, Las Vegas and Reno, makes it relatively cheap for candidates and Super Pac allies to buy copious airtime.</p> <p>\"My God, does it ever stop?\" groaned Samuel Sanchez, 44, jogging on a Las Vegas hotel gym treadmill and watching yet another interruption of the quiz show Jeopardy. \"On and on and on.\"</p> <p>Cities in other swing states such as Ohio, Florida and Colorado have also been saturated but none as heavily as Las Vegas, which has notched up 73,000 ads so far this year.</p> <p>Television stations have scaled back programming, including news, to sell more airtime while the bonanza lasts. \"Before there would be a placement strategy, ads placed in certain places, now they're just blanketed all over the place,\" said McElhatten, the executive.</p> <p>Commentators say the volume is matched by the venom. A GOP commercial showed video of Shelley Berkley, a Democratic congresswoman running for Senate, shopping at Saks in Manhattan \u2013 she took a shine to beige stilettos \u2013 to mock her claim to return to Nevada to see recession-hit constituents every weekend. \"Actions speak louder than words, Shelley,\" it said. Another ad cast her as a near mafioso on the basis of a congressional inquiry into allegations she lobbied for her husband's financial interests.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Pnh5QKU2Skk?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Pnh5QKU2Skk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=\" player_detailpage&amp;v=\"kOZ-AwWSc3Q&quot;&quot;\">Berkley's campaign hit back</a> by trying to link Dean Heller, the Republican she hopes to unseat, to a $64m diamond scam.</p> <p>Democrats also played on Heller's former ties to a businessman who pleaded guilty to laundering drug money, and his purported desire to abolish social security and leave the elderly unprotected.</p>&lt;       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QPxHwRsU8BY?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QPxHwRsU8BY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   p&gt;An ad for John Oceguera, the Democratic nominee for the House of Representatives, accuses his Republican rival, Joe Heck, of callousness towards rape victims. <p>A woman who describes herself as a victim of sexual violence says: \"I see the fear in their eyes \u2026 For many victims of rape or abuse, it's a matter of life and death.

  "<p>Mohamed Nasheed, the former president of the Maldives, has called on tourists visiting the Indian Ocean island nation to \"be more aware\" of its political problems.</p> <p>Nasheed, a veteran human rights activist and environmental campaigner, was forced to resign in February in what he says was a coup. Nasheed had been in power since 2008, when elections ended the 30-year rule of the autocratic Abdul Mamoun Gayoom.</p> <p>A million tourists, more than half from Europe, are expected to visit the luxury destination this year, slightly more than last year. Tourism officially accounts for 30% of the Maldives' $2.1bn (\u00a31.3bn) economy, while unofficial estimates say the proportion could be much higher.</p> <p>Almost all tourists transfer directly to their resorts, mostly situated on uninhabited islands that are exempt from strict laws prohibiting alcohol in the Muslim state, which they do not leave for the duration of their stay.</p> <p>\"Tourists should be more aware of what is going on here. They may think they are remote from Male [the capital] but many of the staff are from here,\" said Nasheed, who was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/nov/25/david-cameron-answers-questions\" title=\"\">described by David Cameron</a> last November as his \"new best mate\".</p> <p>Nasheed, 45, has been critical of the international community's reaction to his ousting in February following weeks of street protests by opposition parties. He will face trial next month for ordering the detention of a senior judge while president. His supporters claim the trial is politically motivated and aimed at preventing Nasheed standing in presidential polls scheduled to be held next year.</p> <p>\"They will fix it one way or another. The whole idea is to bar me from contesting and that is what they are working at,\" Nasheed told the Guardian. Senior government officials in the administration of President Waheed Hassan, who took over from Nasheed, said the trial was \"open and transparent\". \"The government has no role in the whole process,\" said Hassan Saeed, the president's special adviser.</p> <p>Mohamed Jameel, minister of home affairs, said the charge of abducting a sitting judge was \"not political\" but \"a criminal offence\".</p> <p>Government officials also contest Nasheed's claims that he was ousted by force in a coup d'etat. \"The situation was of his own making. He violated the constitution and resigned voluntarily,\" Saeed said.</p> <p>A Commonwealth-backed Commission of National Inquiry decided the events in February did not constitute a coup. Regional powers along with diplomats in Europe and the US are watching the situation closely.</p> <p>London and Washington have made clear their regard for Nasheed, who passed a series of economic reforms and sought to counter tendencies in the Sunni Muslim country towards a more conservative form of Islam often mixed with strong anti-western sentiments.</p> <p>Indian diplomats are concerned by the possibility that their neighbours China and Pakistan could exploit the situation to increase their influence in the strategically situated islands.</p> <p>A massive budget deficit has undermined the country's public finances and seriously weakened its currency. However, economic measures introduced by Nasheed's government under pressure from the International Monetary Fund, such as new sales taxes, angered some of the business community and contributed to his fall from power, analysts say.</p> <p>However, Nasheed's Maldivian Democratic party (MDP) remains popular, particularly among the young and in urban areas, and is still the largest political organisation by some margin.</p> <p>\"Nasheed still has a very good base of support. It is difficult to predict who would win an election,\" said Moosa Latheef, the editor of the Male-based Haveeru Daily newspaper. Presidential polls are likely to be held in late summer 2013, after the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, officials say.</p>",
  "<p>When Barack Obama and Mitt Romney take to the stage in Florida on Monday night, the eyes of the Kremlin will be watching.</p> <p>Obama has presented his \"reset\" in relations with Russia as a key foreign policy success. Romney has instead called the country \"our number one geopolitical foe\".</p> <p>In Russia, where politics is seen as a dark game conducted in sealed-off rooms far from the public eye, and where Washington is seen as constantly plotting Russia's demise, the differing positions are generally viewed some amusement.</p> <p>\"Some people say it's easier to have an open guy then have a guy who in fact follows the same anti-Russian line but is hypocritical,\" said Fyodor Lukyanov, the editor of Russia in global affairs. \"For them, Obama is the same as all of them.\"</p> <p>Obama's administration has pointed to a string of successes with Russia \u2013 negotiating a new Start arms reduction treaty, co-operating on Afghanistan, getting the country into the World Trade Organisation \u2013 as an example of the president's foreign policy savvy. Yet those successes came before Vladimir Putin made anti-Americanism a foundation of his third presidential term. Since then, the US has seen its ambassador to Russia harassed, its state department blamed for creating the opposition to Putin, its aid agency expelled and a key arms clean-up agreement, Nunn-Lugar, torn to shreds.</p> <p>That has allowed Romney's advisers to call the reset a \"complete disaster\" and use the issue as one of the starkest points of difference between him and his opponent.</p> <p>Putin gave a backhanded endorsement to a Romney win last month, when he praised the Republican challenger for issuing a \"straightforward\" assessment of his views on Russia.</p> <p>\"That Mr Romney considers us enemy number one and apparently has bad feelings about Russia is a minus, but, considering that he expresses himself bluntly, openly and clearly, means that he is an open and sincere man, which is a plus,\" Putin told journalists. \"I am actually very grateful to him for formulating his position in a straightforward manner.\"</p> <p>Lukyanov said many inside Russia took the formulation with pride, a sign that Russia managed to regain a status it lost with the fall of the Soviet Union. \"It's the highest assessment of Russia since Gorbachev,\" he said. \"No one has put Russia on the same level as the US since, probably, Reagan. In this regard, it was amusing and good to hear.\"</p> <p>Yet concerns exist that for all his bluster, Romney, as president, would relegate Russia to the backburner \u2013 if there is anything the Kremlin hates more than being disliked, it is being ignored.</p> <p>\"It's clear that Romney is not anti-Russian \u2013 he doesn't know Russia, he has no interest in it, and in his case it'll most likely be same attitude as we saw in the beginning of the Bush administration, when they didn't understand why they should pay attention to this country,\" Lukyanov said.</p> <p>Many Russians have seen Romney's attacks on their country as a pre-election ploy, even the usually flamboyantly anti-American Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the nationalist LDPR party. \"This is, of course, a pre-election approach,\" Zhirinovsky said earlier this year, in an uncharacteristically calm fashion. \"But of course, Mitt Romney isn't right. Forty years ago, our army was in Europe. If the tanks start up, eardrums in all European capitals will burst,\" he added.</p> <p>Average Russians appear to be taking heed as well. According to a new poll released on Wednesday, only 4% of Russians think a Romney win would be in Russia's national interest, versus 42% who would prefer an Obama win.</p> <p>Whether it's the anti-Americanism that has flooded Russia's televisions and political speeches since Putin announced his intention to return to the presidency late last year, or Romney's statements on his view of the country, something has changed.</p> <p>The percentage of Russians who say they have a \"positive attitude\" towards the US dropped from 56% to 46% over the past 12 months, according to the Levada Centre, an independent pollster. The number of those with a \"negative attitude\" grew from 27% to 38% in the same time, it found.</p> <p>And many appear at a loss to understand what form Romney's rhetorical anti-Russia stance would take. \"People here, at least specialists, know that what Romney is saying is coming not from some especially anti-Russian stance, but mostly because of his ignorance and disinterest,\" Lukyanov said.</p> <p>\"He's collecting stereotypes which are widespread, and that's enough for him now,\" he said. \"What kind of policy he will pursue is something we don't actually know.\"</p>",
  "<p>When Barack Obama and Mitt Romney squared off in their second debate last week, the view from Beijing was not of a boxing match but \"a vanity fair for China-bashers competing to flex their muscles\", snapped a commentary for state news agency Xinhua.</p> <p>\"We hope the US Republican and Democratic candidates will get rid of the impact of election politics and do more things conducive to China-US mutual trust and cooperation,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei told reporters. </p> <p>But Monday's final debate is likely to see more panda-slugging; it includes a section on \"the rise of China and tomorrow's world\".</p> <p>On Tuesday Romney vowed to crack down on the world's second largest economy, complaining it had cheated and vowing to label it a currency manipulator on his first day as president.</p> <p>\"Governor, you're the last person who's going to get tough on China,\" retorted Obama, arguing Romney had backed companies that pioneered outsourcing and was currently investing in firms \"building surveillance equipment for China to spy on its own folks\".</p> <p>June Teufel Dreyer, an expert on Chinese politics at the University of Miami, said China had been salient in past races \u2013 Bill Clinton accused George H Bush of \"coddling dictators from Beijing to Bagdad\", for example \u2013 but seemed to be playing a larger role this year. She suggested that was a response to Chinese policy - including Beijing's confrontational behaviour in the South China and East China seas; continuing large trade surpluses and the skirting of WTO obligations; and attempts to stifle dissident voices.</p> <p>While Romney raised the issue first, the candidates \"seem to have been devoting approximately equal time\" to it, she added.</p> <p>Susan Shirk, deputy assistant secretary of state in the Clinton administration and now at the University of California-San Diego, thought China was perhaps less prominent this time, but the dynamic was familiar.</p> <p>\"Romney, like all challengers, tries to paint the current president as too soft on China. Because of the country's present economic pain, the focus is on China as an economic rather than security threat,\" she said.</p> <p>But Obama was somewhat protected because he has pursued trade complaints against China.</p> <p>\"And like all incumbents, President Obama is reluctant to trash relations with China to score campaign points,\" she added, saying he had attacked Bain's outsourcing rather than China itself.</p> <p>It's not only Chinese viewers who react uncomfortably to angry rhetoric.<br>\"Such talk does damage,\" <a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/editorials/2012/10/17/best-way-to-deal-with-china-is-to-heal-ourselves.html\">wrote John Frisbie</a>, president of the U.S.-China Business Council. </p> <p>\"It undermines support for a smarter approach to America's most important economic relationship.\"</p> <p>He noted China was a $250bn market for American companies and the third largest buyer of US exports after Canada and Mexico.</p> <p>And as Obama points out, the renminbi has risen, albeit not as far as the US would like \u2013 by 11% since 2008 and almost 30% since 2005.</p> <p>Few in China take campaign statements at face value. Even Romney supporters question whether he would actually label China a manipulator; others point out that applying the label requires no further concrete action.<br>\"Despite his aggressive rhetoric, a President Romney might actually be better for China,\" wrote Shen Dingli <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/10/17/why_china_wants_romney_to_win\">of the Centre for American Studies at Fudan University</a>. </p> <p>\"Traditionally, Republicans have favored free trade, free enterprise, and less regulation ...[and] shared concern over the economic risk of curbing climate change.\"</p> <p>Others say officials would rather deal with the president they know.</p> <p>\"I do not think that these attacks will result in any change in policy no matter who wins. US policy will respond to changes in China,\" argued Dreyer.</p> <p>The Xinhua commentary observed: \"It is an embarrassing truth that past US presidents have often toned down their tough talk on China after taking office, showing that they know the results of their tough talk going into effect would be disastrous.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 25 October because it said June Teufel Dreyer was an expert on Chinese politics at Miami University.

  "<p><strong>In January, </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/25/angela-merkel-greece-financial-meltdown?intcmp=239\" title=\"\"><strong>in an interview with our newspapers</strong></a><strong> Angela Merkel said that the European Union reminded her of an orchestra which has been playing some rather modern music as of late. What are your impressions?</strong></p> <p>Rados\u0142aw Sikorski: The European orchestra might not be hitting all the right notes each and every time, but I prefer this tune to a brawl. When I think of the EU, I think of peace and stability. The Nobel committee reminded us of the foundations and greatest benefits stemming from the EU. Today we are negotiating financial terms, but we must remember that without the EU we would not have achieved Franco-German reconciliation. The EU also helped bring about final Polish-German reconciliation.</p> <p><strong>There is another EU analogy making the rounds in Europe \u2013 that of a barely moving car with rickety parts that may fall off at any moment.</strong></p> <p>The EU lacked discipline. We reached the limits of the soft supervision method with regard to adopted solutions. The stability and growth pact [which imposes budget discipline on eurozone countries] provided for penalties on those who violated it. But nobody actually implemented the clauses, which stipulated fine payments upon infringements. That is why we adopted the \"six-pack\" [a set of directives and regulations aimed at strengthening eurozone financial supervision, adopted during last year's Polish EU presidency] and are adopting the fiscal treaty, because we notice the problems this lack of integrity leads to.</p> <p>The EU must be more efficient in its foreign policy. We announce strategies, but then some countries choose to go solo and reach out to some partners on their own. But wherever we join forces, all of us benefit. Just look at trade \u2013 a field where we pooled sovereignty \u2013 and competition, and the single market with its strong competences for the European commission.</p> <p><strong>EU citizens are losing faith in a united Europe. Most Germans think they would be better off without the EU.</strong></p> <p>The media are partly to blame \u2013 they are becoming more and more brash, and less and less willing to explain complex processes. Politicians also bear some of the blame. They act responsibly in Brussels and are able to take truly European decisions keeping in mind the common good, but as soon as they come home, they talk with their constituents purely in terms of national interests.</p> <p><strong>Why are politicians from so many countries so keen on throwing around Eurosceptic rhetoric?</strong></p> <p>Because it's catchy, just like national stereotypes. If we don't explain to people the benefits stemming from European policies, they will continue to think in the category of their own back yard. Speaking last year at the German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin, I called for the creation of pan-European programmes to build political awareness.</p> <p>We must broaden the meaning of the term \"solidarity\". Westerners see it only as handing out money to the poor. I prefer to say that everyone profits from solidarity: the EU as a whole, all of its member states \u2013 both rich and poor; the fact that we represent common interests on many issues. We must convince citizens of this great truth.</p> <p><strong>The Future of Europe Group recently finished its work. It comprised the chiefs of diplomacy of Poland, Germany, France, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain \u2013 all looking for ways to strengthen Europe and prevent future crises. One of the group's suggestions was to give EU institutions more power and more democratic legitimacy. But it doesn't seem as if Europeans want to have a say in EU policymaking. For years, the turnout in Euro-elections has been dire.</strong></p> <p>The situation is paradoxical. 20 years ago, when the parliament had nothing to say, people went out to vote. Today, when it plays a key role in adopting the budget, people vote less. Interest in the elections would be greater if they were more personalised. If pan-European voting lists were introduced. If an EU president were elected via universal suffrage. And if the parliament had a greater say in the make-up of the European commission.</p> <p><strong>Maybe the problem is not with democracy and election mechanisms, but with the fact that for many people Brussels is too far.</strong></p> <p>If you go to Texas, people will also tell you that Washington is far away, that DC doesn't listen to them and that, on the whole, it is just downright bad. You have to live with it.</p> <p><strong>We were not talking about geographical distance, but about the EU bureaucracy and the many legends linked to it.</strong></p> <p>The bureaucracy in Brussels numbers 32,000 public servants. For a bureaucracy serving an entire continent, this is not a figure I find shocking. Greece has 760,000 officials on the payroll, Spain has 3 million. In the UK, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs alone employs 82,000 people.</p> <p><strong>The Czech president, V\u00e1clav Klaus, said that there is no democracy without the 'demos', the people, the nation. There is no such thing as a European nation. There is the Polish nation, the German one, the French and Czech ones...</strong></p> <p>President Klaus and other Eurosceptics are on point with their diagnosis: there is no European demos as yet. But they are wrong in thinking that the situation will remain static. I recall the words of the Italian politician Massimo D'Azeglio after the Italian unification of 1861: \"We have made Italy, now we must make Italians.\"</p> <p>Some nation-states were also created as political constructs. And obviously the point is not to uproot anyone from their nationality or impose anything on them. But you have to realise that as Poles, Germans, Spaniards, or Englishmen we also share a joint European interest in many issues. And if this additional level of identification is to be democratic, it must be debated. For the debate to be creative, every citizen of the union should have a basic knowledge of its mechanisms and actions.</p> <p><strong>There is no European debate, either. All the talking takes place at the national level.</strong></p> <p>That depends on the field. When it comes to economy and finance, the Financial Times is a European newspaper. We have the Euronews channel \u2013 I very much regret that it doesn't have a Polish edition. As regards technical or European issues, we all read the <a href=\"http://euobserver.com/\" title=\"\">EUObserver</a> website. We have European political parties. They should have increased visibility, hence the Future of Europe Group's suggestion to introduce pan-European lists.</p> <p><strong>Do you see Europe's future as a second United States?</strong></p> <p>The European Union will remain a sui generis structure. I won't use the term \"federalism\", because many people associate it with an irreversible handover of sovereignty to the EU level \u2013 a scenario almost no one wants. I prefer to talk about an irreversible political union, based on conditions which will be subject to negotiations.</p> <p><strong>The Future Group suggests directly electing the commission president. But countries are unwilling to give up their influence with regard to this post. Until now, the head of the EC was appointed by way of backroom dealings.</strong></p> <p>This method lacks transparency. If Europeans want real leaders, they need a way of electing them that will make it possible to choose from among truly distinguished figures. If we continue to cherish the UN method, where everyone has to agree, we will end up getting UN-style leaders.</p> <p><strong>And another one of the group's proposals: the EC president should be free to appoint his or her cabinet. Member states would lose influence when it comes to selecting commissioners.</strong></p> <p>Member states would retain the right to nominate their commissioners. But we recommend that the president appoint commissioners nominated by the member states according to their experience and competence. \"Junior\" and \"senior\" commissioners should also co-operate in the framework of thematic groups.</p> <p><strong>You also want the EU council to take decisions by a majority instead of a unanimous vote.</strong></p> <p>We have already agreed that this will be the case in a range of areas, but we fail to apply this method. Our problem is precisely that many decisions under the Lisbon treaty have not entered into force. Pursuant to the treaty, last year was meant to see the beginning of enhanced defence co-operation \u2013 the next pillar of European integration. Somehow nobody is protesting that this didn't happen. Ignoring the treaties leads to problems like the ones currently affecting the euro.</p> <p><strong>The Future Group focused a lot on the common currency. Poland, meanwhile, is not yet part of the eurozone. And no one knows when it will adopt the euro.</strong></p> <p>Even at a time of crisis, our government is doing everything possible to join the eurozone. We will ratify the fiscal compact by the end of the year. We are consistently implementing the expenditure rule, which means that we will have fulfilled the economic criteria by the end of this parliamentary term. The next government will be able to rationally assess whether the eurozone has put its house in order, thereby enabling Poland to adopt the euro safely and to the benefit of both sides.</p> <p><strong>The battle for the EU budget is about to begin. The British have already stated that it must be slashed. What type of solidarity and common interests are we even talking about?</strong></p> <p>Poland is one of the biggest payers contributing to the British rebate [negotiated by Margaret Thatcher to exclude the United Kingdom from part of the EU contribution; the rebate is covered by the other member states]. But Great Britain says that it will veto the commission's proposals regarding the new budget, even though they have already been cut. A generous budget and cohesion funds used to finance infrastructure projects are the only effective way of stimulating economic growth. It's a win-win situation, because highways and internet connections financed from EU funds are being built by companies from different member states.</p> <p><strong>What if Britain decides the knives are out over the budget?</strong></p> <p>Then the European orchestra will start to rap. I recently went to Oxford, where I tried to show the British just how much they are benefiting from the EU. Those \u00a3150 a statistical Briton pays towards the EU is a bargain relative to all the benefits. Poland supports the budget proposal put forward by the commission. We are not alone. Most EU countries share our position.</p> <p><strong>One year ago in Berlin, you said that you fear German inaction more than you fear German domination. But fear of Germany's power and diktats is not abating.</strong></p> <p>I think it boils down to the fact that Germany doesn't want to hand over its credit card. Many people would accept German power if it were unconditionally followed by money. Of course, there is a limit to the pressure that may be put on countries which delayed their necessary reforms for decades on end. Berlin's insistence on thrift and reform is understandable, but if it goes over the top, it will stifle economic growth, which will in turn make it impossible for these countries to pay off their debts. This is where some very serious mistakes have been made. For example, the initial aid package for Greece demanded deep spending cuts in exchange for high-interest loans. Meanwhile, the loans should have been preferential. Repairing these mistakes will cost Europe dearly.</p> <p><strong>I failed to find a single word on enlargement in the Future Group report.</strong></p> <p>European enlargement is taking place as we speak. We are about to welcome Croatia. Serbia has gained candidate status. Chancellor Merkel recently visited Moldova, praising the country's pro-European path. We invite Georgia to bolster its democracy; the recent elections were indeed a positive step. We are talking with the Ukrainians, trying to convince them to create conditions for the ratification of the EU association agreement.</p> <p>There is no doubt that Poland is in favour of enlargement. Indeed, in its justification in giving out the award to the EU, the Nobel prize committee stated that it was through enlargement that the EU had broadened the area of peace in Europe. The verdict was given by the Norwegians, who are not part of the EU, so there must be some truth to this claim.</p>",
  "<p>At the eastern tip of the Israeli settlement of Ariel, cranes and earth-movers are at work on the college campus, which stretches across a hill overlooking the villages and valleys of the West Bank. Eleven miles from the internationally recognised Green Line separating Israel from the Palestinian Territories, construction is under way of buildings to accommodate a projected growth from 13,000 to 20,000 students over the next 10 years.</p> <p>In September, the college passed a significant milestone when the Israeli cabinet voted to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/09/israel-west-bank-ariel-university-upgrade-row\" title=\"\">upgrade the college to a university</a> as a matter of \"national importance\". Backing the move, prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu told the cabinet that Ariel was \"an inseparable part of Israel\" and would remain so in the future.</p> <p>The decision, concerning a settlement which is illegal under international law and whose future is a key determinant of a viable Palestinian state and the peaceful resolution of a decades-old conflict, was not universally acclaimed. Urging Israel to reconsider, British foreign secretary William Hague said it would \"deepen the presence of the settlements in the Palestinian territories and will create another obstacle to peace\".</p> <p>Deeper inside the West Bank, a few miles east of Ariel, construction workers are also busy. Earlier this year, Israel approved <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/west-bank-settlement-of-shiloh-gets-initial-approval-for-600-new-homes-1.414215\" title=\"\">plans for 600 homes</a> in the settlement of Shiloh and its outpost, Shvut Rachel. \"This community has doubled in size in 20 years, and there is no question that there will be further growth. The demand for homes is much greater than supply,\" said Shiloh's former mayor, David Rubin.</p> <p>Further south, Israel a year ago announced plans for a settlement across the Green Line close to Jerusalem. The 2,600 homes of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/16/israel-settlement-isolate-arab-jerusalem\" title=\"\">Givat Hamatos</a>, plus expansion of neighbouring Gilo and Har Homa, will increase the separation of Palestinian areas of the city from the West Bank, reducing the likelihood of East Jerusalem becoming the capital of a future Palestinian state.</p> <p>These three places illustrate a pattern of settlement growth that mocks Barack Obama's demand, issued early in his presidency, that Israel should halt expansion as an impediment to peace.</p> <p>Entrenchment of \"facts on the ground\" has led a growing number of people, on both sides of the conflict, to declare that creating a Palestinian state alongside an Israeli state to resolve the conflict is now impossible. The \"two-state solution\", they say, is dead.</p> <p>In June 2009, less than six months into his presidency, <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1902738,00.html\" title=\"\">Obama addressed the Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a> in his keynote speech on the Middle East in Cairo. Restating US commitment to a two-state model, he said the Palestinians must abandon violence, and develop their capacity to govern. By most reckoning, the Ramallah leadership has ticked both boxes.</p> <p>On the Israeli side, Obama said the US did not accept the legitimacy of Jewish settlements. \"It is time for these settlements to stop,\" he said bluntly.</p> <p>There followed protracted negotiations between the US and Israeli governments which resulted, in November 2009, in Netanyahu reluctantly acceding to a temporary construction freeze in West Bank settlements. East Jerusalem was exempt, with the completion of any buildings whose foundations were already laid. In anticipation of the moratorium, the number of construction starts rose significantly in the run-up to November.</p> <p>Critics denounced the freeze as a farce, but the settlers were incensed and relations between Netanyahu and Obama nosedived. Relations between the two allies were \"in the state of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/27/israel-us-relations-tectonic-rift\" title=\"\">a tectonic rift </a>in which continents are drifting apart,\" Michael Oren, Israel's ambassador to the US, memorably said in mid-2010. The freeze ended in September 2010, despite US efforts to secure an extension. Direct talks between Israel and the Palestinians swiftly broke down as settlement construction resumed, since when the \"peace process\" has been in a catatonic state.</p> <p>Obama was heavily criticised for his early focus on settlements. But, according to one observer, \"the problem was not Obama's identification of the settlement issue as a critical obstacle to the resumption of talks and, beyond that, to the two-state model itself \u2013 it was his failure to stick with it in the face of Netanyahu's intransigence\".</p> <p>In the past two years, US officials have issued routine condemnation of settlement expansion plans but real pressure from Washington has eased. In June, Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics reported that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/26/jewish-population-west-bank-up\" title=\"\">the number of Jewish settlers in the West Bank</a> had risen by 15,000 over the previous 12 months, to a record 350,000. Most of the growth was in small hardline settlements deep inside the West Bank. An additional 200,000 Jews live in settlements in East Jerusalem. In the New York Times, s ettlers' leader Dani Dayon <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/26/opinion/israels-settlers-are-here-to-stay.html\" title=\"\"> pronounced the Jewish presence across the Green Line \"an irreversible fact\"</a>. Predicting the numbers in Jewish colonies in the West Bank would top 400,000 by 2014, he wrote: \"Trying to stop settlement expansion is futile.\" The international community should relinquish its \"vain attempts to attain the unattainable two-state solution\".</p> <p>He said: \"Our presence here has now passed a point of non-return. It's irrevocable, a fait accompli.\" The status quo, while not ideal, was \"immeasurably better than any feasible alternative\".</p> <p>In the face of the \"facts on the ground\", others are proposing alternative courses of action. Some on the Israeli right have called for annexation of the West Bank. The Palestinian population can either accept living under Israeli rule with limited rights or leave, they say. Critics say this would be akin to apartheid and make Israel a pariah state.</p> <p>Others have called for a more modest, but unilateral, annexation of the 9.4% of the West Bank which will lie between the Green Line and Israel's separation barrier when it is complete. Defence minister Ehud Barak recently proposed that settlers outside the three main blocs \u2013 Ma'ale Adumim, Gush Etzion and Ariel \u2013 should be evacuated or choose to live under Palestinian rule. The barrier would become what its critics have always charged \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=5880\" title=\"\">Israel's new border</a>. \"It would be best to reach agreement with the Palestinians but, barring that, practical steps must be taken to begin the separation,\" he said in a newspaper interview.</p> <p><a href=\"http://bluewhitefuture.org/\" title=\"\">Blue White Future</a>, a relatively new organisation, also argues for \"constructive unilateralism\", by which it means Israel withdrawing to the security barrier, with voluntary evacuation and compensation for those in settlements beyond. \"Once Israel announces it has no sovereignty claims east of the fence, most [settlers] will move westwards,\" said Orni Petruschka, co-chairman.</p> <p>Some have even suggested the \"cantonisation\" of the West Bank. The Palestinian Authority would be given autonomy in five cantons around the main West Bank cities of Ramallah, Jenin, Nablus, Bethlehem and Hebron, with Israeli sovereignty over the rest of the territory.</p> <p>There are also growing Palestinian voices declaring the end of the two-state model. \"The two-state solution died long ago, with Israel's refusal to confront the settlement movement,\" said Palestinian analyst Diana Butto. \"Unless this colonial project is addressed completely, there cannot be two states, only apartheid.\" The battle now, she said, was for universal rights within the one state that is in de facto existence.</p> <p>Among those still fighting for a two-state model are European diplomats in Jerusalem who have identified a handful of West Bank and East Jerusalem settlements as \"game changers\". Significant growth in these places would signal crossing a red line, they say. \"There's a year, or 18 months maximum, before it's over,\" said one.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.molad.org/\" title=\"\">Molad</a>, a young leftist Israeli thinktank, says it is fighting an \"irreversibility thesis\". According to director Avner Inbar, \"talk of the end of the two-state solution is irresponsible. The two-state solution is not only the best framework, it's the only one that will work. None of the advocates of one state talk of the likely consequences. It would result in dramatic and possibly catastrophic violence.\"</p> <p>Barring the unexpected, the most likely course is continuation of the status quo \u2013 Netanyahu's preferred option and so, it seems, Republican candidate Mitt Romney's, judging by a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/18/mitt-romney-israel-palestinian-solution\" title=\"\">recently leaked video</a>. But as many analysts and diplomats point out, the \"status quo\" in practice means the entrenchment and growth of settlements.</p> <p>A reinvigorated second-term Obama presidency could change that. In an interview with ABC in July, the president was asked if there was anything he believed he had failed at, that \"has you desperate to get that second term to atone for?\" There were \"a bunch of things that we didn't get done that I think were important,\" replied Obama. On foreign policy, he said, \"I have not been able to move the peace process forwards in the Middle East in the way I wanted\".</p> <p>Faith, as well as time, has been lost. \"Obama has learned this is not an issue that will win him any votes. I am not someone who believes a second-term president will act any differently that he did in his first term,\" said Butto.</p> <p>According to Dayon, \"Obama has learned the limitation of his powers to make change here. President Obama of 2012 will not be the same as President Obama of 2008 because he now realises he cannot deliver.\"</p> <p>Back in Ariel, students are hurrying between classes at the start of term. At the Moskowitz School of Communications, named after the US bingo magnate Irving Moskowitz, who has spent millions of dollars funding the settlement enterprise in the West Bank, 24-year-old Adi said she was thrilled at the institution's new university classification. \"It will give graduates better status and better job prospects. Yes, of course, we are situated in the middle of a conflict, but a city like Ariel is very valuable to Israel. We cannot give it up.\"</p> <p>Down the road in Shiloh, David Rubin dismissed the idea of evacuating any settlements. \"We're supposed to hand over our heartland? This is my country, where my roots are, where my history is, where my destiny is, where the Jewish people were born, exiled from and returned to. This community will never be destroyed. There will never be a deal with the Palestinians.\"</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama and Mitt Romney will this week throw themselves into frantic, almost non-stop tours of the battlefield states that will help decide what is shaping up to be one of the most closely contested elections in recent US history.</p> <p>In a sign of the intensity of the campaign in the final fortnight, after Monday's third and final presidential debate, Obama is to travel to six swing states and his hometown, Chicago, in 48 hours. The president, who normally returns to Washington overnight, is to sleep aboard Air Force One to save time for campaigning and will also make election calls while the plane is in the air.</p> <p>A new Wall Street Journal/NBC poll shows that after trailing Obama all year, Romney is now tied with him on 47% of the likely vote. The last WSJ/NBC poll, taken before the first presidential debate in which Romney dominated the president, had Obama ahead by 49% to 46%.</p> <p>One of Obama's chief advisers, David Axelrod, expressed scepticism about the polls when he appeared on NBC on Sunday, pointing to huge variations in findings.</p> <p>\"I do think that this is going to be a very close race, and we've said that consistently,\" he said. \"We feel good about where we are. We feel we're even or ahead in these battleground states.\"</p> <p>An election that had seemed listless is entering its last phase with re-energised Republicans finally believing that their candidate might make it to the White House and Democrats panicking at the thought that Obama might be slung out of office after a single term.</p> <p>Tens of thousands of volunteers, many of whom had been disinterested for much of the year, turned up at campaign offices over the weekend, conscious at last of what is at stake on 6 November.</p> <p>The two candidates go into Monday's debate in Boca Raton, Florida, with Romney having won with a knock-out in the first in Denver and Obama winning on points in the second in Hempstead, New York. The 90-minute Boca Raton debate will be devoted to foreign affairs.</p> <p>As president, with daily access to briefings on foreign affairs and security, Obama goes into the final debate as favourite, not least because it gives him another chance to remind voters that Osama bin Laden was killed on his watch.</p> <p>But Romney, after two botched attempts to force Obama onto the defensive over Libya, will try again over the assault on the US consulate in Benghazi that left the ambassador and three other Americans dead.</p> <p>The US response to the stand-off with Iran over its nuclear programme is almost certain to be debated. The New York Times reported on Sunday that the Obama administration had achieved a diplomatic breakthrough with an agreement in principle to one-to-one talks with Tehran after the election. The Iranian government has long argued for one-to-one negotiations rather than the international coalition of the US, Britain, France, Russia, China and Germany.</p> <p>The White House denied there had been an agreement, but said it was open in principle to such negotations.</p> <p>In a sign of how engaged voters have become, an estimated 65.5 million people watched the second debate, one in which the figures normally drop off substantially. It was only marginally down on the first one, which was watched by 67 million people, and well up on 2008 viewing figures. Even amid the excitement then at the prospect of the first African-American president, the three debates averaged audiences of around 57 million.</p> <p>Obama spent the weekend in debate rehearsal at Camp David, while Romney held his last fundraising event at a donor's home in Palm Beach, Florida, freeing himself for debate preparation at a hotel in Boca Raton and the campaign sprints that will follow.</p> <p>With the debate over, Obama will on Wednesday embark on a two-day campaign blitz of six swing states: Iowa, Colorado, Florida, Nevada, Virginia and Ohio. He will also drop into his hometown Chicago to cast his ballot early.</p> <p>\"As the president crisscrosses the nation, he will spend time on Air Force One calling undecided voters, rallying national team leaders and volunteers and continuously engaging with Americans,\" his campaign said in a statement.</p> <p>Romney will head for two days of campaigning in Nevada, Colorado and Ohio on Tuesday.</p> <p>The Republican campaign has been underway since at least the Ames straw poll in Iowa in summer last year, a traditional early test for candidates seeking the party's nomination. The Republican nomination race produced lots of headlines, from allegations of sexual harassment by Herman Cain to Newt Gingrich's proposals for a colony on the moon, but the election failed to capture the public imagination in the same way as 2008.</p> <p>But Romney's victory in the Denver debate and the subsequent tightening in the polls has changed all that.</p> <p>Both campaigns having raised close to $1bn (\u00a3625m), meaning that the candidates go into the final fortnight with funds to saturate ad markets in every swing state. It is the costliest election in US history.</p> <p>An analysis by the Politico website suggested the Obama campaign had raised $969m in funding and the Romney campaign $919m. Both will be asking for more donations over the final two weeks.</p> <p>Filings by the Republicans over the weekend to the federal election commission, as required by law, showed Romney and the Republican party ending September with $183m in hand, compared with $149m for Obama and the Democrats. The Obama campaign spent heavily over the summer in a pre-emptive strike while Romney has been hoarding cash for a final ad blitz.</p> <p>As alarming for Democrats as the WSJ/NBC poll is one by Public Policy Polling in Ohio, the bastion on which Obama rests his hopes if the east coast swing states - Florida, North Carolina, Virginia and New Hampshire - fall to Romney. PPP has Obama on 49% and Romney on 48% in what is a predominantly working-class state in America's industrial heartland.</p>",
  "<p>Syria, more than anywhere else, is sorely testing Barack Obama's hands-off policy in the Middle East. So grave is the crisis in the Levant that it will go close to defining the success of the US president's second term \u2013 or Mitt Romney's first.</p> <p>If Obama was to be judged now on how he has dealt with the ever-worsening Syrian civil war, history would likely be harsh. The US has remained largely on the sidelines of the most violent episode of the Arab spring, shaping its response through the regional policy it laid down before the first stirrings of uprising in Tunisia.</p> <p>Soon after replacing George W Bush, Obama rubber-stamped the Republican president's policy shift, which pledged to recast the way the US dealt with the entrenched Arab world order. From 2006, Bush had said, the 50-year approach of favouring stability over democracy was to be turned on its head. Democracy was to be paramount. Stability, it was suggested, was to play second fiddle.</p> <p>Bush's resolve was barely put to the test, apart from some faltering steps towards nation-building in Iraq. Not so Obama. Almost everything about the first few heady months of the Arab spring spoke directly to the values Obama had first championed in his landmark 2009 address to the Arab world in Cairo: tyranny needed to defeated by self-determination, state repression trumped by accountability, violence checked by the rule of law.</p> <p>After rumbling through north Africa, the same themes soon took root in Syria, where they were confronted with a withering rearguard from the regime and its backers \u2013 primarily Iran and Hezbollah, as well as an old enemy, Russia. The US knew from the outset that this was to be no romp through the desert like Libya. After readily agreeing to send jets and missiles to bomb Gaddafi, Obama's administration has steadfastly refused to do the same to Bashar al-Assad.</p> <p>A soaring death count, the growing threat of regional spillover, expectations from Sunni allies that Washington take the lead in stemming the chaos, and rising belligerence from Tel Aviv to Tehran have done nothing to shift Obama. And nor will they as he fights the last three weeks of a presidential campaign fought largely on domestic issues and his belief that the US should no longer take a stake in all the world's core problems.</p> <p>A president who won office partly on getting out of giant misadventures in the Middle East clearly doesn't want to campaign on the merits of getting the US involved in another one.</p> <p>The US military, its institutions \u2013 and the presidency \u2013 have learned some key lessons from Iraq, especially the perils of taking a power stake in a sectarian state. Almost 10 years on from the second Iraq war, there is nothing to suggest that intervening in Syria would be any easier. Far from it.</p> <p>The vacuum that would follow the fall of Damascus would become a high-stakes contest for myriad players. Two of them, Hezbollah and Iran, have an enormous amount to lose if Assad is ousted. Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states have a lot to lose if he stays.</p> <p>Add to that the slowly growing presence of global jihadists, who for now remain a minority voice among an insurrection that started as a nationalistic push but is losing some ground to a sectarian agenda.</p> <p>Arming the rebel groups opposed to Assad remains fraught. Attempts by the US and Turkey to organise the many groups under a functional command haven't worked. Without that, a re-elected Obama is unlikely to change his first-term opposition to sending the heavy weapons that rebel fighters need to mount a serious threat to what remains of the regime's military.</p> <p>Obama spent much of his first term recalibrating what he deemed to be his national security interests. Filtered through the realpolitik of getting re-elected, Syria has remained in the too-hard tray with neither him or his inner court conceding that what is happening as the country crumbles directly affects the US.</p> <p>That position cannot last. Syria is perilously close to the abyss and its likely descent further will affect all corners of the region and far beyond. From the inauguration on, Syria will be central to the stage, along with its key backer, Iran. What to do about it will prove a defining chapter for US interests.</p>",

  "<p>Separatist tensions within the European Union looked set to grow with a surge of support for pro-independence parties at regional elections held on Sunday in Spain's northern Basque country.</p> <p>A separatist coalition, EH Bildu, became the region's second biggest political group, taking a quarter of the vote as it reaped a peace dividend following armed separatist group Eta's decision to end four decades of terrorism last year.</p> <p>The coalition brings together peaceful separatists with former members of Eta's political wing who are no longer banned from parliamentary politics. It won 21 of the 75 seats in the regional parliament.</p> <p>The moderate Basque Nationalist party (PNV), which backs a gradual march towards an as yet undefined form of independence, lost votes to EH Bildu but was the overall winner with a third of the votes and 27 seats.</p> <p>PNV looked set to form a minority government, possibly supported by EH Bildu, though party leader I\u00f1igo Urkullu has refused to say exactly how he plans to govern. The two parties jointly won almost two-thirds of the seats, bringing an end to three years of socialist government under outgoing Basque prime minister Patxi L\u00f3pez.</p> <p>Although Urkullu has pledged to make the economy his first priority, he was widely expected to follow the example of Catalan regional president Artur Mas and call some kind of referendum on independence over the coming four years.</p> <p>But it remained unclear whether his party would ask for full independence, a new statute of autonomy giving it greater self-government or simply demand that Spain explicitly allow it a right to self-determination in the future.</p> <p>During the campaign Urkullu has both described his party as being \"in favour of 21st century-style independence\" and wanting a new \"bilateral\" relationship with Spain. Analysts say that reflects a party split between separatists and those seeking greater autonomy within Spain.</p> <p>\"The Spanish state has become a brake on the development of the Basque country,\" the PNV states in its manifesto.</p> <p>Urkullu said that the absence of Eta meant these were the first properly free elections for decades. \"This country cannot be built through confrontation or exclusion,\" he said.</p> <p>He gave few clues, however, about his plans beyond saying that the Basque country must remain part of the EU.</p> <p>The Basque election result will add to the problems of Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy, whose conservative People's party (PP) government has already vowed to block any independence referendums called by regional governments.</p> <p>The wealthy and populous north-eastern Spanish region of Catalonia goes to the polls next month as support for independence there rises above 50% in opinion polls. Regional Catalan prime minister Artur Mas, whose nationalist Convergence and Union (CiU) coalition looks set to increase its seats in the regional parliament, has pledged to call a referendum despite Rajoy's threat to declare it illegal.</p> <p>Catalan and Basque separatists are watching events in Scotland, hoping that a yes vote at an independence referendum there in 2014 would force the EU to come up with a formula allowing for member states to split up.</p> <p>In separate elections held in Galicia in the north-west of Spain, Rajoy's People's party hung on to the regional government, despite the recession and 25% unemployment throughout the country.</p>"
