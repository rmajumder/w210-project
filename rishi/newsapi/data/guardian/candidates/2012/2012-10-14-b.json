  "<p>In his marvellous book <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781862079601\" title=\"\">Imperium, Ryszard Kapuscinski</a> describes a visit to Tbilisi. It's 1990 and Georgians \u2013 like other subject peoples in the crumbling Soviet Union \u2013 are agitating for independence. On Rustaveli Avenue, women are staging sitins. As well as chronicling political turmoil, Kapuscinski notes Tbilisi's enchanting old town: \"A neighbourhood of latticework pastel houses, verandas, balconies and gardens ... Even today [it] has retained in places a touch of its former charm.\"</p> <p>When I arrive in Georgia two decades later, the small post-Soviet nation is going through another historical moment. In an election this month, a coalition headed by the Georgian billionaire <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/01/bidzina-ivanishvili-profile-georgia\" title=\"\">Bidzina Ivanishvili</a> defeats the ruling party of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/01/georgia-election-mikheil-saakashvili\" title=\"\">Mikheil Saakashvili</a>, the country's Atlanticist president. It is an unprecedented result: the first time that power in Georgia has changed hands through democracy rather than by revolution or foreign invaders.</p> <p>But in old Tbilisi a tragedy is underway. The authorities are rapidly destroying the 19th-century buildings that beguiled Kapuscinski and lend the capital its low-lying wooden charm. The old town is home to a jumble of architectural styles: Russian classical and art nouveau. (None of the buildings here is older than 1795 when the Persians burned Tbilisi to the ground.) Its most distinctive features are wooden balconies \u2013 elaborate, rickety, and protruding above narrow cobbled streets, ornate doorways, pomegranates and fig trees.</p> <p>According to Peter Nasmyth, a British writer and publisher who lives in Tbilisi for much of the year, <a href=\"http://www.tbilisiheritagegroup.co.uk/\" title=\"\">about a third of the old town has gone</a>. The pace of destruction has increased since 2007. \"It's been ripped down, replaced by a Disney-version of itself,\" he laments, as we embark on a tour of the old town. He adds: \"This is the Asian part of Tbilisi. We are losing all these sagging wooden balconies. They are knocking them down and building them in a completely different style. It's heartbreaking.\"</p> <p>In May, the authorities began tearing apart one of Tbilisi's most iconic buildings \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.tbilisiheritagegroup.co.uk/\" title=\"\">\"Lermontov House\" in Gudiashvili Square</a>. The square is an enclave of dilapidated empire-style mansions and shady acacia trees; I eat a piece of cheesecake on election night in its retro Pur Pur cafe. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Lermontov\" title=\"\">Russian novelist</a> is believed to have stayed in the house in the 1820s; it features in his masterpiece A Hero of Our Time. A short walk away is Freedom Square. It is here Ivanishvili supporters celebrate their victory, partying on a roundabout that once boasted a statue of Lenin.</p> <p>When I arrive I find the house an empty shell. A construction company has ripped off its exquisite multi-sided balcony. Parts of the roof and the staircase banisters have disappeared; no one seems to know what happened to them; in the courtyard, a young man waves the flag of Ivanishvili's <a href=\"http://www.georgiandream.ge/eng,georgian-dream-coalition\" title=\"\">\"Georgian Dream\" party</a>. Over the summer a group of Georgian conservationists stood outside Lermontov's mansion. They blew whistles and held placards saying: \"If you destroy this building you destroy us.\" To no avail.</p> <p>Nearby in Puri, or Bread Square, I discover a digger. The square's east side has been flattened; the replacement building will be two storeys higher. \"This used to be one of the nicest little squares in Tbilisi. The frontage was lovely. One of Europe's most interesting old towns is being massacred,\" Nasmyth says. Typically, he adds, developers bulldoze a property then replace it with a concrete sham replica, facaded with original bricks. The owners sell up and move out, leaving old Tbilisi increasingly soulless.</p> <p>Saakashvili \u2013 Georgia's architect-in-chief \u2013 has his own vision of how Tbilisi should look. His idiom is glass and steel; modernist buildings sprout everywhere. The president lives in a neoclassical palace with a transparent egg-shaped dome; just below it is a new concert hall, like two giant slinkies. Tbilisi also has a mushroom-shaped justice building, a modernist interior ministry and a \"peace bridge\". <a href=\"http://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/pawel-wargan/tbilisi-moscow-language-of-architecture\" title=\"\">Critics complain the president has adopted the same chilly visual language as Georgia's former Soviet oppressors.</a></p> <p>Saakashvili, meanwhile, has begun rebuilding the ruined 11th-century Bagrati cathedral in western Georgia, blown up by the Turks. \"It's similar to reconstructing Tintern Abbey with brand new walls, a new dome and glass elevator on the side,\" Nasmymth tells me. And a mock Bavarian-style village has been wrapped around Georgia's largest Sveti Tschoveli church, situated in the old capital of Mtskheta, near Tbilisi. Unesco is alarmed. It <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_Heritage_in_Danger\" title=\"\">has put both sites on its endangered list.</a></p> <p>Ivanishvili, meanwhile, lives in a James Bond-baddy-style mansion set in the hills above Tbilisi. Aides nickname it the \"glassle\". Designed by the futurist Japanese architect <a href=\"http://www.takamatsu.co.jp/\" title=\"\">Shin Takamatsu</a>, it boasts tubular columns and a giant internal sphere \u2013 suspended as if in mid-air. (The sphere is actually a cafe that seats 150 people.) The billionaire's personal residence is next door and looks like an inverted alien spaceship about to blast off.</p> <p>On the eve of the election Ivanishvili shows me around: works by Henry Moore and other sculptors dot his residence; there is a panoramic view of Tbilisi, twinkling in the valley below; behind us is Tbilisi's botanical garden. Standing next to a softly gurgling fountain Ivanishvil talks fondly of his animals; he has a zoo with penguins, lemurs and a zebra. \"Would you like to take a deer home?\" he asks me. Two days later Ivanishvili \u2013 having won a majority \u2013 tears into Saakashvili for wrecking Georgia's architecture. Saakashvili's aides are unimpressed. \"Whenever we restore anything we look in the archives first,\" one, Batu Kutelia, tells me. He adds: \"Have you seen Ivanishvili's palace?\"</p>",
  "<p>A half-century ago this month, on October 22 1962, President John F Kennedy <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W50RNAbmy3M\">went on television to reveal</a> the presence of Soviet missiles on Cuba and his decision to impose a blockade on the island to stop more Soviet deliveries getting through. </p> <p>The more we find out about this perilous face-off, the closer it appears we were to a nuclear catastrophe. <a href=\"http://bos.sagepub.com/content/early/2012/10/10/0096340212464364.full.pdf+html\">New research</a> by Robert Norris and Hans Kristensen for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, found that there were 158 Soviet nuclear warheads of five types already in Cuba by the time the military blockade was imposed on October 24. The crisis, they conclude, was \"even more serious and dangerous than previously thought\".</p> <p>The Bulletin has published <a href=\"http://thebulletin.org/web-edition/features/50-years-ago-the-cuban-missile-crisis-and-its-underappreciated-hero\">another article</a> to mark the fiftieth anniversary, lauding the largely unsung role of the UN secretary general at the time, U Thant, in finding a compromise between the US and Soviet Union. </p> <p>Thant's role was better recognised at the time, but has since been buried in American histories of the stand-off. Authors Walter Dorn and Robert Pauk write:</p> <blockquote> <p>Certainly Kennedy's resolve played a role in this conflict, but his appreciation of the need to give his opponent an honourable way out was crucial. He wisely used an internationally prominent and skilled mediator to do so. Thant was the consummate diplomat, humble and self-effacing. Less than a year in office, he had already gained Khrushchev's trust on a visit to the Soviet Union that included a friendly swim with the Soviet leader at his Crimean dacha. Kennedy also trusted Thant and later praised his efforts to end the Cuban Missile Crisis. But Thant did not seek recognition; rather he practised quiet diplomacy and wanted the parties to take the credit.</p> </blockquote> <p>What would U Thant do now? Graham Allison, author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Essence-Decision-Explaining-Missile-Crisis/dp/0321013492\">Essence of Decision</a>, calls the Iran situation<em><a href=\"http://www.vancouversun.com/mobile/news/world-news/years+after+Cuban+missile+crisis+scholars+compromise+brinkmanship/7388200/story.html\"> \"the Cuban missile crisis in slow-motion\"</a></em>.</p> <blockquote> <p>This same process is looming on the current trajectory, inexorably, toward a confrontation at which an American president is going to have to choose between attacking Iran to prevent it becoming a nuclear weapons state or acquiescing and then confronting a nuclear weapons state.</p> </blockquote> <p>The best course, Allison argues, is not to get to that point of confrontation in the first place. Easier said, of course. It would be interesting to perform a comparison between Nikita Kruschev and Ali Khamenei, as an adversary at nuclear chess. One obvious difference is that Iran's Supreme Leader doesn't actually have any real pieces, just stocks of black and white wood, so to speak, which could be turned into pieces.</p> <p>What the Cuban and Iranian crises have in common is that, now as then, it is reasonable to assume that both sides would like to find a way out of the impasse, as the CIA veteran, Paul Pillar, recently <a href=\"http://nationalinterest.org/blog/paul-pillar/the-achievable-deal-iran-7565\">argued in the National Interest</a>. The US and Iran (and it is ultimately about these two nations coming to an agreement) have both signalled at various times that they would be open to a compromise which left Iran able to enrich uranium below 5% purity in return for stricter international controls. Israel, Saudi Arabia and possibly France would have problems with such an outcome, but they would presumably be ready to live with it with suitable US assurances and cajoling.</p> <p>The problem is how to get from here to there. That is the goal of the next <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/11/diplomatic-defusing-iranian-nuclear-crisis\">diplomatic push</a> after the US elections. But there are questions over whether it will take off at all. Would a Mitt Romney victory lead to a long pause in real negotiations while the incoming administration worked out what its real (as opposed to its campaign) position is? And does the aged, ailing, chronically indecisive Khamenei, have what it takes to make such a far-ranging strategic decision?</p> <p>The right answer to both questions is: Who knows? But even if Obama gets a second bite of the cherry after November 6, and it turns out that the Supreme Leader has indeed been waiting all this time to find out who will be in charge in the Oval Office next year before getting into serious negotiations, there is still a lot of diplomacy to be done. </p> <p>The impact of sanctions, undeniable though it is, may not work in favour of a compromise, if the West puts off a deal from a position of strength because it believes it will get a better one if it waits another week or month, while Tehran puts off a deal on the grounds you should never agree a price at your weakest moment. It will take an awful lot of vision all round to land this crisis safely. And, just as in Cuba, a good deal of luck.</p>",
  "<p>For five years everything in Polish football was geared towards hosting Euro 2012. Hopes were high, stadiums were built and there was a giddy expectancy around Franciszek Smuda's team.</p> <p>Then the tournament came \u2013 and went \u2013 with Poland going out in the group stage. Smuda left with his tail between his legs, saying the 1-0 defeat against Czech Republic was the \"end of a great adventure\".</p> <p>And it was. Euro 2012 was Poland's chance to achieve something on the European scene. They had never won a match at a European Championship \u2013 and they still haven't. A chance missed.</p> <p>So morale was low when the 2012-13 season started. To make matters worse, all Polish clubs crashed out of the Champions League and Europa League before the summer holidays were over. All in all it was clear that the new coach, Waldemar Fornalik, needed a good result in his first game in charge to lift spirits. Sadly, he lost 1-0 to Estonia.</p> <p>Since then, Poland have played two World Cup qualifiers in Group H \u2013 drawing 2-2 against Montenegro away and beating Moldova 2-0 at home \u2013 and on Friday they won a friendly 1-0 against South Africa after a debut goal from the substitute Marcin Komorowski.</p> <p>Fornalik made his name in club football and last season he led Ruch Chorzow \u2013 who have one of the smallest budgets in the Ekstraklasa \u2013 to second place. He has freshened up the squad by calling up players such as Pawel Wszolek of Polonia Warsaw and Arkadiusz Piech of Ruch Chorzow.</p> <p>However, it is the more experienced players who seem to be causing Fornalik the most problems. The atmosphere within the squad is said to be poor with stories being leaked to the press about disharmony between the two star players Jakub \"Kuba\" Blaszczykowski and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/may/29/euro-2012-experts-network-poland-profile\" title=\"\">Robert Lewandowski</a>.</p> <p>Blaszczykowski, who is perhaps best known in the UK for the astonishing admission on the eve of Euro 2012 that he watched his father stab his mother to death when he was 10, is the captain of the team whereas Lewandowski, who has been linked with a move to Manchester United, is the main goalscorer.</p> <p>But despite playing for the same club side, they do not appear to be the best of friends. So for Fornalik, the fact that Blaszczykowski will miss the England game with an injured ankle may actually be good news.</p> <p>This may sound preposterous considering Blaszczykowski's form for Dortmund \u2013 including his recent performance at the Etihad Stadium against Manchester City \u2013 but the \"Kuba\" who plays in the yellow and black of Dortmund is a very different person to the one who captains Poland.</p> <p>For Poland he plays with his head down and passes only when surrounded by a wall of opponents. If he played that way for Dortmund he would be dropped by the manager, J\u00fcrgen Klopp. With Poland, though, it is different as Fornalik simply cannot afford to leave out someone of Blaszczykowski's calibre.</p> <p>Kuba's problem seems to be that he believes an advert he did for a supermarket a while ago in which the then coach Smuda said to him: \"Pass the ball, you won't win the game alone\". Kuba replied: \"Yes, I will.\" For the England game, Anderlecht's Marcin Wasilewski will captain the side.</p> <p>The match, on the eve of the 39th anniversary of the goalkeeper Jan Tomaszewski's heroics in a World Cup qualifier at Wembley, is important for Polish football not only in order to qualify for 2014, but for the future of the game and how the outcome may influence the vote for a new Polish FA president on 26 October.</p> <p>Grzegorz Lato will not be in the running after failing to get the 15 votes needed to run for re-election but three men who have the same approach as him will be \u2013 and a win against England would be huge boost for them. Otherwise the path is clear for Zbigniew Boniek, who needs no introduction, or Roman Kosecki (the former Legia, Galatasaray, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Nantes winger who is now a member of parliament).</p> <p>Change at the top may not be a bad thing for the future of Polish football so even if they loseon Tuesday night there may a few smiles among the home team's supporters.</p> <p>But despite all the problems there is a surprisingly optimistic mood in the country ahead of the game against Roy Hodgson's England. The former national coach Antoni Piechniczek who took Poland to third in the 1982 World Cup, was also in charge four years later when they lost 3-0 to England.</p> <p>\"It was the end of an era when we lost 3-0 in Mexico after Gary Lineker's hat-trick. We didn't qualify for another major tournament for 16 years after that,\" he told Przeglad Sportowy.</p> <p>\"I also lost against England in the 1998 World Cup qualifiers [1-2 and 0-2] but this time I'm fairly optimistic. Our potential going forward is high. We've got some problems in defence but the English defenders are inexperienced too.</p> <p>\"I think we will score two against England on Tuesday night and this match will go a long way towards telling whether I was right in backing Fornalik as the new manager.\"</p>",
  "<p>Even, perhaps especially, in a crisis, Europe moves at a glacial pace. Incrementally, forwards and backwards, prevaricating, bickering: so it has been for three years of European troubles that began on the periphery, in Greece, but have spread to the heartland, condemning Europe to a lost decade.</p> <p>An EU summit in Brussels on Thursday, the first since the summer break, will see more of the same \u2013 no big breakthrough, but a tug-of-war over a German push for yet more fiscal discipline in the eurozone, with governments and parliaments pressed to surrender powers over budgets and economic policy-making.</p> <p>Almost everyone else is fed up with this joyless, hectoring, endless campaign from Berlin. But there is no sign of the Germans giving up. It will fall to the French under the relatively untested leadership of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande to lead the resistance. On Sunday the French prime minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, spelled out an agenda diametrically opposed to Germany's.</p> <p>In this tussle, Britain, as has become the pattern, will stand on the sidelines, increasingly disengaged in the creation of a two-tier Europe \u2013 a federalised eurozone of 17 countries for now, plus the other 10.</p> <p>It may be a maddeningly slow process. But it all adds up to a seismic shift in the politics of Europe, the way power is wielded and policy-making discharged. There are multiple factors and dynamics involved: east versus west, north versus south, big versus small, EU institutions versus national governments. But in the end, the latest European dispensation will probably be settled by the big three \u2013 which in essence may mean the Germans are up, the French are down, and the Brits are out.</p> <p> The immediate business of Greece and Spain is unlikely to be granted much quality time on Thursday and Friday. Instead, the summit will be consumed by three new moves \u2013 all big federalising eurozone steps, all originating in Berlin, and all heavily contested.</p> <p>The first is to make the European Central Bank the supervisor of the eurozone's banks. The other two, unveiled last week by the EU's fixer-in-chief, Herman Van Rompuy of Belgium, who chairs the summits, are to bind national eurozone governments into annual \"contracts\" committing them to structural reforms of their labour markets, welfare and pension systems. The corollary to this, the third item, is to establish a modest, federal eurozone \"budget\" (quite distinct from the EU budget). It is modelled on the way Germany redistributes funds among its federal states, and would be used to cushion the impact of the reforms deemed necessary by the \"contracts\".</p> <p>On these three points, parties as various as the British, the Swedes, the east Europeans, the Dutch, Luxembourg and France have big issues. They are part of the gameplan cobbled together by Van Rompuy to \"complete\" the currency union, a blueprint that is to be finalised by December.</p> <p>The French are bristling at anything that smacks of surrendering parliamentary sovereignty, arguing that Berlin's grand plans can wait \u2013 the urgent issue is to fix Greece and Spain and restore confidence in the euro. \"Harmonise yes, but preserving independent decision-taking,\" Ayrault said in an interview. \"The logic is for a federation of nation states rather than for a federal Europe. The latter would mean that national parliaments would lose their budgetary sovereignty. The French parliament is very attached to that.\"</p> <p>He dismissed German calls for a eurozone \"political union\" as the wrong idea at the wrong time. But France's clout at Europe's top table is not what it was. If the euro is to be saved, the likelihood is that it will be according to a script written largely, though not exclusively, in Berlin.</p> <p>Crucially, what the proposals from Van Rompuy do not say is that the European treaties need to be reopened to make the mooted changes possible. That's a climbdown by Germany, which has long been insisting on reopening the Lisbon treaty but has recently gone quiet on the issue. It is also a concession to France, where a refashioned treaty retooling the eurozone would have needed a referendum which Hollande will do his utmost to avoid.</p> <p>The moves towards eurozone integration without a treaty revision put Cameron in a tight spot. His apparent scheme to negotiate a new minimalist British settlement within the EU and then put it to the vote either in a UK referendum or in a general election hinges on the Lisbon treaty being reopened.</p> <p>Top people in Brussels are now saying that Cameron has a weak hand and may find himself spearheading the calls for treaty renegotiation himself when he had been hoping that the others would open the door for him.</p> <p>The attitude towards the Conservative party's European policies is summed up in the observation, often heard among policy-makers, that EU capitals are not trying to push Britain out, but they are not going to try to keep it in either.</p> <p>The Anglo-Franco-German m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois is shifting into a tricky phase that will shape the Nobel peace laureate's future. The smart money has to be on a Berlin-Paris accommodation that allows Hollande to save face while advancing the German federalist agenda. It will take a while but the direction of travel is clear. But where will it leave Cameron and Britain?</p>",
  "<p>Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's government has been accused of spying on his defeated presidential rival in the runup to the Venezuelan elections, with leaked documents allegedly showing that secret service agents tracked the movements of Henrique Capriles and his family.</p> <p>Argentinian journalist Jorge Lanata, who said he was interrogated by secret service agents at Caracas airport last week as he left Venezuela, was due to release the files on television on Sunday night. The documents have not been authenticated but are said to come from secret service files.</p> <p>One report, dated 3 October, is titled Arrival of relatives of MUD presidential candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski, and tracks the arrival of the candidate's aunt, Andrea Radonski, and nine others at La Chinita airport.</p> <p>Another, marked Secret, states that \"with regard to the monitoring under way of the main personalities from the national political arena passing through the International Airport Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar de Maiquet\u00eda, it is observed that presidential candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski, has not made any trips since 6 August 2012, when he arrived from Maracaibo on board airship 215T\".</p> <p>Others documents report on the infiltration of student groups and he movement of foreign journalists covering last Sunday's polls.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/09/argentina-journalist-venezuela-detain\" title=\"\">Lanata said secret service agents questioned him for two hours in the basement of Caracas airport</a>, and deleted data from his team's computers, cellphones and cameras before allowing them to leave the country. \"They wanted to know where we had got the documents from,\" said Lanata, who was to reveal their contents on his news programme <em>Periodismo Para Todos</em> (Journalism for All).</p> <p>Last week, Lanata released documents apparently showing how he and his team were being tracked by the secret service during their stay in Venezuela.</p> <p>\"They kept on asking me for my email password because they wanted to see what other documents I had,\" said Nicol\u00e1s Wi\u00f1azki, a journalist on Lanata's team. \"They thought they had found it when they found my scribbled password for the WiFi at my hotel.\"</p> <p>Wi\u00f1azki refused to give the agents his password and after nearly two hours in the basement of Maiquet\u00eda international airport, he and the rest of Lanata's team were returned their passports, as well as their now emptied cellphones, cameras and computers, and allowed to board their plane to Buenos Aires.</p> <p>Lanata says he is convinced the documents are genuine because of the interrogation. \"The SEBIN (secret service) agents kept asking how we got hold of the documents that we had already aired, so those were definitely authentic. These ones about Capriles came from the same source.\"</p> <p>Lanata, a critic of the Ch\u00e1vez government and his ally, Argentina's president Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, expects a strong reaction to his broadcast. \"They could charge me with violating Venezuelan secrecy laws. I suppose they could bar me from ever returning to Venezuela or ask for my extradition from Argentina, that would be a great story too.\"</p>",
  "<p>With their proxies dispatched to do battle on the weekly round of political talks shows, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney went to ground on Sunday to swot up ahead of a crucial second presidential debate in the still tight electoral race.</p> <p>Their head-to-head in New York on Tuesday serves as a chance for the White House incumbent to redeem himself after a lacklustre first encounter with his Republican rival.</p> <p>A resulting bump in the polls has reinvigorated the Romney cause with three weeks to go until America goes to the polls. But taking a cue from his deputy, Joe Biden \u2013 who opted for full-throttled attack in his debate with Republican counterpart, Paul Ryan \u2013 pundits are expecting a more combative president in this week's town-hall-style encounter.</p> <p>The candidates will be answering questions from members of the audience during the televised event. The less formal setting could work to Obama's advantage \u2013 the Democrat often appears more at ease in such settings, especially compared with Romney, who can come across as aloof.</p> <p>In any event, the president is seemingly taking no chances.</p> <p>While his Republican rival was pressing the flesh in the key battleground state of Ohio on Saturday, Obama had already retreated to Williamsburg, Virginia, which will serve as his debate camp HQ until Tuesday's clash.</p> <p>His aides have suggested he is devoting more time to practise for the event than he did a fortnight ago.</p> <p>Romney returned to his home in Massachusetts late on Saturday for his preparations. His campaign has seemingly been buoyed up by a strong performance in the first debate.</p> <p>Despite Biden faring well in last week's vice-presidential head-to-head, the Republicans have continued to make the campaign running in recent days, notably over the issue of whether the White House knew of a request to expand security at its consulate in Benghazi, Libya, before a deadly attack by militants.</p> <p>Obama will be looking to halt his rival's momentum with a better performance on Tuesday.</p> <p>On Sunday, his campaign adviser, Robert Gibbs, hinted at a more aggressive approach. \"I think you'll see somebody who's very passionate about the choice that our country faces, and putting that choice in front of voters,\" he told CNN's State of the Union.</p> <p>The Romney camp, however, seemed largely unperturbed, with aide Ed Gillespie saying: \"Well, the president can change his style, he can change his tactics. He can't change his record and he can't change his policies.\"</p>",

  "<p>When Karl Marx predicted class struggle between capital and labour he probably did not envisage Cheryl Lawrence, a casino pastry chef and single mother, cruising into battle down the Las Vegas Freeway reciting a quote from the Disney film Finding Nemo: \"Just keep swimming, just keep swimming.\"</p> <p>Nor, it is fair to assume, did the German philosopher envisage a group of casino-owner billionaires using their fortunes and clout to flood airwaves with political advertisements to tilt an election their way.</p> <p>Yet here in Nevada, 129 years after Marx's death, capital and labour are locked in a test of strength which could help determine the presidential election.</p> <p>On one side the Culinary Union, representing Lawrence and 55,000 other casino cooks, bell hops and chambermaids, is investing its formidable organisational power in a get-out-the-vote drive for President Barack Obama.</p> <p>On the other side the gaming moguls <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/sheldon-adelson/\">Sheldon Adelson</a>, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/steve-wynn/\">Steve Wynn</a> and <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/joselambiet/2011/11/22/donald-trump-claims-hes-worth-7-billion/\">Donald Trump</a>, with a combined worth greater than $25bn, are investing their reputations and chequebooks to promote Mitt Romney.</p> <p>At stake are the state's six electoral college votes, a small but potentially decisive prize in a tight presidential race. Opinion polls suggest a virtual tie in Nevada, Obama with 47%, Romney with 46%, meaning just a few votes could determine the result.</p> <p>\"I don't think it's a fair fight but you have to do everything you can to level the field,\" said Lawrence, 36, who usually bakes cakes at MGM casino but has taken leave to register and mobilise voters across the city.</p> <p>\"If you have unlimited funding you're going to have the upper hand. But if you're out on the street, the sun beating down, sweating, hot, tired, you just have to keep going until you ring the last bell.\" Lawrence has stuck the \"keep swimming\" mantra, a line from the Finding Nemo character Dory, on her dashboard for inspiration.</p> <p>There is nothing new in unions backing a Democrat and big business backing a Republican but the 2010 supreme court ruling allowing Super Pacs \u2013 privately run political action committees bankrolled by hundreds of millions of dollars \u2013 has pitted Nevada's casino owners and their workers in an unprecedented duel.</p> <p>\"Before moguls would give money to their lobbyists and keep their mouths shut. But now they're so desperate to get Obama out of the White House they're on the nightly news blasting and seething against the president,\" said John L Smith, a commentator who writes columns and books about casino owners.</p> <p>Both sides cast the election in existential, even apocalyptic terms. \"This is not just about us,\" Geoconda Arguello-Kline, the Culinary Union president, told dozens of red T-shirted, cheering canvassers in a \"war room\" filled with maps, phones and campaign materials. \"It's about protecting the workers of this country. Romney wants to completely destroy unions.\"</p> <p>The moguls, for their part, warn of socialist plague. In a television interview last week <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2012/10/09/steve_wynn_on_obama_ill_be_damned_if_ill_have_him_lecture_me.html\">Wynn accused Obama</a> of waging \"class warfare\" and wreaking economic \"destruction\".</p> <p>Adelson has given conservative groups an estimated $70m in this election and said he will do \"whatever it takes\" to oust Obama. Trump, unabashed by Obama's Hawaiian birth certificate, has repeatedly depicted the president as a possibly foreign-born left-wing extremist.</p> <p>Some critics say a yearning for tax breaks and lighter regulation potentially worth billions in extra profits drives the intervention, but the tycoons say their goal is market-friendly policies to revive the economy and help ordinary Americans.</p> <p>Sig Rogich, a Las Vegas-based Republican consultant who advised Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr, and works with Adelson, defended the mogul's right to wade into the election. \"This is a country built on the principle of freedom of speech. When George Soros funded the other side no one complained.\"</p> <p>Adelson, who owns Las Vegas Sands, deserved credit for not hiding his contributions, said Rogich. \"He could easily have done so. You have to admire the truthfulness of standing up and telling the world that's he's responsible for the message.\"</p> <p>Whatever the casino owners' motives, their strategy in Nevada is clear: fire up the Republican base in rural areas and Washoe county, which includes Reno, and reduce Obama's lead among Latinos in Clark county, which includes Las Vegas.</p> <p>Adelson-funded Super Pacs hammer Obama and the Democrats' Senate candidate, Shelley Berkley, with ads saturating Nevada airwaves in English and Spanish. Bilingual leaflets \u2013 some voters have reported nine per day \u2013 jam letterboxes.</p> <p>Newly formed conservative groups such as Nevada Hispanics canvass voters at home, at supermarkets and at community events \u2013 mimicking a venerable Democratic and union strategy.</p> <p>\"We have very different ideologies but our campaigns have become more similar,\" said Yvanna Cancela, political director of the Culinary Union. \"Republicans used to stick to television and mail drops but they've learned being out in the field works. This means we need to be even more organised and to knock on every door.\"</p> <p>Which is why dozens of shop stewards and activists like Lawrence have taken unpaid leave \u2013 with employers' permission - to campaign full time until election day even though their union pay tends to be less than regular salaries and overtime.</p> <p>\"We don't do this for the money, trust me,\" said Lawrence. \"We do it because it's important.\" An African American originally from New York, she wished to set an example for her seven-year-old son. \"Statistically African American males don't make it. But when my son puts on a tie for school, he says he's going to be President Obama some day.\"</p> <p>With the race so tight she felt an obligation to register and mobilise as many union members as possible, knocking on doors every day from 11am to 7pm, sometimes later.</p> <p>\"Oh oh,\" she said earlier this week, approaching a yard with a huge dog. \"It's a horse.\"</p> <p>At one house Norma Gonzalez, 25, a casino worker-turned housewife, said she was planning to vote for Romney because Obama spent too much time \"gallivanting\" with celebrities like Jay-Z. A young boy tugged at her sleeve.</p> <p>Lawrence did not miss a beat. \"Well, as a mother, just like you, I'd like to talk a little bit about Romney's policies on women's health and education.\"</p> <p>\"OK,\" said Gonzalez.</p> <p>Five minutes later Gonzalez said she was no longer sure about Romney. Lawrence left her with several leaflets, including one with a picture of Sheldon Adelson and a bilingual exhortation: \"El dinero de los Super Pacs solo puede comprar una eleccion si no votas. Tienes que votar.\" Super Pac money can only buy an election if you don't vote. You have to vote.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 16 October 2012.

  "<p>A senior adviser to Barack Obama has accused the president's Republican challenger Mitt Romney of attempting to \"exploit\" an attack on the US consulate in Libya for political gain.</p> <p>Speaking on Fox News Sunday, David Axelrod, a key member of the president's inner circle, said there was \"no doubt\" that Romney was \"working hard to exploit the issue\".</p> <p>It comes amid growing pressure on the White House to disclose if any senior administration figures were informed of a request for increased diplomatic security at its Benghazi compound prior to the attack in which four Americans, including ambassador Chris Stevens, were killed.</p> <p>Exactly who in the White House was aware of the request has become an issue in the election campaign in recent days, after vice-president Joe Biden suggested during a debate Thursday that neither he nor Obama had been informed.</p> <p>\"We weren't told they wanted more security; we did not know they wanted more security.\"</p> <p>Republicans have accused the vice-president of misleading Americans over the remarks.</p> <p>Romney campaign adviser Ed Gillespie told Fox News Sunday that Biden had directly contradicted evidence given to a congressional oversight and government reform committee last week.</p> <p>A diplomatic cable presented to the political body shows that Stevens asked the state department for an additional 11 security personnel just weeks before the attack.</p> <p>Axelrod suggested that when Biden spoke of \"we\" in his comments denying knowledge of the ambassadors request prior to the assault, he was referring only to himself and Obama.</p> <p>Speaking on the same show, Gillespie accused the president and vice-president of trying to pin the blame to the state department.</p> <p>He said: \"Clearly \u2026 what we have been seeing is an effort by President Obama and vice-president Biden to say 'No, it's really Secretary Clinton. It was the state department you ought to be looking at and talking to and criticising here or questioning here, as opposed to us in the White House.'\"</p>",

  "<p>Mauritania's president, Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, is in hospital in France after a bizarre incident in which he was shot in the stomach, apparently by mistake, by his own troops.</p> <p>Authorities in the west African nation, regarded as a key in the battle against al-Qaida in the region, insisted the shooting, which took place 25 miles outside the capital, was an accident.</p> <p>Before leaving for France the president appeared on state television from hospital in Mauritania. \"I want to calm all citizens,\" Abdel Aziz said. \"I want to reassure everyone about my state of health after this incident committed by error.\"</p> <p>The French government said Abdel Aziz had been admitted to the Percy-Clamart military hospital in Paris.</p> <p>Mauritanian sources said \"jumpy\" military guards at a checkpoint mistook Abdel Aziz, who was returning to the capital, Nouakchott, after a trip to the desert, for a security threat.</p> <p>\"Security forces have been on high alert for the last six days, jumpy, and were concerned that something might happen. Obviously this incident is very unfortunate,\" a diplomatic source told the Guardian.</p> <p>\"We believe the shooting was an accident,\" the source said. \"The situation has now returned to normal \u2013 the international airports are open, and the virtual lockdown imposed after the incident has now been lifted.\"</p> <p>The Mauritanian press reported the president spent more than eight hours at the military hospital in Nouakchott, where he was operated on by two doctors, and is being flown to France by a Moroccan air ambulance.</p> <p>Reports say the military and presidential guard worked together to protect the president during the medical procedure, amid scenes of chaos on the streets.</p> <p>The information minister, Hadi ould el-Mahjoub, said the president's injuries were not life threatening. \"He was lightly wounded. He was able to get down from the car and walk without difficulty on his arrival at the hospital.\"</p> <p>On Sunday morning, military checkpoints, which have been conducting routine searches and identity card checks around the capital for several weeks, were withdrawn.</p> <p>Despite apparent calm in the capital, with markets open and ministries functioning as usual, questions remained about the incident, following initial reports that the shooting was a foiled coup attempt.</p> <p>\"There have been disgruntled middle-ranking soldiers who have been dealt with very swiftly by the regime,\" said a senior military source.</p> <p>\"There are a lot of questions going around. The question security is asking is why didn't the soldiers manning the checkpoints know the presidential convoy was passing. The president is always very heavily protected, his security detail is excellent.\"</p> <p>Officials declined to comment on what happened to the soldiers at the checkpoint, or if anyone else in the convoy was hurt.</p> <p>The shooting comes amid months of turbulence for Mauritania, which neighbours northern Mali \u2013 where al-Qaida-linked groups control vast swaths of territory \u2013 and which has been the subject of explicit threats by extremist groups.</p> <p>Around 100,000 refugees from Mali have fled into Mauritania, which has a population of 3.5 million, placing additional strain on resources as the country struggles with a food crisis engulfing the Sahel region.</p> <p>The country is also facing internal upheaval, with growing dissatisfaction with Abdel Aziz, who seized power in a military coup in 2008 before winning presidential elections a year later. Nouakchott has been the scene of opposition marches in recent months, with some commentators describing calls for Abdel Aziz to resign signs of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/may/26/mauritania-overlooked-arab-spring\" title=\"\">Mauritanian Arab spring</a>.</p> <p>\"The official line is it was an accident but it's really not very clear at the moment what happened,\" a western diplomat said.</p>",

But GM was bailed out by taxpayers and then went on to slash workers' wages while padding CEO salaries. Obama says he'll create 1m manufacturing jobs by 2016, but these are all low-wage, insecure jobs with poor benefits. </p> <p>Both Romney and Obama promise to <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/interactive/2012/09/20129308542614575.html\">slash public spending</a> on education, healthcare, job training, social security and the environment. And both are calling for corporate income tax cuts. These policies are not only bad for working families, they're killers of economic growth. That's because capitalism doesn't work when capital doesn't move. And capital doesn't move when our government promotes the hoarding, rather than the redistribution, of capital.</p> <p>In the short term, policies that favor Wall Street make a few people very rich, but in the long term, those same policies create massive inequality that cause Wall Street \u2013 and the rest of us \u2013 to crash. It's time to take Wall Street out of the driver's seat and to free the truly productive segments of working America to make this economy work for all of us.</p> <p>This is the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Why not use a similar strategy to FDR's for getting us out of it? Under the <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/fmc/interviews/kennedy.htm\">New Deal of the 1930s</a>, unemployment rates were substantially reduced, and millions of jobs were created.</p> <p>For this reason, I propose a <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2012/7/13/green_new_deal_organizer_physician_jill\">Green New Deal for the 2010s</a>, which \u2013 unlike the doomed-to-fail proposals of Obama and Romney \u2013 is proven to work. The Green New Deal will create 25m jobs by implementing nationally funded, but locally controlled, direct employment initiatives. These would offer public-sector jobs that can be \"stored\" in job banks in order to take up any slack in private-sector employment.</p> <p>The Green New Deal protects the right to quality healthcare, to be achieved through a single-payer Medicare-for-all program; a tuition-free, quality, public education system from pre-school through college; decent affordable housing, including an immediate halt to all foreclosures and evictions; and the right to accessible and affordable utilities including heat, electricity, phone, internet and public transportation.</p> <p>The Green New Deal also provides grants and low-interest loans to grow green businesses and cooperatives, with an emphasis on small, locally-based companies that keep the wealth created by local labor circulating in the community \u2013 rather than being drained off to enrich absentee investors. We will redirect public research funds away from fossil fuels and other dead-end industries and toward sustainable energy systems such as wind, solar and geothermal. We will invest in sustainable, nontoxic materials, closed-loop cycles that eliminate waste and pollution, and organic agriculture, permaculture, and sustainable forestry.</p> <p>Most importantly, under the Green New Deal, we will build a financial system that is open, honest and stable, and a political system that protects the rights of voters, not the political parties and their corporate funders.</p> <p>Most Americans agree that the policies of the Green New Deal are exactly what we need. Yet, many voters remain afraid to vote their values. We've all been told to vote against politicians, not for policies. And the result has been, year after year, that the politics of fear has delivered everything we were afraid of: expanding war, the meltdown of the economy, and the dismantling of our civil liberties.</p> <p>Our society is at a breaking point: we may not survive four more years of Wall Street rule. We must answer the politics of fear with the politics of courage. The <a href=\"http://www.debates.org/\">Commission on Presidential Debates</a> has attempted to monopolize the discourse and limit our choices. But the debate about America's future that matters most is the debate that takes place within each of us.</p> <p>Our country desperately needs a Green New Deal. A vote for me is a mandate for those policies, not only in November, but for the months and years to come.</p>"
