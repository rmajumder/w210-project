  "<p>The comandante had not shown up for the rally, disappointing supporters in the sun-baked plaza, a triangle of cracked concrete amid a bustling outdoor market, but they made the best of it. A convoy of cars and trucks adorned with posters of&#xa0;the familiar jowly, smiling face slowly circled, blasting campaign songs from huge speakers. A middle-aged woman in red leggings shimmied to the&#xa0;beat of a campaign song blasting from speakers.</p> <p>Another handed out flyers with the election manifesto which outlined \"five great historic objectives\". One: \"Defend, expand and consolidate national independence.\" Two: \"Continue building Bolivarian socialism of the 21st century in Venezuela as an alternative to destructive and savage capitalism.\" Three: \"Make Venezuela an economic, social and political power within the growing power of Latin America and the Caribbean.\" Four: \"Develop a new international geopolitics forming a multicentric and pluripolar world to achieve equilibrium in the universe and guarantee planetary peace.\" Five: \"Preserve life on the planet and save the human species.\"</p> <p>No one ever accused Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of thinking small. He casts politics as an existential contest between good and evil, the oppressed and the oppressor. The next battle is on Sunday, when he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2012/sep/29/hugo-chavez\" title=\"\">seeks a third term</a> to extend his<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2009/feb/02/hugo-chavez-venezuela\" title=\"\"> 14-year rule</a> to 2019. There is a clenched tension in the streets, for no one knows what will happen. Some polls give the president a wide lead, others show him trailing. Wild rumours fill the air: Ch\u00e1vez's family is selling its cattle herds and trucks in anticipation of fleeing to Cuba; pro-Ch\u00e1vez militias are preparing to seal off parts of Caracas; the opposition is planning to assassinate Ch\u00e1vez. Nonsense, but people are worried enough to stockpile water, batteries, tinned food and toilet paper.</p> <p>The election will decide the fate of Ch\u00e1vez, 58, and his revolution. Lose, and the revolution dies. Win, and it survives, but only for as long as the leader has a pulse. Ch\u00e1vez, Gabriel Garcia Marquez once noted, had \"a body of reinforced concrete\". His energy was superhuman, his appetites prodigious. He drank more than 30 shots of sweet, black coffee daily, fuelling a routine that included 3am phone calls to ministers and aides. No longer. Cancer treatment has bloated and debilitated the comandante. After his diagnosis Ch\u00e1vez changed the slogan \"Fatherland, socialism or death\" to \"We will live and we will win\". All references to \"muerte\" in official discourse have been expunged. \"There will be no death here, we must live,\" he instructed. But few believe his claims to be cured of a disease whose exact nature and location remains a closely guarded secret. Some palace insiders whisper it is terminal.</p> <p>The revolution hangs by a thread. There appears to be no plan B, no successor. Ch\u00e1vez surrounded himself mostly with mediocrities, valuing loyalty over competence or, it turned out, honesty. With the chief ailing they look lost. A rally in Catia, a Ch\u00e1vista bastion near the presidential palace, Miraflores, was abruptly cancelled in disarray. The foreign minister, Nicolas Maduro, put on a brave face but a microphone caught his murmured words: \"<em>Que cagada.</em>\" What a fuck-up. Not elegant but if Ch\u00e1vez loses it will be the campaign's epitaph.</p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez's absence from many rallies has given him the air of Banquo's ghost. He hovers in the form of television appearances, and occasional, relatively brief public appearances, an echo of the man who used to barnstorm the country and wade into crowds. Winning the election under such circumstances would be a triumph, and he may well pull it off, but it will not shake off the sense of <em>fin de regime</em>.</p> <p>His legacy will be debated for decades, much as people still argue over Juan Peron in Argentina. Many outsiders made up their minds long ago. There was Ch\u00e1vez the dictator who jailed opponents, sponsored terrorists and left his people hungry. And there was Ch\u00e1vez the hero who empowered the poor, deepened democracy and stood up to the US. While based in Caracas for the Guardian from 2006 to March this year I&#xa0;would hear both versions on trips abroad. Dublin, Shanghai, San Francisco, it didn't matter where, opinion was polarised and passionate. And completely depressing. This was Venezuela of fantasy, a cartoonish projection, each side parroting simplicities and distortions as revealed truth. The reality was more complex and fascinating but if I broached <a href=\"www.guprod.gnl/commentisfree/2012/sep/27/hugo-chavez-cult-oil-venezuela\" title=\"\">oil dependency</a>, or details that determined the fate of the revolution, eyes would glaze over. Few wanted to hear nuances of political economy. They wanted tales of the demon or gospels of faith.</p> <p>There was, arguably, a duality to Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. The poor boy from the plains who loved to sing and tell stories rose up army ranks and attempted a bloody coup in 1992 against an unpopular but democratically elected government. Six years later he took Miraflores via the ballot box but in power created a personality cult, abolished term limits, curbed private media and put the armed forces, legislature, judiciary and state oil company, PDVSA, under his personal control. He turned a blind eye to Farc guerrilla camps near the Colombian border and hailed the likes of Mugabe, Gaddafi and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/aug/02/venezuela-hugo-chavez-syria-video\" title=\"\">Assad</a> as brothers.</p> <p>But the same president was adored by millions of his people, won free (if not always fair) elections, survived a US-backed coup, accepted electoral defeat (a 2007 referendum), spent oil revenues on health clinics, literacy courses and social programmes, slashed poverty, devolved power to communal councils, stood up to George Bush over Iraq, encouraged regional pride and assertiveness across Latin America and did it all with charisma and flair. The occasional clowning and buffoonery which grabbed headlines concealed a shrewd, sophisticated political mind.</p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez, in other words, was \u2013 is \u2013 a hybrid: a democrat and autocrat, a progressive and a bully. His \"Bolivarian revolution\", named after the 19th-century revolutionary Sim\u00f3n Bolivar, has embodied these contradictions. What, then, has it wrought these 14 years?</p> <p>For Ruth Guerrero, a Chavista canvasser in Petare, a hillside slum in eastern Caracas, the answer was simple. \"Hope.\" The 56-year-old mother of three grew up poor and unemployed, unable to follow a yen for learning. Thanks to \"Mision Robinson\", an adult education course, one of myriad social programmes, Guerrero obtained a law diploma and now earns $380 a month teaching at a Bolivarian university. \"Before that I had lived a life full of injustice. Ch\u00e1vez has been my teacher and leader.\"</p> <p>Guerrero's effort to hand out leaflets garnered little attention from passers-by, however, and she feared friends and neighbours would abandon Ch\u00e1vez. Polls show Petare voting for the opposition. \"I'm worried. I keep telling them that the president doesn't like rubbish in the streets, or potholes, or insecurity, that he wants us to tackle them together.\"</p> <p>Guerrero was referring to the single most damning critique of the revolution, one that has nothing to do with Ch\u00e1vez's democratic credentials. Venezuela is falling apart. In the case of infrastructure, literally. Roads are crumbling, bridges falling, refineries exploding. A wheezing power grid condemns much of the country to rolling blackouts. Public hospitals, with a few exceptions, are dank, dingy affairs where patients must supply their own bedsheets, bandages and food.</p> <p>Prisons are filthy and riven by violence which claimed 500 lives last year. To massage statistics there was a tacit deal between authorities and some gang leaders to hang victims so they could be counted as suicide, a mid-ranking penal official told me. She had armfuls of documentation and grisly photographs. \"But how can I use it? If I do, I'll be fired, lose my pension and then be prosecuted.\"</p> <p>Murder rates have more than doubled, filling morgues and making Caracas deadlier than Baghdad, reflecting an underfunded, politicised judicial system. Kidnappers, sometimes in league with police, snatch victims from cars, shopping malls, university campuses and bus stops. A recent security plan did not reassure \u2013 by some counts it was Ch\u00e1vez's 20th such initiative. Lack of security is one reason so many young Venezuelans are emigrating, giving Caracas the melancholy nickname City of Farewells.</p> <p>The economy is not falling apart. It is growing about 5% this year, with unemployment of around 8%. It is, however, warping. Under Ch\u00e1vez Venezuela, which claims bigger oil reserves than Saudi Arabia, has seen prices leap from $9 a barrel to over $100, gushing about $980bn through PDVSA.</p> <p>Ahistoric bonanza begging a big question: where is the cash? Social programmes and subsidies \u2013 you can fill a car's petrol tank for around 50 cents \u2013 account for some, as do arms purchases and (mostly stalled) infrastructure projects. But much vanished. Ch\u00e1vez is no Mobutu. He did not build palaces in the jungle to store pink champagne. He did, however, create a tangle of economic controls which let opportunists in government, and those with friends in government, siphon off billions of public money.</p> <p>Few outsiders grasp how profoundly restrictions such as Cadivi \u2013 a currency control agency that tried to shore up the ever weakening Venezuelan bolivar \u2013 perverted the economy and spawned a class of high-rolling parasites nicknamed \"boligarchs\". Ch\u00e1vez occasionally complained about them but let them get rich as long as they supported the government.</p> <p>Their revolution has been one of dodgy bond issues, government contracts and currency manipulation, yielding yachts, Rolexes and Hummers. They pay fashion designers such as Giovanni Scutaro, who used to dress Ch\u00e1vez, astonishing sums for outfits. \"When people from the United States and Europe come here and see our weddings, they go: 'Wow, so much money.' There is no equilibrium between perceptions from afar and the reality of what is happening inside the country,\" Scutaro says.</p> <p>Last week <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/26/us-venezuela-chavez-fund-idUSBRE88P0N020120926\" title=\"\">a Reuters investigation</a> detailed how more than half of public investment churns into secretive funds controlled by Ch\u00e1vez with no oversight by auditors or congress.</p> <p>One fund, called Fonden, swallowed about $100bn. Some was spent on white elephants \u2013 an abandoned newsprint factory, a \"city of aluminum\" \u2013 and on ill-fated investments in Ecuadorean bonds and Lehman Brothers-issued derivatives. In a functioning, accountable democracy this would be a huge scandal but Venezuela's government \u2013 plus state prosecutors and media \u2013 ignores it. \"That is not Ch\u00e1vez's money. That money belongs to 29 million Venezuelans and as such the information should be available to everyone,\" said Carlos Ramos, an opposition legislator.</p> <p>Harassing the private sector \u2013 investment evaporated amid expropriations \u2013 and bungled management of multiplying state enterprises translated into shrivelled agriculture and industry. Huge imports to fill the gap, though you would never guess it from Orwellian rhetoric trumpeting \"food sovereignty\" and \"manufacturing independence\". The result is increased dependence on oil, now accounting for 96% of export earnings versus 80% a decade ago. That is why so many Venezuelans end up on pavements selling knick-knacks (they are counted as employed), or watching the clock in decaying state enterprises.</p> <p>This does not add up to collapse. There are always petrodollars to stuff into cracks. But analysts say that, regardless of who wins the election, Venezuela faces a grim economic reckoning. The economy is growing now only because of a splurge in government spending and borrowing, mostly from China.</p> <p>In the headquarters of PDVSA, his office overlooking Avenida Libertador, one of Ch\u00e1vez's top oil officials told me that the boss started as a pragmatist but turned ideological after opponents tried to oust him in a 2002 coup and general strike \u2013 soon after which oil revenues began booming. Then, in hushed tones of heresy: \"It was a historic opportunity that was wasted. He doesn't understand economics. Ch\u00e1vez doesn't know how to manage. As a manager he's a disaster.\"</p> <p>Venezuela's revolution has no gulags, no torture chambers, but in wasted potential lies tragedy. Here was a sublimely gifted politician with empathy for the poor and the power of Croesus \u2013 and the result, fiasco.</p> <p>Neither side likes to acknowledge it but the revolution is in many ways a continuum of oil-fuelled populism dating back half a century, notably that of the giddy, spendthrift 1974-79 administration of Carlos Andres Perez, the mercurial president Ch\u00e1vez tried to overthrow in 1992. The difference is Ch\u00e1vez had even more money, more power, more showmanship.</p> <p>It was easy to overlook the blunders while he strutted the stage, singing and dancing, blowing kisses, riding a bike, a horse, a tank, holding court from his desk, blending folk tales with ideological thunder, commandeering airwaves to talk and talk, sometimes for eight hours straight, oratorical marathons which exhausted aides, paralysed opponents and sucked up the oxygen.</p> <p>If Ch\u00e1vez were healthy he would have walked this election, his skills of enchantment steeled, as ever, by control of state resources and institutions. Instead, he has rationed his public appearances and relied on television to simulate the magic of old while his youthful opponent, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/30/venezuela-chavez-challenger-election-pledges\" title=\"\">Henrique Capriles</a>, bursts into villages, towns and cities denouncing their dilapidation.</p> <p>When visiting the Caruachi hydro-electric plant to whip up support Ch\u00e1vez suffered the indignity of being heckled by workers demanding unpaid wages and the restoration of collective-bargaining rights. His microphone failed and a back-up sound system transmitted what sounded like shouts of \"justicia\", justice, at which point state television cut the broadcast. A nation accustomed to highly choreographed presidential events with handpicked audiences gasped at the glimpse behind the curtain.</p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez can boast genuine accomplishments. He put poverty and social exclusion at the forefront of debate. He made millions feel they had an ally in government. And he called time on US browbeating in Latin America. But the price was high. Gutted institutions, a <em>caudillo </em>(strongman) cult, economic dysfunction. After a recent spate of bad news \u2013 a prison riot, a collapsed bridge, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/27/venezuela-oil-refinery-explosion-chavez\" title=\"\">an oil refinery accident</a> \u2013 Ch\u00e1vez reached for a telling metaphor. \"The show must go on.\" Maybe it will, maybe he will win, and live to rule. But what cost the spectacle?</p> <p>\u2022<em> Rory Carroll's book about Ch\u00e1vez, Comandante, will be published next March by Canongate in the UK and by Penguin Press in the US. </em></p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney should be winning. If, as the pollsters repeatedly tell us, the economy is the most important issue in this election \u2013 and more people say they have faith in Mr Romney's economic management than they do in the course the Democrat incumbent is setting \u2013 why is Barack Obama <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/2012_elections_electoral_college_map.html\" title=\"\">pulling away in key states</a>? The economic statistics point to a healthy Romney lead: unemployment refuses to drop below 8%; disposable income has declined; second-quarter growth is anaemic.</p> <p>All of which is grist to Mr Romney's mill. So why is Mr Obama leading by <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/politico44/2012/10/poll-obama-leads-points-among-women-137200.html\" title=\"\">18 points among women</a>? This is important, because women are more inclined to vote Democrat than men are. Mr Obama is developing healthy leads in the eight swing states. In New Hampshire, he has built up <a href=\"http://www.wmur.com/news/politics/Poll-shows-Obama-with-15-point-lead-in-NH/-/9857748/16806904/-/evbu84z/-/index.html\" title=\"\">a 15-point lead</a>. The energy levels that drive people to get out and vote are with the Democrats, not the Republicans. Why? Other factors must be at work.</p> <p>Could it be that Mitt's biggest selling problem is himself? He is no first-timer. This is his fourth attempt at running for any kind of election and, by now, someone in his menage should have figured how to iron out wrinkles in his image. But, apparently and incredibly, not. Polling by the <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2012/09/19/obama-ahead-with-stronger-support-better-image-and-lead-on-most-issues/\" title=\"\">Pew Research Center</a> \u2013 and this was before last month's appearance of that infamous video in which Mr Romney said that 47% of Americans were dependent on government handouts \u2013 shows Mr Obama knocking spots off his rival when judged on personal qualities. Around 64% found Mr Obama inspiring, whereas 43% found Mr Romney hard to like; 51% felt proud of Mr Obama, 48% worried about Mr Romney. This does not mean Mr Obama is doing a good job selling his job-creation policies; it means that Mr Romney is doing an even worse job selling his.</p> <p>On Wednesday night, in the first of three presidential TV debates, Mr Romney will have to achieve the impossible: no candidate who scored higher unfavourable ratings than favourable ones in September has won in the last six presidential elections. Mr Romney's 47% gaffe went down badly among independent voters. The New Hampshire figures are a further reflection of the disenchantment of independents. They should be his primary target because his party base has veered to the right, and yet, with Paul Ryan in tow, he is uniquely handicapped. Republicans in swing states are <a href=\"http://www.nationalmemo.com/six-republicans-who-are-fleeing-at-top-speed-from-the-ryan-budget/\" title=\"\">running away</a> from the budget he produced. <a href=\"http://www.nationalmemo.com/five-reasons-paul-ryan-is-already-a-worse-vp-choice-than-sarah-palin/6/\" title=\"\">Mr Ryan may be even more toxic a running mate</a> than Sarah Palin was for John McCain in 2008.</p> <p>We live in the age of the self-defeating candidate, and Mr Obama should resist the temptation to smile at the sight of an opponent with such a facility to stumble. But he can at least head into Wednesday's television debate in Denver with one huge advantage: Mr Obama can be himself; Mr Romney cannot.</p>",
  "<p>Vice-president Joe Biden has given Mitt Romney an unexpected gift on the eve of the first presidential debate: telling supporters at a campaign rally that the the middle class had been \"buried\" during Barack Obama's presidency.</p> <p>In a speech to supporters in Charlotte, North Carolina, Biden criticised Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan's tax plan, asking: \"How can they justify raising taxes on the middle class that has been buried the last four years?\"</p> <p>The remarks were immediately seized upon by Romney's campaign team, who said Biden's remarks were a \"stunning admission\". Biden was forced to try and row back from his comments, telling a crowd in Asheville, North Carolina, that the \"middle class was buried by the policies that Romney and Ryan have supported\".</p> <p>Biden was attempting to use his speech in Charlotte to attack Ryan ahead of the vice-presidential debate next week. Biden linked Ryan to Romney's leaked comments about the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/sep/18/mitt-romney-refuses-apologise-voters-video\">supposed dependency of 47% of Americans</a> and said Republicans would increase taxes on most Americans to fund tax cuts for the wealthy.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nlvqqNG4hr8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nlvqqNG4hr8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\"This is deadly earnest. How they can justify raising taxes on the middle class that has been buried the last four years? How in the Lord's name can they justify raising their taxes and these tax cuts?\" he said.</p> <p>The Romney campaign was swiftly into action. \"Vice-president Biden made a stunning admission today and we couldn't agree more: the middle class has been 'buried' under the last four years of this president's policies,\" said spokeswoman Amanda Henneberg.</p> <p>\"Under President Obama, the middle class has suffered from crushing unemployment, rising prices and falling incomes.\"</p> <p>Mitt Romney's twitter feed posted: \"Agree with @JoeBiden, the middle class has been buried the last 4 years, which is why we need a change in November.\" </p> <p>Democrats defended Biden's comments however, with spokeswoman Lis Smith criticising \"another desperate and out-of-context attack from the Romney campaign\".</p> <p>\"As the vice-president has been saying all year and again in his remarks today, the middle class was punished by the failed Bush policies that crashed our economy \u2013 and a vote for Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan is a return to those failed policies.\"</p> <p>Still, Biden was careful not to repeat the \"last four years\" line at his next stop on Tuesday. \"The middle class was buried by the policies that Romney and Ryan have supported,\" he told the crowd in Asheville, North Carolina, <a href=\" http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/wp/2012/10/02/joe-biden-corrects-himself/\">according to the Washington Post</a>.</p> <p>It is not the first time Biden has been criticised for comments made at the stump. In August <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/19/biden-accused-santorum-race-chains\">he told a crowd in Danville, Virginia</a>, that Romney's plans to loosen bank deregulation would harm ordinary people. \"They're going to put y'all back in chains,\" he added.</p>",
  "<p>A Chinese company sued Barack Obama on Tuesday for blocking its windfarm project in Oregon on the grounds it was a national security threat.</p> <p>Obama made the rare decision last week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/28/obama-blocks-chinese-firm-wind-farm\">to bar the company from buying four small windfarms</a> close to restricted air space used by a navy weapons training facility.</p> <p>The privately owned Ralls Corp responded on Tuesday by accusing Obama of overstepping his authority as president and adding his name to its lawsuit against the treasury department's foreign investment committee.</p> <p>The amended complaint alleges the committee and the president deprived Ralls of its property rights.</p> <p>\"By failing to provide Ralls with sufficient notice and opportunity to be heard prior to prohibiting its acquisition of the windfarms and imposing extraordinary restrictions on the use and enjoyment of its property interests, CFIUS and the president have unconstitutionally deprived Ralls of its property absent due process,\" the complaint said.</p> <p>The lawsuit comes at a time when Obama has been accused by Mitt Romney of failing to stand up for American businesses against unfair competition from China.</p> <p>The Obama camp meanwhile has run television ads claiming Romney's Bain Capital shut down American firms and shipped jobs overseas.</p> <p>Ralls, which is based in Delaware, is owned by two Chinese nationals and executives of the China-based firm Sany Group Company. It had planned to purchase four small plots, all near restricted navy air space, and install turbines made by the Sany Group.</p> <p>The navy uses the area around the windfarms for developing drones.</p> <p>Obama stepped in last week to order Ralls to remove all installations from the sites, and divest itself of the properties. The president was essentially reinforcing an order from the foreign investment committee handed down last July calling on Ralls to keep out of the sites in Oregon.</p> <p>It was the first time in 22 years a president had raised national security concerns to block foreign investment.</p> <p>The lawsuit, however, was seen as almost unprecedented, said Joshua Zive, a lawyer with Bracewell and Giuliani who has handled other cases with the foreign investment committee.</p> <p>\"It's always a tough battle going up against government and agency action,\" he said. \"Certainly in the case of national security issues you tend to find a broader amount of discretion given to government and agencies overall.\"</p>",
  "<p>There are a lot of big issues that you won't be hearing much about during the closing weeks of the presidential race.</p> <p>One of them is the war in Afghanistan. Don't expect either candidate to offer any fresh ideas \u2013 they have none \u2013 about how we are going to extricate ourselves from this decade-long quagmire. </p> <p>Campaign finance reform, arguably the most critical issue for the future of our democracy, is likewise off the table. <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/pres12/\">Both candidates</a> are neck deep in corporate cash and not inclined to bite the hand that is feeding them. The US economy remains in the doldrums, yet we are going to get little more than partisan finger-pointing instead of the tough talk about the systemic roots of America's economic decline that we need to hear.</p> <p>But in this campaign season, in which so many important issues are not being discussed, arguably the biggest of them all is global warming.</p> <p>Which is not to say that President Obama won't mention it. He already has. In his convention speech, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-01/presidential-showdown-evokes-last-call-for-climate-debate.html\">Obama stated</a> that \"Climate change is not a hoax.\" This was a swipe at Romney, who had made light of the issue in his own <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/glenn-hurowitz/romney-mocks-planet-will-_b_1845523.html\">acceptance speech</a> a week earlier: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"President Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans and to heal the planet. My promise is to help you and your family.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Romney got laughs and a standing ovation for this joke in Tampa. But it did not play well in the world beyond the convention floor where the candidate's words were widely regarded as only slightly less bizarre than Clint Eastwood's conversation with an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/31/clint-eastwood-chair-speech-romney\">empty chair</a>.</p> <p>In contrast, Obama pointed out that <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/energy/climate-change\">his administration</a> has increased investments in green energy, strengthened fuel economy standards on cars and tightened emissions limits on coal-fueled power plants. Romney, for his part, vowed in a TV ad broadcast in the coalmining swing state of Ohio that <a href=\"http://content.usatoday.com/communities/onpolitics/post/2012/06/mitt-romney-ad-100-days-swing-states-/1\">he will repeal</a> this regulation within 100 days of taking office. He also said that <a href=\"http://energy.nationaljournal.com/2012/08/sizing-up-romney-and-obama-ene.php\">he wants to strip</a> the EPA of its mandate under the Clean Air Act to restrict CO2 pollution.</p> <p>But that is as far as it is likely to go. The Republican nominee will do his best to avoid ever saying the words \"global warming\" during the next five weeks. The League of Conservation Voters <a href=\"http://www.lcv.org/media/press-releases/Coalition-Drops-Off-More-Than-160-000-Debate-Petitions-to-Jim-Lehrer.html\">has launched</a> a petition drive to get Jim Lehrer to ask about climate change, which it calls \"the greatest challenge of our generation\", during the first debate (on the economy) on 3 October.</p> <p>If Lehrer does so, don't expect the president to offer a serious new plan for reining in greenhouse gases. <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/22/climate-bill-senate-democ_n_656175.html\">He failed</a> to get approval for his own comprehensive energy and climate bill in the Senate two years ago, in what former Vice-president Al Gore and other environmentalists <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/climate-bill-r-i-p-20100721\">viewed</a> as a half-hearted, disorganized effort. And there is little evidence that Obama has the stomach for another fight over cap-and-trade with the Republicans anytime soon.</p> <p>Which is a crying shame. <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=scientists-seek-strategy-to-convey-seriousness-of-sea-level-rise\">Scientists predict</a> that if we don't act now to curb greenhouse gases, ocean levels will rise by a meter or more by the end of the century, threatening 10% of the world's population who live in low-lying coastal areas that are vulnerable to storm surges. Climate change will also play havoc with global agriculture. Monsoon patterns in Asia's rice basket <a href=\"http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-03-05/developmental-issues/31123921_1_kharif-crops-monsoon-rainfall-climate\">will be disrupted</a>. And arid regions in the US south-west and the Sahel <a href=\"http://www.sdsg.org/gunnison-basin/dust-deposition-on-snow/future-outlook/\">will become even drier</a>, leading to famine in Africa and elsewhere. A <a href=\"http://www.who.int/heli/risks/climate/climatechange/en/\">report by the World Health Organization</a> says that: \"Climatic changes already are estimated to cause over 150,000 deaths annually.\"</p> <p>A <a href=\"www.nrdc.org/globalwarming/cost/fcost.pdf\">Tufts University study (pdf)</a> predicts that the cost of climate change in America alone could be as high as 3.6% of US GDP, an estimated $3.8tn in today's dollars, by 2100. The report concludes that \"The longer we wait, the more painful and expensive the consequences will be.\"</p> <p>But don't expect this reality to intrude upon the current presidential contest. Both Romney and Obama see global warming as a no-win issue for them. Romney won't alienate his rightwing supporters by addressing something <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-09-30/global-warming-links-democrats-independents-isolating-romney\">most of them don't even believe</a> is happening. And Obama is convinced that he has nothing to gain from talking about cutting CO2 emissions, especially in the swing states of the rust belt where regulation of industry would be portrayed as a job-killer.</p> <p>The president may be underestimating public support for action on global warming. Attitudes appear to be shifting \u2013 partly in response to this summer's record temperatures and crop-killing drought, which afflicted over half of the country. One <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-07-18/record-heat-wave-pushes-u-dot-s-dot-belief-in-climate-change-to-70-percent\">survey showed</a> that belief in climate change is on the rise, most notably in the south and in Texas, which suffered the worst of the recent heatwave.</p> <p>Polls suggest that over 70% of Americans now believe that climate change is a reality. This is up from the 52% who held these views in 2010, according to a Brookings survey.</p> <p>Even more significant for the presidential race is the fact that <a href=\"http://www.pri.org/stories/science/environment/new-data-shows-undecided-voters-view-climate-change-as-factor-in-choosing-candidate-11642.html\">over half of currently undecided voters</a> say that global warming is one of several important issues that will guide their voting choice in November. A majority of those surveyed by the Yale Project on Climate Change believe that President Obama and the Congress need to do more to address this issue than they are currently doing. Granted, climate change remains an abstract issue for most Americans who are more focused on the state of the economy and matters that hit closer to home like entitlements and health policy.</p> <p>Still, it would arguably make political sense for the president to say more, if only to energize members of his own base \u2013 many of whom have been turned off by the perception that he has not fought hard enough for the environment. Obama could highlight the things that he has already accomplished: in addition to tightening pollution standards for cars and power plants, the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/11/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-weve-doubled-our-use-renewable-e/\">production of renewable energy has increased in the US by about 25% during the last four years</a> and tens of thousands of new jobs have been created as the result of tax cuts for green industries. The <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/04/19/466477/chart-how-obama-and-romney-compare-on-energy-issues/\">president has also called on</a> Congress to end tax breaks and cut subsidies for big oil and coal.</p> <p>Environmental activists applaud these moves, but say that they are not enough. They argue that the US, the world's largest producer of greenhouse gases <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/jan/31/world-carbon-dioxide-emissions-country-data-co2\">per capita</a> (China recently surpassed us in sheer volume), needs to lead the fight to limit carbon emissions, rather continuing to block global treaties as it has done in the past. Some have called on the president to mount a Manhattan Project on green energy, enlisting the national laboratories at Los Alamos and elsewhere for a major research and development push, which could position the US to take advantage of the growing market for inexpensive renewable energy technology.</p> <p>Barack Obama knows what the challenge is, should he be re-elected. Whether he has the political grit to do battle on cutting greenhouse gases the second time around remains to be seen.</p>",
  "<p>The taskforce charged with prosecuting US banks behind the excesses of the housing boom and bust has brought its first case \u2013 to mixed reviews.</p> <p>President Barack Obama <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/24/obama-housing-crisis-unit_n_1229617.html?1327453577\">appointed New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman </a>to head the Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group in January in his state of the union address. \"This new unit will hold accountable those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners and help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many Americans,\" Obama said.</p> <p>Late on Monday, Schneiderman announced his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/02/jpmorgan-sued-bear-stearns-mortgage\">first case would be against Bear Stearns</a>, once one of Wall Street's biggest players and now part of JP Morgan.</p> <p>According to the complaint, Bear Stearns and its lending unit, EMC Mortgage, defrauded investors who purchased mortgage securities packaged by the companies from 2005 through 2007.</p> <p>The suit argues that wrongdoing was widespread at the firm, and that Bear Stearns made material misrepresentations about the quality of the loans in the securities, ignoring warning signs of trouble ahead as they sold them to investors. The same allegations have been made in several private lawsuits brought against JP Morgan.</p> <p>John Coffee, a professor at Columbia law school, said it was a \"significant move\" but said cynics were questioning both the timing and the target. \"It's about time there was action, and this is a much broader case than we have seen so far, much broader than the risk-averse SEC [the US's top financial watchdog] would be prepared to bring,\" he said. \"But it's Bear Stearns, not JP Morgan,\" he said.</p> <p>Coffee said Schneiderman had recently been eclipsed by Benjamin Lawsky, head of the recently formed New York department of financial services. Lawsky brought a high-profile case against Standard Chartered in August over allegations of money laundering.</p> <p>The case is similar to a number of private actions that have already been brought. In a statement, JP Morgan has claimed the case was brought \"without ever offering us an opportunity to rebut the claims and without developing a full record \u2014 instead relying on recycled claims already made by private plaintiffs.\"</p> <p>Coffee said: \"They wanted to bring this case quickly. A cynic might say they wanted to bring it before the election to show they are doing something.\"</p> <p>Peter Henning, a professor of law at Wayne State University, said the case was important because it was the first broad action brought by Obama's team. \"The case says this was a pattern of behavior, not some small specific wrongdoing,\" he said.</p> <p>\"But then it's an action against a defunct firm. You aren't going to see any significant reforms here,\" he said. Henning also said he did not expect any money to back to mortgage holders. The case is likely to lead to a settlement that will be paid out to other large institutions, not individuals.</p> <p>\"If they are leading with their strongest suit, my reaction is largely a shrug of the shoulders,\" Henning said.</p> <p>Annemarie McAvoy of Fordham University, a former federal prosecutor, said this case was likely to be the \"opening salvo\" in a series of cases. \"Clearly there were a lot of problems. It hasn't been as easy for regulators to bring cases as they would have liked.\" </p> <p>\"But it wasn't JP Morgan that was responsible here,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney is throwing in the towel. Not on the presidential race, mind you. But in recent weeks, he has tacitly abandoned his strategy of making this election a simple referendum on President Barack Obama's handling of the economy.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/02/us/politics/as-economic-argument-sputters-romney-broadens-focus.html?hp&amp;_r=0\">The New York Times reports</a> that \"rather than focusing on Mr Obama, they plan to stress that voters need to make a choice between two men with different visions of the world.\" This means \"Mr Romney intends to hit the White House with a series of arguments \u2013 on energy, healthcare, taxes, spending and a more direct attack on Mr Obama's foreign policy record\", rather than focusing like a laser beam on jobs and the economy.</p> <p>In other words, Romney is now abandoning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/02/mitt-romney-conservative-pundit-roundup\">his framing of the campaign</a> in favor of Obama's. Why?</p> <p>To some extent, this is because Romney's monomaniac focus on the economy didn't work as well as Bill Clinton's in 1992. Romney's vast personal wealth and the specifics of his business background \u2013 private equity and venture capitalism \u2013 have made it more difficult for him to seem in touch with the concerns of those with financial struggles. Second, the recession and the financial meltdown both started under George W Bush, with whom Romney bears some resemblance on policy, complicating the argument that Obama is solely responsible.</p> <p>A presidential candidate also needs to have detailed policy positions on the whole range of issues facing the country, not just economics. Moreover, it would be political malpractice to ignore the president's (mis)handling of Libya. But with this caveat: a campaign needs an overarching theme.</p> <p>The biggest problem is that Romney simply did a poor job making the economic argument. He unveiled a 59-point plan that was too long and unfocused to resonate. Then, when it was distilled to five points, it was still forgettable \u2013 even if you aren't Rick Perry. The rest of the details were supposed to be filled in by his choice of running mate. But the Romney tax plan isn't exactly Paul Ryan's, and the Democrats gleefully attacked Ryan's Medicare plan.</p> <p>That was as far as the positive case for Romney as an economic problem-solver went. Even when Romney confined his critique of Obama to the economy, he was all over the place: China, taxes, monetary policy, deficits, the unemployment rate among women. He did not establish a convincing connection between troubling statistics and Obama's policies.</p> <p>More often, Romney simply assumed that the self-evidently bad economy was Obama's fault and reason enough that he should be elected. </p> <p>Yet, there remains a huge, undeniable gap between Obama's promises and his results. In some cases, he is essentially repeating the same goals this year that he failed to achieve in his first term. Some of this over-promising came wrapped in hyperbolic, almost messianic rhetoric.</p> <p>Romney should stick to pointing to the disconnect between Obama's words and deeds, contrasting \"hope and change\" with slow growth and net job losses. He must note that Obama's deficits will lead inexorably to higher taxes, even for some of the \"47%\". Don't let Obama get away with \"created or saved\" metrics or comparisons to Bush. Compare the price tag of the Obama administration with the tangible results.</p> <p>None of that is good enough if Romney fails to establish himself as a suitable alternative. Romney should turn his record at Bain, on the Olympics and as governor of Massachusetts into a complete story: he is someone with expertise in turning around financially troubled entities \u2013 and that is exactly what Washington needs right now.</p> <p>It may not be an inspiring sales pitch, but it is the one that worked in his only successful political venture. Romney didn't get elected in Massachusetts because voters identified with him, felt comfortable with his wealth or even particularly liked him. He convinced them that he could come in and manage the government's financial affairs better than the people who were currently in charge.</p> <p>It's an opening that Romney has. He can accuse the bipartisan political class in Washington of mission creep and say that they have lost focus on their fiduciary responsibility to the shareholders \u2013 in this case, the taxpayers. He can say that in the business world, a chief executive who promised much and delivered little would have to be fired. </p> <p>The Romney-Ryan ticket has made many of these arguments in the past, of course. But it has not done so in any sustained way and has not stuck with any of them long enough for them to really permeate the public consciousness.</p> <p>This one-two punch has the benefits of being as accurate as anything is in politics, while also connecting with the concerns of voters who like Obama personally but aren't satisfied with what he has done as president. The campaign is, instead, unfolding in a way that allows them to stay with the president they like over the challenger they find off-putting.</p> <p>At this late date, it's not guaranteed to work. But it is a better bet than throwing things at the wall and seeing what sticks.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hello, Mr Trump, how's New York?</strong></p> <p>It's beautiful here, beautiful!</p> <p>Great! So you're coming to London soon to talk about the secrets of your&#xa0;success <strong><a href=\"#1\">(1</a><a name=\"1back\">)</a></strong>. Can you give me some spoilers?</p> <p>I've given a lot of speeches to pass on what I've learned, and they always go down very well. My secrets are to know what you're doing, to love what you do and never quit <strong><a href=\"#2\">(2</a><a name=\"2back\">)</a></strong>. The tickets are selling great for the event. I'd be shocked if they didn't as they always do. Well, there's always a first time, ha ha ha! No, I would be shocked if they weren't&#xa0;selling.</p> <p>You've been very active politically of late <strong><a href=\"#3\">(3</a><a name=\"3back\">)</a></strong>. Do you think the Republicans are now regretting that you're not their candidate?</p> <p>I was extremely popular but I love what I do so I decided to stick with this. But a lot of people regret it, sure. I was leading in the polls <strong><a href=\"#4\">(4</a><a name=\"4back\">)</a></strong>. But I'm a friend of Mitt Romney, I think he's a very talented guy. He is a little bit behind but there's lots of time, more than a month.</p> <p><strong>You showed Sarah Palin around New York City last year. Are you still friends with her?</strong></p> <p>I am. I love her \u2013 Sarah's terrific. She should have been given a bigger place at the Republican National Convention. I don't know why she wasn't.</p> <p><strong>You were very energetic about insisting President Obama produce his birth certificate last year, which he did to your apparent satisfaction. But now you seem to be&#xa0;doubting its validity. Why?</strong></p> <p>I'm not the only one \u2013 many people are doubting it. I'm certainly not out on my own here! I was able to get him to produce it \u2013 John McCain couldn't do it, Hillary Clinton couldn't do it \u2013 but I don't know what it was he produced. Where are the hospital records? I'm amazed Governor Romney hasn't pursued him on this.</p> <p><strong>You've also expressed some doubts about the veracity of his university career. What do you want him to show&#xa0;you?</strong></p> <p>He should produce his college records, like all other presidential candidates have done <strong><a href=\"#5\">(5</a><a name=\"5back\">)</a></strong>. If I were running for president, that would be a main theme of my campaign. The Republicans should make him produce these in exchange for showing tax records. I honestly don't know why they don't insist on it.</p> <p><strong>Do you seriously think President Obama is hiding something?</strong></p> <p>Possibly, but we may never know.</p> <p><strong>You had some harsh words to say about Kate Middleton recently, tweeting that she \"has only herself to blame\" for being papped topless. </strong></p> <p>I really like Kate, I think she's terrific, but she does have only herself to blame for those photos. It doesn't matter what the lawyers do, those photos are everywhere. Everyone in New York has seen them. Kate is going to be the future Queen of England and you don't go topless if you're going to be the Queen. Is Kate more to blame than the photographer who took the pictures? Yes, I think so \u2013 there's just no excuse. If she'd had a bathing suit on that would be different. OK,&#xa0;she was at a private pool but what about the staff at the house? And there were all the hills and the road nearby \u2013 she should not have gone topless. I guarantee the Queen has never walked around topless. The&#xa0;Queen&#xa0;has never done anything wrong at all. I totally adore the royal&#xa0;family.</p> <p><strong>You've taken to Twitter very enthusiastically \u2013 how do you cope&#xa0;with the abuse?</strong></p> <p>My Twitter has more followers than the New York Times has readers. I&#xa0;have a newspaper \u2013 I literally have&#xa0;my&#xa0;own&#xa0;newspaper and it's called @iamdonaldtrump. Literally <strong><a href=\"#6\">(6</a><a name=\"6back\">)</a></strong>. Now when someone attacks me, I attack them right back. I used to have to make speeches to attack people, now I don't even have to do that. I only attack people who attack me or who are wrong \u2013 like Alex Salmond.</p> <p><strong>Alex Salmond, the First Minister of Scotland?</strong></p> <p>Mad Alex \u2013 that's what I call him \u2013 is going to destroy Scotland with those wind turbines. They are a blight and if he keeps going with these things, Scotland will be reduced to nothingness. Scotland's greatest asset aside from its people is its beautiful landscape and he is destroying the beauty. Wind turbines are ugly, inefficient and costly and taxpayers are subsidising his folly. Mad Alex has a death wish. He is trying to destroy Scotland, and England should stop subsidising the death of Scotland.</p> <p><strong>Right. Speaking of the death of Scotland, how's the golf course, Trump International Golf Links in Aberdeenshire?</strong></p> <p>It's going fantastic. I've always gotten good reviews for all my work <strong><a href=\"#7\">(7</a><a name=\"7back\">)</a></strong> but the reviews for this have been the best. It's the best thing that's happened to Aberdeen since North Shore Oil [sic].</p> <p>Everybody in Aberdeen wanted it \u2013 at our worst we had 93% approval. The press really missed that story \u2013 that people wanted the golf course. I'm going to go up there and play in a few weeks and I'll see everyone who wants to thank me.</p> <p><strong>On a more personal level, I saw photos of your New York apartment <a href=\"#8\">(8</a><a name=\"8back\">)</a> in Hello! recently. Um, wow?</strong></p> <p>My apartment is in the Trump Tower in New York and it was easier to build the building than it was the apartment. But it's great, I've had some happy feelings there. It's a very friendly apartment.</p> <p>&#xa0;<strong>And finally, how many times a day do&#xa0;you get asked about your hair?</strong></p> <p>It is my hair and it's an amazing thing.

  "<p>Mitt Romney will use Wednesday's presidential debate with Barack Obama to try to get across a clear, unequivocal message after weeks in which he has been accused of leaving voters confused by frequently chopping and changing.</p> <p>Romney, in an <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/nationalpolitics/ci_21676605/romney-wont-deport-young-illegals-who-have-temporary\">interview with the Denver Post</a> and at a late-night rally in Denver on Monday, offered a preview of his line of attack for the 90-minute debate. Central to his strategy will be to attempt to undo some of the damage caused by the secret video in which he dismissed 47% of Americans as freeloaders. </p> <p>He will list damning statistics showing the extent to which Americans have become dependent on the federal government, from food stamps to unemployment benefits.</p> <p>He will also attempt to work into the debate, even though it is supposed to be devoted exclusively to domestic policy, accusations that the White House obfuscated over the killing of US ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans in Benghazi, Libya.</p> <p>In a sign that Republicans have not yet given up on Romney with five weeks left to election day, one of the biggest of the conservative Super Pacs, American Crossroads, which is run by, among others, Bush's former adviser Karl Rove, announced Tuesday it had bought $16m in television and radio ads for a week-long blitz in the eight presidential swing states and in four Senate contests.</p> <p>If Crossroads had decided the election was now unwinnable, it would have shifted the bulk of the money to the Senate races. Instead, it is spending $11m on the presidential race and $5m on the Senate races.</p> <p>Romney's campaign team has been engaged for days over what strategy to pursue in the debate and in the weeks left to election day: whether to stick rigidly to the economy, as his main strategist Stuart Stevens advocates, or seek to exploit questions over Obama's handling of the Middle East.</p> <p>The internal debate remains unresolved, with campaign advisers briefing journalists that Romney is to adopt a scatter-gun approach in the coming weeks, tackling a range of issues across a broad spectrum. The Romney campaign has had three relaunches in as many weeks.</p> <p>In contrast with Obama, who is facing no criticism from Democrats over the way he is running his campaign, Republican politicians and conservative commentators have rounded on Romney for what they label a policy vacuum and sought to fill it with conflicting advice, ranging from offering specific policy points to switching to foreign policy.</p> <p>Ed Gillespie, one of Romney's campaign advisers, denied that the regular switches in messaging over the last few weeks reflected chaos and insisted it reflected the range of issues facing voters.</p> <p>In the Denver Post, Romney predicted that after the debate the lines between him and Obama would be clearer. \"I think what's going to happen in this debate is each of us will get the opportunity to describe our pathway forward for America. And for the last several weeks and months, the president has dramatically distorted my own views. I look forward to the debate so people will understand what I actually believe.\"</p> <p>The main line from Romney, according to his campaign advisers, will be that the last four years have been disastrous and that voters don't want another four years of the same.</p> <p>At the rally in Denver on Monday night, Romney rehearsed his response to the secret video, arguing that the 47% were dependent on federal aid because of Obama's policies. The Republican candidate ran through a series of statistics: the number of people on food stamps had risen by 15 million; one in six live in poverty; 23 million are looking for work; and for 43 straight months, unemployment has stood above 8%.</p> <p>\"The economy is not in recovery. We're not seeing a real recovery. The president's policies have not worked,\" he said.</p> <p>Conservatives hope that the election will eventually tighten and that the US media, keen to see a dramatic election finish, will jump on the slightest sign of recovery by Romney as a comeback. </p> <p>But the latest poll, from Quinnipiac University, shows no shift yet in Obama's lead, putting him at 49% to Romney's 45%. It records he has an 18% lead over Romney among women, 56% to 38%, and 94% to 2% among African Americans. Romney has a lead among men 52% to 42% while white voters back Romney 53% to 42%.</p>",
  "<p>The international community has been hand-holding Afghanistan for long enough and Kabul should now be left to get on with running the country without the west's constant interference, the British ambassador in Kabul has said.</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian, Sir Richard Stagg said it was also clear that the Taliban had grown tired of camping across the border in Pakistan and had accepted they needed to be involved in peace and reconciliation talks over the next two years if they were to have any hope of sharing power.</p> <p>The Foreign Office does not believe the complex obstacles to negotiations are insurmountable, which will give further encouragement to the voices in Whitehall pushing for an acceleration of the British military and civilian withdrawal.Stagg acknowledged that the debate about withdrawal was ongoing and hinted that he believed a faster drawdown was not only possible, but preferable:</p> <p>\"The question is: how fast do you hand over? It's not a gulf of difference. It is a spectrum and it depends on your judgment on the progress we are making. And on the security side we are making good progress.</p> <p>\"The more the people of Afghanistan see their own government stand on its own two feet, the better for everybody. This is not a matter of us cutting and running and disappearing, it is a matter of shifting the nature of our engagement from hand-holding to one which is offering support as needed and required.\"</p> <p>He added: \"We need to allow [the Afghans] to get on with things more. The international community has been a bit omnipresent in the last decade and we need to move to a different business model in which we are there to provide help and guidance but not there to try to take decisions for them.\"</p> <p>The ambassador's remarks chime with those of Nato's secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/01/nato-forces-afghanistan-early-retreat?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">who said on Monday </a>that the retreat of western forces from Afghanistan could come sooner than expected. \"If the security situation allows, I would not exclude the possibility that in certain areas you could accelerate the process,\" Rasmussen said.</p> <p>Much will depend on a report from Nato's overall commander in Afghanistan, General John Allen, which will be finished within weeks, and the result of the forthcoming US presidential election.</p> <p>The White House is not expected to make any big decisions on Afghanistan until after polling day on 6 November. If Mitt Romney wins, Nato commanders expect further delays as a new administration gets to grips with the issues. A former ambassador to India, Stagg took over from Sir William Patey in April this year. He said he had been encouraged by the capability of Afghan security forces, but added that one of his aims was to help underpin faith in the country's political system before the presidential elections in 2014.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397066663\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/2/1349196919532/British-High-Commissioner-006.jpg\" alt=\"British High Commissioner in India Sir Richard Stagg\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The British ambassador to Afghanistan, Sir Richard Stagg. Photograph: Fayaz Kabli/Reuters</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fayaz Kabli/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Stagg warned there is a danger that western countries expect too much from Afghanistan: \"We need to be sensible in our ambition. I think wWe should be careful not to expect Afghanistan, which started off from a far, far worse place than its neighbours, to leap-frog to a far more orderly or better-run society than the rest of the region.</p> <p>\"We should help to lay a foundation so that the principles of how the society might evolve are there. The challenge is to have a process by 2014 that is orderly and transparent, and that it leads to a peaceful transition to a new government. Challenge is not a codeword for impossibility. There are still 18 months to go.\"</p> <p>Stagg said the Taliban could see a new political infrastructure being created in Kabul, and had begun to realise that if it wanted to shape Afghanistan's future, it needed to be involved now, and not after the election, when it will be too late.</p> <p>\"There is going to be a process of work over the next two years to shape the future Afghan political environment, and I think the Taliban can see that it would be to their disadvantage not to be part of that process. The Taliban have been in exile for over a decade. They would very much like to be back in their own country. And they have now discovered that the Afghan army is an effective force.</p> <p>\"The sense of being able to take charge of the country \u2026 I think they realise this is now totally unrealistic. So if you are thinking that the only way forward is the potential to share power, then talking is a sensible way of achieving that outcome. We are seeing more and more signs that the Taliban are moving towards that understanding.\"</p> <p>Nato is working towards pulling out all of its combat forces by the end of 2014, although it has not set out a timetable for withdrawal. Earlier this year, Nato military commanders had argued they needed as many troops there as possible for as long as possible, but that view has changed in recent months. The number of so-called \"green on blue\" attacks, where Afghan soldiers have shot colleagues in Nato's International Security and Assistance Force, has increased sharply this year.</p> <p>With more than 50 troops killed, including five Britons, trust between the forces has been strained and calls for a substantial withdrawal of forces in 2013 have increased.</p>",

Now all Team Romney has to do is read over the array of sometimes bland, sometimes counterintuitive, and even more often contradictory right wing-approved options and decide how to implement it in the time he has left.</p> <h2>Show Us Your Plan!</h2> <p>Never mind the <a href=\"http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=9ED7EADC-E598-46B3-9EDC-8BCF2905D039\">conventional wisdom</a> until just a couple of months ago that the race was a referendum on Obama, now Romney has to <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/post/bill-kristol-calls-out-romneys-flawed-campaign-strategy/2012/09/24/27640088-0661-11e2-a10c-fa5a255a9258_blog.html\">give voters a clear choice</a>. His ultra-vague tax plan is the most popular whipping boy for this argument.</p> <p>\"He's gotta be mature and sensible and assume the American public is willing to hear some hard truths and explain his tax plan,\" <a href=\"http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/kristol-romney-cant-win-if-he-loses-tax\">Bill Kristol said last week</a>. The problem: Getting specific means telling Americans a bunch of things they really, r<a href=\"http://2012.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/08/study-romney-plan-would-raise-taxes-on-95-of-americans.php\">eally don't want to hear.</a></p> <h2>Free Paul Ryan!</h2> <p>Also on the specifics front, Paul Ryan's biggest fans are complaining that he's not given enough freedom to promote his awesome deficit reduction plan: especially the part about privatizing Medicare. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who was one of Ryan's biggest boosters during the VP selection process, has been <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/24/us/politics/conservatives-want-ryan-to-campaign-more-aggressively.html?pagewanted=all\">leading the charge</a> on this front. But he's hardly alone.</p> <p>\"Get somebody out there, and let's talk to the American people about Medicare, and they'll understand we have to do something,\" Haley Barbour <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1012/81861_Page3.html\">said on ABC</a> over the weekend. But there's little evidence Ryan's Medicare plan is a political winner and mounting evidence that it's currently a drag on the must-win senior vote.</p> <h2>Flip off the 47%!</h2> <p>Democrats are over the moon about Mitt Romney's 47% moment. But they're not nearly as giddy as conservative pundits who say Romney should double down \u2013 nay, treble down \u2013 on his leaked fundraiser video.</p> <p>\"If I'm Governor Romney I run with this all day long!\" <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2012/09/19/oreilly_romney_should_run_with_his_video_comments.html\">Bill O'Reilly said on his Fox show.</a> CNN commentator Mary Matalin expressed excitement at the possibility of finally being able to <a href=\"http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/mary-matalin-thanks-to-romney-we-can-single\">single out the \"parasites\" in our midst.</a> \"Team Romney should force this debate onto the national stage,\" <a href=\"http://www.redstate.com/2012/09/17/treat-the-press-as-enemy-collaborators/\">Erick Erickson proclaimed.</a></p> <h2>Do stuff you're already doing!</h2> <p>Hey, has Romney ever considered running on high unemployment?</p> <p>\"Mitt Romney has to get up there and say 'lower unemployment, lower median income and lowered expectations,'\" radio host Laura Ingraham <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/tv/ingraham-trashes-romney-camp-for-trailing-in-the-polls-should-be-up-by-five-six-points/\">suggested on Fox News recently.</a></p> <p>Meghan McCain <a href=\"http://video.msnbc.msn.com/politicsnation/49248652/#49248652\">expressed similar frustration </a>on MSNBC on Monday, saying if she were Romney she'd talk about the fact \"that our unemployment is over 8%, that the deficit is over 16% [sic]. Those are the types of things I would start zeroing in on.\"</p> <h2>Go big (on whatever topic I specialize in)!</h2> <p>Charles Krauthammer, a leading hawk, thinks that Romney should turn his campaign around by running on <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/charles-krauthammer-go-large-mitt/2012/09/27/d4c292be-08c6-11e2-afff-d6c7f20a83bf_story.html\">tough Middle East foreign policy</a>. As for social conservative activist and commentator Bryan Fischer, Romney would be winning handily if he just was running on <a href=\"http://2012.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/09/bryan-fischer-todays-gop-will-be-dead-if-romney-loses.php\">banning gay marriage.</a> Centrist columnist David Brooks thinks Romney should renege on all his campaign promises at the debate and embrace Brooks' centrist plan <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/02/opinion/brooks-the-opening-statement.html?_r=1&amp;smid=tw-nytdavidbrooks&amp;seid=auto\">to raise taxes</a>.</p> <h2>Get warm and fuzzy!</h2> <p>Romney's got an image problem?

Strategist Alex Castellanos said he should hang out at an <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/27/opinion/castellanos-romney-rallies/index.html\">unemployment line.</a></p> <h2>Never mind, be a rich guy!</h2> <p>Or you can just let Romney be Romney. Say, by embracing his millionaire brand, as <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2012/08/22/kevin_d_williamson_national_review_evolutionary_speaking_romney_should_get_100_percent_of_the_female_vote_.html\">several</a> <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/mitt-romney-prevail-article-1.1165099?localLinksEnabled=false\">conservative</a> <a href=\"http://radioviceonline.com/joe-scarborough-rants-for-romney-embrace-your-wealth-and-success/\">pundits</a> have suggested.</p> <p>\"When it comes to being a rich guy, Mitt Romney should own it,\" National Review columnist Kevin Williamson wrote.</p> <h2>Be more Reagan!</h2> <p>Whatever the advice, there's always a Reagan angle.

We've even practised the <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/21/giuliani-excuse-me-while-i-take-this-call/\">Giuliani Escape Hatch</a>, whereby you hilariously pretend to take a phone call from your wife. And now, if I could give you only one word of advice, it would be this: relax. Don't think about the fact that Wednesday is unequivocally the most important night of your entire career \u2013 definitely don't think about that! Just slip into your jeans, crack open a cold one (caffeine-free Coke) and self-deport to your happy place. In Denver, I want to see the graceful, easeful, flowing Mitt. The Mitt who floats like a butterfly. Mitt the <em>dancer</em>. I know he exists \u2013 I've seen him.</p> <p>S </p> <p>===</p> <p><strong>To:</strong> Mitt Romney<br><strong>From:</strong> Stuart Stevens, Chief Campaign Strategist<br><strong>Subject:</strong> Re: Eve-of-debate final thoughts</p> <p>Actually, on second thoughts I was thinking of Rafalca.

No zinger six.

According to Nobiaspolling.blogspot.com, you've pulled eight points ahead of Obama in key swing states! EIGHT POINTS! This differs a bit from our internal polling, but apparently these guys are using a cutting-edge psephological technique that involves defining Louisiana and North Dakota as \"key swing states\".

Also, you have to be spontaneous, but based entirely on pre-memorised phrases. In short: you need to be a genial attack dog. Like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitt_Romney_dog_incident\">Seamus</a>, of blessed memory, except simultaneously more vicious and more lovable. And if anyone's got the \"people skills\" to pull that off, it's you<br> S</p> <p>PS. Visualisation tip, based on a book I've been reading about public speaking: imagine that your whole audience is plutocrats at a fundraiser (so you feel comfortable) \u2013 but plutocrats who've just lost millions of dollars as a result of a failed private-equity deal (so you show empathy).

Can't fault us on that. I mean, I'm not giving up or anything \u2013 we can still win this thing, yadda, yadda, yadda \u2013 but what a wild ride that was, huh? Crazy. Running for president. Us!

I have to keep my answers short, and when Romney starts talking and talking \u2026 I should let him. Oh, and I need to \"avoid being condescending\".

  "<p>A judge in Pennsylvania has put on hold a key provision of the state's contested voter ID law that required all voters to show an authorised photocard before they could cast their ballot in November's presidential election.</p> <p>Judge Robert Simpson of the Pennsylvania commonwealth court allowed most of the state's new voter ID law \u2013 one of the toughest in the country \u2013 to stand. But he put on hold a provision that would have required anyone unable to produce photo ID to file a preliminary vote and then validate their ballot within six days of the vote by producing the card.</p> <p>The judge's <a href=\"http://media.philly.com/documents/CMWSuppDetAppPrelInjOrder_100212.pdf \">preliminary injunction</a> on the photo card requirement will last only for the 2012 presidential election. Simpson said he had decided to impose it because \"I am not still convinced that there will be no voter disenfranchisement arising out of the commonwealth's implementation of a voter identification requirement for purposes of the upcoming election\".</p> <p>The ruling is subject to a possible appeal by the state to the Pennsylvania supreme court.</p> <p>Advocates for voting rights hailed the judgement as a victory for their cause. Wendy Weiser, an expert on the subject at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU school of law, said the ruling would help to keep US elections free, fair and accessible to all. \"Implementing a sweeping new voter ID law so close to an election would prevent eligible citizens from voting and having their say in our democracy. We are pleased the court refused to allow politicians to manipulate the system for their own benefit by rushing through new voting requirements that would keep out legitimate voters.\"</p> <p>The Pennsylvania voter ID law was one of the most egregious examples of a spate of hardline legislation that has swept the country. Since January 2011, 19 states have <a href=\"http://www.brennancenter.org/content/resource/2012_summary_of_voting_law_changes/\">passed a total of 24 laws</a> that erect new hurdles to voting, the most common of which is a requirement to show photo ID cards.</p> <p>Proponents of the laws have insisted they are necessary to combat fraudulent ballots. But in practice, proven examples of fraud at the ballot box are fleetingly rare, and civil rights groups such as the NAACP and the American Civil Liberties Union have argued the measures disenfranchise vulnerable communities such as ethnic minorities, older people, disabled people and the young.</p> <p>The Pennsylvania legislation caused extra consternation earlier this year when Mike Turzai, leader of the Republicans in the Pennsylvania assembly, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuOT1bRYdK8\">said at a rally of party members</a>: \"Voter ID, which is going to allow governor Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania. Done.\"</p> <p>The law also caused alarm after Pennsylvania election officials released figures that suggested that <a href=\" http://articles.philly.com/2012-07-05/news/32537732_1_voter-id-new-voter-id-cards\">some 758,000 registered voters did not have valid photo cards</a> \u2013 suggesting up to 9% of the electorate could be disenfranchised. In his deliberations, Simpson rejected the 9% figure as inflated, but he also found that the state's claim that just 1% of voters were without valid identification was an underestimate.</p> <p>The battle over Pennsylvania's voter ID law has been so fierce in part because of the state's rich crop of electoral college votes \u2013 it holds 20 of the 270 votes needed to win the presidency. In 2008, Obama won the state with 54% of the vote to John McCain's 44%.</p> <p>This year most polls are putting Obama again comfortably in the lead in Pennsylvania. The <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/pa/pennsylvania_romney_vs_obama-1891.html \">Real Clear Politics tracker poll </a>has the president eight points head on 50% to Mitt Romney's 42%.</p>",

His speech marks the long-awaited rebirth of a radical social democracy in this country. We can now start hoping once again. In particular, working-class people can feel that the party is back on their side.</p> <p>He drew a line under most of the blunders and misconceptions of the new Labour years. His \"one nation\" is not the triangulated, all-things-to-all-people message associated with Tony Blair. Instead he targeted the banks and Murdoch without poking at working people's unions. The country has been waiting to hear that from a political leader since 2008 at least.</p> <p>Miliband's promise is to restore our country to its people. Decent homes and services; fairness before favours for the rich and powerful; our NHS back where it belongs, in public hands \u2013 these will make us thrive again.</p> <p>Labour must speak for the public against the rampage of private interests. Speak for the people whose talents are wasted and aspirations destroyed. Shake up our banks and take back our NHS. And yes, put the burden on those with the broadest shoulders. That is the agenda set out today.</p> <p>A faint heart never won a fair election. Miiband has shown he's more than ready to do battle in 2015. This is a shot in the arm for the labour movement.</p> <p>\u2022 Len McCluskey is general secretary of Unite the Union</p> <h2>Gavin Kelly: 'Channelling the spirit of post-Olympic Britain'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397054500\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/9/1347204360790/Gavin_Kelly.jpg\" alt=\"Gavin Kelly\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>A good speech always faces a number of hurdles. It needs to start from the national mood and build from there \u2013 and this one did just that. It channelled the spirit of post-Olympic, pre-independence referendum Britain \u2013 speaking directly to a divided country that laughs darkly at the idea that \"we're all in together\", but hasn't quite given up on the idea that things could be different.</p> <p>It also needs to answer the questions hanging over it. Would Ed Miliband have the gravitas to fill the stage? Could he make an argument about future direction rather than a diagnosis of the past? And could he speak in an easy vernacular rather than abstract nouns. Crucially, could he reach outside the hall and appeal to a sceptical public? On all these tests he clearly succeeded.</p> <p>Some questions were left unresolved. Those who want Labour to say more about how it would govern through austerity will feel that there wasn't much new. And those looking for realms of policy were always going to be disappointed \u2013 this was only the first, not final, stage in seeking a mandate for the policy change \u2013 from reforming the banks to the education system \u2013 that would define a Miliband premiership. More will have to come \u2013 but that's for another day. Last year's speech took several months to mature. This one worked in real time.</p> <p>\u2022 Gavin Kelly is chief executive of Resolution Foundation</p> <h2>Kate Pickett: 'Miliband looks like he can lead with conviction'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397054501\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/11/15/1321358877146/kate_pickett.jpg\" alt=\"Kate Pickett\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>As income inequality has risen in Britain, social mobility has stalled and we waste the talents of far too many of our young people. Ed Miliband's speech reminded us of the \"forgotten 50%\", those who don't go to university, who aren't set on an elite trajectory from childhood. Contrast this with Mitt Romney's recent <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/18/mitt-romney-47-unsuitable-president\" title=\"\">derision of the 47%</a> of Americans who don't earn enough to pay tax \u2013 it tells you all you need to know about the difference between left and right politics.</p> <p>Miliband is right to stress the benefits of a comprehensive education \u2013 a cohesive society depends on us all being \"in this together\": able to understand and respect the different contributions we can all make in a fair society with a balanced economy. A vocational baccalaureate is very welcome \u2013 we need to value vocational skills much more than we do. We need people who can build a house or programme a computer more than those who know what the English is for Magna Carta.</p> <p>I think Miliband understands that politics needs to break free from the stranglehold of the top 10% (and too often it's actually only the top 1% who count). More education cannot by itself solve poverty and inequality, a point made forcefully by John Marsh in his book <a href=\"http://www.counterfire.org/index.php/articles/book-reviews/15094-class-dismissed-why-we-cannot-teach-or-learn-our-way-out-of-inequality\" title=\"\">Class Dismissed</a>. We need a living wage, stronger unions and more progressive taxes.</p> <p>One lesson from the economic crisis is that those who command the highest salaries and bonuses can't be relied upon to be either clever or good. I learned enough Shakespeare at my comprehensive school to know that \"<a href=\"http://www.shakespeare-online.com/sonnets/94.html\" title=\"\">lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds</a>\". Labour needs to tackle head-on the ways in which the most privileged act to protect their own entrenched advantage and Miliband is looking like he can lead the way with courage and conviction.</p> <p>\u2022 Kate Pickett is the co-author of The Spirit Level: Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better</p> <h2>Tim Montgomerie: 'Reminiscent of early Tony Blair'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397054502\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/8/18/1313679712567/Tim-Montgomerie-003.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Montgomerie\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Montgomerie</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After today we know that Ed Miliband can deliver a speech without notes and with passion. David Cameron will testify to the fact that that counts. He largely won the Tory leadership on the back of a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2005/oct/04/conservatives2005.conservatives3\" title=\"\">similarly delivered speech</a> at the Tory conference of 2005.</p> <p>But I was most reminded of early Tony Blair rather than early Cameron. Blair was at his best when he raided deep into Conservative territory. By repeatedly deploying the timeless Tory ideal of \"one nation\" that was what today's Labour leader was also trying to do. Stood on a stage that was deliberately bathed in blue, Miliband mounted a strong defence of the union with Scotland and paid big tributes to the armed forces. We know that Labour is the party of the state. Today, the Labour leader was also trying to say that his was also the party of the whole country.</p> <p>The job-creating private sector won't believe that claim until Miliband faces up to the problem of public sector workers enjoying higher average wages, better pensions and shorter working hours. The government of which Miliband was a leading member piled on taxes and debt. It created enormous new divisions. New divisions between the overtaxed private sector and the over-indulged public sector. And divisions between today's subsidised generation and tomorrow's workers who will have to repay that overspending. Miliband talked big about one nation but he still lacks any plan to address the divisions he helped to create.</p> <p>\u2022 Tim Montgomerie is the editor of ConservativeHome.com</p> <h2>Patrick Diamond: 'A speech of authenticity and raw emotion'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397054503\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/2/1349193248133/diamond.jpg\" alt=\"Patrick Diamond\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This was a spectacular performance, remarkable for the cogency and fluidity of delivery. Its real strength was authenticity and the raw, at times poignant, emotion. It is clear Ed Miliband's mission is not just restoring confidence in the Labour party, but also revitalising faith in politics. The speech showed an astute sense of strategic positioning, laying claim to the centre-ground and stealing the mantle of Disraeli's \"One Nation\", which the Labour leader claimed David Cameron's Conservatives have betrayed. What marks out the speech from the Blair and Brown era is that rather than taking the centre as given, Miliband wants to shift the gravity of British politics in a progressive direction, tackling inequality and the gap between rich and poor, while forging a more \"responsible\" British capitalism. The claim that New Labour was too timid about the accountability of \"the power structure\" in Britain rings true in the wake of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/sep/25/phone-hacking-claims-news-international\" title=\"\">News International</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/sep/28/libor-government-urged-implement-reforms\" title=\"\">Libor</a>.</p> <p>The speech sets a direction of travel. Now, the aim will be to put flesh on the bones of what a Labour government would do in an era of austerity. Banking reform, a long-term culture of investment in British business, overhauling vocational education and training \u2013 these are laudable ambitions, but they have eluded all post-war governments. Difficult decisions await the party about how Labour will address long-term challenges, from social care reform to building a Nordic system of universal childcare. What will be required is a clear sense of governing strategy, and a willingness to engage voters in an honest conversation about the tough choices that lie ahead.</p> <p>\u2022 Patrick Diamond is a former policy adviser to Tony Blair</p>",

  "<p>Mitt Romney has softened his position on immigration, promising for the first time to honour changes introduced in the summmer by Barack Obama that offer temporary visas to undocumented young people brought into the US by their parents.</p> <p>In an interview with the Denver Post before the first presidential debate in Colorado on Wednesday, he pledged that he would not revoke Obama's executive order and that undocumented young people who were brought to the US before their 16th birthday will not be deported.</p> <p>Romney has avoided answering the question of what he would do with Obama's order if he won the election, saying only that the issue had to be addressed by long-term reforms. His shift, on the eve of the debate and five weeks before the White House election, is aimed at cutting into Obama's commanding lead among Latino voters, who, though a minority, could tip the balance in some swing states.</p> <p>Romney told the paper: \"The people who have received the special visa that the president has put in place, which is a two-year visa, should expect that the visa would continue to be valid.\"</p> <p>He added: \"I'm not going to take something that they've purchased. Before those visas have expired we will have the full immigration reform plan that I've proposed.\"</p> <p>His change came the day before the first presidential debate, being held in Denver, and five weeks before the White House election.</p> <p>Romney took a hard line on illegal immigration during the Republican primaries and caucuses, saying he would pursue tough policies that would lead to \"self-deportation\". But he now faces electoral arithmetic that shows Latinos backing Obama by at least two to one \u2013 and that could make a difference in swing states such as Colorado, Nevada, Virginia and Florida.</p> <p>When Obama introduced the change in June with an order that bypassed Congress, Romney criticised the president for failing to go through the legislature. Faced with questions at the time about what he would do about the visas if he won the election, Romney opted for ambiguity, saying the order would be \"superseded\" by what he said would a comprehensive immigration reform package.</p> <p>There are an estimated 11 million or more undocumented migrants in the US, making immigration an emotive issue. Some diehard Republicans favour deporting those immigrants without papers, but Democrats, and some moderate Republicans, argue this is impractical and needs a more humane approach.</p> <p>Obama won the support of Latinos in the 2008 election, but disillusionment crept in with his failure to deliver on immigration reform combined with a continuing high number of deportations.</p> <p>In an interview last month with Spanish-language network Univision, he described the lack of immigration reform as the biggest failure of his first term. His order lifting the threat to undocumented children rallied Latinos behind him again.</p> <p>Romney and some of the other Republican presidential candidates alienated many Latinos during the primaries and caucuses with their anti-immigrant rhetoric. Only Newt Gingrich and Rick Perry took a different line. </p> <p>Since becoming the Republican presidential nominee, Romney has tentatively tried to woo Latinos, with a series of Spanish political broadcasts and appearances on Spanish-language TV stations.</p> <p>Romney had been working on an immigration reform plan with the Florida senator Marco Rubio, but abandoned it when Obama announced his order.</p> <p>In the Post interview, Romney said he would introduce immigration reform in his first year in office but did not go into specifics.</p> <p>\"I will propose a piece of legislation which will reform our immigration system to improve legal immigration so people don't have to hire lawyers to figure out how to get here legally,\" Romney said. \"The president promised in his first year \u2013 his highest priority\u2013 that he would reform immigration, and he didn't. And I will.\"</p> <p>As well as voting for the president in November, Colorado will also vote on whether to legalise marijuana, allowing people to possess small amounts for recreational purposes, the first state in the US to allow this. At present, it is available over the counter in the state for medicinal uses.</p> <p>The change is backed by some Republicans as well as Democrats.</p> <p>A recent poll showed 51% in favour of the change in law but Romney expressed his opposition.</p> <p>\"I oppose marijuana being used for recreational purposes and I believe the federal law should prohibit the recreational use of marijuana,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Even by its own turbulent standards, Georgia looks to be entering a prolonged period of political instability following watershed parliamentary elections won by the opposition Georgian Dream coalition \u2013 the first time since independence in 1991 that power has been transferred through an election rather than a revolution.</p> <p>Despite <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/02/georgia-president-saakashvili-election-defeat\" title=\"\">President Mikheil Saakashvili's unexpectedly gracious admission today</a> that his ruling United National Movement had been defeated fair and square, his victorious opponents may face serious problems working with a man they have spent months vilifying and decrying as a dictator. Saakashvili is not due to stand down until October next year, and is unlikely to accept lame duck status without a fight.</p> <p>Who rules Georgia, a pint-sized Caucasus nation of 4.5 million people, matters disproportionately to both Russia, its former colonial master that involuntarily relinquished control in 1991, and the US and Europe. Georgia has a strategic importance that belies its size \u2013 a crossroads at Asia's gate with signposts pointing to Iran, Turkey, Russia and west and north across the Black Sea.</p> <p>For energy-poor western Europe, Georgia is a vital conduit for Caspian basin oil and gas exports that are not, for now at least, under Moscow's manipulative control. Vladimir Putin's Kremlin views Georgia very much as part of its backyard, a \"near abroad\" property (though the phrase is not much used these days) that should conform to Russian interests. Europe believes it belongs inside its post-Soviet, liberal pro-market \"eastern neighbourhood\".</p> <p>The idea Georgia might one day join Nato \u2013 it already contributes through the Partnership for Peace scheme \u2013 and the EU is anathema to Russian nationalists. It is not coincidental that since 2008, when Putin sent his tanks deep into Georgian territory in support of independence for the breakaway satraps of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, Russia has effectively controlled about one-fifth of Georgia's total land mass.</p> <p>The problem for both sides of this strategic equation is that Georgia's leaders \u2013 they might better be termed overlords \u2013 tend not to do what they are told, even by putative friends. Saakashvili's authoritarian, sometimes confrontational style, pockmarked by serial rights abuses including a recent prison torture scandal, has embarrassed his Brussels backers. The west wants a stable Georgian government, not one engaged in a personalised, potentially dangerous feud with the Putin regime.</p> <p>Yet the man behind the Georgian Dream opposition, billionaire <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/01/bidzina-ivanishvili-profile-georgia\" title=\"\">Bidzina Ivanishvili</a>, could also prove an awkward customer, should he be confirmed as prime minister. Ivanishvili made his money, lots and lots of it, during Russia's corrupt oligarch era. He still reportedly holds a chunk of Gazprom shares. Saakashvili predictably labelled him a Kremlin stooge, a charge he denies.</p> <p>While Putin will undoubtedly be hugely gratified to see his sworn enemy Saakashvili taken down a peg or two, he cannot be sure the mercurial Ivanishvili, who until recently led the anonymous life of a Citizen Kane-style recluse in his large luxury home overlooking Tbilisi, will do his bidding. Cloning Ukraine's pro-Kremlin president, Viktor Yanukovych, would be too good to be true for the Kremlin's karate king. That Georgians have swapped one Saakashvili for another is a more plausible possibility.</p> <p>Commentator Thomas de Waal casts the elections as a <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/09/26/georgia_holds_its_breath\" title=\"\">clash of titans</a>, neither of whom placed a more perfect democracy at the top of their to-do list:</p> <blockquote> \"Greek scholar Ilia Roubanis has called Georgian politics 'pluralistic feudalism', a competition between a patriarchal leader who enjoys uncontested rule over the country and a leader of the opposition bidding to unseat him and acquire the same [...] <br> \"Saakashvili has been personally leading the election campaign for the governing party [...] even though he is not running for parliament himself. His main message is that, like the medieval Georgian king, David the Builder, he has been building a new nation and he and his team deserve to be allowed to finish the job.\" </blockquote> <p>.</p> <p>Ivanishvili's parliamentary victory has punctured that vision, potentially fatally. But <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/10/01/georgias_electoral_showdown?page=0,0\" title=\"\">as James Kirchick of the New Republic pointed out</a>, his leadership credentials remain untested, his policy programme is both grandiose and vague on particulars, and President Saakashvili remains a formidable and powerful rival. With the loosely bound, six-party Georgian Dream coalition subject to potential splits and parliamentary defections, and the country entering wholly new territory, Georgia's political outlook, never calm, looks more stormy than ever.</p>",
  "<p>For a while last week it felt like half of Europe was on its feet in protest. In France, where President Hollande unveiled the nation's harshest budget for 30 years (including his much-anticipated \"supertax\" on the rich), demonstrators demanded a referendum on European fiscal discipline. In Greece, a general strike paralysed the country and some 200,000 people marched on parliament. Even the mild-mannered Portuguese seem to have had their fill of austerity, taking to the streets of Lisbon in their tens of thousands.</p> <p>But it was in Spain where the consequences of the financial crisis suddenly felt most urgent. A new austerity budget announced for next year, unemployment rising past 4.7 million, a \u20ac59.3bn ($76.5bn) shortfall in the banking sector and confrontation between Madrid and the regional Catalan government. To top it all, flash flooding caused deaths and extensive damage in the south of the country. As Spain's social, political and cultural fabric struggles to absorb the strain, our cover story this week asks the question: just how much more pain can the country take?</p> <p>In our Comment pages, meanwhile, the economist Ha-Joon Chang argues that the root causes of resentment are not austerity politics per se, but the politicians who are using it to rewrite our social contracts via the back door. It's a thought-provoking piece and I recommend you seek it out.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Venezuela's colourful president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez is no stranger to the Guardian Weekly's news pages. But as he attempts to convert a narrow opinion poll lead into another election victory this weekend, we consider whether his centre-right challenger Henrique Capriles can pull off a stunning shock.</p> <p>The presidential race is also warming up nicely in the US, where the first televised debates between President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger Mitt Romney begin this week. We bring you news from both campaign trails.</p> <p>In Bolivia we venture into the crumbling silver mines of Potos\u00ed, where miners still risk their lives on a daily basis and where intrepid tourists can witness the appallingly hot, cramped conditions for themselves.</p> <p>From the Middle East, Guardian correspondent <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/harrietsherwood\" title=\"\">Harriet Sherwood</a> has met some of the children who have witnessed the horrors of Syria's civil war and escaped to tell the tale. It's a harrowing reminder of the brutal atrocities being committed every day in this deeply entrenched conflict. We also report from Afghanistan, where the police force is seeing a surprising rise in the number of women enrolling for active service.</p> <p>From west Africa our sister publication Le Monde has the fascinating story of the illegal offshore petrol trade between Nigeria, where fuel prices are subsidised, and its neighbours, where they are not. From Lagos we report on the increasingly formal use of Pidgin around the country, and from Mali we examine the government's efforts to gain international support for an offensive against the Islamic rebels controlling the north of the country.</p> <p>Ever taken a tablet and wondered if it is really making you feel better? In our Review section, Ben Goldacre takes a look at how shockingly easily it is for big pharmaceutical manufacturers to manipulate clinical trial data.</p> <p>In Seoul, meanwhile, manipulation of a very different sort is reckoned to be behind a North Korean defector's sudden and unexpected decision to return to Pyongyang.

  "<p>Well! This is <em>quite</em> an exciting week in US politics. It's been a long slog but the conclusion has been reached, with all the narratives of the past few months \u2013 years, really \u2013 dovetailing into one beautiful and inevitable conclusion, one that all US citizens can gaze upon and sigh, \"Ah, yes: this, yes this, is America.\" I am speaking, of course, of the supremely American <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/lindsay-lohan-assaulted-manhattan-hotel-room-tells-cops-man-met-club-choked-report-article-1.1171479#ixzz27ziSa5eG\" title=\"\">news story</a> that broke on Sunday in which Lindsay Lohan \u2013 for it was she \u2013 allegedly got into a fight in a cheesy New York hotel with a 25-year-old Republican congressional aide called Christian LaBella. Politics and Lohan: ahhhh, you meet at last.</p> <p>This alleged event happened allegedly at the end of a long alleged night of what we Americans call \"partying\". Lohan allegedly realised LaBella had allegedly taken photos of her allegedly engaged in the aforementioned alleged partying, and words and possibly more were exchanged. And you know this LaBella dude must be cool because not only did he allegedly party with Lohan but his Facebook photo shows him grinning next to that ultimate homeboy, VP candidate Paul Ryan. The Republicans, Lohan, a cellphone, a hotel scrap at 6am: this is the natural crescendo to the modern American story. The peak has been reached; prepare for the bends as we plummet downwards.</p> <p>And speaking of plummeting ever downwards, it's the first presidential debate tomorrow night. Which is yet another big event in US politics this week. Oh ambassador, with all of this political excitement you are spoiling us. We can all only cross our fingers that Lohan will make a guest appearance in this one, too, and, really, that isn't beyond the realms of possibility.</p> <p>Yet more usually, the debates \u2013 and yes, there is more than one of them \u2013 can get a little, um, what's the word? It's on the very tip \u2026 that's it: boring. Indeed, being boring was pretty much Obama's strategy last time round, which is why not even the Washington Post \u2013 a publication so wonky it excitedly describes this week's debate as <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/what-to-expect-in-wednesdays-first-presidential-debate/2012/09/30/25562912-0b05-11e2-bd1a-b868e65d57eb_story.html\" title=\"\">\"a cultural event\"</a> \u2013 can remember a single \"genuinely memorable\" moment from the 2008 debates with John McCain due to Obama's attack plan of being \"serious and sober\" and \"milking the clock\". This is Washington Post speak for \"being boring\". Obama's own team have said they are preparing him to be \"workmanlike\". Again, read \"boring, and don't set your Sky+ to record\".</p> <p>Mitt Romney might provide some comedy, albeit wholly unintentionally. News that he has been in a concrete bunker for the past few days being reprogrammed for the debate dismayed those who find his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBu-NnAxu80\" title=\"\"><em>pied dans la bouche</em></a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHaMqHh5NZ4\" title=\"\">moments</a> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/sep/19/obama-ad-romney-47-video\" title=\"\">the only things</a> that make this election bearable. But then, great news! His team, for reasons known only to them, informed the New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/29/us/politics/cramming-and-pruning-for-first-presidential-debate.html\" title=\"\">that they have prepared some \"zingers\" for their candidate</a>, which he has been practising \"since August\". Spontaneous rib ticklers! Which Romney has been reciting to himself since August! I think the world will knock itself off its own axis through the violence of our collective guffaws.</p> <p>So how to make these events even more fun? Welcome to the bluffer's guide (with added games).</p> <p><strong>How to talk about the debates beforehand</strong></p> <p>Easy! Simply say any of the following sentences in any order you fancy: \"The debates don't matter\"; \"Let's not forget the seminal Kennedy v Nixon debate in 1960\"; \"Reagan v Mondale debate in 1984\"; \"Gore v Bush in 2000\"; \"Kerry beat Bush in the debates in 2004, remember\"; \"Romney needs to land a zinger of the 'senator, you are no Jack Kennedy' ilk, like Bentsen said to Quayle in 1988, but then, unlike Bentsen, um, win\"; \"Obama is an orator not a debater\"; \"Romney is no good on the attack\"; \"They're both impatient\"; \"It's all scripted, you know\"; \"Of course I'm staying up to watch\".</p> <p><strong>How to talk about them afterwards</strong></p> <p>\"He only needed to survive\"; \"You could tell they practised\"; \"They practised?\"; \"Where were the zingers?\"; \"It's the VP debates next week that will be <em>really</em> fun\"; \"This was just domestic diplomacy \u2013 it's the foreign diplomacy debate that will be <em>really</em> interesting\"; \"It's just entertainment\"; \"The questions were terrible\"; \"God, that was boring\".</p> <p><strong>Drinking game!</strong></p> <p>Every time Obama or Romney says any of the following, knock back a shot. You'll be drunk by the end of the crucial first half hour, which will make the remaining hour a bit more enjoyable:</p> <p>\"Let me be clear about this.\"</p> <p>\"The figures just don't add up.\"</p> <p>\"That's just plain wrong.\"</p> <p>\"The American people deserve better.\"</p> <p>\"The American people are smart enough to see&#xa0;through that.\"</p> <p>\"The American people have suffered.\"</p> <p>\"Folks.\"</p> <p>\"I love this country.\"</p> <p>\"My wife/my family/my mother.\"</p> <p><strong>Bonus drink!!!!</strong></p> <p>\"President George W Bush\" \u2013 if Romney says this name, for the Republican party the equivalent of the Scottish play, you may drink a whole magnum to celebrate. But he probably won't, so no need to stock up on the champers.</p>",
  "<p>Georgia is on the edge of a new, uncertain political era after president Mikhail Saakashvili conceded defeat in parliamentary elections, and said the opposition billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili would form a new government.</p> <p>In a TV address on Tuesday Saakashvili said his ruling United National Movement (UNM) had lost to Ivanishvili's Georgian Dream coalition. He urged Georgians to respect the result. \"We believe that their views are extremely wrong. But democracy works in a way that Georgian people make decisions by majority,\" he said.</p> <p>The election marks an extraordinary moment in Georgia's post-Soviet history, with power transferred for the first time democratically and thus-far peacefully between rival political forces.</p> <p>It is also a blow to the mercurial Saakashvili, who led the country's pro-western rose revolution in 2003. He has been an outsize, polarising figure ever since, at home and abroad.</p> <p>The man who defeated him is a 56-year-old billionaire with a stupendous private fortune, a large modern art collection and a zoo including penguins and a zebra. Ivanishvili entered politics just a year ago, turning a disunited opposition into a formidable electoral coalition. His democratic credentials are unproven.</p> <p>In a press conference on Tuesday Ivanishvili said Saakashvili should now resign. This is unlikely. Instead, Georgia is entering a potentially volatile political period. The new parliament is set to nominate Ivanishvili as prime minister. Saakashvili has to approve the nomination and could, theoretically, reject it, triggering a constitutional crisis.</p> <p>But Rapha\u00ebl Glucksmann, a senior presidential adviser, said on Tuesday that Saakashvili would not seek to thwart Ivanishvili.</p> <p>\"Saakashvili is very disappointed [with the result]. But one thing he is certain about is that leaders don't cheat in elections, and don't govern against the popular will,\" he told the Guardian, adding that the \"political dynamics\" were with the opposition.</p> <p>The big political question is whether Saakashvili and Ivanishvili can co-operate, in the wake of an election campaign characterised by mutual vitriol. The early signs of co-operation were not encouraging. Ivanishvili called Saakashvili's widely praised reforms a joke, and said his rule was \"based on lies\". Government sources dismiss Ivanishvili as a Russian stooge.</p> <p>Under Georgia's constitution the president will carry on until the end of his term next October. After that Georgia shifts from a presidential to a parliamentary system. Over the next 12 months Saakashvili and Ivanishvilithe two men will have to work closely together, and consult on foreign policy and the budget.</p> <p>Ghia Nodia, a former education minister who now runs a Tbilisi thinktank, said: \"You have Saakashvili's emotionality and Ivanishvili's bizarre character. But it's in both their interests to co-operate.</p> <p>\"If Ivanishvili accepts this power-sharing arrangement, he will see it as a transitory stage towards acquiring full power,\" he said.</p> <p>Nodia said the president deserved credit for allowing the democratic process to take its course: \"Whatever happens next, Saakashvili has vindicated himself to an extent. He is not a perfect democrat. But he is more democrat than autocrat. In autocracies, oppositions can't win elections.\"Some feared Ivanishvili might be tempted to emulate Ukraine's president Viktor Yanukovych and mete out judicial punishment to his defeated political enemies. \"The deep divisions in the country are slightly threatening. I sense vengeance, not just among people in the street but among [Georgian Dream] politicians who will be in the new parliament,\" Nodia said. Ivanishvili, however, said that government officials would not be prosecuted unless they had broken the law.</p> <p>Another unanswered question is Ivanishvili's policy towards Russia. The tycoon's international priorities are similar to Saakashvili's, and include European integration and Nato. But he has also pledged to improve relations with Vladimir Putin's Russia. Ivanishvili said he would try to convince Russia that Georgia's strategic aspirations were not a threat.</p> <p>Russia welcomed the result, saying ties that had been frozen in the wake of the 2008 Russian-Georgia war could be renewed.</p> <p>\"We are definitely looking forward for a fresh, new non-hostile, sober leadership in Georgia,\" said Dmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesman.</p> <p>A new leadership would be \"very good, very positive for us\", he continued. \"If they have more political wisdom under a new leadership, then lots and lots of new roads can be opened for the country.\" Russia cut ties with Georgia in the wake of the 2008 war over South Ossetia.</p> <p>Putin and Dmitry Medvedev, the current prime minister who was president at the time of the war, have refused to speak to Saakashvili. Ivanishvili has raised the prospect that some of Georgia's key exports \u2013 such as wine and mineral water \u2013 banned by Moscow in 2006 could now resume.</p> <p>Relations are expected to improve under Ivanishvili, who made his fortune in Russia in the 1990s. Peskov said the Kremlin had had no contact with Ivanishvili in the run-up to the vote. \"We don't know him,\" he said. \"We'll continue to watch very closely the preliminary results in Georgia, where the people are not in favour of the acting authorities so they should be changed.\"</p> <p>Georgian government sources, meanwhile, said they had not been expecting to lose Monday's election. Opinion polls had put Saakashvili's party in front.</p> <p>They conceded that a video broadcast on 19 September showing prison officers beating and raping inmates with broom handles had turned public opinion against the authorities. Voters in the Georgian Orthodox church \u2013 unhappy with the government's socially liberal policies \u2013 had also supported the opposition in huge numbers, they said.</p> <p>Official figures have yet to be confirmed but government sources said the coalition would have 84 parliamentary seats and the UNM 66. Ivanishvili's six-party coalition appears to have won about 51% of the popular vote, with 41% for UNM and 9% for other parties.</p> <p>Thousands of Georgian Dream supporters gathered on Monday night, celebrating in the capital Tbilisi and flooding Freedom Square. They included several nuns in black habits, waving blue Ivanishvili flags.</p> <p>\"The reality is that the majority of people in this country support Ivanishvili,\" Tarel Peradze, an engineer, said. He added: \"The problem is that Saakashvili didn't do dialogue. He only did monologue.\"</p>",
  "<p>Does anyone know how truly evil <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/05/new-right-ayn-rand-marx\" title=\"\">Ayn Rand </a>was? I once tried, a long time ago, to get through <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/17/ayn-rand-atlast-shrugged-paean-american-liberty\" title=\"\"><em>Atlas Shrugged</em></a>, but gave up pretty quickly, on the grounds that life was too short to spend a chunk of it in the company of a wicked lunatic who can't write \"bum\" on a wall. So I missed this bit, summarised here by Thomas Frank, who has read the book so we don't have to: at one point, in what would appear to be the most clunking symbolism, a train crashes because \u2013 this is always happening on trains \u2013 a powerful politician insists on the crew driving into a dangerous tunnel.</p> <p>\"And then, in a notorious passage, the narrator goes through all the other passenger cars on the train and tells us why each casualty-to-be deserves the fate that is coming to him or her. One of them, she points out, received government loans; another doesn't like businessmen; a third is married to a federal regulator; a fourth foolishly thinks she has a right to ride on a train even when she doesn't personally own the train in question.\"</p> <p>I am going to trust Frank's precis; it certainly does not contradict what I already knew of Rand's opinions, even though it seems improbably extreme. (But it's not. It really is in the book, and our own George Monbiot was recently denounced by a Randian \u2013 frighteningly, former ambassador <a href=\"http://www.thecommentator.com/article/969/george_monbiot_s_abject_failure_to_understand_ayn_rand\" title=\"\">George Crawford \u2013 for taking issue with the passage</a>. The problem with Rand is that she is still hugely popular among Americans of certain political convictions. This is also our problem, too, as Frank, in his astute assessment of her, shows.</p> <p>The title and subtitle of his book give you a pretty good idea of what to expect: a horrific catalogue of the Tea Party's hijacking of populist outrage at the crash of 2008, when audiences were invited \u2013 in true Randian fashion \u2013 to save their pity and their sympathy for the very architects of that crash. There are also plenty of revealing asides. Because we are nice herbivores on this paper, we have been sheltered from, for example, the spending advice given in a 2007 edition of Trader Monthly, which gave as one compelling reason for buying a $300,000 turntable, the opportunity to give \"a huge middle finger to everyone who enters your home\".</p> <p>Frank does not pussyfoot around the implications we can draw about the soul of such a person. \"A trader was not just an \u00fcberconsumer but a bullying, self-maximising, wealth-extracting he-man: a lout, in full.\"</p> <p>It is, for some chapters, an extremely depressing read, but a very compelling one, and useful to place the otherwise mystifying ascendancy of the Tea Party movement, and its subsequent near-takeover of the Republican party, in context. Frank has a breezy way with comparative history: his description of the differences between how Roosevelt managed the 1929 crash, and how the 2008 disaster was handled, is concise \u2013 and enough to make you weep. As, too, is his explanation of how it came about that the Democrats have become so removed from what should have been their grass-roots support. (This, admittedly, is not a phenomenon we are unaware of over here.)</p> <p>There is hope \u2013 the Occupy movement, the reclamation of some level of proper populist outrage (the 99% v the 1%), and \u2013 although Frank's book came out too early for this \u2013 the astonishing stupidity and crassness of just about everything Mitt Romney has said during his election campaign. Then again, when you have people claiming that universal healthcare is tantamount to communism or euthanasia, or both, or that Europe, in its adoption of \"socialism\" after the second world war, became, in its entirety, a stranger to freedom of speech and thought ever after; and when you have any number of flat-earthers and Fox news ranters who peddle similar distortions \u2013 you really have to worry. This is a deeply troubling book, and at times I felt like the Jewish kids in Howard Jacobson's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780099501367/kalooki-nights\" title=\"\"><em>Kalooki Nights</em></a>, with their fascination for books about the Third Reich; but as a clear picture of the problem, it's important.</p>",
  "<p>When <a href=\"http://blackburnlabour.org/history/barbara-castle/\" title=\"\">Barbara Castle</a> appointed the young Jack Straw as her special adviser at the social services department in 1974, she said she wanted him for his \"guile and low cunning\". She was not, presumably, disappointed. Straw went on to be a Labour frontbencher \u2013 in either the cabinet or shadow cabinet \u2013 for 23 consecutive years. In all that time, he resisted categorisation into any of the party's many strands of opinion and faction. After becoming an MP in 1979, he joined the leftwing Tribune Group and voted for Michael Foot as party leader. He also voted for Tony Benn as deputy leader against Denis Healey, a decision which, in this book, he rather ungallantly attributes to Castle's flawed advice. Thirteen years later, he managed Tony Blair's leadership campaign. Thirteen years after that, he managed Gordon Brown's.</p> <p>He was privy to most of the serious plotting against Brown and even emerged as the favourite not only to succeed the failing leader but to deliver the bad news to him. But a visit to Downing Street with the deputy leader, Harriet Harman, amusingly recounted in this book, ended with Straw merely telling Brown to \"widen the political circle involved in election planning\". Bennite, Kinnockite, Cookite, Blairite, Brownite: Straw somehow avoided all the labels, even though, by publishing an anti-clause IV pamphlet in 1993, he was in some respects an early outrider for Blair.</p> <p>To dismiss Straw as an unprincipled and narrowly ambitious politician is to miss the point. Straw is tribal Labour; his maternal grandfather was a Transport and General Workers' Union shop steward, his mother a Labour councillor. At 13, he decided, while delivering leaflets in pouring rain during the 1959 election campaign, that he'd like to be an MP. The abiding principle of Straw's life is that Labour should be in power. What it should use power for is something he hardly seems to think about. He has never claimed to be a conviction politician. Rather, he is a managerial one, as was evident even when he was <a href=\"http://www.nusconnect.org.uk/news/article/nus/2589/\" title=\"\">National Union of Students president</a>, elected on a \"radical\" ticket but never seen without a tie. As a student politician, he worked with the Communist party, because he admired its organisation and discipline.</p> <p>He records, with some pride, his skill at avoiding direct questions and showcases Castle's \"guile and low cunning\" comment below a chapter heading. He admits (five times, as meticulously recorded in the index) to \"anorak\" tendencies: his strongest passions are mostly to do with constitutional, administrative and electoral arrangements. He supported abolition of clause IV not because of strong views about the merits of private against public ownership, but because he thought it would help Labour get elected. As shadow home secretary, and then as home secretary, he proposed illiberal policies, such as increasing police powers and restricting jury trials, mainly because he didn't want Labour to be thought \"soft on crime\". By reputation a long-standing Eurosceptic, he unhesitatingly assured Blair that, if there were a referendum on the euro, he would support the government line. He dismisses an \"ethical foreign policy\" as an \"unhelpful\" label. Referring to Blair, he observes acerbically that \"a 'world view' is a dangerous and misguided notion.\"</p> <p>The big philosophical issues of politics \u2013 the role of the state, the limits of markets, the merits of egalitarianism \u2013 are scarcely on Straw's radar. Big pictures and big ideas are not for him. His habit is to amble along in roughly the same direction as everyone else. Still an MP, Straw voted for David Miliband as Labour leader, as most Labour MPs did, but now, like most Labour MPs, thinks Ed has \"shown himself to be decisive and \u2026 made some difficult moves well\".</p> <p>These memoirs are better written than most. There is ample gossip and genuinely funny stories, of which the best concern a chief whip who made his point by squeezing Straw's testicles, and health and safety officials who stopped the union flag flying on Portcullis House. As well as waspish observations about personalities \u2013 Charles Clarke is \"a quixotic contrarian\" \u2013 there are revealing anecdotes. For example, when the Labour government won a Commons division on top-up university fees by just five votes, Straw warned Blair not to push his luck too far. \"'Jack,' he replied, with blue eyes blazing, 'I'm always lucky.'\"</p> <p>The most absorbing part of the book concerns his traumatic childhood and early adulthood. He recalls, without self-pity, how his parents quarrelled bitterly and eventually parted; how, aged nine, he saw a maternal uncle beat up his father and, next day, found his father attempting suicide; how he was initially so unhappy at boarding school (to which he won a free scholarship) that he ran away three times in one week. Later, Straw's first wife developed anorexia and their child died at six days old. Straw himself suffered chronic tinnitus after an ear infection. Depression led him to consult a psychoanalyst whom he still sees occasionally.</p> <p>But the section that will attract greatest interest is disappointing. He describes his decision, as foreign secretary, to support an invasion of Iraq as \"the most difficult and momentous \u2026 I've ever made\". He could, as he says, have stopped UK involvement. His explanation of how he reached his decision, however, is unconvincing. We learn almost nothing about the thought processes that led a former Aldermaston marcher \u2013 whose father was a conscientious objector in the second world war, whose mother joined the Peace Pledge Union in the 30s, whose second wife and children opposed the Iraq invasion \u2013 to support the most controversial deployment of British military force in nearly 50 years. Straw has nothing to say about American use of (and possible British complicity in) extraordinary rendition. Nor does he comment on allegations that US neoconservatives wanted him out of the Foreign Office; he attributes his bitterly resented demotion in 2005 to Blair's jealousy of his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/apr/03/usa.iraq\" title=\"\">close relationship with Condoleezza Rice</a>, the US secretary of state.</p> <p>Perhaps there were no thought processes. Straw is a reactive politician, not a reflective one. There has always been a curious lack of passion to his politics and, on his own admission, he tends, because of his childhood, to bury his feelings. He says in a footnote that he was confirmed in the Church of England in his 40s, but gives no clue as to how deep his religious beliefs go.</p> <p>The secret of what makes Straw tick may lie in his school holidays, when he worked for his uncle as a plumber's mate. He learned \"to cut, bend and solder pipes, and much else\". That was how he approached government and policy-making: he aimed to keep the water flowing and the boiler flues clear. He was New Labour's safe pair of hands, its trusty plumber, a much more competent than average minister. The conception of the project may have been flawed, fatally so in the case of the Iraq war. But it isn't a plumber's job to worry about the architecture.</p>",
  "<p>The past couple of weeks have been cause for a dual celebration in the biochemistry and molecular biology lab that I head at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha. For one, a postdoctoral fellow who has been working with me for the past three years has received an assistant professor faculty position \u2013 no small feat in these troubled times. And if that wasn't sufficient cause for celebration, I recently received notification of the renewal of one of my major sources of research funding for the next four years \u2013 a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).</p> <p>I gazed \u2013 shocked and awed \u2013 as amazement turned to relief, which morphed into a wondrous spurt of freedom and imagination as I realised that I will now be able to concentrate on <em>doing science</em> \u2013 rather than spending all of my time <em>proposing it</em>.</p> <p>However, my own good fortune notwithstanding, these days many scientists in the US are walking around with their heads lowered, muttering glaze-eyed and unfocused, openly pondering retirement and the end of the current wakeful nightmare. Most US universities use a system by which principal investigators receive a portion of their salaries from the institute. This magic number is often 75% in state universities \u2013 the supposed rationale being that the researcher doesn't teach during the summer, so if he/she wants to receive compensation, it should be from research grants. </p> <p>Some of the private institutions have even less of their scientists' salaries covered, dipping towards 50, 25 10 or even 0% in some cases. For those who think that tenured professors have it easy, please remember that tenure isn't very helpful if one isn't receiving a salary.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397023732\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/2/1349159378494/figure1.png\" alt=\"NIH funding has remained flat in real terms since 2005\" width=\"460\" height=\"274\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">NIH funding in real terms since 1998. <a href=\"http://dpcpsi.nih.gov/council/pdf/Council_of_Councils_090512.pdf\">NIH Council of Councils</a>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As I've hinted above, grants from the NIH are becoming increasingly difficult to obtain. The National Cancer Institute, one of the many institutes belonging to the NIH, had a payline recently of 6% \u2013 meaning that only grants ranked in the top 6% were assured funding. This means that of 20 grants being reviewed, roughly one would be funded. The others will have to manage without research dollars, or money for their salaries.</p> <p>The primary culprit for this situation is the NIH budget, coming in at about $32bn. Essentially, although the Clinton administration facilitated the doubling of the NIH budget just over 10 years ago, in terms of real buying power the budget has been flat for quite a few years (see graph). We have a burgeoning number of scientists, and universities are increasingly anxious to improve and enhance their scientific reputations. This makes for a lot more competition over the same wedge of pie. </p> <p>The NIH is reportedly finding it harder to recruit scientists for peer review of these grants. After all, it's depressing to try to distinguish between the merits of grants when only 1/20 are funded! How can a reviewer distinguish between a 6th and 8th percentile ranked grant?</p> <p>Traditionally, the NIH and science funding have been supported by both sides of the aisle, Democrats and Republicans, and by both arms of Congress, the House of Representatives and the Senate. But with a $900bn deficit looming for 2013, and calls for containing the deficit with cuts to government and government spending, predictions are that NIH will be lucky to get off with a small cut of several percent in the upcoming budget. This does not bode well for science.</p> <p>Neither candidate has (predictably) made science policy a major discussion point in his presidential campaign. However, pressed by scientists to answer 14 key questions ranging from their views on investing in science and basic research to climate change, both candidates submitted written answers which can be compared at <em><a href=\"http://www.sciencedebate.org/debate12/\">science debate</a></em>.</p> <p>Admittedly, both candidates come out in support of investing in science and basic science, although not surprisingly in extremely vague terms. Barack Obama specifically notes on a number of occasions the importance of public (and private) funded basic research and development. He notes the goal of investing ~3% of the GDP in research, and comments that he wants to double funding to key scientific agencies. </p> <p>Although no time frame is given (nor are the specific agencies identified), Obama has pledged to invest heavily in science education, particularly to enhance the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) fields. He has already begun to do so in the current term. In addition, Obama points to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act that he initiated in 2009 as part of the plan to inject capital into the American economy. Huge amounts of money flowed temporarily into the NIH \u2013 and although as a recipient of these funds I can't complain, as this clearly advanced my own research \u2013 many scientists have been critical of using such large amounts of money for short-term goals.</p> <p>Mitt Romney, while vaguely endorsing government-supported research and investment in it, seems to shy away from voicing too much support for such public research, and perhaps predictably emphasises the private sector. In comparing his answers to the 14 questions with those of Obama, Romney is less focused on presenting actual plans of what he will do, if elected, and appears more concerned with lashing out at those of his opponent. Romney's answers often are a rambling and rather diffused attack on the Obama administration's health care reform (which mandates that every American hold health insurance), and provide minimal substance on actual science policy.</p> <p>Stem cell research was not among the questions presented to the two candidates. However, upon assuming office in 2008, Obama did not take long to ease the restrictions on the use of federal research dollars for studies involving embryonic stem cells (put in place by his Republican predecessor, George W Bush). He has also approved the use of a wider variety of stem cells. Romney has said little about stem cells, but the antagonistic policy of his party is well noted.</p> <p>Given the track record of Obama in supporting education and science (despite difficult economic times), I have little doubt that he will do a better job in promoting science in this country. Knowing that his world view on other issues is closer to my own than that of Romney makes it a simple choice for me on election day \u2013 or as we say in the US, \"a no-brainer\".</p>",
  "<p>Labour's Liam Byrne has outlined the need to \"reinvent social security for modern times\" as he signalled the party intends to make savings in the welfare budget if it returns to power in 2015.</p> <p>Pointing to the growing resentment of benefit claimants by some sections of society, the shadow work and pensions secretary said he believed the fact that social security no longer enjoyed \"widespread support\" was linked to the fact it did not offer the same level of security as it once did.</p> <p>He said in an era in which \"jobs for life\" had gone, the system needed to work differently to reflect the fact that different things were needed from social security, with a \"much bigger push\" to get people back into work, new investment in areas such as childcare, and being \"much smarter\" about how the system set up to help disabled people worked.</p> <p>He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: \"The truth is the world of work has changed very radically since social security was set up back in the 1940s and for many people in work they don't actually feel they get much out for the pressures they have to contend with in everyday life, so I think that fractures support and I think that's why we do have to reinvent social security for modern times and the world today.\"</p> <p>Asked whether a Labour government would introduce further welfare savings, Byrne conceded cuts were likely because of the \"dog's breakfast\" Labour would inherit if it returned to power.</p> <p>\"The national debt is going to be over \u00a3400bn higher than it was at the last parliament,\" he said. \"Savings are going to have to be made and I think there will be savings that are needed on welfare spending too, and our challenge is how we spend that money differently to support people in work.\"</p> <p>Byrne said the \"zero-based review\" that Ed Miliband would conduct if Labour won the 2015 general election would look at the \"balance\" between universal and targeted benefits.</p> <p>\"There has always been a balance in the welfare state between universal benefits and targeted benefits and I'm afraid as part of Ed's zero-based review that balance has got to be looked at, but the chief focus has got to be on getting as many people into jobs as possible. It's good for living standards, it's good for growth and it's good for tax.\"</p> <p>Byrne also used the interview to call for a government rethink on its plans to set one national benefits cap, saying it would make \"much more sense to have a different cap in different parts of the country\".</p> <p>Speaking before Miliband's party conference speech in Manchester on Tuesday, Byrne suggested an independent panel of experts should examine the issue to ensure \"no matter where you live, you are better off in work\".</p> <p>He backed the principle of a cap on benefits, but added: \"They have, in a clumsy and pretty politicised way, tried to set one national cap for the country whereas everybody knows that one cap for the whole of Britain would be pumped up a bit by the very, very high levels of rent and housing benefit that you see in London.</p> <p>\"We've said, 'Look, come on, think about this carefully. It would make much more sense to have a different cap in different parts of the country and let's try and take the politics out of that a bit.'</p> <p>\"Let's get an independent panel of wise experts who can look at this and say what is the right level in different parts of the country, so that no matter where you live, you are better off in work.\"</p>",
  "<p>Early exit polls appear to give the Georgian billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili a victory in Georgia's parliamentary election , though his opponent, President Mikheil Saakashvili, also insisted last night that his party was in the lead.</p> <p>Two polls on Monday put Ivanishvili's Georgian Dream opposition coalition ahead of Mikheil Saakashvili's ruling United National Movement (UNM) party. Imedi TV said Ivanishvili had won 51% of the vote compared with 41% for UNM, with 35% of people refusing to reveal how they had voted. The Georgian public broadcaster had Georgian Dream and UNM tied, with 33% each. Georgian Dream's own pollster reported an overwhelming lead, with 62% against the UNM's 28%.</p> <p>Speaking after the polls were released, President Saakashvili conceded that the opposition had won in the \"proportional race\" \u2013 a reference to 77 seats chosen on a party-list system. However, he claimed his party was \"in the lead with a large margin\" outside the capital, Tbilisi. It had a \"significant advantage\" in 73 constituency seats, he said.</p> <p>Ivanishvili last night said his party had decisively won the poll. He also said it was on course to win at least 100 seats. He tweeted: \"The people of Georgia need to react to our victory calmly and remember that those who voted for the UNM are our brothers.\"</p> <p>His prediction \u2013 if confirmed on Tuesday \u2013 would be a devastating defeat for President Saakashvili, who swept to power in the rose revolution of 2003. It would also mark a remarkable democratic breakthrough for the small post-Soviet state. Whatever the final outcome, Georgia is now likely to have a parliament made up of genuine opposing forces.</p> <p>In Tbilisi, an opposition stronghold, Ivanishvili supporters poured on to the streets to celebrate. Several thousand celebrated in Freedom Square, waving blue Georgian Dream flags, with cars hooting horns. \"The reality is the majority of people in this country support Ivanishvili,\" said Tarel Peradze, an engineertold the Guardian.</p> <p>Speaking to his supporters at his party's HQ, Ivanishvili said his main priority was to \"unite our country so what was happening in Georgia will never happen again\", a reference to Georgia's alleged authoritarian drift during Saakashvili's eight years in power. He restated his commitment to a pro-western foreign policy, saying: \"We will move towards Nato and I believe we will become a member of Nato.\"</p> <p>The tycoon also said his first foreign trip \u2013 assuming he becomes prime minister \u2013 would be to the United States. He pledged not to clamp down on critical journalists \u2013 a hallmark, according to government critics, of Saakashvili's misrule \u2013 and said he would respect Georgia's ethnic minorities.</p> <p>One senior Georgian government source confirmed Saakashvili had lost the popular vote. But he said it was still possible the UNM would emerge with a \"slim majority\" in the new parliament. They said Saakashvili's apparent defeat in a fair election showed that the opposition charge he had turned into a despot was evidently erroneous.</p> <p>Saakashvili is due to carry on as president until October 2013. After this, Georgia shifts from a presidential to a parliamentary system with an executive prime minister in charge. If Ivanishvili does win a parliamentary majority, it is difficult to see how the two men could work together. Ivanishvili yesterday said he was ready to co-operate if made prime minister. \"From my side, no problem,\" he said.</p> <p>The campaign has featured vituperative statements from both sides, with Ivanishvili hinting in an interview with the Guardian on Sunday that the president was willing to do anything to stop him.</p>"
