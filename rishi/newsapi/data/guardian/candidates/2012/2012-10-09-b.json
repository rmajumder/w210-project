[
  "<p>Last weekend, hundreds of conservative churches <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/08/us-usa-tax-pulpit-idUSBRE89700E20121008\">participated</a> in \"Pulpit Freedom Sunday\", during which pastors preached about electoral politics and sent recordings of their sermons to the Internal Revenue Service. It's a provocation: these pastors and their legal counsel hope to challenge the rarely-enforced IRS rule prohibiting candidate endorsements by tax-exempt organizations, including houses of worship, and take it all the way to the US supreme court.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/Unaffiliated/nones-on-the-rise.aspx\">new survey from the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life</a>, which confirms previously observed trends of Protestant decline, accompanied by a rise in religiously unaffiliated Americans, casts serious doubt on whether the self-styled church freedom warriors are fighting a politically popular battle. Among the survey's findings, two thirds of Americans (66%) believe churches shouldn't endorse candidates. And 54% say churches should stay out of political matters entirely. Even a majority (56%) of white evangelicals agreed that churches should not endorse candidates.</p> <p>Would these data cause the churches clamoring for a legal war with the IRS to pack their bags and go home? Of course not. In fact, in spite of these trends away from organized religion and away from the entanglement of organized religion in politics, I would expect these culture war battles to ramp up \u2013 at least for the time being.</p> <p>The religious right hasn't <a href=\"http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/11/22/report-tracks-explosion-of-religious-lobbying-in-washington/?hpt=hp_t2\">spent millions</a> building up legal advocacy groups, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/08/republicans-judicial-activism-supreme-courts\">pressing for conservative judicial appointees</a>, and training lawyers and politicians to thump the Bible in legislatures and the courts for nothing. They've built an infrastructure to fight their battles, even as they lose public opinion wars. For their most ardent supporters, losing in the court of public opinion only serves as a call to redouble their efforts, to fulfil their call to carry out God's plan for America.</p> <p>But a provocation for secularists might emerge from these data: can they match the organization and intensity of their political adversaries?</p> <p>Looking at the Pew survey, one wonders how long the religious right can continue to use the same battle plan. Yet, the data shows they are clearly losing the public. Another survey last week from the Public Religion Research Institute showed that while Mitt Romney has <a href=\"http://www.religiondispatches.org/dispatches/sarahposner/6473/young_white_evangelicals_will_vote_romney,_poll_finds/\">the support of 80% of younger white evangelical millennials</a> (aged 18 to 25), this is a small and diminishing constituency: white evangelicals <a href=\"http://www.religiondispatches.org/dispatches/sarahposner/6473/young_white_evangelicals_will_vote_romney,_poll_finds/\">comprise only 12.3%</a> of that age group. That's less than half their proportion of the 50 to 64 population. The Pew survey showed that while 32% of Americans aged 50 to 64 are white evangelicals, only 13% of those aged 18 to 29 are.</p> <p>As Protestants have declined, percentages of Catholics have remained steady. While they are far less homogeneous politically than evangelicals (the Pew poll found Catholics favor legal abortion 50% to 45%, and same-sex marriage 53% to 37%), the generational trend lines might explain why religious conservatives are intensifying evangelical-Catholic alliances around issues like contraception coverage and same-sex marriage. This is further evidence that, despite demographic shifts, they're not giving up without a fight \u2013 instead, shifting their strategy to frame these concerns as ones of \"religious freedom\". If they're a minority, they hope to reap political benefits from arguing at least that they are a persecuted one.</p> <p>The Pew survey also found there are now as many \"nones\" as there are white evangelicals \u2013 each makes up 19% of the US population. But the generational trends are traveling even more starkly in a non-theist direction: 32% of 18 to 29 year-olds are unaffiliated, and 42% of those describe themselves as atheist or agnostic. That's over ten points higher than the 21% of 30- to 49-year-old \"nones\" who describe themselves that way, and more than twice the 15% of 50- to 64-year-old \"nones\" who do.</p> <p>That has to worry Republicans. White evangelicals are the most sizable segment of their base and the unaffiliated \u2013 in particular, the atheists and agnostics \u2013 are the most sizable part of the Democratic base. Still, Republicans maintain a party identification advantage among Christians as a whole (with the exception of black Protestants and all Catholics, which includes Latino Catholics). Because Democrats, overall, have a party identification advantage over the GOP (48% to 43%, according to Pew), will those numbers make each party intensify their efforts to make religious voters happy, or encourage them to present a less religious case for election?</p> <p>With a tight presidential race, and each campaign trying to peel away as many persuadable voters in swing states as possible, appeals to religion \u2013 including from the Obama camp \u2013 are likely to continue, if only to targeted audiences. Oddly, 67% of all groups, including nearly a third of \"nones\", agree it's important for the president to have \"strong religious beliefs\". At the same time, though, 43% of all groups said it makes them uncomfortable when politicians talk about how religious they are.</p> <p>The numbers are important, telling and potentially transformative for our politics. Yet, questions remain: there's nothing in the Pew survey on public attitudes about religious freedom, church-state separation or the secular nature of our government. These are the issues around which the \"nones\" can organize. The religious right, whose leaders maintain America is in the throes of a revival, has spent decades mythologizing a \"Christian nation\", denigrating and undermining church-state separation, and questioning the very American-ness of secularists.</p> <p>While this is just one survey, and the \"Christian nation\" advocates retain their intensity and organization, there's evidence here that an opening exists for a new revival: a secularist one.</p>",
  "<p>The transformation of Latin America is one of the decisive changes reshaping the global order. The tide of progressive change that has swept the region over the last decade has brought a string of elected socialist and social-democratic governments to office that have redistributed wealth and power, rejected western neoliberal orthodoxy, and challenged imperial domination. In the process they have started to build the first truly independent South America for 500 years and demonstrated to the rest of the world that there are, after all, economic and social alternatives in the 21st century.</p> <p>Central to that process has been Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and his <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivarian_Revolution\" title=\"\">Bolivarian revolution</a> in Venezuela. It is Venezuela, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/06/venezuela-election-result-oil-politics\" title=\"\">sitting on the world's largest proven oil reserves</a>, that has spearheaded the movement of radical change across Latin America and underwritten the regional integration that is key to its renaissance. By doing so, the endlessly vilified Venezuelan leader has earned the enmity of the US and its camp followers, as well as the social and racial elites that have called the shots in Latin America for hundreds of years.</p> <p>So Ch\u00e1vez's remarkable presidential election victory on Sunday \u2013 in which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/interactive/2012/oct/09/venezuela-election-results-map-open-data\" title=\"\">he won 55% of the vote on an 81% turnout after 14 years in power</a> \u2013 has a significance far beyond Venezuela, or even Latin America. The stakes were enormous: if his oligarch challenger <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-19858755\" title=\"\">Henrique Capriles</a> had won, not only would the revolution have come to a juddering halt, triggering privatisations and the axing of social programmes. So would its essential support for continental integration, mass sponsorship of Cuban doctors across the hemisphere \u2013 as well as Ch\u00e1vez's plans to reduce oil dependence on the US market.</p> <p>Western and Latin American media and corporate elites had convinced themselves that they were at last in with a shout, that this election was \"too close to call\", or even that a failing Venezuelan president, weakened by cancer, would at last be rejected by his own people. Outgoing World Bank president <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-06-08/world-bank-chief-zoellick-says-chavez-s-days-are-numbered\" title=\"\">Robert Zoellick crowed that Ch\u00e1vez's days were \"numbered\"</a>, while <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-10-08/chavez-win-called-by-bofa-points-to-bond-rout-as-barclays-flops\" title=\"\">Barclays let its excitement run away with itself by calling the election for Capriles</a>.</p> <p>It's all of a piece with the endlessly recycled Orwellian canard that Ch\u00e1vez is some kind of a dictator and Venezuela a tyranny where elections are rigged and the media muzzled and prostrate. But as opposition leaders concede, Venezuela is by any rational standards a democracy, with exceptionally high levels of participation, its electoral process more fraud-proof than those in Britain or the US, and its media dominated by a vituperatively anti-government private sector. In reality, the greatest threat to Venezuelan democracy came in the form of the abortive <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/apr/21/usa.venezuela\" title=\"\">US-backed coup of 2002</a>.</p> <p>Even senior western diplomats in Caracas roll their eyes at the absurdity of the anti-Ch\u00e1vez propaganda in the western media. And in the queues outside polling stations on Sunday, in the opposition stronghold of San Crist\u00f3bal near the Colombian border, Capriles voters told me: \"This is a democracy.\" Several claimed that if Ch\u00e1vez won, it wouldn't be because of manipulation of the voting system but the \"laziness\" and \"greed\" of their fellow Venezuelans \u2013 by which they seemed to mean the appeal of government social programmes.</p> <p>Which gets to the heart of the reason so many got the Venezuelan election wrong. Despite claims that Latin America's progressive tide is exhausted, leftwing and centre-left governments continue to be re-elected \u2013 from Ecuador to Brazil and Bolivia to Argentina \u2013 because they have reduced poverty and inequality and taken control of energy resources to benefit the excluded majority.</p> <p>That is what Ch\u00e1vez has been able to do on a grander scale, using Venezuela's oil income and publicly owned enterprises to slash <a href=\"http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/venezuela-2012-09.pdf\" title=\"\">poverty by half and extreme poverty by 70%</a>, massively expanding access to health and education, sharply boosting the minimum wage and pension provision, halving unemployment, and giving slum communities direct control over social programmes.</p> <p>To visit any rally or polling station during the election campaign was to be left in no doubt as to who Ch\u00e1vez represents: the poor, the non-white, the young, the disabled \u2013 in other words, the dispossessed majority who have again returned him to power. Euphoria at the result among the poor was palpable: in the foothills of the Andes on Monday groups of red-shirted hillside farmers chanted and waved flags at any passerby.</p> <p>Of course there is also no shortage of government failures and weaknesses which the opposition was able to target: from runaway violent crime to corruption, lack of delivery and economic diversification, and over-dependence on one man's charismatic leadership. And the <a href=\"http://transition.usaid.gov/performance/cbj/158267.pdf\" title=\"\">US-financed opposition campaign</a> was a much more sophisticated affair than in the past. Capriles presented himself as \"centre-left\", despite his hard right background, and promised to maintain some Chavista social programmes.</p> <p>But even so, the Venezuelan president ended up almost 11 points ahead. And the opposition's attempt to triangulate to the left only underlines the success of&#xa0;Ch\u00e1vez in changing Venezuela's society and political terms of trade. He has shown himself to be the most electorally successful radical left leader in history. His re-election now gives him the chance to ensure Venezuela's transformation is deep enough to survive him, to overcome the administration's failures and help entrench the process of change across the continent.</p> <p>Venezuela's revolution doesn't offer a political model that can be directly transplanted elsewhere, not least because oil revenues allow it to target resources on the poor without seriously attacking the interests of the wealthy. But its innovative social programmes, experiments in direct democracy and success in bringing resources under public control offer lessons to anyone interested in social justice and new forms of socialist politics in the rest of the world.</p> <p>For all their problems and weaknesses, Venezuela and its Latin American allies have demonstrated that it's no longer necessary to accept a failed economic model, as many social democrats in Europe still do. They have shown it's possible to be both genuinely progressive and popular. Cynicism and media-fuelled ignorance have prevented many who would naturally identify with Latin America's transformation from recognising its significance. But Ch\u00e1vez's re-election has now ensured that the process will continue \u2013 and that the space for 21st-century alternatives will grow.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SeumasMilne\" title=\"\"><em>@SeumasMilne</em></a></p>",
  "<p>Israel's prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has called a general election early next year in a move designed to avoid a damaging defeat over a proposed austerity budget but also likely to give him a renewed and potentially increased mandate for military action against Iran.</p> <p>\"I have decided, for the benefit of Israel, to hold elections now and as quickly as possible,\" Netanyahu said at a press conference, without specifying the date of the poll.</p> <p>Israel's economy and national security are the two issues likely to dominate the election campaign, with the question of a peace agreement with the Palestinians being pushed down the political agenda. The election is expected to be in late January or early February.</p> <p>Netanyahu's party, Likud, is expected to comfortably win the largest share of the Israeli parliament's 120 seats, almost four years after the last election in February 2009. The prime minister had the option of waiting until next October before going to the electorate.</p> <p>His coalition government has proved unexpectedly stable despite repeated threats by his small rightwing coalition partners to bring down the government. Under Israel's electoral system of proportional representation the leader of the biggest party will have to negotiate with smaller parties to form a new coalition government.</p> <p>Netanyahu's decision to call early elections rests on two main domestic considerations. The first is the forthcoming national budget. The prime minister faces a struggle to get an austerity budget passed in the face of the warring interests of the smaller parties in his coalition who have an eye on their constituencies. He may believe it is better to call an election than see the government fall in the wake of the budget crashing in flames. The second concerns his political opponents. Kadima, the main opposition party, is currently floundering in the polls. The latest Haaretz survey gives it eight seats, down from 28 at the last election. Labour is the principal beneficiary, with its projected number of seats rising to 20 from 13.</p> <p>But Netanyahu's Likud is predicted to be the biggest party by some measure in the 120-seat Knesset, with 28 seats. The prime minister's personal ratings on suitability to lead the next government are way ahead of those of his rivals.</p> <p>On the assumption that Netanyahu forms the next coalition government, he may opt for a more centrist complexion than the current rightwing composition. After the last election Netanyahu's first move was to bring Kadima into the coalition, only resorting to the small religious parties when that failed. A \"national unity\" government may give him cover to pursue military action against Iran.</p> <p>Iran is Netanyahu's primary issue. At the United Nations he publicly deferred the likely date of Israeli military action against Iran's nuclear programme until next spring or summer. Netanyahu will hope to win a renewed electoral mandate before such a high-risk move, rather than launch a potentially disastrous war in the months running up to a general election.</p> <p>The outcome of the US election may also be a factor in Netanyahu's decision. If Barack Obama is re-elected in November, he may seek to punish the Israeli prime minister for his perceived support for the Republican candidate, Mitt Romney. That approach will be harder if Netanyahu also has a renewed mandate.</p> <p>Opposition parties will be keen to make the economy the significant issue of the election. Before Netanyahu's announcement the Labour leader, Shelly Yacimovich, said early elections would end an \"unstable and unhealthy\" situation.</p>",

They have <a href=\"http://www.sesameworkshop.org/our-blog/2012/10/09/sesame-workshop-response-to-campaign-ads/\">asked</a> the Obama campaign to take down an election advert featuring Big Bird on the grounds that the show is non-partisan and does not participate in political campaigns.</p> <p>Shame on you Sesame Workshop! In an election year distinguished by a blitzkrieg of TV ads that have been almost universally ugly and grim, this <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/BarackObamadotcom\">one</a> is actually quite funny. Invoking such titans of financial wrong-doing as Bernie Madoff, Ken Lay and Dennis Kozlowski, it identifies the \"evil genius\" who towered over them.</p> <p>\"Big. Yellow. A menace to our economy. Mitt Romney knows it's not Wall Street you have to worry about, it's Sesame Street.\"</p> <p>No-one was more surprised than Big Bird himself when he became the Joe the Plumber of the 2012 presidential election. Over the past four decades has shown more interest in unicycles than in politics.</p> <p>But last week he was suddenly propelled into the center of the White House race when Romney vowed to cut federal funding for the public TV network PBS. \"I love Big Bird,\" the Republican nominee said, flashing a smile that made him look just like the Big Bad Wolf.</p>",

They are socially conservative, and believe in family, community and tradition. They admit that 1979 brought problems as well as benefits. They are sceptical of big business wielding too much power and stick up for strivers, whether they work in the public or private sector. They believe there is such a thing as society.

Right now large numbers of those sentences deliver no punishment at all. We will change that. We will legislate to make sure there is a punitive element as part of every community order.</p> <p>We are also legislating to use more state of the art technology to enforce curfews and exclusion zones.

The Financial Times called it \"shock therapy for the country\", a quote the publishers apparently took as a compliment.</p> <p>I usually try to adopt a neutral tone in these blogposts, but I have to say I found the whole thing pretty terrifying. Britannia Unhinged might have been a better title.</p> <p>Raab lamented the fact that their book had been caricatured as \"Tories blast lazy Brits\", but said that since Thomas Edison's time \"the average number of hours worked by Britons has fallen by a third \u2026 We have a shrinking proportion peddling harder and harder not just to drive our economy but also to maintain our precious public services.\"</p> <p>He was keen for this not to be seen as public sector v private sector - he said that since 1997 lawyers' hours had stayed constant while police officers' had increased, for example - but he rather let the cat out of the bag by adding: \"On average public sector workers work two hours a week less than private sector employees yet they're paid more and they're less productive.\"</p> <p>Raab said that \"Labour's push to get 50% of young people into university was particularly pernicious. Too many of our universities are instilling a culture of laziness\" just when we needed the opposite. University students worked on average 26 hours a week, he said - \"seven hours less than the European average\". (The idea that university work can be totted up and compared this way seems a bit reductive to me.)</p> <p>He concluded: \"We're going to have to rediscover, recognise and reward the lost value of hard graft that made this country great\" - which really is not a million miles away from \"Tories blast lazy Brits\".</p> <p>Kwarteng also touched on education, saying that for 30 years exam results had improved, a sequence that could only be seen in the \"natural world\" in terms of life expectancy. Everyone else seems to be using the Olympics as an example of everything at the moment, so I will just politely ask him to consider that physical and sporting achievements are almost uniformly on the same sort of upward curves.</p> <p>Asked about the cancelled Building Schools for the Future programme, Skidmore said private companies made \"rapacious\" profits from it. \"Why do we not then have for-profit schools? \u2026 India, China, they're not spending the big bucks on the buildings. It's the teachers that matter.\"</p> <p>If anything, the audience seemed even more rightwing than the panel. The MPs were asked by businesswoman Rachel McLean: \"When I go to India I don't hear anybody talking about work-life balance \u2026 Why do we spend all our time talking about it in the UK?\"</p> <p>Raab replied that his wife was expecting their first child, but she \"earns considerably more than me\" so \"how do you balance the dual roles of breadwinning and childcaring?\" That was a \"major issue\" for his family, he said, although he did not see it as one of work-life balance.</p> <p>Patel said of Indian businessman Ratan Tata \"there was a great deal of hysteria when he said he comes over here and at 5pm people are simply not there [at work]\". There were different cultures in the country regarding work, she said. Her own immigrant parents \"worked 24/7 running small shops\", and Patel said she shared that work ethic.</p> <p>It was left to one delegate to point out that in countries such as India and China that the authors were lionising great proportions of the population \"work very hard but for very little money\". Patel said they weren't holding up these countries as role models but merely pointing out that they were now Britain's competitors.</p> <p>A male delegate asked why there was such public hostility to the \"modest improvements\" (aka cuts) the government were making. Raab's impenetrable answer was: \"We don't stretch debate enough \u2026 What we must do is have more rigour and more scrutiny and open it up.\" Kwarteng said those protesting were merely speaking up for their own \"sectional interests\".</p> <p>Kwarteng, as you might expect, attacked Labour for having run up deficits in times of growth. But more surprisingly he praised the 1997-2001 Labour government - which didn't do that - as \"probably the best government on a fiscal basis since the war\".</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T15:23:17.102Z\">at 4.23pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50743737c0e361310bc6ca8f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T14:39:51.714Z\">3.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Chris Grayling, the justice secretary, is speaking now.

But what matters is that the punishment will be chosen by the victim. <br>&#xa0;<br>For too long, victims of crime have had no voice - but this government is giving victims back their voice.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 She criticised Labour for choosing former politicians as police commissioner candidates.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Conservative candidates include a former air chief marshal, several magistrates, business men and women and former police officers. <br>&#xa0;<br>Looking at Labour's candidates, they seem to think the public are desperate for one last reunion tour of the politicians they rejected at the last election - Lord Prescott and the Has Beens, coming soon to a venue near you.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 She accused Labour of using immigration to keep down wages.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When we came to office, we found that official government assessments assumed that there was absolutely no displacement of British workers by immigrants. No wonder all the Whitehall departments were lined up in favour of more and more immigration. So when we asked our independent advisers to look at the effect of immigration on jobs, they found that every 100 non-European working age immigrants were associated with 23 fewer British-born people in work. <br>&#xa0;<br>And, by the way, Labour knew just what they were doing.

They are saying that teachers shouldn't do photocopying, they are saying that teachers shouldn't put up displays, they are saying that teachers shouldn't invigilate exams.

As the Press Association reports, she defended the government's controversial commitment to overseas aid spending, but insisted countries should lose funding as they become better off - signalling she would cut the \u00a31bn cheque sent from British taxpayers to India every year. Greening said: \"I'm going to take a new approach to ensure that every pound we spend has the biggest possible impact. That may well mean stopping programmes where I don't think they are working and putting the money elsewhere.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Owen Paterson, the environment secretary, has said a badger cull is necessary to prevent bovine TB costing the taxpayer \u00a31bn.</strong> As the Press Association reports, he said <a href=\"http://www.cpc12.org.uk/Speeches/Owen_Paterson.aspx\">in his speech </a>that bovine TB imposed a \"shattering emotional and financial cost\" on farmers and rural communities and it was essential to take every possible step to deal with the reservoir of the disease in the badger population. He also said wind farms should only be allowed where they were acceptable to the local community and promised his department would make it \"as simple as possible\" for shale gas projects to go ahead.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 The Advertising Standards Watchdog has closed its investigation into a website linked to the Conservative party chairman, Grant Shapps, after receiving assurances on its use of pseudonyms and testimonials.</strong> As the Press Association reports, the ASA launched an investigation into How To Corp after receiving complaints that the website misleadingly implied that the pen name Michael Green, formerly used by Shapps, was a real person, and that testimonials were not genuine. Shapps has not been involved with the website for some years, but the controversy has still undermined his standing as party chairman. An ASA spokesman said today: \"We have resolved the matter informally with How To Corp. We have received assurances that the marketer will in future make clear if pseudonyms are used and that they will not use testimonials in the absence of adequate evidence.\" The case has now been closed, said the spokesman.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/oct/09/david-cameron-100000-twitter-followers\">\u2022 Cameron has accumulated more than 100,000 followers since he launched a Twitter account on Saturday.</a></strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T13:15:05.519Z\">at 2.15pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50740d1ac0e361310bc6ca6f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T11:40:10.265Z\">12.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/oct/09/boris-johnson-the-best-jokes-from-his-conference-speech?CMP=twt_fd\">My colleague Paul Owen has posted a blog with all the best jokes from Boris Johnson's speech.</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50740cb958f91d7bbadac162\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T11:38:33.182Z\">12.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Andrew Neil has just finished interviewing Boris Johnson on the Daily Politics show.

Before he arrives, it's worth quoting an extract from an article about the Johnson/Cameron rivalry in this week's New Statesman. It's by Andrew Gimson, Johnson's biographer.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Boris Johnson is trying to kill David Cameron. That may sound like an exaggeration, but the word \u201ckill\u201d was used by Johnson himself, in a column about \u201cthe basic drama of politics\u201d written soon after the Labour landslide of 1997: \u201cPolitics is a constant repetition, in cycles of varying length, of one of the oldest myths in human culture, of how we make kings for our societies, and how after a while we kill them to achieve a kind of rebirth \u2013 as Tony Blair would put it, new life for Britain\" \u2026</p> <p>Johnson is now in a position to persecute the prime minister almost daily. On past form, he will use the Tory conference in Birmingham once more to upstage Cameron. The Mayor of London can be bolder about tax cuts, the des\u00adirability of getting rid of the euro, the need for a new airport, the best ways of getting Labour voters to back the Tories, and also on any passing issue of the hour, such as the atrocious manners of Andrew Mitchell, the chief whip who called the police plebs. Cameron, as the cautious voice of the establishment, cannot match Johnson the Merry England maverick on any of these subjects.</p> <p>Over the next three years, we can expect Johnson to bend every sinew to demonstrate that he is the party\u2019s greatest electoral asset and the one man who could lead it to an overall majority. He will try to become the person to whom the party feels compelled to turn. It is notable that he is already spoken of as a man for the top job or for no job at all. If he does one day supplant Cameron, he will regard it as belated recognition of his natural supremacy.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T10:04:19.139Z\">at 11.04am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5073f3b558f91d7bbadac138\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T09:51:49.503Z\">10.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Boris bingo</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We're going to be playing Boris bingo during Johnson's speech, which starts in about 10 minutes. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/interactive/2012/oct/09/boris-johnson-speech-bingo-conservative-conference-2012\">Click here for your bingo card</a>.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T10:04:38.657Z\">at 11.04am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5073f22458f91d7bbadac137\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T09:45:08.723Z\">10.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are some of the best Conservative conference stories and articles from today's papers.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2214820/Pick-punishment-May-tells-victims-crime-unveils-sweeping-justice-reforms.html\">\u2022 Theresa May tells the Daily Mail in an interview that victims of antisocial behaviour will be given a say in how offenders are punished.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u2018One of the big problems for the victims of antisocial behaviour is that they feel powerless,\u2019 said Mrs May.</p> <p>\u2018Somebody does something to them or their property and they feel they don\u2019t get reparation, or feel they are not part of the process.</p> <p>\u2018We want to ensure that they have a choice.

What about the teacher who does not want to get into a row with the union or the single mother struggling to make ends meet?</p> <p>\u201cWe mustn\u2019t only be the party of a new generation of Essex men and women,\u201d says one Cabinet minister. \u201cWe\u2019ve also got to speak to people who have not ever been \u2018our people\u2019. We need to show we are worrying about those in genuine poverty, distress and need, to reassure people we are decent. It\u2019s not just about having a retail offer to someone in Stevenage.

I think you can phrase the law in all sorts of different ways, but the reality will end up being that the householder is entitled to use reasonable force to get rid of the burglar and that in measuring whether the force is reasonable or not, you are not doing a paper exercise six months later. You have to put yourself in the position of the man or woman who has reacted to the presence of a burglar and has reacted with fury, with anxiety, with fear, and with all the various different emotions which will be generated, and who has no time for calm reflection.

To influence the BBC, the answer must be the Guardian. Between April 2010 and February it bought 59,829 copies of the paper \u2013 more than any other.

Here are the main points. I've taken some of the quotes from the Press Association.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Cameron said that having a referendum would be \"the cleanest, neatest, simplest and most sensible\" way of obtaining public consent for a new settlement with the EU</strong>. Previously he said that a referendum or a general election could be used to obtain public support for a new EU deal, but this morning's comment makes it almost inevitable that the party will back a referendum (see 8.39am).</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the government was changing the law about tackling burglars because currently there was \"uncertainty\" about the level of force that was allowed.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think there has been uncertainty about what proportionate means are so we are saying you can do anything as long as it is not grossly disproportionate. You couldn't, for instance, stab a burglar if they were unconscious. But really we should be putting the law firmly on the side of the homeowner, the householder, the family and saying, when that burglar crosses that threshold, invades your home, threatens your family, they give up their rights \u2026</p> <p>I'm more interested in the rights of the people who want to defend their homes and their properties.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He claimed that he was not concerned that Boris Johnson was more popular with the Conservative party than he was.</strong> On ITV's Daybreak the presenter said that, while the Tories were chanting \"Boris, Boris, Boris\", they weren't chanting \"Dave, Dave, Dave\". Cameron said this because he was prime minister.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are lots of people that are more popular than me in this world, because I have to be the one who takes the difficult decisions on behalf of the country to recover us from the dreadful state that Labour left us in. That's just life, but in politics what matters is you do your duty, you do the right thing for your country.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also said that he wanted to have \"big stars in the Conservative party that can carry our message to the country\". He said he had told Johnson that, when he stands down as mayor, he should look for another job in politics. Cameron may, however, have given a better indication of his true feelings when James Naughtie asked if he had thought of offering Johnson a job abroad. Cameron clearly found the prospect attractive (see 8.30am and 8.53am).</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He rejected claims that the welfare cuts announced this week meant that the Conservatives were once more the \"nasty\" party.</strong> When this was put to him on ITV's Daybreak, he replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don't accept that for a moment. When we came to power there were people all over the country getting up and going to work and their taxes were going towards families in London who were getting each \u00a350,000-\u00a360,000 of housing benefit every year. That isn't fair, so I want a fair welfare system that works for everybody.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also rejected claims that the Conservative party was turning to the right. Citing his decision to announce more money for the NHS and to protect the aid budget, he said the party was not being leftwing or rightwing but just demonstrating \"sensible, common ground, common sense. Conservative, practical thinking\".</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He refused to say whether or not he believed Andrew Mitchell's denial that he called police officers at the gates of Downing Street \"plebs\". </strong>When James Naughtie said that Cameron had chosen to believe Mitchell rather than the officer who wrote up a report of the incident in his log, Cameron queried this.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No, what I chose to do was accept the fact that Andrew Mitchell has apologised and the police don't want to take their complaint further, or take any further action, and they accepted his apology. This is what I accept. I'm not going to go into the private conversations I had. Suffice it to say, what happened was completely unacceptable and must never happen again.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that the new IMF report saying the British economy will shrink this year would not lead the government to change course economically.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What the IMF are saying is, first of all they are coming into line with other forecasts, which are disappointing, that there is going to be a very poor picture for growth in Europe. They are not advising us to change course, they are saying unless things get dramatically worse, we should stick to our plans, which is about reducing public spending and dealing with debt and deficit.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He hinted that he would be happy to see Jimmy Savile <strong> posthumously</strong> stripped of his knighthood.</strong> This is what he told ITV when asked if he was in favour of this.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have something called a forfeiture committee. It is not chaired or sat on by me but it is responsible for looking at honours and the removal of honours, and obviously they have to do their job too.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that he had been burgled twice when he was living in North Kensington.</strong> \"There was one occasion when I left the keys of my car and they loaded up my Skoda and drove off and that was particularly angst-making.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said he hoped his wife Samantha would take him out for a balti tonight to celebrate his birthday.</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T09:37:19.130Z\">at 10.37am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5073d6d4c0e361310bc6ca3e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T07:53:53.695Z\">8.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's some Twitter reaction to the Cameron Today interview.</p> <p>From the Daily Mail's James Chapman</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jameschappers/status/255568239873110016\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Dave is eating Naughtie for breakfast.

He's sent me this.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am told to expect a big announcement today from Theresa May that will make huge waves with the police, the Lib Dems and the UK's European partners. May is expected to indicate at the very least that the UK will opt out of EU police and justice co-operation when the decision has to be made in 2014. This will be packaged up as part of the UK repatriating powers from Europe. But it will be hugely controversial as it involves areas of international police co-operation including the European arrest warrant, the instrument under which James Forrest was arrested recently in France after leaving the country with his pupil Megan Stammers. The arrest warrant is seen by police and intelligence officers as one of the most successful instruments in European crime fighting, having helped speed up extraditions and the whole process of bringing some of Europe's most wanted criminals to justice. If the UK opts out of all police and justice co-operation it can selectively opt back in to some of it at a later stage, provided other countries do so. But this is an important statement of this government's new direction on Europe. Nick Clegg has gone out of his way to praise the arrest warrant and the broader policy of cross-border crime fighting.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T08:37:55.822Z\">at 9.37am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5073ca6058f91d7bbadac11b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T06:56:49.424Z\">7.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It's David Cameron's 46th birthday today and he's celebrating it by giving a round of interviews.

  "<p>First, Mitt Romney threatened to cut funding to Big Bird. Now, in another campaign-strategy foul against the voters of tomorrow, his campaign has announced he has turned down a request to appear on Nickelodeon's election special. </p> <p>The children's channel launched the show, Kids Pick the President: The Candidates, in 1988. Candidates answer videotaped questions from children, and then viewers can vote for their choice of president in an online poll. In five of the past six presidential elections, child voters chose the same candidate as the eventual winner of the adult poll.</p> <p>President Barack Obama accepted an invitation to appear this year. Nickelodeon said it would use file clips of Romney addressing some of the issues raised in the questions posed by viewers.</p> <p>Linda Ellerbee, host of Nick News, said she was disappointed by the Romney team's decision.</p> <p>\"I would be equally disappointed if he had said yes and Obama said no,\" Ellerbee told the Guardian. \"It's not a personal thing, it's just a shame when both candidates don't see it as something important.\"</p> <p>Only two other presidential-hopefuls have refused invitations to the show. John Kerry declined the offer in 2004 and George W Bush withdrew in response. He had participated in 2000.</p> <p>The network said Nick News reached out to Romney several times since April, but his campaign told the program he couldn't fit the appearance in his schedule. </p> <p>\"I am still holding the door open until midnight October 14, I can work all night and cut the show and get him in. We'll meet him anywhere,\" Ellerbee said.</p> <p>The special will air on 15 October on Nickelodeon.</p> <p>Obama answered questions about the top campaign issues of this year's election for the special and responded to the kids' questions about jobs, same-sex marriage, illegal immigration and gun control. He also talked about heartbreak and his most embarrassing moment, said the network. </p> <p>\"Running into the wall is par for the course for me,\" the president said.&#xa0;\"I'm running into doors and desks all the time.\"</p> <p>Kids Pick the President sets out to increase children's understanding and awareness of the election, candidates and campaign issues and will announce the poll results on-air Monday, 22 October. </p> <p>The Romney campaign did not respond to requests for comment. </p> <p>In the first presidential debate last week, <a href=\"http://\">Romney provoked anger from another bastion of children's television</a> \u2013&#xa0;Sesame Street. The 43-year-old television show is a staple of PBS, which provides free, educational programming to US televisions. </p> <p>During the debate, Romney said: \"I'm going to stop other things. I like PBS, I love Big Bird. Actually I like you, too. But \u2026 I'm not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for [it].\"</p> <p>This comment initiated waves of social media mockery and <a href=\"http://www.thirteen.org/insidethirteen/2012/10/04/pbs-statement-regarding-october-3-presidential-debate/\">prompted a defensive response from the network</a>. </p> <p>\"As a stated supporter of education, Governor Romney should be a champion of public broadcasting, yet he is willing to wipe out services that reach the vast majority of Americans, including underserved audiences, such as children who cannot attend preschool and citizens living in rural areas,\" PBS said.</p> <p>PBS also noted that most of their funding is provided by local member stations which raise their own money in addition to the federal funding they receive.</p>",
  "<p>He has returned from the dead so many times in recent years that seeing him alive and breathing on stage in his trademark black leather trousers is surely akin to a religious experience. But Johnny Hallyday, the ageing French Elvis, who recently narrowly avoided yet another round of the French media's last rites when he was hospitalised for bronchitis following a back operation that went wrong and cancer rumours, is now to prove he is \"fine\" with a symbolic first UK gig, at the Albert Hall, next week.</p> <p>Hallyday, the US-style French-language rocker who has sold more than 100m albums and played live to 28 million people, has always made a joke of his record labels not pushing him on to the US and UK markets. So it is fitting that as he at last makes it to London 52 years after his first hit single, to a gig expected to be dominated by the city's sizeable French ex-pat community, he has become more than just a pop star but both a national treasure and eternal whipping boy scrutinised for every political and tax move.</p> <p>Hallyday's visit comes just as the London mayor <a href=\"[http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/08/conservative-conference-boris-johnson?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson raised eyebrows in France</a> by describing Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's tax rises for the rich as \"tyranny\", saying he welcomed \"talented French\" escaping to London: \"We say to the people of France, not since 1789 has there been such a terror.\"</p> <p>Hallyday, famous for his close friendship with the former rightwing president Nicolas Sarkozy who he supported in 2007, for years symbolised the exodus of high-earners escaping the French tax system. Although London was never his choice of destination, in 2007 he based himself in Switzerland for tax purposes, but much of his earnings come from the French market and are still subject to tax there. Questioned by journalists after a Los Angeles gig over a \"massive\" tax bill this spring, Hallyday refused to comment. The French actor Christian Clavier, also close to Sarkozy, recently moved to London to escape \"attacks\" and criticism over his friendship with the ex-president although, his entourage stressed, not for tax reasons.</p> <p>Hallyday, 69, has been keen to avoid all references to politics in the run-up to the tour. At Fouquet's restaurant in Paris, where Sarkozy held a much criticised party with millionaire friends after his 2007 election, Hallyday, wearing his uniform black and skulls and crucifixes, told the Guardian prior to the UK gig: \"I don't do politics, it's not my job. I look at the man, I don't look at the party.</p> <p>\"What I want is the president who's going to do the most good for France. Right or left, I don't care. He [Sarkozy] was a friend of mine for a long time \u2026 It can't be easy to be president, even when he tried to do things, there was always a spoke in the wheel, whether from opposite parties or elsewhere. He has tried to do a lot of good things, he's an intelligent man, he's a man who loves his country.\"</p> <p>In January, Hallyday and other singers reportedly had dinner with the-then Socialist candidate Hollande.</p> <p>Hallyday, who regularly features on French celebrity magazine front pages, said he spends most of his time in Los Angeles \"because it's the only place I can push a trolley round a supermarket\".</p> <p>He said there was a role for entertainment in times of crisis. His new album would be \"full of love\" because \"people need love at the moment. In a crisis, they aren't happy. There's unemployment, homelessness, people with not enough to pay for food.\"</p> <p>Hallyday briefly lived in London as a child, when his family, artists and dancers, were working there. He said he had often recorded in London. \"I was very good friends with Jimi Hendrix, I knew Mick Jagger, John Lennon. Rod Stewart is a friend. We'd all record in the different studios and meet for tea.\"</p> <p>Whatever the superlatives about the Albert Hall gigs on 15 and 16 October, Hallyday surely cannot beat Sarkozy's comment on the crowds queuing outside his own London election campaign rally in 2007: \"They haven't seen the like of this since the Beatles.\"</p>",

After months of looking as though he was cruising to victory over Republican challenger Mitt Romney, his poor debate performance has him now searching for fresh attack lines. He needs something to stop the Romney advance, defend his own inept performance and remind America that they are supposed to despise Romney as an evil uncaring financier not see him as a potential new commander-in-chief.</p> <h2>What</h2> <p>What, then, can Obama's crack team of campaigners extract from the Denver debate debacle to use against their newly energised foe? The answer, obviously, is Big Bird.</p> <h2>When</h2> <p>The ad went out Tuesday morning. Kind of. The Obama campaign is not giving much away about the actual on-air use of this 30-second spot designed for TV. This is almost certainly because they are hoping it will go viral on the internet and get tons of free media. After all, the number of times Big Bird has previously become central to America's political discussion can be counted on the fingers of one wing.</p> <h2>Where</h2> <p>Who knows: making this Big Bird ad go viral is one thing, but actually shelling out cash and putting it on air in the battlegrounds of Ohio, Florida and elsewhere \u2026 that might be a stretch.</p> <h2>How</h2> <p>The ad begins seriously enough. \"Bernie Madoff. Ken Lay. Dennis Kozlowski. Criminals. Gluttons of greed,\" says the customary scary voice as portrait snaps of America's greatest corporate villains play across the screen. \"And the evil genius who towered over them? One man has the guts to speak his name,\" the voice states as a silhouette hovers into view on the glassy side of a skyscraper. But hang on \u2026 that shadow does not look like any of the criminals. Or even Mitt Romney.</p> <p>No, its a gigantic and beloved children's TV character from Sesame Street.</p> <p>And here comes Mitt to denounce him. \"Big bird,\" he says, during last week's debate. \"Big Bird!\" he repeats at an event in Iowa back last year. \"Big Bird!\" comes the third and final cry from a speech in Illinois last March. Who knew Big Bird had been such a campaign theme for the Republicans for so long? </p> <p>Suddenly, the yellow fowl itself pops up. \"It's me. Big Bird,\" it squawks. Now the ad can spell out its already heavily telegraphed point: that while Romney is keen on helping big banks deregulate again, he also wants to cut funding to public broadcasting. \"I'm going to stop the subsidy to PBS,\" Romney says. The ad ends with Big Bird going to sleep and the narrator stating: \"Mitt Romney. Taking on our enemies, no matter where they nest.\"</p> <p>The ad is meant to be funny, obviously. And it kind of is. </p> <p>Romney's attack on PBS funding was a ridiculous piece of conservative theatre: highlight a tiny issue to distract people from bigger problems. PBS's slice of public funding is not the problem America faces right now. The prospect of deregulating Wall Street is.</p> <p>But let's step back and look what both sides got out of that Denver debate. Romney got a reinvigorated campaign, a flood of good media and a generous bump in the polls. Obama got a Big Bird attack ad. If you are a Democrat, that's still not funny, no matter how you spin it.</p>",
  "<p>President Obama and Mitt Romney descended on the vital swing state of Ohio on Tuesday as a slew of new polls confirmed that the race has tightened across the country in the wake of last week's fateful televised debate.</p> <p>Exactly four weeks before election day, all eyes are now on Ohio and a handful of other key battleground states where the race for the White House is likely to be won. Local polls <a href=\"http://americanresearchgroup.com/pres2012/OH12.html\">released by Survey USA and the American Research Group</a> have put Romney and Obama within one point of each other among likely voters in Ohio, a stunning reversal of the commanding lead Obama had enjoyed before the TV debate of as much as nine points.</p> <p>There was better news for Obama in a <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/09/cnn-poll-race-tightening-up-in-battleground-ohio/http://\">CNN poll released later on Tuesday</a>, which showed him retaining a four-point, 57%-47% advantage in Ohio. But that still puts the race for the state's 18 electoral college votes much tighter than it was before last week's debate.</p> <p>Other local polls indicated a dramatic closing of the gap between the two candidates even in Michigan and Pennsylvania - two states that had been considered already in the bag for the president. A <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2012/10/08/romneys-strong-debate-performance-erases-obamas-lead/\">national poll by the Pew Research Center</a> has further shaken up the race by giving Romney a four-point lead among likely voters, turning Obama's eight-point lead in September on its head.</p> <p>With the Romney campaign feeling a surge in energy following the televised head-to-head, which Gallup suggested was the biggest victory for a presidential candidate <a href=\"http://news.sky.com/story/994953/gallup-poll-romney-wins-debate-by-50-points\">since it began polling debates</a>, it has begun to pile in resources into Ohio mindful of the fact that no Republican has become president without first winning this state. The former governor of Massachusetts is spending Tuesday and Wednesday in Ohio, following on from his running mate Paul Ryan who was in Swanton, Ohio, on Monday.</p> <p>Unlike his challenger, Obama has alternative routes to a renewed term in the White House that bypass Ohio and its rich crop of the 270 electoral votes needed to triumph on 6 November. But he is taking no chances, travelling to Ohio state university in Columbus on Tuesday to address students.</p> <p>In the five days since his hapless debate performance, which has been almost universally denounced as listless and defensive, Obama has stepped up his attacks on Romney. He has been relentlessly pounding his rival with the accusation that he misled the 70 million viewers of the debate with false information.</p> <p>At a campaign rally in San Francisco on Monday night, Obama said: \"A few nights ago a guy pretending to be Mitt Romney stood on a stage next to me and said he's changing his plan. He is just going to pretend it doesn't exist. 'What $5tr tax cut \u2013 I don't know anything about a $5tr tax cut'.\"</p> <p>On a lighter note, Obama, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/BarackObamadotcom\">backed by a new TV advert</a>, is also ridiculing Romney's threat issued during the debate to cut funding for the public broadcasting TV network PBS and its star Big Bird of Sesame Street. \"For all you moms and kids out there, you should have confidence that finally somebody is cracking down on Big Bird. Elmo has been seen in a white Suburban: he's driving for the border,\" Obama quipped.</p> <p>Apart from the seismic shift in the race indicated by the polls, the election is entering a new and final phase as the two campaigns switch their focus from registering new voters to persuading voters to show up at the polling stations or send in their absentee ballots. Today is the deadline for registering new voters in 16 states and Washington DC. They include three of the nine most hotly-contested states - Colorado, Florida and Ohio.</p> <p>With the presidential campaigns now turning their efforts towards get-out-the-vote, Obama will be hoping that his superior ground operation, built up lovingly over the past two years, will give him a vital edge. In Ohio, for instance, Obama For America has about 100 local offices to Romney's 30.</p> <p>More immediately, the pressure is now on Joe Biden who has the onerous task of undoing the damage caused by his boss in Thursday's single vice-presidential debate. Biden will need to kick their re-election campaign back onto the offensive, without getting overheated and committing gaffes like the one last week in which he referred to America's middle class \"that's been buried the last four years\".</p>",
  "<p>Not speaking in any official capacity here. Not as an NPR host, not as an employee of WNYC, not even as a co-conspirator to undermine American values with liberal bias and too many stories about the third world, modern dance and kelp. I write this, basically, as an earthling with the capacity for reason.</p> <p>The issue is the ongoing funding of public broadcasting, a reliable hot button of the culture wars. <a href=\"http://www.conservativeactionalerts.com/\">Conservative Action Alerts</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"NPR is notorious for being a leftwing propaganda machine. Do you really want your tax dollars going to fund such a media outlet?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>(Suggested answer: <em>NO! That is tyranny!</em>) That sentiment is often accompanied by talk of economic extremis \u2013 that we simply can't afford the expense of informing, educating and culturally enriching our nation. For instance, Senator Jim DeMint (Republican, South Carolina) and Representative Doug Lamborn (Republican, Colorado) have called for the <a href=\"http://cnsnews.com/news/article/demint-and-lamborn-defund-npr-and-pbs\">Corporation for Public Broadcasting to be defunded in 2013</a>. \"While so many Americans are making sacrifices around the country to make ends meet,\" they wrote, \"CPB appears unwilling to do the same.\"</p> <p>Still other critics, notably Newt Gingrich, argue that the private sector (that is, cable) uses the glorious free market to fulfil that mission. The Learning Channel, for instance. The History Channel. National Geographic.</p> <p>Hey, let's begin there. The commercial alternative is a fetching idea that collapses absolutely at once, because the free market is a bit lacking, shall we say, mission-wise, with a tendency toward the lowest common denominator. TLC, the erstwhile Learning Channel, trades in such fare as Half-Ton Killer, a documentary about an obese murder suspect. The History Channel offers Pawn Stars. National Geographic: Family Guns and Women's Prison.</p> <p>Presidential candidate Mitt Romney says he loves Big Bird. He has not weighed in on Women's Prison.</p> <p>As for commercial radio, the biggest stars are Howard Stern, who presides over a junior high school locker-room, and Rush Limbaugh, who is a bigot, a demagogue and a liar. And as for so-called TV news, well, locate me some news on American commercial television, then we can maybe discuss it.</p> <p>Now then: cost. The obvious response to the budgetary argument is that the federal tax dollars \u2013 mainly the $445m allocated to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting \u2013 amount to 0.015 of 1% of the $3.2tn federal budget. Yeah, let's zero out that 1.5/10,000; that'll balance the budget.</p> <p>Congress spends 10 times that sum on <em>itself</em> \u2013 and there are exactly 535 member of Congress (yes, $9m per person.) By way of comparison, about 170 million Americans consume public broadcasting. So you're saying Sesame Street and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/programs/morning-edition/\">Morning Edition</a> are unaffordable luxuries? Here's a thought: shut up.</p> <p>Just a brief word about liberal propaganda. Having spent 25 years in public radio, I have zero doubt that the news staff is overwhelmingly liberal, as is the case in most of the mainstream media. This has to do not with propaganda or \"agenda\", but with the overlapping values of liberalism and journalism. They share suspicion of power, the impulse for reform, the sanctity of the commonweal and a worldview that looks outward, not inward.</p> <p>What is difficult for many to understand is that the overlap does not represent ideology; it represents mentality. It is a way of looking at the world that has a lot to do with engaging many ideas and very, very little to do with doctrine. Why, I remember when there were liberal Republicans \u2013 a category long since banned by the GOP leadership.</p> <p>As for the reporting itself, has Jim DeMint <em>listened</em> to <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/programs/all-things-considered/\">All Things Considered</a>? Could it be any more apolitical? If anything, NPR and <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/\">PBS's NewsHour</a> bend over backwards to be evenhanded \u2013 let's say, for instance, by declining (I'd say \"neglecting\") to call global-warming deniers reactionary scoundrels cynically politicizing science, or by giving wide berth to religious fundamentalists. NPR News is propaganda like water is acid.</p> <p>I'll give the critics this, though. Public broadcasting does appeal to elites \u2013 you know, that cabal of the curious who shamelessly consider ideas, no matter how alien or uncomfortable.</p> <p>But since when is that suspicious behavior? Have the culture wars mutated into Cultural Revolution West, wherein <em>wondering</em> is a subversive act? So grotesquely has this notion of alien elitism metastasized that the majority of candidates for the Republican presidential nomination felt comfortable dismissing the educated class as socialist moles somehow out-of-touch with American values. (Rick Santorum: \"We will never have the elite, smart people on our side, because they believe they should have the power to tell you what to do.\") </p> <p>Once again, <em>unofficially</em>, let me offer this counter-assertion: anybody who promotes less knowledge over more, common wisdom over study, \"tradition\" over education, certainty over reflection, and superstition over science is a fool or worse. If public broadcasting is biased against anti-intellectualism, long live bias. </p> <p>Not that the consumers of public broadcasting are some rarified club of Ivy League pencil-necks. Remember, there are 170 million of us. We're not some hoity-toity minority of cultural snobs. Mitt Romney take note: we are the 55%.</p> <p>But you've heard that before, right? The society has been quarreling over this issue for decades. There remains, though, one constant theme that has not been much questioned: the idea that Americans should not be taxed for media they personally find objectionable.</p> <p>Really? Why?</p> <p>Federal programs aren't opt-in. The law is not a la carte; it's prix fixe. You get a lot of stuff you like and some stuff you don't like, but there is no tax credit for that. In a free society, more or less by definition, the laws and policies reflect a diversity of viewpoints, ideologies and solutions with the advantage to the party in power. And on 15 April, you're billed for your share of the pie.</p> <p>Oh, but you do get a choice of what your taxes pay for. It is called an \"election\". Elected governments govern. You vote them in, and they get to decide how to spend the budget. Note to the Tea Party: that isn't tyranny. </p> <p>Unofficially, it is the very essence of democracy, duh.</p>",
  "<p>These episodes, all from the last 24 hours, demonstrate why I cannot wait for the election to be over:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/mitt-romney-foreign-policy-speech-vmi-obama-virginia-military-institute-libya-2012-10\">Mitt Romney, Monday, in his heralded foreign policy speech</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"This is the struggle that is now shaking the entire Middle East to its foundation. . . . In short, it is a struggle between liberty and tyranny, justice and oppression, hope and despair.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Mitt Romney, yesterday, in the same speech, moments later:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I will deepen our critical cooperation with our partners in the Gulf.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>So to recap: we're in a war for freedom against tyranny, and for justice against oppression - a war which Mitt Romney will fight in close alliance with the regimes of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates.</p> <p>Then we have this, from Romney's foreign policy speech, in which the GOP nominee diagnoses what he sees as the problem in the Middle East:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The attacks against us in Libya were not an isolated incident. They were accompanied by anti-American riots in nearly two dozen other countries, mostly in the Middle East, but also in Africa and Asia. Our embassies have been attacked. Our flag has been burned. Many of our citizens have been threatened and driven from their overseas homes by vicious mobs, shouting 'Death to America.' These mobs hoisted the black banner of Islamic extremism over American embassies on the anniversary of the September 11th attacks.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>And here are his solutions:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>\"Drones and the modern instruments of war are important tools in our fight . . . . I will not hesitate to impose new sanctions on Iran, and will tighten the sanctions we currently have. I will restore the permanent presence of aircraft carrier task forces in both the Eastern Mediterranean and the Gulf region - and work with Israel to increase our military assistance and coordination. . . . I will reaffirm our historic ties to Israel and our abiding commitment to its security - the world must never see any daylight between our two nations. I will deepen our critical cooperation with our partners in the Gulf.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>To summarize: in light of extreme anti-American sentiment, we must drone-bomb more, kill Iranian civilians with sanctions, send more symbols of military occupation to their region, move still closer to Israel (which could only be accomplished by some sort of new surgical procedure to collectively implant us inside of them), and <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/06/14/readout-presidents-call-king-abdullah-saudi-arabia\">even more vigorously support</a> the <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2012/0514/US-resumes-arms-sales-to-Bahrain.-Activists-feel-abandoned\">repressive Gulf regimes</a>. In other words, to solve the problem of anti-American hatred in the region, we must do more and more of exactly that which - quite rationally - <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/06/13/u_s_drones_deeply_unpopular_around_the_world/\">generates</a> that <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/07/13/arabs/\">hatred</a>.</p> <p>Then we come to this, regarding Romney's foreign policy speech, from<br><a href=\"http://andrewsullivan.thedailybeast.com/2012/10/romneys-foreign-policy-offensive.html\">Andrew Sullivan, Monday</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[Spencer] Ackerman points out that Romney's foreign policy sounds a lot like Obama's . . . . 'the policies Romney outlines in his speech differ, at most, superficially from Obama's.'\"</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/08/mitt-romney-delusional-foreign-policy\"><br>Michael Cohen, the Guardian, Monday</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[O]ne would be hard-pressed to find a single substantive difference between what Romney is proposing as a candidate and Obama is actually doing as president.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Michael Cohen, the Guardian, several paragraphs later:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"In the end, Romney doesn't have much of a coherent policy agenda and his critique is wildly off-base. His real problem, though, is that he barely seems to grasp how the world \u2013 and, in turn, American power \u2013 actually works.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.mahablog.com/2012/10/08/quickie-quiz-what-do-the-foreign-policies-of-truman-kennedy-reagan-and-clinton-have-in-common/\">Barbara O'Brien, Monday, reviewing Romney's foreign policy speech</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>\"Please, people, this man must not become President. Must. not. become. President. A Romney administration would be a global catastrophe.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>This was reflective of the two-pronged consensus in Democratic partisan circles yesterday: (1) Romney's foreign policy speech advocated what is basically a replica of what Obama is already doing; (2) when it comes to foreign policy, Romney is a dangerous, bellicose extremist. Both of those propositions are hard to dispute (the second is harder than the first), and the combination of those two precepts - and the logical conclusion it generates - is particularly worth reflecting on today, the third anniversary of the selection of Barack Obama as the 2009 recipient of the Nobel Prize for Peace.</p> <p>Finally we arrive at one of the latest progressive endorsements for Obama's re-election, from <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/170309/why-obama\">Deepak Bhargava in the October 22 issue of The Nation, entitled \"Why Obama?\"</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[H]owever we judge the past four years, it is crucial that we lean into this election without ambivalence, knowing that while an Obama victory will not solve all or even most of our problems, defeat will be catastrophic for the progressive agenda and movement. . . . </p> <p>\"We confront a conservative movement that is apocalyptic in its worldview and revolutionary in its aspirations. It is not an exaggeration to say that this movement wants to roll back the great progressive gains of the twentieth century . . . .[including] the g<em>reat pillars of Social Security</em>, Medicare and Medicaid . . . </p> <p>\"<em>We need to protect and strengthen Social Security</em>, Medicare, Medicaid and other critical programs, particularly those serving the most vulnerable people.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/10/03/162258551/transcript-first-obama-romney-presidential-debate\">Presidential debate, October 3</a>: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"MR. LEHRER: 'Mr. President, do you see a major difference between the two of you on Social Security?'</p> <p>\"PRESIDENT OBAMA: 'You know, I suspect that on Social Security, we've got a somewhat similar position.'\"</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/in-debt-talks-obama-offers-social-security-cuts/2011/07/06/gIQA2sFO1H_story.html\">The Washington Post, July 6, 2011, \"In debt talks, Obama offers Social Security cuts\"</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>\"President Obama is pressing congressional leaders to consider a far-reaching debt-reduction plan that would force Democrats to accept major changes to Social Security and Medicare in exchange for Republican support for fresh tax revenue.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>It's a bit bizarre, to put that generously, to insist that protecting Social Security is one of the prime reasons to dedicate oneself to Obama's re-election when he not only worked hard to cut that program substantially, but himself said just last week that he and his opponent have a \"somewhat similar position\" on that issue.</p> <p>Whatever is awful about the American political process is magnified in the election season, and exponentially intensifies each day as the election approaches. That would all be perfectly tolerable if not for the fact that the election process is 18 months long, or close to 1/3 of each president's term. One of the most effective tactics for keeping the electorate distracted and confused is ensuring that the time when they pay the most attention to the political process is exactly the time when political reality is most obscured.</p>",

  "<p>The Republican presidential campaign has persuaded me. Not to vote for Mitt Romney, God no. They have, however, convinced me of something else I previously considered unthinkable. In some ways, the idea betrays my black nationalist inclinations, but having witnessed the GOP's flailing for the past year and a half as they've tried to mount a campaign to unseat President Obama, I've finally come around.</p> <p>We need a White History Month.</p> <p>For anyone who speaks on issues of race publicly, the idea has long been a joke \u2013 a retort thrown at you from frustrated white folks who believe they are being discriminated against because there doesn't exist a special month set aside to celebrate <em>their</em> racial identity. They cry foul at the notion of Black History Month, Black Entertainment Television, Black Enterprise and everything else with \"black\" in the title \u2013 even, sometimes, going so far as to say these things are racist in nature because their names and missions are \"discriminatory\". It's preposterous, but they counter that they need a White History Month to provide balance and equality.</p> <p>After laughing this off for years, I'm now on the same page.</p> <p>I don't mean White History in the same way we (attempt) to celebrate Black History during February, or Women's History in March. Where these are intended to correct an imbalance in the way history is celebrated from an overwhelming white male perspective, White History Month need not rehash the tales of great white heroism. We need a different approach here.</p> <p>I mean for us to have a White History Month in the way James Baldwin once suggested a White History Week. During <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYka_Tq_mTI\">a speech before the National Press Club in 1986</a>, he presented the idea and was later questioned about the seriousness of his remark. He <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYka_Tq_mTI\">responded</a>: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"I was not joking about White History Week \u2026 I'm serious about that. White Americans really do not not know their history, and that's one of the reasons they're in trouble. And when I suggest White History Week, I'm not making a parody of Black History Week, but I'm suggesting that the truth about this country is buried in the myths that white people have about themselves. These myths have to be excavated and only can be excavated by white people.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Most of the history we learn is built on myths. Even the black history we choose to teach in response to eurocentric learning is centered around myths. But those myths are meant to help a people reclaim a history long denied to them, to instil self-esteem in the face of disempowerment. It may not be exactly ideal, but the rationale is at least noble. The myths of white American history perpetuate oppression and inequality. They instil in white America a false sense of self-imperviousness to facts or logic.</p> <p>When George Washington can't tell a lie, Abraham Lincoln singlehandedly freed the enslaved, FDR lifted the nation out of depression and Ronald Reagan tore down the Berlin Wall with his bare hands \u2026 it's no wonder <a href=\"http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal/2011_06/not_all_of_history_is_open_to030564.php\">Michele Bachmann believes</a> the founding fathers fought to end slavery, <a href=\"http://theminorityeye.com/newt-gingrich-says-teaching-poor-black-kids-to-be-janitors-would-stop-them-p1167-158.htm\">Newt Gingrich thinks</a> poor black children should be janitors to teach them about work ethic, Rick Perry hunts at \"<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/03/texas-governor-rick-perry_n_992712.html\">Niggerhead</a>\" and sees no problem, Republican presidential nominee <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/80097.html\">Mitt Romney can tell \"jokes\"</a> about the president's birth certificate and his campaign co-chair, John Sununu, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUSDD03B7j0\">can refer to the president</a> as \"lazy\" and \"not that bright\".</p> <p>The race-baiting and sabre-rattling that has been on display for the duration of the presidential nomination process \u2013 and now is a part of the national campaign \u2013 reveal not just a disdain for people of color, but also a deep misunderstanding of what it means to be white. Whiteness has its privileges, and among them is that your view of history is through that of the default, the conqueror, the triumphant. And when you can see history through that lens, you don't have to be burdened with understanding the consequences of your triumph from the perspective of those who were stepped on during the conquest.</p> <p>As the racial and ethnic demographics shift in this country, the Republican party has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/10/no-country-for-angry-old-white-men\">become home to an angry white reactionary base </a>that feels their privilege being threatened. What a White History Month could teach them is that this is nothing new, and that even their identity as white people has evolved. White immigrants of the 18th and 19th century, particularly those of eastern European descent, experienced discrimination, <a href=\"http://www.davidroediger.org/working_toward_whiteness.html\">but gradually gained acceptance</a> as they embraced American racism and the white Anglos needed more among their ranks to ensure they retained power.</p> <p>White America needs their myths interrogated, deconstructed and ultimately replaced with a new history altogether. Like Black History Month, a White History Month would be unable to cover all the territory needed to accomplish such a feat in so short a period of time. One would need to do so around the clock, around the calendar.</p> <p>But this is the United States, and we enjoy our pageantry. Let us observe White History Month and use it to rescue white America from itself.</p>",
  "<p>Having now digested much of yesterday's calm and measured punditry on the state of the race for the White House, I wanted to offer my take \u2013 my \"read\", if you will \u2013 on that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/08/romney-gains-lead-obama-poll\">earth-shaking Pew poll</a>, which gives Mitt Romney a four-point lead among likely voters. I concede that others may disagree, but from where I'm standing, this looks like bad news for Barack Obama. Really bad news. If the poll had given the president, say, a 25-point lead, that would have been good news for Democrats. But this is different: it's bad news. </p> <p>If there's one thing I've learned in my years as a leading member of Washington's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Note_%28ABC_News%29\">\"Gang of 500\" opinion-shapers</a>, it's this: going into a two-horse race for the presidency, you don't want to be the guy with less support than the other guy. It's just not a feasible election strategy. Which is why I feel no hesitation in delivering the following warning to Team Chicago. If Obama wants to win on November 6, there's only one remaining path to victory: he must \u2013 absolutely <em>must</em> \u2013 win a majority of the votes in the electoral college.</p> <p>To get a bit wonkish for a moment, the really troubling metric in that Pew survey&#xa0;\u2013 once you drill down beneath the headlines to the raw data-point fundamentals \u2013 is popularity. If Obama can't find a way to clinch more popularity, his other ratings won't much matter. With the arguable exception of the (deeply anomalous) election of 1802, no candidate has ever won the presidency by losing it. The Democrats can't retain control of the White House by relying on Republican votes. The math just isn't there. </p> <p>So it's time for Axlerod, Plouffe et. al. to get real: the narrative is shifting from a horse-race narrative to a narrative about the dominant narrative, in which Obama is no longer gets to define the narrative. Or, perhaps just as importantly, the optics. (BuzzFeed has a must-read deep-dive long-read on this; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\">read the whole thing</a>.) Thursday's debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan will be crucial: the consensus in DC circles is that it'll probably be the only chance for the vice-presidential candidates to meet in a televised head-to-head clash. As one Romney insider revealed to me the other day, the debate is <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/small-college-town-in-central-kentucky-seeks-a-bounce-from-playing-host-to-vp-debate-thursday/2012/10/09/318d1cee-11f5-11e2-9a39-1f5a7f6fe945_story.html\">being held in Kentucky</a>. And if Biden wants to win, he simply doesn't have the luxury of ignoring that fact. He has to go to Kentucky. </p> <p>Memo to Barack Obama: stop reading <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0612/77595.html\">articles in Politico</a> with headlines like \"Memo to Barack Obama\" and focus. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.examiner.com/article/does-barack-obama-really-want-to-lose\">Several</a> of my <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/2012/10/08/does_obama_even_want_to_win_292291.html\">colleagues</a> are now <a href=\"http://washingtonexaminer.com/liberals-fret-is-obama-bored-does-he-even-want-a-second-term/article/2510054#.UHQcLRgtsyw\">openly</a> beginning to wonder whether the president really wants to win. Deep down, they argue, he's lost heart; at the innermost level of his personality, behind the public facade, his faith in the possibility of real change has started to crumble. Their evidence for this psychoanalytic reading is certainly persuasive: all of them watched last week's debate, and some also spent several hours on Twitter. But I'm not ready to agree yet. </p> <p>Don't get me wrong: I'm not disputing Andrew Sullivan's judgment, in a post over at the Daily Dish, that yesterday's poll was <a href=\"http://andrewsullivan.thedailybeast.com/2012/10/did-obama-just-throw-the-entire-election-away.html\">the worst thing that has ever happened</a>. But I still think the president can win this thing. He just needs to get enough votes.</p> <p>And can he? </p> <p>Well, put it this way: this election isn't over yet.</p>",
  "<p>A picture is worth a thousand words. It's a saying that's been rattling around for a hundred years or so. And it's a phrase that rings true for our team each week.</p> <p>We spend some time sifting through images that reflect a story in a unique way. We look for a range of pictures. Sometimes the photos are newsy or playful. Sometimes they're more representational. We work hard to ensure the photos reflect a story in an accurate way.</p> <p>We decided this week on the front-page portrait of Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad after considering several shots of him with the country's clerics behind. Though the clerics and the president told the tale well, the image of a solitary man they're calling the scapegoat for the country's failings seemed somehow more fitting. The story itself, by award-winning Guardian journalist <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2010/nov/24/guardian-journalist-award-iranian-protests\" title=\"\">Saeed Kamali Dehghan</a>, presents Ahmadinejad as a president in some peril.

  "<p>Silvio Berlusconi has signalled that he will not, after all, run for prime minister at the next general election in Italy, due next spring. Instead, he floated the prospect of his successor, Mario Monti, leading the right in the hustings.</p> <p>Speaking about himself in the third person, the media tycoon told one of his own television channels: \"Silvio Berlusconi has always said and continues to say that he is ready to stand aside to allow all moderates to unite in a single force that can face the left together.\" His comment brought to an end \u2013 albeit a somewhat fuzzy end \u2013 four months of uncharacteristic dithering.</p> <p>In June, he was widely assumed to have thrown his hat back into the ring after calling, at a rally of young conservatives, for the electorate to \"give me 51% [of the votes]\". Since then, however, his chances of a triumphant comeback have been severely undermined by his party's involvement in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/25/lazio-governor-resigns-amid-scandal\" title=\"\">a string of corruption scandals, notably in Lazio</a>, the region around Rome, and elsewhere.</p> <p>Polls have repeatedly shown that not even Berlusconi's acknowledged campaigning skills could revive the fortunes of the Freedom People (PdL), the movement he founded on the basis of an alliance between his own followers and former neo-fascists. In a comment for the website of the daily La Stampa, the paper's political correspondent, Ugo Magri, said: \"Judging by the most reliable estimates, if [Berlusconi] were to run he would risk a catastrophic fall [in votes].\"</p> <p>In sharp contrast, support for Monti has grown since the early summer, despite harsh economic measures by his \"technocratic\" government aimed at pulling Italy out of the euro crisis. A poll this month indicated that he was far and away the most popular choice for prime minister, with 43% of Italians favouring a second mandate.</p> <p>Asked if Monti might replace him, Berlusconi told his interviewer: \"I absolutely would not rule out it being Mario Monti. Ever since I've known him he has always been in the liberal camp, so it could easily be Mario Monti.\"</p> <p>The prime minister, who took office last November, has international credibility and the support of many in the financial and business communities. But it remains to be seen whether he would be ready to put himself at the head of a party so discredited by scandal.</p>",
  "<p>Last month the authorities in Cairo whitewashed a mural that had become an international shrine to anti-establishment street art, raising the question of whether graffiti should be protected on the grounds of free speech.</p> <p>The wall in Muhammad Mahmoud Street paid tribute to the martyrs of the revolution, a memorial to hatred of the army and police, and to the rebellious spirit unleashed during and after the uprising. The day after the clean-up, graffiti artists of all persuasions gathered to restore the memorial. They wondered why the authorities were in such a hurry to efface images which for months had attracted tourists and analysts from all over the world. Some suspected that overzealous officials, encouraged by the new Islamist regime, might be tempted to censor pictures supposedly banned by Islam.</p> <p>But it seems that the motives of the newly appointed authorities are much more prosaic. In the past few weeks the new governors appointed by President Mohamed Morsi have been busily cleaning up the streets of Cairo and Alexandria with an enthusiasm only equalled by the widespread disrespect for the authorities that developed under former <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/hosni-mubarak\" title=\"\">President Hosni Mubarak</a>.</p> <p>Mubarak kept social unrest under control by allowing whole swaths of the population to work and find housing with total disregard for the rules. At best such policies fostered indifference to the law, but in many case they fuelled outright hatred of the authorities. How is Egypt's new-found democracy to put down roots with such a legacy?</p> <p>In the absence of any far-reaching reforms the public space has become, since Morsi's election, the focus of a wild drive to patch up appearances. Apparently inspired by some unrealistic desire to turn over a completely new leaf, the Muslim Brotherhood is determined to clean up the streets of Egypt, before even beginning to purge the rotten apparatus of state.</p> <p>Around <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahrir_Square\" title=\"\">Tahrir Square</a>, stripped of its tents, gardeners are planting flowers and palm trees. Meanwhile squads of police track down any errant graffiti and harass the thousands of roaming vendors who clog the city streets. Surely this is an unfortunate initiative in an overpopulated megacity where the informal economy represents more than a third of gross domestic product.</p> <p>On 7 September the police in Alexandria raided the historic used-book market on <a href=\"http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/after-police-raid-state-reconciles-al-nabi-daniel-book-vendors\" title=\"\">Nabi Daniel Street</a>, kicking over stalls, tearing up books and smashing shelves. This operation caused such an outcry that the culture minister in person expressed his disapproval.</p> <p>As part of their cleaning frenzy the Brothers have also instructed several groups of well-meaning youths to deal with the heaps of rubbish which block the streets of towns all over Egypt. This cosmetic initiative drew sarcastic comments from the rag trade, which has been struggling to cope with the problem for decades.</p> <p>The victims of the police clampdown are not fooled by the authorities' dreams of flowerbeds and superficial tidying. Skulking in the entrances to buildings, street vendors are quick to voice their resentment. \"To restore confidence the government should start by making gifts to people, rather than depriving them of the little they have,\" said one trader struggling to keep hold of his goods. \"Apart from the rubbish,\" he added, stumbling over a heap of junk.</p> <p>Any hopes of graffiti being legalised seem extremely unlikely, even if on the day after the destruction of the Muhammad Mahmoud mural the prime minister, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesham_Qandil\" title=\"\">Hisham Qandil</a>, expressed reservations, condemning the whitewash and encouraging street artists to produce new graffiti on Tahrir Square \"true to the spirit of the revolution\".</p> <p>The response was almost immediate. \"If you change your trousers without having a wash you get a rash\", read the message on a wall in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talaat_Harb_Street\" title=\"\">Talaat Harb Street</a>. And in Muhammad Mahmoud Street itself there was a face poking out its tongue in defiance and saying: \"Erase it again, you cowardly regime\".</p> <p><em>\u2022 This article appeared in the </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/weekly\" title=\"\">Guardian Weekly</a><em>, which incorporates material from Le Monde</em></p>",
  "<p>An Islamist militia suspected of the killing of America's Libya ambassador is being blockaded in a remote, forested region in the east of the country, but army commanders say they lack the firepower to capture the militiamen.</p> <p>The Islamist Ansar al-Sharia fled to the hilly Jebel Akhdar \u2013 Green Mountains \u2013 region after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/22/libyan-protesters-militia-benghazi?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">protesters ejected its members from their bases in Benghazi and Derna in late September</a>. Last week they ambushed a police checkpoint near the small town of Susah, killing four officers.</p> <p>\"They have 150 to 200 men and 17 vehicles, Toyotas and four-by-fours,\" said the army taskforce commander, Colonel Hamid Hassi. \"These people are very dangerous.\"</p> <p>Libyan commanders say the militiamen have returned to the area from where they mounted an Islamist resistance against the former dictator, Muammar Gaddafi, 20 years ago. \"Gaddafi tried to fight these guys here, he had 30,000 soldiers, in 1992, and he could not catch them,\" Hassi said. \"We need help from the United Nations or the Europeans.\"</p> <p>Infantry units backed by pickup trucks carrying anti-aircraft guns have been set up in blocking positions on the coastal highway at Susah and Derna.</p> <p>In between are 40 miles of some of Libya's wildest and most beautiful country, a landscape of forests and twisting valleys famed as the hideout of Saint Mark.</p> <p>\"You need good equipment to go in there,\" Hassi told the Guardian. \"We asked the chief of staff to send us planes and helicopters, but we received nothing.\"</p> <p>Drones have been heard in the night skies in the region, prompting <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/03/world/africa/us-said-to-be-preparing-potential-targets-tied-to-libya-attack.html\" title=\"\">speculation that the US is poised to take action</a>, four weeks after ambassador Chris Stevens and three diplomats were killed in an attack on the US consulate in Benghazi.</p> <p>Pressure for decisive action is mounting in Washington before a congressional hearing on Wednesday to examine the circumstances of the attack, and whether diplomats ignored prior warnings of jihadist violence.</p> <p>The Republican presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, on Monday linked the consulate attack to al-Qaida, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/08/romney-obama-failed-leadership-middle-east\" title=\"\">questioned whether the Obama administration had the resolve to deal with it</a>.</p> <p>Libya's government is for the moment in disarray following the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/07/libyan-government-disarray-mustafa-abushagur\" title=\"\">sacking by parliament of prime minister-elect Mustafa Abushagur on Sunday after his proposed cabinet was rejected</a>.</p> <p>Further west, Egypt and India have begun trying to evacuate nationals from the town of Beni Walid, a former Gaddafi stronghold now surrounded by government forces demanding the handover of men accused of murdering a prominent revolutionary. Tanks and artillery surround the town.</p> <p>The murder of the four policemen has shocked the small town of Susah, home of the ancient ruins of the Greek settlement of Apollonia, and local people have dubbed the day of the killings \"Black Wednesday\". \"This is a small place, people are very upset,\" said one resident, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals.</p>",
  "<p>The storm clouds gathering over President Obama's bid for re-election have thickened with the release of a new poll from the respected Pew Research Center that gives Mitt Romney a four-point lead among likely voters.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2012/10/08/romneys-strong-debate-performance-erases-obamas-lead/\">Pew survey of 1,511 adults </a>was carried out over four days starting on the day after the first presidential TV debate last week. Its findings \u2013 including evidence that the Republican nominee is making dramatic headway with female voters, young people and those in the heartlands of the mid-west \u2013 appear to confirm that Obama's listless performance at the debate, and by contrast Romney's strong showing, has translated into a powerful political force.</p> <p>\"We found a dramatic shift from a significant Obama lead to a slight Romney edge among likely voters \u2013 and this is the first evidence that the debate appears to have impacted the race,\" said Carroll Doherty, Pew Research Center's associate director.</p> <p>The poll records Obama and Romney on a direct tie of 46% each among registered voters, with Romney taking the lead by 49% to 45% among likely voters. The latter figure marks a striking turn-around in Romney's fortunes: last month the Pew poll marked him behind by eight points among likely voters.</p> <p>Romney's widely lauded performance at the debate in front of almost 70 million viewers appears to have had a particularly favourable impact on several groups that had been assumed to be unassailable strongholds for Obama. Among likely female voters, the two contenders for the White House now stand neck-and-neck on 47%, in contrast to a month ago when Romney trailed by a whopping 18 points.</p> <p>Support among voters under 50 has bounced in the past month for Romney by no fewer than 10 points, from 39% to 49%, and he now even leads among this demographic over Obama on 46%.</p> <p>The one feature that appears to be driving this sharp improvement in Romney's standing was the debate. Two-thirds of registered voters in the poll said that they thought Romney did the better job during Wednesday's televised head-to-head, with only 20% backing Obama.</p> <p>What is not clear is whether a post-debate bounce for Romney will last as the race for the presidency enters its final month. The latest tracking poll from Gallup <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/157907/romney-narrows-vote-gap-historic-debate-win.aspx\">has the two candidates on a 47% tie</a>.</p> <p>One factor that could prove significant in terms of the final days of the campaign is that, in the Pew poll, the ground soldiers of the Republican party appear to have been energised by Romney's perceived debate victory. Some 67% of Romney's supporters said they now back him strongly, up from 56% in September.</p> <p>Engagement is one aspect of Romney's candidacy that the Republicans have been struggling with all year, including through the primary season when he was regarded with widespread suspicion by staunch conservatives as a result of the liberal policies \u2013 including healthcare reform \u2013 that he pursued while governor of Massachusetts. Romney needs a revitalised base if he is to wage an energetic get-out-the-vote ground operation come November.</p> <p>\"This is perhaps the most important aspects of the results, that Republicans come out of the TV debate very energised,\" Doherty said.</p> <p>The poll will give Obama's top re-election advisers, led by David Axelrod, food for thought on how they are faring in terms of owning political issues. On the single most important policy area, the economy, Romney shows a 13-point lead among vital swing voters when asked who would do the better job on the job situation (Romney polled 37% to Obama's 24%).</p> <p>The Republican candidate is still seen as favouring the rich, but he is now given more credit by voters for policies that would help middle-class Americans, up from 41% in July to 49% today.</p> <p>In other policy areas, Romney has effectively closed the gap with the president over Medicare and health care, and is just four points behind Obama on foreign policy having lagged by 15 points last month.</p> <p>The Pew poll, conducted nationally, does not give a deep insight into what's happening in the vital swing states of Ohio, Florida, Virginia and elsewhere. The impact of the TV debate on these battle grounds will have to wait until state-wide polls are published.</p> <p>It does though give one intriguing finding, showing a six-point lead for Romney in the Midwest.</p> <p>The signs that Romney is making a spirited rally in the wake of his morale-boosting success on primetime TV will pile on the pressure on Joe Biden. He faces his only vice-presidential debate with Romney's running mate, Paul Ryan, on Thursday night, with two further presidential debates following later in the month.</p>"
