  "<h2>Central bankers</h2> <p><strong>Alan Greenspan, chairman US Federal Reserve 1987-2006</strong><br>A disciple of libertarian icon Ayn Rand, Greenspan became chairman of the Fed just in time to save the global economy from the 1987 stock market crash from becoming a full-blown disaster. He went on preside over the boom years of the 90s and lead the US economy through the aftermath of the September 11 attacks and was widely referred to as an \"oracle\" and \"the maestro\".</p> <p>But Greenspan's super-low interest rates and consistent opposition to regulation of the multitrillion-dollar derivatives market are now widely blamed for causing the credit crisis. Under Greenspan's tenure the derivatives market went from barely registering to a $500 trillion industry, despite billionaire investor Warren Buffett warning that they were \"financial weapons of mass destruction\".</p> <p>His rock-bottom rates encouraged Americans to load up on debt to buy homes, even when they had no savings, no income and no job prospects.</p> <p>These so-called sub-prime borrowers were the cannon fodder for the biggest boom-bust in US history. The housing collapse brought the global economy to its knees.</p> <p>He was given an honorary knighthood in 2002 for his \"contribution to global economic stability\", but in 2008, at a Congressional hearing investigating the causes of the financial crisis, Greenspan finally admitted he \"made a mistake in presuming\" that financial firms could regulate themselves.</p> <p>\"You found that your view of the world, your ideology was not right, it was not working?\" Henry Waxman, the committee chairman, said.</p> <p>\"Absolutely, precisely,\" Greenspan replied. \"You know, that's precisely the reason I was shocked, because I have been going for 40 years or more with very considerable evidence that it was working exceptionally well.\"</p> <p>After he quit the Fed, in 2006, Greenspan joined Pimco, the world's largest bond investor, as a special consultant. Pimco's co-founder Bill Gross said Greenspan had helped make the firm \"billions of dollars'' in his role as a consultant.</p> <p>Gross said Greenspan's \"brilliance\" was a \"big money saver for us''. \"He's made and saved billions of dollars for Pimco already,'' Gross said in 2008.He has also advised Deutsche Bank and hedge fund billionaire John Paulson.</p> <p>Greenspan has also found time to criticise current Fed chairman Ben Bernanke's programme of quantitative easing. \"I've stayed away from commenting on Fed policy,\" he said on US TV earlier this month. \"I will say this, however, that the data do show that the expansion of assets has had very little impact on the economy, for an important reason, that we've created a major increase in the asset side of the Fed balance sheet and a very large trillion and a half increase in excess reserves.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394252632\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Business competitions/pictures/2009/1/26/1232967487331/Mervyn-King-001.jpg\" alt=\"Mervyn King\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mervyn King Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England</strong></p> <p>At his first meeting chairing the Bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) interest rates were cut to an historic postwar low of 3.5%. King's ambition as governor was to make the Bank \"boring\". If only that had been the case.</p> <p>He was slow to react to the crisis and initially refused to follow Greenspan in pumping cash into the system. The Treasury select committee (TSC) said he should have noticed that the housing bubble was becoming unstable and should have been \"more pro-active\" to damp it down.</p> <p>Just the other week King finally admitted that the financial crisis was the result of \"major mistakes\" by policymakers and not just the fault of greedy bankers.</p> <p>At the government's Global Investment Conference in London in the buildup to the Olympics he said: \"We saw this going into the crisis, we kept meeting at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), but we did nothing to solve it collectively, and I don't think that this was a problem that could have been solved individually.\"</p> <p>More recently, King had to face the TSC to explain why the Bank failed to spot the Libor interest rate-fixing scandal that pre-dated the credit crunch and last month Bob Diamond stepped down as chief executive of Barclays after King let it be known Diamond no longer had the confidence of the Bank.</p> <p>In the shake-up of regulation that followed the financial meltdown, the governor of the Bank of England has emerged with more power than ever. However, King is due to stand down next summer, with former cabinet secretary Sir Gus O'Donnell and deputy governor Paul Tucker the favourites to replace him.</p> <h2>Politicians</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394252633\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Business competitions/pictures/2009/1/26/1232967669577/Bill-Clinton-001.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Clinton\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bill Clinton Photograph: Mary Altaffer/AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mary Altaffer/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Bill Clinton, former US president</strong></p> <p>Politicians' current plan to help prevent another financial crisis is to ringfence banks' risky \"casino banking\" divisions from the more pedestrian high street banking departments. 13 years ago Clinton repealed the Glass-Steagall Act, which had done just that. Clinton's move, which came after fierce lobbying from bankers, heralded the birth of superbanks and primed the sub-prime pump.</p> <p>He also signed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, which exempted credit-default swaps from regulation. Around the same time Clinton also beefed up President Carter's 1977 Community Reinvestment Act \u2013 forcing lenders to take a more sympathetic approach to poor borrowers trying to get on the housing ladder.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394252634\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Business competitions/pictures/2009/1/26/1232967696022/Gordon-Brown-001.jpg\" alt=\"Gordon Brown\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gordon Brown Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Gordon Brown, former prime minister</strong></p> <p>Brown's big boast as chancellor was that he had \"abolished Tory boom and bust\".

He has \"no plans to endorse, at least not at present,\" the spokesman added.</p> <p>The former president has written a book, Decision Points, about the 14 biggest decisions of his presidential career.

Last week Weill said: \"What we should probably do is go and split up investment banking from banking, have banks be deposit takers, have banks make commercial loans and real-estate loans and have banks do something that's not going to risk the taxpayer dollars, that's not too big to fail.\"</p> <p>Weill added: \"The world changed with the collapse of the housing market and the real-estate bubble \u2026 so I don't think it's right anymore (to have huge investment and retail banking combines).\"</p> <h2>Wall Street/Bankers</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394252637\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Business competitions/pictures/2009/1/26/1232967449772/Abi-Cohen-001.jpg\" alt=\"Abi Cohen\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abi Cohen Photograph: Martin Godwin</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Abby Cohen, Goldman Sachs senior strategist</strong></p> <p>Bear market?

  "<p>As a tribute to the vanity and sleaze inherent in France's political class, a solid bronze statue of supermodel-turned-first-lady Carla Bruni takes some beating. The one <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2012/08/02/nogent-sur-marne-statue-carla-bruni-sarkozy-installation_n_1731509.html\" title=\"\">which has just been delivered</a> to the Paris suburb of Nogent-sur-Marne is uniquely poignant \u2013 not just because it is oversized and expensive, but because it portrays the multimillionaire heiress as a labourer. Turin-born Carla is depicted as a <em>plumassi\u00e8re</em>, one of the mainly Italian factory workers who slaved away in sweatshops producing fancy feathers for the super rich. The idea was that even a former runway queen with an easily earned fortune and palatial homes across France could empathise with fellow immigrants from the old country.</p> <p>Jacques Martin, the mayor of Nogent, thought up this monumental deceit when Carla's husband, Nicolas Sarkozy, was president of France. Martin, an ambitious member of Sarkozy's conservative UMP party, wanted the taxpayer to pick up the \u20ac80,000 (\u00a363,000) bill for the statue, but his career move fell flat when Sarkozy not only lost his re-election bid in May but was promptly implicated in a number of corruption inquiries. Within a few days of losing his presidential immunity from prosecution, police rolled up at the Sarkozy-Bruni Paris mansion and at two offices linked to the humiliated politician.</p> <p>The couple disappeared on the night before the raids, and have not been seen nor heard from for more than a month. Rumours suggest they have been seeking sanctuary with billionaire friends, including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/25/nicolas-sarkozy-party-split-ump\" title=\"\">the king of Morocco</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/07/04/nicolas-sarkozy-paul-desmarais_n_1649162.html\" title=\"\">Canadian tycoon</a> to whom Sarkozy awarded the L\u00e9gion d'honneur. A major allegation against Sarkozy is that he accepted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/03/nicolas-sarkozy-home-raided-police\" title=\"\">brown envelopes</a> stuffed with illegal cash over sumptuous dinners at the home of Liliane Bettencourt, the l'Or\u00e9al heiress and France's richest woman. She, in turn, was said to have been granted massive tax breaks by the Sarkozy government, including being able to hide much of her fortune in Swiss accounts.</p> <p>The Sarkozys' decision to go to ground contrasts magnificently with the opulent lifestyle the once publicity obsessed pair showed off when they were in the Elys\u00e9e Palace. Private jets with made-to-order bread stoves, daily fresh flower bills of more than \u20ac750, Vanity Fair cover shoots and even a CD release by the self-styled \"rock chick\" first lady were all part of a presidential package which so disgusted ordinary French people that they ended up replacing Sarkozy with the most overtly leftwing government for decades.</p> <p>Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the new socialist president, has a massive majority in the French parliament precisely because of the Marie-Antoinette-style high-living enjoyed by Carla and her husband. Sarkozy denies all wrongdoing in connection with three main corruption and <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b9418d86-f650-11df-846a-00144feab49a.html\" title=\"\">arms sale</a> scandals, but the growing bundle of evidence being compiled by investigating judges point towards the kind of criminal trial which last year saw Jacques Chirac <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/15/jacques-chirac-guilty-corruption\" title=\"\">become the first president</a> in the history of modern France to be convicted of fraud.</p> <p>Is the 6ft plus Nogent statue something the French should want to show off? This folly has now been paid for by a private firm of property speculators, ensuring it is a complete symbol of the greed and insensitivity that characterised the Sarkozy years. Thanks to France's privacy laws and its scandalously toothless and reverential media, very little has been made of the former head of state's legal problems. This sturdy and lasting testament of what the Sarkozys really represent would redress the balance. The Carla bronze may be to no one's taste, but that is what makes it so eminently appropriate.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 August to clarify the meaning of the third sentence of the final paragraph</p>",
  "<p>The banners, T-shirts and handwritten posters said it all. \"China! Hands off Vietnam!\" read one. \"Shame on you, bastard neighbour,\" said another. \"Stop escalating, invading the East Sea of Vietnam,\" a third declared.</p> <p>As the protesters weaved their way through the crowded streets of Hanoi, past the peeling colonial villas and upmarket shops selling stereos and Versace, they charged towards the Chinese embassy, where they hoped to make a stand against what they call \"China's constant aggression\".</p> <p>\"I hate China!\" said one fortysomething protester, his voice hoarse from shouting slogans. \"Germany invaded Poland during the second world war, now China wants to do the same to Vietnam. History may repeat itself if the international community is not made aware of China's bullying.\"</p> <p>From government offices to the streets of Vietnam, tensions between Beijing and Hanoi have mounted in recent weeks over what China calls the South China Sea and Vietnam the East Sea, an area where vast deposits of oil and gas, important international shipping routes and fishing rights are of interest not just to Beijing and Hanoi, but also to the Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei.</p> <p>But last month's <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/22/vietnamese-protesters-chinese-aggression\" title=\"\">protesters had only China on their mind</a>. After detaining a group of Vietnamese fishermen near disputed islands this year, Beijing announced that the state-backed China National Offshore Oil Corporation was seeking bids for oil exploration in what Vietnam deems its own sovereign waters.</p> <p>It also declared Sansha City \u2013 on tiny Yongxing in the Paracel islands, which Vietnam lays claim to \u2013 China's newest municipality. The anti-China protest was the third of its kind in Hanoi in one month. \"The territorial ambition of China is a common threat \u2013 not only for the Philippines or Vietnam but for countries all over the world,\" said leading economist Le Dang Doanh, a former government adviser who recently signed an <a href=\"http://eyedrd.org/2012/05/vietnamese-intelligentsia-supports-the-philippines-in-scarborough-shoal-standoff.html\" title=\"\">open letter </a>calling for China to abandon its \"absurd maritime claims\" in the region. \"China's territorial claims are now bigger than China itself.\"</p> <p>Hanoi, 125 miles from the Chinese border, knows it must play a delicate game. Trade between the two countries reached an estimated $40bn last year, and analysts say that ties between the authoritarian, one-party states are considerably closer than either government would like to admit.</p> <p>The seeming standoff has pushed the US into the game, with recent visits by the secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, and the defence secretary, Leon Panetta, highlighting America's interest in its former foe. Panetta's visit to Cam Ranh bay, a US naval base during the Vietnam war, sparked particular curiosity over the US's intentions to \"protect key maritime rights for all nations in the South China Sea\" as it moves to deploy 60% of its naval ships to the Pacific by 2020.</p> <p>Carlyle Thayer, a Vietnam expert at the Australian defence academy, said Vietnam was likely to maintain its sovereignty by co-operating \u2013 but not aligning itself \u2013 with the US, but warned the situation in the South China Sea could worsen before it improved. \"Most likely an incident will occur from a misadventure of two opposite boats trying to be in the same place at the same time,\" he said. \"At the moment there's enough control [on both sides] but the analysis is that a lot of China's agencies are acting independently, and the central government is having a hard time asserting authority \u2026 the problem is that [neither country's] crisis management techniques are very good.\"</p> <p>The protests in Hanoi come at a time of uncertainty over Vietnam's political and social future. Its economy has followed a remarkable trajectory from colonialism and communism through to the <em>doi-moi</em> (\"socialist-oriented market economy\") capitalism of the 1990s and beyond. Art-deco villas have been razed for multi-storey office blocks, and gaudy mansions dwarf the shady avenues of Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi, where men in slacks and women in short shorts and stilettos skittle past in glossy Mercedes and 4x4 BMWs.</p> <p>Here, the rich have become so rich that a Vietnamese businessman <a href=\"http://www.live-pr.com/en/williams-amp-williams-sells-smallest-town-r1049427156.htm\" title=\"\">recently purchased an entire American town</a> for sale in Wyoming. But Vietnam is running a huge trade deficit with China ($1.85bn in the first two months of the year alone) and its three million-member Communist party is struggling to maintain control over its population of 90 million, 70% of whom were born after 1975, and one-third of whom have internet access.</p> <p>Protesters are not just angry about China's territorial ambitions, but about the gaping rich-poor divide, increasing accounts of police brutality, widening crackdowns on dissent, and growing numbers of land evictions and human rights abuses. Reporters without Borders declared Vietnam an \"enemy of the internet\" as a decree aimed at making it illegal to post anonymously online means that bloggers particularly are under attack. Facebook is blocked, as are many blogs, and activists claim emails, phone calls and whereabouts are routinely monitored. The <a href=\"http://cpj.org/\" title=\"\">Committee to Protect Journalists</a> cites Vietnam as the fourth-worst jailer of journalists in the world. \"Vietnam really is the new Burma,\" said Phil Robertson of Human Rights Watch.</p> <p>\"We're seeing more of a crackdown on freedom of expression, a growing lawlessness in terms of the way police interact with people, a continued effort to go after prominent bloggers, to identify activists and jail dissidents. They're trying to prevent any Arab spring-type event where a mixture of information on the internet combined with people being angry and protesting ignites into something more. It's very embarrassing for Vietnam, because previously they were the influential ones giving advice to Burma, which was the basket-case.\"</p> <p>Now that Burma is no longer a pariah \u2014 thanks to the election of Aung San Suu Kyi to parliament and a slew of reforms initiated by reformist President Thein Sein \u2014 the shining star that was once Vietnam has waned considerably, says one local analyst. \"Foreign direct investment is flowing into Burma and declining in Vietnam. The government knows it is losing credibility. Vietnam allowed its private sector to develop, but it did not reform its political system. It was a fatal mistake.\"</p> <p>Dissident lawyer Le Quoc Quan, one of Vietnam's most prominent human rights activists who has been repeatedly jailed and beaten for his democracy efforts, said Vietnam was fighting a losing battle. \"More people know more about their rights, so the more they fight for their rights, [the] more repression, more arrests,\" he said. \"But an optimistic sign is that people are not afraid.\"</p> <p>While it is hoped a diplomatic resolution over the South China Sea will soon be reached \u2013 the Association of Southeast Nations agreed last week to a \"code of conduct\" that may see negotiations begin with China in September \u2013 it is just as likely that tension will continue. \"The problem of China and Vietnam has been a problem for 2,000 years,\" says Le Dang Doanh. \"If China keeps up the aggression, one million [Vietnamese] will take to the streets to protest. You'll see.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 7 August 2012.

  "<p>We all know him: the popular guy at the party who schmoozes with everyone. He seems to have it all. Yet, the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/\">\"popular guy\" is also the loneliest guy</a>. He has no true friends, no one in whom he can confide. It turns out that our character's social network is a mile wide, but only an inch deep.</p> <p>How is the 2012 election like the popular guy? Well, it turns out that the electoral college is fertile ground for this width v depth analogy. A candidate may win a great many states by a tiny margin and thus appear to have won a large victory even though he was actually quite close to being defeated: the mile-wide, inch-deep win.</p> <p>Jack Kennedy's <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1960&amp;off=0&amp;f=1\">1960 win</a> is a perfect example. He won 303 electoral votes or 56.4% of the available 537. That would imply an ample cushion of victory, but JFK would have fallen short of the necessary 50%+1 of electoral votes if the margin in each state had shifted by only 0.52 percentage points more toward Republican Richard Nixon.</p> <p>George W Bush's <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2004&amp;off=0&amp;f=1\">2004 victory</a> is a great example of the opposite scenario. He only won 286 electoral votes, or 53.2% of the available 538; and if Bush had lost Ohio, he would have lost the election. Yet, he won Ohio by the relatively comfortable margin of 2.1 percentage points. Bush's victory was therefore deeper than the raw number of electoral votes he won implied.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/2012_elections_electoral_college_map_no_toss_ups.html\">electoral map</a> this year gives Democrats the jumping-joys and Republicans the willies. Newsweek/Daily Beast columnist Michael Tomasky <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/08/04/michael-tomasky-on-the-possible-coming-obama-landslide.html\">puts it</a> best, as \"The (Possible) Coming Obama Landslide\". All polling aggregators give President Obama an edge over Mitt Romney in the electoral college. In fact, if the polling average of every state were correct, then as of today, Barack Obama would win 332 electoral votes, or 61.7% of the available 538.</p> <p>The question, though, is just how deep is Obama's lead? To know the answer, we have to have an idea of which states will decide the election.</p> <p>Most analysts would agree that the states with the great chance of being \"Florida 2000\" are Colorado, Florida, Iowa, New Hampshire, Ohio, and Virginia. All were states won at least once by George W Bush, but were then carried in 2008 by Barack Obama. Obama leads in all of them currently. But how big are those leads?</p> <p>I've taken a median of the polling data for each state for all non-partisan polls since 1 June. I use the median to control for outlier polls and reference back to 1 June because most experts agree the race hasn't changed much since then. If a pollster has taken more than one poll in the state, I use the most recent data available.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394351901\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/8/6/1344272706399/Battlegroundmedians_220.jpg\" alt=\"Battleground state median polling\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>Table: Harry Enten/guardiannews.com</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It turns out that Obama's leads are really not that deep. If the margin shifted a point and a half away from Obama in Florida, Iowa, and Virginia, he would be at 284 electoral votes, or 52.8%. Few would call that a \"blowout\".</p> <p>An Obama supporter might reason that it's no big deal if Obama loses a percentage point in Florida, because he'll still hold onto Iowa. Maybe, but states' presidential support tend to move in unison with each other. That's why <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100807112912im_/http://www.stat.columbia.edu/%7Ecook/movabletype/mlm/2000_2004.png\">uniform swings</a> referenced to changes in the national vote do a fine job of predicting changes in states' support. If Romney gains in Florida, he'll probably gain in Iowa and Virginia. Put another way, state-by-state presidential results are <a href=\"http://blogs.middlebury.edu/presidentialpower/2012/08/05/an-electoral-landslide-for-obama/\"><em>not</em> independent of each other</a>.</p> <p>Thus the key state, according to the median poll data, is Ohio. If Obama wins Ohio, he will almost certainly win re-election. If Romney takes it, he is in very good position.</p> <p>Ohio seems, on the one hand, the perfect state for Mitt Romney. Romney's doing very well <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jun/08/obama-problem-white-working-class-americans\">nationally</a> with white working-class voters. In Ohio, 50% of <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/polls/#OHP00p1\">2008 voters</a> were whites who lacked a college education \u2013 well above the <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/polls/#USP00p1\">national demographic of 39%</a>.</p> <p>Yet, Romney's fallen back in Ohio. A one-time lead in a number of state polls has become a 3-point deficit in the median. The <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/241755-obama-takes-the-lead-in-critical-ohio\">auto industry</a> is recovering in the state; some <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/blog/electionate/105201/ohio-the-place-where-bain-might-be-paying\">might argue</a> that Ohio is a state where the Obama campaign's attacks on Romney's Bain Capital record seemed to be working.</p> <p>I'd point out, instead, that Romney simply hasn't consolidated the Republican base. As <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/blog/electionate/105511/obama-ohio-romney-polls\">Nate Cohn notes</a>, there is \"good reason to believe that Romney can make the jump to 46 or 47% without much difficulty, and that would effectively inaugurate a dead heat in the Buckeye State.\"</p> <p>The median poll in Ohio, which was a <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2012/06/obama-leads-romney-by-3-in-ohio.html#more\">Public Policy Polling survey</a> taken from mid June, illustrates this comeback potential well. Obama captured 83% of Democrats, but Romney only held 79% of Republicans. Merely bumping Romney up to an equal 83% support among Republicans cuts Obama's 3-point lead in the PPP poll in half. </p> <p>Whether Romney will actually do any of this catching-up, and win, is a different matter. It again comes down to a question of depth. Are those voters who are normally reachable for a Republican totally against Romney? Or are they just wary of him? If you can answer that question, you'll know whether Romney stands a chance in November.</p>",
  "<p>The cross-border <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/05/attack-across-egypt-israel-border?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">attack on Israel by militants</a> in the Egyptian Sinai was a highly ambitious and well-planned assault that has left Israeli authorities more certain than ever that the area is out of control \u2013 but also with a major dilemma over how to respond.</p> <p>A serious attack, potentially resulting in the deaths of many Israelis living in small communities near the border, was narrowly averted, according to senior officials.</p> <p>After killing about 15 Egyptian security personnel at a base in the border town of Rafah, the militants used a pickup truck filled with explosives to breach the Egypt-Israel border, then drove an armoured vehicle more than a mile into Israel before being struck by a missile fired from an Israeli military plane. Up to eight militants were killed.</p> <p>They were heavily armed and, significantly, were wearing suicide belts, thought to indicate a strong ideological motivation for the attack. A statement from the Egyptian military said 35 militants were involved and \"elements from the Gaza Strip\" aided the attack by firing rockets, suggesting co-ordination between Palestinian and Sinai militants.</p> <p>Israel's alarm at the mounting chaos and violence in Sinai has been growing steadily since their ally, the former president Hosni Mubarak, was ousted in the Egyptian revolution 18 months ago. As well as three serious cross-border attacks \u2013 one last August in which eight Israelis were killed, one in June in which an Israeli construction worker died and the one on Sunday evening \u2013 a pipeline supplying gas to Israel has been blown up more than a dozen times.</p> <p>The impoverished and neglected Sinai region has been a breeding ground for resentment and radicalism among its largely Bedouin inhabitants for years. But Israel says it now detects the presence of \"global jihad\" militants and groups, some loosely connected to al-Qaida.</p> <p>\"There is a problem with Bedouin tribes drifting towards a fundamentalist Islamic ideology, making themselves part of the Islamic jihad movement, by which I mean a loose network of small terror organisations trying to fight the current order,\" said Major General Dan Harel, former deputy chief of staff for the Israel Defence Forces.</p> <p>One of the difficulties Israel faces is intelligence-gathering across the border.</p> <p>\"Israel has a good hold on what's happening in Gaza\" as a result of close monitoring via aerial drones and human intelligence, said Yaakov Katz, a journalist specialising in defence and military affairs. \"Sinai is much more difficult.\"</p> <p>Even so, Israeli military intelligence had advance indication that an attack was imminent and responded swiftly when it was launched, thwarting an extremely serious incident, according to the defence minister, Ehud Barak. In Gaza, such intelligence would have resulted in a pre-emptive strike on a militant cell planning an attack \u2013 an option simply not available across the Egyptian border.</p> <p>Assuming that Israel shared its intelligence with its Egyptian counterparts, the Israeli military distrusts its neighbour's willingness to take effective action to rein in militants in Sinai and exert a grip on the area. That may now change.</p> <p>\"I hope this will be a wake-up call for Egypt regarding the necessity to be sharp and efficient on their side,\" said Barak while touring the site of the attack on Monday morning.</p> <p>Cairo cannot afford to ignore the loss of more than a dozen Egyptian soldiers. According to Katz, Mohammed Morsi, the new Muslim Brotherhood president of Egypt, \"is going to have to deal with this. Up until now he could pretend this wasn't a big problem. But this could be a turning point. Is [the government] going to take control or allow [the region] to remain a safe haven for al-Qaida and global jihad types?\"</p> <p>And, indeed, within hours of the attack, Morsi was pledging to \"impose full control\" on Sinai, later sending helicopter gunships to join a security sweep of the area.</p> <p>Israel, however, does not like to outsource its security \u2013 and does not usually shy away from taking action on foreign territory to protect its citizens and interests.</p> <p>But this is a delicate situation. Since Israel and Egypt signed a peace treaty in 1979, Sinai has been a demilitarised zone, with tight restrictions on troops on the ground. Israel is unlikely to take steps which could threaten the treaty's durability, especially in the context of its concerns over the post-revolution government's commitment to the accord.</p> <p>\"Israel has strategic interests in keeping the peace treaty. This is why we're not attacking on Egyptian soil and instead conveying alerts we have to the Egyptian authorities in the hope they will deal with it,\" Harel said.</p> <p>The repercussions of Israeli action across the border would be significant, Katz said.</p> <p>\"The end of the peace treaty, demonstrations throughout Egypt, our ambassador being kicked out of Cairo? Israel's ability to respond is very limited.\"</p> <p>After Israeli forces shot dead five Egyptian security personnel on Egyptian soil after last August's cross-border attack, anti-Israel sentiment rose markedly and the Israeli embassy in Cairo came under violent attack.</p> <p>But some are urging a robust response. According to Alex Fishman, the defence analyst for Israel's biggest-selling newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth, the time for direct action is drawing closer.</p> <p>\"The political leadership in Israel&#xa0;\u2026 is being respectful of Egyptian honour, afraid to sneeze next to them or demand, heaven forbid, that they do anything,\" he wrote. \"There will be no choice: Israel is approaching the point at which it will have to deal with Sinai on its own, with everything this entails, including how it will affect the relationship with Egypt. Otherwise there will be a bloodbath here in a style we have not seen before.\"</p>",

Hence the outrage in Turkey over this photograph, released by the White House last week, which shows Obama in the Oval Office, talking to Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, while fiddling a souvenir bat signed by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Aaron\">Hank Aaron</a>.</p> <p>\"The photo reveals from whom our prime minister receives orders to rule the country,\" said one Turkish opposition politician, Metin Lufti Baydar, cannily spotting a PR opportunity, though <a href=\"http://english.ruvr.ru/2012_08_06/Obama-and-his-baseball-bat-speak-softly-and-carry-a-big-stick/\">my favourite take on the matter</a> comes from a columnist for Russia's government-sponsored world service media:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Had he been dressed in a tracksuit and tennis shoes, perhaps we could have been convinced of Obama's sporting virtues and love of sports, yet the photograph shows Obama in his official uniform, complete with jacket and tie, as he very demonstrably holds a baseball bat with a white-knuckle grip \u2026 the White House knows exactly what it is doing.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>This seems, shall we say, relatively unlikely, not least because deliberately sparking a row with Turkey right now would be crazy, given its centrality to addressing the situation in Syria. (The White House was <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/picture-obama-holding-baseball-bat-angers-turkish-political-circles-article-1.1129098\">troubled enough to issue a statement denying any such inference</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/turkeys-leader-dismisses-opposition-criticism-of-obama-holding-baseball-bat-during-phone-call/2012/08/05/0b35d72a-df23-11e1-8d48-2b1243f34c85_story.html\">Erdogan has now added his voice</a>, calling Obama \"a friend who never falls short of respect or politeness\".)</p> <p>Perhaps there's also an issue of cross-cultural symbolism here. In America, a baseball bat can connote violence, but primarily, it connotes a beloved national pastime in which sportsmen and spectators gather in stadiums across the country to eat snacks.

  "<p>A gunman who killed six people at a Sikh place of worship in Wisconsin has been identified as a 40-year-old former soldier with alleged links to racist groups.</p> <p>The white, heavy-set shooter \u2013 who some witnesses suggested carried tattoos marking the 9/11 terrorist attacks \u2013 was named as Wade Michael Page, an former serviceman once stationed at Fort Bragg in North Carolina. Officials have yet to confirm the killer's identity.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Southern Poverty Law Center \u2013 an organisation that monitors the activity of extremist groups \u2013 c<a href=\"http://www.splcenter.org/\">laimed on its website</a> that the shooter was a \"frustrated neo-Nazi who had been the leader of a racist white-power band\".</p> <p>Forensic experts spent Monday searching the gunman's home in Cudahy, just a few miles from Oak Creek, where the Sikh gurdwara is located.</p> <p>Oak Creek police chief John Edwards has already confirmed that the suspect had a military background. It is thought Page was dismissed from the US army in 1998 for \"patterns of misconduct\", including being drunk on duty.</p> <p>Edwards told CNN that the gunman \"lived in a community neighbouring ours\", and said authorities were \"doing a 24-hour back-check, just to get any idea what he was up to, what he was doing\".</p> <p>\"Right now there is no indication that there were any red flags,\" he said.</p> <p>Sunday's attack is being investigated as an act of \"domestic terrorism\", police have said.</p> <p>The suspect began shooting shortly before 10.30am local time as dozens gathered at the gurdwara. After killing people inside the building, the gunman fought with officers outside, critically injuring one. A second officer was able to \"put down\" the suspect, police said. The killer was pronounced dead at the scene.</p> <p>The wounded officer, named on Monday as lieutenant Brian Murphy, 51, a 21-year veteran of the force, was taken to hospital for surgery. He was in a critical condition on Monday.</p> <p>Emergency response teams found the bodies of four victims inside the gurdwara. Three more bodies lay outside the building, including that of the suspect. Three others \u2013 including the policeman \u2013 were injured and taken to a nearby hospital. All were said to be in a \"critical condition\".</p> <p>At a press conference on Sunday, Oak Creek police chief John Edwards said the \"heroic actions\" of the two officers \"stopped this from being worse than it could have been\".</p> <p>Authorities said the gunman had used a 9mm semi-automatic pistol. The weapon, recovered at the scene, is thought to have been obtained legally, but police are still trying to track its origin.</p> <p>Among those shot in the attack were prominent members of the local Sikh community. Jatin Der Mangat, 38, of Racine, said his uncle Satwant Singh Kaleka was one of those wounded, but he didn't know how serious his injuries were.</p> <p>\"It was like the heart just sat down,\" he said. \"This shouldn't happen anywhere.\"</p> <p>Sukhwindar Nagr, also of Racine, said he called his brother-in-law's phone. A granthi at the temple answered and told him that his brother-in-law had been shot, along with three granthi.</p> <p>It is thought that around 50 people were in the gurdwara at the time of the attack.</p> <p>The identification of the gunman has increased concerns that the attacker had a racist motive. The SPLC reported that Page was a known member of the white power music scene, and some witnesses said the suspect had a tattoo marking September 11. Some Sikhs had been targeted after 9/11, apparently mistaken for Muslims by people carrying out revenge attacks.</p> <p>Authorities confirmed the dead suspect had tattoos, but said they were not sure exactly what they illustrated.</p> <p>Police said it was too early to suggest a motive. But some Sikh members of the community told media that they feared that it was a hate crime. Others, however, have cautioned against jumping to conclusions.</p> <p>Sapreet Kaur, executive director of the Sikh Coalition, the largest Sikh American civil rights organisation in the US, said: \"There have been multiple hate crime shootings within the Sikh community in recent years and the natural impulse of our community is to unfortunately assume the same in this case.\"</p> <p>\"Let's let law enforcement investigate the case and as new facts emerge the dialogue can change.\"</p> <p>One woman, aged 41, and five men, including an 84-year-old, were killed in the attack, authorities said during a press conference on Monday.</p> <p>Police chief Edwards commended lieutenant Brian Murphy on his heroism as it emerged that he urged colleague to help others despite being seriously injured himself. Murphy was ambushed by the shooter as he went to tend to a wounded person. He was then shot eight or nine times at close range.</p> <p>But after the gunman was taken down buy a colleague, Murphy waved them away as they attempted to help him.</p> <p>\"He [Murphy] had been shot nine times, including very seriously in the neck area, and he waved them off and told them to go into the the temple to assist those in there,\" Edwards said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, some details about Wade were released by authorities.</p> <p>They confirmed his identity, and said: \"We can say he was in the military between 1992 and 1998, and had a general discharge and he was ineligible for re-enlistment.\"</p> <p>The FBI said that links to white supremacist groups were being looked into, but added that Wade had not been the subject of an investigation. But they were looking at references to him in other files, and he did have a police record, it emerged.</p> <p>The shooting came just 16 days after 12 people were killed and nearly 60 injured in a mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, during a midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises.</p> <p>Wisconsin, like Colorado, has some of the most permissive gun laws in the country. Last year it passed a law allowing citizens to carry a concealed weapon.</p> <p>The second mass shooting in two weeks will likely intensify pressure on US lawmakers to address the issue gun controls. President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney have been largely silent on guns.</p> <p>However, in a statement delivered after Sunday's shooting, Obama said he was \"deeply saddened\" by the incident.</p> <p>Words of condolences also came from leaders overseas, with Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh, a Sikh, expressing his shock and sadness.</p> <p>Singh said: \"That this senseless act of violence should be targeted at a place of religious worship is particularly painful.\"</p>",
