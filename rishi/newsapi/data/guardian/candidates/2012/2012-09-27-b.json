  "<p>With the Obama-Romney presidential contest gaining momentum, many will be asking: where, oh where, is the classic political satire that can tackle the troubled zeitgeist? Could this movie starring Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis be the one? Erm \u2026 not exactly, no. It's a broad comedy, with some outrageous gross-out laughs, directed by Jay Roach and co-written by Shawn Harwell, who contributed to TV's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2010/nov/02/david-gordon-green-eastbound-and-down\" title=\"\">Eastbound and Down</a>. The film doesn't aspire to anything particularly sharp and sophisticated, and even diehard Ferrell fans might feel he isn't exactly giving us the shock of the new. But it's entertaining. Ferrell plays the appalling Congressman Cam Brady campaigning for re-election. He's a loathsome married womaniser whose polling numbers go into freefall when a&#xa0;drunk-dialled wrong number accidentally places his lascivious phone message on the answering machine of a fiercely Christian family. His opponents smell blood and put up a nerdy wholesome guy against him, local tourism chief Marty Huggins (Galifianakis), and the campaign turns nasty after the two candidates' nakedly hostile \"Civility Brunch\". If you're solemnly looking for contemporary political observation, this isn't the film for you. But laughs come rolling off the production line a-plenty.</p>",
  "<p>Quick: name the most memorable moment from the three presidential debates between Barack Obama and John McCain?</p> <p>Nothing coming to mind? (And no, Sarah Palin saying \"you betcha\" in the vice-presidential debate doesn't count.)</p> <p>How about the 2004 debates between John Kerry and George W Bush? Well, there was that line about a \"global test\" and then that great internet rumor that Bush had <a href=\"http://www.visualfuturist.com/bushiswired/\">a radio receiver on his back</a>. But anything else ring a bell?</p> <p>This isn't just a memory test for Guardian readers \u2013 it's a perhaps less-than-subtle reminder that even though presidential debates are often viewed as the most important part of a campaign (aside from the national conventions), they actually affect the final election results a lot less than you might think. If Mitt Romney is hoping that the debates turn the tide in what is an ever-widening polling gap between him and Barack Obama, he might want to think again.</p> <p>The idea of debates being a less consequential campaign event will likely seem counter-intuitive to many. For weeks, these TV setpieces have been hyped as the signal events of the fall campaign. And doesn't history provide many lessons of game-changing debate moments?</p> <p>Was it not Richard Nixon's five o'clock shadow that doomed him against the much smoother John F Kennedy <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QazmVHAO0os&amp;feature=player_embedded\">in 1960</a>? Or what about Ronald Reagan's famous quip in 1984, when asked if he was too old to be president:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's (Walter Mondale) youth and inexperience.\"</p> </blockquote>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fJhCjMfRndk?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"276\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fJhCjMfRndk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Or what about Michael Dukakis's robotic response to a query about whether he would still oppose the death penalty for a rapist-killer if his wife, Kitty, had been the victim?</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aUXz4wFDAo0?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"276\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aUXz4wFDAo0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>These are just the sort of game-changing moments that allow the Romney campaign a flicker of hope.</p> <p>But not so fast. While political pundits love to impart great meaning and importance to these events, political scientists aren't so convinced. As John Sides, a political scientist at George Washington University, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/septemberoctober_2012/ten_miles_square/do_presidential_debates_really039413.php?page=1\">wrote recently</a> in Washington Monthly:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Scholars who have looked most carefully at the data have found that, when it comes to shifting enough votes to decide the outcome of the election, presidential debates have rarely, if ever, mattered \u2026 in the average election year, you can accurately predict where the race will stand after the debates by knowing the state of the race before the debates.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Debate gaffes, like your garden-variety campaign gaffes, rarely, if ever, move public opinion polls or affect the final outcome of elections. Even if Dukakis had given a more emotional response to the death penalty question, or if George Bush hadn't been caught <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2008/01/17/a-damaging-impatience\">checking his watch</a> during the 1992 debate, both candidates were still likely to lose.</p> <p>Reagan's zinger against Mondale was highly effective, but incumbents who win 49 states don't need a great debate line to ride to victory.</p> <p>The first of two possible exceptions to the general rule of debate irrelevance is the <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/debates/history/1980/index.shtml\">1980 debate between Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter</a>, which came only days before the election. While Reagan held a small lead going into the debate, by the weekend before election day, polls showed him approaching a landslide-like advantage. The debate, rather than \"changing the game\", simply confirmed the direction the polls were already headed \u2013 albeit in a decisive manner.</p> <p>Reagan, who was regularly portrayed by Carter in the most negative terms imaginable and, in particular, as a war-monger, came across as cool, calm and collected \u2013 anything but a loose cannon. If Americans needed reassurance that they could trust Reagan in the White House, the debate clinched it.</p> <p>In 2000, Al Gore's <a href=\"http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/wed-october-4-2000/indecision-2000---sigh-language\">constant sighing</a> during his first presidential debate with George W Bush turned him into an object of ridicule (even Saturday Night Live poked fun at Gore's tic). According to Sides, Gore's unfortunate show of contemptuous impatience may have shifted the polls by two to three points in sympathy with his opponent, Bush. Considering the narrowness of Gore's eventual \"defeat\", the debate could be considered one of several decisive factors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.nbc.com/assets/video/widget/widget.html?vid=1356981\"> <iframe id=\"nbc-video-widget\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" src=\"https://www.nbc.com/assets/video/widget/widget.html?vid=1356981\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But for those two examples, there is always the experience of John Kerry, who, in 2004, won not one, not two, but all three presidential debates against George W Bush, according to post debate polling \u2013 and still lost the election. Quite simply, Kerry's strong performance couldn't cancel out the advantages of his opponent. Or, still more importantly, while the debates gave him a boost in the polls, they didn't have the effect of fundamentally reversing the trajectory of the race. This is perhaps the most important factor: debates might affect the polls around the margins, but they have never had a seismic impact on a presidential campaign.</p> <p>And this brings us back to Mitt Romney. If the latest public opinion polls are to be believed, the Romney campaign is in serious and deepening trouble. Not only is he <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/27/politics/campaign-wrap/index.html\">trailing in the national polls</a>, but he is also losing badly in <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/09/20/1134217/-New-Swing-State-Polls-Show-Romney-Falling-With-More-Trouble-Possibly-Looming\">swing state polls</a> from Ohio, Virginia and Florida, each of which suggests that Obama is opening up sizable, even insurmountable, leads.</p> <p>No matter how well Romney does in his debates with Obama, what reason is there to believe that he can do well enough to reverse this increasingly dire trend? Have any actions to date by the gaffe-tastic Romney given credence to the notion that he has the political chops to change the direction of the race in these debates? If anything, because of his now almost daily faux pas, even the smallest slip-up has the potential to dominate post debate coverage. The guy is practically going to have to bat 1,000, just to eke out a win.</p> <p>Moreover, it's not all about Romney. There is even less reason to believe that Barack Obama will make a mistake so grievous and costly that he will open the door to a Romney comeback. There's a reason, after all, people call him \"no-drama Obama\".</p> <p>Unless the president uses the debate to unleash a profanity-laced diatribe against the people of Ohio and Florida, it's very hard to imagine anything he could do or say that would badly hurt him. To be honest, even if he were, inexplicably, to do such a thing, I'm not convinced it would cost him the election. Considering the current polarization of the electorate and the dearth of undecided voters \u2013 short of Obama's breaking out the legendary \"whitey\" tape, or admitting that, yes, he was born in Kenya \u2013 he's likely safe.</p> <p>None of this is to suggest that voters shouldn't tune in to the debates. They are an excellent opportunity to more fully appreciate the positions of the two candidates and understand the rather profound differences between the two parties. Just don't expect it to make much of a difference in a race where the outlines of the final results are becoming increasingly clear.</p>",
  "<p>Fear that Barack Obama is going to win another four years is beginning to seep into the ranks of Mitt Romney supporters. </p> <p>About 200 people turned out to see Romney on a campaign stop in Virginia Thursday. It was not a big crowd but it was a loyal one, expressing hope against hope that the Republican candidate might yet turn in a dazzling performance in the first of the presidential debates next week. </p> <p>And yet, in the wake of polls on Wednesday showing Obama ahead by 10% in Ohio and 9% in Florida, there is a grim, growing recognition that hopes of the White House might be starting to slip. </p> <p>\"At this point, I have my fears that Obama will be back and we will see four years more of no growth,\" said Patrick Gallagher, 59, a former army engineer. </p> <p>Having said that, he expressed a distrust of polls, based on his experience of previous elections and hoped the three debates coming up might swing independents. \"The election in this state and nationwide will hinge on what happens in these debates,\" Gallagher said. \"It is a chance to see them go head to head.\"</p> <p>Romney's speech, at an American Legion hall in Springfield full mainly of vets, was targetted at voters either in the military or ex-military, warning that proposed Pentagon tax cuts will cost jobs and put America's security at risk.</p> <p>As a piece of micro-targeting, it is clever. Republicans are strongest in the south, but to win Virginia Romney needs also to take votes in the north, and people with military links are a good bet.</p> <p>But he showed little enthusiasm or passion, looking like someone weighed down by the polls and wondering how he could go on delivering speeches like this week after week all the way to November 6.</p> <p>He said it was unthinkable that the government would cut military spending when the world remains \"troubled and dangerous\". The problem for Romney with this as an attack line is that the Republicans, including running mate Paul Ryan, voted for those very cuts.</p> <p>He demonstrated yet again he is not an inspirational speaker. Even when he won an ovation when he said \"when I become president\", it was not long-lasting, with people just popping out of their seats and quickly sitting down again. </p> <p>Mackie Christenson, 65, from Leesburg, Virgina, said she believes Romney can still win in spite of the polls. \"Reagan was down 9% at this point against Carter,\" she said.</p> <p>She is not upset that Romney has changed tack over the last few days, more positive about Obama, acknowledging he cares about America. Romney is \"basically a nice person. Politics is a blood sport, and he is swimming with sharks.\".</p> <p>She predicted Romney will win the debate next week because he will have a chance to call out Obama on what she said were repeated lies about contraception \u2013 Republicans are not opposed to contraception, she said \u2013 the killing of ambassador Chris Stevens and other issues.</p> <p>She is especially annoyed that so many women are backing Obama. \"Women make up 75% of the unemployed. They are having to cope with high food prices. And yet they are for Obama because they think he is cute.\"</p> <p>Gallagher said that Obama's poll leads might even backfire. \"I think the poll leads could hurt Obama. If Obama supporters think he is going to win, they might stay at home,\" Gallagher said.</p> <p>That is far from being a vote of confidence in Romney's chances.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama called for a new era of \"economic patriotism\" as he launched a fresh series of attacks on Mitt Romney for his comments disparaging 47% of Americans as freeloaders.</p> <p>As the first votes were cast in the White House election, Obama placed the 47% remarks at the heart of his campaign, telling supporters in Virginia that change in cannot be achieved in one term and \"it can't happen if you write off half the nation before you take office\". </p> <p>Romney's comments were caught on a secretly recorded video when the Republican presidential candidate addressed a small group of wealthy donors in May.</p> <p>The attack was reinforced in new ads released Thursday. In one, Romney's voice is heard dismissing the 47% of the population who he said are dependent on the government and take no responsibility for their own lives. On screen, as Romney speaks, are pictures of the groups the Democrats suggest he was referring to: the elderly, veterans, Latinos, children and working-class women.</p> <p>It is a potent election message, and Romney's remarks are proving to be one of the most destructive moments of the whole White House campaign.</p> <p>Another Obama ad deals with \"economic patriotism\", a new label for the president's economic promises, which include creating 1m manufacturing jobs and hiring thousands of new teachers.</p> <p>They are to be broadcast in seven swing states: Virginia, Florida, Ohio, New Hampshire, Iowa, Colorado and Nevada. But they are not being shown in North Carolina, a sign that the Obama campaign may have written the state off as a gain for Romney. </p> <p>The \"economic patriotism\" promotes economic growth from the bottom up and contrasts this with Romney's trickle-down approach.</p> <p>\"This country doesn't succeed when only the rich get richer,\" Obama said in his speech. \"We succeed when the middle class gets bigger, when there are ladders of opportunity for all who strive to get into the middle class, when everybody who's willing to work hard has a chance to get ahead and live up to their God-given potential.\"</p> <p>Then, turning directly to the secret video, Obama added: \"I don't think we can get very far with leaders who write off half the nation as a bunch of victims who never take responsibility for their own lives.\"</p> <p>Both Obama and Romney were campaigning in Virginia on Thursday in areas with a strong military presence. The president was in Virginia Beach while Romney was in Springfield.</p> <p>Obama opted for a broad appeal to voters while Romney flailed about in the wake of disastrous poll figures showing him badly trailing the president in swing states. Obama is ahead in Virginia in spite of predictions he would not be able to hold it after his 2008 win.</p> <p>Early voting began in Iowa on Thursday and starts in Ohio next week and elsewhere round the country. An estimated 30%-40% of those voting will have cast their ballots before election day November 6.</p> <p>In his speech, Obama, echoing Romney's secret video, said that wherever he visited in America, including Virginia, he did not find victims as Romney contended but hardworking Americans.</p> <p>\"I see students trying to work their way through college. I see single moms, like my mom, putting in overtime to raise their kids right. I see senior citizens who have been saving for retirement your entire lives,\" Obama said. \"I see a whole bunch of veterans who served this country with bravery and distinction.\"</p> <p>In what could be a rehearsal for the first presidential debate in Denver on Wednesday, he noted that Romney had picked up on a comment he had made that change in Washington does not come from the inside and that change in Washington had to come the outside.</p> <p>\"And for some reason, this got governor Romney really excited. And he rewrote his speech, and he stood up at a rally and he proudly declared: 'I'll get the job done from the inside' \u2013 which got me thinking, what kind of inside job are you talking about?,\" Obama said, proving that not only does he have better delivery than Romney, he has better speech-writers.</p> <p>As the laughter subsided, Obama continued: \"Because if it's the inside job of rubber-stamping the top-down, lobbyist-driven agenda of this Republican Congress, we don't want that. If it's the inside job of letting oil companies write energy policy, insurance companies writing health care policy, outsourcers writing our tax code, we don't need that. If it's the inside job of trying to control the health care choices that women are perfectly capable of making themselves, we'll take a pass on that. We don't need an inside job.\"</p> <p>He added, ramming home his point about Romney's speech: \"In 2008, 47% of this country did not vote for me. But the night of the election, I said to all those Americans, I said, I may not have won your vote, but I hear your voice. I need your help. I will be your president, too.\"</p>",
  "<p>With Harvard Law Professor Elizabeth Warren gaining ground in the Massachusetts Senate race, US Senator Scott Brown's campaign decided there was nowhere to go but negative. Brown <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Elections/Senate/2012/0926/Elizabeth-Warren-and-Cherokee-heritage-what-is-known-about-allegations\">has blasted Warren</a> for months, charging that she claimed Native American heritage to take advantage of university affirmative action employment policies. In the first debate between the two, Brown went so far as to say that Warren did not look Indian.</p> <p>But his campaign finally overreached. At a recent Boston campaign event, a group of Brown supporters, including some members of his Senate staff, <a href=\"http://bluemassgroup.com/2012/09/scott-brown-staffers-do-indian-war-whoop-tomahawk-chop-youtube/\">taunted Warren's backers</a> with tomahawk chops and pseudo war chants. Suffice to say that such displays don't go <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2012/09/origins_of_the_tomahawk_chop_scott_brown_s_staffers_mocking_elizabeth_warren_are_continuing_a_long_tradition_.html\">down well with Native Americans</a>.</p> <p>Brown's first apology wasn't enough for the Cherokee Nation. \"A campaign that would allow and condone such offensive and racist behavior must be called to task for their actions,\" Principal Chief Bill John Baker <a href=\"http://bluemassgroup.com/2012/09/chief-of-cherokee-nation-calls-on-scott-brown-to-apologize-for-his-staff/\">said in a statement</a>. Brown was finally forced to come up with a <a href=\"http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2012/09/26/Scott-Brown-warns-staff-over-war-whoops/UPI-57811348683620/\">stronger mea culpa and a zero tolerance policy</a> on any future stunts.</p> <p>The no-more-Mr-Nice-Guy strategy is fraught with perils for Brown. He won his Senate seat, in part, thanks to his carefully crafted persona as a genial, regular Joe in an old barn coat who cruises around the state in a pickup truck. Even long-time Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, a Democratic warhorse if there ever was one, counts Brown as a friend and <a href=\"http://bostonglobe.com/metro/2012/09/21/brown-warren-push-for-votes-day-after-debate/RtEQIpZLLr2jZyM2A6e2rI/story.html\">waited as long as politically possible before endorsing Warren</a>. </p> <p>The feisty Warren is easygoing and personable on the campaign trail. But she's opted against being either warm and fuzzy or too <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/03/fight-for-the-cfpa-is-a-d_n_483707.html\">in-your-face</a> where it counts for most voters: on television. Her response to the heritage controversy has been muddled and only recently has she come out with a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oIVinDXzOw\">more robust response</a>.</p> <p>Dial up the wayback machine and the personable Brown might well have been making short work of Warren, as he did with state <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/01/21/coakley_aides_paint_portrait_of_missteps_on_campaign_trail/\">Attorney General Martha Coakley in the 2010 special election</a> to fill the late Senator Ted Kennedy's seat. But in this Senate race, personal appeal is bumping up hard against the realities of party politics in a presidential election year. According to Alan Wolfe, a Boston College political science professor:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"If we lived in a world in which we vote for the candidate [as an individual], you couldn't lose as a middle class person by voting for either, but we don't live in that world. Party \u2026 matters right now more than the person, and the parties right now have very different approaches to the middle class.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The two candidates break even on the crucial issue of middle class \"cred\". Warren often describes herself as growing up on the \"ragged edge of the middle class\". She worked as a waitress as a young teenager, after her father had had a heart attack. Her self-description could just as easily also apply to Brown, whose working mother briefly relied on welfare.</p> <p>So, Brown's strategy is to keep Warren off her game, which runs on <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-15/obama-eliminates-warren-as-consumer-head.html\">her deep knowledge</a> of the economy, consumer affairs, and Wall Street, lest she get more traction in turning the race into a referendum on the national Republican party and Brown's <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/scott_p_brown/index.html\">Senate record</a>.</p> <p>Four of five <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2012-massachusetts-senate-brown-vs-warren\">recent state-wide polls showed</a> Warren edging out in front of Brown in what remains a very close race. Warren picked up <a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/DNC/Events/Elizabeth-Warren-at-the-2012-Democratic-National-Convention/C3779973/\">her Democratic national convention bounce</a> and ran with it. She hits all the right notes for her Democratic base on Massachusetts middle-class worries like unaffordable mortgages, student loan and credit card debt and bad guys like \"Big Oil\" and \"millionaires and billionaires\". For his part, <a href=\"http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2012/08/scott_brown_says_hes_not_tryin.html\">Brown passed up a Republican national convention speaking slot</a> \u2013 a move that deliberately distanced him from Mitt Romney, the state's former governor and his political mentor. </p> <p>In the Senate, Brown has little room to maneuver on controversial issues like tax policy that are central to Republican orthodoxy. <a href=\"http://www.unh.edu/survey-center/news/pdf/bg_2012-bg32.pdf\">Few Massachusetts likely voters believe</a> that he would raise tax rates on the wealthy Americans. Indeed, he's opposed <a href=\"http://www.investinganswers.com/financial-dictionary/tax-center/buffett-rule-3653\">the \"Buffett rule</a>\" and <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/politicalintelligence/2012/07/25/senator-scott-brown-votes-against-extending-tax-cuts-under-gop-democrat-plans/WsuIo08WEpvOo67TYcwizH/story.html\">lifting Bush era tax cuts</a> on higher-income earners while preserving them for workers making less than $250,000.</p> <p>Bay State voters are cool toward their former governor \u2013 President Obama is expected to trounce Romney easily here \u2013 and cooler still toward the conservative Republicans who dominate the national party. Yet, a strong Democratic turnout doesn't guarantee victory for Warren in a state where independents <a href=\"http://www.sec.state.ma.us/ele/elepdf/2012_Party_Enrollment_Stats.pdf\">comprise more than 50%</a> of the electorate and historically have few qualms about voting for moderate Republicans like Brown.</p> <p>Which is why the tomahawk/chant episode could be a pivotal moment. It recalls a ghost of campaigns past: the 2006 Massachusetts gubernatorial race. Kerry Healey, the Republican candidate and Romney's lieutenant governor, deployed an ad <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/1031/p10s01-uspo.html\">loaded with powerful racial overtones</a> against the Deval Patrick, the African-American political newcomer. The tactic backfired badly: Healey never recovered and lost to Patrick in a rout. He is now in his midway through his second term; she advises the Romney campaign.</p> <p>Much is riding on the mood of the Massachusetts electorate. Do voters believe that Brown is still an affable guy who understands their issues better and can make himself heard in a politically polarized capital? Or is the Harvard law school maverick and consumer protection champion the best person to send to Washington?</p> <p>Clearly, Brown <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/politicalintelligence/2012/09/24/elizabeth-warren-defends-work-asbestos-lawsuit/LXxLBL9BBBHIXEDzQoFBLO/story.html\">has opted to keep voters focused</a> on his view of Warren's personal shortcomings. That could be a costly gamble for a nice guy.</p>",
  "<p></p> <h2><a name=\"economy\">Economy</a></h2> <p><strong>It's the economy, stupid \u2013 or is it? You have to go back more than 70 years to find a president who retained his job when so many of his compatriots lost theirs. Economic gloom made short work of Jimmy Carter and George Bush Sr. But Barack Obama's record is not all bad \u2013 and that might be good enough to save him, says Larry Elliott</strong></p> <p>Barack Obama should be toast. Under his stewardship, the US economy has suffered its feeblest economic recovery since the second world war. Living standards for the average American have fallen since he arrived at the White House almost four years ago.</p> <p>Despite his rallying call to the struggling and the dispossessed in 2008, poverty is rising and the gap between rich and poor has grown. History shows that the last incumbent president to win an election with the unemployment rate above 8% was Franklin D Roosevelt.</p> <p>If the race for White House is about the economy \u2013 and American voters routinely say it is \u2013 Mitt Romney would be winning the election by a country mile and Obama contemplating joining George Bush Sr and Jimmy Carter as one-term presidents of the modern era.</p> <p>Polling by the Pew Research Centre shows that only 41% of Americans say their own personal financial situation is excellent or good, while consumer confidence is lower than it was when Gerald Ford lost to Carter in 1976 and when Carter was turfed out by Ronald Reagan four years later. The last time Americans felt this gloomy was in 1992, and Bill Clinton won.</p> <p>The fact that real median incomes, a benchmark of how well the middle classes are doing, have dropped by 4.7% since Obama became president has allowed Romney to ask the question so tellingly posed by Reagan against Carter: \"Are you better off than you were four years ago?\"</p> <p>If the well-off in the US were asked that question, the answer would be yes. The top 5% of earners, those making $186,000 (\u00a3115,000) or more, took 22.3% of national income in 2011, up from 21.3% in 2010.</p> <p>Income inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, is greater than it has been since records began in 1975, making the US the fourth most unequal country in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development after Chile, Mexico and Turkey. All this has got the pollsters scratching their heads.</p> <p>Bruce Stokes, fellow of the Pew Institute, said: \"Back in the spring, my assumption was that if unemployment remained above 8%, the president was going to lose. It has remained above 8% but despite that the president retains a great deal of public support, and that has grown in the last month.\"</p> <p>Obama has been helped in recent weeks by some tentative signs that the economy is on the mend. The recession in the real estate market \u2013 the worst the US has ever endured \u2013 appears to be at an end, with housing starts, home sales and property prices all on the rise.</p> <p>Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, has lifted share prices on Wall Street by announcing that the US central bank will continue to use monetary stimulus until there is clear evidence of sustained growth. An easing of the eurozone crisis has calmed fears that the economy might plunge off a cliff in the runup to election day.</p> <p>There is, though, perhaps more to it than that. Analysts at Capital Economics say that the darkest days for the US economy were in the months between Obama's election victory in November 2008 and his inauguration in early 2009 and that the economy is in much better shape now than it was then.</p> <p>\"At the end of 2008, GDP was falling at an annualised rate of 9%, over 700,000 jobs were being lost every month and the banking system was in meltdown,\" Capital Economics said.</p> <p>Polls show that many voters still blame Bush and the Republicans for the current weakness in the economy, while at the same time giving Obama credit for rescuing the US car industry when it was faced with bankruptcy.</p> <p>Even this, however, does not appear to be the whole story, as voters in the swing states appear to be planning to vote for Obama while at the same time believing that Romney would be just as good, if not better, at handling the economy.</p> <p>According to Stokes, the explanation may be that Obama is well ahead when it comes to other issues, such as healthcare and national security, and is also seen as a more likable candidate.</p> <p>Romney's only hope in the remaining weeks of the campaign is to make Obama's handling of the economy the key election issue. If he fails to do so, Obama looks likely to be re-elected.</p> <p></p> <h2><a name=\"Health\">Health</a></h2> <p><strong>Obama's healthcare reform was arguably the biggest domestic achievement of his presidency, requiring Americans to buy health insurance and making sure people with pre-existing conditions got insurance. Republicans denounced the act as unaffordable, a violation of individual freedom. Romney pledged to repeal the care act in its entirety but now says there are a things he would keep \u2013 including allowing young adults to stay on parental policies until they are 25. In a trip to the US, the Guardian's health editor, Sarah Boseley, found plenty of beneficiaries of the Obama reforms</strong></p> <p>Dawn Josephson, who lives in Jacksonville, Florida, fell foul of an insurance trap. In 2008 her son, Wesley, then two, woke up one morning with just the white of one eye showing and the iris of the other hardly visible. It was sudden-onset strabismus, caused by lack of co-ordination between eye muscles and the brain. His eyes were no longer focusing on the same point.</p> <p>They were paying $800 (\u00a3495) a month for health insurance for their family of four, with an excess of $1,500, and they were liable for 20% of their costs after that.</p> <p>Wesley had a surgical procedure costing about $8,000, although there was no overnight stay. With lab tests, the bills probably came to $12,000.</p> <p>\"About two months later, we got a nice little note from our insurance company saying, 'we are now terminating this policy and we have nothing else to offer you',\" she said. \"My husband and I are self-employed, so we have to get our own policy. We found another for about the same rate, but because Wesley had this pre-existing condition, anything relating to the eye was not covered. We were still going to the doctor every two months, paying anything from $600 to $1,000 for doctors' bills.\"</p> <p>The local Nemours children's hospital offered a payment scheme, so they ran up bills and paid a small monthly amount towards them.</p> <p>\"Around April 2010, we said, 'we can't do this any more, there has got to be an alternative',\" she said.</p> <p>An insurance agent found the family a cheaper policy, which at least saved them money for Wesley's bills.</p> <p>When Josephson called the insurance company to check on the policy, she was told everyone was covered, including Wesley. Josephson could not believe what she was hearing.</p> <p>\"For a split second I thought they made a mistake \u2013 just shut up and take the policy,\" she said. \"Then she said to me, 'we are no longer excluding pre-existing conditions for children'.\"</p> <p>On 23 March, Obama had signed the affordable care act into law. Wesley Josephson had just become one of the first beneficiaries.</p> <p></p> <h2><a name=\"foreign\">Foreign policy</a></h2> <p><strong>Foreign policy did not figure much in the campaign, until the killing of the US ambassador to Libya this month. Since then the gloves have come off, writes Julian Borger, the Guardian's diplomatic editor</strong></p> <p>Mitt Romney said very little about foreign affairs on the stump but he seized on the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi as an emblem of America's place in the world under Obama. He claimed that the US response to the wave of attacks on American diplomatic mission had been to apologise for the amateur video that had triggered them.</p> <p>It turned out he has his timings wrong and that a statement by the US embassy in Cairo condemning the video for its cynical portrayal of the prophet Muhammad had preceded the attacks.</p> <p>But the Romney campaign pressed on with the theme, seeking to cast the administration as apologising for American values abroad.</p> <p>The president appeared to slip in a television interview aired in which he described the riots as \"bumps in the road\" on the way to a functioning democracy.</p> <p>Romney responded quickly saying: \"These are not bumps in the road, these are human lives.\"</p> <p>The theme resonated because of popular perceptions of what was widely seen as ingratitude among the new north African democracies for American support for the Arab spring.</p> <p>The Republican vice-presidential nominee, Paul Ryan, claimed this week that the riots over the anti-Muslim video were a demonstration of how the Obama foreign policy was \"blowing up in our faces\".</p> <p>Ryan compared the scenes from north Africa to the 1979 Iranian revolution, implying a comparison between Obama and the Democratic president at the time, Jimmy Carter, the personification among American conservatives of weak, unpatriotic, leadership.</p> <p>Obama has sought to counter that narrative with his emphatic celebration of those values in this week's speech to the UN general assembly.</p> <p>On the bigger picture, that is some polling evidence that Obama has the edge.</p> <p>A new YouGov poll, seen by the Guardian, shows that, while a large majority of Republicans see their country locked in a zero-sum struggle with Islam, Americans as a whole rejects that view by 47% to 39%. Almost half those polled believe \"it is possible for the west and Muslims to coexist in peace\".</p> <p>Obama's UN speech mentioned in passing what the White House believes are its principal achievements abroad \u2013 the killing of Osama bin Laden, the withdrawal from Iraq, and the planned pullout from Afghanistan.</p> <p>The first aspect inoculates Obama from Republican attacks for lack of resolve over the other two. The slayer of America's enemy number one cannot easily be accused of being weak on security. Moreover, there is no political advantage to be gained in a war-weary America by arguing that the White House is cutting and running from foreign conflicts.</p> <p></p> <h2><a name=\"immigration\">Immigration</a></h2> <p><strong>Immigration reform is one of the top issues for Latino voters. Most of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the US are Latino. Obama won their overwhelming support in 2008, and polls show he should repeat this in November. Although he failed to deliver on his promise to introduce immigration reform, he has taken action, bypassing Congress, to give the children of some illegal immigrants relief from the threat of arrest. He has also promised reform in a second term. But as Ewen MacAskill and Ed Pilkington report, there is still a long way to go to prevent immigrants from falling foul of individual states taking matters into their own hands</strong></p> <p>Latinos living without immigration papers in Arizona have begun bombarding helplines and lawyers' offices with requests about how to provide for their children should they be arrested under the controversial new police power that came into effect last week.</p> <p>A phoneline hosted by the Arizona branch of the American Civil Liberties Union received almost 4,000 calls in two days, many from anxious parents who fear their children could be left abandoned should they be picked up under the \"show-me-your-papers\" provision.</p> <p>Hundreds have been asking for help setting up a power of attorney, which gives a relative or friend who has US citizenship the right to care for minors in such an eventuality.</p> <p>\"People are terrified. They fear that they will go to the store to buy groceries and won't get home, and their kids will be left alone at school,\" said Luz Santiago, a pastor in Mesa. She said she had personally handled about 50 requests for power of attorney so far.</p> <p>The \"show-me-your-papers\" clause is the most deeply contested of the provisions of SB 1070, an Arizona law passed in 2010 that has set the benchmark for a wave of hardline immigration laws clamping down on undocumented families in several states.</p> <p>Under its terms, police are required to investigate the immigration status of anyone they come across during their normal work and whom they suspect of being unauthorised.</p> <p>The law was snarled up in legal challenges that went up to the US supreme court. In June, the court struck down several elements of the legislation but allowed the clause to go ahead pending local Arizona court approval.</p> <p>That approval was granted this week and the provision is now in effect.</p> <p>Residents of Phoenix, the capital of Arizona, are braced for the rule change, having witnessed the impact of heavy-handed policing for years under Joe Arpaio, who calls himself \"America's toughest sheriff\".</p> <p>Groups working with undocumented Hispanics are more concerned about other smaller towns, such as Flagstaff and Prescott, which have large Latino populations but no experience of police officers acting as immigration agents.</p> <p>Tucson, Arizona's second-largest city, is calling a forum next Tuesday in which community leaders will meet the police chief, Roberto Villasenor, to discuss the implementation of the clause.</p> <p>Regina Romero, who sits on the city council and convened the meeting, said the clear fear was that police would be drawn into racial profiling. \"We live 45 minutes from the Mexican border, so who else other than Mexicans are you going to be picking up? You are not going to be looking for Canadians in this part of the country,\" she said.</p> <p>Alessandra Soler, head of the ACLU in Arizona, said that there was already evidence that Tucson police were making contact inappropriately with US border patrol officers even for such mundane issues as help with translation.</p> <p>\"It's extremely problematic when you have local police contacting border patrol when there is no good reason.\"</p> <p>The ACLU and other groups have an outstanding civil rights action against SB 1070 still lodged with the state's appeal court. That legal attempt to put a stop to \"show me your papers\" will continue to pass through the courts, and the intention of opponents of the provision is to beef it up with real examples of racial profiling.</p> <p>Lydia Guzman, director of the hotline, said the aim now was to chronicle the impact of the law. \"The supreme court has given us the green light to present to the courts victims of racial profiling, so that's our challenge: show me the victims.\"</p> <p></p> <h2><a name=\"gender\">The gender gap</a></h2> <p><strong>Polls show women could be a crucial issue for the Democrats, with Romney lagging 20 points behind Obama with women voters, writes Karen McVeigh</strong></p> <p>Democrats tend to do better among women voters than Republicans, but even allowing for historical precedent, Romney is performing terribly with a demographic group whose votes can be decisive in swing states.</p> <p>The latest polls suggest that the gender gap this year could hit historic levels, with Romney trailing Obama by some 20 points among women nationally, and even more in some key battlegrounds.</p> <p>There are many policy related reasons behind the antipathy towards the Republicans among female voters. Women are more likely consider healthcare and social issues as important to their voting choice.</p> <p>But Romney has said that if elected he will repeal Obama's Affordable Healthcare Act, and social issues have persistently intruded on his campaign's attempts to focus on the economy.</p> <p>One of the defining Democrat attacks on the Republican candidate and his party has been over its \"war on women\", for policies on equal pay, domestic abuse, abortion and contraception.</p> <p>The drive by Republican lawmakers to cut funding for Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest provider of cancer screening to women with low incomes, has alienated some female voters, as have attempts to restrict access to abortion.</p> <p>Romney has flipped his position on abortion, running as pro-choice in Massachusetts, before changing it to anti-choice when running for presidency in 2008.</p> <p>By picking Paul Ryan, one of the most staunch anti-abortion conservatives as running mate, Romney has alienated moderates. That tension was further exposed in August amid the furore over the \"legitimate rape\" comments of Senate candidate Todd Akin.</p> <p></p> <h2><a name=\"funding\">Campaign finance</a></h2> <p><strong>Court rulings have given corporations and the super-rich a greater role in the elections than ever, writes Ed Pilkington</strong></p> <p>Super Pacs sound like a new child's toy. In fact, these new entities, arising from two court rulings, form the single most important innovation of the 2012 election cycle and are pumping a torrent of private and corporate money into the race.</p> <p>Formed in the wake of two controversial court rulings in 2010, Citizens United v FEC and Speechnow.org v FEC, Super Pacs \u2013 based on the traditional political action committees but able to engage in unlimited political spending outside campaigns \u2013 allow corporations, for the first time in more than 40 years, to use their financial muscle to influence an election.</p> <p>Super Pacs cannot directly fund candidates but they can support them with their own message.</p> <p>Collectively, Super Pacs have already spent $270m this year. The Republicans have the edge on spending, with billionaire donors such as Sheldon Adelson and Bob Perry wading in with tens of millions of dollars. The Republican Super Pac effort is being closely co-ordinated by George Bush's former svengali, Karl Rove.</p> <p>Obama has a Super Pac that supports his candidacy, Priorities USA, but it has raised $43m to the $97m raised by Restore Our Future, the Super Pac which backs Romney.</p>",
  "<p>The Russian aluminium tycoon Oleg Deripaska dramatically settled his long-running feud with the billionaire businessman Michael Cherney on Thursday when Deripaska announced both parties had reached an out of court settlement.</p> <p>In a brief statement aides to Deripaska said: \"Mr Deripaska announces that Mr Cherney's litigation in London against him has been terminated.</p> <p>Neither party will be making any further comment in relation to the litigation or matters raised therein.\"</p> <p>The enigmatic settlement came just days before the Uzbek-born Cherney was due to give video evidence from Israel next Tuesday. The \u00a31bn private litigation case was due to resume in the high court's new Rolls building. It was scheduled to be one of the biggest battles in British legal history, with more than 70 witnesses \u2013 some of whom were to give evidence anonymously for their own protection.</p> <p>Deripaska was scheduled to go into the witness box in November. His fellow oligarch Roman Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea FC, had agreed to give evidence in support of Deripaska, one of Russia's richest men and the owner of Rusal, the world's largest aluminium producer. The case would have shed light on one of the murkiest episodes in Russia's bloody post-Soviet history, when rival groups and organised crime bosses fought for control of the country's lucrative aluminium industry. The so-called \"aluminium wars\" were characterised by a series of gangland-style murders, political skulduggery and extortion claimed at the highest levels.</p> <p>Cherney claimed that during this period under President Boris Yeltsin in the 1990s he was Deripaska's business partner. Cherney alleged that he had a beneficial interest in the Sibal aluminium company, which later merged with Sibneft to form Rusal. Deripaska vehemently denied the claim as part of his legal battle.</p> <p>According to Deripaska, the arrangement between the two men was simply one of \"krysha\" \u2014 the Russian word for \"roof\" \u2014 with Deripaska paying Cherney and his mafia partners huge sums of money in return for physical and political protection. Cherney denied this and said that without his help Deripaska \u2013 now a close ally of Russia's President Vladimir Putin \u2013 would never have become a major player in the industry.</p> <p>Abramovich successfully used a similar krysha defence in his recent high court battle against the long-term Kremlin critic Boris Berezovsky. The case ended in humiliation for Berezovsky, the plaintiff, who announced this week he would not be appealing against a crushing judgement against him by Lady Justice Gloster.</p> <p>Aides to Deripaska suggested that Gloster's ruling \u2013 acknowledging the existence of krysha arrangements \u2013 had clearly strengthened the Rusal owner's case. But they refused to comment on the nature of the settlement or answer whether one party had paid money to the other.</p> <p>Cherney had claimed that in March 2001 he and Deripaska reached an agreement in a London hotel. In it, Cherney said, Deripaska agreed to pay him $250m (\u00a3154m) for his share of Sibal, together with 20% per cent of the shares, to be transferred at a later stage. Cherney complained that he never got the shares.</p> <p>The case began in July. Cherney was unable to travel to London to attend it since authorities in Spain had issued an EU-wide arrest warrant for him. They want to question him in connection with allegations of money-laundering. Cherney left Russia in 1991 and is resident in Israel.</p> <p>Deripaska is known in the UK having been a long-time friend of Peter Mandelson and financier Nat Rothschild. He achieved notoriety in 2008 after entertaining George Osborne on his luxury yacht, thereby creating a scandal about an alleged request for a political donation to the Conservative party before the last general election.</p>",
  "<p>During the US election, American voters are the most heavily polled in the world, with hardly a day passing this year without a new survey. They almost all pointed to the same conclusion: the 2012 White House race was nip and tuck. At least until now.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/26/romney-campaign-polls-obama-ohio\" title=\"\">latest polls show Barack Obama opening up big leads in the swing states</a>. With these most important battlegrounds tilting heavily against him, the Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, faces an uphill struggle to find a path through the electoral college system to the White House.</p> <p>Obama started the race with an advantage. Look at the electoral college map of the US and you see swaths of Republican red but most of these Republican states have relatively small populations, each delivering only a few electoral college votes.</p> <p>By contrast, Obama starts with many of the most heavily populated states in the bag: New York, California and Illinois were always going to vote Democratic.</p> <p>Add together all the solid Democratic states and those likely to vote Democratic and Obama starts the election with 237 electoral college votes, just 33 short of the magic victory number.</p> <p>For Romney, the route to the White House is tougher. Even with staunch support in the south and midwest, he started the race with only 191 in the bag.</p> <p>So the race comes down to eight swing states: Florida (29 electoral college votes), North Carolina (15), Virginia (13), New Hampshire (4), Ohio (18), Iowa (6), Colorado (9) and Nevada (6). The bad news for Romney is that as things stand, these offer Obama various routes to the White House.</p> <p>The widely respected political scientist Larry Sabato <a href=\"http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/\" title=\"\">shifted several swing states</a> that had been toss-ups over to Obamaon Thursday, pushing him well over the magic 270 electoral college votes needed to win.</p> <p>Sabato, a Virginia University politics professor, said he was not calling the race because there were still three presidential debates to come, and an international crisis or poor economic numbers could still change everything. \"So caution is always in order with almost six weeks to go, yet President Obama clearly leads at the moment,\" he said.</p> <p>If Obama was to take Florida, where the polls currently put him ahead, he would only need one other small state \u2013 even as small as New Hampshire or Iowa \u2013 to remain president. According to the latest state polls, Obama also enjoys a considerable lead in Ohio, a state which no Republican has lost and gone on to win the White House. If Obama wins both there and Florida, there is no way Romney can come back even if he won all six remaining battlegrounds.</p> <p>With six weeks to go everything could still theoretically change. Other presidential candidates have been trailing in polls before and gone on to win. Ronald Reagan was behind Jimmy Carter in September 1980 but went on to take the lead in October and eventually win easily in November.</p> <p>So if Romney won Florida \u2013 which is not inconceivable \u2013 the calculations would begin to look different. North Carolina should also be natural Republican territory. With those two, Romney would be on 235 to Obama's 237 and nervousness would begin to seep into Democratic ranks. Virginia, too, is traditionally Republican territory. Obama's win in the state in 2008 was a surprise and pundits predicted he would find it hard to hang on to.</p> <p>Although he was raised in Michigan, Romney's home state is Massachusetts and he has high hopes of taking neighbouring New Hampshire.</p> <p>Obama losing all the east coast swing states is a theoretical possibility. At that point, Democrats watching the results coming in at Obama headquarters in Chicago would be nervously waiting for Ohio, Iowa, Colorado and Nevada.</p> <p>But Sabato thinks such a scenario is unlikely. Virginia and North Carolina, according to his calculations, are no longer in contention. Only Florida and New Hampshire on the east coast and Colorado in the west, a total of 42 votes, are still in play.</p> <p>\"Provided Romney wins the three toss-ups, he will then need to pry another 22 electoral votes from Obama. And that will be difficult,\" Sabato said.</p>",
  "<p>Less than six weeks away from polling day, yesterday's US economic news was hardly what Barack Obama would have wished for. The growth figures for the second quarter were revised down and there was a 13.2% slump in orders for durable goods in August, normally seen as a good indicator or how well America's businesses are faring.</p> <p>The numbers were better than they looked. A drought unprecedented in its severity for half a century hit farm inventories in the three months to June, while the durable goods numbers are notoriously erratic. Boeing received only one order for a commercial aircraft in August having had 260 orders in July. There was also a big fall in orders for the defence industry.</p> <p>So, for Obama the good news is that if you dig deep into the numbers there is no need to panic. The bad news is that voters may take the figures at face value, and they look bad.</p>",
  "<p>And so, opprobrium is once more being&#xa0;heaped upon the permanently baseball-capped head of Lost in Showbiz's favourite rock star, Mike Love of the Beach Boys. This time, he&#xa0;is charged with <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-beach-boys-reunion-mike-love-tour-20120919,0,7915483.story\" title=\"\">unceremoniously sacking three members of the band</a> \u2013 including the band's creative leader (and Love's cousin) Brian Wilson, without whom it could be fairly uncontroversially argued there wouldn't actually be a Beach Boys for Mike Love to sack anybody from \u2013 prior to the end of a 50th-anniversary reunion tour. Instead, he will tour with&#xa0;his own version of the Beach Boys&#xa0;featuring his son, Christian Love. Demonstrating the shy charm for which he has become famed over the years, Love announced this by issuing a statement to the press, apparently without actually telling the people he was firing first. \"I'm disappointed and can't understand why he doesn't want to tour with Al, David and me,\" offered Wilson in response. \"We are out here having so much fun.\"</p> <p>Lost in Showbiz has been a huge fan&#xa0;of Love ever since it read the passage in Wilson's autobiography, Wouldn't It Be Nice? \u2013 which in fairness, it later transpired Wilson had never actually read, let alone written, but never mind \u2013 in which it was claimed Love had called all the Beach Boys to his hotel room's toilet during an early tour to look&#xa0;at a particularly big stool he&#xa0;had recently passed. Here, it&#xa0;thought, was a man not&#xa0;like other rock stars, a point subsequently proven on&#xa0;many occasions over the&#xa0;years.</p> <p>There were the&#xa0;endless, interminable lawsuits directed at&#xa0;his various fellow&#xa0;Beach Boys. The $5,000 seed money he donated to Tipper Gore's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parents_Music_Resource_Center\" title=\"\">Parent's Music Resource Center</a> campaign to&#xa0;censor and label albums in the mid-80s (he was the solitary major rock musician to support them). His <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nFKX98jagk\" title=\"\">remarkable tirade</a> at&#xa0;the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988. Performing with his&#xa0;version of the Beach Boys at a 2008&#xa0;Mitt Romney \"campaign reunion\" event in Houston that doubled as a fundraiser for John McCain, who had previously demonstrated his love of the Beach Boys' oeuvre <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9688222\" title=\"\">by singing \"bomb Iran\" to the tune of Barbara Ann&#xa0;</a>at an appearance in South Carolina. Lost in Showbiz looks at this&#xa0;remarkable legacy, notes&#xa0;also that&#xa0;Love planned to make an as-yet-unreleased solo album called&#xa0;either Unleash the Love or Mike&#xa0;Love, Not War and finds the words \"what a guy\" automatically rising to its lips.</p> <p>And rather than whinge and moan and protest about his latest outrage, LiS can only boggle in admiration at&#xa0;the sheer resilience of spirit and determination demonstrated by Love,&#xa0;who doesn't seem to have been in any way dented by the Nutty Jerry's debacle of June.</p> <p>This was an incident in which it transpired Love had already begun booking dates for his Brian Wilson-less&#xa0;version of the Beach Boys (\"news to me,\" remarked Wilson at the time) including one at <a href=\"http://www.nuttyjerrys.com/\" title=\"\">Nutty Jerry's Entertainment Complex</a>, in Winnie, Texas. Alas, for anyone hoping to enjoy one of&#xa0;Nutty Jerry's \"Off Da Hoof\" steaks to&#xa0;the strains of Do It Again, Nutty Jerry's cancelled the date, issuing a&#xa0;statement: \"The group that was scheduled to perform at Nutty Jerry's is not the same lineup as the current 'Beach Boys 50th Anniversary' tour. As&#xa0;a result Nutty Jerry's did not feel that we could advertise the show as the&#xa0;'original' Beach Boys.\"</p> <p>A lesser soul would have looked at this state of affairs and despaired: man,&#xa0;if even Nutty Jerry is bailing on my ersatz version of the Beach Boys, we're doomed. But as we have learned, Mike Love is a rock star unlike other men. Off he goes, metaphorically suggesting everybody come and look&#xa0;at&#xa0;his giant stool.</p>",
  "<p>\"The mainstream media is skewing its polls with too many Democrats because they want Obama to win.\"</p> <p>Statements like this one are <a href=\"http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2012/09/skewed_polls_indicate_obamas_in_trouble_-_not_romney.html\">zipping around</a> the internet a mile a minute these days. The general idea is that there are too many respondents identifying as Democrats in public surveys compared to past elections' exit polls. There's even a website titled <a href=\"http://www.unskewedpolls.com/\">unskewedpolls.com</a> that purports to adjust media polls to correct for these errors, based on Rasmussen Reports data. </p> <p>I have spent <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/17/weighting-polls-party-identification\">plenty of</a> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/01/bias-polls-harry-enten\">words</a> already debunking the use of party identification to dismiss a poll's results. Party ID is a fluid variable that can change for certain voters depending on their voting choice. Very few pollsters weight for party ID. A rare example might be if everything about a poll stayed steady from the previous ones, except for a sudden and drastic change in party identification for no apparent reason. Only under this scenario will some pollsters adjust their data.</p> <p>Recently, the \"too many Democrats\" chorus has reached a fever pitch. Many other polling pundits have <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/blog/electionate/107778/the-polls-dont-use-2008-turnout-model\">laughed off these complaints</a>. One went so far as to compare the proponents to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fivethirtyeight/status/250688713594658818\">9/11 conspiracy theorists</a>. </p> <p>Indeed, it is a ridiculous charge that the media purposely skews polls. If so, they have persuaded many Republicans to get in on the act. Polls from Fox News \u2013 an organization few would accuse of a pro-Democratic bias \u2013 have shown poor results for Romney. (Its polling is also partially run by the openly Republican <a href=\"http://shawresearch.com/shaw/Bio.html\">Daron Shaw</a>.) The NBC/Wall Street Journal national poll is part run by <a href=\"http://pos.org/about/partners-and-vice-presidents/bill-mcinturff-va/\">Bill McInturff</a>: a Republican, John McCain's own pollster, and professional partner to Mitt Romney's pollster. The GWU/Battleground poll has Republican pollster <a href=\"http://gspm.org/capedgoeas\">Ed Goeas</a> on board. The list goes on and on.</p> <p>However, just because the polls aren't purposely being manipulated doesn't mean the polls are infallibly right. <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/18/do-romneys-favorability-ratings-matter/\">One estimate</a> has the chance of Romney winning, if the election were held today, at about 2%. That's very small, but it's not 9/11 conspiracy territory, not even close. Put another way, the chance of the Mitt Romney winning, if the election were right now, is slightly better than <a href=\"http://www.nsawins.com/super-bowl-odds.shtml\">Vegas odds</a> of the Buffalo Bills winning the Super Bowl, and the Bills have a pretty good team.</p> <p>It's even less crazy to think that the current polling does not reflect the reality of what may happen in November. Estimates of Romney winning in November are higher, at somewhere between about <a href=\"http://votamatic.org/projecting-ahead-to-election-day/\">10%</a> and <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/18/do-romneys-favorability-ratings-matter/\">20%</a>. Again, these are low numbers, but they are not negligible.</p> <p>There are also reasons to believe that <a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/archive/mood_of_america_archive/partisan_trends/summary_of_party_affiliation\">Rasmussen Reports</a> will accurately forecast the party identification in the exit polls. Yes, Rasmussen remains a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/25/gallup-rasmussen-polling-outliers-lean-republican\">maverick figure</a> in much of the mainstream media, but take a look at how its partisan make-up in its three-month average before the election matched up against the exit polling since 2004.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396805059\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/27/1348764789893/exitpollsvrasmussen_220.jpg\" alt=\"Exit polls v Rasmussen\" width=\"220\" height=\"123\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Rasmussen actually comes fairly close to the result in every year. It has actually tended to overestimate the edge Democrats hold over Republicans in the party identification measured by the exit polls. It's rather amazing that even in a year where Rasmussen's final poll for the national House vote was 5 percentage points \"too Democratic\", its party identification was actually 2 percentage points \"too Democratic\".</p> <p>How is it possible that Rasmussen produced good data on party identification compared to the exit polls, but wasn't all that accurate? As I <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/17/weighting-polls-party-identification\">have pointed out</a>, party identification just isn't very predictive of what a poll will find. It's entirely possible that Rasmussen gets the party spread correct, but incorrectly predicts outcome. Indeed, there is pretty much no relationship between the spread across the candidates and party ID. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396805060\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/17/1347914038711/partyID_460.jpg\" alt=\"Obama lead v party ID\" width=\"460\" height=\"256\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>That's why Scott Rasmussen himself <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/rubycramer/conservatives-embrace-alternate-polling-reality\">has said</a> that you can't apply one firm's part identification to another firm's results and expect anything accurate to come of it. But let's say that, despite all these warnings, we still wanted to weight polls by party identification.</p> <p>It should noted that Pew Research also has a solid record with regard to party identification and the exit polls.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396805061\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/27/1348764817853/exitpollsvpew_220.jpg\" alt=\"Exit polls v Pew\" width=\"220\" height=\"134\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Pew also tends to have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ForecasterEnten/status/231503188505796610\">very consistent party identification</a> throughout the year. What Pew is showing now \u2013 a high <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2012/09/19/obama-ahead-with-stronger-support-better-image-and-lead-on-most-issues/\">single-digit lead for Democrats</a> on party identification \u2013 is likely what they will find in their final poll. </p> <p>We therefore have two pollsters with good track records showing very different party identification make-ups for the 2012 electorate. Should we choose Pew or Rasmussen?</p> <p>Pew does everything a pollster should do. They call cellphones and have very long survey periods to ensure an accurate representation of all parts of the American electorate, even those who might be difficult to reach. Pew was also <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/2010_generic_congressional_vote-2171.html\">correct in the 2010 midterm elections</a>, while Rasmussen was off. </p> <p>So, even if I were to weight by party ID, why would anyone choose Rasmussen over Pew? A statistical answer that doesn't approach conspiracy theory would be appreciated.</p> <p>What I'm trying to say is that there are reasons to believe Mitt Romney can still win this election. They don't start with using party ID to \"unskew\" the polling.</p>",
  "<p>You could call it the clash of the titans, though scrap between a community organiser and management consultant might be more accurate. Next Wednesday, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney face off in the first of three televised debates that could seal not only their personal fates, but also determine the future direction of the world's most powerful nation.</p> <p>For Obama, the encounter will be a chance to solidify the creeping lead he has gained over his rival during the past few weeks. He will aim finally to blow away the pall of doubt that has hung over his White House from the start: is he a one-term loser, a black Jimmy Carter? Or is he a titan, a two-term conqueror in the mould of Bill Clinton?</p> <p>For Romney, the stakes are if anything even higher. The 60 minutes of verbal combat in Denver, Colorado, may be his last chance to rescue a campaign that is certainly floundering and at times has looked close to disintegration.</p> <p>\"Romney comes into the debates needing some luck, needing Obama to make a mistake, needing to win the first debate,\" said Steve Schmidt, a prominent Republican strategist who, as John McCain's campaign chief in 2008, knows all about the pitfalls of a presidential run. \"He's on the edge of losing control over his own destiny.\"</p> <p>That the two men enter the final stretch of the 2012 presidential marathon with the election Obama's to lose and Romney's yet to win is not how it should have been. No sitting president since Franklin Roosevelt has won re-election with unemployment above 7.2%, and with today's jobless rate of 8.1% Obama should be the one with rope burns on his back.</p> <p>But in this election cycle we are watching conventional wisdom and historical precedent turned on their heads. The <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/us/general_election_romney_vs_obama-1171.html\" title=\"\">Real Clear Politics tracker poll of polls</a> has Obama four points ahead on 49% to Romney's 45%. More significantly, Obama has begun to pull away from Romney beyond the margin of error in the swing states that matter most.</p> <p>Recent polls show him in front in the seven states \u2013 Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin \u2013 that are most likely to determine November's outcome .</p> <p>Of those, Florida and Ohio represent, as they so often do, the golden fleece of this year's presidential election. Without their combined 47 electoral votes, Romney will almost certainly fail to put together the 270 needed to win.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.quinnipiac.edu/institutes-and-centers/polling-institute/presidential-swing-states-%28fl-oh-and-pa%29/release-detail?ReleaseID=1800\" title=\"\">new survey from the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute</a> gives Obama a 53%-to-44% lead over Romney in Florida and a similar 53%-to-43% advantage in Ohio. \"Romney is falling further behind and he's only got a few weeks left to make up ground,\" said Quinnipiac's analyst, Peter Brown.</p> <p>So how did we get to this point, where an election that for months has been too close to call has begun moving in Obama's direction? Not, it has to be said, with any of the soaring rhetoric and appeals to what's good in the American soul that distinguished Obama's first run for the highest office in 2008.</p> <p>At this point in 2008, millions of Americans were queuing around the block to enlist in the Obama army, brandishing their rising suns and chanting \"Yes we can!\" It was a time of great peril \u2013 Wall Street had just imploded \u2013 but also of great expectation that the coming presidential election would herald a new era.</p> <p>Four years later, the country is approaching its moment of truth in a starkly different frame of mind. Where 2008 felt as though the American giant was reawakening, this year we find it nursing its wounds in a gloomy cave. The mood of the electorate, made weary by the search for work or the fear of losing jobs, is as sour as it was euphoric back then.</p> <p>Take a look at the <a href=\"https://store.barackobama.com/? source=\" om2012_dd_g_store-search_general-store_||mkwid\"| gqimvs7s|kw|barack%20obama%20store|matchtype|p|pcrid| 13688195643|pl||&amp;gclid=\"CL-v0_bp1bICFcZlOgodznAA8A\" \" title=\"\">official store on the Obama for America website</a>. The merchandise on offer is uniformly corporate: there are badges for sale featuring the Obamas' dog, Bo (\"I Bark for Barack\"), silver Michelle brooches and a $95 Yigal Azrou\u00ebl scarf marked \"Made in the USA\". Gone is the exhilarating underground edginess of the 2008 campaign. Gone too is the single word that defined it: Hope.</p> <p>In its place we have an election that matches the current disposition of the electorate: restless, dissatisfied, grouchy. In Ohio, voters may be starting to fall in behind Obama, but they remain an angry crowd, disillusioned by politics and scathing of both presidential candidates. As one voter, Larry Bushnell in northern Ohio, put it to the Guardian: \"I think they both suck, honestly. They'll lie to get your vote.\"</p> <p>With 39 days to go, that crankiness will continue to be the dominant chord of this election. Over the next five weeks we will hear the candidates and their backers trade yet more insults, see an avalanche of negative TV adverts bear down upon already cheesed-off voters, listen to the endless was-it-a-gaffe/wasn't-it-a-gaffe commentary of the 24-hour news channels. It will be brutal, and it will be ugly.</p> <p>But it will be vital. Obama was right when <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/09/06/160713941/ transcript-president-obamas-convention-speech\" title=\"\">he said in his nomination speech</a> in North Carolina earlier this month that Americans face \"the clearest choice of any time in a generation\".</p> <p>In Obama's blue corner of the ring, we have his bloodied but as yet unbowed vision of a collective future for America, in which government has a role to play in regulating the excesses of corporations, alleviating poverty and encouraging innovation.</p> <p>Putting a spin on JFK's famous invocation \"ask not what your country can do for you\", Obama crystallised his position at the Democratic National Convention by saying: \"As citizens, we understand that America is not about what can be done for us, it's about what can be done by us, together.\"</p> <p>In the red corner of the ring, there is the paradox of the Romney campaign. The former governor of Massachusetts has flip-flopped on an almost metronomic basis, to the extent that it is virtually impossible to clearly define his political convictions.</p> <p>All that can be said with certainty is that he goes to the ballot in November on a ticket that is dramatically to the right of George Bush and even to the right of John McCain, who had his own flip-flopping issues. In fact, much of the Romney position conforms to the extreme fiscal conservatism of the Tea Party.</p> <p>His promises to rein back government, to cut taxes, including for the very rich, to stage another bonfire of regulations of the sort that put America in the hole from which it is still trying to emerge, to repeal Obama's healthcare reforms that will extend medical insurance to many of the 47 million uninsured \u2013 all these are classic Tea Party policies. Even his vice-presidential running mate, Paul Ryan, is steeped in the anti-government ideology of the movement.</p> <p>That's one way to parse the importance of 6 November: can Obama stop the Tea Party taking possession of the White House? Another way of articulating the vital, almost existential, urgency of this election is that nothing less than the wellbeing of America's democracy is at stake.</p> <p>If that sounds melodramatic, consider this: Romney's outside fundraising body or \"Super Pac\", called Restore Our Future, has no fewer than 25 billionaires on its list of donors. Sheldon Adelson, a Las Vegas casino magnate, has alone injected almost $40m into this election cycle in favour of Republican candidates and may approach $100m before it's done. Emboldened by the two court rulings in 2010 (<em>Citizens United v Federal Election Commission</em> and <em>Speechnow.org v Federal Election Commission</em>) that removed any barriers from the investment of corporate, union or private money into elections, Adelson and other mega-wealthy donors will have pumped in close to $500m come November. That in turn will bring the total cost of putting one man into the White House to a dizzying total of $2.5bn.</p> <p>\"Wealthy donors are injecting money into the electoral process at a level we have never seen before,\" said Bob Biersack, who tracks the influence of cash in politics at the Centre for Responsive Politics. \"The danger is that this will swing the balance of power, effectively disenfranchising the majority of Americans.\"</p> <p>It is another measure of how Obama is bucking the trend this year that this vast mobilisation of billionaires' funds has so far failed to have the impact they desired. The blitzkrieg of TV advertising that their money has afforded, portraying Obama as a European socialist intent on burying the American dream under a pile of government bureaucracy, has not yet turned the voter against the president. With less than six weeks to go to election day, it seems the American people cannot be bought as easily as Adelson and his peers assume.</p> <p>Obama has fought off the march of Big Money partly by transmitting a positive message to voters of who he is and where he stands. His convention was a master-class in political communications, replete with a lecture from the master himself, Bill Clinton. With his help, Obama made the case that the continuing hardship felt by many Americans was not a reflection of his own failed policies, as the Republicans contest, but rather a sign that he needs more time to get the job finished. \"It will take more than a few years for us to solve challenges that have built up over decades,\" he said.</p> <p>The 2012 election was always going to be about the economy, and it remains Obama's most vulnerable point. But in this crucial area the Obama re-election campaign has coolly refused to be cowed by the Republican assault and calmly turned the argument back against them: the economic meltdown happened on the Republicans' watch; Romney opposed the bailout of the car manufacturers; though the economy still falters, the stock exchange is robust; and house prices are beginning to recover.</p> <p>Those arguments have played well in battlegrounds like Ohio, where Obama's role in having saved the auto industry resonates among its thousands of car parts and distribution outlets. The state has a jobless rate of 7.2%, notably below the national average.</p> <p>Across the country, the anxious electorate appear to have been listening. This week's Quinnipiac poll records that for the first time since it began following the Obama-Romney race, the president has come out on top on the economy. Some 51% of likely voters said that Obama would do a better job on the economy to Romney's 46%.</p> <p>Obama has also delivered a positive message on his healthcare reforms. While committed Republican voters continue to see \"Obamacare\" as a socialist Trojan horse, for many middle-of-the-road Americans, worried about losing their jobs and hence their health insurance, the promise of affordable medical cover for all sounds increasingly attractive.</p> <p>On foreign policy, too, Obama has rammed home the incumbent's advantage. At the Democratic convention he was profuse in his praise of the military, rebutting Romney's jibes that he was an apologist for his country by donning the uniform of the commander in chief.</p> <p>References to the president's overwhelming foreign affairs achievement were kept to a minimum, but who needs quantity when you have the quality of John Kerry's TV-friendly jingle: \"Ask Osama bin Laden if he's better off now than he was four years ago.\"</p> <p>But these positive messages are only a small part of the ruthless effectiveness of the Obama re-election machine. Campaign strategist David Axelrod and his Chicago-based spin wizards have primarily gone negative, weaving a straitjacket for Romney that has constricted his every move.</p> <p>While Romney and his conservative rivals were slugging it out with each other for the Republican nomination, the Obama team were quietly working behind the scenes to define Romney's biography. In a series of attack ads aired remorselessly in the swing states, they painted him as a rich kid born with a silver spoon in his mouth who had no affinity with the daily trials of the middle classes, destroyed ordinary people's lives as head of Bain Capital, and was so arrogant that he wouldn't declare his taxes.</p> <p>Quinnipiac's Peter Brown, who as a polling analyst sides with neither of the two main parties, says he has never witnessed such a successful character assassination in a presidential race. \"They have turned Romney into a wealthy, out-of-touch elitist, who is just not someone the average voter wants to have a beer with.\"</p> <p>Republican strategist Steve Schmidt believes the rot set in earlier this year when the Romney campaign made the mistake of conserving its war chest rather than investing it aggressively in a counter-offensive. Inexplicably, in his view, the Republican candidate was unprepared for the onslaught; he was caught off guard by the furore over his tax returns and was ill-equipped to defend himself on Bain Capital \u2013 a bizarre weakness given that Romney's record at the firm has been a political thorn in his side right back to his 1994 duel with Ted Kennedy for a US senate seat.</p> <p>In Schmidt's opinion, Romney made the basic error of seeing the election as a referendum on Obama's four years in office and not as a choice between two conflicting political visions: \"The Romney campaign was premised on the notion that Obama could not be re-elected with unemployment as high as it was and pessimism running in the country as high as it was. All that Mitt Romney had to do was to hold steady and the electorate would come to him.\"</p> <p>It didn't. Since the start of the presidential election proper this month, Romney's malaise has only deepened. Everything he has done since, according to Schmidt, \"has been the opposite of what he needed to do to get over the plausibility bar, so that people look at him and see him as a commander-in-chief.\"</p> <p>First he forgot to mention Afghanistan and returning war heroes in his convention speech \u2013 an astonishing error from the party that claims to own national security. Then he made hasty remarks about the death of the US ambassador in Libya.</p> <p>And to cap it all, there was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/18/romney-secret-video-government-dependent\" title=\"\">the \"47 per cent\" gaffe.</a> In remarks made before donors paying $50,000 per plate, he essentially accused almost half the nation of being lazy no-hopers suffering from a victim complex and languishing in the pocket of the president.</p> <p>Given that litany of horrors, Romney faces huge difficulties as he goes into Wednesday night. This race is not over: there is time yet for an upset. But the challenger from Massachusetts must access hidden strengths if he is to appear on 7&#xa0;November looking like a titan and not a mouse.</p>",
  "<p>The fragile state of the US's economic recovery was thrown into focus once more Thursday as the government announced growth was slowing and orders for long-lasting goods plunged in August, the latest sign of a weakening manufacturing sector.</p> <p>US gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 the broadest measure of the economy \u2013 grew at an annual rate of 1.3% between April and June, the commerce department said Thursday. The figure was revised down from a previously reported 1.7% gain.</p> <p>Meanwhile the commerce department said durable goods orders fell 13.2% last month, the largest fall since January 2009. The measure of orders for goods designed to last three months or more is a key indicator of economic growth. </p> <p>The decrease followed three consecutive monthly increases including a 3.3% rise in July. August's figure was a seasonally adjusted $198.49bn, the lowest dollar figure since February 2011, and far below most economists predictions.</p> <p>The collapse was driven in large part by by declining transportation orders, particularly for aircraft. Transportation equipment orders fell 34.9% following four consecutive monthly increases. Orders for civilian aircraft plunged. Boeing received 260 orders in July and just one in August. Australia's Qantas airline cancelled an $8.5bn order with Boeing in August, triggering a net decline in new orders for the month. Motor-vehicle and parts orders dropped 10.9%. Outside of transportation, August orders slid 1.6%.</p> <p>But not all the news was bad. Non-defence capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched barometer of business spending plans, rose 1.1% after falling for the previous two months. The increase was above economists' expectations for 0.5% gain.</p> <p>Paul Dales, senior economist at Capital Economics, said the aircraft figures had skewed the latest figures but they still showed the fundamental weakness of the US's recovery.</p> <p>\"It's not as nasty as it looks but it's still quite dire,\" he said. \"There is a downward trend, whether businesses are worried about the global outlook or US fiscal issues isn't clear but there is clearly some concern,\" he said.</p> <p>Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG, said: \"Yes 1.3% growth is worse than 1.7% but the larger story is that growth in the second quarter was really bad.\" He said cuts in government spending were a major drag on the economy but it was also clear that consumers and businesses were also becoming more cautious.</p> <p>The figures came as the latest weekly number for people claiming unemployment insurance for the first time fell sharply. Some 359,000 people filed for jobless benefits for the first time in the week ending last Saturday, down 26,000 from the previous week, the labor department said.</p> <p>The number is close to the 350,000 economists see as a benchmark for recovery in the jobs market. The less volatile four-week average was 374,000, down 4,500 from the previous week. Next week the monthly nonfarm payroll report will give a wider snapshot of the US jobs market. The closely watched indicator has become a monthly flashpoint in the 2012 election.</p> <p>The latest economic figures present arguments for both sides with the presidential election just weeks away.</p> <p>In his latest TV ads President Barack Obama claims the economy is \"moving forward again\", after reminding viewers of the depth of the economic crisis the country faced when he took office.</p> <p>\"It's time for a new economic patriotism, rooted in the belief that growing our economy begins with a strong, thriving middle class,\" says Obama. \"Read my plan. Compare it to Governor Romney's and decide for yourself.\"</p> <p>Romney and his vice-presidential pick Paul Ryan have stepped up their attacks on the president. In an interview with 60 Minutes last Sunday Romney said a vote for Obama was a vote for continued economic woes and higher deficits.</p>",
  "<p>At the Liberal Democrat conference, Nick Clegg was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/sep/25/lib-dem-conference-live-blog-alexander?intcmp=239#block-50616e3f58f9bdd2eeba01c7\" title=\"\">complimentary about Ed Miliband</a>, saying: \"He's approachable \u2026 He's got a perfectly good sense of humour. He's a civilised human being.\" Friendly words indeed; but it's likely that, after the next election, Miliband will have good reason to be even more complementary about Clegg in return. Why? Because the main reason Labour is on course to win in 2015 is that Clegg's lurch to the right has created a mass exodus of Lib Dem voters to Labour. The latest <a href=\"http://image.theguardian.com/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/09/22/Opiniumpoll.jpg\" title=\"\">Observer/Opinium poll</a> shows that about 40% of people who voted Lib Dem in 2010 now back Labour, while only a third would vote Lib Dem again. Labour is currently polling 10 to 15 percentage points above its 2010 vote share; about two-thirds of that increase is due to disaffected Lib Dem switchers.</p> <p>If the shift from Lib Dems to Labour in 2015 occurs on this scale, it will mean that Clegg has achieved the holy grail of the British left for 40 years: the reunification of the left. The last Labour leader to achieve a working parliamentary majority with an unadulterated social democratic manifesto was Harold Wilson in 1966. Following Labour's 1970 defeat, the emergence of the Liberal party as a centrist \"third force\" made it impossible for Labour to win a working majority. The 1981 SDP breakaway from Labour, and the subsequent Liberal/SDP Alliance, exacerbated the \"split left\" problem. The main explanation for Conservative domination of British politics under Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, and then John Major's surprise 1992 election win, was a divided opposition paying the price under the first-past-the-post electoral system.</p> <p>The continuing presence of the Liberal Democrats as a centre-left alternative to Labour in the 1990s forced Tony Blair to take a different path to victory from Wilson, by shifting many aspects of Labour's policy platform far enough rightwards to attract floating Tory voters. The drawback of this strategy was that the need not to alienate these centre-right converts meant that New Labour in office was often disconcertingly rightwing, alienating its core vote. Hence, the Lib Dems under Charles Kennedy's leadership carved out an electoral niche to the left of Labour on many issues \u2013 the Iraq war, civil liberties and student tuition fees, for instance.</p> <p>Clegg's election as leader in 2007 signalled the beginning of the end of the Lib Dems as a left-of-centre party. At first, few people noticed; their 23% vote share in 2010 was due to a combination of left-leaning and right-leaning voters.</p> <p>However, as soon as the party went into coalition with the Conservatives, Clegg proceeded to adopt a policy platform almost indistinguishable from his Tory coalition partners on many key issues \u2013 for example backing George Osborne's self-defeating austerity programme, extensive welfare cuts, a VAT hike paid for by income tax cuts which largely benefit middle- and high-income earners, and marketising public services.</p> <p>For sure, differences between the Conservatives and Lib Dems remain \u2013 most obviously on Europe and consititutional reform. But Clegg has fundamentally altered the electoral calculus of UK politics; the split left of the last 40 years has been replaced by a split right. The rightwing vote \u2013 at least in England and Wales \u2013 is now split between three very different but clearly right-of-centre parties: the Tories, the Liberal Democrats and Ukip.</p> <p>By contrast, the leftwing vote in England is almost completely unified under Labour (bar a few percentage points for the Greens). While under a proportional voting system the right might be able to construct a coalition from some combination of the Tories, Ukip and Lib Dems, under first past the post \u2013 particularly on the current boundaries, which are now here to stay after the Tories rejected House of Lords reform \u2013 it looks highly likely that Labour will win in 2015.</p> <p>Moreover, Miliband can win with little or no assistance from voters defecting from the Tories \u2013 a luxury Tony Blair never enjoyed. What this means is that, rather than rehashing the New Labour triangulation strategy of tacking to the centre-right, Labour can instead focus on building a genuine left-of-centre coalition by offering policies that appeal to traditional Labour voters while also catering for disaffected left-leaning ex-Lib Dems.</p> <p>None of this ensures that the next Labour government will actually be a success. Economic circumstances will be very challenging, and the British public, weary after years of falling living standards, will have a low tolerance for any Labour administration that fails to deliver Miliband's \"responsible capitalism\" effectively. Nonetheless, it is a strange irony of British politics that the politician who has done most in the last three years to deliver a Labour victory in 2015 is Clegg.</p>",

If it works, and the Lib Dems remain in government after 2015 (at a conference fringe I heard one speaker joking about young people in 2020 talking about having lived all their adult lives \"under a Lib Dem government), Clegg will be seen as one of the great political figures of our age.

Stubborn and principled, they ignored the cynics who mocked them. They simply refused to give up on their dreams. They refused to accept that Liberals would never again be in government. And they refused to accept that Liberalism, that most decent, enlightened and British of creeds, which did so much to shape our past, would not shape our future. We think we\u2019ve got it tough now. But it was much, much tougher in their day. It was only their resolve, their resilience and their unwavering determination that kept the flickering flame of Liberalism alive through our party\u2019s darkest days.</p> <p>At our last conference in Gateshead, I urged you to stop looking in the rear view mirror as we journey from the party of opposition that we were, to the party of government we are becoming. But before we head off on the next stage of our journey, I want you to take one last look in that mirror to see how far we\u2019ve come. I tell you what I see.</p> <p>I see generations of Liberals marching towards the sound of gunfire. And yes, I see them going back to their constituencies to prepare for government. It took us a while but we got there in the end.</p> </blockquote> <p>Younger colleagues were wondering why Clegg started going on about \"the sound of gunfire\".

They never flinched, and nor should we. We owe it to them to seize the opportunity they gave us, but which they never had. Taking on the vested interests. Refusing to be bullied. Refusing to give up. Always overturning the odds. Fighting for what we believe in, because we know that nothing worthwhile can be won without a battle. A fair, free and open society. That\u2019s the prize.

It's embargoed until 3pm, which means I'm now free to publish. So, here goes...</p> <p>Here are the main points from the speech.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Clegg said he would not allow the top rate of income tax to be cut below 45% during this parliament.</strong> When George Osborne announced it was being cut from 50% to 45% in the spring budget, many Tories expressed the hope that this would be the first step towards getting it down to 40%, the level it used to be before Labour raised it during the credit crunch. Osborne reportedly wanted to take it down to 40% in one go. But Clegg said he would not accept any further change before 2015.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Now that we have brought the top rate of tax down to 45p \u2013 a level, let\u2019s not forget, that is still higher than throughout Labour\u2019s 13 years in office \u2013 there can be no question of reducing it further in this parliament. All future cuts in personal taxation must pass one clear test: do they help people on low and middle incomes get by and get on? It\u2019s as simple as that.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 But he defended the decision to cut the top rate of income tax from 50% to 45% in the spring budget.</strong> He said he had \u201cinsisted\u201d on getting an increase in the tax allowance into the budget and that he had \u201cconceded\u201d the top rate tax cut. But he said he stood by the decision as a whole.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Why? Because as liberals, we want to see the tax on work reduced, the tax on unearned wealth increased, and the system as a whole tilted in favour of those on low and middle incomes. The budget delivered all three.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He announced that Paddy Ashdown will return to the Lib Dem frontline, taking charge of the party's 2015 election campaign.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can announce today that Paddy Ashdown has agreed to front up our campaign as chair of the 2015 general election team. I must admit, I\u2019m not quite sure I\u2019m ready for all those urgent emails and 5am phone calls. But I can\u2019t think of anyone I\u2019d rather have by my side. Paddy, it\u2019s great to have you back.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the Lib Dems should stop speculating about what they might do in the event of a hung parliament because this was ultimately a decision for the electorate.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There\u2019s been a lot of discussion on the fringe of this conference about our party\u2019s next steps; about our relationship with the other parties; and about what we should do in the event of another hung parliament. It\u2019s the sort of discussion politicians love \u2013 full of speculation and rumour. But I have to tell you, it is all based on a false, and deeply illiberal, assumption: that it is we, rather than the people, who get to decide. In a democracy, politicians take their orders from the voters.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He claimed that the Lib Dems were the only party who could be trusted on the economy and trust to deliver a fairer society.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He accused Labour, and particularly Ed Balls, of financial irresponsibility</strong>. Balls was mentioned three times, while Ed Miliband was not mentioned at all. Clegg claimed that the poor suffered the most as a result of Labour's mismanagement of the economy.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Labour may have thought it was funny, after crashing the economy and racking up record debts, to leave a note on David Laws\u2019 desk saying: \u201cthere\u2019s no money left\u201d. But it\u2019s no joke for the most vulnerable in our society; the people Labour claim to represent but let down the most. So let\u2019s take no more lectures about betrayal. It was Labour who plunged us into austerity and it is we, the Liberal Democrats, who will get us out.</p> </blockquote> <p>And he accused Balls of offering \u201ca fantasy world where there is no 'boom and bust' and the money never runs out\u201d.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He also attacked Conservatives who believe deregulation is the best solution to the country's economic problems.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The idea that if government just deregulated a bit more as Liam Fox proposes, or borrowed and spent a bit more as Ed Balls proposes, we would, at a stroke, achieve strong and lasting growth, is just not credible. In my experience, if you\u2019re being attacked by Liam Fox from one side, and Ed Balls from the other, you\u2019re in the right place.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that the government was willing to act \u201cagain and again and again\u201d to get growth going.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If Plan A really was as rigid and dogmatic as our critics claim, I\u2019d be demanding a Plan B, and getting Danny and Vince to design it. But it isn\u2019t. Which is why you were right, earlier this week, to overwhelmingly reject the call for us to change our economic course. We have taken big and bold steps to support demand and boost growth. And we stand ready to do so again and again and again until self-sustaining growth returns.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He launched a veiled attack on the Conservatives for not fully supporting green growth.</strong> The Lib Dems would \u201chold [the Conservatives] to their promises\u201d on the environment, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We will not succeed in this last task unless we can see off that most short-sighted of arguments: that we have to choose between going green and going for growth. Decarbonising our economy isn\u2019t just the right thing to do; it\u2019s a fantastic economic opportunity.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that austerity was essential because, if Britain lost control of its finances, it would lose its independence</strong>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the coming years, some countries will get their own house in order. But some will not. Those that do will continue to write their own budgets, set their own priorities and shape their own futures. But those that do not will find their right to self-determination withdrawn by the markets, and new rules imposed by their creditors, without warning or clemency.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He suggested that welfare spending was too high.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One of the things about governing is it forces you to confront the inconvenient truths oppositions choose to ignore. Like the fact that, over the last 50 years, our economy has grown threefold, but our welfare spending is up sevenfold.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He defined liberalism as giving people \u201cthe freedom to be who you are, the opportunity to be who you could be\u201d.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the Lib Dems must give up being a party of protest.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I know that there are some in the party \u2013 some in this hall even \u2013 who, faced with several more years of spending restraint, would rather turn back than press on. Break our deal with the Conservatives, give up on the coalition, and present ourselves to the electorate in 2015 as a party unchanged. It\u2019s an alluring prospect in some ways. Gone would be the difficult choices, the hard decisions, the necessary compromises. And gone too would be the vitriol and abuse, from right and left, as we work every day to keep this government anchored in the centre ground.</p> <p>But conference, I tell you this. The choice between the party we were, and the party we are becoming, is a false one. The past is gone and it isn\u2019t coming back. If voters want a party of opposition \u2013 a \u201cstop the world I want to get off\u201d party \u2013 they\u2019ve got plenty of options, but we are not one of them. There\u2019s a better, more meaningful future waiting for us. Not as the third party, but as one of three parties of government.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He confirmed that the government would give secondary schools a \u201ccatch-up premium\u201d, allowing them to spend \u00a3500 on help for children arriving from primary who are behind in English or maths.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that extremists could take over in the west if governments responded in the wrong way to the threat posed by the global power shift.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The potential consequences of this shift in power, should we in the west fail to respond, cannot be overstated. Our influence in the world, our standard of living, our ability to fund our public services and maintain our culture of openness and tolerance \u2013 all are in the balance. For power would move not only away from the liberal and democratic world, but within it too; from moderates to hardliners, from internationalists to isolationists, from those committed to the politics of cooperation to those hell-bent on confrontation. If history has taught us anything, it is that extremists thrive in tough times.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He attacked the \u201cculture of instant celebrity\u201d.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For most people, success doesn\u2019t come easy or quick. That\u2019s what our culture of instant celebrity obscures: that real achievement in the real world takes time, effort, perseverance, resilience.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-26T14:39:52.662Z\">at 3.39pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-506308f6c0e327c3f7c905f6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-26T13:53:58.777Z\">2.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here's Elaine Woodard, from Meon Valley.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;460&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8JZYdFe5Tfc&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-506308b058f9bdd2eeba0288\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-26T13:52:48.832Z\">2.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My colleague <strong>Helene Mulholland</strong> has been talking to delegates about how the conference has gone.

Or not. \"Does it work, or if it does work does it have so many negative consequences we shouldn't do it any more?\" posed Cable. \"At some point in the next few months the question will arise, unless growth spontaneously returns, do you do more of it, [and] how do you do it?\"</p> <p>At the same event, John Cridland, the CBI's director general, suggested the major employers' and industrialists' group was open to the government committing to a target to decarbonise the UK's power sector by 2030 - a major commitment which would mean, effectively, that no gas, oil or coal plants could be used to generate electricity in less than two decades time unless still untenable technology was developed to capture and store the carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>Asked if the CBI would support the target being included in the up-coming Electricity Market Reform bill, Cridland repllied: \"I'm not yet persuaded, but that doesn't mean I'm against it.\" If the CBI was satisfied that including the target would not create \"target fatigue\" and would not delay the bill, \"I'd look at it again\", he added.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-64dc14b6-d64e-4d5c-9471-6703f14f7d1f\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/26/1348665983427/3b65d812-6578-4b73-88be-0d883e3ce1fa-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Vince Cable listens on as Jo Swinson addresses the conference.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vince Cable sits as Jo Swinson addresses the conference.

But this was not what his committee had found: \"I think there is an interesting question which will arise at some point, which is what Charles Farr has been telling Theresa May everybody is saying to him. I presented a summary of what a lot of the companies we met were saying, and Theresa May said: 'No, they're all entirely happy with this. They've all seen it, and they're quite comfortable.' I said: 'Well, that's not what they're saying,' and she said, 'Well, they must be lying to you.'</p> <p>\"I've spoken now to probably about 15 different companies, and, you know, maybe they are all lying to me, I don't know, but they're lying on record as well, so \u2026 \"</p> <p>Huppert added that \"foreign powers, all sorts of groups would like to get hold of this\" data, and asked delegates: \"How many people here would be prepared to carry a tag which reported on where you were every five minutes?\" Holding up his phone, he said: \"We do.\"</p> <p>Home Office minister Jeremy Browne suggested Huppert should \"not pre-empt the process\", and admitted his curiosity was \"less naturally aroused than Julian's in this area\". But he said that \"from the party's point of view it seems to me there is quite a lot of prevailing opinion that we have to be very mindful of the civil liberties concerns while also not being dismissive of some of the benefits Julian has mentioned\" - for example finding out who a murder victim or missing child had been speaking to before being killed or disappearing.</p> <p>Huppert said he also hoped \"we can salvage some of it [the bill]\" for the same reasons.</p> <p>But Browne alarmed the Lib Dem faithful when he attempted to illustrate the balance between state power and individual liberty by giving the example of an \"elderly widow living in fear of marauding teenage gangs\".

So here we go - my list of 10 things we've learnt from the Lib Dem conference.</p> <p><strong>1. Nick Clegg is trying to forge the Liberal Democrats into a new party \u2013 but his creation is on electoral life-support and it is not yet clear whether it has a viable future.</strong> The Lib Dems used to be a receptacle for the protest vote, buoyed by the hope that electoral reform would eventually give them 100-plus seats in the Commons, but now the protest vote is going elsewhere and, with PR and Lords reform (backdoor PR) off the agenda for years, Clegg is trying to turn the Lib Dems into a mainstream party that can win by first-past-the-post. As Matthew d'Ancona put it <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/nick-clegg/9544637/Cleggmania-is-now-nothing-but-a-distant-memory.html\">in a column recently,</a> he wants \u201cnothing less than to create a third party of government; not an electoral dumping ground for the Undecideds, the Outraged and People Who Still Hate Blair, but a party ready to participate in future coalitions and bring its own distinctive approach to bear on government\u201d. Unfortunately, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/liberaldemocrats/9493952/Lib-Dems-face-near-wipeout-in-2015-poll-warns.html\">with the polls as they are, </a>this new entity could face virtual electoral wipeout in 2015.</p> <p><strong>2. The Lib Dems seem more committed to ever to the coalition.</strong> This seems strange, given the fact that the decision to go into coalition has led to their collapse in the polls, but the party seems to have realised that it has past the point of no return. It may not know where its journey will end up, but the bridge back to April 2010 is in cinders. The clearest sign of this came when the party endorsed the coalition's key economic strategy, decisively rejecting a call for a Plan B. Clegg also made the point convincingly <a href=\"http://www.libdems.org.uk/speeches_detail.aspx?title=Nick_Clegg%E2%80%99s_rally_speech_at_Liberal_Democrat_Autumn_Conference&amp;pPK=ccad70de-e202-43a8-8778-27555c5e6503\">in his speech to the conference rally on Saturday night.</a> \u201cThis is the first time anyone in modern Britain has experienced a national coalition government,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must show them it is a form of government that works well for them. If we don\u2019t we will have lost not only the argument for having Liberal Democrats in power but for having a third party at all.\u201d In other words, the Lib Dems face an existential threat, and if the coalition fails, the Lib Dems are doomed too.</p> <p><strong>3. The Lib Dems are seeking to reassert their identity \u2013 and the mansion tax, civil liberties and green growth at the heart of it</strong>. Although events have run relatively smoothly on the conference floor, the realisation that the Lib Dems will have to fight an election as a party of government for the first time has triggered an intense debate about the party's identity that has overshadowed events on the fringe. The most provocative contribution came from Richard Reeves, Clegg's former director of strategy, <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/politics/2012/09/case-truly-liberal-party\">whose appeal for undiluted liberalism</a> was seen as an attempt to push the party to the right, but many Lib Dems strongly disagree (see <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/sep/26/nick-clegg-lib-dem-conference-live#block-5062b2d758f9bdd2eeba0249\">8.46am)</a> and think the party would be mad to give up on leftish voters who are attracted by the party's social democratic instincts. The Lib Dems have not resolved the right/left argument, but this week has shown members can unite around three themes: taxing the wealthy (the mansion tax has been championed ad nauseam), defending civil liberties (the leadership got trounced on secret courts, in the best debate on the conference) and green growth (which has become a key dividing line with the Tories).</p> <p><strong>4. Clegg intends to fight the next election.</strong> Clegg has always said he intends to fight the next election, but now, for the first time, people like me are starting to believe that he really means it. Partly that's because of his decision to issue his apology, which would not make much sense if he was planning to abandon ship in 2014. And partly because it's because people who know him well seem to be increasingly certain that he is going to stay on. Sometimes it's the gossip that is particularly persuasive. In the past there were suggestions that his wife Miriam wanted Clegg to stand down before 2015, but <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/sep/22/lib-dem-conference-live-blog-2012#block-505db576c0e38ada80016272\">at the weekend the Financial Times reported that she's opposed to Clegg taking a job in Brussels,</a> because she has decided that the city is too provincial.</p> <p><strong>5. There will be no imminent leadership challenge.</strong> Clegg's personal ratings are dire, but there has been no serious challenge to his leadership <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/sep/26/nick-clegg-lib-dem-conference-live#block-5062b2d758f9bdd2eeba0249\">(Lembit Opik doesn't count)</a> and for the moment his position is perfectly safe. But it might be different in 2013, and as for 2014 \u2013 book your tickets for the conference now. If Clegg has not already suffered an attempt to depose him by then, 2014 should be the moment for a showdown.</p> <p><strong>6. Vince Cable is the party's undisputed leader-in-waiting.</strong> Cable has not done anything disloyal in Brighton, but he used his speech on Monday to advertise his availability, and his credentials as someone who could work with Labour or the Tories, and, with a clutch of polls showing that the party would do better under his leadership, he is now, for the moment, the overwhelming favourite to succeed Clegg. Tim Farron's prospects seem dimmer than they did last year and Chris Huhne \u2013 whose absence leaves Lib Dem firepower much weaker than it was \u2013 is of course, er, otherwise engaged.</p> <p><strong>7. Election manifestos are going to look different in the future because they will clearly differentiate between non-negotiable promises and negotiable ones.</strong> The Lib Dem tuition fee experience, and Clegg's apology, has focused attention on how the party can avoid this problem in the future. \u201cAll parties will need to be more upfront with the British people on what 'tablet of stone' stuff, and the other [promises] that will depend on circumstances,\u201d Clegg said yesterday.</p> <p><strong>8. Coalition government is making government more open.</strong> In the past ministers used to row in private and defend their collective decisions in public. When the coalition launched the two parties tried to play down their differences in public, but now Clegg and his colleagues are so open about their differences with their Tory colleagues that, as this week has demonstrated, it has almost stopped being a story. Danny Alexander proposed a motion implicitly attacking his boss, George Osborne, and the media barely batted an eyelid. Conversations that used to take place behind closed doors are now being conducted in public. It's a notable shift in Whitehall culture.</p> <p><strong>9. The Lib Dems are still overwhelmingly white and male.</strong> The party has no ethnic minority MPs and there seem to be very few ethnic minority delegates at the conference. We have not had a speech from a high-profile Lib Dem woman, although Jo Swinson <a href=\"http://markreckons.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/jo-swinson-could-be-our-next-leader.html\">(who is being tipped as a future leader) </a>may fill the gap when she speaks. In diversity terms, this party has a very long way to go.</p> <p><strong>10. But it's a great party to join if you want to speak at a party conference.</strong> This week has confirmed that the Lib Dems are still the only main party in British politics who are genuinely comfortable about letting their members debate politics. Labour and the Tories use their conferences to showcase their leaders and their rising stars. If you want to go to party conference, and get involved in debates and speak repeatedly, I'm afraid you haven't got much option. You'll have to join the Lib Dems.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-26T11:47:56.335Z\">at 12.47pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5062db8dc0e327c3f7c905d8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-26T10:40:13.359Z\">11.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's more on the planning vote.

It will actually slow it down. You just wonder what planet some of these people are on. <br>\"Just for once these parliamentarians should listen to the little people on the district councils who actually know most about this. Just listen to them and take these stupid ideas away.\" <br>Richard Fagence, from Windsor, Berkshire, said: \"This is not just a mistake, in my opinion. This is a huge mistake. <br>\"Don't even get me started on extensions. <br>\"My back garden is wider than it is deep, if you see what I mean. It's about 32ft deep but you could now develop an extension 26ft deep in old money. <br>\"The motion calls on the coalition government to withdraw these proposals. I would add one word to that: immediately.\" <br>Prue Bray, from Wokingham, Berkshire, said: \"This is not the first coalition policy forced on the party. <br>\"We know in coalition we cannot have everything we want. We understand the need for confidentiality in government. <br>\"But surely it is not beyond us as a party to come up with a better way for the party and parliamentarians to work together so we can avoid situations like this?\" <br>Tim Ward, from Cambridge, said the plans were \"both unnecessary and damaging\". <br>\"Every time one of these daft ideas arrives from government, I have to direct one of my senior officer to researching, analysing and responding to the consultation,\" he said. <br>\"I have an officer working on this as we speak.

I thought it was because party conferences are increasingly dominated by lobbyists, rather than activists, but <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/danielfinkelstein/article3549498.ece\">in the Times today (paywall) Daniel Finkelstein suggests that there's a wider problem, which relates to the way politics is changing.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Once these events in seaside towns were the gathering places of the representatives of vast movements. Parties had millions of members and were among the biggest voluntary associations in the country. When addressing the party faithful, a leader was addressing a real group, a significant group.</p> <p>But now? The mass party movements are no more. The membership has disappeared. And yet everyone keeps going as if it hasn\u2019t happened.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finkelstein suggests that annual conferences should be abandoned. Much as I like coming, I think he's onto something.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am not assailing party members. It is fashionable to say they are swivel-eyed or doddery. Me, I\u2019ve always liked them. There\u2019s no part of their strange political obsession that I don\u2019t partake of fully myself. I\u2019ve had a lot to do with Tory party members and overwhelmingly found them kind, intelligent, engaged and committed to their communities. Other party memberships are no less so.</p> <p>But their politics are hardly representative. Not even of the core vote, let alone of swing voters. The biggest move in politics is from the committed to the uncommitted, from those with tribal attachments to those simply keeping score, choosing governments as if they were company managers. And the annual party conference season denies this trend, instead gathering together these unrepresentative people, encouraging them to confirm each other in their own beliefs and exerting pressure on governments and political leaderships to respond.</p> <p>The decline of mass political parties is hugely significant and almost certainly irreversible. And it\u2019s time for reform that reflects this reality. It is wrong, for instance, that what amount to little cliques should be choosing candidates for Parliament. But why not start by ending these annual conferences? A broader convention of supporters every three or four years, perhaps. That should be plenty.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5062b2d758f9bdd2eeba0249\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-26T07:46:31.526Z\">8.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There has not been much evidence of plotting against Nick Clegg at the Lib Dem conference, but my colleague <strong>Patrick Kingsley</strong> was at the Liberal Left fringe meeting yesterday where he discovered that an attempted coup is underway. It's being masterminded by Lembit Opik! Here's what Patrick sent me.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Half of Liberal Democrats are dissatisfied with Nick Clegg, according to an activists' poll, but it's been hard to find barefaced dissent at conference. Last night's Liberal&#xa0;Left event was the exception \u2013 former MP Lembit Opik openly demanded that Clegg resign as leader, soliciting support for a petition that calls for Clegg to remain as&#xa0;deputy prime minister, but step away from the running of the party.</p> <p>\"The problem is that the image of the Liberal Democrats is mixed up with the coalition government,\" said Opik. Clegg is too tainted by his relationship with the Tories, he&#xa0;said: if he's not ousted by the next election, \"we'll be throttled to death.\"</p> <p>Currently, the Lib Dem conference cannot fire the Lib Dem leader. But should Opik's petition gather enough support, it would force a vote at the party's spring&#xa0;conference on whether to give delegates the power to sack Clegg. The proposal would need a two-thirds majority to pass.</p> <p>Opik wants Clegg to get on with the business of running the country, and let someone else try to remould the party's image. That someone, he argued, would ideally be&#xa0;a leftish backbencher who comes from the grass-roots. He wouldn't name names \u2013 but party president Tim Farron fits the bill.&#xa0;</p> <p>Opik was speaking at a fringe event hosted by Liberal Left, the party's most left-wing faction \u2013 and led by rebel MP Adrian Sanders, assembly member Stephen Knight,&#xa0;and Liberal Left chair Linda Jack.</p> <p>\"Where next for the Liberal Democrats?\" the panellists asked \u2013 and for many the answer was clear: away from Clegg.</p> <p>\"When your party leader starts to appear on your opponents' leaflets more often than your own,\" said Knight, \"you have to wonder whether or not he's an asset.\"&#xa0;</p> <p>More generally, there were concerns that the Lib Dems have swung too far to the right in recent years. \"There is a feeling that this is no longer our party,\" said Linda&#xa0;Jack, who tabled an amendment on Monday criticising the coalition's deficit plans, which was shot down by party honchos. A decade ago, she argued, social liberals&#xa0;like her were at the centre of the Liberal Democrats. But because so many left-wingers have since left, those who remain are now seen as extremists.</p> <p>Knight was particularly upset at a recent pamphlet on \"Cleggism\" written by Richard Reeves, Clegg's outgoing strategist. Reeves promoted the pamphlet at a think-tank&#xa0;event on Monday \u2013 arguing that the party should abandon their social democratic wing, and redefine themselves as purely big-L Liberal. Sanders said Reeves shouldn't&#xa0;be taken too seriously: his debate was mocked at a meeting of the parliamentary party on Monday. One MP, he said, noted that it was on at the same time as a&#xa0;discussion about assisted dying \u2013 and wondered whether the two events could have been merged.</p> <p>For his part, Sanders stayed clear of saying anything particularly inflammatory. But he suggested that Clegg was stuck in a bubble, and needed to employ more advisers&#xa0;with links to the grassroots.</p> <p>So if this was the revolution, it was a pretty small one. Only 20 people turned up, evidence that not everyone left in the party hankers after rebellion. Sanders said there&#xa0;were no machinations within parliament to depose Clegg, while Opik is a marginal figure, ridiculed for losing one of the Liberal Democrats' safest seats in 2010.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-27T10:03:21.626Z\">at 11.03am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5062b11dc0e327c3f7c905bd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-26T07:39:19.760Z\">8.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It's the final day of the Lib Dem conference and Nick Clegg will close the conference with a speech at 2.30pm.

Break our deal with the Conservatives, give up on the Coalition, and present ourselves to the electorate in 2015 as a party unchanged. It\u2019s an alluring prospect in some ways. Gone would be the difficult choices, the hard decisions, the necessary compromises. And gone too would be the vitriol and abuse, from Right and Left, as we work every day to keep this Government anchored in the centre ground.</p> <p>But conference, I tell you this. The choice between the party we were, and the party we are becoming, is a false one. The past is gone and it isn\u2019t coming back. If voters want a party of opposition \u2013 a \u201cstop the world I want to get off\u201d party \u2013 they\u2019ve got plenty of options, but we are not one of them. There\u2019s a better, more meaningful future waiting for us. Not as the third party, but as one of three parties of government.</p> </blockquote> <p>Before Clegg speaks, we've also got a full programme of events this morning.

He accused the British government of violating Assange's human rights, saying he could be stuck in the embassy in London for 10 years, which would have a severe impact on his health.</p> <p>Assange, dressed in a shirt and half-knotted tie, appeared tired and unwell on the video. He had dark rings under his eyes and sniffed frequently during a prepared presentation. Assange focused largely on Barack's Obama address to the UN on Tuesday in which the president gave a staunch defence of freedom of speech, and voiced American support for the revolutions in the Arab world.</p> <p>Assange said that it was \"audacious\" for the US government \"to take credit for the last two years of progress\", given past American support for the ousted Arab dictators. He said <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/20/tunisian-fruit-seller-mohammed-bouazizi\">Mohammed Bouazizi, a Tunisian street pedlar</a> whose suicide from despair over his life in January last year sparked the revolt, \"did not set himself on fire so that Barack Obama could get re-elected\".</p> <p>He added that it was \"disrespect to the dead to claim that the United States supported the forces of change\".</p> <p>Instead, Assange claimed that it was the leak of classified US diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks, allegedly by a US soldier in military intelligence, Bradley Manning, that \"went on to help trigger the Arab spring\".</p> <p>Referring to Obama's UN defence of the freedom of expression, Assange pointed to the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jul/29/bradley-manning-torturous-holding-conditions\">treatment of Manning in US prison</a>, where he was held in isolation, stripped and left naked for hours in his cell, and to the denunciation of WikiLeaks by American leaders.</p> <p>\"The time for words has run out. It is time to cease the persecution of our people and our alleged sources. It is time to join the force of change, not in fine words but in fine deeds,\" Assange said.</p> <p>Assange and the Ecuadorean government argue that if he goes to Sweden to face the sexual assault allegations against him, he could be extradited from there to the US to face politically-motivated prosecution. The Sydney Morning Herald <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/political-news/us-calls-assange-enemy-of-state-20120927-26m7s.html\">has published what it described as declassified US air force counter-intelligence reports</a> which designated Assange and WikiLeaks as \"enemies of the United States\", the same legal category as al-Qaida and the Taliban.</p> <p>The British government said it is legally obliged to carry out Assange's extradition after the Australian's appeals in the British courts were rejected. It has also said that according to European law, it would not allow extradition to the United States on charges that could result in the death penalty. Pati\u00f1o argued that the UK's human rights obligations overrode its duty under EU treaty.</p> <p>\"The United Kingdom says it defends human rights,\" Pati\u00f1o said. \"Would it be human to try to keep Mr Assange in the embassy for months or years?\" He added that Assange might spend up to 10 years in the embassy \"without right to his life or his privacy\".</p>",

That is bad, I have ended my career on your show tonight,\" the prime minister said, after struggling when Letterman fired a series of questions at him.</p> <p>Shifting slightly awkwardly in his seat, Cameron first ran into trouble when Letterman asked him who composed the music for Rule Britannia after the band struck up the music from the Last Night of the Proms. \"Elgar,\" he said uneasily. \"You are testing me,\" he added.</p> <p>Letterman waited until near the end of Cameron's appearance to point out that Thomas Arne composed the music, and that the poem was by James Thomson.</p> <p>Letterman picked on Rule Britannia to remind the prime minister that Britain once had an empire on which the sun never set. Cameron showed a better grasp of American history as he rattled through Anglo-American relations. \"We had a bit of a falling out, [though] I think we are getting over that,\" the Oxford PPE graduate said. \"We interfered in your politics 200 years ago when we sailed up the river and burnt the White House.\"</p> <p>Cameron asked to become the first sitting prime minister to appear on the Letterman show, recorded at the legendary Ed Sullivan Theatre on Broadway, to fly the flag for British business. He told Letterman he was \"shamelessly\" exploiting the afterglow of the Olympics and Paralympics.</p> <p>Cameron retrieved his honour when asked to explain the difference between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. He summed up the partition of Ireland in a few seconds and went on to praise the Queen's visit to Dublin last year. He made one minor slip when he said she was the first member of her family to visit since independence. The Prince of Wales has visited on numerous occasions.</p> <p>The interrogation turned to Magna Carta. \"1215,\" he shot back when asked the date it was signed. It took him a few minutes to give the venue \u2013 Runnymede \u2013 before delivering a first class essay about its significance in checking the powers of the English crown.</p> <p>But he did not know the English for Magna Carta. Cameron's university chum, Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, who has appeared on the show, will no doubt be chuckling. Letterman eventually ended Cameron's agony, explaining it meant Great Charter.</p> <p>Letterman's producers gave the show a southern English middle class theme, providing the US audience with a guide to the British class system. The other guest was the British actor Jonny Lee Miller, who made his name in Trainspotting. Miller, the former husband of Angelina Jolie, is from Kingston, Surrey, and was educated at Tiffin, a local grammar school.</p> <p>Mumford &amp; Sons, the folk rock band from Wimbledon, offered a song from their new album Babel. Marcus Mumford, the lead singer, was educated at King's College School. As an Etonian, Cameron represented a higher step on the ladder of the English private school system.</p> <p>Cameron, who ran rings round Jeremy Paxman during the 2005 Tory leadership contest, took care to prepare for his encounter with Letterman. One joke doing the rounds was that Sir Kim Darroch, Britain's national security adviser who has a quick and dry humour, would stand in for Letterman in rehearsals.</p> <p>In the end the Cameron prep team, led by his communications director and former television news editor Craig Oliver, fired a series of questions at him. Top of the list were queries about the Queen after the Letterman team told No 10 they were fascinated by the British monarch after her walk-on part in the James Bond section of the Olympics opening ceremony.</p> <p>The Cameron team studied with care Johnson's appearance on the Letterman show in June, when the mayor was asked how long he has been cutting his hair. \"That's a low blow,\" New York-born Johnson replied with a smile.</p> <p>Barack Obama was given a reasonably easy ride on the show this month when he appeared after the leaked video in which the Republican presidential challenger, Mitt Romney, appeared to write off 47% of the US electorate. The prime minister watched a recording of Obama's appearance as part of his preparation.</p> <p>One senior British source said: \"It is just a good opportunity. Britain has had an extraordinary year with the Jubilee, with the Olympics and with the Paralympics. We have got something good to shout about. So getting out there talking up Britain is important.</p> <p>\"We should never forget that we are the biggest investor in America, America is the biggest investor in us. There is a saying in business that when you want to do better you go back to your biggest customers and try and squeeze out a bit more.\"</p> <p>Cameron sought to show a modern Britain. Letterman did his best to counter that in laying the ground for Cameron's appearance by releasing dry ice to depict \"London fog\".</p>"
