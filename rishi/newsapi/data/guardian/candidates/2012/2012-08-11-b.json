[
  "<p>The annual general meeting of the <a href=\"http://www.rspb.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Royal Society for the Protection of Birds </a>is a splendid affair, held in the heart of London. Around 1,000 enthusiastic members attend and its high point is a rousing recital of the year's achievements from the charity's chairman. The tone tends towards the evangelical. At last year's gathering, the RSPB's current chairman, Ian Darling, was able to applaud a record membership of more than 1 million, each paying \u00a33 a&#xa0;month to help preserve Britain's bird life \u2013 or, as the handout puts it, anything that \"hops, crawls or flutters in your garden\".</p> <p>This is the charity that draws in the devoted, tending their bird tables across the country, and proud parents sending their children out on ornithological field trips. But it's also one of the nation's leading conservation bodies. Mr Darling recounted some of the success stories: the Great Crane Project which has restored the common crane to the Somerset Levels after an absence of 400 years; red-backed shrikes breeding successfully for the first time in the UK in 17 years; and red kites hatching in Northern Ireland after 200 years.</p> <p>He could applaud the healthy state of the society's finances \u2013 a net income of \u00a394m, and expenditure of \u00a383m. Its funds, boosted by generous legacies from members, are largely spent on conservation projects, including buying up land as nature reserves; it owned 209 at the last count, covering roughly 300,000 acres of Britain, almost half of this in Scotland, making it that country's eighth-largest landowner.</p> <p>With all this financial muscle comes considerable influence. The advice of the RSPB is sought by governments and major companies on a&#xa0;range of issues, from the siting of wind farms to the planning of ring roads and airport runways. Not only sought, but adhered to. The big power companies, key players in onshore and offshore energy, pay tribute to the RSPB for steering them away from sites that are judged damaging to bird life. They know that to ignore the advice is to incur the risk of long-drawn-out planning objections and ultimate defeat.</p> <p>In most cases, such RSPB publicity is immensely successful \u2013 and why not? Surely this is one of Britain's most popular charities, source of an immense body of scientifically objective knowledge about wildlife, not just in Britain but across the world. Yet the RSPB has incurred the hostility of farmers, landowners and even the rural communities among whom it works. An organisation that once prided itself on its close links with countryside affairs and its working knowledge of the land now finds itself at a&#xa0;distance, assisting the police in exposing landowners whom it accuses of wildlife crime, and heaping blame on farmers for agricultural practices which it says have led to a dramatic fall in the numbers of once-common species. Though its stance on shooting is officially \"neutral\", a remarkably high proportion of its press releases concern owners of grouse moors and pheasant shoots, blaming them for trapping, poisoning and shooting birds of prey, or \"raptors\" as they are defined. A recent campaign urged its youngest members to help the society by turning detective: \"Can you help stop the criminals?\" it asks. \"With your help we can save birds of prey.\"</p> <p>Since the upper moorland of Britain is one of the most fragile eco-systems in the country, and agriculture accounts for more than 75% of its land, this is the frontline of conservation.</p> <p>Landowners and farmers claim that there is something odd about the RSPB's very public campaigns and about how they appear to be obsessed by birds of prey above all others. These are, of course, Britain's most glamorous birds. But the suggestion that they are under threat appears, to some, to be a highly partial version of the truth.</p> <p>The picture painted by the latest Breeding Birds Survey, compiled by the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), a science-based organisation, challenges the RSPB assertion head on. Species such as kites, eagles, goshawks, and peregrine are all doing well, with kites in particular, now re-introduced to Britain, a familiar sight over large areas of southern England, Wales and the Scottish Highlands. Golden eagles are flourishing enough for around 40 of them to have been \"relocated\" to County Donegal in Ireland. Buzzards, another common bird of prey, have multiplied by more than 600% since 1967, prompting Defra, the government's environment department, to consider ways of controlling them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394812543\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2012/8/6/1344271215129/Hen-harrier-001.jpg\" alt=\"Hen harrier\" width=\"460\" height=\"275\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A hen harrier with chicks in Sutherland. Photograph: Mark Hamblin/Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Hamblin/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even the number of hen harriers, which remain on the BTO's \"red list\" of globally threatened species under threat, increased from 570 nesting pairs in Britain in 1998 to 806 in 2004, before declining to 646 in 2010. Its European population runs into many thousands.</p> <p>The RSPB, however, maintains a passionate campaign on behalf of all birds of prey, irrespective of their numbers, its publicity eclipsing its concern for smaller birds, many of which now feature on the BTO's list of genuinely endangered species \u2013 willow tits, yellow wagtails, lapwing, grey partridge, redshank, stonechat and mistle thrush, some of which have undergone a population crash. In working to conserve these, the society needs to have those who own and manage the land on their side.</p> <p>Landowners and farmers, who find themselves on the receiving end of hostile publicity, say that they are every bit as concerned about the fragility of bird populations in Britain as the RSPB. They have, they admit, a more mixed view about birds of prey, seeing them, for all their beauty, as predators which attack small birds, as well as the young pheasants, grouse and sometimes even farm animals which are their livelihood. They argue that if the RSPB spent less time criticising them and more working with them as partners, much more could be achieved in the cause of conservation. The RSPB, for its part, says that it is committed to working with landowners, farmers and other land managers: \"We are the largest UK provider of free conservation advice to the farming community.\"</p> <p>Many consider that to keep its membership high, the RSPB may not want to be seen forging any kind of relationship with the shooting fraternity. Knowing that its loyal members take a dim view of blood sports, its \"neutral\" view on the subject of shooting can on occasion veer towards outright hostility. Privately, RSPB officials will concede that farmers or landowners do much good work to propagate bird species \u2013 planting bird-friendly crops, burning heather and killing vermin in order to improve shooting prospects. In public, however, support for those who kill birds for sport is rarely if ever expressed.</p> <p>John MacTavish, 46, a gamekeeper on a&#xa0;1,500-acre farm and pheasant shoot near Oban, has worked all his life on the land, and is keenly interested in conservation. But ever since the introduction of sea eagles, a spectacular bird of prey unknown in the area for 200 years, he claims he has found himself a&#xa0;constant object of suspicion. These eagles have chosen not to nest on his ground and he believes RSPB officials are convinced he's deliberately frightening them off. They come back regularly to monitor his activities.</p> <p>\"I have absolutely nothing against sea eagles,\" says MacTavish, \"but I have an antipathy towards people who come on to my ground, without permission. I wouldn't go on to their land without asking first. Why can't they have the common decency to ask me?\"</p> <p>Like many gamekeepers, MacTavish is a&#xa0;countryman born and bred, who knows his own ground like the back of his hand. It is part of his job to spend cold nights out on the hill in the constant war against foxes, using his skills to protect his partridge and pheasants, as well as ground-nesting birds, all of which suffer from the attention of predators.</p> <p>His culture could hardly be more different from that of the RSPB, whose members are largely urban-based, and who share a natural antipathy towards farmers and shooters \u2013 the former held responsible for ruining the countryside with their pesticides and fertilisers, the latter dismissed simply as killers.</p> <p>\"They seem to be hell-bent on protecting raptors at the cost of everything else,\" says MacTavish. \"But I've now got more buzzards than bullfinches.\"</p> <p>Privately, some of the society's officers agree with this, arguing that the time has come to call a truce. But its public statements on the issue continue to be aggressive. The RSPB's investigations officer is quoted on its website as stating: \"It is important to remain focused in order to bring the killers to justice. There can be no better job satisfaction than that.\"</p> <p>The society admits that it helps police carry out raids on suspect estates. \"The RSPB will provide expert assistance to enforcement agencies to assist them in their efforts to tackle wildlife crime as required,\" is the official line.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394812544\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2012/8/6/1344271154720/Grouse-shooting-001.jpg\" alt=\"Grouse shooting\" width=\"460\" height=\"275\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A shooting party on the Blair Atholl estate.  Photograph: Murdo MacLeod</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Stuart Housden, who heads the RSPB in Scotland, explains: \"The reason we focus on illegal killing of hen harriers on driven grouse moors is simply that it is by far the most important population impact in England and Scotland.\" An RSPB spokesman added that 70% of people convicted of offences relating to bird of prey persecution since 1990 were employed as gamekeepers. \"This does not mean that the majority of gamekeepers kill birds of prey,\" said a spokesman, \"but it does mean that the majority of people who are convicted of persecuting birds of prey are gamekeepers.\"</p> <p>However, farmers and landowners argue that in its determination to demonise them, the RSPB does little to highlight another side of an important conservation equation: the proven benefits that managed moorland and farmland bring to a whole range of endangered species. There have been several recent reports about the increase in populations of smaller songbirds, either on grouse moors or low ground managed for shooting, where gamekeepers and farmers are assiduous in controlling predators such as foxes and crows. These are rarely, if ever, mentioned by the RSPB.</p> <p>It is six years now since a remarkable report by one of the acknowledged experts on the bird life of moorland Britain, Dr Stephen Tapper, revealed that a&#xa0;wide range of species, including many at risk, such as plover, curlew and lapwing, but also at least one bird of prey, the merlin, had been thriving on moorland in Britain where gamekeepers had been at work. Curlew, he found, were 18 times more abundant in the North Pennines where grouse shooting took place, than in the Berwyn Special Protection Area, which, ironically, is a bird reserve; the merlin was twice as common on grouse moors as elsewhere.</p> <p>The report was virtually ignored by the RSPB. As was the more recent nine-year project carried out on the North Yorkshire moors by the Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust. Using traditional methods of predator control, the trust was able to show dramatic improvements among wading birds. In the course of the experiment, their populations improved threefold.</p> <p>This was dismissed by the RSPB's former conservation director, Mark Avery, as \"work\u2026 funded by grouse-moor managers who are keen to promote the wider value of grouse-moor management\u2026 predator control, legal and too often illegal, is part of the business of delivering lots of grouse to the shooting parties in the autumn.\"</p> <p>For a measured response to a&#xa0;serious scientific paper this borders on the facile, but highlights the yawning gulf between the two sides. And it infuriates conservationists such as Lord Peel, a former member of English Nature, and past president of the Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust. \"It seems wholly logical and desirable that there be greater co-operation between wildlife charities and the keepered estates,\" he says. \"The prospect of witnessing the virtual demise of iconic species, as has happened outside the keepered areas, along with the substantial economic benefits that accrue to hard-pressed rural areas from grouse shooting, does not bear thinking about.\"</p> <p>The RSPB's arguments might be listened to with more respect in the countryside if its own moorland estates showed better results. On two stretches of important moorland, Lake Vyrnwy in Wales and Geltsdale in Cumberland, the society has acquired what used to be grouse moors, and turned them over to conservation. Here, one might have thought, it should be able to demonstrate triumphantly that birds of prey and the birds they prey on can happily co-exist.</p> <p>In fact, results from these two moors are disappointing. Curlew, plover and other waders have all been in decline. A bar chart compiled by Natural England showing the statistics from 17 Sites of Special Interest in the North Pennines has Geltsdale hovering at the bottom, while managed grouse moors support healthy populations of wading birds. Lake Vyrnwy has around six pairs of hen harriers, but, in 10 years, has recorded no increase in numbers of curlew, lapwing or golden plover. The RSPB vigorously defends its record, claiming that black grouse<strong> </strong>at Geltsdale have shown a marked improvement, from six males in 1996 to 45 in 2011.</p> <p>What is at the heart of the argument is the impact raptors have on other species when they get the upper hand. Uncontrolled numbers rapidly lead to a decline in prey birds, as shown by a famous trial, the Joint Raptor Study [JRS], undertaken on Langholm Moor in the 1990s, which recorded what happens when grouse and raptors are allowed to co-exist without interference. Over five years, the hen harrier population exploded \u2013 from two breeding pairs to 21. The grouse were all but eliminated. As were most of the other birds, because without grouse there was no income, without income there were no gamekeepers, and without the keepers the populations of crows and foxes, which prey on young birds, shot up.</p> <p>The society initially played down the evidence, but has more recently accepted that there could be a link, and is currently involved with a project which feeds dead rats and other animals to harriers as an alternative to grouse.</p> <p>It remains adamant, however, that species such as the recently introduced sea eagle pose no serious threat to farm or domestic animals. In the teeth of evidence from farmers in the West Highlands and Fife, who have seen these huge birds take young lambs, they claim that such incidents are rare. Yet it is becoming a&#xa0;serious and growing problem for crofters. One of them, on the island of Skye, says he now keeps \"an almost sacrificial stock of sheep\" out on the hill to prevent the sea eagles coming lower down. Another says the sea eagles have even tried to take hoggs (young sheep), and have left them wounded.</p> <p>Last year, a petition signed by 100 crofters was sent to the Scottish Environment Secretary highlighting the damage caused by the sea eagles. But the RSPB dismissed the claims, saying that \"independent studies have found the majority of lamb deaths are a result of other causes apart from rare sea eagle predation incidents.\"</p> <p>More recently, when Defra, the government department that deals with rural affairs, sought to tackle the population explosion among buzzards which was causing severe problems on pheasant shoots in England, and suggested that some nests might be relocated, the RSPB sprang into action. Instead of talking to farmers and landowners about how the problem might be managed, it branded any interference as \"appalling\" and immediately issued research of its own saying that buzzards pose little harm to young pheasants.</p> <p>Similarly, when it came to examining the possible impact of sparrowhawks on sparrows \u2013 a once familiar British bird, now in serious decline \u2013 it quoted approvingly the work of Dr Stuart Newson, an acknowledged expert, who concluded that the evidence against the hawks was unproven; but it went on to dismiss the findings of Dr Christopher Bell, who, based on observations going back 30 years, reached a&#xa0;very different conclusion. He blamed sparrowhawks for as much as 65% of the decline since 1977. Despite Dr Bell's international reputation, the RSPB dismissed his findings as unreliable, saying that \"alternative explanations remain equally or more plausible\".</p> <p>Conservationists who have to work with the RSPB find this apparent bias unacceptable. \"You just know they won't take seriously anything that runs counter to their philosophy,\" says one. \"The net result is that we don't take them seriously either.\" Because the RSPB appears reluctant to acknowledge that there may be another side to a complex conservation issue, its reputation as an even-handed, science-based organisation has suffered.</p> <p>There is no doubt that some landowners and gamekeepers are responsible for breaking the law and shooting or poisoning birds of prey. The fact that the north of England teams with grouse, but has no hen harriers on ground where they should be thriving is a black mark against those who own many thousands of acres of moorland in Yorkshire, Lancashire and Northumberland. The same is true of some \"rogue\" estates in Scotland.</p> <p>But this standoff between both sides is helping neither. Many landowners neither trust nor respect the RSPB, believing it to have become a&#xa0;lobbyist for raptors rather than a truly conservationist body. For its part, the RSPB simply believes that landowners are routinely breaking the law. \"The day they stop killing birds of prey and breaking the law, we will begin talking to them,\" says Housden.</p> <p>One of those who believe this mutual hostility damages the cause of conservation is Philip Merricks, a Kent farmer and lifelong conservationist who has also created two nature reserves \u2013 one on the Isle of Sheppey, one on Romney Marsh. He concludes: \"We're at a&#xa0;grim crossroads in the history of nature conservation and it is vital that good sense and co-operation prevail. The recent slanging match between some landowners and the RSPB does nothing to improve effective co-operation, and meanwhile many birds continue to drift towards disappearance.</p> <p>\"Both sides appear to have made the mistake of thinking their work and reputation is more important than successful nature conservation. We need carefully planned research, good science and a commitment to the birds, rather than a&#xa0;moral victory over the 'other side'. No one will thank conservationists of any hue for arguing and striking postures when they could be doing some good in the fields and marshes and moors. Shooting has a key part to play in conservation; sniping does not. Conservation has a key part to play, indiscriminate condemnation does not.\"</p> <p>Sniping and condemning, however, seems to be how the RSPB conducts its campaigns. As a result, it has lost trust in an area where trust is essential. A picture appears to have emerged of a charitable organisation drifting away from its principal purpose \u2013 to propagate all species of birds, rather than a chosen few; instead of acting as a model of evidence-based science, it seems to have turned increasingly into a lobbying body, more intent on boosting its membership than in propagating objective research.</p> <p>In the long battle for conservation, the RSPB proclaims as its slogan \"a million voices for nature\". But in doing so, it is pitting itself against a million more who believe that its policies may be damaging the very nature it purports to defend.</p> <p>\u2022 The standfirst to this article was amended on 16 August 2012 to clarify the author's position as a trustee of a Highland estate.</p>",
  "<p>The announcement by Mitt Romney of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/11/romney-vice-president-paul-ryan?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Paul Ryan </a>as his running mate is both controversial and surprising. US pundits had been predicting a more widely appealing figure in the shape of <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/r/marco_rubio/index.html\" title=\"\">Marco Rubio</a> or <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/chris-christie/\" title=\"\">Chris Christie</a>, both of whom, recent polls have suggested, would make Romney a stronger candidate. Instead, Republicans have the 42-year-old chairman of the <a href=\"http://budget.house.gov/\" title=\"\">House Budget Committee</a>, who has credited the beginning of his interest in the \"economics thing\" with the novels of <a href=\"http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=index\" title=\"\">Ayn Rand</a>.</p> <p>If Ryan has been unusual among many Republicans in this campaign cycle it is because he has been prepared, in his role on the Budget Committee, to provide a detailed budget for growth and deficit reduction that he claims will avoid \"European\"-style austerity.</p> <p>Part of a new generation of Republicans determined to rid their party of a reputation for profligacy, it is precisely the detail Ryan has supplied that makes him such a risky pick. Although Ryan's headline, on paper at least,seems to echo Obama \u2013 growth over austerity \u2013 those who have crunched his numbers and policies doubt whether his proposals are any different from what economist <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html\" title=\"\">Paul Krugman</a> has called the \"confidence fairy\", the notion that the economy can be spurred into growth by relentless cutting.</p> <p>Indeed, according to some analysts, including the <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/\" title=\"\">Economic Policy Institute</a>, far from reducing the deficit, his proposals might actually add to US debt and risk the net loss of 4.1 million jobs over two years. Most controversial of all, and an easy target for Democrats, is his plan to scrap Medicare and replace it with a voucher system.</p> <p>Which leaves Americans with a stark choice on the economy: between Obama's proposal for gradual deficit reduction tied to policies for modest growth against Ryan's desire to slash \u00a36tn from government spending. Seen from the UK, where a rigid cuts programme has delivered zero growth, Ryan will have a lot of work to do to explain why his plan won't deliver precisely the same result.</p>",
  "<p>The defining characteristic of modern American politics is the growing conservatism, even radicalisation, of the Republican party. Beginning in 2009 with the birth of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/tea-party-movement\" title=\"\">Tea Party movement</a>, a party that was already fairly conservative began moving to an even more isolated spot on the American political spectrum. The result was, and is, an unprecedented period of legislative obstructionism, pronounced political polarisation and a party that is more ideologically conservative than perhaps at any point in history.</p> <p>It's a process unlikely to be reversed in the near future. The party's rightward tilt is going to get worse before it gets better and the polarisation of American politics and the extremism of the Republican party looks increasingly like the rule, rather than the exception.</p> <p>To explain why, move past the presidential election for a moment. Start in Texas where, in a Republican primary, Tea Party darling <a href=\"http://lubbockonline.com/editorial-columnists/2012-08-11/hightower-texas-cruz-control-illustrates-just-how-goofy-politics-has#.UCY3979y9E4\" title=\"\">Ted Cruz </a>defeated the state's Republican lieutenant governor, David Dewhurst. Cruz's victory was not necessarily the result of him being more conservative than his opponent. In fact, one would be hard pressed to find many policy differences between them. But Dewhurst was seen as a fixture of the Republican establishment while Cruz was viewed as a member of the party's insurgent, anti-establishment wing, vehemently opposed to any compromise of core values.</p> <p>Next we go to Kansas, where in Tuesday's Republican primaries for the state Senate, conservative candidates, pushed by the state's Republican governor, Sam Brownback, and backed by dollars from the infamous <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/08/11/billionaire-koch-brothers-fail-in-hitting-comedian-zach-galifianakis.html\" title=\"\">Koch brothers,</a> trounced all but one of the body's remaining moderate Republicans. Then Missouri, where congressman <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/08/todd-akin-republican-missouri-senate?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Todd Akin,</a> another conservative darling, won a Republican Senate primary versus two more moderate contenders. Now a grain of salt is necessary here. In several of these races, Republican \"establishment\" candidates were beaten for reasons other than just ideology. None the less, it's simply impossible to ignore the unmistakable signs of ideological transformation in the party. Outside money, from anti-tax and anti-government zealots such as the Koch brothers' <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/02/koch-brothers-obama-campaign-americans-for-prosperity-donors_n_1316537.html\" title=\"\">Americans for Prosperity</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.teapartyexpress.org/\" title=\"\">Tea Party Express</a> and <a href=\"http://www.clubforgrowth.org/\" title=\"\">Club for Growth</a> as well as from social conservative groups such as Ralph Reed's <a href=\"http://ffcoalition.com/\" title=\"\">Faith and Freedom Coalition</a>, was a decisive factor \u2013 and not simply in advertising dollars, but also in improving conservative turnout. So too was the support of Tea Party favourites such as former Alaska governor and 2008 vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin and South Carolina senator Jim DeMint.</p> <p>The larger message from these political events is hard to ignore. If you are a Republican officeholder, what is the incentive to risk crossing the Tea Party or the Koch brothers? Is there any reason to consider political compromise or conciliation with Democrats, knowing that to do so means tempting a Tea Party challenge and millions of dollars in out-of-state cash being used to end your political career? The smart move for Republicans, indeed the only move, is to stay on the \"right\" side of the political fence. While this lesson has been hammered into the heads of Republican politicians over the last two election cycles, it is also evident on the presidential level. When Mitt Romney first ran for elected office in Massachusetts in 1994, he cast himself as a relatively centrist, technocratic businessman. He took more moderate positions on divisive social issues such as abortion and in a year in which Republicans had the political momentum at their back assiduously avoided being linked to Newt Gingrich and the national party.</p> <p>When he ran for governor of Massachusetts in 2002, he strayed only marginally from those positions, continuing to stress his pro-choice bona fides and even adopted a position on gun control that ran counter to the powerful National Rifle Association. As late as 2008, when he first ran for president, Romney was prone to tout his one major domestic policy initiative \u2013 healthcare reform.</p> <p>Those were the days. As the Republicans have moved consistently further to the right Romney has followed the crowd, adopting increasingly strident political positions. This was true throughout the Republican primary season as Romney, facing off against a motley collection of Tea Party-approved also-rans, was forced to take stances on immigration, government spending, taxes, abortion and a host of other issues favoured by the party's most conservative members but that left him vulnerable to Democratic counterattack.</p> <p>Illegal immigration is perhaps the best example. It's an issue that is a veritable cri de coeur for the Tea Party and Romney embraced their views to the point where he attacked unpopular Texan governor Rick Perry for insufficient rigour in cutting social services for illegal immigrants in the state. It gave Romney a boost in the Republican primaries but also provides a hint as to why he is losing Hispanic voters to Obama by a 2-1 margin.</p> <p>But the romancing of the Tea Party continues. Just last week, the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/guest-voices/post/obamas-war-on-religion-breaking-down-romneys-new-attack-ad/2012/08/10/9f9ece3e-e2fd-11e1-a25e-15067bb31849_blog.html\" title=\"\">Romney campaign </a>ran two controversial ads, one attacking Obama on welfare benefits, the other accusing the president of declaring a war on religion, because of his backing of a provision of the healthcare law that forces businesses to provides contraceptive services to their employees. Both ads are basically made-up attacks; lies for lack of a better word. But the mendacity of the Romney campaign is by now well chronicled.</p> <p>What's more interesting is the target for them: conservative voters who recoil at the thought of welfare cheats absconding with their taxpayer dollars and religious voters convinced by years of Republican rhetoric that their faith is under assault. Just as Republicans in the Senate have reason to be fearful of the wrath of the Tea Party, so does Romney. Just three weeks before his convention, he is in the uncomfortable position of reassuring the right about his conservative bona fides.</p> <p>With confirmation that Romney has selected a conservative favourite, Wisconsin congressman <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/romney-to-announce-running-mate-saturday-in-va/2012/08/10/aaeb8ce4-e363-11e1-89f7-76e23a982d06_story.html\" title=\"\">Paul Ryan,</a> to be his running mate the capturing of Romney by the far right is complete. While Ryan is popular on the right, he is the author of the so-called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/11/romney-vice-president-paul-ryan?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Ryan budget</a>, a House of Representatives-passed bill that would eviscerate the social safety net and end the federal senior health programme, Medicare. His selection allows the Obama campaign to attack Romney even more directly over the most unpopular elements of the Ryan budget (which the candidate has already foolishly endorsed). It is a disastrous pick, but is emblematic of the extent to which Romney's hands have been tied by the Tea Party. Pacifying them is as important as reaching out to less conservative voters. Rather than leading the GOP, Romney is simply following the herd.</p> <p>But why should he be any different from the rest of the Republican party? In just four short years, any ideological variance has been washed almost completely out of the party. Republican moderates are something one reads about in history books rather than sees with one's own eyes.</p> <p>The Tea Party has become the Republican party. And if Romney should win in November his moderate political instincts (if they haven't been completely eroded by years of pandering to the right) will be no match for the sound and fury of Congressional Republicans who will demand fealty to their agenda. If that happens, Americans can say goodbye to large chunks of the social welfare state they often deride in the abstract but love in its specifics, such as Medicare, federal education funding, environmental and workplace regulation.</p> <p>If Romney loses in November, which increasingly appears likely, don't expect soul-searching within the Republican party. Instead, conservatives will likely convince themselves their mistake was failing to nominate a true rightwinger rather than Romney's brand of wannabe conservatism. As for Congress, the primary wins for Cruz, Akin, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/09/indiana-us-elections-2012\" title=\"\">Richard Mourdock </a>\u2013 even if they lose in November \u2013 will mean that a body full of Republican politicians will toe the new party line. There will be zero political incentive to compromise with Obama and risk a challenge from the right. Ongoing challenges from a crumbling infrastructure \u2013 under-performing schools, growing environmental challenges and, above all, chronically high unemployment and an inadequate economic recovery \u2013 will likely see precious little attention from Washington.</p> <p>In short, the polarisation and dysfunction that have wrecked American politics over the past three and a half years will almost certainly continue. Through a combination of fear and intimidation, the far right of the Republican Party is today enforcing ideological rigidness in its purest and most uncompromising form, where even the slightest variation from the norm is reason for expulsion and exclusion. In the process, it is holding the US government hostage to its ideological whims. Welcome to the new normal in American politics.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/11/paul-ryan-mitt-romney-vp-live\">Mitt Romney introducing Paul Ryan</a> as the country's \"next president\" was not the funniest, or the most ironic, or even the most meaningful moment of this morning's announcement. It was just the most obvious mistake.</p> <p>Aside from putting Ryan on the ticket to begin with.</p> <p>For those scoring in the other categories: the most hilarious soundbite was probably Romney riffing awkwardly (Romney doesn't riff any other way) that Ryan doesn't curse the darkness, \"he'd rather light candles\" \u2013 a quasi-romantic sentiment that ran up against Ryan's off-kilter attractiveness to lead straight to the creation of @PaulRyanGosling. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/PaulRyanGosling/statuses/234266623949799424\">Sample Tweet</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Hey girl, let's grow the pie together.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Most ironic? How about transvaginal probe enthusiast Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell extolling the virtues of small government? I mean, I guess if you need it to fit in those hard-to-reach-places \u2026</p> <p>As for meaningfulness, there is a lacuna where military service used to be on a presidential ticket's resume. It's the first time in 80 years that no candidate on either side is a veteran \u2013 this despite being in the midst of a war that will literally have no end. (And veterans of this war facing unprecedented levels of <a href=\"http://iava.org/blog/jobless-rate-jumps-to-15.2-for-Iraq-and-Afghanistan-era-veterans\">unemployment</a>, along with equally unprecedented and complex health issues \u2013 most alarmingly, a 27-year-high <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/09/us/suicides-eclipse-war-deaths-for-us-troops.html/\">suicide</a> rate.)</p> <p>But there's a bright side! As a nerdy midwesterner myself, I'm proud to see someone as unashamedly wonky and deeply Wisconsin-y as Ryan on stage. We've had nerds in the White House before \u2013 exhibit A: <a href=\"http://www.suntimes.com/photos/galleries/index.html?story=12157445\">Obama's mom jeans</a> and BlackBerry \u2013 but Ryan would be the first to make sure childhood playground injuries count as pre-existing conditions. Sigh \u2026 Ryan is so tightly yoked to a vision of government parsimony that it's almost too easy to joke about the threat his policies pose to the poor and the elderly.</p> <p>Indeed, the right mobilized quickly to portray attacks on Ryan's proposed budget as weaknesses in and of itself. As the announcement was made, GOP consultant Rick Wilson tweeted:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Don't let them fool you: the granny-over-the-cliff attacks are a sign of their fear, weakness and fecklessness.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Of course, those attacks are also a sign of concern for granny. Ryan's Medicare-slashing is already part of the liberal shorthand argument. Less remarked upon is that his budget would actually hurt the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/ryans-budget-its-not-about-medicare-cuts/2011/08/25/gIQAmZNtRS_blog.html\">poor</a> \u2013 in cuts to Medicaid \u2013 even more.</p> <p>Fox pre-emptively exploded some metaphors in their excitement over the pick, with anchor Bret Baier waxing philosophical with this query about Ryan's plan:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Is America ready for this level of candor? Is not touching the third rail the new third rail?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Pro tip: when people who support a candidate credit him for candor, it's because what he's saying is really unpopular. (When people on the other side of the aisle give a politician credit for candor, it's because they agree.)</p> <p>Ryan has positives, of course \u2013 but beside his dimples, almost all of them endear him only to the Republican base. His selection should concern those very voters: wouldn't better proof of Romney's conservative credentials be, you know, governing more conservatively in the past? Lack of confidence in Romney's conservatism runs both ways: picking Ryan also suggests that the Romney team has doubts about turning out the base in the fall. This despite poll after poll showing that GOP enthusiasm to outpace Democrats'.</p> <p>Independent voters will have every right to be confused: does Ryan's place on the ticket mean that Romney has embraced ripping up the American social contract; or does it mean he just wants it to look that way?</p> <p>Conservatives who genuinely support Ryan get bad news, as well. Daily Beast columnist Eli Lake emailed colleagues:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The worst that can happen to Paul Ryan is that the ticket wins. Then Ryan \u2013 who has won a loyal following as the principled budget cutter \u2013 will have to line up behind Romney budgets [which are as mysterious as Ryan's are concrete]. This is kind of like putting Eddie Van Halen in REO Speedwagon. Yes, it makes REO Speedwagon rock a lot harder, but it totally ruins Van Halen.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>But hey, nice battleship! (Media savant Jeff Jarvis <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeffjarvis/status/234278006875631617\">quipped</a> that all the announcement \"need[ed] is a flight suit and a Mission Accomplished banner.\")</p> <p>Ryan is at least something new to talk about in a race whose broad outlines have been clear for almost three years. And Ryan has enthusiasm, youth, and the ability to refrain from saying things like \"sport\", and \"of that nature\". He probably has never made a $10,000 bet.</p> <p>Look at the crowds at Romney-Ryan rallies over the next few days, before the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=US&amp;hl=en&amp;client=mv-google&amp;v=oWyk-Mr6cfc&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player&amp;nomobile=1\">attacks ads</a> start sinking in: white people haven't been this happy since they found out electing Obama ended racism.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/11/paul-ryan-mitt-romney-vp-live\">Mitt Romney has selected Wisconsin congressman Paul Ryan to be his vice-presidential nominee</a>. My initial reaction is that it doesn't makes much sense electorally. But let's examine the three key arguments that Ryan's advocates have made to advance the case for his selection as VP.</p> <p><strong>1. Paul Ryan will fire up the Republican base</strong></p> <p>The biggest reason to select Paul Ryan is that he's adored by the Republican base. That was one of the main arguments for selecting Sarah Palin, and it made sense in a year when Democrats were <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/156194/democratic-voting-enthusiasm-down-sharply-2004-2008.aspx\">\"fired up and ready to go\"</a>. Now, it doesn't. It is true that Mitt Romney is not Mr Conservative, but Republicans are <a href=\"http://sas-origin.onstreammedia.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/POLL/ata1hjasg0-lg1ktei3olw.gif\">already with him</a> and ready to vote. </p> <p>\u2022 Mitt Romney hasn't led in a single NBC/WSJ poll this year, yet he's never trailed among the voters \"<a href=\"http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/07/25/12947754-first-thoughts-two-opposing-forces?lite\">most interested in the election</a>\".</p> <p>\u2022 Mitt Romney hasn't led in a single Fox News poll in the past four months, but he's never trailed among the voters \"<a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/interactive/2012/08/09/fox-news-poll-presidential-race/\">most interested</a>\" </p> <p>\u2022 Mitt Romney hasn't led in a single Pew poll this year, but Republicans lead on pretty much all the variables <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2012/06/21/gop-holds-early-turnout-edge-but-little-enthusiasm-for-romney/\">associated with higher turnout</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 Mitt Romney has trailed in most Gallup surveys, but Republicans are consistently registering as <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/154559/US-Presidential-Election-Center.aspx?ref=interactive\">more likely to vote</a>.</p> <p>Perhaps the polling is missing something; perhaps Republicans really are depressed. There are some indications they <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/06/how-deep-obama-lead-battleground-states\">may be in Ohio</a>, but these \"signs\" are mostly speculative and scattered.</p> <p>Romney's big issue is not that Republicans won't vote for him but that he's <a href=\"http://hotair.com/archives/2012/08/09/obama-now-leads-romney-by-11-among-independents-in-new-cnn-and-fox-news-polls/\">losing among independents</a> in the polls that show him down. A larger Republican turnout could also help compensate for losses among independents, but there's a point where the well is going to run dry.</p> <p><strong>2. Paul Ryan brings more to a Romney campaign running chiefly on the economy</strong></p> <p>Romney has attempted to run a campaign that allows the economy to do the talking, saying that he will use his business experience to lend it a helping hand. Some metrics <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/economy-might-be-gaining-traction-new-data-suggest/2012/08/09/23fadef8-e23a-11e1-98e7-89d659f9c106_story.html\">suggest that the economy is coming back</a>, which would favor this strategy. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrendanNyhan/status/233927838523326464\">Other data points</a> are less encouraging, but overall, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/may/01/obama-v-romney-economic-matchup\">evidence from past campaigns</a> tells us that when campaigns don't talk about the economy, they usually lose.</p> <p>While it may be true that Romney needs to talk about more than economy to win, other issues shouldn't overwhelm his campaign. I don't really see how Ryan helps keep the focus.</p> <p><strong>3. Paul Ryan can help Romney win Wisconsin</strong></p> <p>This is an argument that could make some sense in certain circumstances. Almost everyone agrees that vice-presidents can win for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/mar/26/mitt-romney-choose-vp-running-mate\">ticket support in his or her home state</a>. The issue is that Mitt Romney is behind by <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/wi/wisconsin_romney_vs_obama-1871.html\">about 5-6 points in Wisconsin</a>. Vice-presidents don't typically get you more than 2-3 points.</p> <p>Paul Ryan isn't <a href=\"http://polltracker.talkingpointsmemo.com/contests/paul-ryan-favorability-wi\">especially popular</a> in Wisconsin, so the evidence suggests he certainly won't exceed the normal vice-presidential home state effect and might come in a shade below. Two or three percentage points is not enough to put Wisconsin in Romney's column.</p> <p>There was <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2012/07/obama-has-narrow-lead-in-wisconsin.html#more\">one poll</a> that indicated Ryan might close the gap for Romney, but I read that result with great caution. Let's recall that polls showed, for instance, John Edwards helping John Kerry to \"win\" <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/Presidential_04/nc_polls.html\">North Carolina in 2004</a>.</p> <p>Beyond the relative weakness of the reasons to pick Ryan, there are also plenty of substantive reasons not to choose him.</p> <p><strong>1. Paul Ryan is basically an unknown</strong></p> <p>Ryan has spent time in the House of Representatives, and has achieved some profile as chairman of the House budget committee, but he hasn't run a competitive race in 14 years. He's never run for an election statewide.</p> <p>So yes, he's been on TV some, but who really knows what's behind the curtain? I certainly don't. Ryan would, of course, be closely vetted before being picked, but even if there are no outright skeletons in the cupboard, there are bound to be some \"hard to explain\" embarrassments. Just look at how much stuff has come out about Romney \u2013 his taxes, his record at Bain, his Swiss bank account \u2013 in the past two months, and he is a tried and tested presidential campaigner.</p> <p><strong>2. Paul Ryan's Medicare reform plan becomes a central electoral issue</strong></p> <p>With Ryan now on the GOP ticket, Democrats will seek to make the Ryan plan's proposed cuts to Medicare, aka \"Ryancare\", a focal point of their electioneering. The plan receives only <a href=\"http://www.democracycorps.com/Search/?areas%5B0%5D=jtags&amp;searchword=ryan+budget\">lukewarm support</a> when survey respondents are given Republican talking points. The plan hurts Romney when respondents are given Democratic talking points.</p> <p>Ryancare's downside seems to far outweigh Ryan's own potential upside. Can the Romney campaign really have decided that it would prefer to talk about Medicare, instead of Romney's record at Bain Capital? But the scrutiny of Ryancare will be yet another distraction from talking about the economy, which is an argument far easier won amid <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20120808-710491.html\">flagging consumer confidence</a>.</p> <p><strong>3. There are other candidates who could have done more for Romney</strong></p> <p>If Mitt Romney had wanted someone who could truly make an impact in a swing state, then, Rob Portman in Ohio, or Bob McDonnell in Virginia, would have been far more attractive.</p> <p>If he'd wanted a bona fide policy wonk, Bobby Jindal is an intellectual powerhouse who ran Louisiana's Department of Health and Hospitals at age 25.</p> <p>If he'd wanted a candidate who wasn't another boring white guy, then Jindal, again, or Florida's Marco Rubio, would have fit the bill.</p> <p>If he'd wanted a VP with blue-collar cred, then Tim Pawlenty is about as \"Walmart-shopper\" as they come.</p> <p>Or if he'd wanted to go with an outsider? Jindal again, or New Jersey's Chris Christie.</p> <p>Or what about a working mother? He could have chosen Kelly Ayotte, a conservative from the swing state of New Hampshire who was a tough-as-nails attorney general before becoming a US senator.</p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <p>I may be missing something, but in electoral terms, Paul Ryan for VP makes little sense to me. There are other candidates who do what he does better \u2013 and Ryan has liabilities they don't.</p> <p>It is worth noting also that vice-presidential picks rarely make much difference in general elections. But my judgment is that if Paul Ryan's selection does have any effect on this election, then it won't be in the direction Romney had wished.</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney's decision to put Paul Ryan on the White House ticket has seemingly done that rarest of things in American politics: delighted both sides of the party divide in equal measure.</p> <p>Republican grandees gushed over the youngish star of the GOP, even those \u2013 such as former House speaker Newt Gingrich \u2013 who had previously dismissed his tax plan as \"right-wing social engineering\".</p> <p>Meanwhile many Democrats were also whooping it up over the decision, in the belief that the pick would be unpopular with the public at large due to the swingeing spending cuts Ryan proposes.</p> <p>Bill Burton, a former White House staffer and founder of leading Obama Super Pac Priorities USA, tweeted: \"Romney picked one of the only people who could have had an impact in the race. But, not the way he wants.\"</p> <p>It was a view that many shared.</p> <p>Over at the Washington Post, liberal-leaning columnist Ezra Klein suggested that the move could play into president Barack Obama's hands.</p> <p>He wrote: \"Romney's original intention was to make the 2012 election a referendum on President Obama's management of the economy. Ryan makes it a choice between two competing plans for deficit reduction.</p> <p>\"This election increasingly resembles the Obama campaign's strategy rather than the Romney campaign's strategy.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, Timothy Noah at the New Republic described the VP pick as a \"fantastic stroke of luck\" for Obama.</p> <p>\"Presidents presiding over the sort of economy we have right now don't usually get re-elected. But a president handed the opportunity to run against a GOP ticket that's unabashedly in favor of abolishing Medicare \u2013 something even the Tea Party opposes \u2013 would probably win in November,\" Noah wrote.</p> <p>There was no immediate reaction from the White House. But Jim Messina, Obama's campaign manager, took little time before he went on the offensive.</p> <p>\"As a member of Congress, Ryan rubber-stamped the reckless Bush economic policies that exploded our deficit and crashed our economy. Now the Romney-Ryan ticket would take us back by repeating the same, catastrophic mistakes,\" he said</p> <p>Many commentators have suggested that plumping for Ryan was a 'high risk, high reward' strategy.</p> <p>Those on the political right, tended to focus on the reward part of that equation.</p> <p>Former governor of Florida Jeb Bush, described it as a \"courageous choice\".</p> <p>\"Congressman Ryan's command of economic policy and the federal budget will prove invaluable as Governor Romney fights to reform government, accelerate job growth and rein in the out-of-control spending that has been a hallmark of President Obama's years in office,\" Bush said.</p> <p>Media mogul Rupert Murdoch tweeted: \"Thank God! Now we might have a real election on the great issues of the day. Paul Ryan almost perfect choice.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, Newt Gingrich has seemingly had a change of heart since dismissing Ryan's tax plan earlier on in the primary season.</p> <p>\"We're very, very happy,\" he told CNN, adding that the young Republican had grown into \"one of the great intellectual leaders\" in America today.</p> <p>As to that \"right-wing social engineering\" comment, it appears that Ryan had \"listened carefully\" to the former House speaker in recent months and had now learned the error of his ways.</p>",
  "<p>For the second time, vice-president Joe Biden will face off against a Republican opponent on the bottom half of a presidential ticket.</p> <p>Though Paul Ryan may not appear as strikingly different from Biden as Alaska governor Sarah Palin was in 2008, the firebrand Wisconsin congressman is a formidable and contrasting opponent.</p> <p>Here are some of the key points of difference between the two vice-presidential candidates.</p> <h2>Age</h2> <p>Joe Biden is no spring chicken. He was born in 1942 as the second world war raged in Europe and Asia. He is now silver-haired and 69 years old, none of which is unusual in Washington DC, especially in the Senate where Biden spent so much time.</p> <p>Ryan, however, is a self-titled <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/11/paul-ryan-firebrand-wisconsin-profile\">Republican 'young gun'</a>.</p> <p>Just 42 years old, he was born in 1970: the first ever person on a presidential ticket from the \"Me Decade\". He is also a fitness fanatic and avid hunter.</p> <h2>Experience</h2> <p>Ryan may come across as a youthful breath of fresh political air compared to Biden, but there is the question of experience to consider.</p> <p>Biden has been at the heart of American power for four years already as the incumbent vice-president.</p> <p>Before that he spent long years in the Senate, first being elected in 1970 when he was just 30.</p> <p>He became a specialist in foreign policy, frequently travelling abroad and involving himself in often bitter foreign conflicts, something he has continued as vice-president.</p> <p>Ryan, however, has little practical experience outside Washington.</p> <p>Biden also had a career as a lawyer before he became a politician. Ryan basically went straight to Washington. He also has focused almost entirely on domestic policy issues. That lack of foreign experience was a notorious weakness for Palin.</p> <h2>Debating skills</h2> <p>Ryan is no slouch when it comes to debating. He is a confident speaker and, as a budget specialist, he has a mastery of facts and figures at his fingertips.</p> <p>He is, in short, about as far from Sarah Palin as you can get. Biden on the other hand is a successful politician, fluent and passionate.</p> <p>But he is also well known for making verbal gaffes and has a tendency \u2013 like many senators \u2013 to speak for far too long.</p> <p>In a famous exchange in Baltimore in 2011, Ryan had a brief public debate with President Barack Obama over fiscal issues.</p> <p>Ryan held his own and it made him a conservative hero. Biden just about beat Palin in 2004 in their face-off (and some would even debate that, saying Palin did better).</p> <p>Ryan will be a very different proposition.</p> <h2>Background</h2> <p>Neither man has quite the compelling story of a personal journey of President Barack Obama. Or the colourful wonder of a Sarah Palin (a moose-hunting beauty queen turned state governor and mom of five).</p> <p>Ryan's background is solidly middle class and midwestern. He does not have Mitt Romney's wealth and privilege, instead hailing from a small city in Oklahoma. Biden's background is a little more blue collar.</p> <p>He was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and had a slightly more hardscrabble life than Ryan as his father went through a period of struggling for work.</p> <p>But neither man can claim to have been born to true poverty in the way that, say, Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid can.</p> <h2>Religion</h2> <p>Both men are Roman Catholics, so religion, at least, is likely to be an area of common ground and not something for too much debate (unlike Palin whose evangelical beliefs attracted a lot of unfavourable media attention).</p> <p>However, Ryan is staunchly anti-abortion whereas Biden is pro-choice.</p>",

He returned to the microphone to acknowledge his mistake and reintroduce him as the next vice-president.</p> <p>A Romney adviser said he made the choice after returning from a trip to England, Israel and Poland a fortnight ago. He phoned others on the shortlist on Friday night.</p> <p>The Republican presidential challenger, who until now has been careful to avoid offering detailed economic policies, will now face questions about whether he supports all or just some of Ryan's $5.3tn debt-cutting plan.</p> <p>Romney, in his first interview accompanied by Ryan, defended the proposed Medicare reform. He told CBS: \"What Paul Ryan and I have talked about is saving Medicare, is providing people greater choice in Medicare, making sure it's there for current seniors...But looking for young people down the road and saying, 'We're going to give you a bigger choice.\"</p> <p>Obama, in his first public response to the Ryan announcement, branded him \"the ideological leader of Republicans in Congress\". </p> <p>Speaking at a fund-raising event in Chicago, Obama said: \"He is a decent man, he is a family man, he is an articulate spokesman for governor Romney's vision but it is a vision that I fundamentally disagree with.\" He listed several differences - abortion, gays, energy and the war in Iraq - but did not mention Medicare.</p> <p>There has been intense pressure over the last few days from conservatives, particularly the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal, in favour of Ryan.</p> <p>The timing of the announcement was odd, early on a Saturday morning rather than a prime-time television slot, and on a weekend dominated by Olympic coverage.</p> <p>Ryan, 42, who has been a Congressman from Wisconsin for 14 years, may give Romney an edge in that and other midwest states.</p> <p>Polls show Obama opening up a narrow lead over Romney nationally and 5% or more in Wisconsin.</p> <p>Speculation about a vice-presidential running mate had focused on a shortlist that included: senator Rob Portman; senator Marco Rubio \u2013 in the hope that he might help bring over Latino voters \u2013 and the boisterous governor of New Jersey Chris Christie.</p> <p>Wild cards included former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and general David Petraeus.</p> <p>The Obama campaign described Ryan as \"the mastermind behind the extreme GOP budget plan\".</p> <p>Jim Messina, the Obama campaign manager, said the Republican ticket would return the nation to \"reckless Bush economic policies that exploded our deficit and crashed our economy\" and end Medicare.</p> <p>The prospect of changes to Medicare could have a potent effect on the election. When Ryan first proposed it, there was backlash from its main beneficiaries, those aged 65 and over, worried over the prospect of losing their cover.</p> <p>Romney, conscious of the danger, got in an early counter-attack. \"We will preserve and protect Medicare and social security and keep them there for future generations,unlike the current president, who's cut Medicare funding by $700bn,\" Romney said.</p> <p>Ryan's speech was dominated almost entirely by an attack on Obama's economic record. \"We find ourselves in a nation facing debt, doubt and despair. This is the worst economic recovery in 70 years,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Unemployment has been above 8% for more than three years, the longest run since the Great Depression.\"</p> <p>The choice of running mate does not normally matter, apart from controversial choices such as Sarah Palin.</p> <p>The vice-presidential candidate, after an initial flurry of interest, tends to retreat to the shadows, apart from the vice-presidential debate in the autumn. But Ryan looks as if he is going to have a bigger than usual impact.</p> <p>Ryan's debt-reduction plan will be picked over in the coming weeks by the Obama campaign.</p>",
  "<p>Even before the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/11/paul-ryan-mitt-romney-vp-live\">official announcement of Wisconsin congressman Paul Ryan as Mitt Romney's vice-presidential pick</a>, the secret service escort, the multiple \"insider\" confirmations, and especially the launch of the verified <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulRyanVP\">@PaulRyanVP Twitter account</a> had brought near-certainty to the speculation of recent days. This election, we now know, will be fought by the Republican nominee with the chairman of the House budget committee at his side. That brings great promise \u2013 and tremendous peril \u2013 for the GOP ticket.</p> <p>The merits of Representative Ryan are obvious to anyone paying attention to his endeavors, especially in the past three years, in which he has emerged as a leading voice countering the president's fiscal flim-flammery, which has plunged the country ever further into ruinous debt. Conservatives cheered when Ryan reduced Barack Obama to stumbling deferrals at the February 2010 healthcare summit, with direct and aggressive questions rooted in the fiscal data which the Wisconsin congressman has long since mastered.</p> <p>If one accepts the contention that the great crisis of American governance is really a crisis of entitlements and their funding, then Paul Ryan has been at the forefront of the effort to craft serious solutions. And it's a pity the House Democrats have resolutely refused to join him in it.</p> <p>But there's a reason they don't, and it's not simply their reflexive preference for those programs and their excesses. Ryan's collected ideas for meaningful reform constitute both the 2012 and 2013 House Republican-proposed federal budgets. Known collectively as the \"Ryan plan\", they poll consistently poorly, managing at best a break-even point in some polls, depending on public attention and circumstance. (For example, <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2011/07/florida-against-ryan-medicare-plan.html\">Public Policy Polling last year found it losing by 16 points in Florida</a>, and 23 in North Carolina.)</p> <p>Whatever the Ryan plan's objective merits \u2013 and they are considerable, and considerably better than anything the president has to offer \u2013 this is the ground truth: it's unpopular. And the Republican House that puts it forth is even less popular, clocking in at a mere <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/congressional_job_approval-903.html\">17.2% approval in the latest RealClearPolitics average</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>This brings us to the considerable peril for the Romney effort inherent in the Ryan pick. Every re-election effort is a referendum on the incumbent, but hitherto, the only incumbent in play was Barack Obama. Now, there's another: Paul Ryan and the Republican House. Democrats who had to defend the lackluster governance of the Obama years are now given the superb gift of a man who arguably shares blame for them. The contention that Paul Ryan is as responsible for the failures of the Obama administration as Obama himself is deeply preposterous, of course \u2013 but that doesn't mean the Democratic campaign won't make it. And given the outcomes of past confrontations between this Congress and this White House, there's a good chance it will work.</p> <p>Consider, too, the core value proposition of the Romney campaign: actuarial competence, business acumen, and sound management. Paul Ryan accentuates all these. And that's the problem: he amplifies the existing Romney sales case, rather than expands it. As it happens, Ryan is also a solid social conservative: a faithful Catholic and family man. Whether he'll be allowed to make that appeal in coming months, in a campaign that has shown no appetite for it, remains to be seen.</p> <p>Finally, note that the Republican presidential nominee, the one man in America who cannot credibly attack the president on Obamacare, has chosen <a href=\"http://ivn.us/2012/08/11/a-closer-look-at-rep-paul-ryans-voting-record/\">a man who voted for Tarp</a>. In fairness, that's a lot of people: but don't expect Team Obama to fail to note it.&#xa0;</p> <p>Mitt Romney, with this pick, has decided to run not on his own record and his ideas, but on those of Paul Ryan and the Republican House in which Ryan has been an intellectual and animating force. Like the genius of acquisition he used to be, he identified external assets and grabbed them.</p> <p>In a sense, given the paucity of his own ideas and narrative, it's a good move. But it highlights exactly that deficiency, and the assets come with tremendous liabilities. In Paul Ryan, Republicans now have a man who would make an intellectually forceful and coherent vice-president \u2013 surely a welcome change from the hapless nonentity that is Joe Biden. But they also have a man who brings great danger to the ticket's electoral proposition. In that light, it's a Hail Mary pass \u2013 when all that was needed was to advance the ball five yards.</p>",
  "<p>When it came to the biggest single decision of his run for the presidency so far, Mitt Romney defied his stereotype as a cautious politician eager to please whatever audience he is speaking to.</p> <p>For his choice of congressman Paul Ryan \u2013 a young firebrand politician from the heartland state of Wisconsin \u2013 as his running mate in the 2012 White House race represents anything but politics as usual.</p> <p>Ryan, 42, is one of the so-called \"young guns\" of the Republican party in Washington, a group of politicians aiming to revitalise the party's brand and cast it as more revolutionary and activist, especially in the area of overhauling government spending. For that is where Ryan's main area of influence lies.</p> <p>First elected to Congress at the young age of 28, Ryan has emerged after 14 years in the Capitol as the powerful chairman of the House Budget Committee, determined to wield the axe on matters fiscal and slash American government in size. That has made him a Tea Party hero.</p> <p>His proposals on the budget have been hailed by his supporters as a way to save America from going broke as it struggles with a wave of retiring baby boomers and a vast amount of debt.</p> <p>His political opponents, however, cast his plans as a brutal attack on the poor aimed at stripping away or transforming cherished \u2013 and vital \u2013 benefits like Medicare and social security and food stamps.</p> <p>However, troubled times are something Ryan does know something about on a personal level.</p> <p>Unlike the vastly moneyed Romney, who was born the son of a state governor and an auto-industry magnate, Ryan's background is more modest and marred by tragedy.</p> <p>He was born in Janesville, Wisconsin, on 29 January 1970, in the south of the state, amid a region of rolling hills, farms and small towns struggling with the decline of American industry.</p> <p>His father, Paul Ryan Sr, was a successful lawyer, in Janesville, and from a long established prominent Roman Catholic family in the town. It was a stable and solidly middle class family ideal that Ryan himself has replicated.</p> <p>He remains a Catholic, married Oklahoma-raised tax lawyer Janna Little in 2000 and has three children.</p> <p>But Ryan's childhood was not always easy. His father died when Ryan was just 16 years old.</p> <p>Indeed Ryan \u2013 the youngest of four children \u2013 discovered his stricken parent in bed, laid low by a fatal heart attack at just 55.</p> <p>That trauma in 1986 forced Ryan's mother, Elizabeth, to go back to college to study interior design and his grandmother, who suffered from Alzheimer's disease, to move back in with them to help with the family.</p> <p>In a New Yorker magazine profile Ryan described the death of his father as a huge moment in his life.</p> <p>\"It was just a big punch in the gut. I concluded I've got to either sink or swim in life,\" Ryan told the magazine.</p> <p>It also made him a fitness buff as he realised that the sort of heart attack that felled his father might run in his family.</p> <p>Ryan is a huge fan of an extreme form of workout, called P90X, which involves an intense mix of exercise, yoga and martial arts moves.</p> <p>He is also an avid outdoorsman and hunter, though given his childhood in Wisconsin that is little real surprise.</p> <p>One friend, former congressman Mark Green, told CNN he had sent Ryan an email once from his new job as an ambassador in Tanzania.</p> <p>\"I got this terse response saying, 'I'm sitting in a deer stand. It's hunting season. Leave me alone,'\" Green told the TV station. </p> <p>Ryan went to college at Miami University in Ohio and graduated in 1992 with a degree in economics and politics.</p> <p>After a brief period back in Wisconsin working as a marketing consultant Ryan headed to Washington, landing a job with Wisconsin Senator Bob Kasten, whom he had interned with while a student.</p> <p>He became enmeshed in the world of Washington wheeling and dealing, working as a speech writer and economic adviser.</p> <p>He also professed an admiration for the ideas of anti-government libertarian guru Ayn Rand.</p> <p>By 1997 he decided to run for Congress himself and a year later he won his election battle in his native state and entered the House, becoming its second-youngest member in 1998.</p> <p>He made cutting government and rolling back the welfare state the central tenet of his political beliefs.</p> <p>He first came to national prominence in 2005 when he was a fervent backer of President George W Bush's attempts to reform social security by changing much of it into private investment accounts.</p> <p>But Bush, despite devoting a huge amount of political capitol into the scheme, failed to make it popular with the American people.</p> <p>In the face of withering attacks from Democrats it was eventually abandoned.<br>But not by Ryan. He used his new high profile to keep pushing radical ideas on government spending reform.</p> <p>As the Tea Party emerged in the wake of the economic crises of 2008 Ryan was perfectly situated to ride that wave.</p> <p>His dubbed his budgetary plans the Roadmap, and along with other young guns, such as House majority leader Eric Cantor, pushed transforming the welfare state as an answer to America's economic woes.</p> <p>In the wake of the 2010 mid-term elections, which saw the Tea Party-infused Republicans get control of the House, Ryan ended up in a head-to-head public debate with President Barack Obama over his budget plans.</p> <p>That moment saw Ryan become even more of a hero to Republican conservatives.</p> <p>By 2011 the House had voted on Ryan's budget plan and passed it by 235 votes to 193. Though many Democratic strategists and leaders see Ryan's budget as rich fodder for attacks, that view is not shared by Republicans.</p> <p>When his budget passed the House Ryan's powerful influence was clear: just four Republicans dared vote against it. That showed how Ryan's career has seen him cement his grip on the Republican right.</p> <p>But now, with his name on a presidential ticket, Ryan is about to find out what the rest of the country thinks too.</p> <p>That outcome is far less certain.</p>",
