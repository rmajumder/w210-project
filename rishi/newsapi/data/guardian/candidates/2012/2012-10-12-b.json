Last Christmas one of their organisers asked a child what he wanted for Christmas only to be told that he wanted a blanket to keep out of the cold.</p> <p>\"We never finished the war on poverty that was started in the 1960s\", said Hart as she describes how the organisation operates in half the counties of West Virginia. In some, the run-down coal towns of the south, median incomes are $16,000, barely a third of the US average. Hart says the real unemployment rate is well above 20%.</p> <p>Asked how West Virginia has coped with the recession, she replied: \"There wasn't much here to start with and it's getting worse.\"</p> <p>Poverty and inequality were supposed to big issues in this year's campaign. The growing gulf between rich and poor became a hot issue in 2011 as a result of the Occupy Wall Street protests, and the latest official figures show things getting worse, not better. Of the 34 rich-country members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, only Chile, Mexico and Turkey are more unequal.</p> <p>But for all president Barack Obama's rhetoric over taxing the 1% or the brief firestorm that followed the disparaging remarks Mitt Romney made about the 47% he claimed \"pay no income tax\", many feel the plight of America's poor is being ignored.</p> <p>Martin Gilens, politics professor at Princeton university, said: \"Both parties are highly dependent on affluent donors to fund their campaigns. Neither party has seen it as a particularly advantageous issue to push. That's why inequality has pretty much never been an issue either the Democrats or the Republicans has embraced in this country.\"</p> <p>The share of national income of the richest 1% more than doubled between 1980 and 2008, from 8% to 18%. They make an average of $1.3m in after-tax income, while the poorest 20% take home $17,700.</p> <p>Richard Freeman, economics professor at Harvard, said: \"It's clearly a problem. Even conservatives would see that if the trend were to continue it would be devastating. Imagine the trend going on for another decade or two. Most people would say that would be dangerous\".</p> <p>Already, the risks to the American economy have become apparent. Stagnating real incomes in the three decades leading up to the financial crash of 2007 left many US citizens increasingly hooked on debt. Robert Frank, economics professor at Cornell university says American corporations have forgotten Henry Ford's insight: workers need to be paid wages high enough for them to buy the goods they are producing.</p> <p>West Virginia, the US's second poorest state after Mississippi, has always struggled. The coal mining industry has slashed jobs as it has gone high tech, the steel industry is gone and its mountainous terrain presents physical obstacles to doing business. But in this recession it has been hit yet again.</p> <p>While Romney pledges to cut entitlements, people on a minimum wage of $7.65 an hour struggle to meet even their most basic needs. At the Bread Basket, a drop-off point for Appalachian Outreach in Ritchie County, people line up for food parcels. Grits, dried pasta, tinned food, basic necessities for those whose money runs out at the end of the month.</p> <p>Annie Owens has been organising the drop-off for 28 years and says now is the worst time she can remember. She has had to restrict the handout to the elderly and disabled in order to cope with the demand, \"People put their pride aside and come and get it\", she said.</p> <p>One of those collecting a food parcel, pensioner Barbara Smith, said: \"It's important to us. It helps us go from month to month. You have to make up your mind whether it's your medicine or your food\".</p> <p>Asked whether poverty was an issue in the election for America's politicians, Owens was emphatic. \"This is not an issue for them. If we tell them this is going on they don't believe us. They think we are hillbillies, that this is our choice, that this is the way we want to live. But often it's not choice, it's not the way people want to live our lives. They forget about the small people.\"</p> <p>For some life is getting better. Fracking, the controversial method for producing natural gas, is creating jobs. Pipelines too are being built across the mountainous terrain. There are jobs blowing the tops off mountains for coal. But the majority of these jobs are short term, low paid and benefit free. Once the job is done, there is nothing to fall back on.</p> <p>Hart worries about the environmental impact of allowing energy firms to rip up West Virginia's stunning landscape. \"What do you do for tourism when you blow up a mountain top? People want jobs and there's nothing else,\" she said.</p> <p>Freeman, Gilens and Frank said there were policies that could help: full employment, changes to the tax code to make it more progressive; much greater investment in education; reform of campaign financing to break the stranglehold of rich donors.</p> <p>Obama's healthcare reform apart, there has been little evidence that America's political class is interested in this sort of agenda. Hart said she raised the plight of the people she helps with congressman David McKinley, a West Virginia Republican.</p> <p>She said his response was to say they should get a job. \"He is totally clueless,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>The lone vice-presidential debate is in the books. Joe Biden <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LaughinJoeBiden\">laughed</a>, while Paul Ryan had a <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/08/15/paul_ryan_meet_eddie_munster/\">full head of hair</a>. But did either candidate emerge with an edge that could aid their candidates President Obama and Mitt Romney?</p> <p><strong>Who won the debate?</strong></p> <p>The two scientific polls taken after the debate indicate a split on who won. The <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/109840433/top13\">CNN/ORC</a> poll of debate watcher pegs the margin at 48% for Paul Ryan to 44% for Joe Biden. That's well within the margin of error. It was slightly tilted by the fact that more Republicans watched the debate than Democrats, though a larger percentage of the overall electorate is Democratic. Even so, it seems likely that both Democrats and Republicans were satisfied with their man's debate performance.</p> <p>The other scientific poll, from <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57531059/poll-biden-takes-debate-over-ryan-uncommitted-voters-say/\">CBS/Knowledge networks</a>, had Biden winning among undecided voters by 50% to 31%. The poll did have more Democrats than Republicans, but even allowing for that, it seems Biden won among undecideds in this poll. These undecideds also stated that their view \"for the better\" of Biden increased at a greater rate than they did for Ryan.</p> <p><strong>Will the debate make a difference among undecideds?</strong></p> <p>Among undecideds, the CBS poll found that Romney had led, by 28% to 23%, among those who said they leaned toward voting for one candidate or the other before the debate. After the debate, it was only 33% to 32% in Romney's favor. This change, again, is within the margin of error. And considering the low percentage of undecideds in the electorate, this 4-point closing of the margin makes a difference of maybe 0.3 percentage points in the overall race. That's really nothing.</p> <p><strong>Will the debate fire up Democrats?</strong></p> <p>The reason Mitt Romney can win this election is because polls constantly indicate that Republicans will make up a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/10/romney-v-obama-mixed-signals-polls\">greater percentage of the election day electorate than they do of all registered voters</a>. The first debate helped to feed this likely voter v registered voter gap, to the point where Romney is leading in the vast majority of likely voter polls, while trailing in the majority of registered voter surveys. </p> <p>The issue that argues against believing that this debate will close the gap is that Democratic enthusiasm was at the same levels before the first presidential debate as it was afterwards. Public Policy Polling surveys in both <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2012/10/obama-leads-by-3-in-virginia.html\">Virginia</a> and <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2012/10/obama-lead-down-to-2-in-wisconsin.html\">Wisconsin</a> indicate that it was Republican enthusiasm that rose, thanks to the first debate. The Democrats are at the baseline that they have been at all year.</p> <p><strong>What does history tell us?</strong></p> <p>\"You're no Jack Kennedy\" was probably the most devastating put-down in debate history: uttered by Democrat Lloyd Bentsen, the line is still remembered to this day. Yet, Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis made no ground thanks to that VP debate; in fact, polls had him trailing by a wider margin, post-debate.</p> <p>This finding matches other past vice-presidential debates. There has actually been <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oftc66c-Fyfr-LxD6KpWssZLNtLSa5h2NIsrN_FnwtU/edit\">a slight negative correlation</a> between winning a vice-presidential debate and the top of the ticket gaining in the polls.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397684796\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/12/1350072232328/veepdebates_460.jpg\" alt=\"VP debates' effect in polling\" width=\"460\" height=\"262\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It's certainly possible that historical experience will be proven wrong. I tend to doubt it, though, in this case, as there wasn't really anything outstandingly good or bad for either side. </p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <p>Like all debates, the vice-presidential debate was fun for those who follow this sort of thing. I got a good chuckle over Joe Biden's teeth and Paul Ryan's Eddie Munster-like haircut. The whole affair, however, is likely not to have much of an effect on the presidential contest.</p>",
  "<p>The White House was under intense pressure on Friday to disclose whether any senior administration officials were aware of requests for increased diplomatic security in Libya ahead of the fatal 9/11 attack in Benghazi, following Joe Biden's insistence in the vice-presidential debate that \"we weren't told\".</p> <p>The Republicans have gone on the offensive over Biden's remarks, claiming he misled the American people by claiming ignorance over security concerns in advance of the assault on the US consulate in Benghazi in which the ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed. Early on in the TV debate, the vice-president said: \"We weren't told they wanted more security; we did not know they wanted more security.\"</p> <p>Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, came under repeated questioning during Friday's news briefing about what precisely Biden had meant when he made that comment. The Romney campaign has seized upon testimony given to a congressional committee the day before the debate that suggested requests for beefed-up diplomatic security had indeed been made to the Obama administration before the 11 September attack.</p> <p>Carney said that Biden's \"we weren't told\" remark related specifically and only to the White House. \"The vice-president was speaking about himself and the president and the White House. He was not referring to the administration.\"</p> <p>Carney added that there were countless diplomatic facilities around the world and it was left to security experts in the state department to ensure adequate protection for embassy staff abroad.</p> <p>In a news conference almost exclusively dominated by the Benghazi issue, Carney tried to turn the controversy back on the Republicans by accusing Republican congress members of slashing the budget for diplomatic security \"in order to cut taxes for the wealthiest 2% in this country\". Under the budget proposal of Paul Ryan, Romney's running mate, non-military discretionary funding would be cut by 19% by 2014, which the Obama campaign has calculated would lead to a cut of $300m in embassy security.</p> <p>Carney also accused the Romney campaign of trying to \"politicise this, to turn this into a campaign issue.\" He said: \"That's a shame when we're talking about brave men and women in our diplomatic service who represent the American people.\"</p> <p>But Carney's counter-punches are unlikely to hold back the wave of questions that the Obama administration is now facing over exactly what it knew and when about requests for extra protection in Libya before the attack. The press spokesman repeatedly side-stepped questions from reporters about whether Obama had been informed about several previous threats to attack the Benghazi consulate in the days leading up to 11 September.</p> <p>\"I cannot get into the specific details of a classified briefing,\" he said, adding \"there was no actionable intelligence that suggested there would be an attack at the Benghazi facility.\"</p> <p>As the White House tried to fight back the flames of the Benghazi controversy, leading Republicans fanned them. Newt Gingrich, a failed candidate for the Republican nomination now backing Romney, predicted on CBS television Friday morning that Biden's remarks on Benghazi would \"haunt them from now until the next debate\".</p> <p>A senior Romney adviser, Dan Senor, questioned the administration's grasp of vital national security issues. He said Biden's comment had pointed to \"the larger failures of the administration to be completely transparent about the terrorist attacks in Benghazi and the security situations leading up to the attacks.\"</p> <p>Even before Thursday night's debate, pressure was mounting on the administration over whether it had done enough to protect US diplomatic staff in Libya. On Wednesday the congressional oversight and government reform committee was presented with a diplomatic cable sent on 2 August by Stevens to the state department in Washington asking for an additional 11 security personnel to be added to the rotation of 24. Though the 11 were to replace temporary security staff who were leaving, Stevens made clear in the cable that violence and terrorism were a threat amid a volatile political landscape.</p> <p>He wrote: \"Due to the level of threat in regards to crime, political violence and terrorism, post feels this is an appropriate number of LES [locally employed staff] security personnel needed to further embassy diplomatic outreach missions. Violent security incidents continue to take place due to the lack of a coherent national Libyan security force and the strength of local militias and large numbers of armed groups.</p> <p>\"Host national security support is lacking and cannot be depended on to provide a safe and secure environment.\"</p> <p>The Republican-controlled committee also heard from two former US security chiefs in Libya who testified that they had found it impossible to get the message across back home that security was a critical problem.</p> <p>Andrew Wood, former head of a US military team in Libya, told the committee that \"the security in Benghazi was a struggle and remained a struggle throughout my time there\". He added that the head of US security in the region had pushed for more people \"but was never able to attain the numbers he felt comfortable with\".</p> <p>Eric Nordstrom, the former security chief for US diplomats in Libya, said that in his view he had been fighting a losing battle over numbers in which \"we couldn't even keep what we had\". Pointedly, he said that he concluded after contact with state department bosses that \"we were not going to get resources until the aftermath of an incident\".</p>",

  "<p>Pro-choice jitters over what a Romney administration would do to the reproductive rights of American women have intensified after Paul Ryan indicated in the debate that a Republican White House would overturn Roe v Wade and return control over abortion to individual states.</p> <p>Ryan, the Republican vice-presidential candidate and Romney's running mate, was asked bluntly by the debate moderator, Martha Raddatz, whether pro-abortionists should to be worried by a Romney-Ryan ticket. Ryan replied: \"We don't think that unelected judges should make this decision \u2026 people, through their elected representatives and reaching a consensus in society through the democratic process, should make this determination.\"</p> <p>Earlier, Ryan stated that a Romney administration would be opposed to abortion in all cases other than rape, incest and where the life of the mother was in danger.</p> <p>Reproductive rights groups said that Ryan's comments underlined the threat of a Republican victory next month. Nancy Keenan, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America said that the debate had reminded voters why elections matter.</p> <p>\"The Romney-Ryan ticket is extremely dangerous to women's health, and Americans should be very concerned about the future of women's health and rights if Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan win on November 6,\" she said.</p> <p>Lynn Paltrow, head of National Advocates for Pregnant Women, pointed out that Ryan was a co-sponsor \u2013 alongside the controversial Missouri politician Todd Akin \u2013 of the sanctity of life bill, that would give fetuses full legal rights from conception. \"If that act was ever passed it would immediately provide the basis for states to start arresting women who have abortions and charging them as murderers.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/10/romney-abortion-comments-ryan-differences\">The Romney campaign has been struggling this week</a> to give a clear message over its stance on abortion. Earlier this week, <a href=\"http://blogs.desmoinesregister.com/dmr/index.php/2012/10/09/romney-says-abortion-legislation-isnt-part-of-his-agenda\">in an interview with the Des Moines Register</a>, Romney appeared to be signaling that he would take a moderate position in office, saying that there was \"no legislation with regards to abortion that I'm familiar with that would become part of my agenda\".</p> <p>Hours later, Romney aides reversed that statement with assurances to social conservatives that the Republican ticket was committed to rolling back abortion rights.</p> <p>In the wake of that wobble, anti-abortion groups reacted enthusiastically to Ryan's debate performance. The Susan B Anthony List, a group that opposes abortion, said that Ryan had \"explained the pro-life position with clarity and candor. The Romney-Ryan ticket is clearly committed to protecting American women and unborn children.\"</p> <p>Paradoxically, the easiest way that a Romney presidency could neutralise the grip of \"unelected judges\" on the country's abortion policy would be to change the balance of the US supreme court \u2013 in other words, to appoint new \"unelected judges\" who would take a different view to the current crop of nine. Over the next four years there is likely to be at least one and maybe more vacancies on the panel, with speculation that Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 79, who is firmly in the pro-choice wing of the court, might retire.</p> <p>Joe Biden raised the question of supreme court appointments during the debate, predicting that as president Romney would select \"far right\" justices dedicated to outlawing abortion. The vice-president exhorted voters to \"keep an eye on the supreme court\", arguing that President Obama's two picks \u2013 Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan \u2013 were both \"open-minded\" and \"good justices\".</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama embarked on four days of intensive preparation for next week's showdown with Mitt Romney as he sought to capitalise on Joe Biden's dominant debate performance on Thursday night.</p> <p>Biden eased the pressure on Obama in his clash with Romney's running mate Paul Ryan in Kentucky, overwhelming proceedings with a combative approach that will have lifted Democratic morale but that could risk alienating swing voters.</p> <p>But there is no sign that Romney's surge since the first debate is going away. The latest national Gallup tracking poll released on Friday gave the Republican a two-point, 49-47%, lead over the president. </p> <p>The second clash between Obama and Romney on Tuesday night in Long Island is now shaping up into a 90-minute contest that could decide the race for the White House.</p> <p>Biden overwhelmed opponent Ryan with the kind of aggression that was lacking in Obama's disastrous debate with Romney in Denver last week. But his demeanour in the first half of the contest, which showed him laughing, smirking, talking over and interrupting as Ryan spoke, may have grated with some of the tens of millions of television viewers.</p> <p>Ryan, over breakfast on Friday in Lexington, Kentucky, told reporters he felt great about his own performance and had not felt overwhelmed by Biden. \"No, it was what I expected,\" he said.</p> <p>Obama cleared his diary on Friday, apart from honouring a commitment to dinner with campaign donors, the prize in one of the Democratic party's fundraising drives.</p> <p>He is devoting Saturday, Sunday and Monday almost exclusively to debate preparation for the clash in Hempstead, New York, the second of three presidential debates before election day on November 6.</p> <p>His chief adviser, David Axelrod, speaking in the Spin Rooom in Danville, Kentucky, minutes after the Biden-Ryan debate ended, said: \"The president is looking forward to meeting Governor Romney again next week.\"</p> <p>Asked about the risk of Biden's laughter being seen as rude and irritating to independent voters, Axelrod insisted laughter was inevitable \"when you are debating an opponent who is seriously evading and distorting facts. You react to that.\"</p> <p>The Republican national committee issued a a new web video after the debate, showing clips of Biden laughing, in contrast with a serious Ryan. One of Romney's senior advisers, Ed Gillespie, on Fox television Friday, said: \"I thought it was very disrespectful to the American people.\"</p> <p>Republicans compared it to the 2000 presidential debate in which the Democratic challenger Al Gore lost voters irritated by his sighing and rolling his eyes while George Bush was talking.</p> <p>The architect of the Bush victories, Karl Rove, described Biden as looking \"unhinged\".</p> <p>Democratic congressman Chris Van Hollen, who played the part of Ryan during Biden's debate preparations, told MSNBC: \"I don't think [Biden] was over the top. I thought what you saw was Joe Biden's passion for these issues.\"</p> <p>Before the vice-presidential debate, Republicans had been eagerly anticipating that Congressman Ryan, who has a reputation for being cerebral \u2013 he is the author of a Republican House plan for bringing down the deficit \u2013 would overcome the gaffe-prone and long-winded Biden. But Ryan seemed overcome by Biden's cajoling, forceful debating style.</p> <p>While Biden's performance will have cheered Democratic activists and supporters, it was not a game-changer capable alone of arresting the slide in Obama's fortunes. The consensus among US commentators was that the debate was a draw.</p> <p>The US electoral map has changed dramatically in the week since the Denver debate, with Obama's poll ratings sliding and Romney now marginally ahead or at least even with the president nationally and in most of the eight swing states. The Real Clear Politics website, which averages out the daily polls, has Romney on 47% and Obama on 46% nationally. Romney is three points ahead in North Carolina and two in Florida, with Obama three points ahead in Iowa. But the two are statistically tied in Ohio, Virginia, New Hampshire, Nevada and Colorado.</p> <p>Apart from Biden's facial expressions, Republicans claimed the vice-president had made a major gaffe when he denied that there had been a request by US security forces in Libya to retain or increase protection staff at the embassy and the consulates. The state department admitted at a Congressional hearing on Wednesday there had been such a request.</p> <p>In the debate, Biden was adamant: \"We weren't told they wanted more security there. \"We did not know they wanted more security.\" This comes after a series of conflicting statements from the Obama administration over what happened at the Benghazi consulate attack in which US ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed.</p> <p>Former House Republican speaker Newt Gingrich, told CBS television: \"Biden on Benghazi was so wrong last night. It's going to haunt them from now until the next debate.\"</p> <p>During the Kentucky debate, Biden, talking about Iran and Syria, tried to portray the Romney-Ryan ticket as leaning towards taking the US into another conflict, one that war-weary Americans did not want. \"Facts matter,\" he said, lecturing Ryan on the details of Iran's nuclear programme, saying it was not yet close to achieving a weapons capability.</p> <p>On domestic policy, Biden pushed Ryan on plans to cut the tax bills of the wealthy, saying they did not need it, and also questioned how Ryan could get the deficit down. Biden said no one in history had managed to do this.</p> <p>\"Jack Kennedy lowered tax rates, increased growth,\" Ryan said. \"Oh, now you are Jack Kennedy?\" Biden asked sarcastically.</p> <p>It was a refrain of the most famous vice-presidential debate quote in US political history when the Democratic nominee Lloyd Bentsen, told Dan Quayle he was \"no Jack Kennedy.\"</p> <p>At several points in the night, Biden dismissed points made by Ryan as \"malarkey\".</p> <p>Ryan got in a hit when he got personal, noting that unemployment in Scranton, Pennsylvania \u2013 Biden's hometown \u2013 had risen. But when Ryan went on to say, \"That's how things are going all across America,\" the vice-president interrupted. \"That's not how things are going. You don't read the statistics,\" he said, referring to the drop in unemployment to 7.8% announced last Friday.</p> <p>Biden raised the secret video in which Romney was dismissive of 47% of the population as freeloaders, a line that Obama singularly failed to bring up last week, to the dismay of Democrats. Ryan said the 47% remark was not what Romney had meant to say.</p> <p>Biden may join the race for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, a race that could pit him against Hillary Clinton, and this performance will have helped him with the constituency that matters, Democratic activists. If Romney fails to win next month, Ryan is among potential Repbublican contenders in 2016. While Biden dominated the debate, Ryan made no gaffes and did not harm to his chances in 2016.</p>",
  "<p>As widely as his performance is being praised among Democrats, vice-president Joe Biden is not, on this morning after, enjoying uniformly rave reviews.</p> <p>He smiled too much in the face of weighty issues, detractors say. Or he was too aggressive, treating Paul Ryan rudely at times and potentially alienating the gentle viewer at home.</p> <p>CNN political analyst Gloria Borger was one of many to call out Biden for chuckling audibly. \"It was condescending at times to Paul Ryan,\" she said. \"I think I could have done with a lot less eye-rolling and chuckling on the part of Joe Biden.\"</p> <p>Spinning after the debate, Romney adviser Dan Senor said Ryan was serious and Biden wasn't: \"Congressman Ryan looked like a vice-president, he was serious, he respected the viewers,\" Senor said. \"He was prepared to have a serious, adult discussion \u2026 as for Vice-President Biden's demeanor, I'll let you be the judge of that.\"</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/12/joe-biden-paul-ryan-debate-politics-live\">Follow today's Guardian politics live blog here</a></p>",
  "<p>There was, perhaps, only ever going to be one winner of our public poll of the buildings shortlisted for the RIBA Stirling prize. On one hand there was the Olympic Stadium, the building beamed daily on to the nation's screens, as a setting for untrammelled joy and delirium. On the other, there were five thoughtful, well-crafted, middle-sized projects, tucked away in various more-or-less obscure parts of various cities all over the country.</p> <p>The projects in Wakefield, Belfast, Cambridge and Glasgow are all in parts of their cities that take a bit of finding. Even the Rothschild HQ, which is in the centre of the City of London, tries to be as unobtrusive as a glass banking tower can be.</p> <p>So, it is like a choice between a big chocolatey pile of profiteroles from the sweet trolley to finish your meal, or a slice of one of the subtle, complex, geographically inventive offerings from the cheese board. Put like that, it is striking that the cheese vote, albeit split five ways, beats the profiteroles 62 to 38.</p> <p>It is also striking that top of the non-stadium votes is the Hepworth in Wakefield, a building whose uncompromising grey exterior seems to go out of its way to earn the label \"bunker\" or \"concrete monstrosity\" in the local press. It succeeded in attracting both epithets before it was built, but now visitors seem to appreciate that there can be a virtue in plainness, especially as a prelude to a rich and satisfying sequence of interior spaces.</p> <p>Nonetheless, as far as the Stirling prize itself is concerned, the stage would seem to be set for a classic face-off between popular and professional taste. Most architects and critics I know seem to regard a victory for the stadium as almost as shocking a prospect as one by Mitt Romney in the US presidential election. They see a somewhat basic structure, with a kitschy coronet of triangular lighting fixtures on top, versus works of artistry and depth, which reveal more the more you look at and experience them.</p> <p>I wouldn't share their horror if the stadium won. It seems to me to do its job well, with a pleasing directness and economy. My quibbles would be that, although it looks like a work of the \"new austerity\", its price (\u00a3130m) was not especially austere. Also, that it was designed to be demounted, which is a nice idea, but for political reasons this will almost certainly not happen.</p> <p>But it would still be an opportunity lost if the judges chose the stadium at Saturday night's prize-giving dinner. There are not enough chances to recognise artistry, depth etc, and things like the extraordinary quality with which the Sainsbury Laboratory is made, or the spatial richness of the Lyric theatre. Part of the value of awards like the Stirling should be that they point out qualities that are not immediately obvious, that they do more than reinforce what everyone already knows.</p> <h2>Our poll results:</h2> <p>Olympic Stadium, London \u2013 38%</p> <p>The Hepworth, Wakefield \u2013 28%</p> <p>Lyric theatre, Belfast \u2013 14%</p> <p>Maggie's Centre, Gartnavel Glasgow \u2013 8%</p> <p>The Sainsbury Laboratory, Cambridge \u2013 8%</p> <p>New Court, Rothschild Bank, London \u2013 4%</p>",
  "<p>\u2712 I don't know why the Tories call it a conference, because no conferring goes on. These days it's just a series of dreary PowerPoint lectures without even the benefit of PowerPoint. The delegates \u2013 elderly folk and aggressive young persons in expensive threads \u2013 merely sit there. Occasionally they will give a standing ovation for a favourite \u2013 Boris, or William Hague \u2013 but most of the time they rest in a morose and passive silence. Nobody from the floor is allowed a word. Hague's famous speech as a 16-year-old could not happen now.</p> <p>Stewards go round the hall, telling people to move down and to the centre, so that the place will look fuller. (Only one citizen in 340 now belongs to the Conservative party; in the 1950s they claimed 3 million members.)</p> <p>The real action is on the fringe, which gets larger every year. Unsurprisingly, Boris's great return, like the Ayatollah Khomeini to Iran, began at a fringe meeting on Monday night. Apart from the jokes, one reason Boris is so popular is that instead of banging on about intangible things like aspiration, he talks about what people fret about in real life: buses, bikes, crime, middle-class housing.</p> <p>\u2712 In his speech, David Cameron said bafflingly: \"There is nothing complicated about me.\" Try as I might, I can't work out what this means. A rule of politics says that if the opposite of a remark is clearly nonsense, then it wasn't worth saying in the first place, eg \"I am tortured day and night by existential angst, a bewildered soul tossed on the oceans of moral flux!\"</p> <p>\u2712I arrived in the hell called Birmingham New Street station on Sunday. I then spent about half an hour \u2013 with a map \u2013 trying to find my hotel, which is actually five minutes' walk from the station, if you can find the back entrance, which no visitor can. I thought that after we have spent tens of billions and ruined some of the loveliest countryside in Britain to build HS2, and so shave 20 minutes off the journey from London, we will then spend all the time saved trying to find our destination in Brum, either on foot or through the city's impenetrable switchback road system. I bet we'll feel it really wasn't worth it.</p> <p>\u2712The contrast between the glum and tedious Tory conference and the Cheltenham literary festival \u2013 where I spent last weekend plugging the new edition of my book Life's Too Short To Drink Bad Wine \u2013 was enormous. By its first day, the festival, which ends this weekend, had taken more bookings than it sold tickets for the whole of last year's event. They will probably get more than 130,000 bums on seats, which is nudging the total number of Tory party members across the country. And the audiences are alive, alert, bubbling with questions and contributions.</p> <p>\u2712It turned out this week that Sir John Gurdon, the cell scientist who has won the Nobel prize for biology, had a disastrous record at school and was written off by his teachers. I feel sorry for teachers, who, like social workers, are never allowed to get it right. We've all read about film stars who were told to look for work as librarians. But can you imagine a careers teacher saying, \"accountancy, lad? I wouldn't even bother trying. No, rock music is where you'll find the big money these days.\"</p> <p>In the same way, we never hear about the teachers who predicted glittery futures for people who went on to become office managers or drive a minicab. One of the brightest people in my year at university was a historian who had dazzling exam results in his first two years, then got a third at the end, took a modest job on a newspaper, and died of drink. Another was a philosopher of whom great things were predicted. He went on to make a living repairing musical instruments.</p> <p>\u2712I bumped into a former Northern Ireland minister this week. He was surprisingly gloomy about the state of affairs in the province. Fully 95% of all children are educated in single-religion schools, and though the numbers of young persons are rapidly falling, these schools are never merged with each other. Instead, pupils are bussed, often long distances, to prevent them mixing with the other lot. He also said that it was clear to him that some children in Catholic schools were being abused: \"I could see it in their faces.\" But when he raised it with the Northern Ireland Office, they told him not to stir things since the church was the only Catholic organisation that ever stood up to the IRA. In other words, there was a choice: to let children go on being abused, or to increase the likelihood of more people being killed. There's a dilemma I'm glad I never faced.</p> <p>\u2712It looks quite likely now that Mitt Romney will be the next US president of the United States \u2013 another Republican (think both Bushes; Reagan) for us to look down on. I am not quite as horrified as I might be. The point about Romney is that he can believe anything necessary at any time (see the Doonesbury strip this past week.) He is no ideologue. He would run America as if it were a giant corporation. An adventure like the Iraq war would be less likely, since he would run a cost-benefit analysis and decide against it.</p> <p>On the other hand, we'll still keep our fingers crossed for Obama.</p> <p>\u2712Reader Harry Harrison sends a leaflet that came with a purchase he made. \"Read these operational and safety instructions carefully \u2026 keep in a safe place. If you hand this product on to a third party you MUST also pass on all documents relating to the product. Use for other purposes may cause injury and damage. WARNING: danger of death and accidents for toddlers and children.\"</p> <p>It's a mouth organ. I suppose kids might try to swallow it.</p>",
  "<p>Republicans have gone on the offensive over Joe Biden's insistence during the vice-presidential debate that the Obama administration was unaware of any request for more security in Libya before the fatal 9/11 attack on the US consulate in Benghazi.</p> <p>The Romney campaign is smelling blood over the remarks in which Biden protested that there had been no knowledge of a security problem before the assault in which the US ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed. \"We weren't told they wanted more security, we did not know they wanted more security,\" the vice-president said.</p> <p>In an otherwise bullish and assured performance, Biden's comments left him exposed to post-debate criticism from conservatives intent on sustaining the past week's surge of the Romney campaign. The vice-president's position appeared to be contradicted by evidence presented to the congressional oversight and government reform committee just a day earlier.</p> <p>Newt Gingrich, a failed candidate for the Republican nomination now backing Romney, predicted on CBS television Friday morning that Biden's remarks on Benghazi would \"haunt them from now until the next debate\".</p> <p>On Tuesday the committee was presented with a diplomatic cable sent on 2 August by Stevens to the state department in Washington asking for an additional 11 security personnel to be added to the rotation of 24. Though the 11 were to replace temporary security staff who were leaving, Stevens made clear in the cable that violence and terrorism were a threat amid a volatile political landscape.</p> <p>He wrote: \"Due to the level of threat in regards to crime, political violence and terrorism, post feels this is an appropriate number of LES [locally employed staff] security personnel needed to further embassy diplomatic outreach missions. Violent security incidents continue to take place due to the lack of a coherent national Libyan security force and the strength of local militias and large numbers of armed groups.</p> <p>\"Host national security support is lacking and cannot be depended on to provide a safe and secure environment.\"</p> <p>The Republican-controlled committee also heard from two former US security chiefs in Libya who testified that they had found it impossible to get the message across back home that security was a critical problem.</p> <p>Andrew Wood, former head of a US military team in Libya, told the committee that \"the security in Benghazi was a struggle and remained a struggle throughout my time there\". He added that the head of US security in the region had pushed for more people \"but was never able to attain the numbers he felt comfortable with\".</p> <p>Eric Nordstrom, the former security chief for US diplomats in Libya, said that in his view he had been fighting a losing battle over numbers in which \"we couldn't even keep what we had\". Pointedly, he said that he concluded after contact with state department bosses that \"we were not going to get resources until the aftermath of an incident\".</p> <p>During the debate, Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney's running mate, accused the Obama administration of having an \"unravelling\" foreign policy and pressed Biden hard on Benghazi, saying: \"This was Libya, a country we knew had al-Qaida cells. And we did not give our ambassador in Benghazi a marine detachment?\"</p> <p>By protesting \"we weren't told\", Biden may have referred to the White House or the president and his immediate circle, in which case it may be consistent with the revelations about requests to the state department for additional Libyan security. But he will now come under pressure to clarify his position, which could extend the Benghazi controversy for one or more news cycles, causing further headaches for the Obama re-election campaign.</p> <p>It also leaves him vulnerable to the accusation that the administration was out of touch with what was happening on the ground in Libya. That was seized upon by the Romney campaign, whose senior adviser, Dan Senor, questioned the administration's grasp of vital national security issues. He said Biden's statement had pointed to \"the larger failures of the administration to be completely transparent about the terrorist attacks in Benghazi and the security situations leading up to the attacks\".</p>",
  "<p>The lady to the left of me had seen her four times before. The man to the right of me (my friend Terry) had flown in from Hawaii to see her, with seven of his friends. One of the two sisters we met in the bar before the show had put down $6,000, once, to see her in Vegas, which was absolutely worth it, she said, even though she can't stand her politics.</p> <p>When <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/13/arts/music/a-sentimental-and-glorious-brooklyn-homecoming-for-streisand.html?_r=0\">Barbra Streisand stepped out on stage in Brooklyn for the first time since high school</a>, she could have hummed the telephone book and the crowd would still have loved her. (To give you an idea of constituency: the biggest cheers of the night went up during the photo montage for a street sign of Nostrand Avenue and a shot of Judy Garland.)</p> <p>\"Who says you can't go home again?\" said Babs, and off she went.</p> <p>These were notional, if not literal, Brooklynites. While the rest of the country stayed in to watch the VP debate, most of New Jersey was moving around the Barclays Center, patiently queuing for the loo, putting down $14 for a gin and tonic and wondering vaguely what they'd done with their parking tickets.</p> <p>Two hours before the concert, a lone Babs nut stood outside the auditorium with a welcome home sign, mobbed by cameras with nothing else to report. Slowly, the numbers swelled and the conversations followed a familiar pattern: fan oneupmanship, reminiscences of other concerts and, like evangelicals at a revival, story swapping of what brought them to Babs in the first place.</p> <p>For the sisters in the bar, it was a life-long love. \"I look like Barbra and my sister looks like Bette Midler,\" explained the Streisand lookalike, while her sister shot her daggers and held out Babs-like talons for a photo-op.</p> <p>For my friend Terry, it was as a kid, hearing her sing the love theme to the movie Eyes of Laura Mars \u2013 \"second greatest hits album,\" he said automatically, for the benefit of lesser fans.</p> <p>\"Track 10?\" joked a friend.</p> <p>\"Track two, actually,\" said Terry. </p> <p>Two men waiting in line at the concession stand discussed Streisand's work in the 70's. \"You're confusing Woman in Love with Woman in the Moon,\" said one gently, and his friend clapped a hand over his mouth in pure horror.</p> <p>In this context, Streisand herself was almost superfluous to need. But there she was, only half an hour late and backed by a 60 piece orchestra. The opening number, As If We Never Said Goodbye, rung every bead of nostalgia from the occasion, as did Streisand's banter. </p> <p>\"The last time I sung solo here was on somebody's stoop on Pulaski Street,\" she said, and the crowd went wild \u2013 well, as wild as a crowd who nothing short of an earthquake will get out of their seats once they're settled.</p> <p>There had been rumours of a special guest star, which everyone hoped would be Neil Diamond, a fellow graduate of Erasmus High School, but turned out to be Streisand's son, Jason. Poor guy. After enough of his baby photos were flashed on screen to exhaust even this crowd's interest him, out he came, to stand, or rather sing in his mother's blind spot for 10 minutes. (It put one in mind of Portnoy's Complaint, when the mother says adoringly of her son, \"He doesn't even have to open a book \u2013 A in everything. Albert Einstein the Second!\" For a non-singer, Streisand Jnr has a pleasant voice.)</p> <p>Unlike in previous shows, there was no moment of Ultimate Babs Narcissism, which reached its apex in 1994 when she dueted with two versions of herself, an onscreen playback and a singing 10 year old brought on to represent Streisand the Child. </p> <p>There was, however, a moving rendition of the Way We Were, dedicated to the late Marvin Hamlisch. \"You'll have to cry for me,\" whispered Terry, \"I'm not a crier.\"</p> <p>Reader, I cried.</p> <p>And then she killed it with People. </p> <p>She kept it thankfully light on politics, swearing she wouldn't tell her fans how to vote and then suggesting anyone who believes in \"a woman's right to choose\" can't in good conscience back Mitt Romney. But she moved swiftly on to close with Happy Days, the perfect exit number. And then she surprised us.</p> <p>Streisand has been famous for so long, one imagines she has no real connection to the life of her audience. But in a pitch-perfect closing joke, she mimicked what every wife would say to her husband the second they left the stadium:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We should have taken the subway.</p> </blockquote> <p>It was old Brooklyn Babs and the crowd's heart broke, for her and for themselves over decades of fanship.</p> <p>There was just one unhappy customer.</p> <p>\"Do you know the score in the Yankees game?\" asked a miserable-looking man of the steward, as he made for the exit on the arm of his wife.</p> <p>\"[<em>Some baseball words</em>]\", said the steward, which depressed him further.</p> <p>Everyone else was walking on air. <br></p>",
  "<p>Numerous commentators (including me) were complimentary of the performance of Martha Raddatz as the moderator of <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/12/transcript-vice-presidential-debate/\">Wednesday night's vice-presidential debate</a>. She was assertive, asked mostly substantive questions, and covered substantial ground in 90 minutes. That's all true enough, but the questions she asked reveal something significant about American journalism in general and especially its pretense of objectivity.</p> <p>For establishment journalists like Raddatz, \"objectivity\" is the holy grail. In their minds, it is what distinguishes \"real reporters\" from mere \"opinionists\" and, worse, partisans. As they tell it, this objectivity means they traffic only in straight facts, unvarnished by ideology or agenda. This journalistic code obligates them to speak only from what NYU journalism professor Jay Rosen, citing the philosopher Thomas Nagel, derides as \"the View from Nowhere\", a term Rosen <a href=\"http://pressthink.org/2010/11/the-view-from-nowhere-questions-and-answers/\">explains</a> this way:</p> <blockquote> <p>Three things. In pro journalism, American style, the View from Nowhere is a bid for trust that advertises the viewlessness of the news producer. Frequently it places the journalist between polarized extremes, and calls that neither-nor position 'impartial'. Second, it's a means of defense against a style of criticism that is fully anticipated: charges of bias originating in partisan politics and the two-party system. Third: it's an attempt to secure a kind of universal legitimacy that is implicitly denied to those who stake out positions or betray a point of view. American journalists have almost a lust for the View from Nowhere because they think it has more authority than any other possible stance.</p> </blockquote> <p>Leave aside whether that is even a desirable mindset. The reality is that, as desperately as they try, virtually no journalists are driven by this type of objectivity. They are, instead, awash in countless highly ideological assumptions that are anything but objective. </p> <p>These assumptions are almost always unacknowledged as such and are usually unexamined, which means that often the journalists themselves are not even consciously aware that they have embraced them. But embraced them they have, with unquestioning vigor, and this renders their worldview every bit as subjective and ideological as the opinionists and partisans they scorn. </p> <p>(In fact, one could reasonably make the case that those whose thinking is shaped by unexamined, unacknowledged assumptions are <em>more biased</em> than those who have consciously examined and knowingly embraced their assumptions, because the refusal or inability to recognize one's own assumptions creates the self-delusion of unbiased objectivity, placing those assumptions beyond the realm of what can be challenged and thus leading one to lay claim to an unearned authority steeped in nonexistent neutrality. That is why I believe that journalists who candidly acknowledge their opinions are better at informing others than those who conceal their opinions: conceal them either from others or, as is often the case, even from themselves.)</p> <p>At best, \"objectivity\" in this world of journalists usually means nothing more than: the absence of obvious and intended favoritism toward either of the two major political parties. As long as a journalist treats Democrats and Republicans more or less equally, they will be hailed \u2013 and will hail themselves \u2013 as \"objective journalists\".</p> <p>But that is a conception of objectivity so shallow as to be virtually meaningless, in large part because the two parties so often share highly questionable assumptions and orthodoxies on the most critical issues. One can adhere to steadfast neutrality in the endless bickering between Democrats and Republicans while still having hardcore ideology shape one's journalism.</p> <p>The highly questionable assumptions tacitly embedded in the questions Raddatz asked illustrate how this works, as does the questions she pointedly and predictably did not ask. Let's begin with Iran, where Raddatz posed a series of questions and made numerous observations that she undoubtedly believes are factual but which are laden with all sorts of ideological assumptions. First there is this:</p> <blockquote> <p>RADDATZ: Let's move to Iran. I'd actually like to move to Iran, because there's really no bigger national security...</p> <p>RYAN: Absolutely.</p> <p>RADDATZ: ... this country is facing. </p> </blockquote> <p>Ryan's interruption made it difficult to hear whether Raddatz said that there is \"no bigger national security<em> threat</em> the country is facing\" or \"national security <em>issue</em>\". Either way, the very idea that Iran poses some kind of major \"national security\" crisis for the US \u2013 let alone that there is \"really no bigger national security\" issue \"this country is facing\" \u2013 is absurd. At the very least, it's highly debatable.</p> <p>The US has Iran <a href=\"http://www.juancole.com/2011/12/iran-has-us-surrounded-all-right.html\">virtually encircled militarily</a>. Even with the highly implausible fear-mongering claims earlier this year about Tehran's planned increases in military spending, that nation's total military expenditures is a <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/02/04/the_growing_iranian_military_behemoth/\">tiny fraction of what the US spends</a>. Iran has demonstrated no propensity to launch attacks on US soil, has no meaningful capability to do so, and would be instantly damaged, if not (as Hillary Clinton <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Vote2008/story?id=4701724&amp;page=1\">once put it</a>) \"totally obliterated\" if they tried. <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/barak-israel-very-far-off-from-decision-on-iran-attack-1.407953\">Even the Israelis</a> are clear that <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17837768\">Iran has not even committed itself</a> to building a nuclear weapon.</p> <p>That Iran is some major national security issue for the US is a concoction of the bipartisan DC class that always needs a scary foreign enemy. The claim is frequently debunked in multiple venues. But because both political parties embrace this highly ideological claim, Raddatz does, too. Indeed, one of the most strictly enforced taboos in establishment journalism is the prohibition on aggressively challenging those views that are shared by the two parties. Doing that makes one fringe, unserious and radical: the opposite of solemn objectivity.</p> <p>Most of Raddatz's Iran questions were thus snugly within this bipartisan framework. At one point, she even chided Biden for appearing to suggest that Iran may not be actively pursuing a nuclear weapon: \"You are acting a little bit like they don't want one\" (Biden, of course, urgently disclaimed any such view: \"Oh, I didn't say \u2013 no, I'm not saying that\"). To the extent that she questioned the possibility of attacking Iran, it was purely on the grounds of whether an attack would be tactically effective, citing former defense secretary Bob Gates' warning that that such an attack \"could prove catastrophic, haunting us for generations\", and then asking: \"Can the two of you be absolutely clear and specific to the American people how effective would a military strike be?\"</p> <p>Note what Raddatz did not ask and never would. Even after both candidates re-affirmed their commitment to attacking Iran to prevent it from acquiring a nuclear weapon (Biden dismissed Gates' warning about an attack by saying that \"it could prove catastrophic, <em>if we didn't<br>do it with precision</em>\"), there were no questions about whether the US would have the <em>legal or moral right</em> to launch an aggressive attack on Iran. That the US has the <em>right</em> to attack any country it wants is one of those unexamined assumptions in Washington discourse, probably the supreme orthodoxy of the nation's \"foreign policy community\". </p> <p>Worse, even after Biden boasted about the destruction of the Iranian economy from US sanctions \u2013 \"the ayatollah sees his economy being crippled. \u2026 He sees the currency going into the tank. He sees the economy going into freefall\" \u2013 there was no discussion about the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/07/iran-santions-suffering\">severe suffering imposed on Iranian civilians by the US</a>, whether the US wants to repeat the mass death and starvation it brought to millions of Iraqis for a full decade, or what the consequences of doing that will be.</p> <p>In sum, all of Raddatz's questions were squarely within the extremely narrow \u2013 and highly ideological \u2013 DC consensus about US foreign policy generally and Iran specifically: namely, Iran is a national security threat to the US; it is trying to obtain nuclear weapons; the US must stop them; the US has the unchallenged right to suffocate Iranian civilians and attack militarily. As usual, the only question worth debating is whether a military attack on Iran now would be strategically wise, whether it would advance US interests.</p> <p>One can say many things about the worldview promoted by her questions. That it is \"objective\" or free of ideology is most certainly not one of them.</p> <p>Exactly the same is true of Raddatz's statements and questions about America's entitlement programs. Here is the \"question\" she asked to launch the discussion:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Let's talk about Medicare and entitlements. <em>Both Medicare and Social Security are going broke</em> and taking a larger share of the budget in the process.</p> <p>\"Will benefits for Americans under these programs have to change for the programs to survive?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>That social security is \"going broke\" \u2013 a core premise of her question \u2013 is, to put it as generously as possible, a claim that is dubious in the extreme. \"Factually false\" is more apt. This claim lies at the heart of the right-wing and neo-liberal quest to slash entitlement benefits for ordinary Americans \u2013 Ryan predictably responded by saying: \"Absolutely. Medicare and Social Security are going bankrupt. These are indisputable facts.\" \u2013 but the claim is baseless.</p> <p>As the Pulitzer Prize-winning former New York Times economics reporter David Cay Johnston has <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/04/column-dcjohnston-socialsecurity-idUSL1E8G3N0C20120504\">repeatedly explained</a>, this is the primary demonstrable myth being used by the DC class \u2013 which largely does not need entitlements \u2013 to deceive ordinary Americans into believing that they must \"sacrifice\" the pittances on which they are now living:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Which federal program took in more than it spent last year, added $95 billion to its surplus and lifted 20 million Americans of all ages out of poverty?</p> <p>\"Why, social security, of course, which ended 2011 with a $2.7 trillion surplus.</p> <p>\"That surplus is almost twice the $1.4 trillion collected in personal and corporate income taxes last year. And it is projected to go on growing until 2021, the year the youngest Baby Boomers turn 67 and qualify for full old-age benefits.</p> <p>\"So why all the talk about social security 'going broke?' \u2026 The reason is that the people who want to kill social security have for years worked hard to persuade the young that the social security taxes they pay to support today's gray hairs will do nothing for them when their own hair turns gray.</p> <p>\"That narrative has become the conventional wisdom because it is easily reduced to a headline or sound bite. The facts, which require more nuance and detail, show that, with a few fixes, Social Security can be safe for as long as we want.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>That Medicare is \"going broke\" is as dubious and controversial a claim as the one about social security. <a href=\"http://www.cjr.org/swing_states_project/medicare_bankruptcy_cnn_gets_i.php\">Numerous</a> <a href=\"http://www.cepr.net/index.php/blogs/beat-the-press/robert-samuelson-shows-that-the-post-has-no-fact-checkers-on-its-opinion-pages\">economists</a> and <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/a-bipartisan-foul-medicare-is-going-broke/2012/09/20/7237057e-0373-11e2-91e7-2962c74e7738_blog.html\">fact-checking journalists</a> have documented quite clearly why this claim is misleading in the extreme.</p> <p>Yet this claim has also become DC orthodoxy. That is because, as the economist Dean Baker <a href=\"http://www.cepr.net/index.php/blogs/beat-the-press/robert-samuelson-shows-that-the-post-has-no-fact-checkers-on-its-opinion-pages\">has explained</a>, \"Social security and Medicare are hugely important for the security of the non-rich population of the United States,\" and \"for this reason\" many Washington media outlets and think tanks \"hate them\".</p> <p>Nonetheless, Raddatz announced this assertion as fact. That's because she's long embedded in the DC culture that equates its own ideological desires with neutral facts. As a result, the entire discussion on entitlement programs proceeded within this narrow, highly ideological, dubious framework. As Jonathan Schwarz <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tinyrevolution/status/256599242431397888\">put it</a> after the debate:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397686792\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/12/1350044777910/schwarz.png\" alt=\"schwarz tweet\" width=\"460\" height=\"202\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>That is what this faux journalistic neutrality, whether by design or otherwise, always achieves. It glorifies highly ideological claims that benefit a narrow elite class (the one that happens to own the largest media outlets which employ these journalists) by allowing that ideology to masquerade as journalistic fact. </p> <p>These establishment journalists are creatures of the DC and corporate culture in which they spend their careers, and thus absorb and then regurgitate all of the assumptions of that culture. That may be inevitable, but having everyone indulge the ludicrous fantasy that they are \"objective\" and \"neutral\" most certainly is not.</p> <h2>Miscellaneous debate matters</h2> <p>In the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/12/vice-president-debate-reaction\">reaction I wrote</a> shortly after the debate ended, I said that Biden repeatedly denounced Ryan for having \"voted to put two wars on a credit card\" even though Biden did the same thing. It was actually worse than that, as Biden seemed at one point strongly to imply that he voted against those wars:</p> <blockquote> <p>And, by the way, they talk about this Great Recession if it fell out of the sky, like, 'Oh, my goodness, where did it come from?' It came from this man voting to put two wars on a credit card, to at the same time put a prescription drug benefit on the credit card, a trillion-dollar tax cut for the very wealthy. I was there. I voted against them. I said, no, we can't afford that.</p> </blockquote> <p>Like much of what Biden says, this is far from a model of clarity, but it would at least lead a reasonable listener to believe that Biden voted against the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. But not only did he vote to authorize (and repeatedly fund) both, but he was the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 2002 and his support for the attack on Iraq played a major role in shaping a pro-war discourse and then leading so many Democrats to support it.</p> <p>One more note about Raddatz: near the end of the debate, she asked the two Catholic candidates how their religion influences their views on abortion. This was a reasonable question unto itself, but also reflects standard DC assumptions on these issues.</p> <p>It is often noted that the Catholic Church stridently opposes reproductive rights. But it is almost never noted that the Church just as stridently <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,80875,00.html\">opposes US militarism</a> and its economic policies that continuously promote corporate cronyism over the poor. Too much emphasis on that latter fact might imperil the bipartisan commitment to those policies, and so discussion of religious belief is typically confined to the safer arena of social issues. That the Church has for decades denounced the US government's military aggression and its subservience to the wealthiest is almost always excluded from establishment journalistic circles, even as its steadfast opposition to abortion and gay rights is endlessly touted.</p>",

  "<p>There are two gestures now essential to understanding South African politics. One is a rolling hand motion as practised by football fans when calling for a player to be substituted. The player they want yanked off is the president, Jacob Zuma.</p> <p>The other is the cupping of a hand at a downward angle to represent a shower head \u2013 a mocking reference to Zuma's six-year-old gaffe about <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4879822.stm\" title=\"\">showering after having sex with an HIV-positive woman</a>, of which the cartoonist Zapiro constantly reminds him.</p> <p>Both these gestures were prominent, accompanied by much singing and stomping, at Thursday night's launch of the <a href=\"http://mg.co.za/article/2012-10-10-deep-read-zuma-regime-kgalemas-hopes-and-concerns\" title=\"\">authorised biography </a>of Kgalema Motlanthe, Zuma's deputy and his only credible challenger in an African National Congress (ANC) leadership contest in December.</p> <p>Indeed, this was less a book launch with wine-sipping literati than a raucous anti-Zuma rally attended by top dissidents Tokyo Sexwale, Mathews Phosa and rebels from the ANC youth league. In the absence of US-style presidential debates in South Africa (Zuma v Thabo Mbeki a few years ago would have been an amusing clash of styles), this was the closest thing the rank and file could get to a proper look at Motlanthe.</p> <p>For it could be argued that Motlanthe's principal strength in the presidential race is that he isn't Zuma. The 63-year-old is a private man and opaque politician; few voters would be able identify a clear Motlanthe agenda. He is the tabula rasa on to which the \"anyone but Zuma\" campaign can project their hopes and, perhaps, wishful thinking.</p> <p>The publication of his biography, therefore, risks letting in daylight upon magic. At the launch in the great hall at Johannesburg's Wits University, Ray Hartley, editor of the Sunday Times, said: \"I think this book does introduce South Africa to Kgalema Motlanthe for the first time.</p> <p>\"It does give us our first detailed picture of the deputy president. Those of us in the fourth estate have been scratching around to try to work out who is the man who was the third president of South Africa.\"</p> <p>Third president? Yes, Motlanthe was a kind of caretaker president for seven months after Mbeki was ousted and before Zuma won the 2009 general election. But president he was. The record will always show that he wore the crown and so does my memory. On <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/apr/14/david-smith-south-africa\" title=\"\">my first day covering Africa for the Guardian</a>, I attended a press conference with President Motlanthe specifically for foreign journalists (more than three years later, we are still waiting for Zuma to do the same).</p> <p>In fact, South African journalists mining advance copies of the biography are yet to come up with a blockbuster revelation. There have been tales about Motlanthe saving Zuma from expulsion from the party, Motlanthe disagreeing with the decision to expel the youth leader Julius Malema and Motlanthe expressing discontent over various government failings. But still little to fire up voters either way.</p> <p>\"The man is truly a biographer's delight,\" the author, the former trade unionist Ebrahim Harvey, told the audience on Thursday night, implying that Motlanthe will not be losing much sleep over its contents.</p> <p>Harvey said he had spent almost 200 hours with the politician over three years (adding that Mbeki only gave his biographer 45 hours). \"He decided to open up his mind both personally and politically in this biography,\" he said. \"It was a very courageous step.\"</p> <p>Motlanthe is a man with nothing to hide, he continued. Even when a newspaper falsely claimed that Motlanthe was having an affair with a 24-year-old, not once was he \"morose, dejected, looking troubled\", but instead showed \"amazing fortitude\".</p> <p>Harvey insisted that the timing of the book's publication, just two months before the leadership election in Mangaung, was pure coincidence. But then he took a swipe at the ANC over its response to the deadly unrest sweeping the country's mines. \"The ANC pretence that we don't have a social crisis in this country is quite ridiculous. In that respect the timing for me is much more important than Mangaung.\"</p> <p>Next up was the man himself \u2013 like Zuma, a former inmate on Robben Island. Motlanthe was, as ever, charming and cerebral but not exactly charismatic. \"I thought a political biography has got to be written by someone who is going to be critical and make an assessment of the work we do, the positions we adopt and so on,\" he said. \"I did not want a book that is only about positive issues.\"</p> <p>He then told a story about a trip to Italy where he was impressed by a new teaching method. \"Things are always changing,\" he observed innocently, prompting the biggest roar of the night from a crowd that could see only the subtext of leadership elections.</p> <p>Motlanthe paused. Against whoops and whistles, he continued: \"For me the irony is already lost because I'm talking about \u2026 This is science. It's not about names of places. I can see that you are trapped within the geographic names of Mangaung (where the leadership election will take place). There are many other important things about Mangaung than just the ANC elective conference.\"</p> <p>He ended on a somewhat sombre note. \"I've told my comrade Trevor [Manuel, the planning minister], in my will, I leave very clear instructions when I pass, my obituary or tombstone \u2013 if anybody believes I deserve a tombstone \u2013 should say: 'Others made suggestions and he implemented.'\"</p> <p>Which, in the ranks of political epitaphs, is never going to challenge Abraham Lincoln or Winston Churchill. That apart, we still didn't learn much about the man who would be king (again). The wild cheers seemed to be driven more by out-with-the-old desperation than desire for the new.</p> <p>\"More bloody riddles from the masters of spin, smoke, mirrors and obfuscation,\" remarked one journalist on the way out. \"What does this guy really stand for except ABZ \u2013 anyone but Zuma?\"</p>",
  "<p>In the normal course of events, vice-presidential debates, much like vice-presidents themselves, don't particularly matter. And this may well prove to be the case with Thursday night's confrontation in Kentucky. But if it is, it won't be for lack of trying on the part of Joe Biden, whose high-energy performance \u2013 part angry bar-room debater, part condescending elder uncle, part comic mime artist \u2013 frequently seemed to leave Paul Ryan overwhelmed.</p> <p>On more than one occasion, the Republican candidate visibly gulped. It's dispiriting, of course, that political discourse should have been reduced to such displays of alpha-male dominance, but there were times when the debate might have benefited from a whispering David Attenborough voiceover: \"And so the victorious older male, having bared his cosmetically enhanced teeth, stalks away, muttering: 'With all due respect, that's a bunch of malarkey \u2026'\"</p> <p>To be sure, Biden delivered no knockout blows, while Ryan snuck in a few well-rehearsed lines and didn't lose his composure. But in the wake of Barack Obama's abysmal performance in Denver last week, the nationwide resurgence of Democratic spirits was practically audible. Their biggest worry may have been that the famously gaffe-prone vice-president was going to swear by accident. (\"That's a bunch of stuff,\" he scoffed instead, in response to Ryan's charge that Obama's administration was abandoning Israel. \"A bunch of stuff\", he explained when pressed, means \"malarkey\". Which in this context, it seemed, meant \"bullshit\".)</p> <p>\"Stop talking about how you care about people,\" he interrupted at one point, after Ryan had launched into one of his campaign's stock tales about Mitt Romney's personal saintliness. \"Show me something. Show me a policy. Show me a policy where you take responsibility.\" Bulldozing his way through the 90-minute debate \u2013 excellently moderated by the ABC foreign correspondent Martha Raddatz \u2013 Biden did all the things that Obama supporters had complained the president hadn't, including mentioning Romney's 47% remarks (twice) and striving hard to clarify the mathematical impossibilities of the Romney/Ryan tax plans.</p> <p>Biden is an incorrigible ham. On the split-screen, while Ryan spoke, he could be seen grinning, chuckling, shaking his head, throwing his hands to the skies or hanging his head in exaggerated disbelief, a widely varying sequence of gestures that all amounted to \"can you believe this guy?\" When the questioning turned to religious faith, Biden simply adopted a completely different voice, husky and several tones lower. With exuberant disingenuousness, he referred to Ryan as \"my friend\" more than a dozen times. But it all seemed to work. It worked much better, certainly, than Obama's decision to act as if the split-screen wasn't there.</p> <p>The counter-narrative, which Fox News's talking heads were busily attempting to entrench within seconds of the final applause, was that Biden's laughter, like Al Gore's notorious sighs, would prove a liability in the coming days. Independent voters, according to this version of the conventional wisdom, are alienated by the merest hint of conflict or bullying. Perhaps. The truth, though, is that the debate probably won't make very much difference one way or the other to the balance of support.</p> <p>But it was a shot in the arm for those already on Obama's side, and may thus arrest the spiralling Democratic panic. Just as long as Obama's performance in the next debate, on Tuesday, isn't a bunch of malarkey.</p>",

He was animated in making his points in a way that Obama failed to do and the laughter may have been deliberate, to try to belittle Ryan.</p> <p>On Iran and Syria, Biden tried to portray Ryan as leaning towards taking the US into another conflict, one that war-weary Americans did not want. \"Facts matter,\" he said, lecturing Ryan on the details of Iran's nuclear programme, saying it was not yet close to achieving a weapons capability.</p> <p>On domestic policy, Biden pushed Ryan on plans to cut the tax bills of the wealthy, saying they did not need it, and also questioned how Ryan could get the deficit down. Biden said no one in history managed to do this.</p> <p>\"With all due respect, that's a bunch of malarkey,\" Biden said of Ryan and Romney's plans in general. \"Not a single thing he said is accurate.\"</p> <p>Ryan got in a hit when he got personal, noting that unemployment in Scranton, Pennsylvania \u2013 Biden's hometown \u2013 had risen. But when Ryan went on to say, \"That's how things are going all across America,\" the vice-president interrupted. \"That's not how things are going. You don't read the statistics,\" he said, referring to the drop in unemployment to 7.8% announced on Friday.</p> <p>Biden raised the secret video in which Romney was dismissive of 47% of the population as freeloaders, a line that Obama singularly failed to bring up last week, to the dismay of Democrats. Ryan said the 47% remark was not what Romney had meant to say.</p> <p>But Biden failed to unnerve his younger opponent or to force him into making any gaffes. Ryan even succeeded in forcing Biden into making one error, potentially serious, in relation to the Benghazi attack that left a US ambassador dead along with three other Americans. </p> <p>Biden said the Obama administration had been unaware that there had been a request by security on the ground in Libya to at least keep the size of protection team intact and preferably increase it. But a state department official, giving evidence in front of a Congressional committee on Wednesday, confirmed there had been such a request.</p> <p>Ryan scored another point when he asked why the US ambassador to Paris was protected by a marine detachment but not the ambassador in Libya. \"Our ambassador in Paris has a marine detachment guarding him. Shouldn't we have a marine detachment guarding our ambassador in Benghazi, a place we knew there was an al-Qaida cell with arms?\" Ryan asked.</p> <p>Republicans afterwards focused on Biden's behaviour, in particular what they described as his incessant grinning and smirking, as potentially a vote-loser. Brendan Buck, Ryan's press officer, in the Spin Room, said: \"The big takeout tonight is Joe Biden's dental work. There is a time for laughter. It is not endearing to see a person laughing in a serious debate ... I do not think it will play well with people who saw it on a splitscreen.\"</p> <p>The pressure now switches to Obama to produce an equally good performance against Romney when the two meet in the second of three presidential debates on Tuesday in Long Island, New York. The president, who watched the debate on board Air Force One, said: \"I'm going to make a special point of saying that I thought Joe Biden was terrific tonight.\"</p> <p>Democratic party activists badly needed a lift after a week in which they have expressed dismay and puzzlement over Obama's failure last week and the subsequent dramatic and continuing slide in the polls.</p> <p>The instant snapshots after the debate were mixed. CBS awarded the night to Biden by 50% to Ryan's 31% but CNN put Ryan on 48% to Biden's 44% and CNBC 50% to Ryan and 36% to Biden. These polls tend to be unreliable.</p> <p>Both teams will now anxiously await the first serious polls, though it is unlikely that a vice-presidential debate will make much impact on voter intentions. The main benefit for Democrats is as a morale-booster.</p> <p>Obama's main strategist, David Axelrod, claimed it was a clear win for Biden. \"It was like looking at the school principal debating the student president.\"</p> <p>Asked about the risk of Biden's laughter alienating independent voters, Axelrod insisted laughter was inevitable \"when you are debating an opponent who is seriously evading and distorting facts. You react to that.\"</p>",

  "<figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://p.nowthisnews.com/entry/181/\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://p.nowthisnews.com/entry/181/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>She was calm, articulate and relentless \u2013 and unlike the two candidates, moderator Martha Raddatz of ABC News was the undoubted star of this year's vice-presidential debate. </p> <p>Raddatz never lost control, not of time nor of substance, unlike her predecessor, Jim Lehrer, in last week's presidential campaign debate. She hit all the tough questions expected of a candidate for US vice-president, with a detailed, precise knowledge. She was low-key but gracefully on point enough to steal the show.<br> To Congressman Ryan she said gently on Libya: \"I just want to talk to you about right in the middle of the crisis. Governor Romney, and you're talking about this again tonight, talked about the weakness, talked about apologies from the Obama administration. Was that really appropriate right in the middle of the crisis?\" The rebuke was implied, but all the more effective for being so. It put Ryan on the defensive and Raddatz shone as the woman who had shown him up. She didn't go much easier on Biden either. Biden was like the boy debater who'd had a Red Bull with a Gatorade chaser backstage. He wanted to argue with anyone in sight at the top of his voice till the clock ran out. But Raddatz quietly reined him in. (crosstalk) Biden: \"With all due respect, that's a bunch of malarkey.\"<br>Raddatz: (without a beat) \"And why is that so?\"<br>Biden: \"Because not a single thing he said is accurate.\"<br>Raddatz: \"Be specific.\"<br> <br>She controlled the candidates to the extent that she got them to face (albeit unwillingly at times) the tough topics she had come up with.<br> <br>\"Should the US have apologised for Americans burning Qur'ans in Afghanistan?\" she asked Ryan. \"Should the US apologise for US Marines urinating on Taliban corpses?\"</p> <p>The directness of her approach sped up the debate process even as it occasionally left the candidates struggling for words. But when that happened, she was a helpful prompter.</p> <p>Ryan: \"Oh gosh, yes, Urinating on Taliban corpses? What we should not apologise for \u2026<br>Raddatz: \"Burning Qur'ans immediately?\"<br>Ryan: \"What \u2013 what we should not be apologising for is standing up for our values ...\"<br> <br>Domestically Raddatz took them to task on health, then senior care. And then she came at them with this:<br> <br>Raddatz: \"If your ticket is elected, who will pay more in taxes. Who will pay less?\"<br>As Ryan waffled on detail, she interrupted him.<br>Raddatz: \"Do you have the specifics? Do you have the ...\"<br>Biden (interrupting): \"That would be a first for the Republican Congress.\"<br>Raddatz: \"Do you know exactly what you're doing?\"<br> <br>Specifics, precision, exact answers. This is not a concept that American debates with their waffly pre-planned written essays for answers are used to. By the time Raddatz got to talk to what half the voting population saw as the highlight of the debate, there was real excitement around America's television sets and computer screens, despite a lengthy detour on defence spending and the US presence in Afghanistan.<br> <br>Raddatz: \"We have two Catholic candidates first time on a stage such as this. And I would like you both to tell me what role your religion has played in your own personal views on abortion \u2026 please talk personally about this if you could.\"<br> <br>(I'll distill the answers here in the interest of space)<br> <br>Ryan: \"Why am I pro-life? It's not simply because of my Catholic faith \u2026 It's also because of reason and science \u2026 The policy of the Romney administration will be to oppose abortions with the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother \u2026\"</p> <p>Biden: \"My religion defines who I am \u2026 But I refuse to impose it in equally devout Christians, Muslims and Jews. I do not believe we have a right to tell \u2026 women they can't control their body.\"<br> <br>The thoughtfulness of her questions forced the candidates to reveal more of themselves than perhaps they wanted to. For example, the low-key question at the end: \"If you are elected what can you give to this country as a man as a human being that no one could?\" could have been answered any one of a hundred ways.<br> <br>Which meant that many of the answers could be filled with potholes. How do you define yourself? Do you even try? If you don't, are you missing an opportunity? <br> <br>It did look like something of a copout when instead of responding to Raddatz's opportunity to reintroduce himself, Ryan ducked and returned to spouting economic solutions. The better turn was performed by Biden: \"Look at my record,\" he began before defining himself as someone whose whole life had been about working for improvements for the middle class.<br> <br>At the end of the debate, liberals praised Raddatz for doing a thorough professional job. Conservatives continued to lambast her bias for the fact that Obama had attended her wedding while at Harvard Law School 21 years ago. (She is since divorced.)</p> <p>But of the three personalities on stage there was one clear winner, and it was not a man, nor a candidate. Congratulations, Martha Raddatz.</p>",

And nothing was heard of either of them again.\"</p> <p>It says something about what's going on the top of the ticket that so many would want to hear from the two <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/oct/12/us-election-2012-biden-ryan-video\">vice-presidential contenders</a>. After seven years of running for office, Mitt Romney only managed to introduce himself to the American public in a favourable light last week, and needed to build on that. After six years building a reputation as a formidable orator, Barack Obama managed to come across as a distracted lightweight just over a month before polling day. Since then, erratic polls suggest a volatile electorate which is neither sufficiently satisfied with the incumbent, nor sufficiently impressed by his opponent, to make up its mind. And in a situation where anything can happen, everything matters. Even vice-presidential debates.</p> <p>Both Joe Biden and Paul Ryan were tasked with different goals for the night underpinned by one basic maxim: do no harm. For Biden, known for his logorrhoea, that meant no gaffes; for Ryan, unknown still to most Americans, that meant presenting himself as a plausible candidate to be a heartbeat from the presidency. Both achieved that, though Biden came closest to blowing it.</p> <p>Beyond that, however, Ryan had to continue the upward trend his boss started last week, while Biden had to dig his team out of the hole his boss dug last week. Neither achieved that, although Biden came closest to achieving it.</p> <p>By far the most impressive person on the stage was the moderator, Martha Raddatz. Asking incisive questions, pushing for cogent answers, calmly prodding for clarity and brevity. She kept them in line and, as much as is possible, on point.</p> <p>That was no mean feat. Biden was so combative that at times he appeared thuggish. He badgered, bulldozered, hectored and harassed. At some moments, the debate appeared to owe more to WWE than CNN. This was probably Biden overcompensating for his boss's lacklustre performance last week.</p> <p>Occasionally he overdid it. Where some had questioned whether Obama had taken a sleeping pill, Biden looked like he was on steroids. For much of the evening, this worked. But his digs could be gratuitous, and his exasperation overly theatrical. \"You're Jack Kennedy now?\" he said after Ryan once mentioned the former president. At times the age difference, along with the smirking, eye rolling and forceful interventions, made him look like an angry father taking his impudent son to the woodshed.</p> <p>Ryan parried this well. He was competent, knowledgeable and likeable enough. He broke no hearts and swung no votes. But he turned no stomachs and lost no votes, either.</p> <p>For Biden, however, it was a high-risk strategy to come across so angry, particularly at a time when Democrats are losing women voters. But while he lost some with his aggression, there were others he undoubtedly won over with his authenticity. \"Just get out the way!\" he told Ryan at one point. \"Stop talking about how you care about people and show me something!\"</p> <p>Ryan, though, was so evasive at times that it would have been rude for Biden not to intervene. Asked specifics, either by Raddatz or Biden, Ryan would talk only in generalities. Asked what he would do differently, he would simply offer a marginally different talking point. There were moments when he was so on message that you expected him to end his contribution with the words: \"my name's Paul Ryan and I approved this message.\"</p> <p>No debacle was anticipated and none occurred. No breakthrough was anticipated and none occurred either. They fought to a bloodied draw in which Biden won on substance and Ryan won on style. Now both can sail off to sea, never to be heard of again.</p>",
  "<p><strong>(updated below)</strong></p> <p><em>I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/richard-adams-blog/2012/oct/11/vp-debate-ryan-biden-live#block-50777f26c0e361310bc6ccf1\">contributed one item</a> to the Guardian's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/richard-adams-blog/2012/oct/11/vp-debate-ryan-biden-live\">live blog</a> on tonight's vice presidential debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan, and although I do not typically do this type of punditry (and don't worry: that's unlikely to change), I'm re-printing it here, with a couple of additions, because the debate raises a couple of mildly interesting points:</em></p> <p>This is one of those debates very difficult to judge if you are too immersed in politics. From both a substantive and stylistic perspective, Biden completely dominated the debate. He was far more passionate, authoritative, and aggressive than Ryan. It is a pure reversal of the first presidential debate but on steroids: Biden was actually more assertive and even more lively than Romney was, while Ryan was at times as listless and passive as Obama was.</p> <p>The question is whether average, low-information viewers - also known as \"undecideds\" and \"independents\" - will find Biden's constant smirking, interrupting and obvious contempt for Ryan off-putting. That's possible - those types of viewers typically claim to dislike excess confrontation in politics, and what made Romney effective was that his aggression was restrained and respectful - but ultimately, Americans, their claims to the contrary notwithstanding, respond viscerally to alpha dominance in their political leaders. </p> <p>Biden embodied that attribute, while Ryan often appeared sheepish, intimidated, and bullied. The feel of the debate was an elder, gruff, authoritative political leader running roughshod over a young, chastened, in-over-his-head neophyte. I have no idea how much any of this will matter, but the theatrics were overwhelmingly in Biden's favor, unless it's too confrontational for those watching.</p> <p>Biden was even better on substance than on style. He was extremely effectively in highlighting both the extremism and incoherence of Ryan's ideology, and his forcing Ryan to admit that he sought stimulus money, after trashing the stimulus bill as corrupt, was lethal. Ryan did little to undermine the Obama-Biden platform, but that's because there is not much room to their right, and that's the only place Ryan feels comfortable fighting.</p> <p>Four other points: (1) immediately following the debate, CNN's David Gergen said that Ryan won on style and it was a tie on substance; I really think political commentators in general (including me) have great difficulty knowing how the average viewer reacts to such things, and should acknowledge that; </p> <p>(2) whether the polls show Biden winning or not, this is the type of performance that will please and embolden the Democratic base, probably make them giddy in fact, as it was contemptuous of the GOP and unrestrained in its mockery of their extremism and dishonesty; after Obama's sleepwalking in the last debate, that can be valuable to Democrats; </p> <p>(3) Biden's strutting about how the Obama administration has destroyed Iran's economy with \"crippling\" sanctions turned my stomach, but Ryan's critique was that they had not gone far enough (without ever specifying what more should be done), so they were equally repellent on that; and, </p> <p>(4) Biden continuously attacked Ryan and the GOP for \"voting for two wars paid for with a credit card\"; that's all true, except that Biden did exactly the same thing, and that little unmentioned fact, for me, summarizes most of these matters on the substance.</p> <h2>UPDATE</h2> <p>One commenter objects to my last point by noting that while Biden voted for both wars, he did not vote in favor of the Bush tax cuts. That's fine: but voting for two wars without proposing any way to pay for them (i.e., with a tax increase or spending cuts) is still \"voting for two wars paid for with a credit card\".</p> <p>As for post-debate polls, Ryan apparently won the CNN poll while Biden won the CBS poll, for whatever that's worth and whatever it means. </p> <p>To be perfectly honest, my favorite part of subjecting myself to this spectacle came when I unwittingly left C-SPAN on after the debate was over, and heard a C-SPAN viewer call in and say <a href=\"http://pdfob.tumblr.com/post/33408636830/a-caller-on-c-span-after-the-vp-debate-classic\">this</a>. That made it all worthwhile.</p>"
