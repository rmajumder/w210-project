Twelve years on from Moby developing the idea (and taking it to ubiquity in countless slightly unimaginative homes, restaurants and bars), he has decided on a plan: to make his own music from the moans and twangs of the early 20th-century blues. In truth, his fifth album 12 Bit Blues goes far beyond the tasteful colours of Moby and instead gives the blues a hip-hop overhaul: treating it as form as well as content. One hopes that as well as enjoying Kid Koala's startling rhythms, breaks and surface noise, his followers may want to get into the crates themselves to dig out some gems.</p> <p><strong><em>O2 Academy Islington, N1, Thu; Fiddlers, Bristol, Fri</em></strong></p> <p><em>John Robinson</em></p> <h2>Radiohead, Manchester &amp; London</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397170359\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/4/1349351382876/Radiohead-008.jpg\" alt=\"Radiohead\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Sebastian Edge</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sebastian Edge</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It's funny how Radiohead are now supposedly \"no longer a rock band\" when they spend their live shows playing some of their most exciting guitar music yet.

  "<p>Michelle Obama is the first genuine style icon of the 21st century. Flotus \u2013 to give the first lady of the United States her official title \u2013 has had more impact on what real women wear than anyone else in a&#xa0;decade. As her husband fights for his second term, the first lady's style is as appealing as it has ever been.</p> <p>There have been other glamorous women in the White House. What makes Obama special is the sense of personality and fun she brings to her wardrobe choices. One of her key strategies is to use colour. Right from the beginning of her White House tenure, she has broken all the rules. Her inauguration outfit was in a shade so unusual that fashion commentators worldwide were scrambling to name it even as the presses rolled. (In the end, the consensus was lemongrass.) Choosing a colour that suited her complexion was a celebration of the fact that her skin is a different colour from her first lady predecessors.</p> <p>The Obama look is about taking classically feminine pieces \u2013 full skirts, silk shift dresses, pearls \u2013 and making them modern by editing out anything small-scale or twee. Her prints are graphic and large\u2011scale. Impact-making dresses and statement jewellery are balanced with practical pieces that busy women everywhere can relate to as everyday essentials. Cardigans and ballet pumps are a constant.</p> <p>The key takeaway from Obama's look? Have fun with fashion. Don't be scared of it. If one of the world's most photographed and critiqued fortysomething women can wear cropped trousers, pair bright pink with red, and risk an asymmetric neckline \u2013 then what's stopping the rest of us?</p> <p>\u2022 The Autumn Style Icons series is funded by Boden and editorially controlled by the Guardian to a brief agreed with Boden.</p>",
  "<p>These are some of the things we know about the&#xa0;rising star of the Tory party. David Cameron's glittering understudy outshone the future PM at Oxford, where he was elected president of the union. During a distinguished career as a political journalist, he became the unlikely star of a satirical TV show, and continued to write a newspaper column after becoming an MP. Affectionately indulged across the Westminster spectrum, on account of his charm, his personal appeal transcends party loyalty. Contrary to popular opinion, however, his name is not Boris Johnson.</p> <p>\"People keep talking about Boris becoming prime minster,\" reflects an Oxford contemporary. \"But I think it's going to be <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/michaelgove\" title=\"\">Michael Gove</a>.\"</p> <p>If you have never met the secretary of state for&#xa0;education, and do not vote Tory, you may well be of the view that Gove is a nasty little rightwinger with a reactionary vision to return Britain to the 1950s. If so, the description I hear from practically everyone who has ever crossed his path will sound unrecognisable.</p> <p>\"I have only nice things to say about him,\" is&#xa0;the preface I hear time and again. Gove is, Chris&#xa0;Huhne says, \"The politest man in the House of Commons. Incredibly well-mannered. Much more so than people who come from grander backgrounds.\" A senior Labour figure tells me, \"The truth is, he doesn't act like a Tory. He is far&#xa0;too decent. He's in politics for all the right reasons.\" The political columnist <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/matthew-dancona\" title=\"\">Matthew d'Ancona</a> agrees: \"He is just an incredibly nice guy. A lot of people are very nice&#xa0;guys, 'but' \u2013 and with politicians that can have&#xa0;a very big capital B. But he is an absolutely nice guy. He's not a fair-weather friend at all, he's&#xa0;fundamentally loyal, he is a very empathetic character and very solicitous of people's feelings. I'm yet to come away from a&#xa0;gathering where he&#xa0;hasn't charmed everybody in the room. Michael&#xa0;is&#xa0;a very ironic and incredibly good at taking the piss out of himself; he's one of&#xa0;those people you hope will be at dinner.\"</p> <p>From those who knew Gove as a young child, right through to colleagues today, the unanimity of opinion is almost freakish. George Allan was Gove's headmaster throughout secondary school,&#xa0;\"And when I see Michael on the television now, I&#xa0;can still see the 11-year-old boy. He didn't change&#xa0;his persona throughout his school career. Consistency \u2013 that's the word, consistency. We couldn't claim to be the authors of his remarkable civility. He created his own image.\"</p> <p>If Cameron fails to deliver a second term \u2013 and&#xa0;a&#xa0;clear Tory majority in 2015 is looking like a&#xa0;tall order \u2013 there will almost certainly be a new party leader. With the question of succession becoming a very real issue, the education secretary is a very real contender.</p> <p>In August 1967, a baby called Graham was born in Edinburgh to a young unmarried mother, and became Michael Gove four months later, the adopted son of a couple in&#xa0;Aberdeen. A younger sister was adopted five years later, and the Labour-voting family lived in&#xa0;a small ground-floor flat in a tidy if austere grey&#xa0;terrace, until his father's fish-processing business became successful enough for them to&#xa0;move into a three-bedroom semi.</p> <p>Gove attended his local state primary until the age of 11, when he passed the entrance exam to Aberdeen's most prestigious private school for boys. <a href=\"http://www.rgc.aberdeen.sch.uk/\" title=\"\">Robert Gordon's College</a> dominates the city&#xa0;centre, a relatively short distance from Gove's&#xa0;childhood home but a significant cultural leap. Every day the teenage Gove would set off&#xa0;from his little semi with its neat vertical white&#xa0;blinds and symmetrical hanging baskets, to&#xa0;an imposing&#xa0;granite colossus resembling a Soviet-style Eton. But he made the journey with&#xa0;remarkable ease. He rode an ancient bicycle,&#xa0;carried an umbrella, was fond of wearing&#xa0;suits, and quickly established himself as&#xa0;one of the school's most precocious characters.</p> <p>Mike Duncan taught Gove English and debating, and remembers a star debater and \"endlessly enquiring\" boy who enjoyed testing his teacher by reciting the opening line of a novel&#xa0;and challenging Duncan to name the book. Well&#xa0;read and self-consciously clever, Gove and his friends were big fans of sci-fi role-play games such as Wargame, and another called Nuclear War, which involved building up stocks of weapons and occasionally firing them off. A&#xa0;poem&#xa0;penned in his final year, An Essay On Teaching (With Apologies To Alexander Pope), may or may not make teachers smile today, and satirical entries about the senior boys in 1985 suggest he and his friends were already enthusiastic subscribers to Private Eye.</p> <p>\"Michael Gove: His eventual entrance to Oxfam University has finally confirmed his place among mere immortals. He now earns his money tutoring Mr Duncan in English. Naked without his tweeds, it is Colonel Fogey's ambition to be a&#xa0;listed building when he grows up.\" When Gove&#xa0;was invited back a few years later to take part in a debate, posters depicting a&#xa0;caricature of&#xa0;the Ghostbusters' ghost went up all over the school with the strap line: \"Take Govey down at&#xa0;the debate!\"</p> <p>\"Michael was very much a wit,\" one former classmate remembers, \"and a joy to have around. We were never intimates, but he was friendly, intelligent, a nice bloke. He wasn't cool or fashionable, but he was very popular because he would always have a funny rejoinder, and could outwit the teachers. My childhood memories are peppered with laughter because of Michael. One of the things I valued him for was that he prevented me from being bullied. I had glasses and red hair, and I&#xa0;vividly remember being bullied in the changing room, and Michael tried to stop it.\"</p> <p>Gove arrived at Lady Margaret Hall to study English in 1985. The novelist <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/mar/30/philip-hensher-life-in-writing\" title=\"\">Philip Hensher</a> can still recall watching the freshers arrive, and noticing one dressed in a three-piece green tweed&#xa0;suit. \"It was really a young fogey thing. He&#xa0;seemed a little bit older than he was, but not in a ridiculous way. If&#xa0;there was an element of absurdity to him, he always seemed to be in on it,&#xa0;which is a very attractive characteristic.\"</p> <p>Anthony Goodman was president of the&#xa0;Oxford union when Gove arrived. \"He was one of the most gifted speakers I saw in the union. But he didn't generate any antagonism; he was confident, but not in a pushy, aggressive way. He just seemed like an old head on young shoulders.\" Goodman doesn't think Gove was contriving a performance to get in with the elite social set. \"That's pretty much why&#xa0;I did debating,\" he jokes, \"but not Gove. He&#xa0;came across as classless.\"</p> <p>The broadcaster and journalist <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/samira-ahmed\" title=\"\">Samira Ahmed</a> edited the union magazine under Gove's presidency, and sums up the consensus: \"I&#xa0;just&#xa0;didn't see why anyone could loathe him,&#xa0;personally. He was a 40-year-old trapped in&#xa0;a&#xa0;20-year-old's body \u2013 but it was totally sincere. There's nothing fake about him at all. He&#xa0;exuded intelligence, and was very grown up for his age. And thinking big political thoughts, on a scale very few of us at that age were thinking. His vision was fully formed at 20.\" Another contemporary, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/toby-young\" title=\"\">Toby Young</a>, agrees. \"He wasn't a&#xa0;work in progress like the rest of us. He seemed to arrive fully formed.\"</p> <p>Gove encountered his first ever setback after graduation, when a job application to the Conservative Research Department was rejected on the grounds that he was \"insufficiently Conservative\". So he returned to Aberdeen and joined the <a href=\"http://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Press And Journal</a> as a trainee reporter. Within months, the paper went on strike.</p> <p>The father of chapel, Iain Campbell, recalls the staff's initial unease about Gove. \"We knew he was a Tory, and our concern was&#xa0;to have a united front. So we spoke to Michael, and he was happy to come on board. He&#xa0;wasn't a typical striker by any means, but he&#xa0;was very articulate, so we asked Michael to come&#xa0;to the European parliament in Strasbourg to lobby MEPs. He was a very good colleague. Being on strike can be very mentally straining, so we used to have parties to keep morale up, and he was someone who would always be there, and always very popular.\"</p> <p>Gove has subsequently said he thought the strike achieved little, and for how long he would have stuck it out we'll never know, for within three months he was offered a job in television, and soon moved south to work for the political programme <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/otr/\" title=\"\">On The Record</a>, and then the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/default.stm\" title=\"\">Today programme</a>. In 1992 he was hired by Channel 4 to&#xa0;present a late-night political comedy show, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103555/\" title=\"\">A&#xa0;Stab In The Dark</a>, somewhat to the surprise of&#xa0;his co-presenter, <a href=\"http://www.baddiel.com/\" title=\"\">David Baddiel</a>.</p> <p>\"I thought, I've never seen anyone on late-night alternative TV like this. He&#xa0;was rightwing and looked 53. I think he was wearing a three-piece suit. He wasn't cut from the&#xa0;obvious Tory cloth; he is&#xa0;a&#xa0;very bright bloke and a thinking rightwing person, and I'm always&#xa0;interested in intelligent people who think differently from me. I've had many rows with people I've worked with, but not&#xa0;Michael Gove. He was quite humble. He was&#xa0;always very unaggressive. Not trying all the&#xa0;time to intellectually defeat you in that way&#xa0;that politicians can.\"</p> <p>Around the same time Gove appeared as&#xa0;a&#xa0;chaplain in a feature film set in a&#xa0;boarding school. It was a tiny role, but&#xa0;he'd clearly made a big impression on someone along the way, because the lead schoolboy character was given the name M Gove. Neither the film nor A Stab In the Dark were huge hits, though, and in 1996 Gove joined the Times as a columnist and leader writer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397783251\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349283428073/Michael-Gove-on-an-NUJ-pi-008.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Gove on an NUJ picket line in 1989\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In 1989, while a trainee reporter on Aberdeen's Press And Journal, Gove joined an NUJ picket line. Photograph: Donald Stewart</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Donald Stewart</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Newspaper offices are notoriously fractious places, but staff remember an extravagantly congenial, donnish colleague who would soothe reporters late filing copy with, \"But how <em>are</em> you? Yes, of course, should you so wish to file that would be marvellous, that would be very much appreciated. But it's first important that I&#xa0;know how you <em>are</em>.\" Very much the in-house intellectual, the \"most striking thing about him,\" recalls his former editor, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Stothard\" title=\"\">Peter Stothard</a>, \"was that he could make people on the other side of the argument not only recognise his argument, but also genuinely like him.\"</p> <p>Gove became friends with the rising young Tory stars Cameron, George Osborne and Steve Hilton, and co-founded the centre-right think tank <a href=\"http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Policy Exchange</a>. His influence over the party's modernisation project would be difficult to overstate. The exact nature of his contribution, however, is confusing. Everyone tells me his politics owe everything to his humble origins, and are \"all about creating ladders of opportunity; it's all about things you might call progressive, in terms of goals, but using Conservative means\". He is \"ideologically amphibious\", interested in ideas from the left, \"on a moral mission, to do with helping the poorest\", and responsible for helping to coax his party into the 21st century. Even his political opponents concur. According to a senior Labour party official, \"On sexuality and class and social mobility, on race and gender, he is&#xa0;a genuine liberal.\" He is not, Huhne agrees, \"a&#xa0;traditional rightwinger.\"</p> <p>Then I read every word published under his Times byline up to his election in 2005, and found&#xa0;that Gove the progressive arch-moderniser simply does not fit with the facts. If you want to understand what Tory modernisation really adds up to, it's a highly instructive read.</p> <p>Gove's neo-con hawkishness in foreign policy has always been well known. He called for the invasion of Iraq just two days after 9/11, and before the planes hit the towers he'd already published a column that morning calling for action against Saddam Hussein. A committed Zionist and slavish admirer of George W Bush, a&#xa0;passionate Eurosceptic and staunch defender of&#xa0;British Gibraltar, he regards the Northern Ireland peace process as a shameful capitulation to terrorists, and once wrote a column calling for&#xa0;\"a revival of jingoism\". But where is the evidence in his writing of domestic social liberalism? It doesn't exist.</p> <p>Passionately pro marriage, he opposes statutory paternity pay, stem cell research, euthanasia and contraception for school children, but supports privatisation of both the BBC and the NHS, and proposes the marketisation of immigration policy,&#xa0;whereby a British passport could, he suggests, be sold for \u00a310,000. He is far ruder about the Lib Dems than New Labour, despairs of the \"absurd belief\" that the armed forces ought to reflect the country they serve by recruiting more women and gay men, and takes a&#xa0;robustly bang-em-up approach to law and order. As for supporting public services, Gove can see only one acceptable line: \"The Conservatives could defend public servants from the unjust, unproven and demoralising charge of 'institutional racism',\" the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/1999/feb/24/lawrence.ukcrime12\" title=\"\">Macpherson report</a> being, in his view, an outrage.</p> <p>Why, then, do so many colleagues and political opponents see Gove in this rosier, more moderate light? It has to be because of his debater's gift for according courteous respect to opposing views, creating the impression that he's taken them on board, when he hasn't actually revised his position at all. Everyone tells me how carefully Gove listens, but when asked to recall a single occasion when he has been persuaded to change his mind, to their surprise no one can come up with one. It is a case of manners maketh the impression of a moderniser, for Gove's Tories don't need to be \"inclusive\", or \"tolerant\". The&#xa0;important thing is to look as if they are.</p> <p>He warns the party against \"Social Tone Deafness\", which \"manifests itself in an inability to detect the country's changing mood music\", and calls for candidates who \"look like human beings who understand the daily struggles of modern existence\". But a 2003 column tellingly reveals where Gove ranks the importance of actual policy reform: \"The Tories have not yet adopted a tone, style, culture <em>or even</em> [my italics] a set of policy priorities appropriate for the 21st century.\" A Tory minister and friend of Gove's probably comes closest to the truth when he characterises him as a \"true Conservative, the rightwing conscience of the cabinet. He is a full spectrum, real world Tory; it's all about living in the real world. He would regard the Tory rightwing as completely unrealistic\" \u2013 which is not the&#xa0;same as wrong. Labour MPs like to say Cameron's Conservatives have modernised on only one solitary issue \u2013 homophobia \u2013 and I&#xa0;used to think that had to be&#xa0;too cynical. But in all of Gove's writing it's the only example of an authentically abandoned prejudice.</p> <p>What of Gove's famous passion for social mobility through education? \"His view on social mobility is for people to do what he did \u2013 study classical subjects and go to Oxford,\" argues a Labour critic. \"It's all slightly 'Some working-class people are terribly good at Latin \u2013 give them a chance and you never know!'\" The former Labour schools minister Jim Knight agrees. \"If he thinks social mobility is getting more poor kids into Oxbridge, then I think that's a massively flawed definition. If you are serious about social mobility, it has to be communities and families, not just individuals.\"</p> <p>Interestingly, in 2000 Gove wrote, \"Too many people go to university\", but his columns reveal surprisingly little about the future secretary of state's thoughts on education. For their origins, we need to go back further still, to his old school days. \"He benefited in a life-changing way from a&#xa0;classical liberal education,\" as a close ally puts it, \"and would like that privilege to be extended to people from less privileged backgrounds.\"</p> <p>For all its architectural grandeur, Robert Gordon's College during Gove's era was actually Scotland's second cheapest private day school \u2013 \"more of a glorified grammar, really,\" as a former pupil puts it. About half the boys joined from state primaries, and a quarter received a bursary or scholarship. George Allan and Mike Duncan both assumed Gove had been a scholarship boy, but in fact it was only when his father's business failed in his final year that the family applied for assistance. But every boy had to pass the entrance exam, and the school could operate on the assumption that all pupils would be not merely able, but disposed to work hard.</p> <p>\"When you enter Gordon's and start wearing the blazer and tie, you sort of absorb the traditions of the college,\" a former teacher tells me. \"Those kids from poorer economic backgrounds tried to climb upwards, not pull the others down.\" When&#xa0;I&#xa0;ask Allan what sort of disciplinary problems he used to deal with, he looks surprised. \"Well, if I&#xa0;had one a term, that was enough for me.\" The current acting head says the worst he's encountered was a boy kicking about a plastic bottle who ignored his request to put it in the bin.</p> <p>Gove has always spoken highly of his old school, and when I visit I can see why. But while I'm admiring its orderly classrooms and general air of cheerful application, a teacher puts into words what I find myself thinking. \"The trouble with anyone's own experience of school,\" the teacher points out, \"is that it's so formative that it informs all your ideas about education. That's very natural, but not necessarily a good thing.\"</p> <p>From the age of 11, Gove never shared a desk with anyone who struggled to read and write, or who experienced school as&#xa0;an intimidating trauma instead of a golden ticket. \"His prime concern is to make sure&#xa0;that there are safe schools in cities for people&#xa0;like him,\" says a columnist who has followed his career closely. \"All this nonsense that&#xa0;free schools are free \u2013 they are not, they are Michael Gove schools. He is trying to create a system in which middle-class parents like him can make uses of the state system without having&#xa0;to mix with the rough boys.\"</p> <p>Following his election in 2005, Gove wrote, \"The&#xa0;reason why I'm in Parliament is not really to see my colleagues win power, it is to see us at last in a position where we can give it up.\"</p> <p>But since taking office, he has awarded himself more than 50&#xa0;new powers, including rules allowing him to acquire land from local authorities and private companies to help him increase the number of academies and free schools. This autumn 55 new free schools will open, taking the total to 80, and the number of academies has risen tenfold to more than 2,300, each one accountable not to local authorities, but to the secretary of state himself. \"He is a High Tory control freak who wants to run every school in the country,\" counters the critic of Gove's \"free\" school rhetoric. \"He hasn't got a localist bone in his body.\"</p> <p>There are other curious paradoxes. A friend for more than 20 years has never once heard him mention money, and says he regards it with unworldly indifference. But in 2002 Gove wrote about living perennially beyond his means \u2013 \"Ever since going up to university, I&#xa0;have accumulated new debt, and new means of becoming indebted\". And when the expenses scandal broke, it emerged that he'd spent \u00a37,000 of taxpayers' money on designer furniture, much of it from Cameron's mother-in-law's interior design company.</p> <p>Another puzzle was his use of private email addresses to communicate with his team. Everyone says Gove has a practically courtly deference to protocol, but he was plainly breaking the rules. Gove pleaded an innocent failure to master his own departmental technology, and his physical ineptitude is legendary; being driven by Gove is, apparently, a \"terrifying\" experience. Whether techno-klutziness explains an arrangement that conveniently kept secrets from hostile civil servants, however, is unclear.</p> <p>For a man known to be meticulously conscientious, Gove's ministerial career got off to an oddly bumpy start. In the early months, he drew criticism for awarding a grant to a Jewish schools security trust on whose advisory body he had sat [see footnote], and then there was the botched cancellation of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_Schools_for_the_Future\" title=\"\">Building Schools For The Future</a> programme, and confusion over the number of schools wishing to become academies. Gove blamed sabotage by his own department \u2013 in a colleague's words, a \"ministerial blooding\". But last year he hired a special adviser who'd been previously blackballed by Andy Coulson, called Dominic Cummings. \"And you could almost feel,\" says a senior aide, \"that the moment Dom came to join him, things started getting back on track.\"</p> <p>Earlier this year, Gove leaked to the Daily Mail his plan to restore O-Levels, sidestepping departmental and Lib Dem opposition to court the rightwing press, whose praise was predictably rapturous. Issuing every school in the country with a leather-bound King James bible inscribed with the words, \"Presented by the secretary of state for education\" surely did more for Gove's profile than&#xa0;for the nation's spiritual improvement. At \u00a3370,000, it was a pricey gesture, but private donors comprised almost exclusively of rightwing Christian financiers were happy to foot the whole bill. Gove's other big idea this year was pricier still \u2013 a new \u00a360m royal yacht for the Queen as a diamond jubilee present. It was clearly never going to happen, but sent another signal to the right, as did his audacious hymn at the Leveson enquiry to the virtues of \"one of the most impressive and significant figures of the last 50 years\", Rupert Murdoch. \"Cummings is a really amazingly effective political street fighter,\" the aide says, \"the wily operator he needed. Since then, Michael has felt a new sense of confidence.\"</p> <p>Gove's confidence extends well beyond his existing role. Most cabinet ministers haven't the energy or political courage to discuss their colleagues' policies in any detail; Gove isn't one of them. \"Michael does have an opinion on everything,\" says <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/timmontgomerie\" title=\"\">Tim Montgomerie</a>, editor of <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/\" title=\"\">Conservative Home</a>, \"and he talks in cabinet a lot.\" One cabinet minister describes him as \"being slightly inclined to go off on a bit of a rant off his own brief\", and an aide describes his role as the \"energetic challenger \u2013 especially of the system, and of conventional wisdom\". And yet, says another minister firmly, \"I can't think of anyone who sees him as a political rival.\"</p> <p>How could Gove possibly not be seen as a political rival? He may be Osborne's closest ally, but in the opinion of one Lib Dem minister is \"substantially cleverer\". He is Cameron's \"closest&#xa0;friend in politics\", helping him prepare for PMQs, feeding jokes into his speeches, and he&#xa0;\"can be quite dazzlingly funny, brilliant at doing impressions\", a friend reports. \"I've heard him do what must be a set piece, in which he does a great impression of Huhne condescending to Clegg in cabinet, that had the whole table in stitches. Genuinely funny satire.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397783252\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349282180167/Michael-Gove-on-a-New-Yea-008.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Gove on a New Year's Day walk in 2011 with the Cameron family and friends \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On a New Year's Day walk in 2011 with the Cameron family and friends, including Tim Burton and Helena Bonham Carter.

They&#xa0;are in and out of each other's houses, kids and nannies everywhere, they are each others' kids' godparents, their kids go to the same schools. The question of succession doesn't cross their minds.\"</p> <p>The question is whether it crosses Gove's.</p> <p>Just how far does Gove's ambition go? \"At&#xa0;Oxford it was obvious that some people were warming up for the Commons,\" Samira Ahmed recalls. \"With&#xa0;Boris Johnson, his plan was obvious. But I&#xa0;never heard that said about Michael.\" Former colleagues at the Times assumed for a&#xa0;while that he would become their editor, \"But he wasn't seen as someone angling for his own personal promotion at all.\" Gove has always insisted he has no interest in leading his party, saying, \"I&#xa0;don't have it in me. I don't have what it takes.\" And yet, as Matthew d'Ancona observes, \"You can&#xa0;never assume that a politician who has devoted his life to the game will walk away from the chance to be leader or PM. It's ridiculous for us to think that any politician might.\"</p> <p>A lot of very wealthy Tories presumably agree, for Gove's constituency office last year received five times the party's national average sum of donations. Individual and corporate donors gave&#xa0;Gove, who occupies one of the safest seats in the country, more than \u00a360,000 \u2013 almost twice the sum received by Osborne's office and three times more than Cameron's. What exactly are they funding?</p> <p>Nobody believes Gove would ever challenge Cameron for the leadership. And Gove had always&#xa0;assumed that, when the succession did come, the heir would be Osborne. But now that&#xa0;the chancellor is becoming unelectably damaged goods, and talk of a Johnson leadership bid gathers momentum, few think Gove would simply stand by and watch London's mayor move&#xa0;into Downing Street. If the party needs a&#xa0;Stop Boris candidate, it will be Gove.</p> <p>Does he have what it takes? Former colleagues are unsure. \"He is an intellectual, not a man of&#xa0;the&#xa0;people, and whether he could operate in&#xa0;an&#xa0;environment in which not very many people knew who <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiro_Agnew\" title=\"\">Spiro Agnew</a> was I don't know.\"&#xa0;I ask his old boss, and Stothard chuckles. \"I think by common consent the job of home news editor wasn't his natural home. News editors, unless they're hated half the time, are not&#xa0;really on top of their job. Was Michael able to&#xa0;do the throwing the typewriter thing? No. He&#xa0;didn't have the temperament for that role. I&#xa0;don't really believe in pop psychology, so I'm reluctant to go into this very far, but he is quite thin-skinned. Perhaps too sensitive to be home news editor \u2013 or prime minister.\"</p> <p>Someone else who knows Gove well agrees that at first he tended to flap when things didn't&#xa0;go smoothly. \"This 'I haven't got what it takes' line, I think what he was referring to was this thing of coping with the ups and downs and the crap you get. The relentless roller-coaster and inevitable failures. He previously might have been a bit insecure about his ability to cope&#xa0;with adversity, but I think that has gone now. I think that has changed. If you'd asked me&#xa0;18 months ago, do you think he could and should aim to be PM one day, I would have said&#xa0;no. But now I think Michael could.\" There's&#xa0;some speculation that the decision will ultimately fall to his wife, the Times columnist <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/tag/sarah-vine\" title=\"\">Sarah Vine</a>, but no agreement on which way she'll go.</p> <p>\"I think she adores being a Tory wife,\" says one friend. \"The more pictures she can be in with Sam Cam, the better her life becomes.\" But another disagrees. \"I've heard people say that, but I don't think she's a scheming Machiavellian political wife, pushing her husband's career.\" She has a funny way of going about it if she is, featuring marital anecdotes in her column that render him a faintly absurd eccentric.</p> <p>The couple met at the Times, married in 2001, and live with their daughter and son, nine and seven, in a modest terraced house at the Wormwood Scrubs end of North Kensington, where dinner is \"a standard middle-class set up; completely informal, non matching furniture, child-centred, you can't move for books, the kids are usually up. Sarah does most of the cooking \u2013 meat and two veg or pasta, no bought in food or waitresses or any of that nonsense \u2013 and Michael's pouring the wine. It's jolly and cosy and warm and about having fun.\"</p> <p>And if Vine's wider family wind up as Downing Street in-laws, then by all accounts they should provide fabulous entertainment. \"A totally mad, bonkers, crazy family,\" a friend laughs. \"They're around in&#xa0;Michael's life in a soap opera sort of way, fodder for amazing stories and anecdotes and hassle and problems.\"</p> <p>Gove's relationship with his parents has always&#xa0;been \"very tender and loving\", another friend says. \"That said, I don't want to sound crude or pompous, but he has a metropolitan London life. There is a gap there.\"</p> <p>But Gove has never looked for his birth mother, and says he never will, out of loyalty to the parents who raised him. \"He is just not a very conflicted person,\" another friend offers simply. \"I don't think there's a great deal of inner turmoil there. He regards life as having smiled on him.\"</p> <p>Gove has always been good-humoured about his place in the party's popularity stakes. In fact, he's so accustomed to coming second as the party faithful's choice of after-dinner speaker, he likes to joke that on his gravestone will be carved the words: \"They Couldn't Get Boris.\" But though Johnson's sense of humour has got him a long way so far, few would bet on him having the last laugh. \"If you had told me Boris Johnson was going to be mayor of London,\" reflects Anthony Goodman, their fellow ex-Oxford union president, \"I definitely would have laughed at you. If you had told me Michael Gove was going to be in government, I would have thought that was pretty obvious.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This footnote was added on 15 October 2012.

  "<p>Friday morning, the <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm\">Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported</a> that the United States added 114,000 new jobs in the month of September and the unemployment rate dropped to 7.8%. </p> <p>The addition of a little over 100,000 jobs would not be enough to move the unemployment rate down from 8.1%, but the 7.8% rate was based partly on a total of 873,000 jobs added. So how is that we have these two jobs figures? And why is it that the 873,000 figure is what is counted for the unemployment rate? </p> <p>The charge from some quarters of the conservative blogosphere is that the figures were being manipulated by the Obama administration to lower the headline unemployment rate? But let's look at the facts.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/ces/\">Current Employment Survey</a> is where we get the 114,000 number of new jobs created. With <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/homch2.htm\">the CES</a>, it's possible that people who already have one job might have gotten a second one. It's a survey of businesses, so we shouldn't expect the businesses to know about what their employees do outside of each firm's work hours. That's why it isn't used for the unemployment rate.</p> <p>The BLS asks businesses to voluntarily take part in the survey. Some businesses will refuse. Either way, it's important to note that not all businesses are included in the survey. Every month, therefore, the survey must be weighted to ensure that the businesses that do submit reports are representative of all businesses. This is done from statistics collected yearly from hard data reported by employees to the government.&#xa0;</p> <p>The problem, of course, is that any survey, no matter how well done, will always have <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/ces/cesregrevtec.htm\">survey error</a>.&#xa0;That's the reason that we have initial reports and then revisions.&#xa0;The errors have two-fold causes. Not all businesses report their data even if they are part of the survey. As more businesses report and more hard data is acquired by the BLS, the bureau gets a better idea of where the true employment figures stand. We also have a yearly revision, as a <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/ces/cesprelbmk.htm\">new benchmark</a> is created when all businesses, regardless of whether they take part in the survey, are required to report their employment statuses to state governments. This can be combined with a <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cessa_oview.htm\">seasonal adjustment</a> to take into account jobs added because of, say, ski resorts in the winter.&#xa0;</p> <p>These errors are typically not large in percentage terms, but the numbers themselves can look large.&#xa0;The 2011 change in the benchmark of +162,000 jobs (spread over the 12-month period) was only a change of +0.1%.&#xa0;For the monthly survey, the margin of error is a seemingly staggering 100,000 jobs at 90% confidence. Put another way, the 114,000 new jobs could actually be 14,000 or 214,000, and either would fall within the margin of error. That's why, when I see an August revision of 96,000 to 141,000 jobs, I don't blink an eye.</p> <p>I also wouldn't be terribly surprised if that 114,000 turned into a net job gain of -1,000 or +230,000 in the months to come. Ninety percent confidence means that 10% of the time, we can expect the first report to fall outside the margin: it'll happen.</p> <p>The other part of the BLS report is the unemployment rate. The unemployment rate is derived from the <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/cps/\">Current Population Survey</a>. As the name implies, this is a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:0ZZQcUThxBcJ:www.bls.gov/cps/eetech_methods.pdf+CPS+explainer+bureau+of+labor&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShGZbkFQmHoGkJn2p2LODRxKXhRdYsk-mUGsDC7vLids43rB--GxdmQPzgQ4qwpNNfhAjHUM4Om1reSvpRJihoq21HRDbcevUcqkDGzelEKK7WViJWP7ticCkSEgLitIBTUu7xA&amp;sig=AHIEtbQR0qwRW6iLJshtfjW9NrMj_kEdPA\">poll of people</a>, not businesses. Every month, 60,000 households or about 110,000 individuals are surveyed. This sample is weighted by geography, urban/rural, and industrial/farm divisions. Additionally, each person in the sample is weighted to account for differences in age, race, sex, Hispanic ethnicity, and state.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/cps/cps_htgm.htm#unemployed\">unemployment rate</a> is determined by the number of people looking for jobs (that is, the people not employed, but in the labor force) according to the CPS. It's very possible to see a drop in the unemployment rate because people stop looking for jobs. We have seen that in past months, but that 's not what happened in September 2012.</p> <p>According to the CPS, the civilian work force jumped by 418,000, with the employment level in September rising by a staggering 873,000 \u2013 the largest gain since January 2003. Meanwhile, the unemployment level dropped by 456,000 during the same period. A seasonal adjustment is then applied to this data to reach an unemployment rate.</p> <p>But how is it possible that the two surveys show such vastly different results in terms of jobs gained?</p> <p>First, the <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2006/02/art2abs.htm\">CPS includes people whom the CES excludes, and vice versa</a>. The CPS includes the self-employed, private household workers (for example, nannies), unpaid family workers (for instance, the 17-year-old son working at the hardware store), and workers on leave. The CES can give a higher jobs report because an employee with two jobs can be counted twice, and because workers under the age of 16 are also included.</p> <p>Second, the CPS has a far higher margin of error. The CPS is only interviewing 110,000 people out of the 240 million people potentially employed: that's about 0.05% of the population it is trying to report on. The margin of error at 90% confidence is +/- 400,000. The CES, by contrast, is interviewing about 410,000 worksites and 140,000 businesses, when there are only about 30 million businesses in the United States.</p> <p>When you take into account the differences in data collection and apply a historical adjustment, the CPS jobs gain is estimated at about 294,000 for September 2012 if adjusted to match CES criteria. That's well within any margin of error.</p> <p>Keep in mind that when we want to talk about the overall unemployment rate, we refer to the CPS because it \"provides a broader picture of employment, including agriculture and the self-employed\". The unemployment rate itself only has a margin of error of +/- 0.2 of a point.</p> <p>But is it possible that all of these numbers are a fraud? Can Obama really be getting at the BLS? That would require one of three things to happen.&#xa0;</p> <p>First, Obama would to have to be in cahoots with businesses across this country to fabricate the number of employees reported all over the US \u2013 including many who <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0712/79007.html\">reportedly didn't like him two months ago</a>. These businesses would also have to change their books if Romney were elected. But why the heck would a business want to promote a president if he was supposedly hurting their bottom line?</p> <p>Second, people would have to be lying in the CPS. Again, this requires that people misreport their status to promote a president who is keeping them out of work. This would also imply that minorities, who typically support Obama in larger numbers, would also misreport their employment status in larger numbers, but we know that, in fact, they suffer the <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/thenextamerica/workforce/jobless-rate-for-minorities-modestly-improving-20121005\">highest rates of unemployment</a>.</p> <p>Third, the BLS itself has been corrupted by the White House. If you think that's plausible, I would suggest you read <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/jobs-day-an-economic-and-political-obsession/2012/03/09/gIQADZPW1R_story.html\">this piece</a> by Eli Saslow from March of this year. The people who are compiling the jobs data are a bunch of dedicated, data-crunching nerds who live inside their own black box. These folks get the data from computers, close the blinds, and talk with no one before the jobs report is fully compiled.&#xa0;</p> <p>There are simply no facts to support the thesis that the BLS data is cooked. Are we just not going to trust a number anymore because we don't like it?</p>",
  "<p>The speech sounded pretty good in the hall. The party audience was enthusiastic. The press pronounced it a success. And now, just as Ed Miliband would have wanted, he and the Labour party have an end-of-conference opinion poll bounce following his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/02/ed-miliband-one-man-nation-editorial\" title=\"\">One Nation pitch</a> in Manchester on Tuesday. The findings in Friday's <a href=\"http://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/6aw937uwlp/YG-Archives-Pol-Sun-results-031012.pdf\" title=\"\">YouGov poll</a> for the Sun were impressive. The poll had Labour on 45% support, 14 points ahead of the Conservatives, with the Lib Dems on 10% (they had a small conference bounce of their own, by the way). Even better for Mr Miliband was the boost <a href=\"http://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/8h6kfbu889/YG-Archives-Pol-Sun-results-121003%20Ed%E2%80%99s%20Speech%20(2).pdf\" title=\"\">to his own ratings</a>. Having previously been a distant speck in David Cameron's rear-view mirror, the Labour leader has suddenly accelerated into a more conspicuous position. He is 12 points up on \"clear what he stands for\", and six points up on \"provides an effective opposition\" and \"up to the job of prime minister\". Mr Cameron is now only four points ahead as best PM.</p> <p>Don't dismiss these findings as irrelevant. There was a time when, provided all went well, parties could expect a poll bounce at the end of their conference week. But that hasn't been true recently. A lot of the time, the conference dividend has been hard to conjure. Probably that's a reflection of a certain convergence among the parties in a recession- and deficit-dominated agenda. It also speaks to continuing post-expenses disdain towards politicians. But it also reflects the fact that not much happens at these stage-managed events either, which means they get less coverage in a diversified media. This year, indeed, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/oct/06/bbc-newsnight-pm\" title=\"\">the BBC has led the way</a> for a significantly scaled-down media presence at all the conferences. For most of this week, the corporation and others have led the news with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/05/april-jones-search-day-five-live\" title=\"\">the April Jones disappearance</a>, not the Labour conference. All in all, it is tougher for politicians to get a message through unless they have something to say and a story to tell.</p> <p>Mr Miliband managed that handsomely on Tuesday, unlike 2011 when he had no discernible bounce, and the good end-of-week polls are his reward. Like Mitt Romney in the US, he has this week broken out of the story in which he has been imprisoned. But Mr Miliband's speech, successful though it was, did not slice through the tangle of issues that have made Labour's position so tricky in the past two years. And it would be a mistake to assume that he has yet fundamentally changed the terms of the party battle. That's partly because that YouGov poll wasn't quite the standout it may seem. Its 45%-31%-10% finding was actually pretty close to the <a href=\"http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/\" title=\"\">recent average scores</a> of 42%-32%-11%. It's also because post-conference polling tends to settle down once the political caravan returns to Westminster. Don't overestimate the degree of public attention either, or the relatively low significance that party politics plays in many people's lives. Remember, too, that Mr Miliband has yet to spell out much of the practical meaning of his speech.</p> <p>Yet there is no disputing that Mr Miliband has achieved one thing. He has made the Conservative conference, which starts in Birmingham on Sunday, a lot more interesting. Mr Cameron already <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/04/david-cameron-ed-miliband-effect\" title=\"\">faced a difficult week</a> because of a stalled economy, setbacks such as the west coast mainline debacle, the Andrew Mitchell outburst (the chief whip has suddenly found he hasn't got time to make the short trip from his <a href=\"http://www.andrew-mitchell-mp.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Sutton Coldfield constituency</a> to the conference) and the destabilising media-fanned challenge from Boris Johnson. Now Mr Cameron also has to contend with a bold and serious challenge on the centre ground from a Labour leader whom the Tory high command was preparing \u2013 and may still be preparing \u2013 to spend the week rubbishing.

  "<p>In the hall of fame of improbable headlines \u2013 think \"Fifty Shades of Grey wins Booker\" \u2013 let's nominate two more: \"Romney crushes Obama\"; and \"British press hails Ed Miliband's presentational skills\". Last weekend, to have dreamed of either eventuality, let alone both, would have sounded utterly delusional. Yet such is the magic of politics, here we are a week later and those dreams have come true. (Not, alas, for EL James, though there's always next year.)</p> <p>Mitt Romney gave Barack Obama <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/04/romney-obama-first-presidential-debate\" title=\"\">such a good hiding in their first TV debate</a>, you half expected the referee to step in and end the bout on compassionate grounds. While the president was lethargic and passive, his talking points lost in a haze of numbers and Beltway detail, Romney fizzed, consistently crisp and direct. An instant poll of viewers gave it to the challenger by <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/03/cnn-poll-romney-wins-debate-by-big-margin/\" title=\"\">67% to 25%</a>, the first candidate to clear 60% since such post-debate surveys began in 1984.</p> <p>Ed Miliband, meanwhile, won near-universal raves for a conference performance that stunned both his audience and a press corps that had come to believe the Labour leader could not perform his way out of a paper bag. Strong in the areas he had been deemed weak \u2013 in delivery and stage presence \u2013 he was showered in Twitter love, even by those Tory commentators who have made a living mocking him as Wallace's dweebier and nerdier twin. I understand that Tony Blair himself sent his successor a \"lovely note\". The amazing truth is that on the day, judged purely on the business of political communication, Miliband was better than Barack Obama. (Make that the week's third unlikely headline.)</p> <p>The result is that the two incumbents on either side of the Atlantic are now on the back foot, under pressure to hit back soon, the demand especially intense from their own supporters. On Wednesday, <a href=\"http://www.conservatives.com/Get_involved/Conference.aspx\" title=\"\">Conservatives expect to see </a>David Cameron remind them why they picked him seven years ago, delivering a conference spectacular that puts Miliband back in his place. Democrats yearn for Obama to mete out a similar pummelling to Romney six days later, at the second of their three head-to-head encounters.</p> <p>The pressure on Obama is more urgent \u2013 Americans vote exactly one month tomorrow \u2013 while Cameron's date with the electorate is not till 2015. But the PM will be watching closely, mindful that occupants of high office in the age of austerity have much in common \u2013 little of it good.</p> <p>Until now, Conservatives have watched Obama push ahead of Romney and comforted themselves that governments can defeat oppositions, even amid the economic gloom, so long as they move early and often to cast the challenger as extreme, unable to grasp the nature of the nation's core problem and drawn from the party that created that problem in the first place. What Obama had done to Romney, Cameron would do to Miliband. Throw in a charisma advantage over the challenger \u2013 who could be painted as stiff, wooden and a little weird \u2013 along with a plea for understanding from the electorate that results take time, and Obama seemed to have drawn a roadmap that could lead fellow incumbents, in Britain and beyond, to victory.</p> <p>The Denver debate has shaken that complacency. For it showed that those tactics alone are not enough. A politician in power who wants to stay in power has to have what political operatives call a \"forward offer\". He can't simply trash his rival or defend his record. He has to talk about the future, about what he will do next.</p> <p>This, rather than his infuriating, head-down failure to make eye contact with either the camera or his opponent, was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/03/obama-romney-first-debate-live\" title=\"\">what undid Obama on Wednesday night</a>. He was raking over the events of the last four years, not sketching a vision of the next four. In this he was forgetting a lesson he had already learned. A year ago, Obama's message was that he had made a good start in getting \"the car out of the ditch\" and that he ought to be allowed to finish the job. Too backward-looking, says US pollster Stan Greenberg, onetime adviser to Bill Clinton and now helping Miliband. In a Manchester cafe thronging with Labour delegates this week, he told me that if the president had persisted with that theme, \"he'd have lost\". Fortunately Obama shifted, focusing instead on his plan for the future. As soon as he did, the numbers moved his way.</p> <p>Cameron has to make the same move, starting on Sunday in Birmingham. He has to explain what the country will look like, once we emerge from the current economic trauma. Leaders always need to explain where they are leading, but that's doubly true in recession. Margaret Thatcher remained on top even during the hard times because she told the nation a story about why the medicine was painful and how much healthier we'd be once we'd swallowed it. People can endure all kinds of hardship if they know and accept why they're doing it. For all his oratorical skills, Obama has not constructed a similarly compelling narrative and nor has Cameron.</p> <p>But it's harder for the PM. For one thing, there's the question of motive. One luminary of the right sighs that while voters often accuse parties of the centre-left of being \"weak\", they never think of them as \"evil\": \"They assume their heart is in the right place.\" Even among those Americans who don't rate Obama, most believe he means well. The Conservatives enjoy no such starting assumption of benign intent (though Cameron himself once did).</p> <p>Second, Cameron arrives in Birmingham on the defensive because Miliband has just placed his tanks on the Tory lawn, claiming for Labour the Disraelian mantle of one nation. \"Cameron cannot afford to concede that ground,\" says one former Tory strategist. \"He must contest it, contest it, contest it.\" In both Britain and the US, and this is surely what Labour has learned watching Obama, whoever can speak most convincingly for the many, not the few, whoever can own \"we're all in this together\" \u2013 to use two recent formulations of the same idea \u2013 will prevail. Which is why <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/27/obama-campaign-fresh-attack-romney\" title=\"\">Romney's writing off of 47% of Americans</a> was so disastrous \u2013 and why it is astonishing Obama did not mention it in Denver.</p> <p>The president can turn things around with one good debate performance. Today he <a href=\"http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/10/economy-adds-tk-jobs-in-september.php?ref=fpa\" title=\"\">received a handy boost</a>, as unemployment fell below the electorally critical 8% threshold for the first time since he took office in January 2009. Obama remains a blessedly lucky candidate. For Cameron, it will not be so easy.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/j_freedland\" title=\"\"><em>@j_freedland</em></a></p>",

As Fehrnstrom famously put it back in March: \"You can kind of shake it up and restart all over again.\"</p> <p>In the first presidential TV debate with President Obama on Wednesday night, and in subsequent media appearances, the former governor of Massachusetts has made several sharp changes in tack that have left seasoned Romney observers flabbergasted. The most dramatic was on Thursday night, when during an interview on Fox News he completely denounced his own notorious comments in a private fundraiser that 47% of the American people were dependent on government.</p> <p>In the firestorm that followed <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/secret-video-romney-private-fundraiser\">Mother Jones's publication of the remarks</a>, Romney tried to stand by them, saying they were correct albeit inelegantly put. But on Thursday night he ditched them entirely, saying: \"In this case, I said something that's just completely wrong.\"</p> <p>The U-turn was in the spirit of his performance in the previous night's presidential debate, in which he displayed similarly breathtaking revisions to policy positions that he has been projecting on the campaign trail for at least 18 months.</p> <p>On tax, having spent the entire Republican primary season trying to convince the fiscally conservative Tea Party that he could be trusted to cut taxes for all Americans including the super-rich, he said: \"I'm not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people [who are] doing just fine.\"</p> <p>Having spent months attacking government red tape for cramping the creativity of the free market, he announced that he now believed that: \"Regulation is essential. You can't have a free market work if you don't have regulation.\"</p> <p>And having tub-thumped consistently on the campaign trail against Obamacare, he attempted to embrace the most popular aspects of the Affordable Health Care Act. \"I do have a plan that deals with people with pre-existing conditions,\" he said, referring to the provision in the legislation that prevents insurance companies rejecting such patients.</p> <p>He even praised his own healthcare reforms in Massachusetts as a \"model for the nation, state by state\". In the past, Romney has tended to avoid talking about his healthcare record as governor because it is seen by many arch conservatives as evidence of his closet liberal tendencies.</p> <p>Obama has been criticised by pundits of both left and right for failing to point out his opponent's nimble footwork on Wednesday night. But he's been trying to make up for the omission in speeches delivered since. At a rally in Fairfax Virginia on Friday morning, Obama accused Romney of \"trying to do a two-step, to have an extreme makeover\".</p> <p>Political observers have reacted to Romney's energetic shift to the centre with surprise; not that he has made the move in itself, but that he has made it so late in the election cycle. The political analyst Larry Sabato said: \"Romney has completely ignored until now Richard Nixon's advice \u2013 go right for the primary season and then scramble back to the middle for the general election. He is only now scrambling back.\"</p> <p>Michael Wissot, a senior strategist with Luntz Global, who advised John McCain in his presidential run against Obama in 2008, said: \"I am very surprised that this strategy has been put into place so late. As governor he had a very strong record of bi-partisanship in Massachusetts where he courted Democrats to achieve results.\"</p> <p>One explanation for the time delay between Fehrnstrom's hailing of Romney the Etch A Sketch six months ago and the emergence of such a candidate just four weeks before election day has been his persistent difficulties with his own Republican base. He has struggled to convince rightwing conservatives who hold sway at many levels of the party that he can be trusted to carry their convictions into the White House should he win on 6 November.</p> <p>But there are signs that following his confident and assertive performance at the first debate, the doubters are finally coming on board. William Kristol, editor of the rightwing Weekly Standard and a long-time critic of Romney, <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/podcast-kristol-reacts-first-presidential-debate_653619.html\">conceded after the debate</a> that there was a need for him to be \"somewhat reassuring about what he would do as president, which is important for independent swing voters who are not 100% behind the conservative agenda\".</p> <p>That other thorn in Romney's side, Rush Limbaugh, gushed that \"this was one of the best debate performances in my life\". Erik Erickson, editor of the blog Red State, tweeted the day after the debate: \"Mitt Romney may be an Etch a Sketch, but it beats the hell out of Obama's whack-a-mole from last night.\"</p>",
  "<p>The coalition government is precarious. It has slender claim to democratic legitimacy. Yet, somehow, it has been accepted as an immovable part of the&#xa0;political landscape, something the UK is stuck with until a&#xa0;general election trundles around, under the coalition's own Fixed Term Parliament Act. Labour, despite its warnings about the damage being wreaked by an incompetent and feckless administration, seems happy to bide its time. Of course, this makes sense in party terms \u2013 plenty of time to prepare and raise election cash, plenty of time for the Lib Dems to destroy themselves and for the Conservatives to lose the \"economic credibility\" on which their ideological gamble is based. But, God, how I wish Labour had the courage and&#xa0;confidence to act out of immediate conviction, not long-term political advantage, and call the coalition's bluff.</p> <p>To win a vote of no confidence against this \"incompetent, out-of-touch, U-turning, make-it-up-as-you-go-along, miserable shower\", the Labour leadership would obviously have to throw a lifeline to the Liberal Democrats. This would be anathema to&#xa0;many tribal Labour members and supporters, who now hate the Lib Dems more than they do the Tories.</p> <p>But this is not sensible. It leaves the Lib Dems with no alternative but to cling to the Conservatives, unable to exercise any ameliorative influence at all, because they are trapped, and the Tories know it. The Conservatives have no need to appease the Lib Dems any longer. They understand perfectly well that without help from Labour, the Lib&#xa0;Dems can only bring down the coalition in a blazing act of annihilating martyrdom. And they know that Labour are not going to provide that help.</p> <p>But it's nice to dream. Certainly, it would not be difficult for the Lib Dems to come up with some good reasons for withdrawing from the coalition, marginalised and manipulated as they have been. Even they must see their reasons for leaving would be stronger than their reasons for staying, which look thinner and more strained by the day. Everyone, surely, understands that the main Lib Dem reason for staying is now simple fear \u2013 fear of facing the consequences of their uncomfortable situation under a leader who many of them feel has been naive, foolish, reckless and vain, and fear that with the end of the coalition comes also the end of the Lib Dems.</p> <p>But what if that fear was assuaged, just a bit? It would be simple for Labour and the Lib Dems to mount a successful no-confidence vote against the government, with the understanding that Labour and the Lib Dems would not&#xa0;stand against each other in certain key seats (though not the seats of their respective leaders), and that there would be a place at the cabinet table for&#xa0;a few of them. Surely it's got to be better than another couple of years of blustering Cameron and smirking Osborne, amassing donations as they carve up state services among their wealthy supporters, making a mockery of the tiny bit of a democratic voice that the electorate in this country gets?</p> <p>In truth, Labour isn't in that much of&#xa0;a hurry, isn't that bold, or principled, or prepared. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/02/ed-miliband-one-nation-speech?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Ed Miliband's One Nation speech</a> earlier this week? Lauded as it may have been, I'm still appalled by it. Far from being a call to arms, it was a call to complacency \u2013 and one that was enthusiastically answered. It is utterly ridiculous to lavish praise on a putative national leader simply because he is able to relax before a sympathetic audience and waffle on about National Unity and&#xa0;Me without notes.</p> <p>Frankly, if he'd needed notes to deliver that lot, it would have been considerably more surprising. If that marked Miliband out as a Great Leader, then Stewart Lee should be president of the planet. Neither Labour nor the media listened to that speech and thought: \"This man should be in charge right now. This is urgent.\" On the contrary, his supporters seemed relieved that there was plenty of time for him \u2013 and them \u2013 to work out how One Nation could be practically applied in the context of an international economy in crisis. Except that there isn't actually enough time, and there never will be. You could spend for ever trying to translate that lot into workable policy, and still draw a blank.</p> <p>It's not a time for Britain to indulge itself in exceptionalist fantasies. This is a time for this country to look around, and grasp that nearly every other European country \u2013 and the US \u2013 is&#xa0;in the same situation as the UK. This is&#xa0;no national crisis, with national solutions. It is a global crisis, and Miliband's failure to mention Europe, let&#xa0;alone the rest of the world, suggests that he is nowhere near facing that, let&#xa0;alone addressing it.</p> <p>Britain is by no means the only country that is finding it hard to provide employment for its population. The coalition is not the only government imposing cuts in response to the crisis. If Labour and Miliband really do feel that they have a plausible alternative to austerity, one that they truly believe in, then it is staggeringly irresponsible for them to be keeping it to themselves. Even if they feel confident that they can&#xa0;manage the cuts better, then they should be concentrating forensically on&#xa0;making that case, right now. On the contrary, Miliband has barely been seen in recent weeks. It's a fair bet that an awful lot of time and energy has been lavished on practising that speech.</p> <p>In truth, Miliband's fantasy is not so&#xa0;different to Cameron's. Both parties invert the relationship between work and welfare. Cameron believes that if you remove state support, then jobs will come. Miliband believes that if you get state support just right, as in the story of&#xa0;Goldilocks, then jobs will come. In&#xa0;truth, state support is necessary precisely because our economy \u2013 the number of jobs available, and the range of salaries attached to them \u2013 does not&#xa0;accurately address or match the capabilities and needs of the population. As emerging economies continue to advance, this miserably divisive situation is likely to intensify.</p> <p>What's really happening is that the economies that industrialised first are in&#xa0;the throes of a huge and painful transition, in which they can only maintain their own standard of living by purchasing goods created by people whose standard of living isn't so high. Problem? The customers are here, but the jobs are&#xa0;elsewhere. And of the jobs that are here, many have to compete with the wages that \"elsewhere\" will accept.</p> <p>Looked at this way, welfare can finally be seen for what it is \u2013 a mechanism that nurtures good customers every bit as much as it nurtures good workers. That,&#xa0;quite simply, is the economic and&#xa0;philosophical change that western governments are going to have to learn how to manage. They need to start by accepting the reality of the state that the world, not just this One Nation, is in.</p>",
  "<p>With more than 50,000 US-born Latinos coming of voting age every month, Hispanic political power is fueled by youth. Especially here in swing-state Colorado, where November's presidential outcome is up for grabs.</p> <p>Nearly half of Colorado's Latino electorate falls in the 18-to-34 age group, and tapping into the rising power of Latino youth presents both a rich opportunity and a daunting challenge to Democrats, particularly here in the blue-collar city of Pueblo.</p> <p>Apathy runs deep and immigration politics don't play big here because border policies do not directly affect the lives of well over 90% of the local Latino population who were born in America and are thus native US citizens.</p> <p>Half of Pueblo's 106,595 residents are Hispanic, and this demographic should be ripe for Obama's re-election campaign to target. Yet, the political energy among Latino youth has ebbed since its highwater mark four years ago, professors and students at Colorado State University-Pueblo say.</p> <p>\"I don't think that we're very political,\" said Fawn Amber Montoya, the director of the Chicano studies program at CSU-Pueblo, after a long sigh. \"Pueblo really is dead when it comes to politics.\"</p> <p>No one doubts that Obama will, again, win Pueblo County as he did in 2008 with a crushing margin of 15 percentage points. But the question that could spell trouble for the Obama campaign is: how much political energy will the Obama re-election campaign garner from voters in this historic steel-mill city?</p> <p>Obama campaigned here twice in 2008, winning the state's nine electoral votes with a 9 percentage-point lead over John McCain. But there is a demographic deficit within the Latino community. Though it makes up a half of the overall population, it forms just a third of the 71,552 registered to vote in the town.</p> <p>Statewide, Hispanics make up about one-fifth of the population, and more than 434,000 Hispanics are eligible to vote, said Sindy Benavides of Voto Latino, a non-partisan organization that focuses on Latino civic engagement.</p> <p>The Latino population grew at more than twice Colorado's overall growth rate over the past decade. That trend is reflected nationwide, with the Latino youth representing the fastest-growing demographic in the US. More than 17 million Latinos under the age of 18 live in America, according to 2010 Census data, and there are more than 14.5 million young Hispanic eligible voters aged 18 to 34.</p> <p>In Colorado, there are 295,707 Hispanics between 18 and 34, the age group that Benavides's organization heavily targets. They make up 68% of eligible Hispanic voters in Colorado. Nationwide, 52,000 Hispanics turn 18 each month, and nine out of 10 of them are eligible to vote, Benavides said.</p> <p>\"When you start looking at that number, and you start looking at local state races, and even federal races, and how close some of them have been, then you start seeing why that impact is so great,\" Benavides said.</p> <p>Little wonder, then, that an Obama campaign office re-opened this February, early in the campaign cycle, in Pueblo's downtown, and that in June, Michelle Obama rallied about 1,000 people at the Colorado State Fairgrounds in Pueblo.</p> <p>Among Pueblo's population, only 3.8% are foreign-born, far less than the state's 9.8%. Most Latinos here date back here for generations. But many students at the CSU-Pueblo campus are, in fact, first-generation Americans.</p> <p>One such student is Perla Ontiveros, 21, who will be a first-time voter in the presidential election. She was formerly the president of the Mexican American student group on campus known as Mecha, Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztl\u00e1n, which promotes higher education and Latino cultural awareness.</p> <p>She and other Mecha members echoed Montoya's thought that Pueblo is far from buzzing with political energy. When asked if students are politically active on campus, Jeff Bazanele, 23, who graduated in May, said without hesitation, \"No. Absolutely not.\"</p> <p>\"Sometimes I refer to my students as being apolitical,\" said Dave Marquez, a CSU-Pueblo professor of Chicano Studies who is a Pueblo native and an activist from the Chicano movement. He and his wife were also Obama volunteers in 2008.</p> <p>Marquez's face glowed as he reminisced on the faded political energy of the 1970s he says is now missing from Hispanic youth in Pueblo.</p> <p>The most recent example he remembers of student political activism was seven years ago, when students mobilized against a professor who was said to be using class time for anti-immigration rants.</p> <p>\"That was the one time on campus when a lot of the apathy that would discourage me sometimes \u2026 we were able to eliminate that and get the whole campus motivated,\" Marquez said.</p> <p>But more recently, the Mecha students said they were \"fired up\" about a bill which a state senator from Pueblo sponsored that would create a more affordable tuition rate for undocumented students, a sort of modified version of the controversial Dream Act. In April, the bill was rejected for the sixth time by Republicans, who hold a one-seat majority in the Colorado assembly.</p> <p>One student who would have benefited from that bill is Diomara Balbuena, 17, of Pueblo. Balbuena, who is a few days shy of voting age, is not a legal citizen nor a legal resident of the US, since her parents brought her from Mexico as a child. She only realised the implications for her during her freshman year of high school.</p> <p>In a major immigration policy shift on June 15, Obama announced that young undocumented people, like Balbuena, would no longer be deported and could apply for work permits, if they met certain requirements \u2013&#xa0;but citizenship would remain out of reach.</p> <p>Because this news is so recent, Balbuena said she didn't apply to college when all her other friends did, even though she graduated high school with good grades. But with Obama's rule change, she now plans to apply for a work permit and a college place. \"It makes me really happy. Finally, we're getting our voices heard,\" Balbuena said after hearing the news. \"It's an unexplainable emotion \u2026&#xa0;to know we're not being left alone.\"</p> <p>While Balbuena is an example of a motivated young Hispanic who otherwise would turn out to vote for Obama, she's essentially left without a voice or a vote; but her three younger siblings, all born in the US, will eventually be able to vote, as will many of her fellow Latino friends.</p> <p>Obama's bold move on immigration resonated deeply among Latinos in and outside of Colorado. Whatever his motivation, the move was certainly good politics as an election-year ploy to win the crucial Latino vote.</p> <p>\"I think it's a first step, so I do applaud the president,\" said senator Angela Giron, a Democrat, who sponsored the immigrant tuition rate bill.</p> <p>\"He [Obama] is earning the Latino vote,\" said congressman Dan Pabon, a Democrat from north-west Colorado. \"I don't think the president can do much more than he's doing.

  "<p>Polling \u2013 or perhaps more importantly, the abuse of polling data \u2013 has a checkered history in Venezuela. I will never forget the day of the presidential recall referendum in 2004. I was sitting in the BBC studio in Washington, between a TV and radio interview, and the fax machine spat out a release from what was then one of the most influential Democratic polling and consulting firms in the United States: Penn, Schoen, Berland and Associates.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/penn_shoen_berland_release.pdf\">\"Exit Poll Results Show Major Defeat for Chavez\"</a> was the headline. The agency claimed to have interviewed an enormous sample (more than 20,000 voters at 267 voting centers), and found that Ch\u00e1vez had been voted out of office by a margin of 59% to 41%.</p> <p>I looked up at the producer who gave me the fax with more than a bit of perplexity. With good reason: the actual result of the referendum was the opposite: 58% to 41% against the recall. The Organization of American States and the Carter Center observed the election and made it clear that there was no doubt that the results were clean. Given the actual vote, the <a href=\"http://www.cepr.net/index.php/reports/polling-and-the-ballot-the-venezuelan-referendum/\">probability of the variation in PSB's result</a> was less than 1 chance in 10 to the 490th power, if you can imagine something that unlikely.</p> <p>The producer put the press release aside. \"I'm not doing anything with this unless there's another source,\" she said.</p> <p>Which brings us to the current presidential election on Sunday. The <a href=\"http://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/7311\">most recent polls show a wide range</a> of possibilities, from a 4% lead for President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's challenger, Henrique Capriles, to a 27.7% lead for Ch\u00e1vez himself. The average is a lead of 11.7 points for Ch\u00e1vez over Capriles.</p> <p>My <a href=\"http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/adjusting-for-polling-biases-in-venezuelas-2012-presidential-election\">CEPR colleague David Rosnick did a statistical analysis</a> of the most recent polling data to adjust for the biases of the various polling firms, using data from 2004-2012. The adjusted lead increases to 13.7 percentage points, with Capriles having an estimated 5.7% chance of winning the election.</p> <p>Nevertheless, <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2012/09/30/capriles-chavez-rally-venezuela/1604591/\">much of the US media</a> is making it look like a close race, in spite of the polling data. It's not as bad as 2004, when most of the major foreign media were pretending \u2013 ridiculously, as it turned out \u2013 that the recall referendum was <a href=\"http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/venezuela_2004_08.pdf\">\"too close to call\"</a>. There is progress in history.</p> <p>Also, this time, some reporters and analysts who are trying to report more accurately for investors \u2013 the Venezuelan bond market has shown some \"irrational exuberance\" lately on the hope of a Capriles victory \u2013 are saying that Ch\u00e1vez will likely win.</p> <p>More gravely, though, the Venezuelan opposition in past elections has always had a \"plan B\", which is to claim fraud if they lose and to bring people into the streets. We saw this in 2004: there was even <a href=\"http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/black-swans-conspiracy-theories-and-the-quixotic-search-for-fraud/\">some academic research</a> that \u2013 with help of conspiracy theories that made the 9/11 fantasies of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_Change_(film_series)\">Loose Change</a> look reasonable by comparison \u2013 claimed to find statistical evidence that the election was stolen. The Carter Center had to set up <a href=\"http://www.cartercenter.org/news/documents/doc2023.html\">an independent panel of academic statisticians</a> to look at this statistical \"evidence\", and <a href=\"http://www.cartercenter.org/documents/2020.pdf\">they found it to be nonexistent (pdf)</a>.</p> <p>But these allegations had a significant impact in Venezuela \u2013 where the opposition boycotted the 2005 congressional elections on the grounds that the 2004 referendum had been \"rigged\". Much of the Latin American press also ran with the conspiracy theories.</p> <p>What about Sunday's election? Ch\u00e1vez made his usual statement that he would accept the results, no matter what; <a href=\"http://hayuncamino.com/comando-venezuela/lopez-comando-venezuela-al-100-para-asegurar-votos/\">Capriles has been less committal</a>. One of the best things the electoral authorities have going for them is that the Obama administration \u2013 like the Bush administration in 2004 \u2013 doesn't want any trouble that could raise the price of gasoline before the US presidential election. And Capriles and most of his allies would be unlikely to mount an organized effort to dispute the results with Washington recognizing them.</p> <p>Putting their elections right before ours in the US was one of the smartest things that the Venezuelan government could have done to ensure the integrity of their electoral process. But there are elements of the opposition that are already saying that Capriles must win and that there will be violence in the streets if the election is \"stolen\". So \"plan B\" actions are still possible.</p> <p>The polling story from 2004 has a happy ending. In 2006, PSB produced some pre-election polls that nobody could believe (Ch\u00e1vez ended up winning with <a href=\"http://www.cne.gob.ve/divulgacionPresidencial/resultado_nacional.php\">62.8% of the vote</a>). So <a href=\"http://espanol.groups.yahoo.com/group/UPLA-VEN_USA/message/6255\">Mark Penn replaced pollster Doug Schoen</a>. Penn went on to be Hillary Clinton's chief strategist in her 2008 presidential bid, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/09/the-hillary-clinton-memos/306951/\">offering insights</a> on how to go after the \"unelectable\" Obama for his \"lack of American roots\". Penn was forced to resign as chief strategist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/07/hillaryclinton\">when it was discovered that he was helping the Colombian government lobby</a> for a \"free trade\" agreement with the US.</p> <p>Doug Schoen, meanwhile, has just published a new book about the \"crisis in American politics\". It's called <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Hopelessly-Divided-Crisis-American-Politics/dp/1442215232\">Hopelessly Divided</a>, and it has glowing endorsements from such luminaries as Michael Bloomberg and Bob Shrum. I hope they checked the polling data the author is using.</p> <p>Is this a great country or what? No matter how badly you mess up, there's always another chance. Well, at least for some people.</p>",
  "<p>Across America an electoral giant is stirring. The country's growing Latino population \u2013 projected to be almost a third of the US population by 2050 \u2013 is changing the demographic face of the nation, with potentially huge political consequences.</p> <p>Since 1986 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/01/latino-voter-eligibility-all-time-high\">it has more than tripled</a> from 7.5 million to 23.7 million this year.</p> <p>Several of the key battleground states that are likely to determine the result of the presidential election on 6 November have large Hispanic populations. In Florida, the quintessential swing state, there are 2.1million eligible Latino voters, one in six of the electorate.</p> <p>That's comfortably enough to sway the result in a state which Barack Obama won in 2008 by fewer than 250,000 votes over John McCain.</p> <p>Colorado, another key battleground state this year, has <a href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/category/election-fact-sheets/2010/\">one in eight eligible voters</a>, or 13%, who are Latino. Nevada has 224,000 eligible Hispanic voters, about 100,000 more than the margin by which Obama won the state last time.</p> <p>Despite the steadily rising strength of the American Latino community, it remains a relatively poorly understood and unrealised electoral force. What motivates Hispanic adults to back one candidate and not the other, or even vote at all?</p> <p>How are they responding to the increasingly hostile noises coming from the American right about the need to remove undocumented immigrants from the country? In what ways are young Hispanics, who themselves form a growing segment within this growing demographic, making use of their burgeoning power?</p> <p>To answer some of these questions, the Guardian teamed up with the <a href=\"http://annenberg.usc.edu/\">Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism</a> at the University of Southern California. Seven journalism students, directed by USC professors Marc Cooper and Alan Mittelstaedt, collaborated with the Guardian in a project to explore the sleeping giant of the Latino electorate.</p> <p>With funding help from <a href=\"http://news21.com/\">News21</a>, the journalism education project of the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the John S and James L Knift Foundation, the students fanned out across America to towns and cities selected in tandem with the Guardian. The towns \u2013 in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Pennsylvania, Texas and Washington state \u2013 all have one thing in common: an Hispanic population that is approaching or has already surpassed the majority 50% mark rendering these places \"majority-minority\" arbiters of the future of the US.</p> <p>The students' dispatches provide a fascinating snapshot of the American Latino population as we approach the November presidential election. The first thing that leaps out of them is the diversity of their communities.</p> <p>Contrary to the reductive uniformity imposed on Hispanics in much of the political debate, there is vast range depicted here. There are the established communities of San Antonio, Texas, and Pueblo, Colorado, where most of the Latinos have for generations enjoyed full US citizenship; in contrast to the more transient communities in Washington state.</p> <p>Some of the populations are largely Puerto Rican, as in Poinciana in central Florida; others overwhelmingly of Mexican descent as in Arizona and California. There are the apple- and grape-pickers of Washington state; the mushroom pickers and industrial workers of Pennsylvania; and the (now all-too often unemployed) tourism service workers in Florida.</p> <p>Such diversity apart, the political lesson that leaps out of so many of the reports is that the sleeping giant of the Latino voter remains just that \u2013 sleeping. Turnout at elections remains dismally low. Nationally, fewer than a third of Latino eligible voters cast their ballots in 2010 <a href=\" http://www.pewhispanic.org/2011/04/26/the-latino-electorate-in-2010-more-voters-more-non-voters/\">compared with almost half of whites</a> and 44% of black Americans.</p> <p>In Poinciana, Florida \u2013 a key electoral target in a key electoral state \u2013 Puerto Rican turnout is a miserable 17% compared with 80% in their country of origin.</p> <p>The report from Washington state makes the most depressing reading. In the fruit-picking haven of Yakima Valley in the south of the state, levels of representation for Latinos are reminiscent of the political invisibility that African Americans used to endure in the segregated deep south.</p> <p>The dispatches point to a regressive pattern of disenfranchisement of American Latinos. Because they tend to vote so anaemically, politicians tend to ignore them as an electoral force that merits wooing; because they are ignored they cannot see the point of turning out to vote.</p> <p>As Rick Palacio, chairman of Colorado's Democratic party and a sixth-generation Latino Coloradan, puts it: \"There is some apathy among eligible voters \u2013 people don't quite get the benefits to them of participating in our democracy.\"</p> <p>The economic hardship being felt by Hispanic communities more keenly than most American demographic groups merely heightens that circular pattern of disenfranchisement. It is no coincidence that most of our student reporters found themselves on the poorer side of town \u2013 amid neighborhoods vacated during the foreclosure crisis in Florida, or in a Pennsylvania rustbelt town where manufacturing has collapsed \u2013 because that is where most Hispanics live.</p> <p>Unemployment and the need for job creation runs through all the dispatches as a primary preoccupation. So too does scepticism that politicians of either party will provide meaningful answers. And so the sleeping giant slumbers on.</p> <p>And yet, there are signs of stirring. In Arizona, the people of the small town of Guadaulpe found their response \u2013 and as a result their political voice \u2013 to the heavy-handed police sweeps waged against their community by America's notorious \"toughest sheriff\" Joe Arpaio.</p> <p>On the night of one of his raids, the mayor Rebecca Jiminez stood up to Arpaio and told him she didn't want him or his \"posse\" to come back to the town. He was furious, but never did come back.</p> <p>In Arizona, such resistance has spilled over into political outcomes. Most symbolically, Russell Pearce, the leader of the Republicans in the state Senate who was the architect of the infamous crackdown on undocumented immigrants, SB 1070, was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/09/arizona-recall-latino-election-2012\">voted out of office</a>.</p> <p>Those seeds of change have been noted by politicians on both sides. Obama's re-election campaign opened an office in Pueblo, Colorado, in February, and has been intensely registering and courting Hispanic voters ever since.</p> <p>Polling data suggests that if Obama puts in the effort and gets his message across, he could persuade Latinos to push aside their doubts and cast their votes. In 2008, he won 67% Latino support and there is evidence that his decision to grant undocumented young Latinos a <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/18/obama-immigration-latino-voters-2012-election\">two-year respite from threat</a> of deportation is having a positive impact.</p> <p>There are also signs of the Republicans reflecting on their positions. In Santa Ana, California, a new brand of conservatism is emerging from elements of the Republican party. This strategy eschews the tough talk of \"attrition through enforcement\" and \"self-deportation\" that has epitomised much of the conservative discourse on immigration including that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmrr6NGiA7M\">coming from the mouth of the presidential nominee Mitt Romney</a>.</p> <p>Instead, the new approach talks about guest worker programmes and providing temporary work permits that would allow undocumented immigrants a way out of illegality.</p> <p>Whether or not such new thinking continues to develop within both main parties will depend largely on the final theme that emerges strongly from the student dispatches: the question of youth. If the sleeping giant ever wakes up, it will be the young voters who kick it out of bed.</p> <p>Every year about 600,000 American Latinos, with full voting rights, turn 18. Couple that with the fact that more than a third of the nationwide Hispanic population is under 18, and this transcends into a electoral time bomb.</p> <p>Will young Latinos sieze the day, or allow apathy to continue to dissipate their power? The seven dispatches presented here from the changing face of America provide a few clues to that increasingly urgent question.</p>",
  "<p>Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has survived many crises during his seven years in office, both at home and abroad. But fears over the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/03/iran-currency-crisis-tehran-clashes\" title=\"\">country's crumbling economy</a>, which have exposed the extent of internal divisions at the top of the Islamic republic, could signal the beginning of the end.</p> <p>Ahmadinejad has been left increasingly marginalised as the country's currency has plummeted, with analysts speculating that he is being used by his former allies as a scapegoat for the regime's problems.</p> <p>With the rial reaching an all-time low this week, Ahmadinejad has been roundly rebuffed by his opponents, who blame his government for mismanagement and economic incompetence. The currency has lost a third of its value in a week, with the dollar now three times stronger against it than early last year.</p> <p>At a press conference in Tehran this week, Ahmadinejad made a speech which highlighted the power struggle between his supporters and his conservative rivals in the parliament and the judiciary.</p> <p>The president defended his economic policies and blamed the plummeting value of the rial both on western sanctions and a \"propaganda campaign\" perpetrated by his opponents at home.</p> <p>Ahmadinejad's words widened the internal rift, prompting many of his parliamentary rivals \u2013 who form an overwhelming majority \u2013 to launch the strongest attack on him by regime insiders so far.</p> <p>Abbas Rajaei, an MP for the central city of Arak, accused the president of \"lying vividly to the people\", and Kamalodin Pirmoazen, another parliamentarian, said he was inciting discontent among Iranians towards their officials. The influential MP Ali Motahari, an outspoken critic of Ahmadinejad, has also recently said that the president should not remain in presidential office \"even for another single day\".</p> <p>These remarks echoed what the Iranian opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi, both currently under house arrest, said in 2009 when Ahmadinejad took office for a second term amid unrest and allegations of fraud.</p> <p>They are the latest signs that Ahmadinejad, who has suffered a series of setbacks in his ongoing feud with the conservatives, has lost a great deal of his influence in the country \u2013 although he is still able to grab headlines abroad. Last week, while he was addressing the UN general assembly, his media adviser, Ali Akbar Javanfekr, was taken to Tehran's Evin prison. Ahmadinejad suggested this week that he wanted to inspect the prison, but authorities signalled that he would not be welcome.</p> <p>It did not help that Tehran's Grand Bazaar, the heartbeat of the capital's economy, also went on strike and hundreds of protesters took to the streets, chanting anti-government slogans that described the president as a traitor\". Iranian state TV, which rarely reflects public anger about the regime, reported the closure of the bazaar and the discontent about the devaluation of currency. Analysts saw it as a sign that pressure is mounting on the president.</p> <p>Sadegh Zibakalam, a professor of political science at Tehran University, said Ahmadinejad was increasingly becoming a \"lame duck\". Zibakalam said Ahmadinejad was being used as a scapegoat by many of the same people who were his supporters in the past.</p> <p>\"Ahmadinejad's economic policies are not new. They have been in place from the beginning. If there's a failure, it's not limited to Ahmadinejad. The leadership of fundamentalists should be held responsible too.\"</p> <p>Fundamentalists, who are believed to be close to the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have accused Ahmadinejad and his allies, including his controversial chief of staff, Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, of attempting to undermine clerical power and advocating nationalism and greater cultural openness.</p> <p>\"Ahmadinejad and Mashaei don't think they need to obey clerical power. They both have not been loyal enough to the supreme leader,\" said Zibakalam. He predicted that Ahmadinejad, who cannot run for a third time under Iranian law, would not be able to ensure the election of one of his allies in the 2013 vote.</p> <p>Hamid Dabashi, a professor of Iranian studies at Columbia University, said that some of the slogans used by protesters this week showed that the crisis was \"much more deep-rooted\" and had wider political implications.</p> <p>\"Now the endemic factionalism [in Iran] will try to ride on this crisis, as the Islamic Republic is gearing up for the next presidential election. The conservatives will happily blame Ahmadinejad for everything,\" he said. \"And if [the former president Mohammad] Khatami plays his historic role of warming up the otherwise depleted political energy of the Islamic Republic, they may actually manage to regenerate some political legitimacy for the ruling regime.\"</p>",
  "<p>After Wednesday's presidential debate fiasco, the Obama campaign was desperately looking for some good news. And Friday morning, they got some very good news indeed from the labor department's September jobs report. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2012/oct/05/us-jobs-report-politics-live\">According to this</a>, the economy added 114,000 non-farm private sector jobs, as the unemployment rate fell from 8.1% in August to 7.8% in September. Finally, the Obama administration can say that after 43 straight months of unemployment above 8%, it has now fallen below that psychological threshold.</p> <p>Another good sign was that the labor force participation rate for September edged up, indicating that more people are looking for work. Moreover, the labor department adjusted its August jobs report, adding approximately more 50,000 jobs to its original number.</p> <p>Economically, it was a solid report, but not a blow-out. The economy has slowed markedly since the spring of 2011, when 264,000 jobs were added in April 2011. Friday's number was less than the 139,000 average monthly addition over the first eight months of this year. And it was still far short of the approximately 150,000 jobs per that must be created monthly in order to keep up with the growth rate of the labor force.</p> <p>Yet, consistent improvement in the economy may, indeed, be taking hold: on Wednesday, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) announced that its service index, which measures growth in the services sector, climbed to 55.1% in September, from 53.7% in August. A number over 50% indicates that more service businesses are expanding rather than contracting. This was the best reading in six months, marking the 33rd straight month of expansion and driven by the highest level of new orders since March. Earlier this week also, the ISM manufacturing index, which measures growth in the manufacturing sector, came in at 51.1% for September, the first positive reading in four months.</p> <p>In addition, consumer confidence grew for the sixth straight week, the longest stretch since 2006. Undoubtedly, this has been aided by a jump in the number of mortgage refinances, which jumped 20% last week, to the highest level since 2009. The average rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage fell to 3.53 %, a new low.</p> <p>Despite these glad tidings from its survey participants, though, the ISM also announced that their hiring intentions for the future had fallen. And this is the crux of the problem for the economy, as well as for the Obama administration: with the recovery dragging, employers are reluctant to hire; and with poor job prospects, consumers are reluctant to spend. Both factors conspire to keep the recovery painfully slow.</p> <p>So, what is keeping the lid on hiring? The usual suspects: the ever-worsening economic turmoil in Europe has clearly been hurting the US economy since summer of 2011; add to that the uncertainties about the election, and the fiscal cliff, and companies are understandably nervous about taking on new hires.</p> <p>Yet, in the world of soundbite and debate-a-thon economics, September's job report was a great boon for the Obama administration. With unemployment now falling below the headline number of 8%, the Obama campaign can now credibly refute Republican challenger Romney's claim that the economy is not improving. And this may, in the end, be worth a whole lot more than one night's debate performance.</p>",
  "<p>\u2712Since it is, quite rightly, open season on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/oct/03/jimmy-savile-abuse-allegations-next-legal-steps?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Jimmy Savile</a>, I might add my two penn'orth. I thought he was a terrible disc jockey, boring, repetitive and more interested in himself than any record or guest. Compared with, say, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/oct/03/tv-review-kenny-everett-story?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Kenny Everett</a>, who was a blazing talent, he was uninventive and predictable. He was the kind of person often described as \"larger than life\", which usually means a \"tedious old show-off\".</p> <p>He was almost inarticulate. \"Now then, now then,\" is not exactly the wittiest catchphrase. I once saw him interview a retired military officer for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim%27ll_Fix_It\" title=\"\">Jim'll Fix It</a>, or \"Jim'll Fix It If The BBC Can Get It For Free\", as it should have been called. The old chap had a collection of Victoria Cross medals. \"Now then, general, are any of these here medals any more different from the rest than what the others are?\" he inquired.</p> <p>People praised him for his charity work but, with some people, charity can be a form of aggression. The message is, \"I'm helping you, so love me.\" And he made sure we all knew about it. Doing good by stealth was not his style.</p> <p>Oddly enough his lascivious tastes were better known than you might imagine. When I chaired <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006r9yq\" title=\"\">The News Quiz</a>, we used to occasionally say things at the recording which we knew would be cut, but which might pique the audience into laughing even louder. Once I said something like, \"Yes, it's about Jimmy Savile, Britain's best-loved celebrity paedophile.\" I expected a gasp, but instead got a knowing laugh. Almost everyone, it seemed, had heard the stories.</p> <p>There are many things people know, or think they know, bits of information passed round like samizdat manuscripts in the Soviet Union: such and such a film star is gay, a politician likes young boys \u2013 that kind of thing. Now and again someone tells us journalists, \"Of course, you know, but you can't print it, can you?\" with a secretive chuckle. And, more often than you might think, it actually is true.</p> <p>Shortly after he died, the <a href=\"http://www.theoldie.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Oldie magazine </a>ran an article about Savile preying on underage girls, but it was completely ignored.</p> <p>\u2712<a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=The%20Labour%20conference%20site:theguardian.com#q=The+Labour+conference+site%3Atheguardian.com&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=imvnsu&amp;source=univ&amp;tbm=nws&amp;tbo=u&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OO9uULLnJci40QWOuIG4BQ&amp;ved=0CCEQqAI&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;fp=c9489f8b4147889c&amp;biw=938&amp;bih=822\" title=\"\">The Labour conference</a> this year was quiet, and the vast press room two-thirds empty most of the time.

Their wretched bosses don't deserve them.</p> <p>I was struck by the way Labour politicians have started to praise famous Tories of the past, if only to compare them favourably with the present lot. So far it's just Disraeli and Peel (and Churchill of course). We'll know politics have changed when a Labour speaker says, \"Sadly, they are no longer the party of Margaret Thatcher \u2026\"</p> <p>I was fascinated to learn there about a website called <a href=\"http://www.leftwingdating.co.uk/\" title=\"\">leftwingdating.co.uk</a>, designed so that people of similar views can get together for fun, romance and discussions of predistribution. The flyer shows a picture of a handsome couple chinking glasses of champagne; it looks as if it ought to have a caption saying something like, \"Book our function room to celebrate those cherished wedding day moments.\"</p> <p>There is also a helpful list of events where you might go with someone you have contacted through the site.

You would have to tick boxes. \"How do you feel about immigration? Totally opposed? Send them all home, now? Hanging's too good for them?\" Or, \"Benefit cuts for the so-called disabled?

She has had the bright idea of telling the last 90 years in British politics by way of extracts from diaries. It's called Events, Dear Boy, Events (\u00a325, Profile Books), and if there is rather too much of Benn and Edwina Currie, there are the more pleasingly acerbic entries of Mullin and Alan Clark.</p> <p>In late 1997, Clark said that the royal family had \"delighted at the elimination of Diana \u2026 and have settled back into their favourite role, the preservation of their own perks and privileges at the expense, wherever necessary, of other individuals and institutions.\" Even Benn might not have written that.

Tomorrow he will be passionate.'\"</p> <p>\u2712My parents lived in Farnham, Surrey, for a quarter of a century. It's a handsome market town, a mixed blend of city commuters and farmworkers, large family houses and charming cottages, small winding lanes and fine old buildings. So naturally, in keeping with modern Britain, it has to be ruined. The local council, <a href=\"http://www.waverley.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Waverley</a>, based away in Goldalming, is almost unanimously Tory. For years, it has been pushing ceaselessly for a hideous new development of houses, shops and offices in the eastern part of the town. Farnham's councillors are outnumbered and can do little to stop the development going ahead, even though local opinion is by every measure utterly opposed to this appalling plan.</p> <p>Aha, you might think, at least they can enlist the support of their local MP! Step forward Jeremy Hunt. You can understand their near despair.</p> <p>\u2712Jack Gold arrived early for his 10pm train at Berkhamsted station.

  "<p>The appeal of any presidential candidate, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/sep/04/comment.usa\">argued Richard Nixon's speechwriter, Raymond Price</a>, is based on a \"gut reaction, unarticulated, non-analytical, a product of the particular chemistry between the voter and the image of the candidate \u2026 [It's] not what's there that counts, it's what's projected.\"</p> <p>In 2008, all the intestinal love went Obama's way. He didn't just advocate change, he looked and acted like change. While John McCain and Sarah Palin peddled in fear, Obama projected hope. He sent a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/03/tucker-carlson-obama-fox-news-bombshell\">\"thrill\" up MSNBC news anchor Chris Matthews' leg</a> and tears down old ladies' cheeks at rallies.</p> <p>Describing the crowd's reaction to him in Rockford, Illinois, Time's <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1546362-2,00.html\">Joe Klein wrote</a>: \"The white people \u2026 are out of control.\" The New York Times' <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/19/opinion/19brooks.html?_r=0\">David Brooks claimed</a>: \"With his multi-ethnic family and his globe-spanning childhood, there is a little piece of everything in Obama.\"</p> <p>When people \u2013 not all, but enough \u2013 looked at him, they felt something before they thought something, and it made them feel better about themselves and the country. Inevitably those feelings would fade in four years when they would also see his record. Fortunately for Obama, until now relatively few were focused on him. Instead, it was Romney's chemistry, or rather lack of it, that dominated.</p> <p>Democrats<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/18/mitt-romney-turning-into-john-kerry-2012-election\"> successfully framed Romney </a>as a wealthy, out-of-touch individual who didn't understand the needs of ordinary Americans. When people \u2013 once again not all, but enough \u2013 thought of him being president, they checked their gut <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2012/08/02/romneys-personal-image-remains-negative/\">and it made them queasy</a>. In July, a woman in West Virginia <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/issues/58_1/John-Boehner-Voters-Need-Not-Love-Mitt-Romney-215934-1.html\">asked Republican House speaker John Boehner</a>: \"Can you make me love Mitt Romney?\" Boehner said: \"No. Listen, we're just politicians. I wasn't elected to play God. The American people probably aren't going to fall in love with Mitt Romney.\"</p> <p>Wednesday's debate didn't make people like Romney but it did give some pause for a second look. It also shifted the focus back on to Obama and created the space to frame him in potentially damaging light. His distracted, absent, distant manner at the podium speaks to a criticism that has often been made that he is aloof, dispassionate and even haughty.</p> <p>This matters because narratives only work when they chime with a pre-existing condition. Tucker Carlson's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/03/tucker-carlson-obama-fox-news-bombshell \">ridiculous bombshell</a> didn't work because few people seriously believe that Obama, who was raised by his white mother and grandparents, really hates white people. Whitewater didn't work against Bill Clinton because few people seriously believed that he was financially corrupt. The Monica Lewinsky scandal, on that other hand, did work, because few had any trouble believing Clinton could not control his sexual appetite.</p> <p>Throughout his presidency, Obama has given the impression of being in some way <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/13/barack-obama-cool-to-cold\"> emotionally disconnected</a> and at times almost passive. This would be less than impressive at the best of times. But during a period of severe economic duress and political gridlock he has often appeared either uninterested and unwilling, or unable to fight back. \"You get the sense that this president, while intellectually engaged, is not emotionally engaged with what the American people are going through,\" says Michael Fletcher, the Washington Post's economics correspondent. \"People want to feel there's someone out there fighting their corner even if that person doesn't win.\"</p> <p>Some have argued that as the first black president, anger is simply not an avenue open to him if he wants to keep the public onside. But as Salim Muwakkil of <a href=\"http://www.inthesetimes.com/\">In These Times </a>pointed out, Obama runs the risk of falling into another stereotype that can be equally problematic.</p> <p>\"In some ways it's the epitome of the cool style,\" he said. \"Almost ironically it's a stereotype. It's like the pimp from Iceberg Slim. The guy who was not perturbed by anything. Murders would happen in his vicinity and he'd carry on as if nothing happened.\"</p> <p>Whatever the reasons, his performance on Wednesday reinforced the notion of a man not fully in the moment or in command of events. According to Ron Suskind's <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2011/09/obamas_economic_quagmire_frank.html \">Confidence Men</a>, Obama's former chief economic adviser, Larry Summers, reportedly told Peter Orszag: \"\"You know, Peter, we're really home alone. There's no adult in charge.\" That's the impression he gave on Wednesday night.</p> <p>Last week, Newt Gingrich <a href=\"http://thehill.com/video/campaign/258689-gingrich-obama-not-a-real-president \">disparaged him </a>saying he was \"not a real president\" and wondering about his \"rhythms\". It was more unsubtle race-baiting from the man who coined the term \"food-stamp president\". But one comment in particular stands out. \"He doesn't do anything that presidents do, he doesn't worry about any of the things the presidents do, but he has the White House, he has enormous power, and he'll go down in history as the president \u2013 and I suspect that he's pretty contemptuous of the rest of us.\" That charge has currency today that it didn't have before.</p> <p>This isn't the first time Obama has turned in a lousy debate performance. He's a good speaker; he's never been a good debater. But it's the first time he's been so bad at such a key moment. The most common, generous, explanation is that it's just not in his character to become excitable and animated, and that authentic beats empathetic. Maybe. But present beats absent and, given the country's needs, urgent beats laid-back.</p> <p>\"Americans would like their president to be sick and needy,\" explains James Zogby, head of the Arab American Institute and executive member of the Democratic executive committee. \"Bill Clinton would shake literally tens of thousands of hands every Christmas. Each person he'd meet would say: 'I think he remembered me.' Obama doesn't like to do it. No real person would like to do it. And therefore he doesn't do it. And people resent that. They want their president to really need them. He doesn't. He's OK, he's relaxed, cool, calm. I'd love him to call me up like Clinton would \u2026 people like that, he doesn't need it.\"</p> <p>But he needs them. And on Wednesday, at least, he lost them.</p>",

  "<p>The first <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/109020652/2012-Reuters-Ipsos-Daily-Election-Tracking-10-04-12\">post-debate poll</a> conducted by Reuters/Ipsos indicates that President Obama is still leading Mitt Romney in voting intention, by 48% to 43% \u2013 but the gap has closed from 48% to 39% pre-debate. I am wary of using a relatively untested online (not phone) poll for analysis, but the survey trends do a good job illustrating why Obama is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/04/mitt-romney-won-debate-win-election\">vulnerable, and yet still ahead</a> in this post-debate environment.</p> <p><strong>1). Mitt Romney remains relatively unknown, and Wednesday night probably helped his favorability</strong></p> <p>Americans know President Obama. They either approve of the job he is doing or they don't. They either hold a favorable view of him or they don't. There's not a lot that is going to change that with a month to go till election day.</p> <p>As I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/30/mitt-romney-fault-loses\">discussed last Sunday</a>, Obama's favorability ratings are actually historically low for a person to get elected president. In fact, no president in CBS News/New York Times, Gallup or NBC/Wall Street Journal data has ever been elected with a net favorability as low as his.</p> <p>The issue has been that Mitt Romney's favorability has been even lower. Wednesday night's debate was seen by <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-presidential-debate-2012-ratings-20121004,0,2136083.story\">nearly 70 million people</a>. After a strong performance, the Ipsos data has Romney gaining 10 points in net favorability. A good portion of that is Republicans coming back home. Still, if Romney can be seen as a viable alternative to the president among at least 50% of the electorate, he's at least in the ball game. Wednesday night helped him down that path.</p> <p><strong>2). Barack Obama may have to begin floating on air to win this election</strong></p> <p>Analysts like to say that Obama is defying gravity by winning in such a poor economy. I've pointed out that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/13/mitt-romney-barack-obama-economy\">this belief is poppycock</a>, as the economy is strong enough for an incumbent to get re-elected. Obama was also <a href=\"http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/10/02/14186700-nbcwsj-poll-obama-maintains-lead-but-romney-within-striking-distance?lite\">leading or tied with</a> Romney on the economy in general, and on pretty much every specific economic issue, including jobs, the middle class and taxes. His lead on other issues and his overall favorability edge combined were going to carry him to victory.</p> <p>The problem for Obama is that his standing on many of these economic issues may have eroded significantly. Mitt Romney gained 9 points on the economy overall, pre- and post-debate, and is up 9 points on taxes, 7 points on jobs and unemployment, and 6 points on the federal deficit (already a strong issue for Romney). If you start applying shifts like this to surveys such as the historically accurate NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, then Romney leads on these issues by 7 to 20 points. Again, Ipsos is only a one-night online survey, but the numbers must be at least somewhat worrying for the president.</p> <p><strong>3). Romney has the potential to continue to gain ground over the weekend</strong></p> <p>It usually takes time for campaign events to fully sink in with the American electorate. Consider the Democrats' highly successful convention. Obama started to gain points immediately, but it wasn't until about week after the the convention that we fully understood the full ramifications of how it shook up the race.</p> <p>Immediate public reaction to the debate isn't as important as how the media <a href=\"http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/10/02/why-news-coverage-of-the-debate-may-matter-more-than-the-debate/\">portrays the debate in news coverage</a>. It would seem that this coverage is only going to drive more supporters into the Romney camp. The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PatrickRuffini/status/253846901403828224\">initial reaction on Twitter</a>, a good source for trends, was 3:2 in favor of Romney winning the debate. That reaction jumped to 4:1 after the debate when the conventional wisdom began to take hold. On Thursday night, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ppppolls/status/254027267729145856\">Public Policy Polling found</a> Virginia voters declaring the winner of the debate to be Romney by a 3:1 margin. That's a wider spread than any of insta-post debate national polls.</p> <p><strong>4). Despite all of this movement in Romney's direction, Obama is still at 48%</strong></p> <p>This, folks, is flatout key. Note that Romney gained ground, but <em>Obama didn't lose any</em> in the overall score. The fact is that in an election with strong third-party candidates, the winner is only <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/21/50percent-rule-misconception\">going to need about 49% of the vote</a>. Obama is right on the goal line. Romney would have to gain almost all the undecideds to overtake Obama. It's mathematically possible, but also mathematically unfeasible. For it to really work, Romney either has to dislodge current Obama support or change the make-up of the electorate. There's no sign he's done either yet.</p> <p><strong>5). Obama remains personally popular regardless of the issues</strong></p> <p>There are two types of fundamentals: issues-based ones and personality-based ones. President Obama led on both of these heading into the debate. Indeed, the two often coincide with one another, but not always. Al Gore <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100919002302/http://abcnews.go.com/sections/politics/2000vote/general/exitpoll_hub.html\">won on the issues</a> in 2000, but lost on the character traits. Todd Akin wins on the issues (save for his original comments on rape) in Missouri, but most definitely loses on the personality side.</p> <p>Obama's favorability rating was unchanged pre- and post-debate. At least in the Ipsos poll, he still has higher net favorability than Romney. I wouldn't be surprised if that deteriorates, should Romney manages to lead on the key issues of the economy going forward. If, however, the issues and personality fundamentals remain in conflict, there's very little that predicts an election outcome as well as the favorability difference between the two candidates.</p> <p>So, the initial polling does not change my views about debate-effects. Romney seems poised to close a 3- to 4-point gap by picking up latent support, but he is probably still going to trail a week from now.</p>",
  "<p>First there was the presidential debate. Now come the all-important ad wars.</p> <p>The campaigns of President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney have now emerged from the Denver event engaged in a frenzy of spin and damage control.</p> <p>Seeking to capitalise on a largely unexpected win, which came after weeks of Romney gaffes and sinking poll numbers, the Republicans have released on to the nation's airwaves a lengthy video featuring footage of the Denver debate and a one-two punch of both negative and positive ads.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IGm47IIRQhc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IGm47IIRQhc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p></p> <p>But President Barack Obama's team have also featured the debate in a new ad, seeking to portray Romney as having misled voters during the highly-anticipated event. It shows Romney saying he was not in favour of a huge new tax plan during the debate in Colorado, interspersed with a news anchor saying his tax plan would in fact cost trillions of dollars and mostly benefit the wealthy. The Obama campaign called the ad Trust, and in the 30-second spot a narrator asks: \"Why won't Romney level with us about his tax plan?\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eV5m1NxffEs?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eV5m1NxffEs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p></p> <p>However, there is little doubt that the debate produced a much greater morale boost and source of campaign ammunition for the Republicans than it did the Democrats. Most media critics, and snap opinion polls of TV viewers, declared Romney as the winner of the debate by a sizeable margin. Obama was seen as turning in a flat and listless performance. The new Romney campaign video has a triumphalist air. It starts by showing Romney and his wife, Ann, walking towards the debate arena like boxers towards the ring. Then, to soaring piano music, it plays clips of Romney's best debate moments and Obama looking pensive or frustrated or down at his feet. The topics highlighted in the video are also largely bemoaning the parlous state of America's economic recovery. \"We know that the path we are taking is not working. It is time for a new path,\" Romney says.</p> <p>That theme is also taken up in a new TV ad from the Romney campaign. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTKOtgibTqw&amp;feature=player_embedded\">Called Twelve Million Jobs</a>, it touts Romney's plans to jump-start America's economy, and features a smiling, casually dressed Romney speaking directly to camera, cut with shots of him greeting an ethnically diverse crowd of workers. \"Let me tell you how I will create 12 million jobs when President Obama couldn't,\" Romney said.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BsHoWjzicUA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BsHoWjzicUA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p></p> <p>However, the largely sunny feel of that advert is not matched by a second Romney ad that was rapidly put up on the airwaves of several key swing states, including, crucially, Ohio where Romney has been trailing badly. That ad, called Who Will Raise Taxes?, charges that an \"independent, non-partisan\" study showed that Obama's tax policies will hike taxes for middle-class American families by $4,000 dollars. However, the study was in fact produced by the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative Washington thinktank.</p> <p>Such finagling of the truth is commonplace with both campaigns, but some experts believe that the attack ads will swamp what had actually been a decent debate where serious issues were discussed. \"This was a real debate with real differences, real clarity.

The incident, in May 2011, was widely regarded as a coup for the Obama administration, following former President Bush's failed seven-year attempt to catch Bin Laden \"dead or alive\".</p> <p>Produced by the Weinstein Company, the film will be broadcast on the National Geographic Channel on Sunday 4 November. \"While some of the characterisations have been dramatised for creative reasons, the core story is an accurate portrayal of an event that ended the longest manhunt in American history,\" the channel said in a statement.</p> <p>A longtime fundraiser for the Democratic party, Weinstein backed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/hillaryclinton\" title=\"The politician on theguardian.com\">Hillary Clinton</a>'s 2008 bid for the presidency but has since transferred his support to Obama. However, Howard T Owens, president of the National Geographic Channel, this week denied that the producer was using the channel to influence the November 6 election. \"Harvey doesn't schedule out network,\" he said. Owens insisted that his channel was \"not political ... we are [only] opportunistic from a programming perspective.\"</p> <p>The screening of Seal Team Six also steals the march on rival production <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/07/osama-bin-laden-film-trailer\" title=\"Osama bin Laden film trailer debuts online\">Zero Dark Thirty</a>, directed by the Oscar-winning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/kathryn-bigelow\" title=\"The director on theguardian.com/film\">Kathryn Bigelow</a> and similarly documenting the hunt for Osama bin Laden. The film opens in the US on 19 December.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama's hopes of holding on to the White House have received a major boost from new figures showing that the US unemployment rate has dropped below 8% for the first time since he took office in January 2009.</p> <p>The US added 114,000 new jobs in September, in line with expectations. But August's disappointing jobs figure was dramatically revised upwards from 96,000 to 142,000, helping to bring the unemployment rate down to 7.8%.</p> <p>\"Today, I believe that as a nation we are moving forward again,\" Obama told a raucous campaign rally in Fairfax, Virginia, on Friday a few hours after the figures were published. \"This morning, we found out that the unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level since I took office.\"</p> <p>Acknowledging that the economy was not out of the woods yet, he added: \"Now, every month's figures reminds us that we have still got too many of our friends and neighbours struggling to pay the bills ... But now is certainly not the time to talk down the economy and score a few political points. It's a reminder that this country has come too far too turn back now.\"</p> <p>Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG, described the report as \"pretty darn good\". Greenhaus highlighted the fact that the total number of employed persons rose by \"a whopping\" 873,000 while the number of unemployed persons declined by 456,000, the largest increase in employment since January 2003.</p> <p>The news could not have been better timed for Obama, whose re-election campaign has been rattled in recent days by his perceived weak performance in his first debate with rival Mitt Romney. The report contained good news for many voters in key demographics being targeted ahead of the election.</p> <p>The unemployment rates for adult men is now 7.3%, for adult women it was 7%. But problems remain. September's unemployment rate for teenagers was 23.7% and there was little change for black Americans (13.4%) or Hispanics (9.9%).</p> <p>The number of people working part time because their hours had been cut back or because they were unable to find a full-time job rose from 8 million in August to 8.6 million in September.</p> <p>\"This is not what a real recovery looks like,\" Romney said in a statement. \"We created fewer jobs in September than in August, and fewer jobs in August than in July, and we've lost over 600,000 manufacturing jobs since president Obama took office.\"</p> <p>He added: \"The results of President Obama's failed policies are staggering \u2013 23 million Americans struggling for work, nearly one in six living in poverty and 47 million people dependent on food stamps to feed themselves and their families.</p> <p>The Republican House speaker John Boehner also noted the figures are too high but, unusually, acknowledged there was some good news too. \"While there is positive news in today's report, job creation is far too slow and the unemployment rate is far too high.\"</p> <p>Conservative business guru Jack Welch, former boss of General Electric, went as far as accusing the Bureau of Labor Statistics of cooking the books. \"Unbelievable jobs numbers\u2026 these Chicago guys will do anything..can't debate so change numbers,\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jack_welch/statuses/254198154260525057\">he said on Twitter</a>. </p> <p>Labor secretary Hilda Solis immediately hit back at claims that the Obama administration might have skewed the jobs numbers. \"I'm insulted when I hear that because we have a very professional civil service,\" Solis told CNBC.</p> <p>The monthly jobs report has become a political hotspot on the 2012 election. Last month's disappointing figures came as the Democrat's wrapped up their convention in Charlotte. \"If last night was the party, this morning is the hangover,\" Romney said in a statement at the time.</p> <p>The final monthly jobs report of the campaign will come just days before the election on 6 November.</p> <p>While Obama can now point to 24 consecutive months of growth, the Republicans argue the rate remains historically weak. An increase of 114,000 barely covers population growth in the US as new entrants come into the job market.</p> <p>Geoff Hoffmann of recruitment firm DHR International said employers were growing increasingly confident but a lot of uncertainty remained.</p> <p>\"There's uncertainty about the impact of healthcare legislation, tax impacts, it's not really clear what is going to happen in 2013 and beyond,\" he said.</p> <p>Hoffmann said recovery was taking place in industries like technology, life sciences and that consumer and retail recruitment were doing \"surprisingly well\". But industries like financial services were still lagging after the financial crisis.</p> <p>Greenhaus said the report was \"95% better than expected\" but warned that slow growth could still come back to bite the recovery in the jobs market. The US recently cut its forecasts for gross domestic product \u2013 the widest measure of economic growth - after a sharp fall in manufacturing orders. \"You can't have jobs growth without economic growth,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>In a valley lashed by wind and rain in the industrial heartland of north-east France, steelworkers blockading the local foundry see their action as a last stand to save their jobs, their factory, their region's economy \u2013 even the entire French steel industry.</p> <p>As thunderstorms raged in the area this week, the symbolism was potent: the picket-line bonfire hissed and went out. The tent where protesters had taken refuge from the elements ditched its concrete anchors and threatened to blow away. \"Let go of nothing,\" someone shouted as men grabbed tent poles. The others laughed.</p> <p>There is little humour to be had these days outside the ArcelorMittal steelworks in Florange, where the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/01/arcelormittal-shut-florange-furnaces-france\" title=\"\">\"temporary\" closure of two blast furnaces was declared permanent on Monday, with the loss of 629 jobs</a>. Bitter jokes and anger are directed at the Indian-born, British-based Lakshmi Mittal, owner of the world's largest steelmaking company. \"That man is a predator,\" said Edouard Martin, head of the CFDT union at Florange where he has worked for 32 years. \"He's not an industrialist, he's a financier.\"</p> <p>Martin, whose father worked at Gandrange, a neighbouring steelworks bought by Mittal in 1999 and closed in 2009, added: \"I'm sick of hearing people say: you are a historic industry but one from the past, you have to move on, do something else.</p> <p>\"I say: you don't need cars or washing machines or TGV trains? Try driving a microchip down the motorway.\"</p> <p>The ArcelorMittal plant at Florange has become the symbol of France's industrial decline and a litmus test for the future of steelmaking in Europe.</p> <p>In the Vall\u00e9e de la Fensch in the Moselle, whose rich iron-ore fields once made it the jewel of France's industrial crown, and where \u2013 for this reason \u2013 the earth is soaked with German and French blood spilled in conflicts over the last 140 years, Florange is the last steelworks standing. It's an industrial crisis that has echoes of the privatisations and plant closures that all but wiped out British steelmaking and coalmining in the 1980s and 90s. Unemployment in this area of France is already above the 10% national average, and the Florange plant, which supplies the car industry, has been hit by a fall in demand for new cars. Peugeot Citro\u00ebn caused outrage in July when it announced it was cutting 8,000 jobs and closing a production line in suburban Paris, but it followed a first-half loss of \u20ac700m (\u00a3560m) and a 20% fall in sales in Europe in the first quarter.</p> <p>Mittal is not shutting the entire site, but the so-called \"hot line\", the blast furnaces, where the iron ore is melted to produce steel, and the neighbouring coke plant.</p> <p>Today the two furnaces, closed \"temporarily\" last year, are idle. The nearby heating stoves are on hold, emitting wisps of smoke into the grey sky. \"It's a sad sight,\" says Maurice Nicotra, 47, surveying the abandoned plant. \"It's dead here now. Mittal told us he would put money into our steel industry, but look where we are.\"</p> <p>France's Socialist president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who visited Florange during his election campaign this year, and Arnaud Montebourg, the minister for industrial renewal, have taken up arms on behalf of the steelworkers and pledged to find a buyer for Florange's furnaces. However, Mittal, who blames falling global demand for steel and high production costs for the closure, has given them just two months to do so, at a time when Hollande is grappling to reduce the public deficit by \u20ac30m and reverse rising unemployment that has topped three million.</p> <p>\"We're all afraid. Over the years all the plants have closed here. If this one goes it won't be easy to find work,\" said Cyril Colpin, 31, a third-generation steelworker employed at Florange since 1999. \"It's not that we don't make money here, it's that we don't make enough money for Mr Mittal. It's about maximum profit, not people.\"</p> <p>Colleague Ben Khachei, 38, employed at Florange for 15 years, agreed.</p> <p>\"We're attached to steelmaking in this region. We identify with the industry. There are people here whose family have worked in steel for three or four generations. When Mittal took over the plant he promised he'd invest and preserve our jobs. We just want him to keep that promise. What can I say to a man motivated by money? I can only say, behind this steelworks are workers, families, a whole region. I can also say we will always need steel.\" While agreed on the need to save Florange, the plant's main unions, the CFDT and Force Ouvri\u00e8re, disagree over how.</p> <p>Walter Broccoli, the local Force Ouvri\u00e8re secretary general, \"doesn't believe for one minute\" that the Hollande government will find a buyer and wants the plant nationalised. \"We want the government to declare steel a strategic asset for the country like electricity and petrol and requisition it,\" he said. \"Oh, and not give a penny to Mittal.\"</p> <p>He added: \"They call us dinosaurs but the steel industry here has always been at the forefront of new technology. I'm not optimistic. I think we're already condemned, but we have to fight to save Florange because if we don't the whole valley will suffer the consequences.\"</p> <p>Back in the leaking tent, Martin says protesters will maintain the blockade. \"All eyes are on Florange. People are watching our battle to see what happens. They know if we lose, there are no guarantees for anyone. We're a historic industrial area, but for 40 years they've treated us like sheep as they shut our factories. This used to be the jewel of French industry. We had crises but survived them because we were willing to adapt to the market and we produced good quality steel.</p> <p>\"If we lose this battle, it's a bad sign for the rest of Europe's steelworks and will boost the multinationalists who will think they can do anything they want.\"</p> <p>He added: \"People say we are more expensive than Chinese workers. It's true. But those same people forget they're also more expensive.</p> <p>\"Everything and everyone is more expensive in France than in China, so what are we to do \u2013 close down Europe and go elsewhere where everyone is paid $80 a month? It's not about pay, it's about the society we live in. Go tell that to Mittal.\"</p> <p>Henri Blaffard, a vice-president of ArcelorMittal Europe, told the local R\u00e9publicain Lorrain newspaper the closure was due to a \"serious crisis in Europe\" that had led to a 25% reduction in demand for steel.</p> <p>\"We cannot produce when there are no orders,\" he said. \"The overcapacity in Europe is recognised by everyone the markets expect us to adapt.\"</p> <p>He said the steel company had invested \u20ac2bn in other French plants at Dunkirk and Fos \"because they were more competitive\".</p>",

  "<p>I'm glad that David Cameron <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2213164/Victory-After-Mail-appeal-PM-WILL-pay-Bomber-Command-tribute.html\" title=\"\">stumped up on the taxpayers' behalf</a> overnight to relieve some very elderly trustees at the Bomber Command memorial trust of the risk that they might be <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-19815835\" title=\"\">stuck with a nasty \u00a3550,000 bill</a>. The payout will cover the unexpected costs of the memorial's opening ceremony on the edge of London's Hyde Park this summer. A bit like a teenage party on Facebook, the launch <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/raf-bomber-command/9361572/Bomber-Command-memorial-service-as-it-happened.html\" title=\"\">got a bit out of hand</a>.</p> <p>All right, I know what you may be thinking. There are better things to spend money on when times are hard than a memorial to people who shouldn't have been carpet-bombing German cities night after night in the way they did during the second world war. It is a controversy that pre-figures in a relatively low-tech way the one raging today about the Obama administration's use of drones to kill its enemies in Afghanistan and Pakistan.</p> <p>If you are, you may have a point about the efficacy of Bomber Command's record. But yesterday I happened to drive past an old wartime aerodrome in the East Midlands and saw a simple plaque in a hedgerow. Measuring about 3ft x 4ft, marked by the British and American flags, it memorialised the many thousands of bomb crews who never made it back. The casualty rate was nearly one in two. <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2210283/Solved-70-years-The-mystery-missing-Lancaster-bomber-crew.html?ito=feeds-newsxml\" title=\"\">You cannot deny their courage</a>.</p> <p>As for the money, well, in the big picture it's detail when set against, say, the cost of the west coast rail franchise fiasco or a spot of bankers' tax avoidance. Ahead of his party conference, Cameron is in enough trouble with his party and the tabloids not to want to quibble. Incidentally, a rail man at Labour's conference told me that Britain's rail network has still to recover from gross over-use and lack of repair in the two wars, then being starved of investment during the impoverished post-war decades.</p> <p>So old men, the memorial's trustees who simply did their duty 70 years ago at great personal risk, don't deserve to be forced to sell their homes by people demanding money for insurance or other unplanned expenditure. I can't help wondering if some demanding payment are what people in 1939-45 might have called spivs or war profiteers, making money from other people's troubles via the black market and other dodgy activity. The entrepreneurial spirit doesn't always whistle patriotic tunes.</p> <p>I'm still uneasy on several counts, not least of all the strange surge of memorialising so long after the event and the dubious uses put to it: jingoism is always a tabloid temptation. There's also the aesthetics of the current craze. I was quite shocked when I first saw the new <a href=\"http://www.bombercommandmemorial.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Bomber Command memorial</a> \u2013 it's at the Piccadilly end of the park \u2013 by how large and insensitive it is \u2013 not the bronze fliers at its centre, but the pompous neo-classical columns around it.</p> <p>Hopelessly misjudged, I'd say. You'll know what I mean if you've ever seen the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_Veterans_Memorial\" title=\"\">Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall on the Mall in Washington DC</a>, its eloquent, sorrowful subtlety \u2013 57,000 (about the same number as Bomber Command lost) names all there on a polished black wall, set low in a dip in the ground. Not a good war, but a good memorial.</p> <p>But returning to Bomber Command's role, was it justified? Guardian art critic Jonathan Jones makes a pretty efficient assault on the dodgy aesthetics of morally dodgy policies <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jun/29/bomber-command-memorial-artistic-jingoism\" title=\"\">here</a>, more confidently than I would.</p> <p>By 1945, Churchill himself, no faintheart, was troubled by what the RAF \u2013 later joined by the USAF - had done in carpet-bombing German cities, at a time (in the early years at least) when Britain was taking a pounding from bombers and U-boats and had no other way of hitting back than by bomber raids that disproved Hitler's boasts.</p> <p>Historians have argued ever since about Dresden, Hamburg and other cities, Hiroshima too, of course. My qualms are usually settled by the sound of revisionist German historians \u2013 in Japan they don't need to revise a view which never included much contrition \u2013 arguing that the city bombings were war crimes.</p> <p>What I say is, let's not blame wars of European conquest entirely on Hitler or Kaiser Bill. Let's share it with Bismarck, a domestic tyrant and foreign aggressor, who doesn't get his share of the stick because of Germany's economic and cultural brilliance during his ascendancy. It all ended in tears, not all of which have yet been shed (have they, Mrs Merkel?).</p> <p>The more interesting question is, not \"was it legal?\" but was it wise? I heard an American professor on the radio today making that distinction about the drone raids which the Obama administration \u2013 not looking so durable after this week's debate with Mitt Romney \u2013 has used so widely.</p> <p>If the intelligence is good and the right target hit why risk American lives, goes the argument. Yes, but it isn't always good and civilians get killed, as they did in Hamburg, Berlin and the rest, as they did in London too, during the Blitz of 1940-41, which was arguably less discriminating than drones. Even when the war was as good as lost, London suffered the V1 and V2 raids of 1944-45, the frightening last flourish of German aerial aggression that had begun at Guernica and other towns in Republican Spain's civil war (1936-39).</p> <p>The American professor was confident that, in international law as well as US law, the drone attacks are justified, though others disagree. There is also a primitive sense of unfairness in drone attacks launched from Arizona, which \u2013 this is absurd, but heartfelt \u2013 did not apply in quite the same way to Bomber Command, which took its chances and suffered heavy losses of its own.</p> <p>But is it/was it wise? Does it create more militants than it kills, as the professor put it? Did it weaken German industrial capacity or did they patch it up? Did it destroy civilian morale or did it stiffen citizen resolve? After Vietnam, Lebanon and other air-based failures, it's commonplace today to dismiss the case that bombing works.</p> <p>But I suspect that's a retro-fitted verdict. Such issues are rarely black or white. After years of war and deep suffering the desire for revenge was very powerful and very human. Few spoke against it. They may have been the wiser few, but it took time to heal the wounds.</p> <p>As the current tussle between Berlin and Athens \u2013 occasionally between London and Dublin too \u2013 reminds us, it sometimes takes even longer to forget than forgive. That's a more subtle debate and Cameron, squeezed by the tabloids ahead of his party conference, may be forgiven for not giving it much thought on Thursday.</p>",
  "<p>Amid thunder and driving rain, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez stormed to the conclusion of his toughest presidential race yet on Thursday with a passionate address to hundreds of thousands of supporters in Caracas.</p> <p>The mass rally transformed the city centre into a sea of cheering, dancing, red-shirted followers on the final day of campaigning before Sunday's vote, which looks likely to be the closest since the former tank commander won power in 1998.</p> <p>The turn-out was bigger than the huge opposition rally staged last Sunday by his rival Henrique Capriles, who has narrowed the gap between the two candidates but is still significantly behind in most polls.</p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez is the strong favourite, but few are predicting a landslide victory on the scale of past wins. Having battled cancer for most of the past year, he has been less visible than during previous campaigns.</p> <p>With many in the electorate frustrated at high murder rates and declining infrastructure, the opposition believe this is their best chance to grab power.</p> <p>But the president has repeatedly disproved his critics. Although some predicted his illness was so bad that he would not survive until election day, he has picked up the pace in the past week and looked robust on Thursday as he spoke, danced and sang on stage despite the torrential downpour.</p> <p>\"We are playing for life. In our hands we will not lose the fatherland, we will not lose the future of the fatherland,\" he proclaimed to a fervent crowd. He led a chorus of the national anthem, played air guitar to a campaign soundtrack and led his family on stage to huge applause.</p> <p>But as well as triumphalism and defiance, Ch\u00e1vez has added an unusual degree of contrition in recent speeches, where he has tended to refer to himself in the third person: \"I have made many mistakes, but I am here with all my soul. Ch\u00e1vez is not me. Ch\u00e1vez is the people,\" he said at a rally on Sunday. \"Ch\u00e1vez will not fail you the next term \u2026 during the next term he will be a better president, more efficient, a better companion.\"</p> <p>If he wins another term, aides say the president is preparing to do more to address security and economic concerns in recognition of the shortcomings that have eroded his popularity. But his core of support remains vast.</p> <p>The crowds had been gathering in Bol\u00edvar Avenue and other major thoroughfares since the morning. Some had travelled hundreds of miles on overnight buses. Others had come by subway, motorbike or foot from the Caracas barrios to show their support for a politician whom they credit for doing more for the poor than any other leader in the country's history.</p> <p>\"I'm here to show support for Ch\u00e1vez because I've seen how the country has been transformed in the past 14 years,\" said Ligia Escalona, a law student from Lara state, who had left at 1am to make the long journey to Caracas. \"Thanks to the education programs, people who have not previously had access to schooling are now literate and have an opportunity to go to college.\"</p> <p>Many wore red and blue shirts emblazoned with the president's eyes or slogans declaring \"Ch\u00e1vez, heart of the fatherland\". Some wore hats bearing the portraits of the heroes of Latin America's left: Ch\u00e1vez, Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, Fidel Castro, Che Guevara, Rafael Correa and Evo Morales. Others carried banners reading \"On the way to victory on 7 October.\"</p> <p>The streets were filled with noise as well as colour: vuvuzelas, whistles, drums, loudspeakers playing salsa mixed with political lyrics, and chants of \"Oh, aah, Ch\u00e1vez no se va\" (Ch\u00e1vez won't go) \u2013 a slogan first heard after a failed 2002 coup against the president.</p> <p>Junior Landaetta, a police student, had come with a samba band to add to the fiesta spirit. Aged 18, he is part of a new generation who will vote for the first time on Sunday \u2013 a key segment of the electorate in a country that has undergone rapid population growth in recent years.</p> <p>\"I'll vote for Ch\u00e1vez until death,\" he said as his band passed by the Congress building. \"He has done so much for the country. If Capriles wins, I think everything will fall to pieces.\"</p> <p>Polls, analysts and the electorate are sharply divided about the likely outcome, but there is widespread agreement that Ch\u00e1vez has lost some of his previously enormous support.</p> <p>\"The serious polls show Ch\u00e1vez will win by about 14%. But I can see that Capriles has done a good campaign and that the gap has been closing in the last few days. It might now be between 7 and 10 points,\" said Nicmer Evans, a left-leaning political scientist at the Central University of Venezuela. \"The main reasons why Ch\u00e1vez's popularity has waned is flaws in management. Although he has been very successful in creating political consciousness, Ch\u00e1vez accepts criticism about the quality of the revolution.\"</p> <p>\"I think it will be close and that Capriles will win,\" said Teodoro Petkoff, a former Marxist guerilla, founder of the Socialist party and former presidential election challenger. \"If the gap is just 1 or 2 points for either contender, it could unleash violence.\"</p> <p>Close aides of the president dismiss rumours of possible unrest, saying the president will accept the result, whatever the outcome.</p> <p>But his supporters on the streets said they would defend the gains they have won under Ch\u00e1vez. \"Capriles is a wolf in sheep's clothing. He would dismantle everything we've built,\" said Henry Reveron, a former peasant who has been able to train as a lawyer under one of Ch\u00e1vez's social \"misions\".</p> <p>\"If Ch\u00e1vez loses, we'll go into unwavering opposition. This is a peaceful revolution, but if needed we'll go into the mountains and fight with our nails, teeth, arms and whatever is necessary. Venezuela is no longer naive.\"</p>",

Let's just hope there's no snakes on Airforce One. </p> <p>Finally, newscaster Jennifer Livingston<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUOpqd0rQSo&amp;feature=player_embedded\"> reacts with dignity</a> to a horrible email criticising her weight. It's uplifting. It's emotional. It's thought-provoking. It makes you want to visit La Crosse, Wisconsin. Wikipedia says La Crosse won the best natural tasting water award in September 2007. </p> <p><strong>Guardian Viral Video Chart.
