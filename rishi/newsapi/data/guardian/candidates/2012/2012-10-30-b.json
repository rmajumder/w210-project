  "<p>Driving into Asbury Park on the famed Jersey Shore, the true scale of the damage from Sandy is not immediately apparent. The power is out, and a few trees are down, but people are still in their homes. </p> <p>Then you reach Loch Arbour, a tiny community nearby, and are greeted by a row of six houses that once proudly faced out to the Atlantic. Now they are wrecks. </p> <p>One of the homes, a two-storey wood-panelled affair painted pink, is missing almost its entire ground floor. One side of the front wall has been swept away. Inside the furniture is gone, replaced by three feet of sand. The back wall disappeared too when the storm surge swept clean through the house and across two gardens behind. The home only has one full supporting wall left and has been cordoned off by police. </p> <p>Bill Gleeson, a funeral home director, owns the home next door. He's lived there with his family since 1986. His home has been more fortunate, most of the walls are intact, although inside there are water marks up to 5ft high in places. The floor is covered in a thick layer of sand.</p> <p>\"The water just washed right through,\" Gleeson said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AdamGabbatt/status/263388826079207425\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Bill Gleeson's house in Loch Arbour suffered severe damage. 3ft of sand left inside. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23sandy\">#sandy</a> cc @<a href=\"https://twitter.com/matthewwells\">matthewwells</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/4nJdinLt\" title=\"http://twitter.com/AdamGabbatt/status/263388826079207425/photo/1\">twitter.com/AdamGabbatt/st\u2026</a></p>&mdash; Adam Gabbatt (@AdamGabbatt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamGabbatt/status/263388826079207425\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-30T21:16:04+00:00\">October 30, 2012</a></blockquote> <script src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script> </figure>  <p>A police officer said no one had been injured, but no one will be returning any time soon.</p> <p>This little row of houses seems to have borne the brunt of the storm on this stretch of coast, with damage more limited in either direction. The main problem for the fire department on Tuesday afternoon was towing cars off the beach, as gawkers headed down to the coast to survey the damage. </p> <p>\"Extremely windy but we were pretty blessed not to get the rain because that would have made it a lot worse,\" said Virginia Ferraro, whose husband was engaged in digging out a fire rescue van that had got stuck trying to help out the driver of a white sedan.</p> <p>\"It was crazy windy,\" said Ferraro, whose home escaped damage. \"But they warned us.

Newark, the state's largest city and home to one of the country's biggest airports, is largely without power. Much of the state's famous 127-mile shoreline is underwater. </p> <p>In Seaside Heights hundreds of homes have been covered in sand and amusement rides have been washed away. People had to be rescued from rooftops in Sayreville. Residents living on New Jersey's barrier islands have been cut off from the mainland, and levees have broken in northern New Jersey leaving at least four towns with up to 6ft of water. </p> <p>Some 5,500 people are currently housed in five shelters across the state and a sixth is being opened. Christie said every line in the state's rail system had been damaged, including major hubs Hoboken and Secaucus. Kearny rail yard was surrounded by floodwaters.</p> <p>\"This is beyond anything I ever thought I would see,\" Christie said at a news conference as the eastern seaboard of the US woke to widespread destruction from hurricane Sandy. </p> <p>The state's roads are similarly devastated. Christie said there are 173 incidents statewide involving highway closures, including 7ft-high \"debris fields\". He asked people to avoid travel unless absolutely necessary and said employees should ask staff to stay home.</p> <p>\"We have a lot of work to do. I have absolute confidence that we will be able to do and do it together. I have confidence in the fact that we will have complete support from the president of the United States and the federal authorities,\" said Christie.</p> <p>The governor, recently seen as a potential vice-presidential pick for Republican hopeful Mitt Romney and a likely presidential contender in 2016, was full of praise for Barack Obama. He said the president had been \"outstanding\" and praised Obama's swiftness in designating New Jersey a disaster zone, opening up federal funds for relief work.</p> <p>\"I have to say, the administration the president, himself and Fema [federal emergency management agency] administrator Craig Fugate have been outstanding with us so far,\" Christie told ABC's Good Morning America. \"We have a great partnership with them.\"</p> <p>Christie said Obama had called Monday night and offered to help in any way he could.</p> <p>\"I want to thank the president personally for his personal attention to this,\" said Christie.</p> <p>On Fox News Christie was asked whether he would be touring the disaster-stricken state with Romney. \"I have no idea, nor am I the least bit concerned or interested,\" Christie said. \"I've got a job to do here in New Jersey that's much bigger than presidential politics, and I could care less about any of that stuff.</p> <p>\"I've got 2.4 million people out of power; I've got devastation on the shore; I've got floods in the northern part of my state. If you think right now I give a damn about presidential politics then you don't know me.\"</p> <p>Christie said Sandy had affected twice the number of people who were hit by last year's tropical storm Irene. He said it had taken eight days for the state to get back on track after Irene. \"This may take longer,\" he said. Christie said weather conditions were still so bad that the full extent of the damage would not be known for the next 24 to 48 hours.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama was due to tour some of the areas hardest hit by superstorm Sandy as he and his rival Mitt Romney sought to navigate the tricky political waters stirred up by disaster.</p> <p>With less than a week to go until the presidential election, Obama has left the campaign trail to focus almost exclusively on dealing with the aftermath of the disaster. He appears to be gaining an early political advantage from his handling of the crisis, with a prominent Mitt Romney supporter, New Jersey governor Chris Christie, describing the president's response as \"outstanding\".</p> <p>The White House said on Tuesday night that Obama will travel to New Jersey to inspect the storm damage with Christie. He is due to meet people recovering from the storm as well as members of the emergency services involved in the rescue operation.</p> <p>Romney, stuck on the sidelines in Ohio and frustrated over two lost campaign days, is to take a gamble by returning to the campaign trail on Wednesday in Florida. The risk is that he could alienate voters with partisan speeches at a time when most are still focused on the damage and deaths resulting from the storm.</p> <p>Wednesday could provide one of the striking image of the election: Obama touring the stricken sites in New Jersey alongside Christie, a Republican, contrasting with Romney campaigning in Florida. Obama can present an image of standing above politics as he co-ordinates rescue and clean-up operations.</p> <p>Sandy could turn out to have a decisive role in the outcome of next Tuesday's election in much the same way that the response of Obama and his opponent John McCain did in the face of the economic collapse in 2008.</p> <p>Although the early benefit appears to be going to Obama, there is danger, too, for the president if complaints begin to emerge of incompetence. The public mood could also quickly sour if there are long delays in restoring power to the millions across the east coast currently without electricity.</p> <p>Obama, after declaring New York and New Jersey to be disaster areas, which opens the way for federal aid, held a video conference from the Situation Room at the White House with members of his cabinet and the emergency services to ensure that help is getting to the stricken areas and that power will be restored as quickly as possible.</p> <p>A White House statement said: \"The president told his team that their top priority is to make sure all available resources are being provided to state and local responders as quickly as possible and directed them to identify and resolve any potential bottlenecks or shortfalls should they arise.\"</p> <p>Obama has been careful to avoid being overtly political, but his stress on the extent of federal aid going to the worst-hit states indirectly allows him to draw a distinction between himself and Romney.</p> <p>Romney, in a debate last year with other Republican candidates seeking the presidential nomination, advocated that the federal emergency management agency (Fema), which is overseeing the rescue and clean-up operations, should have its budget cut to help reduce the federal deficit.</p> <p>While Romney was advocating the transfer of some Fema powers to states and did not specifically say this would result in less money for emergency operations, the clip from the debate is being shown repeatedly on television and could harm him.</p> <p>It is fast developing into a potentially embarrassing campaign issue for the Republican challenger, with Democrats stressing the importance of the federal government's strategic overview.</p> <p>The New York Times, in an editorial, described Romney's plan as absurd. \"Those in Hurricane Sandy's path are fortunate that, for now, that ideology has not replaced sound policy,\" the editorial said.</p> <p>Romney was pressed 14 times on the issue by reporters shouting questions at him but all were ignored.</p> <p>The extent to which Romney has been sidelined by the storm was evident in the Dayton area, Ohio, where he held a hurriedly re-organised event on Tuesday.</p> <p>A 'victory rally' was changed into 'a storm relief' event, and Romney restricted his comments in a highly shortened five-minute address to praising the \"generosity of the American people \u2013 it's part of the American way\".</p> <p>Romney recalled how when he was governor of Massachusetts his state had welcomed refugees from the 2005 Katrina hurricane in New Orleans.</p> <p>CNN encapsulated Romney's problem. It broadcast barely a sentence or two of his speech before abruptly cutting away to its storm coverage.</p> <p>After speaking, Romney \"set to work\" packing up tins of food and bottles of juice that local people had donated to victims of the storm in New Jersey.</p> <p>While Romney in person showed notable restraint in fending off politics for the day, the same could not be said for his wider campaign. Radio adverts warning voters that \"Ohio cannot afford four more years of Obama's failed policies\" were still blazing across the state.</p> <p>Obama had been planning to visit Ohio on Wednesday but cancelled the trip.</p> <p>One of the biggest surprise endorsement for Obama's stewardship during the storm came from Christie, who at one time was being touted as a potential Republican presidential candidate.</p> <p>\"The federal government's response has been great,\" he told NBC, adding that he had been on the phone with Obama several times up to midnight Monday. New Jersey is one of the worst-hit areas.</p> <p>He had asked the president to designate New Jersey a disaster area and added: \"The president has been outstanding in this.\"</p> <p>In a separate television interview, Christie, who has been out campaigning regularly on Romney's behalf, said: \"The president has been all over this and deserves great credit.\"</p> <p>The Obama campaign used its mammoth email list of supporters, normally subjected to regular daily pleas for donations, to urge them to offer financial help to the American Red Cross.</p> <p>Although Obama is not campaigning personally, his campaign teams are carrying on as normal in the crucial swing states. The disruption has been worst in New York and New Jersey but neither are likely to have an impact on the election as they are both solidly Democratic.</p> <p>It is the eight or so swing states that will determine the outcome and, apart from Virginia, New Hampshire and North Carolina, they have been untouched by the storm. Elsewhere, Obama and Romney staff and volunteers were pursuing their schedules, rounding up potential supporters and trying to persuade them to vote early.</p> <p>Polling has been disrupted by the storm but the latest show the two neck and neck, with Romney enjoying a one- or two-point lead nationally, but Obama ahead in five of the eight swing states, Romney in two and the two tied in Virginia.</p>",
  "<p>Like the huge crane dangling precipitously above Columbus Circle in a New York City, the 2012 election has been left hanging by Hurricane Sandy, bringing the presidential campaign to a halt and silencing the chorus of polls and forecasts that had dominated the news until a few days ago.</p> <p>But while Sandy has dominated the nation's TV screens, away from the eastern seaboard it has been more like politics as usual. Both the Romney and Obama campaigns have been quietly revising their plans and plotting new strategies as the clock ticks down to polling day on 6 November, while congressional candidates have continued to grapple with their opponents in key Senate and House races around the country.</p> <p>Here's the biggest political news you may have missed while Sandy was doing its worst.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Both presidential campaigns largely suspended active campaigning by their candidates</strong>, with Barack Obama staying in the White House and Mitt Romney electing to hold hybrid \"storm relief\" events with supporters instead, offering to collect donations of dry goods for those in the affected areas. But by Tuesday afternoon, as the flood waters receded on the east coast, <a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/blog/memo-pennsylvania\">the Romney campaign announced an event</a> by the Republican candidate in Florida, suggesting that it was eager to return to full-throated campaigning as soon as possible.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The biggest political move of the week may be the Romney campaign's decision to throw resources into Pennsylvania</strong>, often seen as a solidly Democratic state but one which has lately shown less enthusiasm for Obama and Bob Casey, the Democratic senator struggling for re-election. After a long silence, the pro-Romney Super Pacs Crossroads and Restore Our Future have committed millions of dollars to the state, while the Romney campaign itself has been buying ad time for the last two days before the election, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/burns-haberman/2012/10/romney-starts-reserving-time-in-pennsylvania-for-last-147690.html\">Politico reports</a>.</p> <p>While Democrats dismissed the Romney move as a head-fake, the Romney campaign points out: \"Over the past few years we have seen Pennsylvania voting for a Republican senator and a Republican governor, and Republicans win control of the state house in addition to the state senate.\"</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Both campaigns suspended some advertising on the east coast but further inland the ad wars continued</strong>. The Romney campaign debuted an controversial attack ad in Ohio, claiming: \"Obama took GM and Chrysler into bankruptcy and sold Chrysler to Italians who are going to build Jeeps in China. Mitt Romney will fight for every American job.\" With Chrysler's Jeep production line a major employer in Toledo, Ohio, <a href=\"http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20121028/POLITICS01/210280314\">fact-checkers leapt on the ad's claim</a>, and Chrysler itself released a statement: \"Jeep has no intention of shifting production of its Jeep models out of North America to China.\"</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>While Obama stayed near the Rose Garden, his high-profile surrogates Bill Clinton and vice-president Joe Biden made campaign appearances in Florida and Ohio</strong>. The pair made a combined apearance in Youngstown, Ohio on Monday, and both made heavy criticism of Romney's claims about Jeep production being moved to China.<a href=\"http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/2012/oct/30/biden-clinton-team-up-at-ohio-campaign-stop/\"> Clinton offered his own pungent interpretation of Chrysler's response</a>: \"That's the biggest load of bull in the world that they would ever shut down American operations.\"</p> <p>Biden said the Romney claims were bizarre: \"This guy pirouettes more than a ballerina.\"</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Minnesota may join Pennsylvania in being transformed into a battleground state during the last few days of the election campaign</strong>. Both the Obama and Romney teams had been buying advertising in the usually solid blue state but the news that <a href=\" http://www.startribune.com/politics/national/176263801.html\">Bill Clinton would campaign in the state on Tuesday</a> was a sign of Democratic nervousness. The former president attracted a crowd of 1,800 to his event at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, with a later rally planned in Duluth.</p> <p><a href=\" http://www.dl-online.com/event/article/id/70854/group/homepage/\">Clinton also campaigned in Fargo, North Dakota</a>, for Heidi Heitkamp, the Democratic candidate for the US Senate who is running a surprisingly strong campaign. But despite Clinton's presence, Obama was only mentioned once at the rally in the heavily Republican state.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Opinion pollsters have been hampered by the impact of Sandy</strong>, both in contacting voters in swing states directly affected and because their own call centres \u2013 concentrated in New Jersey in several cases \u2013 have been compromised by the storm. Gallup and Rasmussen both suspended their daily tracking polls for the duration of the storm. But those polls that have been done continue to show exactly what the pre-storm polls revealed: a close race between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama.</p> <p>A Pew Research national poll released on Monday had Obama and Romney tied on 47%. Another national poll, for NPR, also found a presidential race tied at 47% apiece, but showed a 50%-46% advantage to Obama in the battleground states of Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Virginia, North Carolina and Florida.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Mitt Romney's previous comments about reforming or cutting Fema have been thrust into the spotlight by Sandy</strong>. In a GOP presidential primary debate, Romney appeared to say that Fema should be abolished and its funds provided to individual states or the private sector for disaster relief. Asked repeatedly by journalists to discuss Fema at his storm relief event in Ohio on Tuesday, Romney gave no response.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The closely-fought Senate election between Scott Brown and Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts suffered from Sandy, after the final debate between the two was cancelled</strong>. Two new polls this week show it continues to be a neck-and-neck contest: a Boston Globe poll on Monday had Brown moving into a slender 45%-43% lead among committed voters, while a Suffolk University poll on Tuesday has Warren leading by 53% to Brown's 46%.</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney abided by his promise to suspend his bid for the White House for the day in respect for the victims of the east coast disaster, although behind the frontline his campaign kept up its attacks on President Obama through surrogates and media marketing.</p> <p>Romney eschewed an appearance on stage at Fairmont high school in Kettering, on the outskirts of Dayton, Ohio, choosing instead to stand on a humble bench in front of stacks of tinned food, rice and bottled drinks that had been donated by the local community. He didn't mention Obama or the election once, sticking to a script that was patriotic though not party political.</p> <p>\"We have heavy hearts,\" he began, referring in a speech shortened to just five minutes to the devastation in New Jersey, New York and other parts of the north-east. He then praised the generosity of local people which he called \"part of the American way.\"</p> <p>The event had initially been scheduled for Monday as a \"victory rally\", but was hurriedly shifted to Tuesday and recast as a \"storm relief\" event when the scale of the damage that would be wrought by Sandy became apparent. \"We won't be able to solve all the problems with our efforts this morning,\" Romney said, \"but one of the things I have learnt in life is that you though you can't solve all the problems you do whatever you can.\"</p> <p>While up front Romney kept to the spirit of the unspoken truce that has been declared between him and his presidential foe in the wake of storm Sandy, behind the scenes an aggressive and at times ugly campaign in the crucial battleground of Ohio showed no sign of letting up. John McCain, the previous Republican candidate to compete against Obama in 2008, was travelling around Ohio on Tuesday appearing at \"storm relief\" events.</p> <p>But he also went on conservative talk radio on Tuesday morning and accused the president of orchestrating a \"massive cover-up\" over the killing of the US ambassador and three other Americans in Benghazi. Romney's brother Scott and his niece Rhona were campaigning across Michigan; they too went on talk radio, openly criticising Obama's economic policies and advocating Romney's alternative plan without any attempt at restraint.</p> <p>Across Ohio, Romney campaign adverts continued to warn voters that \"Ohio cannot afford four more years of this failed presidency\". The adverts were being aired with as much apparent frequency as before the storm broke.</p>",

  "<p>Residents in large parts of America's east coast spent Tuesday surveying the damage caused by one of the worst storms ever to hit the region.</p> <p>Superstorm Sandy tore through New Jersey and New York after making landfall Tuesday evening near Atlantic City. But the damage was more widespread, covering a number of states north of North Carolina.</p> <p>Here's a rundown of trail of destruction Sandy has left in her path:</p> <h2>Deaths</h2> <p>As of Tuesday mid-morning, at least 33 deaths had been attributed to the superstorm across seven states. That figure looks certain to rise. Of the known deaths, 17 were in New York state \u2013&#xa0;the majority the result of falling trees and branches.</p> <p>It adds to the 69 people known to have died when Sandy ripped through the Caribbean ahead of making its way up the Atlantic coast. In addition, at least one death in Canada has been blamed on Sandy.</p> <h2>Power blackouts</h2> <p>More than seven million homes and businesses have been left without power as a result of the storm. Whole neighbourhoods in Manhattan \u2013 the most densely populated area in the US \u2013 went out, with power being lost \"river to river,\" mayor Michael Bloomberg said. Some of the blackouts were deliberate, with power giant ConEd shutting off services to protect underground equipment in New York City.</p> <p>In New Jersey, an estimated 2.4 million people were left without electricity. State governor Chris Christie warned that families could be left without heat or electricity for more than a week.</p> <p>Connecticut was also badly hit, with more than 615,000 households left in the dark.</p> <h2>Housing</h2> <p>Hundreds of thousands of people were ordered to evacuate after being identified as being most at risk from the storm. In lower Manhattan and low-lying parts of Brooklyn, 375,000 people were told to leave their homes. In Delaware, 50,00 people were evacuated, while in Atlantic City, New Jersey, 30,000 residents were told to find alternative shelter.</p> <h2>Flooding<br></h2> <p>Record storm surges left much of lower Manhattan battling rising waters. New Jersey suffered some of the worst of the flooding, with the town of Moonachie needing rescuing after a levee broke.</p> <p>Authorities said that about 800 people, some of them living in a trailer park, were left stranded as a result. In Hoboken, around half of the town was cut off by floodwater, according to eyewitnesses.</p> <h2>Snow</h2> <p>Parts of West Virginia were under a foot of snow and counties in Kentucky were put under a winter storm warning. Likewise, areas of Virginia, Ohio and Maryland reported snow. A blizzard in Maryland resulted in a pile-up of tractor trailers that blocked part of Interstate 68. As well as being a traffic hazard, heavy snow increases the likelihood of power lines being brought down.</p> <h2>Fires</h2> <p>Flooded basements and broken power lines have increased the risk of fires breaking out. A huge blaze in a flooded area of the New York borough of Queens destroyed up to 100 houses in one of the most dramatic incidents of the storm. Three people were injured in the effort to rescue residents.</p> <h2>Public transport</h2> <p>Across the north-east, major cities ground to a standstill as mass transit systems suspended services in anticipation of expected floodwaters. In New York City, bridges and tunnels to and from Manhattan closed, completing the stranding of the island following the buffering of subway trains.</p> <p>Amtrak said Wednesday that it would make a decision later in the day as to whether it would resume train services linking cities across the north-east.</p> <h2>Roads<br></h2> <p>Roads across the region remain hazardous, due to high winds and the possibility of fallen branches. Manhattan remains cut off after commuter tunnels flooded and bridges were shut. Jersey City remained closed to cars Tuesday after the traffic light system went out.</p> <h2>Hospitals</h2> <p>NYU hospital in midtown Manhattan was among the buildings to experience a power blackout. The back-up system also went out, resulting in the evacuation of 215 patients \u2013 including infants from its neonatal intensive care unit.</p> <h2>Communications<br></h2> <p>Phone and cable companies are still assessing the damage caused by the<br>storm, but outages have occurred across the regions. Verizon, the largest provider in the north-east, reported that its facilities in downtown Manhattan had flooded, shutting down mobile and internet for customers. Meanwhile AT&amp;T said it had \"issues\" in the worst hit areas, and was in the early stages of checking for damage.</p> <h2>Flights</h2> <p>More than 15,000 flights across the north-east region were grounded, and it could be some days before normal service resumes. The two main international airports servicing New York City \u2013 JFK and Newark \u2013 were closed, as was LaGuardia, the domestic hub. New York accounts for a quarter of all US flights, so the cancellation has had a knock-on effect across the county.</p> <h2><br>Political impact</h2> <p>The storm has led to a suspension of politics as usual, with Barack Obama and Mitt Romney forced to shelve campaigning for at least 48 hours.

  "<p>New Jersey has suffered unthinkable devastation from hurricane Sandy, governor Chris Christie said on Tuesday, after the superstorm smashed into the state's famous shoreline and swept inland, killing at least three, leaving 2.4 million people without power and effectively bringing the region to a standstill.</p> <p>\"This is beyond anything I ever thought I would see,\" Christie said at a news conference as the eastern seaboard of the US woke to widespread destruction from Sandy. The storm made landfall close to Atlantic City, causing extensive flooding at the state's gambling mecca, and has left much of its famous 127-mile shoreline underwater.</p> <p>Residents living on New Jersey's barrier islands have been cut off from the mainland, and levees have broken in northern New Jersey leaving at least four towns with up to 6ft of water. Some 5,500 people are currently housed in five shelters across the state and a sixth is being opened. Christie said every line in the state's rail system had been damaged, including major hubs Hoboken and Secaucus. Kearny rail yard was surrounded by floodwaters.</p> <p>The state's roads are similarly devastated. Christie said there are 173 incidents statewide involving highway closures, including 7ft-high \"debris fields\". He asked people to avoid travel unless absolutely necessary and said employees should ask staff to stay home.</p> <p>\"We have a lot of work to do. I have absolute confidence that we will be able to do and do it together. I have confidence in the fact that we will have complete support from the president of the United States and the federal authorities,\" said Christie.</p> <p>The governor, recently seen as a potential vice presidential pick for Republican hopeful Mitt Romney and a likely presidential contender in 2016, was full of praise for Barack Obama. He said the president had been \"outstanding\" and praised Obama's swiftness in designating New Jersey a disaster zone, opening up federal funds for relief work.</p> <p>\"I have to say, the administration the president, himself and Fema [federal emergency management agency] administrator Craig Fugate have been outstanding with us so far,\" Christie told ABC's Good Morning America. \"We have a great partnership with them.\"</p> <p>Christie said Obama had called Monday night and offered to help in any way he could. New Jersey has now been declared a major disaster area, opening up government funding for recovery efforts.</p> <p>\"I want to thank the president personally for his personal attention to this,\" said Christie.</p> <p>On Fox News Christie was asked whether he would be touring the disaster-stricken state with Romney. \"I have no idea, nor am I the least bit concerned or interested,\" Christie said. \"I've got a job to do here in New Jersey that's much bigger than presidential politics, and I could care less about any of that stuff.\"</p> <p>\"I have a job to do,\" he added. \"I've got 2.4 million people out of power; I've got devastation on the shore; I've got floods in the northern part of my state. If you think right now I give a damn about presidential politics then you don't know me.\"</p> <p>Christie said Sandy had affected twice the number of people who were hit by last year's tropical storm Irene. He said it had taken eight days for the state to get back on track after Irene. \"This may take longer,\" he said. Christie said weather conditions were still so bad that the full extent of the damage would not be known for the next 24-48 hours.</p>",

South Africa thought we were joking. We didn't know anything about cables; I stayed up overnight reading about it on the internet.\"</p> <p>That was 2007, Ndemo said, and two years later <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/jul/23/east-africa-broadband-revolution\" title=\"\">Kenya landed the cable in record time</a>.</p> <p>Since then the country has gone from fewer than 6,000 broadband connections to 6m, and from fewer than 3m internet users to 18m.</p> <p>In Ndemo's grand vision, technology is not an optional luxury but rather central to 21st century education, development, economic growth \u2013 and ending Africa's reliance on foreign aid. He has ambitions for \"e-learning\" in schools across Kenya. \"After the cable landed, we gave unlimited capacity to all the universities.</p> <p>\"Access enables us to become more innovative. Broadband allows people to build things you never thought of. Four or five years ago you could not put the words 'Kenya', 'innovation' and 'research' in the same sentence.

He claims that <a href=\"https://opendata.go.ke\" title=\"\">Kenya is the first country in Africa to adopt open source data</a>, allowing researchers to study everything from health records to weather patterns.

I remember when we said we'd liberalise the sector, someone said: 'You won't come out alive.' But it was the best liberalisation ever.\"</p> <p>The government has sought to avoid the over-regulation that has hindered tech entrepreneurs in many other countries. The tech workforce also benefits from relatively strong schools and universities.</p> <p>There is a buzz and sense of possibility here. Kenya now has an estimated four million Facebook and three million Twitter users. In a few years mobile phone penetration has grown from less than 20% to 85%, driven by cheap tariffs and services such as five-year-old <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2007/mar/20/kenya.mobilephones\" title=\"\">M-Pesa</a>, which enables users to pay for goods by transferring money from one phone to another. About 17 million Kenyans, more than a third of the population, use M-Pesa and it is taking off around the world.</p> <p>The current <a href=\"http://www.ihub.co.ke\" title=\"\">nerve centre for Nairobi's tech community is the iHub</a>, which brings together entrepreneurs, hackers, designers and investors. It has generated 45 start-up companies since it was founded two years ago. Smart but not luxurious, on a typical day rows of young programmers sit on bright yellow chairs tapping at laptops.</p> <p>The iHub was founded by Erik Hersman, an American raised in Kenya and Sudan who blogs under the name \"White African\". Initial funding came from the success of Ushahidi, a website initially developed to map reports of post-election violence in Kenya which has become a platform for crowdsourcing and visualising data used in 156 countries.</p> <p>\"Ushahidi and M-Pesa both prove something,\" Hersman reflected, \"If you build it in Africa, it will work anywhere. There's a whole strata around that world that needs products that won't be built in Europe.\"</p> <p>The iHub has been visited by industry luminaries such as Marissa Mayer, the president of Yahoo, and Stephen Elop, the chief executive of Nokia. Hersman, 36, added: \"People from the US or Europe come to Africa because they think there's more upside. It's the last blue ocean for tech. It's untouched still.</p> <p>\"People here have more spending power now than 10 years ago. At the same time everything related to tech is decreasing costs. You have a great opportunity where people say, 'I can get in while it's still nascent'. It's still raw here.

  "<p>The future of drama in schools in England looks disturbingly bleak at the moment. Soon we may see the subject being cut from the curriculum altogether in many schools. There is no sign of any statutory drama curriculum in the offing, no secure entitlement for children to learn about and take part in regular drama lessons as part of a broad and balanced curriculum and no guarantee that they will be taught by specialist, qualified drama teachers.</p> <p>The most recent proof came earlier this month when the Department for Education released a report, <a href=\"https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/standard/publicationDetail/Page1/DFE-RR249\" title=\"The Effects of the English Baccalaureate\">The Effects of the English Baccalaureate</a>.</p> <p>One interesting effect, uncovered by the report, is the withdrawal of subjects that do not fit into, to use the DfE's words, \"a core of academic subjects; English, maths, history or geography, the sciences and a language.\"</p> <p>Of the teachers interviewed for the quantitative survey: \"Just over a quarter (27%) say that some courses have been withdrawn or failed to recruit enough pupils for the 2012/13 academic year due to the EBacc. The proportion of schools saying this has fallen significantly since 2011.\"</p> <p>The report goes on to say: \"The most commonly withdrawn subjects are drama and performing arts, which had been dropped in nearly a quarter of schools where a subject had been withdrawn (23%), followed by art (17%) and design technology (14%). BTECs have also seen a decline (dropped in 20% schools where subjects have been withdrawn).\"</p> <p>Just prior to the last election, Sir Jim Rose's ill-fated <a href=\"https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/standard/AbouttheDepartment/Page3/DCSF-00499-2009\" title=\"draft primary curriculum\">draft primary curriculum</a> was thrown out. He had drama at last clearly placed in \"understanding the arts\" as one of the four main art subjects (art, music, drama and dance), all of which were considered to be of equal status. The Tories and Lib Dems united, even then, to vote against this well-rounded curriculum that most primary teachers had welcomed.</p> <p>Later came Darren Henley's <a href=\"http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/teachingandlearning/curriculum/a00204067/henleyreview\" title=\"report on Cultural Education\">report on cultural education</a>. This followed his earlier report on music education which recommended drama and dance should be given equal arts status as curriculum subjects in their own right \u2013 as did the <a href=\"sirkenrobinson.com/skr/pdf/allourfutures.pdf\" title=\"All Our Futures report\">All Our Futures report</a> had also recommended this in 1999.</p> <p>However, Henley's important recommendation was selectively ignored and none of the initiatives that received Michael Gove's support following this report, were drama initiatives.</p> <p>Drama's position in education has been continuously damaged in many veiled ways since the election. When Gove surprisingly announced without consultation or warning, that schools should now be judged in relation to their performance in the English Baccalaureate subjects, I know of secondary schools that marginalised drama \u2013 placing it into after school study slots (competing with sports clubs).</p> <p>In June there was another giant blow for drama in the shape of the minimal draft primary curriculum. National Drama, the leading UK professional association for drama and theatre educators, had expected some involvement in drawing up the programmes of study for English but it seems a decision had already been made to cut drama from English. Even the speaking and listening framework within which drama sat was being silently axed, ignoring the fact that speaking and listening is the bedrock of English.</p> <p>This draft primary English curriculum will not be publicly consulted on now until at least January 2013. Why the long time lapse? Drama teachers through National Drama and other stakeholders (for example the NUT and the Cultural Learning Alliance) have asked for drama to be reinstated but it seems rather like Canute asking an ideological tidal wave to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cnut_the_Great\" title=\"change direction\">change direction</a>.</p> <p>It is likely that the English Baccalaureate Certificates (EBCs) will be pushed through (not yet even consulted on) and this will pave the way probably for an army of external arts providers (including theatre educators and drama workshop leaders), to start offering arts education deals to schools through Arts Council England's new regional bridging organisations. Creative Partnerships, Artsmark and the Arts Awards have all been fed into an enormous national database of artists who work in schools. Good artists working in schools is great but not as a replacement for specialist arts teachers. There is a world of difference between drama teachers working in a good partnership with visiting actors, theatre educators and drama workshop leaders and handing drama over to them.</p> <p>Hours before the Olympic ceremony (when many in England were distracted) the news was slipped through, that teachers in academies for some specialist subjects would no longer need QTS. Most artists (including theatre educators) do not have qualified teacher status. This is likely to be the thin end of a huge wedge, as so many schools are being baited or pushed into becoming academies. It opens the door for a large, cheaper, non-QTS drama workforce at a time of great unemployment and funding cuts in the arts world. Non-QTS drama personnel will understandably be ready and waiting in the wings to replace drama teachers, where schools decide they want to provide some form of drama.</p> <p>Can a worthwhile national curriculum drama programme of study be put in place if it relies on external providers to teach it? Can rigorous drama examinations survive in this context or will we have a weaker raft of examinations for the non-EBCs subjects? Will drama in schools become a provision and postcode lottery?</p> <p>It may be that Gove's understanding of drama in schools does not extend beyond performing school plays and reading Shakespeare. Presumably this would explain why he mistakenly thinks it can be parcelled out or actors brought in. He will not discuss pedagogy in relation to the curriculum and yet drama teachers in schools are a powerful and ever present pedagogical resource for all teachers. Many are skilled at supporting colleagues to teach other subjects through drama and there is much evidence to show the positive impact drama can have on raising standards and improving key competencies, for example the <a href=\"http://www.d4lc.org.uk\" title=\"Drama for Learning and Creativity (D4LC) initiative\">Drama for Learning and Creativity (D4LC) initiative</a>.</p> <p>Ironically, countries that do not have drama teachers with QTS and only have visiting drama pedagogues have looked enviously towards England. The ministry of education in Singapore (which has a new curriculum drama officer) is sending a visiting arts delegation across to look at drama teaching in English schools next July. Let's hope we still have something to show them. Meanwhile Australia has its first ever national curriculum with drama as an equal status arts subject. New Zealand, Ontario, Ireland, and Northern Ireland all have drama in their curriculums and within the last few weeks Iceland put drama into its national curriculum for the first time. Finland may soon follow suit.

  "<p><strong>Was it really a hurricane? </strong>No, by the time it made landfall in the US&#xa0;it had been reclassified to a post-tropical storm.</p> <p><strong>Why was it called </strong><a href=\"http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/tcp/Storm-naming.html\" title=\"\"><strong>Sandy</strong></a><strong>? That seems a very fey 1920s name for a hurricane/tropical storm.</strong> There are six lists of names for tropical cyclones in the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico and North Atlantic, with names chosen mainly for their pithiness. Sandy was on the 2012 list. But once a storm causes destruction on this scale, it is delisted. Like Katrina and Mitch, we have heard the last of Sandy.</p> <p><strong>How great was the death toll? </strong>In the US the number is put at 18 (though that may rise) \u2013 about the same number that died in the <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/news/the-great-storm-of-1987-25-years-on\" title=\"\">great storm of 1987</a> in the UK. Sandy has killed several times that number in Cuba and Haiti. Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005, led to more than 1,800 deaths.</p> <p><strong>How will Sandy affect the presidential election? </strong>Obama hopes that by flying back to Washington ahead of a rally in Florida and declaring a disaster, he will look presidential. Pundits reckon the storm has blown away&#xa0;any momentum his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, might have had. But it is also likely to deter early voters from turning out, and they tend to be disproportionately Democrat supporters.</p> <p><strong>Might the election have to </strong><a href=\"http://www.nj.com/us-politics/index.ssf/2012/10/could_hurricane_sandy_delay_th.html\" title=\"\"><strong>be delayed</strong></a><strong>? </strong>According to constitutional experts, this is a \"legal black hole\". It has never happened, and law-makers are eager to avoid a postponement, but some experts suggest states do have the right to delay if holding the election on the designated day (6 November) is problematic. If any did so, however, they could open themselves up to challenges by Congress. Given that there is still a week to go and the level of destruction appears to be containable, the odds are that no state will opt out.</p> <p><strong>Why did the lights in the </strong><a href=\"http://thewall.com/topics/51127-while-almost-everyone-else-is-dark-the-lights-are\" title=\"\"><strong>Goldman Sachs building</strong></a><strong> stay on while New York City hospital had to be evacuated when its back-up power system failed? </strong>Because Goldman Sachs is a global investment banking and securities firm, and a hospital is \u2013 in the last analysis \u2013 just a hospital.</p> <p><strong>What's happening to </strong><a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/10/29/how_sandy_hits_the_homeless/\" title=\"\"><strong>the homeless</strong></a><strong>? </strong>The New York City Department of Homeless Services relocated nine homeless centres, evacuated more than 1,000 people and made strenuous efforts to encourage the use of shelters, but some of New York's 50,000-plus homeless population preferred to take their chance on the streets, perhaps relying on reflected light from Goldman Sachs Tower.</p> <p><strong>Did the </strong><a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/10/30/uk-storm-sandy-crane-idUKBRE89S13X20121030\" title=\"\"><strong>dangling crane</strong></a><strong> next to the luxury apartment building near Central Park ever collapse? </strong>When last seen, it was still dangling. </p> <p><strong>Did no one think that a 50-metre-high crane might pose a risk? </strong>Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the crane had been inspected and deemed not to be a risk, but that God moved in mysterious ways. \"Just because it was inspected, that doesn't mean God doesn't do things or that metal doesn't fail.\"</p> <p><strong>What will the disaster cost? </strong>Storm damage is put at about $20bn, of which $8bn will be insured losses. Hefty sums, but only about a quarter of the cost of the damage wrought by Katrina.</p> <p><strong>How will the US economy cope? </strong>Rather well, bizarrely. Destruction is ultimately thought to be good for business, producing investment \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.680news.com/business/article/416736--sandy-may-slow-us-economy-in-short-term-but-areas-like-construction-will-benefit-in-long-run\" title=\"\">especially in reconstruction</a> \u2013 that more than offsets what has been lost. Analysts say that in the long term Sandy will give a $40bn boost to the economy. At a macroeconomic level, God does indeed move in mysterious ways.</p> <p><strong>How will the economy of Haiti, which was also battered by Sandy, cope? </strong>The absence of tweeters, bloggers and corporate analysts in Port-au-Prince makes that difficult to answer.</p>",
  "<p>Despite its suburban ideals and cultural dreams of white picket fences, America is a dangerous place. Earthquakes are a part of life for citizens of Californian mega-cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco. In the south-west, gigantic wildfires tear across the landscapes each summer. The midwestern heartland, often held up as the quintessential symbol of small-town American values, is in fact prone to lethal tornadoes. The south \u2013 and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/30/sandy-superstorm-flooding-power-cuts\">now, it seems, New York City, too</a> \u2013 is regularly visited by devastating hurricanes.</p> <p>All of these various forms of natural disaster produce in extremis events for those impacted and give us a glimpse into the true character of the nation and its millions of citizens. The result seems to be that Americans often brush themselves off, put their shoulders to the wheel and quickly start to rebuild. They reach out, help each other, and triumph.</p> <p>Whether it's a town devastated by a tornado or a community burnt to the ground by wildfire, there seems a display of pioneer spirit that has the clean-up underway even before the disaster is over. In the US, unlike many other parts of the world, there is often a focus on creating something new out of the wreckage. The country is notoriously forward-looking and, in the US, rebuilding does not always mean restoring.</p> <p>Just look at the town of Greensburg in Kansas. It was basically <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_2007_tornado_outbreak\">wiped out by a tornado in 2007</a> that destroyed 95% of its buildings. Five years later, Greensburg has rebuilt itself as one of the most environmentally sensitive \"green\" communities in the country. Each new city building is built to <a href=\"https://new.usgbc.org/leed/rating-systems\">LEED platinum standards</a>: the first city in America to do so. Out of the disaster, Greensburg was built as something entirely new. How very American.</p> <p>Indeed, in disaster America tends to harmonise two themes, which, in its day-to-day politics, always seem so separate: the role of the individual and the role of government. During an election, those two seem locked in mortal combat, destined to forever fight via their proxies of the Democratic and Republican parties. In disaster, however, they often go hand in hand.</p> <p>No wonder the late great writer Kurt Vonnegut, often held up as America's conscience, praised volunteer firefighters in so many of his books. After all, the small-town firefighting department is an expression of the community as a whole, as it needs to respond to catastrophe. But it's also made up of individual volunteers.</p> <p>\"I can think of no more stirring symbol of man's humanity to man than a fire engine,\" Vonnegut wrote in his classic Sirens of Titan.</p> <p>That is playing out now in New Jersey right now in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. Governor Chris Christie \u2013 usually no friend of big government \u2013 is deploying all the many powers at his disposal to help his fellow citizens. Always so conservative when it comes to respecting individual liberty, Christie has issued mandatory evacuations and welcomed the proffered hand of Washington federal aid.</p> <p>\"I have to say, the administration, the president, himself and Fema Administrator Craig Fugate have been outstanding with us so far,\" he told a TV interviewer Tuesday morning. </p> <p>There is a Ronald Reagan gag trotted out all the time by Republican politicians. \"The nine most terrifying words in the English language are: 'I'm from the government and I'm here to help,'\" he quipped. It always gets a laugh. Except when disaster actually strikes. Trying telling that joke to anyone in trouble right now in New Jersey, New York, Virginia or Maryland. They won't be laughing with you. Not even the Republicans among them.</p> <p>Indeed, the main recent catastrophe where America failed to step up to the plate \u2013 the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina \u2013 was seen mostly as a failure of too little government help. President George W Bush and his reviled Fema boss Michael Brown were lambasted for not doing enough: for government <em>inaction</em>. The hero of the hour became the National Guard, which swept into the disaster zone to take action: again, a bunch of reservist volunteers who make up a part of government.</p> <p>To see this synthesis of the American individual and American government, you don't always have to look at outright disasters. New York City regularly deals with the sort of blizzard that brings weeks of havoc to countries like Britain. Yet, in New York, the streets are rapidly swept clean and the city shrugs off the storm and gets back to work remarkably quickly.</p> <p>One thing a foreigner always notices is how each shopkeeper or homeowner rapidly comes out and sweeps away the snow outside their building. They are required to do so by law and it does an amazing job of dealing with any blizzard. Each person salts and clears just the patch in front of their building. No more and no less. It's an act of individualism. Yet, it is mandated by government (you can get a ticket for not doing it), and the result is that each individual acts together, as a community, and the whole city leaps back to life.</p> <p>It seems that disaster and crisis provides an opportunity for Americans to blend together their individualism and their communal instincts into something that really works. But if you look at the headlines of the warring political campaigns of the 2012 election, it remains a distant dream for more normal times.</p>",
  "<p>A fairly miserable flu is preventing me from writing much today, so instead I will point you to several items I think are worth reading:</p> <p><strong>(1)</strong> The devastation from Hurricane Sandy is remarkable. The Guardian has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/30/sandy-superstorm-flooding-power-cuts\">live, ongoing coverage here</a>, while Salon has <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/10/30/sandys_shocking_aftermath/\">compiled a slideshow</a> of some of the most extraordinary photos of the post-storm destruction. There are all sorts of shocking photos being circulated, such as <a href=\"http://twitpic.com/b8rz19\">this one</a> posted by The Atlantic of the destruction in Breezy Point, NY.</p> <p><strong>(2)</strong> Economics Professor Robert Prasch has <a href=\"http://translationexercises.wordpress.com/2012/10/29/the-progressive-retreat-from-obama-who-is-to-blame/\">a provocative look</a> at President Obama's first term from a progressive perspective. On the same blog, Philosophy Professor and feminist Falguni Sheth <a href=\"http://translationexercises.wordpress.com/2012/10/24/emily-hausers-disgusting-indifference-to-women-of-color/\">looks at Obama's record vis-a-vis women</a>.</p> <p><strong>(3)</strong> Oliver Stone is releasing <a href=\"http://books.simonandschuster.com/Untold-History-of-the-United-States/Peter-Kuznick/9781451613513?intcmp=l_pl&amp;cp_type=l_pl_books_hub_coming_soon&amp;prefd=l_pl_9781451613513\">a new book</a>, entitled \"The Untold History of the United States\", which highlights key facts in US history over the last century that have been largely ignored or affirmatively distorted. I've read parts of the book and recommend it highly (a summary of his chapter on the Obama presidency <a href=\"http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=F58D791C-7FFF-42B2-9A65-C4E932194C31\">is here</a>). Beginning 12 November, Showtime is broadcasting <a href=\"http://www.sho.com/sho/oliver-stones-untold-history-of-the-united-states/home\">a 10-part documentary to accompany the book</a>; I've seen the first four installments and cannot recommend it highly enough.</p> <p><strong>(4)</strong> On Saturday, Salon <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/10/27/the_progressive_case_against_obama/\">published \"The Progressive Case Against Obama\" by Matt Stoller</a> - the former Democratic Congressional staffer and MSNBC producer, currently on Russell Brand's FX show - which offered a scathing indictment of Obama's domestic record and explained why Stoller believes that a vote for a third-party is the optimal course of action. Stoller's piece predictably generated intense reaction: it has been recommended on Facebook more than 13,000 times and has been <a href=\"http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/10/third-party-nihilism-the-arguments-can-always-get-worse\">viciously attacked</a> in many precincts. That's all perfectly legitimate: he's making a provocative argument that is threatening to Obama's re-election and so it's perfectly understandable that it has been aggressively critiqued.</p> <p>But the well-read pro-Obama blog Balloon-Juice went far beyond legitimate, aggressive critique. Based on that article, the blog <a href=\"http://www.balloon-juice.com/2012/10/27/10-days\">publicly smeared Stoller as a racist without the slightest basis</a>. The entirety of its smear, contained in a playful \"ps\", is here:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"ps: <a href=\"http://www.balloon-juice.com/2012/10/27/they-just-never-stop/\">John was spot on</a> about Stoller. We are plagued with self-important white males pretending to speak for progressives even as they work overtime to block and damage any liberal progress. It is hard for me to read Stoller and not wonder if his real problem with Barack Obama <a href=\"http://www.charter.net/news/read.php?rip_id=%3CDA25OTHO0%40news.ap.org%3E&amp;ps=1018\">is this</a> and not any policy. Assholes like him make the GOTV effort even more important.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The link over the phrase \"is this\" is to a recently released poll from AP finding that a majority of Americans \"harbor prejudice against blacks\" and that this biogtry could impede Obama's re-election. In other words, claimed this Balloon-Juice writer, Stoller's decision not to vote for Obama is based not on any genuine policy objections (as he claims), but rather on the fact that Obama is black and Stoller is a racist.</p> <p>Amazingly, when numerous readers objected to this smear, the Balloon-Juice writer - deep in the comment section - <a href=\"http://www.balloon-juice.com/2012/10/27/10-days/#comment-3890199\">repeatedly confessed</a> that he <a href=\"http://www.balloon-juice.com/2012/10/27/10-days/#comment-3890312\">had no basis whatsoever</a> for making that accusation: </p> <blockquote> <p><br>\"You have a point. It could just be that Stoller is a complete idiot and he comes to his destructive dribble on the basis of his ego and ignorance alone. I do not deny that possibility. It was snark to link to the AP poll on the growing racist attitudes of a majority of white Americans. . . . </p> <p>\"Is Stoller one of them? I really do not know, but it is pretty clear that he has a visceral hatred of President Obama that would make a Teabagger blush. Perhaps his anger is all based on policy. It is possible, but it is not unreasonable to think that some other factors are also influencing his opinions.</p> <p>\"Still, I'll give you the point and accept that fact that it is possible that Matt Stoller is simply a self-absorbed asshole who is too busy thinking about his own 'brilliance' to consider race in his thinking. . . . </p> <p>\"It is also a fact that a decent number of white folks who call themselves progressives have racist attitudes. I suggested that that could be an alternative explanation for Stoller's idiocy. It was snark and troll bait. I do not know the truth of Stoller's attitudes about race and neither do do you.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Despite those confessions, the public smearing of Stoller as a racist remains on that blog, completely unretracted and uncorrected (the fact that Stoller echoed and/or relied heavily in making his arguments on non-white and non-male writers like <a href=\"http://translationexercises.wordpress.com/2012/10/24/emily-hausers-disgusting-indifference-to-women-of-color/\">Sheth</a> and <a href=\"http://blackagendareport.com/content/freedom-rider-not-voting-obama\">Margaret Kimberley of the Black Agenda Report</a> is revealingly ignored).</p> <p>There are few things more reckless and disgusting than publicly smearing someone as a racist - easily one of the worst things you can say about someone in America, for very good reason - purely for partisan gain. That's especially true when you are well aware that you have no basis for the accusation.</p> <p>For years, neocons did the same thing with \"anti-semitism\" charges. They seized on a real and serious problem - anti-semitism - and converted it into an exploitative, opportunistic weapon to punish those who deviated from their political views, particularly on Israel. The worst part of that behavior - aside from ruining people's reputations by casting them as bigots without any cause - is that it dilutes the power of that term and makes it no longer effective to use when it actually appears. </p> <p>That is precisely what spouting <strong>knowingly baseless </strong> accusations of racism achieves. Obviously, racism plays a substantial role in motivating <em>some </em>of the hostility toward the first African-American president, just as anti-semitism plays a role in <em>some</em> hostility toward Israel. That's precisely why it's so vital to avoid casually exploiting those terms for gross partisan opportunism: because people will stop taking the terms seriously when they genuinely arise. </p> <p>This happens often, but this case is particularly egregious given the accuser's admissions of baselessness in the comment section, combined with the total lack of retraction or correction by that blog.</p> <p><strong>(5)</strong> The New Republic's Jeffrey Rosen, the consummate establishment-revering centrist, <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/blog/plank/109359/the-supreme-court-exposes-the-obama-administrations-circular-logic-wiretapping#\">reviews the Supreme Court's oral argument yesterday</a> in the constitutional challenge brought by the ACLU against the FISA Amendments Act, the 2008 statute enacted by a large bipartisan majority that, in essence, legalized many of the Bush/Cheney warrantless eavesdropping powers. In particular, Rosen reviews the warped tactic of the Obama DOJ to simultaneously (1) keep the list of eavesdropping targets secret and (2) argue that an individual unable to prove that they've been targeted by the eavesdropping is barred from challenging its constitutionality: an obvious Catch-22 that removes secret executive branch actions from judicial review - i.e., from the rule of law - and has been used repeatedly by the Bush and Obama DOJs to shield its conduct from scrutiny.</p> <p><strong>(6)</strong> An <a href=\"http://www.tinyrevolution.com/mt/archives/000742.html\">old post</a> of Jonathan Schwarz's, from 2006, documents how frequently - really, reflexively - western invaders claim that their invasions are for the good of the invaded populations and are even called for by those populations. Related to that, and based in part on Schwarz's work, I gave a 30-minute speech a few months ago at the University of Chicago on the fraudulent concept called \"humanitarian war\":</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MMirTxSlhBA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MMirTxSlhBA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>(7)</strong> I have a few speaking events coming up this month.

  "<p>I was fascinated by Hanna Rosin's article, Men: an endangered species? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/30/hanna-rosin-end-men-extract?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">(19 October)</a>. Rosin perceptively catalogued the changing roles of men and women both in the economy and in the home. But what I missed was any consideration of the effect that these changes have on children: the one group in our society that is voiceless and invisible. From the womb onwards it is the voices of men and women that we hear, not the voices of the children.</p> <p>The facts were spelled out by President Obama himself, a man who grew up without a father. In a speech on Father's Day 2008, he said: \"Children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime; nine times more likely to drop out of school and 20 times more likely to end up in prison.\" Fatherlessness is a serious problem in the newly emerging society so expertly mapped by Rosin. And for many children, actual fatherlessness is compounded by functional motherlessness as children are shuttled from bed to the childminder to school, back to childminder and back to bed.</p> <p>I am not arguing for the hopeless policy of putting the clock back, but for a more complete understanding of the roles of men and women that includes the needs and rights, not only of the adults, but of the people least able to make their voices heard, their children.<br><strong>Martin Down</strong><br>Witney, UK</p> <p>\u2022 What is Hanna Rosin saying? A number of things: a) women are making progress in all fields; b) men have difficulty coping with the change; c) in general, this is good. She is generally right \u2013 especially about the last. We certainly need more women in top places \u2013 both in politics and in the economy.</p> <p>But why are women so adaptable and men so inflexible? Rosin says that the nature v nurture question on this is unanswerable, but it is clear she is leaning towards the latter explanation.</p> <p>Alas, it turns out that although she mentions evolutionary psychology her view of it is rather simplistic. Evolutionary psychology points to the interaction between genes and the environment. There is a spectrum of traits and behaviours \u2013 from ones that are almost exclusively determined by genes to ones almost exclusively determined by society.</p> <p>Violence is one of the former. Rosin says that women are becoming more aggressive and even violent. Are they? Are we to assume they are going to overtake men at some point \u2013 as they have in the field of academic success? I do not think so.</p> <p>Mate preferences fall somewhere in between. Rosin says that there is an international market for spouses, with men looking for women with more traditional views. I would like to argue that the main reason behind this market is different: men use their higher status to find younger women from poorer countries.</p> <p>And what about women? Why is there no similar market for men \u2013 with the modern, successful women looking for different men? Could it be that despite their success, women are still looking for someone swooping in on a white horse?</p> <p>Rosin's last point that there is no \"natural order\", only the way things are, is the perfect expression of the moralistic fallacy. It suggests that things can change in any direction we would like \u2013 without constraints.</p> <p>Yet as the great EO Wilson once said, \"nature holds us on a leash\". There may be no natural order but there are natural predispositions. Would it not be great if culture and&#xa0;socialisation could rid us of our&#xa0;sweet tooth? Think about this next time you walk past an ice-cream shop.<br><strong>Nick Michelioudakis</strong><br>Athens, Greece</p> <p><strong>Cuban missile crisis</strong></p> <p>I was disappointed to read Richard Gott's article on the Cuban missile crisis <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/12/what-cuban-missile-crisis?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">(How Cuba won the missile crisis, 19 October)</a>, even though I agreed with everything he wrote. The problem was what he left out, which concerns US activities the previous year. The standard US account blames the Russians for an act of aggression when they began to install missile bases in Cuba in 1962. Kennedy is then presented as a heroic statesman who takes the world to the brink of nuclear disaster, but manages to avert a third world war by sheer determination.</p> <p>What the US account conveniently omits is the installation of US missile bases in Turkey and Italy the previous year. The Russians had protested about those installations \u2013 which are roughly the same distance as that from Cuba to the US. They described it as an act of aggression because it destabilised the balance of power between the two military systems. The US ignored those protests and went ahead. Seen in that context, the Cuban missile crisis was caused by the US, not by Russia.</p> <p>Luckily for all of us, reason won through and the crisis was resolved. The US achieved a propaganda victory and was able to peddle its distorted account of events. Anyone writing about those events should make sure to provide the proper context, to avoid perpetuating a misleading account.<br><strong>Les Reid</strong><br>Edinburgh, UK</p> <p>\u2022 At least Richard Gott does not say that the Cubans won the missile crisis. I initially sympathised with the revolution. But the sad fact is that Cubans had great freedom of inquiry and expression under Batista. Dissenters did not physically rot in harsh jails. Castro kept his freedom because of Batista's leniency.</p> <p>The American policy towards Cuba has only a marginal effect on its economy. The sad fact is that under Batista the Cuban economy was among the best in Latin America rather than among the worst under Castro. I regret that Kennedy double-crossed the Cuban exiles at the time of the Bay of Pigs and set them up for failure.<br><strong>Morton A Kaplan</strong><br>Chicago, Illinois, US</p> <p><strong>Hard burden of proof</strong></p> <p>The Jimmy Savile case has highlighted how the odds are stacked against victims. Jonathan Freedland describes \"the curious protection granted to so many rapists: the refusal to believe the victims\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/12/evil-jimmy-savile-not-alone\" title=\"\">(This evil is not just one man's, 19 October)</a>.</p> <p>Not only is this the case, but legally the burden of the proof is on the victim. Rape, like any crime, has to be proven \"beyond reasonable doubt\", failing which the accused is to be considered innocent. But what exactly does this mean?</p> <p>That hard evidence is required? Or that the victim's side of the story is more plausible than that of the accused? DNA testing is far from systematic; surveillance cameras are usually not available.</p> <p>Having served recently on jury service without much guidance as to how to interpret \"beyond reasonable doubt\", several jurors were unwilling to return a guilty verdict in the absence of hard proof. For any rape that takes place without witnesses the legal system makes it extremely difficult to reach a verdict of guilty.<br><strong>Maroussia Rochigneux</strong><br>Bristol, UK</p> <p><strong>Pakistan: it's complicated</strong></p> <p>It is disappointing to find in the article about Malala Yousafzai, shot by the Taliban in Swat valley <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/15/malala-yousafzai-pakistan?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">(Anger as Taliban shoot girl who spoke out, 19 October)</a>, a lack of understanding of the political forces that shape the interlinked conflicts in Pakistan. The article refers to a solidarity rally in Karachi that 40,000 people attended. Pakistani papers reported that this was a rally held by the MQM (Muttahida Quami Movement), which is in a violent conflict in Karachi with the Pashtun party, the AMP (the Taliban are Pashtun).</p> <p>The solidarity rally, then, was not simply a spontaneous show of solidarity by Karachi-ites, as suggested by the Guardian's article, but a calculated game of political point-scoring between two political parties engaged in a very sophisticated kind of gang war. The solidarity rally was less about Malala Yousafzai and more about the conflict in Karachi.</p> <p>This is a significant misrepresentation of events.<br><strong>Antonia Settle</strong><br>Brunswick, Victoria, Australia</p> <p><strong>Hypocrisy over China</strong></p> <p>I was startled by the sheer hypocritical claims made by official US institutions against Chinese companies as emphasised by Isabel Hilton <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/10/huawei-china-difference\" title=\"\">(China is indeed different, October 19)</a>. Huawei is alleged to have close links to the military, but what about the US \"military-industrial complex\" as famously depicted by President Dwight Eisenhower?</p> <p>Chinese businesses may lack accounting transparency but what about the vast sub-prime mortgage swindle recently orchestrated by American finance, as well as the Greece public funds fiddling?</p> <p>We have all been exploiting the Chinese workforce for years. Without a bit of honesty and objectivity coming from our self-righteous nations, tensions could only grow with China, the 21st-century ambitious giant, which, in any case, will remain unshaken.<br><strong>Marc Jachym</strong><br>Paris, France</p> <p><strong>Briefly</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Regarding efforts to stop Iran from&#xa0;acquiring nuclear weapons <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/05/iranian-currency-crisis-mahmoud-ahmadinejad?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">(12 October)</a>: would you expect the Hatfields to accept a treaty in which they were only allowed to have knives while the McCoys were allowed to possess guns?<br><strong>Arthur J Weiss</strong><br>Little Deer Isle, Maine, US</p> <p>\u2022 The US electorate is swayed easily by shrill histrionics <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/21/obama-romney-final-fortnight-campaign\" title=\"\">(Obama and Romney tied in polls, 26 October)</a>. I tend to leap to the conclusion that we live in a brekekekexcoaxcoaxarchy (a la Aristophanes), ie, rule by whichever bullfrog and his chorus \"croak\" the loudest in the frog pond.

People are without power, and a few trees are down, but they have homes.</p> <p>In Loch Arbour, a tiny community neighbouring Asbury Park, it's a different story. A row of six houses that once proudly faced out to the Atlantic has been decimated by the storm.</p> <p>One of the homes, a two-storey wood-panelled building painted pink, is missing almost its entire ground floor. On one side the front wall has been swept away. Inside furniture is entirely missing too, replaced by three feet of sand. The back wall is also gone, with the surge having swept clean through the house and across two gardens behind. The home only has one full supporting wall left and has been cordoned off by police.</p> <p>Bill Gleeson, a funeral home director, owns the home next door. He's lived there with his family since 1986. His home has been more fortunate, most of the walls are intact, although inside there are water marks up to 5ft high in places. The floor is covered in a thick layer of sand.</p> <p>\"The water just washed right through,\" Gleeson said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AdamGabbatt/status/263388826079207425\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Bill Gleeson's house in Loch Arbour suffered severe damage. 3ft of sand left inside. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23sandy\">#sandy</a> cc @<a href=\"https://twitter.com/matthewwells\">matthewwells</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/4nJdinLt\" title=\"http://twitter.com/AdamGabbatt/status/263388826079207425/photo/1\">twitter.com/AdamGabbatt/st\u2026</a></p>&mdash; Adam Gabbatt (@AdamGabbatt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamGabbatt/status/263388826079207425\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-30T21:16:04+00:00\">October 30, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>In Loch Arbour, West Rekeda, 47, manager of Kassin Beach club, also said the ocean \u201ccame right through the building\u201d.</p> <p>The club is closer to the beach than the houses. There's not much left of it. The back wall is still intact but the interior of the one-storey white building has been swept away. Individual planks are missing from the large blue porch, leaving it looking like a cattle grid. All the walls at the front of the structure are missing.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s sad.

The main problem for the fire department on Tuesday afternoon was towing cars off the beach, as gawkers headed down to the coast to survey the damage.</p> <p>\"Extremely windy but we were pretty blessed not to get the rain because that would have made it a lot worse,\" said Virginia Ferraro, whose husband was engaged in digging out a fire rescue van that had got stuck trying to help out the driver of a white sedan.</p> <p>\"It was crazy windy,\" she said, but she suffered no damage to her property. \"But they warned us, they did a good job of warning us.\"</p> <p>Ferraro didn't have power, but had made chilli on the stove. \"It was pretty good,\" she said.</p> <p><em>Adam Gabbatt</em></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-30T21:33:58.846Z\">at 9.33pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50903c96b57986a0fe1d497e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-30T20:46:14.415Z\">8.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Guardian's Alexander Hotz takes a walk down Van Brunt Street in<strong> Red Hook, Brooklyn:</strong></p> <p>All businesses along the main commercial drag of Van Brunt Street were closed as owners struggled to clean out their buildings and restore power.

He had been planning to hold events in Ohio but will remain at White House.</p> <p>In some ways \u2013 a big way \u2013 the storm is the biggest campaign event of all, an unexpected bonus for Obama. It allows him to appear presidential and casts Mitt Romney in a bit part .</p> <p>The praise from New Jersey governor Chris Christie for Obama over his handling of Sandy has been a big boost. The Romney campaign must be wondering what on earth Christie was thinking. It is one thing to acknowledge help from the White House but did he really have to go far as to describe this as \"outstanding\".</p> <p>Romney is the one on the defensive, reporters watching for whether he appearance at relief event in Ohio veers into campaigning.</p> <p>I spent an hour this morning speaking to Obama campaign workers on the ground in Iowa and other swing states in the Mid-West and West and they are unaffected by Sandy. They are going ahead as normal with campaign plans, stepping up, as scheduled, getting out the votes. This effort will intensify over the weekend, with volunteers working three-hour shifts from 8.00 am on Saturday through to 9pm and from noon to 9pm on Sunday.&#xa0;Predictions among some Obama campaign workers on the ground that Romney has North Carolina in bag, and will take Florida, Virginia and Colorado. Obama, they hope, will take Ohio, Iowa, Nevada and New Hampshire.</p> <p>Mitt Romney is to take a gamble by resuming campaigning on Wednesday. He has scheduled several campaign events in Florida: in Tampa, Coral Gables and Jacksonville. The danger for him is that people might not yet be ready by then to make the switch from focus on the storm to politics, and his speeches on the campaign trail may look petty compared with Obama still dealing with the storm aftermath from the White House.</p> <p><em>Ewen MacAskill in Washington DC</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-9b9c90e3-e0fb-455a-b23b-6a335342091f\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/30/1351615172227/2cbffcf6-7e87-4a88-8e37-9f09b6e4dd8f-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Barack Obama receives an update on the ongoing response to Hurricane Sandy on Tuesday, in the Situation Room of the White House.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama receives an update on the ongoing response to Hurricane Sandy on Tuesday, in the Situation Room of the White House.

At the 72nd street entrance a pair of workmen with a green truck could be seen clearing the road on Central Park drive of tree limbs ripped down by the storm.</p> <p>But the park entrances remained firmly sealed both to traffic and pedestrians, not that it stopped a few hardy \u2013 some might say foolish \u2013 joggers from trying to gain access. Four runners looked around surreptitiously as they squeezed around the metal barrier blocking the road that runs through the park at 79th street.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re idiots, some people just don\u2019t realise they are taking their lives in their own hands,\u201d said a park worker shortly after escorting a sheepish looking jogger over a low wall and onto the pavement of Fifth Avenue. \u201cThere is a lot of damage, a lot of limbs of trees down, and there could still be a lot that come down as the day goes on.

Amongst them were William and Nadine Buffin, from Lyon in France, who had made the trek from their hotel on 32nd street in the hope of finding at least one of New York\u2019s famous tourist attractions open. \u201c We arrived on Sunday and this is not quite what we were expecting,\u201d Mr Buffin said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re supposed to fly home on Thursday \u2013 hopefully, depending on whether the airport is open.\u201d Asked what they planned to do next he said they would probably walk down to China Town. \u201cBut maybe there is nothing open there either\u2026\u201d</p> <p><em>Jamie Wilson</em></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-30T16:19:20.427Z\">at 4.19pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-508ff675b57986a0fe1d4964\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-30T15:52:00.554Z\">3.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Tunnels flooded</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The <strong>Brooklyn-Battery tunnel</strong>, which connects lower Manhattan and Brooklyn, is completely flooded at its entrance near Battery Park. Water and debris has choked the entrance right up to the tunnel's roof, with flotsam bobbing just beneath a sign warning drivers that the clearance height is 12 ft 7ins.</p> <p>A maintenance truck lies almost entirely submerged on the sliproad down to the tunnel. There was no sign of the water receding in the 20 minutes I spent there.</p> <p>Many buildings in this southernmost part of Manhattan were inundated by the storm surge. Along Water Street, which runs parallel to the East River waterfront, a fire crew surveyed the damage to their station. Windows were smashed and sandbags proved useless against the flow of water. Inside, uniforms were strewn about the floor, which was still damp.</p> <p>Mandatory evacuations were in place in this part of the city, one of the most vulnerable places to a storms surge.</p> <p>The water poured into the entrance to the Whitehall ferry terminal, which provides a connection to Staten Island.</p> <p>An MTA employee told the Guardian that at 7.30am water was \u201cup to the platform\u201d in the terminal. He said some of the tunnels running under the East River from Manhattan to Brooklyn were entirely full of water, from roof to floor. The MTA was unable to pump out water quick enough because equipment was affected by power outages.</p> <p>Most people had heeded the extensive warnings and these streets were largely clear before the storm hit on Monday. But some people were caught out by the severity of the flooding. A new-looking white BMW 3 series car had been carried down a street close to the ferry terminal and dumped askew, partly on the road and partly on the sidewalk. A door had apparently been forced open by the storm, and pools of dank-smelling water had accumulated in the passenger footwells.</p> <p>Most of lower Manhattan below 24th Street was without power Tuesday morning. In Midtown, the damage was less from flooding and more from high winds, with branches and other foliage lining the roads. In some places there had been minor scaffolding collapses and tiles had smashed to the ground.</p> <p>There is a large police presence: squad cars with flashing lights were crawling around Manhattan, although the clean-up operation did not seem to have kicked in by 11am and the police seemed mostly to be reporting damage and acting as reassurance.</p> <p><em>Adam Gabbatt</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-ff0efab7-a541-4d26-beb3-e07281a88354\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/30/1351612279741/95325abd-cb27-487d-9737-475f82845650-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Hurricane Sandy floods reach the street level of the flooded Battery Park underpass, which leads to the Brooklyn-Battery tunnel in New York.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Water reaches the street level of the flooded Battery Park underpass, which leads to the Brooklyn-Battery tunnel in New York.

Riverside Park had a few downed trees, but the inconvenience was more caused by the downed branches, that numerous joggers jumped over as they went for their morning runs.</p> <p>Doormen and supers were hard at work hosing leaves from the sidewalks and curbs in front of their buildings. Some even had the time to put up Halloween decorations in their buildings lobbies.</p> <p>On Broadway, some stores lost their signs, which blew off in the wind.

This morning the man once seen as a likely Republican vice presidential pick has called president Barack Obama \u201coutstanding\u201d and blasted suggestions that his state would make a great photo op for Mitt Romney.</p> <p>New Jersey has been hit hard, three people have lost their lives so far to the storm, 2.4m people are out of power and levees have broken in northern New Jersey leaving at least four towns with up to 6ft of water. And Christie has no time for politics.</p> <p>\u201cI have to say, the administration, the president, himself and FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate have been outstanding with us so far,\u201d Christie said on ABC\u2019s Good Morning America. \u201cWe have a great partnership with them.\u201d</p> <p>Obama called on Christie Monday night, the governor said, and offered to help in any way he could. New Jersey has now been declared a major disaster area, opening up government funding for recovery efforts.</p> <p>\u201cI want to thank the president personally for his personal attention to this,\u201d said Christie.</p> <p>On Fox News host Steve Doocy made a pitch for a Christie/Romney photo op in some disaster-stricken New Jersey&#xa0;\u201cOver the last couple of months, you have appeared throughout the country, governor, on behalf of Mitt Romney,\u201d Doocy said. \u201cWe hear that perhaps Mr Romney may do some storm-related events. Is there any possibility that governor Romney may go to New Jersey to tour some of the damage with you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have no idea, nor am I the least bit concerned or interested,\u201d Christie snapped. \u201cI\u2019ve got a job to do here in New Jersey that\u2019s much bigger than presidential politics and I could care less about any of that stuff.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have a job to do,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ve got 2.4 million people out of power, I\u2019ve got devastation on the shore, I\u2019ve got floods in the northern part of my state.

The rivers are going down. In general the departments have put down the vigilance, it was red, now it is normal. They are trying to repair the roads and bridges that collapsed.</p> </blockquote> <p>He said the most serious impact of the storm had been on agriculture - the loss of crops and livestock. Christian Aid was going out at the moment to see what the state and other organisations were not able to provide, \u201cand to provide what is missing\u201d. They would be helping repair houses, replace livestock and provide seeds.</p> <p>Asked about the government\u2019s response, he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To be honest I think this time they did what they could, because they managed to put more than 20,000 people in temporary shelter, but in total you have 200,000 people that were affected by Sandy. That means there is a huge gap. We think we could provide some support to complement what they are doing.</p> </blockquote> <p>What could the government do differently?</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Christian Aid [is pushing] the government to take the environment situation more seriously, because if the country had the right trees, the right forests in place, I think that could help. It\u2019s really important for them to prioritise this in their future budget, for example. The Ministry of Environment in Haiti has 0.65% of the budget. I don\u2019t think it is normal. As a priority sector they need to receive more in order to help Haiti have better cover in terms of trees, and that could help us with all these hurricane storms that will come in here.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;object data=&quot;http://abfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/swf/fullsize_player.swf&quot; id=&quot;boo_embed_1032480&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; height=&quot;129&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://abfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/swf/fullsize_player.swf&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;scale&quot; value=&quot;noscale&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;salign&quot; value=&quot;lt&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;bgColor&quot; value=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowScriptAccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;wmode&quot; value=&quot;window&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;FlashVars&quot; value=&quot;mp3=http%3A%2F%2Faudioboo.fm%2Fboos%2F1032480-hurricane-sandy-in-haiti-prospery-raymond-of-christian-aid-talks-to-the-guardian-s-paul-owen.mp3%3Fkeyed%3Dtrue%26source%3Dembed&amp;amp;mp3Title=Hurricane+Sandy+in+Haiti%3A+Prospery+Raymond+of+Christian+Aid+talks+to+the+Guardian%27s+Paul+Owen&amp;amp;mp3Time=02.11pm+30+Oct+2012&amp;amp;mp3LinkURL=http%3A%2F%2Faudioboo.fm%2Fboos%2F1032480-hurricane-sandy-in-haiti-prospery-raymond-of-christian-aid-talks-to-the-guardian-s-paul-owen&amp;amp;mp3Author=PaulTOwen&amp;amp;rootID=boo_embed_1032480&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: none; display: block; width: 400px; height: 145px;&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;allowtransparency&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; marginheight=&quot;0&quot; marginwidth=&quot;0&quot; vspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://audioboo.fm/boos/1032480-hurricane-sandy-in-haiti-prospery-raymond-of-christian-aid-talks-to-the-guardian-s-paul-owen/embed&quot; title=&quot;Audioboo player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-508fe1d2b5792d0b94e6eaac\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-30T14:18:58.992Z\">2.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A video posted to YouTube captures the collapse last night of the <strong>facade of a building</strong> on 8th Ave in NYC.

Plantain trees and plantations ripped down, gardens flooded, and so in a country that primarily supports itself agriculturally, this is an extreme hit to the country.</p> </blockquote> <p>There would now be an increase in food prices and \u201cfood insecurity\u201d, with families finding it more difficult to harvest or sell their crops, she said. This would make it more difficult for them to send their children to school or repair their homes. Flooding and damaged homes were an immediate problem, \u201cbut in the coming months we\u2019re going to be looking at a real severe food security situation\u201d.</p> <p>She was less optimistic than Lisa Laumann of Save the Children (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/30/sandy-superstorm-flooding-power-cuts#block-508fce92b5792d0b94e6eaa0%20\">see earlier</a>) that the government was well-prepared to deal with this disaster, coming as it does so soon after the 2010 earthquake and Isaac in 2011.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The government has been active from the very beginning. The national disaster management system has been mobilised early on, and this is a nationwide system. And the government has also been meeting with international organisations to coordinate the response, and has also allocated an additional $800,000 for initial response actions, so they have been very present and very active, but the reality is that they\u2019re stretched in terms of capacity and in terms of ability to respond \u2026</p> <p>The capacity for the government to respond even prior to these storms was starting to diminish. Funding is drying up for cholera response. So, big concern. There\u2019ll need to be a national joint effort with all key stakeholders to respond and to respond swiftly.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;object data=&quot;http://abfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/swf/fullsize_player.swf&quot; id=&quot;boo_embed_1032437&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; height=&quot;129&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://abfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/swf/fullsize_player.swf&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;scale&quot; value=&quot;noscale&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;salign&quot; value=&quot;lt&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;bgColor&quot; value=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowScriptAccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;wmode&quot; value=&quot;window&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;FlashVars&quot; value=&quot;mp3=http%3A%2F%2Faudioboo.fm%2Fboos%2F1032437-hurricane-sandy-in-haiti-kristie-van-de-wetering-of-tearfund-talks-to-paul-owen-of-the-guardian.mp3%3Fkeyed%3Dtrue%26source%3Dembed&amp;amp;mp3Title=Hurricane+Sandy+in+Haiti%3A+Kristie+van+de+Wetering+of+Tearfund+talks+to+Paul+Owen+of+the+Guardian&amp;amp;mp3Time=01.35pm+30+Oct+2012&amp;amp;mp3LinkURL=http%3A%2F%2Faudioboo.fm%2Fboos%2F1032437-hurricane-sandy-in-haiti-kristie-van-de-wetering-of-tearfund-talks-to-paul-owen-of-the-guardian&amp;amp;mp3Author=PaulTOwen&amp;amp;rootID=boo_embed_1032437&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: none; display: block; width: 400px; height: 145px;&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;allowtransparency&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; marginheight=&quot;0&quot; marginwidth=&quot;0&quot; vspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://audioboo.fm/boos/1032437-hurricane-sandy-in-haiti-kristie-van-de-wetering-of-tearfund-talks-to-paul-owen-of-the-guardian/embed&quot; title=&quot;Audioboo player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-4be088ea-7c66-4ebc-90d8-310c0259fef9\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/30/1351605351867/5892f225-892b-46fa-822f-1e35d257ffdf-460.jpeg\" alt=\"A resident of Leogane, Haiti makes her way to her home as the water level continues to rise on 26 October 2012.

It went through Cuba, and we were at quite a distance from it. So when it came through it was still quite strong, although it was just a tropical storm. [It was] followed by days of intensive, intensive rain, that Thursday and Friday of last week were just \u2026 I\u2019ve hardly seen so much rain in a long time.</p> <p>It really led to a lot of damage in the country. There\u2019s been a substantial amount of damage to roads, a substantial amount of flooding in agricultural areas raising serious concerns about crops, and then of course with the standing water and the flow of water the increased concern about diaorrhea and disease, particularly cholera.</p> </blockquote> <p>Laumann was reasonably optimistic about the government's ability to deal with these issues.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What we saw during tropical storm Isaac and I think in tropical storm Sandy as well is a government that is challenged by the recurrent disasters that hit the country but also a government that is increasingly able to deal with this type of disaster. By that I mean that the government has a national system for the management of risks and disaster, and in the last two crises that have hit the country it has taken the lead.</p> </blockquote> <p>Organisations such as her own had \u201cplayed a role in preparation and response\u201d, but increasingly they were working under government leadership. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound like I think the government has infinite capacity to respond \u2026 but I think it\u2019s important to recognise that the government does have increasing ability to coordinate and manage disaster preparedness and response here.\u201d</p> <p>Why did so many people die, despite the eye of the storm not hitting Haiti directly?</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>People die because they are in the wrong place at the wrong time or because the infrastructure is not such that it protects them from incidents that occur. I think if the road infrastructure was stronger in this country, if there were better flood control, fewer people would die in emergencies like these.</p> </blockquote> <p>Laumann was speaking from a high-up area of Port-au-Prince, where there was no standing water, and children were out and off to school. \u201cThere certainly has been damage to some buildings, but it looks from here like a fairly normal day.\u201d</p> <p>But in the camps for those made homeless by the storm \u201cit\u2019s different\u201d:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>People lost their few assets that they had. They were flooded out \u2026 Life is much more challenging for them. It\u2019s hard when you lose most of your possessions or have them destroyed by a storm.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the south of the country there was a lot of road damage, she said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The last damage map that I took a look at showed damage in pretty much every department of the southern part of the country, much worse than the north. When you think about the fact that Haiti is already a road-challenged country, that\u2019s going to make problems for people who need to move around and for people who need to respond. Bridges have been broken, sections of road have been washed out, there\u2019s some land sliding over some of the roads.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-b049e51c-f6ba-45c2-bc8b-89eac47f229b\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/30/1351602063625/42cd89c9-da9f-4fd0-a7d3-6298969cdbe3-460.jpeg\" alt=\"The interior of a home is flooded after the passing of Hurricane Sandy in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on Saturday 27 October 2012.

Sandy has taken on the structure of a wintertime low-pressure area, so is no longer a tropical cyclone.</p> <p>The NHC says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The primary difference between a tropical cyclone and a wintertime cyclone is the energy source. Tropical cyclones extract heat from the ocean and grow by releasing that heat in the atmosphere near the storm center. Wintertime cyclones (also called extratropical or frontal <br>lows), on the other hand, get most of their energy from temperature contrasts in the atmosphere, and this energy usually gets distributed over larger areas.&#xa0;</p> <p>Because of these differences, tropical cyclones tend to have more compact wind fields, tend to be more symmetric, and have a well-defined inner core of strong winds. Wintertime lows have strong temperature contrasts or fronts attached to them, have a broader wind field, and more complex distributions of rain or snow.&#xa0;</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-508f94a795cb55519dae8b43\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-30T08:49:43.874Z\">8.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Fire in Queens, New York</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A fire department spokesman has told AP more than 190 firefighters are battling <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/30/sandy-superstorm-flooding-power-cuts?commentpage=all#block-508f8bc5b5792d0b94e6ea81\">the blaze in Breezy Point</a>.

  "<p>After watching media mass hysteria over hurricane Sandy on CNN for a chunk of the evening I went to bed on Monday night uncertain whether New York would still be with us by breakfast time. Yo, Big Apple, glad to wake up and find <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-news-blog/2012/oct/29/hurricane-sandy-new-york-live-blog\" title=\"\">you very wet but still more or less in one piece</a>.</p> <p>I'm not sure about CNN's reputation being intact in our house though. I don't often watch the channel much these days, but even with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiane_Amanpour\" title=\"\">Christiane Amanpour</a> \u2013 she's a veteran war correspondent and grownup \u2013 in charge of coverage of \"the monster storm from hell\", the output was completely over the top. It's the sort of occasion when the only experts being consulted sounded like the OTT variety. And, no, little or no climatic context was provided.</p> <p>By comparison, BBC1's Six O'Clock News, which only devoted its first five minutes or so to something that hadn't actually happened to the US eastern seaboard yet \u2013 and didn't live up to its billing when it did, peaking a few hours later \u2013 was a model of reticence. As ever Radio 4 is both calmer and more informative. All those misleading pictures often get in the way.</p> <p>I won't be back on CNN in a hurry, which is worrying \u2013 and not just for CNN either because intense competition between rival media in search of readers and viewers leads to hype and hysteria which must put off many customers. Even those in search of lurid sensation go off in search of even dafter novelty when they tire of waiting to see if CNN's intrepid reporter in storm-torn Atlantic City \u2013 his name was Ali \u2013 would be picked up by the wind and blown into the sea (or the \"literal Niagara Falls\" as one eyewitness called the ocean).</p> <p>In fairness I should concede that this has been a very big storm and a pretty serious event: 13 deaths, flooding in lower Manhattan, loss of power, evacuation of hospitals and low-lying areas (200,000 New Yorkers live less than four feet above sea level), the closure (every cloud has a silver lining?) of Wall Street.</p> <p>Some 60 million people have been affected in the US alone, solemnly warned by CNN that if they lost their electricity supply, food and medicine in the fridge might perish! I tell you, it's hell out there in the freezer section.</p> <p>It's also right that the authorities should persuade those seriously at risk to take that risk seriously, not least because officialdom knows it will be blamed anyway. Be sensible, stay indoors. People who normally lead safe lives are often not good at risk assessment \u2013 they worry about the wrong thing.</p> <p>As Jonathan Watts reports on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-news-blog/2012/oct/29/hurricane-sandy-new-york-live-blog\" title=\"\">the Guardian's storm live blog</a>, 69 people died when Sandy devastated the Caribbean, and Haiti was badly hit as usual. Alas, there are few global media corporations or foreign correspondents in Port-au-Prince, less medicine in the fridge too, so it made less of an impact. But Sandy has already been around for 10 days.</p> <p>We all understand how these things work. Extreme weather makes for great TV pictures. There's even a dedicated weather channel out there somewhere, where you can watch hurricanes or snow storms all day if you like. The same pictures of storm-lashed harbours (or if it were riots then burning buildings) come round time after time. Only the dramatic pics are shown. One ends up unsure how serious a crisis has really been.</p> <p>Not everyone sounded as if the end of the world was at hand. Bloomberg News seemed calmer. Mayor Mike Bloomberg (they are related) of New York was a model of calm, as Rudolph Giuliani was in New York's <em>real</em> trauma, the 9/11 attacks \u2013 a benchmark event that should have helped provide the city with perspective.</p> <p>Mitt Romney and Barack Obama both cancelled campaign events. The president returned to the White House and said all the right things. But he looked tired and sounded disengaged. Obama doesn't do empathy well. He was almost as hopeless as his Republican challenger safely above high tide in the mid-west.</p> <p>Since Romney wants to abolish the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Emergency_Management_Agency\" title=\"\">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> and leave things to individual states, there may be some advantage for Obama here. He still believes federal government can make a difference. One word \u2013 Katrina \u2013 the hurricane that devastated New Orleans in 2005 when warnings were ignored at local, state and federal level, suggests they need better government to take strategic precautions.</p> <p>Talking of which, the one phrase I didn't once hear on CNN last night \u2013 or on the BBC \u2013 was \"climate change\". In other words, context, the big picture. Climate, not mere weather. Was the scale of hurricane Sandy the product of a warming planet? Some experts say it's a contributory factor.</p> <p>I don't know the answer. That's way beyond my pay scale. What the telly boffins were saying was that its 1,000-mile size was the result of three specific weather events colliding: a traditional Caribbean hurricane, cold air coming down from the north and a high pressure system whose contribution the A-level geographer in me didn't quite understand.</p> <p>Consulting Google College (\"we never close\") this morning, I quickly found <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/10/29/yes-hurricane-sandy-is-a-good-reason-to-worry-about-climate-change/\" title=\"\">this sensibly tentative analysis</a>, which highlights warmer seas and melting icecaps. Both point to more flooding of port cities located by the sea, as port cities tend to be.</p> <p>There was one passing reference to a thinner icecap at the north pole which I caught on CNN last night. Perhaps the channel carried more when the excitement of the moment had passed. I hope so, not least because New York \u2013 the second most exposed US port after New Orleans \u2013 has apparently been talking about anti-surge barriers for years, but not acted.</p> <p>London of course has had its <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Barrier\" title=\"\">Thames Barrier</a>, second in size only to the Dutch big boy, since 1984. It was closed four times in the 1980s, 35 times in the 90s, and 75 times in the first decade of our century. Those wimpy Europeans do get some things right.</p> <p>So Americans should ponder, though I'm not sure if enough of them will do. I heard a US expert this morning \u2013 on the radio of course \u2013 saying that the eastern seaboard had experienced a series of extreme weather events these past 15 months. Hurricane Irene last year, a savage October snowfall \u2013 \"these are things we have not seen before in recorded history\".</p> <p>Quite so. Now I must try to find out what happened to CNN's on-the-spot reporter in Atlantic City. When I last saw Ali he was no longer staggering around a windswept street as if he expected to be whisked into the air. I've reported a US hurricane from a deserted Corpus Christi in Texas. My hurricane was also a media anticlimax \u2013 but they're scary.</p> <p>The city looked calmer and Ali's authority was undermined by three kids dancing in the street behind him. It all looked a bit showbiz, and safely at home behind the Thames Barrier we unkindly wondered whether CNN's commercial sponsors would have asked for their money back if Ali had been swept away during an ad break.</p>",
  "<p>Further to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/2012/oct/28/iowa-newspaper-romney-endorsement-election\">Ewen MacAskill's piece about the Des Moines Register endorsing Mitt Romney</a>, it is clear that the Republican contender is winning the newspaper endorsement race where it counts.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/193223/romney-obama-remain-tied-in-swing-state-newspaper-endorsements/\">A list drawn up by Poynter</a> shows that Romney is leading Obama with newspaper backing in the key swing states (11 to 8), though Obama is ahead overall (34-28).</p> <p>For example, in Florida, five papers have come out for Romney and just two for Obama. But the total circulation of the two Obama-supporting titles is only just short of the total for the five Romney backers. </p> <p>At least seven papers that supported Obama for president in 2008 have flipped to endorse Romney for president this time around. Aside from the Des Moines Register, the others are the Orlando Sentinel, Houston Chronicle, the Florida Times-Union, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, the South Florida Sun Sentinel and The Tennessean</p> <p>Looking at the wider picture, the circulation of Obama's 34 newspaper supporters is far greater than that for the 28 Romney papers - 9m compared to 5m.</p> <p>But, as with Britain, it is very uncertain whether such endorsements make any difference to the election outcome. That doesn't stop the candidates boasting about each endorsement, of course. Any sign of support is welcome.</p> <p><em>Sources:</em> <a href=\"http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/193223/romney-obama-remain-tied-in-swing-state-newspaper-endorsements/\">Poynter</a>/<a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/data/2012_newspaper_endorsements.php\">American Presidency Project</a></p>",

He filmed big operations by the FSA during the last battles. He was heading back to Lebanon through Azaz, when was taken by Dadikhi's guys. Most of the journalists who want to leave Aleppo take the route from Azaz, and the nearby Salama border checkpoint.</p> <p>But the checkpoint is under the control of Dadikhi and his gang.

Our workflow internally now involves digitising new developments into OpenStreetMap, including the roads, building outlines, land parcels and house numbers, as we're doing the street naming work. Using a MapProxy based web service provided by Astun Technology (which caches OSMGB tiles provided by the project at Nottingham) we've been able to plug all this new mapping data back into our intranet mapping system for users consumption along with all our other usual internal vector data.

Those cards might contain local restaurants, the traffic on your commute home, or when your flight is about to take off. They appear automatically as Google tries to guess the information you'll need at any given moment.</p> <p> While it seems like a relatively simple service, it's only really possible because of the massive amount of computational power Google can leverage alongside the massive amount of data Google knows about you thanks to your searches.</p> </blockquote> <p> Which is the tradeoff.

No, it succeeded because it was a better, more usable phone than almost anything else on the market. It just worked.

One point worth noting is on electoral fraud - made out by some to be a big problem. Trouble is the data don't agree: </p> <blockquote> <p>Of course, where there are 86 convictions (14 per year), there may be many more uncaught crimes. For the sake of argument, let's say that for each conviction there are 100 cases of fraud that go undetected. If that were the case, fraud would amount to about 0.003% of the vote, which would not be enough to affect even the close 2000 presidential election. Fox News looked into the problem and concluded \"One doesn't have to look far to find instances of fraudulent ballots cast in actual elections.\" But readers of that article have commented that Fox did have to look pretty far: all the way back to 1984, when a study found \"thousands\" of fraudulent votes between 1968 and 1982 in state races. Again, this comes out to somewhere in the range of 0.001% of votes. While every fraudulent vote is a felony that should be taken seriously, there is no way this level of activity could affect a national race.</p> </blockquote> <h2><a href=\"http://trollemipsum.appspot.com/\">Having trouble finding the right words? &gt;&gt; Trollem Ipsum</a></h2> <p>Haha. </p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.asymco.com/2012/10/22/nokias-price-for-exclusivity/\">Nokia's price for exclusivity &gt;&gt; asymco</a></h2> <p>Remember the $1bn Nokia has received from Microsoft for Windows Phone, after killing Symbian? </p> <blockquote> <p>The foregone revenues from Symbian (assuming they had been able to maintain the decline to the level of 150m units that they had originally forecast) would be about $9bn. This means that had Nokia not knifed Symbian and had sold the shortfall units at an average price of $200 they would have received an additional $9bn in sales. Furthermore, assuming a margin of 33% for those units, Nokia received from Microsoft one third from of what she gave up for exclusivity.</p> <p> In other words, the net cost of the Microsoft exclusive relationship is at least $2bn in operating profit.</p> <p> This turns out to be the difference between being profitable and being distressed.</p> </blockquote> <p> Utterly stunning.

  "<p>The full force of hurricane Sandy bore down on the most densely populated corridor of America on Monday putting the presidential election on pause, battering a string of coastal towns and suspending daily life for 60 million people between North Carolina and New England.</p> <p>Sandy, an unprecedented cross between a category one hurricane and wintry northeaster, unveiled its destructive potential early in what forecasters warned would be a long and dangerous storm.</p> <p>By 6pm it had sunk a tall ship 90 miles off the coast of North Carolina, killing at least one crew member, the first confirmed US fatality from the storm, and swamped a string of coastal resorts including the gambling mecca of Atlantic City.</p> <p>High winds felled a construction crane perched on top of an 80-storey building in midtown Manhattan, and knocked out power to more than 1.5m homes across several states. The frontage of a four-storey building on Eighth Avenue also crumbled but no casualties were reported.</p> <p>That was just the beginning. As Sandy made its westward turn towards the coast, the storm continued to gather strength, sustained winds reaching 90mph with gusts of up to 115mph. The centre of the storm was moving at up to 30mph, significantly faster than at the start of the day, heading for two cold-weather systems to form a hellish super-storm.</p> <p>Forecasters said the combined \"Frankenstorm\", as it has been nicknamed, could bring a foot of rain in some places, as well as potentially lethal storm surges, especially in lower Manhattan. High winds may produce power outages that last for days, while residents of West Virginia, North Carolina and Kentucky were told to expect up to 2ft of snow.</p> <p>The storm has killed at least 69 people on its path through the Caribbean, including 51 in Haiti. As Sandy began to lurch westwards towards the east coast, Barack Obama and authorities in nine states appealed to people to stay calm and out of harm's way. \"This is a serious and big storm and my first message is: 'You need to take this very seriously,'\" Obama told a briefing at the White House on Monday.</p> <p>He reinforced instructions to residents from local authorities. \"Please listen to what your state and local officials are saying. When they tell you to evacuate, you need to evacuate,\" the president said. \"Do not delay, don't pause, don't question the instructions that are being given, because this is a serious storm and could potentially have fatal consequences if people haven't acted.\"</p> <p>The storm forced Obama and his challenger, Mitt Romney, to suspend their campaigns, at least through Tuesday.</p> <p>Nine states declared a state of emergency, shutting down transport systems and schools and ordering residents of low-lying areas to head for higher ground. More than 12,000 flights were cancelled across the region, and the main rail service suspended.</p> <p>In lower Manhattan, which was expected to get the worst of the storm, New York City's mayor, Michael Bloomberg, warned that authorities were braced for an 11ft surge of seawater that could leave low-lying areas of the city under water. The city advised some 370,000 people in low-lying areas to evacuate at the weekend.</p> <p>By late morning, the authorities were moving to shut down the tunnels that connect Manhattan to Brooklyn and New Jersey. Subways, buses, trains and schools were shut, as was the New York stock exchange, and Bloomberg warned normal services should not be expected before Wednesday.</p> <p>In the meantime, Sandy continued to churn up the coast. In North Carolina, the crew was forced to abandon the tall ship HMS Bounty after it began to take on water. The coast guard plucked 14 crew members from lifeboats. Late last night, the body of one crew member, named as Claudene Christian, 42, was discovered by a helicopter crew. The captain, Robin Walbridge, 63, was missing.</p> <p>The storm also hammered coastal resort towns. \"In some places we have 2.5ft to 3ft of water on the ground and this is low tide,\" the Atlantic City mayor, Lorenzo Langford, told CNN. \"When Mother Nature sends her wrath your way we're at her mercy.\"</p> <p>There were reports of power outages from Virginia to Massachusetts.</p> <p>Away from the water in Manhattan, police cars drove slowly along streets broadcasting warnings: \"You must evacuate this area by 7pm today. Any person who knowingly violates this order may be charged with a class B misdemeanour.\"</p> <p>But Mark Gluck, a professor at Rutgers University, said Sandy was not about keep him from his daily cycle route. \"A bit of drizzle, a bit of wind, it's a perfectly fine day to go cycling,\" Gluck said.</p> <p>He had already stocked up his apartment to ride out the storm. \"I'm well prepared, I've got food and water, I think it'll be fine.\"</p> <p>Most, though, appeared to heed the warnings to hunker down at home or get out of town. But that created its own sense of dread. In Washington DC and other cities, many supermarkets ran out of staples such as bottled water and batteries well before the storm bore down.</p> <p>New York City's mandatory evacuation saw people crowding into evacuation centres across the five boroughs. Around 80 stayed overnight at the John Jay high school in Park Slope, Brooklyn, with many more expected last night.</p> <p>After last year's hurricane Irene, staff and volunteers were ready for them. A handwritten sign inside the door divided newcomers into two categories: people to the right, animals to the left.</p> <p>\"This time last year we had 1,000 people in here,\" said one of three officials as he stood outside on a break. \"We had two rooms full of dogs and cats too. This year we've even got a turtle. And that snake's got his eye on the mouse. It's not gonna happen.\"</p> <p>Inside, people from Coney Island, Red Hook and other low-lying areas of Brooklyn gathered to wait out the storm. They were served a cooked breakfast and there was BBQ chicken for lunch.</p> <p>Staff were surprised there were not more of them and wondered whether last year, when Irene passed New York without major incident, had given people false sense of security. \"They ran out last year thinking it was the end, and it wasn't. But this one's different.\"</p> <p>\"It's horrible,\" said Davon Little, who manages a supermarket in the Brookland neighbourhood of north-east Washington after he ran out of water for a second time. \"The line's been going all the way down the aisles. It's crowded and there are no carts outside. I've had two arguments over beer.\"</p>"
