  "<p>Some senior Taliban figures are ready to negotiate a ceasefire and might be ready to accept a long-term US military presence in Afghanistan as part of a comprehensive peace deal, according to a report to be published on Monday based on interviews with Taliban officials and negotiators.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.rusi.org/talibanbriefing2012\" title=\"\">The report</a>, published by the Royal United Services Institute, finds that the Taliban is determined to make a decisive break with al-Qaida as part of a settlement and is open to negotiation about education for girls, but is adamantly opposed to the constitution which it sees as a prop for President Hamid Karzai's government.</p> <p>The Taliban insurgents will not negotiate with the Karzai government largely because of its record of corruption. They do not trust Kabul to run fair elections, which suggests that, even if the moderates interviewed in the study prevailed within Taliban circles, serious obstacles to a peace deal would remain.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.rusi.org/talibanbriefing2012\" title=\"\">The institute's report</a>, entitled Taliban Perspectives on Reconciliation, is the product of interviews with four unnamed figures, two of whom were ministers in the former Taliban government and are still close to the inner circle of leadership. One is described as being \"closely associated\" with Mullah Mohammad Omar, the Taliban leader. A third is portrayed as \"a senior former mujahideen commander and lead negotiator for the Taliban\", although not part of the movement itself, and the fourth is said to be \"an Afghan mediator with extensive experience negotiating with the Taliban\".</p> <p>The report concludes: \"The Taliban would be open to negotiating a ceasefire as part of a general settlement, and also as a bridge between confidence-building measures and the core issue of the distribution of political power in Afghanistan.</p> <p>\"A ceasefire would require strong Islamic justification, obscuring any hint of surrender,\" it adds.</p> <p>Even more surprising, in view of the official Taliban propaganda portraying it as leading a struggle against foreign invaders, the report says the insurgents are \"prepared to accept a long-term US military presence in Afghanistan\".</p> <p>According to one interviewee, described as a founder member of the Taliban, a settlement that left US troops operating out of five primary military bases \u2013 Kandahar, Herat, Jalalabad, Mazar-e-Sharif and Kabul \u2013 might be acceptable as long as the US presence \"does not impinge on our independence and religion\". In other words, the Taliban might accept continuing US counter-terrorist operations targeting their former ally, al-Qaida, as long as the bases were not used as a launching pad for attacks on other countries or for interference in Afghan politics.</p> <p>The report even suggests that the Taliban would co-operate in tracking down al-Qaida members, noting that the leadership and base \"deeply regret\" their past association with the global jihadist group.</p> <p>Michael Semple, one of the report's co-authors and a former EU envoy to Afghanistan, said that interviewees represented a significant but not yet dominant strand in Taliban views. \"We are not saying that this is some kind of poll that says three out of four Taliban members are in favour of a ceasefire,\" he said. \"But there is a part of the movement who see there is no prospect of a military victory and so ceasefire would make sense. This is not the official line, but rather the outer fringe of Taliban thought. It's not mainstream yet.\"</p> <p>Semple, now at Harvard University, <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/politics/2012/07/taliban-commander-i-was-relieved-death-osama?quicktabs_most_read=0\" title=\"\">interviewed another Taliban commander in July</a>, who also admitted there was no prospect of an insurgent victory, but he said that commander was not part of the institute's study.</p> <p>Contacts between US officials and Taliban representatives have stalled largely because of failure to conclude a confidence-building deal to exchange five Taliban prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay for a US soldier captured by insurgents. Substantive talks, which were due to be held in Qatar, are expected to remain on hold until after the US presidential election in November, but senior US officials said they were holding discussions this week with Pakistan, where the Taliban leadership is based, about the safe passage of insurgent officials for future peace talks.</p> <p>\"Reconciliation remains a key component of our strategy,\" a senior US official said. \"The safe passage working group was meeting this week alone as a piece of that, and Ambassador [Marc] Grossman [the US special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan] will embark on an upcoming trip at some point to continue to pursue this in a very robust manner.\u2026\"</p> <p>Another senior official stressed that the official US designation on Friday of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/07/haqqani-network-terrorist-hillary-clinton\" title=\"\">the Haqqani network</a>, a Taliban faction based in the Pakistani tribal area of Waziristan, would not rule out future talks with the group, and would not lead to the financial sanctions against Pakistan. The official disowned <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/politics/2012/07/taliban-commander-i-was-relieved-death-osama?quicktabs_most_read=0\" title=\"\">allegations made last year</a> by Admiral Mike Mullen, the outgoing chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, who described the Haqqani network as \"a veritable arm\" of Pakistani intelligence.</p> <p>\"I want to just unequivocally state that this in no way is the consensus, unanimous view of this administration; that we are making absolutely no effort to begin a process to designate Pakistan as a state sponsor of terrorism,\" the US official said.</p> <p>Semple said he did not think the designation of the Haqqanis would have any serious impact on future peace talks.</p> <p>\"The US have already given them a good few chances to to do politics,\" he said. \"They are really at the heart of the nastiest part of the armed struggle.\"</p>",
  "<p>As the Westminster tempo cranks up, just as the marvel of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/09/observer-editorial-olympics-paralympics-inspiring?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Olympic and Paralympic summer</a> winds down, the main party leaders will be looking for ways of securing immediate momentum. Following his bumpy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/sep/04/cameron-reshuffle-government-politics-live?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">reshuffle</a> David Cameron needs to demonstrate to an increasingly sceptical public that he hasn't become the prisoner of a divided party and a fractious coalition. Meanwhile, Ed Miliband has to show that he has what it takes to make a popular pitch that resonates with the public on how to secure shared prosperity in straightened times, as President Obama did at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/07/best-of-democratic-national-convention\" title=\"\">Democratic convention</a> last week.</p> <p>Yet both leaders know that as well as successfully negotiating the party conference season they also need to cast ahead in order to get a fix on the shape of the 2015 election. It certainly isn't going to be the campaign either would have liked. Indeed, it won't even be the election they didn't really want but thought they'd have to make the best of. 2015 has the look of a nightmare for all sides involved.</p> <p>Occasionally the imperatives facing the nation at election time and the underlying aspirations of the victorious party leader are in harmony. Blair in 1997, Thatcher in 1979 and Macmillan in 1959 can each lay claim to having been leaders successfully channelling the prevailing public mood while keeping within touching distance of their own instinctive political projects (though all such judgments are coloured by the corrective tint of hindsight).</p> <p>The victor in 2015 may not be so fortunate. David Cameron \u2013 whose natural comfort zone still remains talking breezily about the good times and giveaways around the corner \u2013 didn't come into politics to preside over an enervating decade of economic pessimism any more than Ed Miliband did to shrink the state. Yet that is where they are headed.</p> <p>Above all, this is because of our still deteriorating fiscal position. Last autumn, before the double-dip recession and the full-blown euro crisis, the <a href=\"http://budgetresponsibility.independent.gov.uk/economic-and-fiscal-outlook-november-2011/\" title=\"\">Office for Budget Responsibility</a> downgraded its growth projections, pushing back the date at which the structural deficit will be eliminated to 2017. Their forecasts now look implausibly rosy compared with those of others. Even before recent gloomy public finance figures and the growing realisation that the chancellor's \"debt rule\" is very likely to be broken, no one would have been surprised if George Osborne was forced to announce a further lengthening of the era of austerity, with <a href=\"https://mm.jpmorgan.com/stp/t/c.do?i=24286-2&amp;u=a_p*d...\" title=\"\">cuts spilling out across the decade</a>.</p> <p>This presents something of a challenge for all the party leaders. The initial Conservative strategy of going into 2015 having \"cleared up Labour's mess\", and offering major tax cuts for families, feels like a distant dream. What they are still coming to terms with, however, is the realisation that the revised plan for a 2015 parliament of two halves \u2013 \"finishing the job\" of austerity during the first few years before sunlight creeps through thereafter \u2013 appears increasingly optimistic. George Osborne may well end up in the unhappy position of trying to convince the public, in a haunting echo of the 2010 campaign, that he is still the man to bring the nation's finances back into balance by the end of the next parliament.</p> <p>You might think that this would make the opposition's strategy straightforward. It certainly provides them with plenty to aim at. But it could destabilise Labour too. Their initial hope of turning the election into referendum on who has the best plan for \"jobs and growth\" will doubtless still feature but it may struggle to get a hearing with the public unless Labour also have convincing answers to the fiscal questions that dominate all elections \u2013 the next one more than ever.</p> <p>A likely fallback position, invoking the 1997 playbook by sticking to the Conservative's spending totals for several years with the expectation of increases later in the parliament, is also looking hopeful. And if the structural deficit is set to be with us for most of the decade it is likely to erode any wriggle-room that some on the centre-left hope exists to \"do a Hollande\", adopting a slightly slower path of fiscal consolidation than their Tory rivals.</p> <p>Nor will Nick Clegg be spared. Having already boxed himself in by committing to undertake a coalition spending review that locks his party into shared spending plans until 2017, a promise that looks increasingly implausible, any further extension of the austerity era would only deepen his misery. Every time Osborne's fiscal plans are downgraded, so is confidence in Clegg's political judgment.</p> <p>The two main parties can mount a case about why they are best placed to respond. The Conservatives rest heavily on their conviction that if the exam question set for the next election is \"how to secure a parliament of cuts\" then Labour will never be the answer. Labour's riposte will be that the more difficult the economic news the stronger the yearning will be for a \"change election\" on the economy and the greater the premium on fairness in austerity \u2013 fertile terrain for Miliband, stony ground for the incumbent Cameron.</p> <p>A test of political leadership is adapting to new times and reinventing yourself as the person most able to manage them. Prospective prime ministers often don't get to fight the election they want. Whoever wins in 2015 will be running against themselves, as well as the fiscal headwinds.</p>",
  "<p>A \"wicked smart\" female CIA agent who had been tracking Osama bin Laden for five years was central to the US's assassination of the terrorist leader, according to one of the Navy Seals who took part in the attack.</p> <p>\"Mark Owen\" the pseudonymous author of No Easy Day, a controversial first-person account of the killing, said the agent, whom he referred to as \"Jen\", was convinced Bin Laden was hiding at the compound in Abbotabad, Pakistan, where he was found.</p> <p>She travelled with the Seals to Afghanistan ahead of the raid and briefed them on what they were likely to find. \"I can't give her enough credit. In my opinion she kind of teed up this whole thing,\" Owen told CBS's 60 Minutes in an interview to be broadcast Sunday.</p> <p>Owen described Jen as \"wicked smart, kind of feisty\". She was 100% sure that bin Laden was hiding in the Abbotabad compound, according to Owen. President Barack Obama, defence secretary Leon Panetta and others have said they were only 70% sure Bin Laden would be found at the compound. Owen told 60 Minutes that all of her predictions proved to be exactly right.</p> <p>In the interview Owen denied suggestions that the timing of his book had anything to do with November's election. Obama and other Democrats made numerous mentions of the assassination at last week's convention. But Owen said the book had always been planned for release around the anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks and had nothing to do with the election.</p> <p>The Pentagon and the White House have declined to comment on the new account but have said they are weighing disciplinary or legal action against the author.</p> <p>The account contradicts some elements of the official telling of Bin Laden's death. The US government accounts say Bin Laden was killed after he ducked back into his bedroom, raising fears he was reaching for a weapon.</p> <p>According to Owen, Bin Laden was shot when he looked out of his bedroom door. When Seals entered his room he was on the floor, clearly badly injured. They then shot him again.</p> <p>Owen says he was charged with taking the photographs to prove the Al Qaeda leader was dead. \"I figured these were probably some of the most important photos I would take in my life, so make sure I do it right, get good angles and all this other stuff,\" he said. He said he had to clean Bin Laden's face, using a sheet off a bed, to make sure he was clearly recognizable. He said the photographs were \"pretty gruesome\".</p> <p>During the programme, the Navy Seal's voice and face were disguised mask his identity.</p>",
  "<p>As Republicans were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/29/republicans-hurricane-mitt-romney-ann\" title=\"\">promoting themselves as a multiracial party</a> from the platform in Tampa two weeks ago,&#xa0;an ugly incident on the convention floor suggested not everyone had got the memo. From the podium a range of speakers of Haitian, Mexican, Cuban and Indian descent spoke of how their parents had overcome huge barriers so they could succeed in the US. In the audience, a successful black woman who works for CNN was being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/29/republican-national-convention-race-tampa\" title=\"\">pelted with peanuts</a> by a convention-goer, who said: \"This is how we feed the animals.\"</p> <p>The tension between the <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/169746/behind-gops-diversity-display\" title=\"\">projection of a modern, inclusive, tolerant party</a> and the reality of a sizeable racially intolerant element within its base pining for the restoration of white privilege is neither new nor accidental. Indeed, it in no small part explains the trajectory of the Republican party for almost the last&#xa0;half century. In his diary, Richard Nixon's chief-of-staff, Bob Haldeman, described how his boss spelled out the racial contours of a new electoral game-plan to win southern and suburban whites over to the Republican party in the wake of the civil rights era. \"You have to face the fact that the whole problem is really the blacks,\" Nixon told him. \"The key is to devise a system that recognises that while not appearing to.\"</p> <p>This could be the final hurrah for what became known as Nixon's southern strategy in what is shaping up to be the most racially polarised election ever. Black support for the Republican party literally cannot get any lower. A recent <a href=\"http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/08/21/13399788-nbcwsj-poll-heading-into-conventions-obama-has-four-point-lead NBC/\" title=\"\">Wall Street Journal poll</a> had 0% of African-Americans saying they intend to vote for Romney. At 32%, <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/154559/US-Presidential-Election-Center.aspx\" title=\"\">support among Latinos is higher</a> but still remains pathetically low given what Republicans need to win (40%) and what they have had in the past \u2013 in 2004 George W Bush won 44%. As a result, the party of Lincoln is increasingly dependent on just one section of the electorate \u2013 white people. To win, Romney needs 61% of the white vote from a white turnout of 74%. That's a lot. In 2008, John McCain got 55% from the same turnout. \"<a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/thenextamerica/politics/obama-needs-80-of-minority-vote-to-win-2012-presidential-election-20120824\" title=\"\">This is&#xa0;the last time anyone will try to do this</a>,\" one Republican strategist told the&#xa0;National Journal. And Republican consultant Ana Navarro <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-republican-minority-party-20120829,0,3047039.story\" title=\"\">told the Los Angeles Times</a>: \"Where his numbers are right now, we should be pressing the panic button.\"</p> <p>There are two main reasons for this panic. The first is that the \"system\" Nixon referred to is now recognisable by most \u2013 particularly with a black president in the White House. As people have become more attuned to the frequency of the dog whistles, the tone has necessarily become more shrill. During the primaries, <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/165576/gops-blatant-racism\" title=\"\">Rick Santorum told a crowd in New Hampshire</a>: \"I don't want to make black people's lives better by giving them somebody else's money; I want to give them the opportunity to go out and earn the money.\" Newt Gingrich branded Obama \"<a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-01-25/gingrich-calling-obama-food-stamp-president-draws-critics.html\" title=\"\">the food stamp president</a>\". Just a few weeks ago, in a clear nod to the \"birthers\", who insist Obama was not born in the US, the party's nominee, <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/24/romney-makes-a-birther-joke-while-campaigning/\" title=\"\">Mitt Romney, went to Michigan and joked</a>: \"No one's ever asked to see my birth certificate. They know that this&#xa0;is the place that we were born and raised.\" This is rhetorical peanut throwing. When everyone can hear it, you've transitioned from a dog whistle to a straight-up whistle.</p> <p>Second, with <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/09/us/politics/obama-may-still-have-an-ally-in-wisconsin-demographics.html\" title=\"\">white people destined to become a minority</a> in a few decades, the strategy is no longer an anchor but a millstone. Tying Republican fortunes to the white vote made electoral sense in the early 1970s. Since 1980, the white share of the electorate has fallen in every consecutive election bar one \u2013 1996, when Ross Perot ran. The more black and Latino voters the Republicans alienate, the more white voters they need to replace them. The trouble is they are fishing for a larger number in a smaller pool, which demands ever more juicy bait. \"The demographics race we're losing badly,\" said Senator Lindsey Graham, acknowledging the problem. \"We're not generating enough angry white guys to stay in business for the long term.\"</p> <p>But that's not for want of trying. In just one example, the New York Times' <a href=\"http://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/27/making-the-election-about-race/\" title=\"\">Thomas Edsall analyses</a> a Romney ad lambasting Obama's healthcare reform. The ad states: \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4gPvToKTWU\" title=\"\">You paid into Medicare for years</a> \u2013 every pay check. Now when you need it, Obama has cut $716bn from Medicare. Why? To pay for Obamacare. The money you paid for your guaranteed healthcare is going to a massive new government programme that is not for&#xa0;you.\"</p> <p>Leave aside the fact that the ad is <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/aug/20/mitt-romney/romney-says-obama-cuts-716-medicare-pay-obamacare/\" title=\"\">judged by Politifact as only half true</a> and that the Republican vice-presidential candidate <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/aug/15/news/la-pn-romney-paul-ryan-medicare-cuts-20120815\" title=\"\">Paul Ryan has proposed a budget</a> that would cut a similar amount from Medicare without healthcare reform. More than three-quarters of Medicare recipients are white; more than half those without health insurance are not white. By linking the two in this way, \"Obamacare\" thereby becomes a transfer of resources from hard working white retirees to indigent minority ethnic people. Meanwhile, Larry McCarthy, who produced the now infamously racist <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC9j6Wfdq3o\" title=\"\">Willie Horton ad</a> for George HW Bush's campaign in 1988, is working for one of the Super Pac's backing Romney.</p> <p>Describing the evolution of the Republicans' racial appeal, the late Lee Atwater, one-time chair of the Republican National Committee and member of the Reagan administration, <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E6DF1E30F935A35753C1A9639C8B63\" title=\"\">said in 1981</a>. \"You start out in 1954 by saying, 'Nigger, nigger, nigger'. By 1968 you can't say 'nigger' \u2013 that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing [and] states' rights. You're getting so abstract now [that] you're talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you're talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is [that] blacks get hurt worse than whites \u2026 obviously sitting around saying, 'We want to cut this' is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and&#xa0;a hell of a lot more abstract than 'nigger, nigger'.\"</p> <p>Reflecting on her experience in Tampa, Patricia Carroll, the CNN camerawoman who had peanuts thrown at her said: \"<a href=\"http://mije.org/richardprince/cnn-camerawoman-not-surprised-peanut-throwing#Carroll\" title=\"\">I can't change these people's hearts and minds</a> \u2026 This should be a&#xa0;wake-up call to black people \u2026 People were living in euphoria for a while.

  "<p><em>[Updated below - Update II (Mon.)]</em></p> <p>In October 2003, the intensely pro-US president of Bolivia, Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez de Lozada, sent his security forces to suppress growing popular protests <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/17/world/bolivia-s-poor-proclaim-abiding-distrust-of-globalization.html?\">against the government's energy and globalization policies</a>. Using high-powered rifles and machine guns, his military forces killed 67 men, women and children, and injured 400 more, almost all of whom were poor and from the nation's indigenous Aymara communities. Dozens of protesters had been <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/14/world/bolivian-president-remains-defiant-as-protests-intensify.html?\">killed by government forces</a> in the prior months when troops were sent to suppress them.</p> <p>The resulting outrage over what became known as \"the Gas Wars\" <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/18/world/bolivian-leader-resigns-and-his-vice-president-steps-in.html?\">drove Sanchez de Lozada from office</a> and then into exile in the United States, where he was welcomed by his close allies in the Bush administration. He has lived under a shield of asylum in the US ever since.</p> <p>The Bolivians, however, have never stopped attempting to bring their former leader to justice for what they insist are his genocide and crimes against humanity: namely, ordering the killing of indigenous peaceful protesters in cold blood (as <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1586707,00.html\">Time Magazine put it</a>: \"according to witnesses, the military fired indiscriminately and without warning in El Alto neighborhoods\"). In 2007, Bolivian prosecutors <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7050273.stm\">formally charged him</a> with genocide for the October 2003 incident, charges which were <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1586707,00.html\">approved by the nation's supreme court</a>. </p> <p>Bolivia then <a href=\"http://jurist.org/paperchase/2008/11/bolivia-officials-request-extradition.php\">demanded his extradition</a> from the US for him to stand trial. That demand, ironically, was made pursuant to an extradition treaty signed by S\u00e1nchez de Lozada himself with the US. Civil lawsuits <a href=\"http://ccrjustice.org/ourcases/current-cases/mamani-v-sanchez\">have also been filed</a> against him in the US on behalf of the surviving victims.</p> <p>The view that S\u00e1nchez de Lozada must be extradited from the US to stand trial is a political consensus in Bolivia, shared by the government and the main opposition party alike. But on Friday night, the <a href=\"http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-09-07/news/sns-rt-us-bolivia-usabre88614o-20120907_1_president-evo-morales-extradition-coca-farmer\">Bolivian government revealed</a> that it had just been notified by the Obama administration that the US government has refused Bolivia's extradition request:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"'Yesterday (Thursday), a document arrived from the United States, rejecting the extradition of people who have done a lot of damage to Bolivia,' leftist [President Evo] Morales, an outspoken critic of US foreign policy in Latin America, said in a speech.</p> <p>\"Calling the United States a 'paradise of impunity' and a 'refuge for criminals,' Morales said Washington turned down the extradition request on the grounds that a civilian leader cannot be tried for crimes committed by the military \u2026</p> <p>\"Sanchez de Lozada's extradition was also demanded by opposition leaders in Bolivia and they criticized the US decision.</p> <p>\"Rogelio Mayta, a lawyer representing victims of the 2003 violence, said 'the US protection' of Sanchez de Lozada was not surprising.</p> <p>\"'It's yet another display of the US government's double moral standard,' he said.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Because he has yet to be tried, I have no opinion on whether S\u00e1nchez de Lozada is guilty of the crimes with which he has been formally charged (Bolivian courts <a href=\"http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/08/bolivia-high-court-convicts-7-officials-for-genocide.php\">have convicted</a> several other military officers on genocide charges in connection with these shootings). But the refusal of the Obama administration to allow him to stand trial for what are obviously very serious criminal allegations is completely consistent with American conceptions of justice and is worth examining for that reason.</p> <p>Let's begin with two vital facts about the former Bolivian leader.</p> <p>First, S\u00e1nchez de Lozada was exactly the type of America-revering-and-obeying leader the US has always wanted for other nations, especially smaller ones with important energy resources. When he was driven into exile in October 2003, the New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/23/world/bolivian-leader-s-ouster-seen-as-warning-on-us-drug-policy.html?\">described him</a> as \"Washington's most stalwart ally in South America\".</p> <p>The former leader \u2013 a multimillionaire mining executive who, having been educated in the US, spoke Spanish with a heavy American accent \u2013 was a loyal partner in America's drug war in the region. More importantly, the former leader himself was a vehement proponent and relentless crusader for free trade and free market policies favored by the US: policies that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/17/world/bolivia-s-poor-proclaim-abiding-distrust-of-globalization.html?ref=gonzalosanchezdelozada\">the nation's indigenous poor long believed</a> (with <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/20/world/bolivian-peasants-ideology-of-fury-still-smolders.html?\">substantial basis</a>) resulted in their impoverishment while enriching Bolivia's small Europeanized elite.</p> <p>It was S\u00e1nchez de Lozada's forced exile that ultimately led to the 2006 election and 2009 landslide re-election of Morales, a figure the New York Times in October 2003 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/23/world/bolivian-leader-s-ouster-seen-as-warning-on-us-drug-policy.html?\">described as</a> one \"regarded by Washington as its main enemy\". Morales has been as vehement an opponent of globalization and free trade as S\u00e1nchez de Lozada was a proponent, and has constantly opposed US interference in his region and elsewhere (in 2011, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20046315-503544.html\">Morales called</a> for the revocation of Obama's Nobel Peace Prize as a result of the intervention in Libya).</p> <p>So, this extradition refusal is, in one sense, a classic and common case of the US exploiting pretenses of law and justice to protect its own leaders and those of its key allies from the rule of law, even when faced with allegations of the most egregious wrongdoing. If the Obama DOJ <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/31/obama-justice-department-immunity-bush-cia-torturer\">so aggressively shielded</a> accused Bush war criminals from all forms of accountability, it is hardly surprising that it does the same for loyal US puppets. That a government that defies US dictates is thwarted and angered in the process is just an added bonus. That, too, is par for the course. </p> <p>But there's another important aspect of this case that distinguishes it from the standard immunity Washington gifts to itself and its friends. When he ran for president in 2002, S\u00e1nchez de Lozada was deeply unpopular among the vast majority of Bolivians as a result of his prior four-year term as president in the 1990s. To find a way to win despite this, he hired the consulting firm owned and operated by three of Washington's most well-connected Democratic party operatives: James Carville, Stan Greenberg and Bob Shrum. He asked them to import the tactics of American politics into Bolivia to ensure his election victory. </p> <p>As detailed by a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/26/movies/26fore.html?_r=1\">2006 New York Times review</a> of a film about the Democratic operatives' involvement in Bolivia's election, their strategy was two-fold: first, destroy the reputations of his two opponents so as to depress the enthusiasm of Bolivia's poor for either of them; and then mobilize S\u00e1nchez de Lozada's base of elites to ensure he wins by a tiny margin. That strategy worked, as he was elected with a paltry 22.5% of the popular vote. From the Times review:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"'[The film] asks a more probing question: whether Mr Carville and company, in selling a pro-globalization, pro-American candidate, can export American-style campaigning and values to a country so fundamentally different from the United States \u2026</p> <p>\"'It's a very explosive film in Bolivia because it shows close up a very deliberate strategy,' said Jim Shultz, an American political analyst in Bolivia who recently saw the film with a group of friends. 'The film is especially explosive because it's about a candidate \u2013 so identified with the United States and so hated by so many Bolivians \u2013 being put into office by the political manipulations of US consultants.'</p> <p>\"Mauro Quispe, 33, a cabdriver in La Paz, said he saw slices of the film on the television news, and it raised his ire. 'I was stunned,' he said. 'He was being advised by the Americans, and everything they said was in English.'\"</p> </blockquote> <p>There's no evidence, at least of which I'm aware, that any of these Democratic operatives intervened on behalf of their former client in his extradition pleas to the Obama administration, but it rather obviously did not hurt. At the very least, shielding a former leader deposed by his own people from standing trial for allegedly gunning down unarmed civilians takes on an even uglier image when that former leader had recently had leading US Democratic operatives on his payroll.</p> <p>Then, there are the very revealing parallels between this case and the recent decision by Ecuador to grant asylum to Julian Assange, until his fears of political persecution from being extradited to Sweden are resolved. Remember all those voices who were so deeply outraged at Ecuador's decision? Given that he faces criminal complaints in Sweden, they proclaimed, protecting Assange with asylum constitutes a violent assault on the rule of law.</p> <p>Do you think any of the people who attacked Ecuador on that ground will raise a peep of protest at what the US did here in shielding this former leader from facing charges of genocide and crimes against humanity back in his own country? In contrast to Ecuador \u2013 which is fervently seeking an agreement to allow Assange to go to Sweden to face those allegations while simultaneously protecting his political rights \u2013 the US has done nothing, and is doing nothing, to ensure that S\u00e1nchez de Lozada will ever have to face trial. To the contrary, until Thursday, the US has steadfastly refused even to acknowledge Bolivia's extradition request, even though the crimes for which they want to try him are plainly within the scope of the two nations' extradition treaty.</p> <p>Then there's the amazing fact that Democrats, who understandably scorn Mitt Romney for piling up massive personal wealth while he advocates policies harmful to the poor, continue in general to revere these types of Clintonites who, arguably to a lesser extent, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/apr/04/hillaryclinton.uselections2008\">have done the same</a>. Indeed, Democrats spent all last week wildly praising Bill Clinton, who has <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/03/politics/clinton-speaking-fees/index.html\">made close to $100m</a> in speaking fees alone by traveling the globe, <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/bill-clinton-brazil-no-1-among-rising-economies-170823632--business.html\">speaking to hedge funds</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2001/11.29/09-clinton.html\">advocating globalization and free trade</a>.</p> <p>In this case, one finds both the prevailing rules and the prevailing orthodoxies of American justice. High-level leaders in the US government and those who serve their interests are exempt from the rule of law (even when <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/28/us/28bosch.html?pagewanted=all\">accused of heinous acts of terrorism</a>); only leaders who run afoul of US dictates <a href=\"http://miami.cbslocal.com/2011/11/23/noriega-to-be-extradited-to-panama/\">should be held accountable</a>. </p> <p>Even in the civil case against him, an appellate court <a href=\"http://ccrjustice.org/ourcases/current-cases/mamani-v-sanchez\">ultimately ruled</a> that he was immune from damages or civil lawsuits, overturning a lower court ruling that there were sufficient allegations of genocide and war crimes against him to allow the suit to proceed. <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/05/04/more_federal_judge_abdication/\">As usual</a>, US federal courts are the leaders in ensuring that the most politically well-connected are shielded from the consequences of their acts.</p> <p>Relatedly, we find the prevailing sentiment that asylum is something that is only to be granted by the US and its western allies against unfriendly governments. The notion that one may need asylum <em>from</em> the US or the west \u2013 or that small Latin American countries unfavorable to the US can grant it rather than have it granted against them \u2013 is offensive and perverse to all good and decent western citizens, who know that political persecution is <a href=\"http://ggsidedocs.blogspot.com.br/2012/09/believing-oppression-only-happens.html\">something that happens only far away from them</a>.</p> <p>The protection of this accused former leader will likely generate little controversy in the US because it was the by-product of the actions of both the Bush and Obama administrations, and because it comports so fully with how American justice functions. The only surprising thing would have been if there had been a different outcome.</p> <p><strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong>: One astute commenter on Twitter, noting the Obama administration's <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/03/06/attorney_general_holder_defends_execution_without_charges/\">claimed right</a> to assassinate even its own citizens without due process or charges, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eTajikistan/status/244876659835146240\">asks</a>:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395907859\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/9/1347219137832/bolivia1.png\" alt=\"bolivia tweet\" width=\"487\" height=\"241\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>If the US felt compelled to adhere to the same set of rules it imposes on everyone else, then the obvious answer would be \"yes\". But the point demonstrated by this episode (and countless others) is that the US clearly feels no such compulsion.</p> <p><strong><em>UPDATE II [Mon.]</em></strong>: Several people have questioned why \"genocide\" is the appropriate charge for the crimes that occurred here. That is but one of the charges levied by Bolivian prosecutors and courts, and as the <a href=\"http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2011/09/15/the-bolivia-genocide-case-ex-regime-figures-convicted-us-shelters-top-fugitive-53633\">Bolivians seem to recognize</a>, that term has a different meaning under their domestic criminal law than it does under international law. International law professor Kevin Jon Heller <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kevinjonheller/status/244870849948168194\">yesterday suggested</a> that while \"genocide\" would not apply to these acts under international law, the term \"crimes against humanity\" -- for indiscriminately shooting unarmed protesters -- seems clearly appropriate.</p>",
  "<p>Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney said Sunday he will keep some of Barack Obama's controversial healthcare reforms if he wins November's election, breaking from a prior whole-scale rejection of the plan.</p> <p>\"Of course there are a number of things that I like in healthcare reform that I'm going to put in place,\" he said in an interview broadcast Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press.</p> <p>Republicans have pledged to repeal \"Obamacare\" \u2013 legislation that has become the focus of a furious backlash from Republicans. Paul Ryan, the party's vice-presidential pick, has described the affordable care act as a \"Ponzi scheme that would make Bernie Madoff proud\". Romney himself has described the legislation as a \"job killer\" that \"puts the federal government between you and your doctor\".</p> <p>But the former Massachusetts governor said Sunday there were a number of pieces of the legislation he would keep if elected, including making sure that people with pre-existing conditions can get insurance. Romney also said he would allow young adults to keep their coverage under their parents' health insurance.</p> <p>\"I say we're going to replace Obamacare. And I'm replacing it with my own plan,\" Romney said. \"And even in Massachusetts when I was governor, our plan there deals with pre-existing conditions and with young people.\"</p> <p>The interview came as it emerged that Obama had received a larger boost than Romney in the polls following their respective conventions. According to Scott Rasmussen's latest poll Obama now leads Romney 49% to 45%, his biggest lead since March 17 and his best approval rating of the year. Obama also has a four-point lead in the most recent Gallup and Reuters/Ipsos polls.</p> <p>Rasmussen said: \"The president's bounce began the night after Bill Clinton spoke to the convention and received rave reviews. Sixty-six percent of voters nationwide have a favourable opinion of the former president. Democrats overwhelmingly believe Clinton and Obama have similar views on how to fix the economy, but few Republicans and unaffiliated voters share that assessment.\"</p> <p>He said the president had made significant gains in voters aged 40-64.</p> <p>The poll Sunday comes even after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/07/obama-jobs-figures-us-election-chances\">disappointing jobs figures released Friday</a> that showed the US added just 96,000 jobs in August. Obama has spent the weekend defending his record on the economy and attacking Romney's plans. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/08/obama-romney-campaign-battleground-states\">In the swing state of Florida on Saturday</a> Obama summed Romney's platform up as: \"Tax cuts, tax cuts, gut a few regulations, some more tax cuts.\"</p> <p>In an interview aired Sunday on CBS's Face the Nation, Obama further criticised his opponent for refusing to consider tax increases on America's super-rich as a way to help reduce the deficit.</p> <p>He said:\"You can't reduce the deficit unless you take a balanced approach that says, 'We've got to make government leaner and more efficient, but we've also got to ask people \u2013 like me or governor Romney, who have done better than anybody else over the course of the last decade and whose taxes are just about lower than they've been in the last 50 years \u2013 to do a little bit more.\"</p> <p>Romney attacked Obama's record on the economy on Sunday, stating: \"This does not look like a recovery.\"</p> <p>He also tackled Democratic claims that his tax policies will favour the rich. \"We're not going to have high-income people pay less of the tax burden than they pay today. That's not what's going to happen,\" he said.<br>Romney said he would keep taxes down by closing loopholes but declined to provide an example of a loophole he would close.</p> <p>\"I can tell you that people at the high end, high-income taxpayers, are going to have fewer deductions and exemptions. Those numbers are going to come down. Otherwise they'd get a tax break. And I want to make sure people understand, despite what the Democrats said at their convention, I am not reducing taxes on high-income taxpayers,\" Romney said.</p>",
  "<p>The Republican White House ticket sought to neuter the perceived foreign policy edge of the Obama electoral campaign on Sunday, attacking the president's record whilst bragging of their own experience overseas.</p> <p>The current administration was guilty of failing to halt Iran's nuclear ambitions, Mitt Romney claimed during an interview with NBC's Face the Nation. Meanwhile, in a separate TV appearance, his running mate, Paul Ryan, was attempting to make the claim that he is better versed in foreign policy matters than Obama was four years ago, by virtue of Ryan's longer public service record in Washington.</p> <p>It represented a two-pronged approach to countering what is seen to be a Democratic advantage going into this year's election. Obama's campaign team have made much of the president's decision to pull troops out of Iraq and embark on military drawdown in Afghanistan, as well as highlight the assassination of Osama bin Laden.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Romney has made a somewhat clumsy opening gambit as a potential overseas ambassador for the US.</p> <p>In his first foreign trip as a White House candidate he offended one of America's closest allies, the UK, by criticising efforts to prepare for the Olympic Games and drew fierce criticism for suggesting while in Israel that the Palestinians' relative poverty was due to cultural differences.</p> <p>Compounding the view that Obama has an edge in terms of perceived handling of foreign policy, the Republican hopeful opened himself up to mockery in his recent convention speech in Tampa by suggesting that Russia remained the US's \"number one geo-political foe\".</p> <p>Vice-president Joe Biden has said the comment showed Romney was \"stuck in a Cold War mindset\".</p> <p>But speaking on CBS's Face the Nation, Ryan defended his running mate's comments.</p> <p>\"I think what he was saying was among the other powers, China and Russia, that Russia stands a great threat,\" he said, adding: \"Iran is our biggest foreign policy threat today\".</p> <p>The Republican vice-presidential pick also sough to push his own foreign policy credentials, boasting that he had more experience than Obama had in the run up to 2008's election.</p> <p>Challenged on what made him better qualified, considering then-senator Obama had sat on the Senate foreign relations committee, Ryan cited his 14 years in Congress.</p> <p>He added: \"I've voted to send men and women to war. I've been to Iraq and Afghanistan. I've met with our troops to get their perspectives. I've been to the funerals, I've talked to the widows, I've talked to the wives, the moms and the dads. That's something. That matters.\"</p>",
  "<p>On the eve of the battle of Borodino, the clash in 1812 that would seal the fate of Napoleon's doomed invasion, Russian generals and soldiers prayed in front of the Smolensk Icon of the Virgin Mary.</p> <p>And on Saturday the icon was taken back to the battlefield for only the second time in its history as Patriarch Kirill led a memorial service to mark the 200th anniversary of the bloody struggle.</p> <p>The only other time the icon has been paraded around the battlefield was in 1912, when Tsar Nicholas II led celebrations for the 100th anniversary. According to tradition, the holy image was brought from Jerusalem, via Byzantium, to the fledgling Russian state in the early 12th century.</p> <p>Addressing about 3,000 worshippers, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church said that only a love for one's country and a love for one's people could explain how, \"here, on this field, the Russian army withstood an army of 20 languages commanded by Napoleon\".</p> <p>President Vladimir Putin evoked the battle of Borodino as a symbol of Russian unity during his election campaign for a third term earlier this year and last weekend he watched a large re-enactment of the battle by 3,000 actors and laid a wreath in remembrance of the fallen.</p> <p>Kirill also led a service in the presence of the Smolensk Icon in Moscow's Christ the Saviour Cathedral, built to commemorate the battle on Sunday. The prayer vigil was attended by about 17,000 people, state news agency RIA-Novosti reported.</p>",

  "<p>The French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, will have 25 minutes on primetime television on Sunday evening to convince his nation that he will keep his election pledges and drag his country out of the economic mire.</p> <p>The French leader hopes the interview will halt his slide in the polls, which suggest more than half of voters are dissatisfied with him.</p> <p>Hollande is expected to talk about specific economic and social issues. He will also reassure voters that he will press ahead with controversial election pledges, including higher taxes for the rich. French newspapers suggest the president may also announce new taxes to bring in an extra \u20ac15bn (\u00a312bn).</p> <p>\"The tone will be serious,\" a member of the presidential entourage told the Journal du Dimanche (JDD). \"He has about a half an hour to convince the French there's a chief at the head of state who has a vision, a destination and a timescale for getting there.\"</p> <p>Hollande's popularity has plummeted, with the majority of French people having lost faith in his election promises, according to a poll in le Parisien newspaper on Sunday. The president's rating has dropped 22 percentage points to 40% from a previous poll two weeks after he took up office on 16 May, it found. Dissatisfaction with his leadership has risen to 59%, the survey added.</p> <p>Hollande sold himself to the French electorate as \"Monsieur Normal\", a contrast to the hyper-presidency of his predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy. En route to an official engagement a week ago, he ordered his chauffeur to stop at a petrol station so he could have a coffee and chat with lorry drivers to gauge the national mood. Now, however, his determination to appear ordinary has been interpreted as a symptom of chronic indecision and inaction.</p> <p>Some have suggested the president needs to appear more pushy.</p> <p>On Friday, the Socialist government insisted that key election pledges, including spending cuts and reforms that would see a 75%tax rate for anyone earning more than \u20ac1m a year, were not being watered down. The high tax rate was a \"symbolic measure that people expect and that means a lot to the country\", said a presidential aide.</p> <p>Hollande will remind voters that his country's stagnant economy and the eurozone crisis make it vital for France to reduce its public deficit to 3% of gross domestic product next year or risk a loss of investors' trust and a possible credit rating downgrade.</p> <p>\"The French know that difficult decisions have to be made. They want to hear their president,\" the adviser said. \"He is obliged to raise French people's concerns, which are real, and to say: 'Here is what I am doing, here is what is being done, here is where I am taking you.'\"</p> <p>Elys\u00e9e advisers say the president hopes to dispel the impression that he is \"immobile\" in the face of the country's economic woes, but may not make any specific new policy statement. In the interview he will stress that he has only a \"small spade\" to dig the country out of its economic problem, they said.</p> <p>\"The French approve of what he is doing, but they are perplexed about where it's going, that's to say the direction and what it means, and it is this he will try to address,\" one of the president's team told the JDD.</p>"
