  "<p>There is a glaring paradox about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jul/30/pussy-riot-trial-vladimir-putin\" title=\"\">the crackdown</a> Vladimir Putin has launched since being elected president for a third term. If Putin commands majority support \u2013 a recent poll found that more than 33% want Putin to stay beyond 2018 for a fourth term \u2013 and if the opposition that filled the streets of Moscow and St Petersburg almost a year ago is by its own admission unable to present an alternative, why is Putin resorting to methods of repression unseen since Soviet days?</p> <p>Methods such as this: an <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/ukraine-fire-russian-activists-abduction-17561490#.UI0bo7_YeIY\" title=\"\">activist who had fled to Kiev</a> to seek political asylum was kidnapped, maltreated for two days and told that if he did not sign a confession implicating fellow leaders of the socialist Left Front, Sergei Udaltsov and Konstantin Lebedev, his children would be killed. Udaltsov and Lebedev are being investigated for \"plotting mass unrest\" and face up to 10 years in prison. Other more Machiavellian methods are used. The prison <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/17/pussy-riot-sentenced-prison-putin\" title=\"\">sentences meted out</a> to the feminist punk band Pussy Riot amounted to such an operation. At first there seemed to be little logic to it: the general prosecutor took no action when one of the jailed women, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/25/putin-pussy-riot-western-hypocrisy\" title=\"\">took part in the group orgy</a> in Moscow's natural history museum in 2008. And yet when the same woman performed an anti-Putin song in a near-empty Moscow cathedral late at night, hell's fury was unleashed.</p> <p>Someone in Putin's inner circle sensed an opportunity to turn the tables on a protest movement fired up by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/04/russia-elections-putin-editorial\" title=\"\">rigged parliamentary elections</a> last year. A conflict which had until then pitted the young, urban middle class against an ageing, corrupt and super-rich bureaucracy, was diverted into the challenge of a fringe group against a self-defined moral majority. Of Russians recently polled by the Levada Centre, <a href=\"http://vaticaninsider.lastampa.it/en/world-news/detail/articolo/russia-rusia-ortodossi-orthodox-christians-ortodoxos-18966/\" title=\"\">fully 79% described themselves as orthodox believers</a>. Part of the church that had started to air unease about Putin suddenly turned against the protest movement and Pussy Riot became a gift for him. Putin also weakened the opposition by appearing to give it what it wanted: allowing parties to be formed without artificially high <a href=\"http://valdaiclub.com/politics/48662.html\" title=\"\">registration hurdles</a>. The result was to swamp recent regional elections in spoiler parties which splintered opposition support. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/15/vladimir-putin-hails-russia-election\" title=\"\">incumbent governors were re-elected</a> in each of the five regions in which they were held.</p> <p>The conflicts Putin has generated since his re-election \u2013 youth versus the orthodox church, liberals versus conservatives, westerners versus nationalists \u2013 all stoke the motor of anti-Americanism. America is officially a partner. Putin says so both publicly, and privately to Barack Obama when they last <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/18/obama-putin-syria-meeting\" title=\"\">met at Los Cabos</a> in Mexico. Those are words, but as far as deeds are concerned, the US representatives in Russia are treated like the enemy within, their motives suspect, their aid agency closed, their diplomats subject to intrusive surveillance.</p> <p>These are tactics, and Putin is a tactician, not a master strategist. But none of them answer the real question: why go to these lengths? Why shut down the internet when the opposition were inviting votes for a body intended to serve as a collective leadership, its Co-ordination Council? The <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20037209\" title=\"\">process garnered fewer than 100,000</a> votes nationwide. Why not take such an embryonic movement in its stride? Putin's crackdown has Russia watchers scratching their heads. There are conflicting theories: he is vindictive; he is bored, disengaged and out of touch; he is more insecure than he seems.</p> <p>The last thesis bears scrutiny. It goes like this: the real struggle being played out is not the visible war against activists in the courts, but the invisible internecine tussle between rival groups of advisers in his circle. As the stability Putin managed to achieve in his first two terms turns to stagnation in his third, his authority is being challenged from within. A crackdown, selectively applied, skilfully manipulated, is Putin's temporary and tactical answer. But it will do nothing to tackle the source of his problems \u2013 a corrupt, inflexible, unreformable system of government to which his name and fate are inextricably attached.</p>",
  "<p>Matt Frei has himself a pick-up truck; he's hitting the road, going in search of the American Dream. \"Somewhere along the line I know there'll be girls, visions, everything,\" he says dreamily, arm hanging louchely out of the open window. \"Somewhere along the line the pearl will be handed to me.\"</p> <p>Oh, sorry, no he doesn't, my mistake; that's Sal in On The Road. But Frei does seem to be feeling the freedom of the open road, released from the seriousness of being a serious Channel 4 news person (Washington correspondent, now presenter).</p> <p>This \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-american-road-trip-obamas-story\" title=\"\"><strong>The American Roadtrip: Obama's Story</strong></a> (Channel 4, Sunday) \u2013 is serious television; Frei is testing the temperature in the crucial midwest swing states ahead of next week's election. But he does have a Dodge Ram 1500 dual cab. He can let himself go a bit, put on a pair of sunnies, lose the tie. It's a bit like bumping into your teacher during the holidays, at the beach.</p> <p>And there may not be pearls or visions, but there are girls. There's Glenda, his \"road trip mistress\", she who must be obeyed, otherwise known as the sat nav. \"No, darling, I'm not going to turn left on highway 280, I'm going to carry on on this one,\" says Matt with masterly authority. And there's Karen, a Mormon elder, whose knickers Matt wants to talk about, her magic Mormon knickers (because of Mitt Romney's faith). They're an expression of her covenant with God, says Karen. Do men and women wear them? Yes. Does she wear them? Yes.</p> <p>Matt's got Karen's pants between his teeth now, so to speak. He's shaking his head from side to side like a terrier; he's not going to let go until he's got to the bottom of them, so to speak. Does she find it awkward talking about her underwear? It's not something they usually talk about. Wouldn't it be better just to put them out there? Oh Matt, just ask her if you can see her knickers, you clearly want to. To be honest, I do, too. What do sacred Mormon pants look like? I'm guessing, given that the idea is to ward off temptation not beckon it, that they're not like the sort that come from Agent Provocateur.</p> <p>Matt doesn't ask. But he does ask other brave questions. In Northwood, Iowa, he asks a gun shop owner whose phone ringtone is the sound of an AK47 what this election is all about.</p> <p>In Kentucky, he asks a Tea party Bible basher if he hates Obama because he's black. In Gary, Indiana, he asks a man if Mitt Romney is a brother by another mother, slightly embarrassingly.</p> <p>This is \"fly-over America\", the bit in the middle that most visitors don't get to see. Where the second amendment is a basic human right. Where \"Yurr-rup\" is mistrusted, an insignificant place a long way away, probably somewhere between \"Eye-raq\" and North Korea. Where once great industrial towns lie crumbling and abandoned. Where, these days, a middle-class couple has to work 100 hours a week between them just to keep the bailiffs from the door. Where the next generation is going to struggle to be better off than this one. Where the American Dream is dying and Obama's health-care reforms aren't going to save it.</p> <p>It's a fascinating place, even though it's often a forgotten place. Except in the runup to a presidential</p> <p>election. When it suddenly becomes just about the most important place in the whole&#xa0;world.</p> <p>Speaking of important places, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00v36y1\" title=\"\"><strong>Harry&#xa0;&amp; Paul</strong></a> (BBC2, Sunday) seem to have moved to my north-west London manor. Oi, that's the bus stop up the road. \"What a wonderful place Willesden is,\" says Victoria Wood who joins in to play, alongside Harry, a pair of minor royals, visiting a corner shop in a less salubrious part of town than they're used to. It's one of the hits.</p> <p>What, hit and miss? A sketch show? Really? Of course it is. You could even argue that this kind of traditional sketch show shouldn't have much of a future. But television would be poorer without Harry &amp; Paul, because it can be&#xa0;so good.</p> <p>It's not about the gags \u2013 if you looked at the script, you would probably just think: eh? It's all about the characters, and the interaction of the characters. Enfield and Whitehouse don't just dress up and put on silly voices, they possess their characters. The hits are big hits. \"Probable quare\" still makes me laugh. And the one at the end where it all goes Nordic noir is&#xa0;a joy.</p>",
  "<p>The four-day ceasefire that went into effect on Friday should have been the first good news from Syria for several months. The initiative came from Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN and Arab League's special envoy, and was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middle-east-live/2012/oct/25/syria-conflict-ceasefire-doubts-live\" title=\"\">accepted by Bashar al-Assad's government</a> as well as several opposition commanders.</p> <p>Two Islamist groups rejected it outright and both sides put conditions on it. The government said it would respond to rebel attacks and the rebels said the government should not resupply its troops. The rebels seemed to be particularly sceptical of any ceasefire since they appear to believe the military momentum is with them, and they have always been wary of political negotiations unless Assad first resigns.</p> <p>Although <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/27/syrian-rebels-kurds-clash-aleppo\" title=\"\">ceasefire violations</a> have been numerous, there has been a slight overall drop in military activity. Reports from Aleppo suggest the city has been quieter and in other places people had a brief respite, especially on the first day. UN agencies, working with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, had pre-positioned tons of aid for displaced families and were able to dispatch two convoys to Homs. Dozens of Syrian civil society groups have been working to get medicine, food and blankets to the informal shelters where homeless families are living in and around Damascus and Aleppo.</p> <p>Aleppo has been the focus of terrible recent clashes. It has fallen victim to the worst destruction of any major city in the world since 1945. Over a third of its 2 million residents may have fled. According to Haytham Manna, the head of the National Co-ordination Body for Democratic Change in Syria, Aleppo's tragedy began when rebels attacked the city without having the strength to win it; whole districts were then destroyed by government counterattacks.</p> <p>Manna lives in Paris but the rest of his 25-person executive lead opposition groups inside Syria. They still believe the best way to remove the Assad regime is through a ceasefire and a political settlement that provides for a democratic transition in which state institutions are reformed, not destroyed. They condemn the government's indiscriminate use of air power in built-up areas but are aware of growing civilian criticism of rebel tactics. Manna even claims to detect signs of fatigue among the armed opposition.</p> <p>He and his colleagues inside Syria consider diplomatic intervention the only solution. Russia and the US must reach a consensus to halt arms supplies and put pressure on each side to have a long-lasting ceasefire. This would be followed by negotiations between the Syrian parties as well as talks among Syria's neighbours to guarantee no outside power would undermine the transition to a new system. It is a tall order. In their recent debates Romney and Obama produced the usual formulas that have yielded no breakthrough yet: Assad must go now, sanctions must be tightened, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/08/mitt-romney-arm-syrian-rebels?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">support must increase for the armed opposition</a> while ensuring weapons only go to \"moderates\". There was no mention of ceasefires, the UN, Brahimi, or a political solution.</p> <p>On the Syrian government side there are severe obstacles. The ceasefire track is not new. Before Brahimi took over Kofi Annan's team had tried to negotiate truces in Homs, Rustan and Deir el-Zour. Assad claimed to agree but his generals vetoed the plans. Since then the regime's security chiefs have launched air attacks and new massacres in districts on the edge of Damascus. Now come this weekend's ceasefire violations. Like some of the rebels, the generals still believe military victory is possible.</p> <p>They have also poisoned the atmosphere for talks, even if it means snubbing Russia, China and Iran. After Russian pressure the government allowed Manna's group to hold a conference in Damascus last month. But the day before it opened, one of the group's leaders, Abdelaziz al-Khayer, and two colleagues were detained by troops of the Airforce Intelligence, the most feared of the security agencies. Repeated inquiries by Russian, Chinese and Iranian diplomats have not yet produced their release.</p> <p>Once the US election is over, Washington needs to change policy. One-sided support for the armed opposition condemns Syrians to months, perhaps years, of bloodshed. A Libya-style intervention would be a worse escalation. Far better to junk the failed strategy both candidates followed in last week's debate and work with Russia and Brahimi on a permanent ceasefire. Whatever disputes Obama has with Putin on other issues, he needs to work with the Kremlin on Syria rather than provoke it.</p>",
  "<p>If you've been wondering what comedian Roseanne Barr is up to these days, we have your answer: she's running for president. No, really. <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/08/08/roseanne-barr-why-you-should-vote-for-me-for-president.html\" title=\"\">Roseanne is the official presidential nominee</a> for <a href=\"http://www.peaceandfreedom.org/home/\" title=\"\">The Peace and Freedom Party</a>, which in the past has fielded such candidates as Black Panther leader <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/02/us/eldridge-cleaver-black-panther-who-became-gop-conservative-is-dead-at-62.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm\" title=\"\">Eldridge Cleaver</a> and baby care expert <a href=\"http://www.drspock.com/\" title=\"\">Dr Benjamin Spock</a>. She is running on a platform that promises to legalise marijuana and forgive student loan debt, among other things.</p> <p>If news of her campaign passed you by, don't feel bad. Roseanne is only on the ballot in three states: California, Colorado and Florida. She is also a registered \"write-in\" candidate in 20 more states, meaning you can scribble in her name even though she's not listed on the ballot. This provision is available in many states. The first time I voted I wrote myself in as a candidate for high bailiff of Addison County, Vermont (the Republican incumbent was running unopposed). I didn't win, so I never had to find out what a high bailiff is.</p> <p>The main reason why there aren't more alternative, protest, single-issue, leftfield or downright frivolous presidential candidates is the difficulty of getting on the ballot in all 50 states. Each state has its own procedures for ballot access, ranging from \"lax\" to \"obstructionist\". Colorado is among the easiest: besides Roseanne, there are 15 other presidential candidates listed on this year's ballot. In Louisiana, you can get on by paying $500 or collecting 5,000 signatures \u2013 your choice. Other states ask for signatures equivalent to a certain percentage of the total vote in the last election \u2013 this year Georgia required 51,845.</p> <p>In the upcoming election only five \"third\" parties have ballot access equivalent to 270 electoral college votes \u2013 that is, they're on the ballot in enough states to have at least a theoretical chance of winning. One is the Green party, whose candidate, <a href=\"http://www.jillstein.org/\" title=\"\">Jill Stein</a>, beat Roseanne to win the nomination. Another party, called <a href=\"http://www.americanselect.org/\" title=\"\">Americans Elect,</a> is fielding no candidates because nobody reached their own minimum requirement of 1,000 online votes.</p> <p>Below the 270-line are various socialist factions and America's oldest third party, the <a href=\"http://www.prohibitionists.org/\" title=\"\">Prohibition party</a>, founded in 1869. Its temperance message doesn't have as much traction as it used to: in the 2008 presidential election its candidate received 643 votes nationwide. There is also an <a href=\"http://www.objectivistparty.us/\" title=\"\">Objectivist party</a>, which promotes a philosophical system developed by novelist Ayn Rand.</p> <p>Individual write-in candidates rarely get anywhere, although there are notable exceptions at the congressional and state level. In 1998, <a href=\"http://www.charlotteburks.com/\" title=\"\">Charlotte Burks</a> was elected to the Tennessee state senate on write-in votes after her husband, the official candidate, was murdered by his Republican opponent.</p> <p>In 1980, rock singer <a href=\"http://www.joewalsh.com/\" title=\"\">Joe Walsh</a> ran a write-in presidential campaign, on a platform promising \"Free Gas For Everyone\". It's just as well he didn't win \u2013 he was 33 at the time, and therefore not legally old enough to be president.</p>",
  "<p>With its steel and plate glass facade, the interactive entertainment academy at the University of Central Florida looks as far from the grassy quadrangle and belltower of a traditional college as it's possible to get.</p> <p>Inside, small teams of students \u2013 artists, computer programmers and aspiring games producers \u2013 collaborate to acquire the skills needed to work in the video games industry. In one studio, a trio of students have created an iPad version of an Angry Birds-style game that involves firing dodos from a cannon.</p> <p>Kyle Martin, lead artist on the dodo game, had borrowed $33,000 in a federal loan to pay for his year's tuition.</p> <p>\"FIEA has a really great success rate in terms of who gets hired,\" he said. \"That by itself proves it's a great investment.\"</p> <p>The campus is in Orlando, a city that is best known for its proximity to the world's most popular amusement park but is increasingly a centre for hi-tech industry, film, TV and gaming.</p> <p>Ben Noel, director of the interactive entertainment academy, said: \"Orlando has grown up around agriculture and tourism, low wage jobs. The people who had opportunities around here were the children of bankers, real estate lawyers and real estate developers.</p> <p>\"As we grow, there's very much a focus on economic development and high wage jobs. We're trying to build that infrastructure.\"</p> <p>The US has one of the most highly educated workforces in the developed world. Across all age groups, only Canada, Israel, Japan and Russia have a higher proportion of college-educated workers. But many countries are catching up fast as more young people around the globe get an opportunity to go to university.</p> <p>According to the OECD, 42% of young Americans have a college education _ far behind the world leader, Korea, where 65% of young people have a degree.</p> <p>On current trends, the US will be overtaken by an increasing number of countries in coming years.</p> <p>In a flatter world, that creates competitive pressure. The Obama administration has set a goal that, by 2020, the US will have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world.</p> <p>Democrats and Republicans agree that college should be more affordable and accessible, but differ on how to achieve this.</p> <p>President Obama has raised the maximum Pell grant award available in the next academic year. The grant, intended for the neediest students, is the federal government's single biggest expenditure on education; of the 16.4m undergraduates at US colleges in 2010, <a href=\"http://www.popecenter.org/inquiry_papers/article.html?id=2704\">58% received Pell grants</a>.</p> <p>Mitt Romney argues that increased federal funding will feed the growth in college costs. He has indicated a narrowing of the Pell grant programme, saying that \"a Romney administration will refocus Pell grant dollars on the students that need them most\". Romney says that he will support \"institutions that are pursuing innovative operating models to drive down costs\".</p> <p>Obama acknowledges the need to curb college costs, but favours using federal money as an incentive for good behaviour. He has proposed that some federal aid will be shifted away from colleges that fail to hold down net tuition \u2013 the costs paid by students after taking grants into account. The money, $10bn annually, will be used to reward colleges that \"do their fair share\" to keep tuition affordable, the president says.</p> <p>Obama lobbied Congress this summer to extend the low interest rate on federal student loans, a move that was backed by Romney. Congress voted to extend the 3.4% rate on Stafford loans for another year - the interest rate would otherwise have doubled.</p> <p>Meanwhile, state funding for public universities is under intense pressure. State government budgets have been squeezed by spending on programmes like Medicaid, the healthcare scheme for the poor. Universities, which can plug their funding gap by charging students more for tuition, are obvious targets for spending cuts.</p> <p>Between 1992 and 2010, state funding dropped from 38% of public universities' total revenue to an average of 23%. Enrolment at public universities has gone up while state funding has fallen by 20% per student in the past decade, according to the National Science Board, which advises the government on science policy.</p> <p>The erosion of state support is keenly felt at the University of Central Florida. With over 50,000 students enroled, it is the second largest university in the US, after Arizona State.</p> <p>Last year, for the first time, the university's share of funding from tuition exceeded the proportion it received from the state. In Florida as a whole, public funding per student has fallen by 19% in the past decade, according to the National Science Board figures.</p> <p>University provost Tony Waldrop said: \"One of our goals is to provide access to students who are qualified to go to college. We don't see our job as to figure out how to deny people a college degree but rather to provide access to that opportunity.</p> <p>\"We could just cap enrolment, and then we wouldn't have this problem, but if we cap enrolment that by definition means we're going to deny students an opportunity to get a college education without going out of state.\"</p> <p>Instead, the university has cut courses, increased class sizes and is offering more education online. A third of UCF's student credit hours \u2013 which count towards graduation \u2013 are either completely or partially online, the provost says. This figure grows every year.</p> <p>Waldrop said: \"At a time when we were growing very rapidly, and growing rapidly so we could meet the demand for access to colleges here in Florida, we were also getting cuts, so the biggest impact has been not being able to hire faculty at the same rate we were increasing in size. So something we're concerned about is our student to faculty ratio is not where we would like it to be.\"</p> <p>Average class sizes are now between 40 and 48 students, the university's management estimates. Five courses, ranging from radiology to actuarial science, have gone \u2013 in some cases because of low enrolments but also because they were available at local community colleges. It remains a comprehensive university offering a vast array of courses from art history to neuroscience. The giant main campus - featuring a 10,000 seat arena where graduation ceremonies are held - feels like a self-contained citadel within Orlando.</p> <p>A further squeeze on government funding; if, for example, eligibility for Pell grants is narrowed, could have a serious impact on the university's mission.</p> <p>\"If the Pell grant programme is limited, disadvantaged students are not going to be able to afford to come to UCF,\" the provost said. \"And if they can't afford UCF \u2013 we're already one of the cheapest in the country.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398481679\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/28/1351447514396/florida-education-010.jpg\" alt=\"florida education\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At UCF, tuition fees for the current academic year are just under $6,000 for Florida residents on undergraduate courses.

Romney wants to encourage private provision of college education, indicating that he will deregulate this sector.</p> <p>The candidates' attitude to private for-profit colleges has emerged as an effective dividing line in the presidential race. The Obama administration has passed regulations that require for-profit colleges to <a href=\"http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/gainful-employment-regulations\">demonstrate \"gainful employment\"</a> among their graduates \u2013 the measures include being able to demonstrate that at least 35% of former students are actively paying down loans.</p> <p>Romney has said he will do away with this \"ill-advised regulation\". The Romney plan says: \"the federal government should allow consumers in the market to make their own choices while providing the information to make those choices well.\"</p> <p>A Romney remark that students should \"shop around\" and borrow more money from their parents was seized on in Democrat campaign ads as an example of the gap between the Republican candidate and ordinary lives. The president has portrayed himself and his wife as beneficiaries of affordable state-backed education.</p> <p>On the campaign trail <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF_9r6-DLTw\">Romney has praised</a> the for-profit Full Sail University in Winter Park, Florida, noting that they run classes 24 hours a day \"because physical structure is expensive\".</p> <p>Romney said: \"They hold down the cost of their education by recognising they're competing. We're going to have to have greater competition among institutions of higher learning and I believe that they're going to have to become productive.</p> <p>\"Two of the places that are least productive in our society, have done less to improve their cost and quality are healthcare and higher education. Bringing the dynamics of competition to those marketplaces in my view is the best way to bring down cost.\"</p> <h2>A private model with higher tuition </h2> <p>Full Sail, which is less than seven miles from UCF, <a href=\"http://www.fullsail.edu/outcomes-and-statistics\">has steeper tuition rates</a> than the public university. A degree course in Digital Arts and Design, for example, costs $80,000 for a 21 month course.</p> <p>However, a spokeswoman argued that as the university's courses are taken at an accelerated pace, students saved on living costs.</p> <p>She said: \"Our students are potentially in their career earlier, they've saved money on up to two additional years of living as a college student, and they've been more aggressively prepared for the non-stop pace of the entertainment industry.\"</p> <p>Full Sail is a specialist institution focused on the entertainment industry; its alumni include an Oscar winner, Gary Rizzo, who was honoured for his sound mixing work on the Christopher Nolan film Inception. <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2047078,00.html\">At last year's Grammys</a>, the five nominees were all mixed or engineered by Full Sail graduates.</p> <p>It offers students lavish facilities \u2013 there are more than a dozen sound stages to shoot film and television, music recording studios that meet professional standards, and outdoor movie sets recreating Amsterdam, Venice and New York. Its website publishes detailed statistics about student outcomes, including how many get jobs in their chosen profession \u2013 for the digital arts and design course, the success rate was 78% of the 222 students who graduated in 2009-10.</p> <p>Full Sail provides a fast track into the entertainment business for many of its students, but its high tuition costs mean it is unlikely to provide a realistic alternative for students from less affluent homes.</p> <p>Asked about the university's student profile, the spokeswoman said: \"We do not track the socio-economic background of our students and we do not encourage or discourage students based on their socio-economic background. Also, due to our student privacy policy, we do not publish information of this nature.\"</p> <p>Like the music industry and the media, traditional universities face a challenge from the disruptive power of the internet. Increasingly, traditional universities have felt the need to cover their internet flank by offering courses online. Harvard and MIT have launched the edX platform while a number of elite universities including Princeton and Johns Hopkins have joined the online education platform Coursera. The provost of UCF accepts that the expansion of virtual learning will provide mounting competition for universities like his.</p> <p>Waldrop said: \"I think our competition increasingly will come from online education and different ways of doing it that may or may not lead to degrees. I don't think we've seen the impact of that yet.\"</p> <p>Teenagers will always require a rite of passage into adulthood, and that is part of what universities provide. But as online education grows, the solution to America's college debt problem might bring with it the dissolution of the physical campus and library.</p>",

If Obama wins it will to some extent be thanks to his Hollywood genie.</p> <p>\"Katzenberg recognised early that without the support of the entertainment industry's millionaires and billionaires, Obama would have a tough time getting re-elected,\" said Tina Daunt of the Hollywood Reporter. \"He became Obama's top advocate in the industry \u2013 simply because others were not willing to go all out for the president.\"</p> <p>Katzenberg has spent more than $3m (\u00a31.85m) of his own fortune on the contest, making him Obama's top donor, followed by Irwin Jacobs, the founder of semiconductor maker Qualcomm, Fred Eychaner, a newspaper publisher, and Jon Stryker, heir to the equipment manufacturer Stryker Corp.</p> <p>In addition to dipping into his personal fortune, estimated by Forbes at $800m, Katzenberg has almost single-handedly persuaded much of Hollywood to again back the president.</p> <p>With the election expected to cost a record-breaking $2bn, and with Wall Street and conservative billionaires backing Mitt Romney, Katzenberg has helped level the field.</p> <p>It was not easy. Hollywood's 2008 ardour for Obama cooled amid frustration over slow or absent progress on climate change, Guant\u00e1namo Bay, gay rights and other liberal causes. The White House's siding with Silicon Valley in a dispute over online piracy, which drains Hollywood profits, made things worse. \"People here were disappointed and disillusioned,\" said Daunt. \"They complained that he wasn't moving fast enough on their key concerns. Though he eventually came around on these issues, Hollywood didn't think he was showing enough passion and fight. Katzenberg stepped into the political void created by that disenchantment.\"</p> <p>Skip Paul, a Hollywood media financier and neighbour of Katzenberg, told the Wall Street Journal that the studio boss phoned his targets directly. \"He says: 'I really want you to help me on something that's important to me.' And if he doesn't get you the first time, he calls and gets you the second time. It's very personal, and it's not phoney.\"</p> <p>Katzenberg has been terse with the media over such activism \u2013 his office and Andy Spahn, his political consultant, did not respond to an interview request \u2013 but his interventions have been well documented. He helped two former White House staffers, Bill Burton and Sean Sweeney, set up <a href=\"http://www.prioritiesusaaction.org/\" title=\"\">Priorities USA</a>, a political action committee (Super Pac) to counter multiplying, well-funded Republican Super Pacs.</p> <p>He gave $2m in seed money and other entertainment figures such as Morgan Freeman and Bill Maher each donated $1m. He also organised a $40,000-per-head dinner at George Clooney's house which raised $15m.</p> <p>Priorities USA raised $15.25m in September, its highest monthly total, boosted by an additional $1m from Katzenberg and $1m from Steven Spielberg, his DreamWorks partner. It helped fund an 11th-hour advertising blitz in swing states.</p> <p>Obama took time out from hectic campaigning for a <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/barack-obama-bill-clinton-jeffrey-katzenberg-los-angeles-democrats-376968\" title=\"\">thank you luncheon with the former president Bill Clinton and a dozen donors at Katzenberg's Beverly Hills home on 7 October</a>.</p> <p>Later that evening Katzenberg co-hosted a $25,000 per ticket dinner for Obama at Wolfgang Puck's restaurant in the Ritz Carlton in Los Angeles.</p> <p>In his speech the president singled out Katzenberg and his wife, Marilyn, for thanks. \"They have been tireless and stalwart and have never wavered through good times and bad since my first presidential race, back when a lot of people still couldn't pronounce my name. <a href=\"http://www.deadline.com/2012/10/barack-obama-in-la-today-for-jeffrey-katzenberg-meeting-with-bill-clinton-nokia-theatre-concert-donor-dinner/\" title=\"\">I will always be grateful to them</a>.\"</p> <p>Katzenberg is not noted for diplomacy. A hard-charging New Yorker who worked his way up from Paramount, where he revived the Star Trek franchise, he fell out with his mentor Michael Eisner at Disney before setting up DreamWorks with Spielberg and David Geffen, another Obama supporter. He was impressed enough by Obama's 2004 Democratic convention speech, and subsequent private meetings, to back the Illinois senator against Hillary Clinton, until then Hollywood's favourite candidate.</p> <p>Katzenberg protected White House ties to Hollywood by <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">encouraging Obama to phone studio heads ruffled by the piracy decision</a>.</p> <p>He reportedly said he expected nothing in return for his services, and few doubt he is motivated by political conviction. However it was noted the state department seated him near China's vice president, Xi Jinping, at a Washington lunch in February. Hollywood is keen to expand market share in China.</p> <p>Democrats may no longer call Obama's presidency a fairytale but that does not stop them wishing for a happy ending on 6 November \u2013 thanks in part to the movie mogul behind Aladdin.</p> <h2>Flying the flag for Romney<br></h2> <p>Republicans may consider Hollywood enemy territory ruled by liberals but a slew of politically conservative films are attacking Obama and praising rightwing virtues in the runup to the election.</p> <p>Dinesh D'Souza's documentary, 2016: Obama's America, has blazed the way by grossing $33m at the box office in past months, making it the most successful political documentary after Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11. It recently became available on DVD.</p> <p>Atlas Shrugged: Part II, the second part of a trilogy based on Ayn Rand's paean to plutocrats, limped into cinemas this month amid stinking reviews but Fox News gamely reported that \"<a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2012/10/12/atlas-shrugged-part-ii-kept-from-mainstream-movie-critics-but-public-interest/\" title=\"\">public interest remains high</a>\".</p> <p>Hating Breitbart, a biographical documentary by Andrew Marcus about the late conservative culture warrior Andrew Breitbart, hit screens last week.</p> <p>Runaway Slave, a documentary about black conservatives, flopped when it opened in July but is to be re-released on the back of enthusiasm for 2016.</p> <p>Obama may have Clooney and Scarlett Johansson but Romney boasts his own celebrity endorsements. Clint Eastwood has followed up the Republican convention's empty chair sketch with an ad which declares: \"<a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-pn-obama-romney-clint-eastwood-20121026,0,4478311.story\" title=\"\">Obama's second term would be a rerun of the first and our country just couldn't survive that.</a>\"</p> <p>Meat Loaf endorsed Romney at a rally in Ohio, saying: \"There is one man who will stand tall in this country and fight the storm and bring the United States back to what it should be \u2013 Governor Mitt Romney.\"</p> <p>Hollywood's conservatives raised $6m for the Republican candidate at a Beverly Hills fundraiser in September which drew, among others, the producer Jerry Bruckheimer and the actors Gary Sinise, of CSI: NY, and Patricia Heaton, of Everyone Loves Raymond.</p>",
  "<p>There are few places in America where the dividing line in the 2012 election is as clear as the desolate stretch of Harrison Avenue on the outskirts of Canton, Ohio. On one side of the street is the smoke-belching Timken steel plant, its owners generous contributors to the Republicans. On the other, four of the workers, members of the steel union, distribute leaflets on behalf of Barack Obama.</p> <p>It was just after dawn on the first bitterly cold day of autumn and, even clad in hats and heavy jackets, they were shivering. But no one was complaining. They were on a mission, handing out pro-Democrat leaflets to sleepy-eyed, largely uninterested workers coming off the night shift and others about to start the day shift.</p> <p>\"The only motivation I need for getting out early in the morning is knowing this election will decide whether organised labour still exists afterwards in this country or not. This election could erase 50 to 60 years of struggle by organised labour,\" said Joe Sterling, 48, one of the four. A former carpenter who became a steelworker, he has been on leave since May working full-time on the campaign.</p> <p>Harrison Avenue provides a powerful image of how polarised this election has become, especially between the classes. But Timken's importance lies not in the symbolism but in its location, one of the biggest employers in Stark County, among the most intensely fought-over areas in the whole of America. How Stark County votes is usually how Ohio votes and Ohio looks as if it will decide who will be the next White House incumbent.</p> <p>It is too close to call and the numbers of volunteers out for Obama is down on 2008 \u2013 as is the level of enthusiasm. \"I am nervous,\" said Susie Camper, 69, another one of the four outside the gates. She had been up since 5.30am to get to the factory in time to leaflet. \"It is kind of scary if Romney becomes president.\"</p> <p>Camper, Sterling and tens of thousands of other union members like them across the country are putting in long days in the swing states, working the phone banks and going door to door.</p> <p>In terms of volunteers and financial donations, the unions are one of Obama's biggest assets, the shadow army to his official campaign teams.</p> <p>The union contribution tends to go largely unrecognised, their role in the campaign mainly ignored by the media, and with little in the way of thanks afterwards from Obama and the politicians they help into office. \"Unions have become a dirty word,\" one union official said.</p> <p>It was not always so. American unions have a proud history, at least as far as those on the left are concerned: from the violent clashes in the pits and steelworks across Pennsylvania at the latter part of 19th century to the New York garment workers' strike at the start of the 20th century, the unions were the key to winning decent wages and working conditions. The unions peaked in the 1950s, with about 30% of the workforce signed up.</p> <p>Today, membership has dropped dramatically, down to only 11%, partly a result of the highly publicised stories of corruption in the 1950s and 60s, especially those involving the Teamsters, and partly as a result of anti-union legislation, a creeping process brought in by Republican governors and legislatures. Now 23 out of the 50 states are \"right-to-work\", with laws that prohibit unions from requiring non-members to pay dues.</p> <p>The fear of the unions is that if Romney wins the White House, this process will accelerate.</p> <p>\"What we are witnessing is corporate greed out of control,\" said Kathleen Kelly-Calcei, 55, a full-time official with the AFL-CIO, the federation representing 56 unions. Kelly-Calcei runs the campaign war room in Canton, one of about a score of AFL-CIO field offices in Ohio. A poster near the entrance sums up her uncompromising spirit: \"Go Hard or Go Home.\"</p> <p>\"I fear Romney will go in for the kill with federal legislation. I definitely think he is committed to those who are funding him to get rid of the unions. It will be devastating. There will be no one standing in the way of the corporations.\"</p> <p>Kelly-Calcei and others cite as evidence the way the Republicans, after wins in the 2010 mid-term elections, immediately moved to introduce anti-union legislation in Wisconsin, Indiana and elsewhere.</p> <p>If unions are in decline, then why, union officials ask, are they the number one target for Republicans? A steel union official in Canton, Joe Hoagland, 57, has one answer. Workers at Timken earn about $20-$23.50 an hour. Without the unions, workers would be earning $12 an hour, as they do in the \"right-to-work\" states in the South, Hoagland said.</p> <p>Another reason is that an attack on the unions is an attack on the Democratic party. Without union money, the Democrats would be struggling to match the Republicans. The unions are coy about how much they contribute but estimates run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. One union alone, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said in the summer it planned to spend $100m.</p> <p>The union contributions are not just in terms of direct donations or paying for expensive ads in the swing states, but in terms of hours.</p> <p>The United Steelworkers alone is deploying 600 of its full-time staff and paying the wages and health insurance for 150 workers such as Sterling who have taken time off work to help. On top of this, the union has lots of unpaid volunteers, an estimated 10,000, each working at least a three-hour shift each week.</p> <p>\"Our goal is to have 11 contacts from the union with every member. In some places, it is 14,\" Tim Waters, national political director of the steelworkers' union, said.</p> <p>Obama campaign offices across the US attract a lot of young, affluent and college-educated staff and volunteers. Those running the parallel union operations tend to be predominantly working-class, more inclined to openly display their passion, more direct and more inclined to argue.</p> <p>The four outside Timken knew most of the workers going in and out, and their leaflets are mostly accepted, either out of shared conviction or just politeness. Others decline, more interested in getting to their cars and home or because they are Republicans. An estimated 30% of all union members across the country will vote Republican.</p> <p>Another of the four outside Timken, Scott Jacob, 57, a furnace operator, got into an argument with a Romney-supporting worker. It was the kind of exchange unlikely to be replicated by one of the young middle-class Obama staffers, who are told not to argue with voters.</p> <p>\"I told him if he votes Romney, he would see what happens to social security and Medicare benefits. He said he did not think that would happen,\" Jacob said. \"I told him: 'Bend over. You are going to get screwed if you vote for Romney.'\"</p> <p>This uncompromising approach to campaigning is evident too in union ads. An ad paid for by a group linked to the AFL-CIO launched last week accused Romney of being \"an economic traitor\".</p> <p>What do companies such as Timken get if Republicans win? A more business-friendly administration, certainly. And even more direct rewards. One of its owners was a big contributor to George W Bush, to the extent that he was given ambassadorship to Germany.</p> <p>What will the unions get in return if Obama wins? Not very much, union officials said. They would like legislation giving unions nationwide rights but are not expecting that to happen. They would like tougher responses to China to ensure a more equal playing field in trade. But if all they get is to see Obama's healthcare reforms embedded, that would be a big bonus for workers and they will settle for that.</p> <p>After election night, the officials and volunteers will pack up their offices and have a few days off. Then they will be heading back for the midnight shift.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 29 October 2012 because the original referred to \"right-to-work\" laws that prohibit unions from requiring members to pay dues.

  "<p>Italian politics has been thrown into a state of renewed uncertainty after Silvio Berlusconi \u2013 enraged by his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/26/silvio-berlusconi-sentenced-four-years\" title=\"\">conviction for tax dodging</a> \u2013 warned that he was considering bringing down Mario Monti's government and pitching the country into a snap election.</p> <p>Earlier, he had announced that he would remain in politics \"to reform the world of justice\".</p> <p>Speaking at a press conference on Saturday, a visibly irate Berlusconi lashed out at a \"judge-ocracy\", which he said was running Italy. In a 55-minute monologue, he also turned his rage on Angela Merkel (who, together with the former French president Nicolas Sarkozy, he portrayed as the architect of his removal from office last year) and Monti, whom he depicted as her poodle.</p> <p>Slipping into the royal \"we\", the former prime minister declared: \"In the next few days, we shall decide with the senior members of my party whether to withdraw confidence from the government or, given the closeness of the end of the legislature, leave it to work out its mandate.\"</p> <p>His threat was delivered on the eve of a crucial regional vote in Sicily \u2013 the first big test of public opinion in the approach to the general election, which must be held by next spring.</p> <p>The former prime minister confirmed last week he would not be standing for re-election. But his family's newspaper, Il Giornale, reported on Sunday that \u2013 out of range of the microphones \u2013 Berlusconi had said the election could be held in January and, that being the case, there would be no time to choose his replacement.</p> <p>He used the press conference \u2013 packed with supporters who periodically broke into applause \u2013 to set out what looked very much like an electoral manifesto. His main points included the abolition of a limit on cash payments introduced by the Monti government to curb tax evasion, and the abolition of an unpopular property tax that was re-imposed as part of a drive to eliminate Italy's budget deficit.</p> <p>On paper, Berlusconi's party, the Freedom People (PdL), could strip Monti and his technocrats of their majority in the upper house of parliament. But it remains to be seen how many of the PdL's lawmakers would follow the party founder's orders.</p> <p>The PdL has been haemorrhaging support for months now, despite an earlier suggestion from Berlusconi that he would stand again. On Sicily, it faces a stiff challenge from a centre-left alliance and the Five Star Movement, led by the comedian and blogger Beppe Grillo.</p> <p>Il Giornale reported that the PdL's senior officials, who had not been told in advance of what Berlusconi planned to say, were \"in shock\". Some were furious, it said.</p>",

Dr. Jeff Masters at wunderground.com, as some have pointed out in the comments, says \"the destructive potential of the storm surge [is] exceptionally high,\" and he sees a 50% chance that the NYC subway could partially flood.</p> <p>On the bright side, the storm is expected to make a relatively quick approach, and so it will not push a surge through multiple tide cycles. <a href=\"http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/article.html?src=sandy\">Here's Masters:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Last night's 9:30 pm EDT&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/Storm_pages/sandy2012/wind.html\">H*Wind analysis</a>&#xa0;from NOAA's Hurricane Research Division put the destructive potential of Sandy's winds at a modest 2.6 on a scale of 0 to 6. However, the destructive potential of the storm surge was exceptionally high: 5.7 on a scale of 0 to 6. This is a higher destructive potential than any hurricane observed between 1969 - 2005, including Category 5 storms like Katrina, Rita, Wilma, Camille, and Andrew. The previous highest destructive potential for storm surge was 5.6 on a scale of 0 to 6, set during Hurricane Isabel of 2003. Sandy is now forecast to bring a near-record storm surge of 6 - 11 feet to Northern New Jersey and Long Island Sound, including the New York City Harbor. While Sandy's storm surge will be nowhere near as destructive as Katrina's, the storm surge does have the potential to cause many billions of dollars in damage if it hits near high tide at 9 pm EDT on Monday. The full moon is on Monday, which means astronomical high tide will be about 5% higher than the average high tide for the month. This will add another 2 - 3\" to water levels. Fortunately, Sandy is now predicted to make a fairly rapid approach to the coast, meaning that the peak storm surge will not affect the coast for multiple high tide cycles. Sandy's storm surge will be capable of overtopping the flood walls in Manhattan, which are only five feet above mean sea level. On August 28, 2011, Tropical Storm Irene brought a storm surge of 4.13' to Battery Park on the south side of Manhattan. The waters poured over the flood walls into Lower Manhattan, but came 8 - 12\" shy of being able to flood the New York City subway system. According to the latest storm surge forecast for NYC from NHC, Sandy's storm surge is expected to be several feet higher than Irene's. If the peak surge arrives near Monday evening's high tide at 9 pm EDT, a portion of New York City's subway system could flood, resulting in billions of dollars in damage.&#xa0;<strong>I give a 50% chance that Sandy's storm surge will end up flooding a portion of the New York City subway system.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>(h/t: @<a href=\"https://twitter.com/nytjim\">nytjim</a>)</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-508d4e69b5793e5495b451ae\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-28T15:25:29.260Z\">3.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A <strong>picture of the storm</strong>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/nytjim/status/262565573962121216\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>The enormity of Hurricane <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23Sandy\">#Sandy</a>. <a href=\"http://t.co/JNaBfgRl\" title=\"http://bit.ly/S5g7WO\">bit.ly/S5g7WO</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/GWbne8TJ\" title=\"http://twitter.com/nytjim/status/262565573962121216/photo/1\">twitter.com/nytjim/status/\u2026</a></p>&mdash; Jim Roberts (@nytjim) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nytjim/status/262565573962121216\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-28T14:44:46+00:00\">October 28, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-508d4d60b5793e5495b451ad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-28T15:21:04.724Z\">3.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The National Hurricane Center has <strong>issued its</strong> <a href=\"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT3+shtml/281457.shtml\">11am advisory</a>.
