[
  "<p>A year ago today, a few hundred people went to Wall Street, gathering in the financial district in Lower Manhattan with the intention of staying there until the US noticed. I was lucky to be in Zuccotti Park that first day, with the much more courageous and steadfast Occupiers, who slept out, and planned often truly profound visions for social change.</p> <p>I was just there as a citizen, a baffled ordinary person. I thought that what President Bush had done, what Obama had done, to deal with the financial crisis since 2007-2008 \u2013 the Dodd-Frank regulations, the Financial Inquiry Commission, civil actions and settlements \u2013 had ended as a wink-wink, nod-nod to global financial behemoths. I felt disbelief in seeing that, in the press at least, matters were closed. So I stood outside, and looked for what I could do. But like many others of the rank and file, the non-visionaries, I went home at night. I slept in a warm bed. I worried what America and the world would make of us.</p> <p>Then a kind of miracle occurred. Occupy camps sprang up in every major US city, plus little demonstrations and pickets in every tiny town. Polls showed widespread support, and the press and TV were unexpectedly interested and kind at first, considering how easy we were to make fun of.</p> <p>Once you talked to newcomers at marches and rallies, however, it seemed less surprising. Ordinary Americans were truly strangled by debt \u2013 suffering in immediate ways that rarely made the news \u2013 while we knew that bankrupt institutions had been propped up, with money from our taxes, only to go on foreclosing on soured mortgages and compounding our credit card service fees. Even the business reporters who visited Occupy knew the system was rickety and wildly unfair. The only people who didn't experience it personally, alas, were the wealthy, who controlled national political decisions.</p> <p>Here is a letter from a small town resident in Illinois to a Wall Street executive: \"Our neighbours, with teenagers our children grew up with, are about to be evicted from their house. Their car was repossessed. Their father works in construction, and there hasn't been much of that going on since the real-estate market crashed, which you may remember. Whose fault was that \u2013 his? \u2026 People in your world are doing great (from what we hear, 'great' doesn't begin to describe it), while the rest of us are going down. It is a disaster and cannot continue.\"</p> <p>Within six weeks of the start, many of us began to get nervous that the economic points were getting lost. The direct and obvious message in the protests was increasingly submerged beneath two distractions. One was the endless police violence against the protesters, and the other an obsession with how so many people could live so close together without showers and toilets.</p> <p>You could feel the change occurring: the press started to think the camps were gross. And you could tell that the police were distancing themselves from us, deciding that we were \"them\", not citizens. When, on 26 October 2011, Oakland <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/26/scott-olsen-occupy-oakland-review\" title=\"\">police shot a protester, Scott Olsen</a>, in the head with a tear-gas canister or some other unconventional round, I despaired. Olsen had survived two tours as a marine in Iraq, only to have his skull shattered for exercising freedom of assembly at home. That's it, I thought, that's how non-violent protest ends. You can always pre-empt protest in democracies with sufficient brutality, carefully and stealthily applied, under the guise of crowd control or health and sanitation.</p> <p>That night, in the endless click-trance that bad news induces on the internet, I was passing through sites from different cities' occupations when I landed on an effort called Occupy the Boardroom. This website asked for letters from people who could never go to an Occupy encampment. It collected detailed, forceful messages composed by ordinary citizens directly to named executives of the big six US banks. Its promise was to deliver them, by email, while posting them to \"the mailbag\" so we could all read one another's words.</p> <p>\"The housing crash of 2008 was not an unfortunate accident, rather the fallout from careless gambling and calculated, short-term greed ... I don't expect you to do anything about it. I'd rather you just got out of the way so the rest of the country can start rebuilding. Take your business to Greece or Ireland. Oh wait, you already bankrupted them. I guess the US was just the next target.\"</p> <p>\"Just wanted to give you a pat on the back for collecting over $4,000 from a friend of mine on a Chase credit card with a $500 limit (on which she charged a little bit less than $500 worth of merchandise). It was a great example of innovation in your industry!\"</p> <p>The authors might be struggling to make a living, working at two jobs to save their home, or taking care of an ill or elderly relative. But they supported the protests, and intelligently explained like no source I had ever seen what Americans have experienced at the hands of our banks, and the reasons to speak out.</p> <p>For the 10 months since the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2011/nov/15/occupy-wall-street-zuccotti-eviction-live\" title=\"\">eviction of Zuccotti Park</a>, these letters have given me direction through all the vicissitudes of Occupy. I met the website organisers and asked to use the only skills I have, as a writer and editor, to gather the best ones into a book. A group of volunteers and co-editors read all 8,000 letters. We selected 150. We contacted every author we could find for permission, and have published the letters as <a href=\"http://shop.nplusonemag.com/products/the-trouble-is-the-banks-letters-from-ordinary-americans-to-wall-street\" title=\"\">The Trouble is the Banks: Letters to Wall Street</a>. I'm hoping to mail the book to Mitt Romney \u2013 and the president too, of course.</p> <p>People ask me if Occupy will continue, or succeed in anything, if it will change anyone's mind in power. I really have no idea what to answer. For my part, these letters, bound in print, mean that no one can any longer say that they didn't learn what had gone wrong in America, what Occupy arose from, or whether the citizenry supported it; or that they didn't know what solutions citizens clearly wanted, or the profound reasons for our discontent.</p>",
  "<p>In today's Venezuela, to be a rightist is out of fashion. The streets of Caracas are lined with posters showing the face of the businessman and political leader <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/11/henrique-capriles-launches-venezuelan-presidency?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Henrique Capriles</a>, the opposition candidate for the presidency. In one picture he appears with a baseball cap featuring the colours of the country's flag and an open smile, as if to advertise some toothpaste. Above it, a legend says: \"Below and left.\"</p> <p>\"Below and left\" is one of the possible places in the ballot card where voters can mark their choice, but it is something else too: the political space that Capriles seeks to fill to surmount his disadvantage against Hugo Ch\u00e1vez.</p> <p>Throughout the campaign, Capriles \u2013 a rightist businessman \u2013 has presented himself as a progressive man, a politician who tries to recover Ch\u00e1vez's discourse from the opposite side of the street. Recently he has sought to reinforce this image by purporting to be a defender of the working class.</p> <p>Paradoxically, for the first time in a long while, the Venezuelan bourgeoisie has a candidate true to his class. He was born in the bosom of two families who own communications media. His adversaries accuse him of belonging to the ultra-rightist group <a href=\"http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradici%C3%B3n,_Familia_y_Propiedad\" title=\"\">Tradici\u00f3n, Familia y Propiedad</a> (Tradition, Family and Property). He took an active part in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/apr/21/usa.venezuela\" title=\"\">coup against Ch\u00e1vez in 2002</a>.</p> <p>This sort of political transvestism, with the right posing as a progressive force, is not gratuitous. As is shown in several opinion polls, Venezuela has given birth to a new political culture where the socialist ideal is widely accepted. Half the population agrees with the idea of building a socialist country, against 29% who oppose it. Citizens associate socialism with values such as democracy, equal opportunities, social inclusion, solidarity, co-operation, organisation, participation and, recently, efficiency.</p> <p>This massive adherence to the socialist cause is a relatively new development. During the 1960s and 1970s it was, according to pollster Germ\u00e1n Campos, a blocked idea, one that most citizens considered forbidden. But that changed radically in the 2005 presidential campaign, when President Ch\u00e1vez changed his stance from Bolivarianism, nationalism and anti-imperialism to portray himself as a socialist.</p> <p>This phenomenon can be explained as a result of the de-structuring of the old political culture and the formation of a new one, characterised by the emergence of a newly politicised population.</p> <p>The strength of this new political culture, and of the strides towards social inclusion made by the Bolivarian government, make things quite difficult for Capriles. He has no room to manoeuvre. He can't oppose this ideal in public without damaging his chances of victory. He can't express his political and economic proposals clearly, for he would be rejected. On the contrary, Ch\u00e1vez's view of his nation has become widely accepted, so much so that about two-thirds of the population see him as the future.</p> <p>The election on 7 October is not only a Venezuelan affair. Its importance goes beyond the country's boundaries. Its result matters to all of the continent, to the Non-Aligned Movement and to popular movements throughout the world.</p> <p>A Ch\u00e1vez victory will deepen a post-neoliberal, socialist model of development for the country. However, were the opposition to triumph, it would be a tough blow to those countries that seek to leave the Washington consensus behind or to create a new world order, beyond US hegemony.</p> <p>Since Ch\u00e1vez came to power Caracas has played an essential role in establishing better conditions for oil marketing and raising the oil price in international markets. It has succeeded in derailing free trade agreements in Latin America, helped to create regional trade blocks independent of the US, and transferred money and other resources to poor nations with progressive governments. It has forged alliances with Russia, Iran and China, and has gained a good reputation and influence among many non-aligned countries. All of this would be at risk if <em>Ch\u00e1vismo</em> were defeated at the polls.</p> <p>Venezuela has been fundamental in helping Cuba to deal with the US blockade. Programmes of economic and political co-operation between the two countries have provided Cuban health and education expertise in exchange for oil. Were Capriles to win the ballot, the shipment of oil to the island would be cancelled and thousands of Cuban doctors and teachers would be repatriated.</p> <p>Heads or tails? In next month's election, the stakes are high: either the radicalisation of the Bolivarian revolution and the deepening of the bet for a new world order, or the restoration of neoliberal capitalism. Its outcome will have consequences far beyond Venezuela.</p>",
  "<p>In one area the Lib Dems show the way. They are ruthless about getting rid of their leaders. The Tories never got over ousting Mrs T. Labour knifed Tony Blair but not until he'd gone past his sell-by date. Then they fretted over the hapless Gordon Brown, with nobody prepared to play Brutus.</p> <p>But the supposedly cuddly party of the centre enjoys its coups. Charlie Kennedy was done for; then Ming Campbell was quickly shown the door. With his party floundering in the polls and with his personal ratings dire, will Nick Clegg suffer a similar fate?</p> <p>The dwindling band of Lib Dem members will gather for their conference in Brighton next weekend in a twitchy frame of mind. Opposition life was easy. They would fight on certain issues \u2013 civil liberties, the environment, Iraq \u2013 exploiting the hearings they were granted by a media traditionally disdainful of the third party.</p> <p>But, if the polls are to be believed, they have achieved precious little in government: no recognition of the \"pupil premium\" for schools or of work on climate change. The <a href=\"http:/ /www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/13/lib-dems-no-difference-political-reform? newsfeed=\" true\"\" title=\"\">only policy that appears to have registered with the public</a> has been taking low earners out of paying tax.</p> <p>There are two reasons for this: one is in Clegg's hands, the other is not. The first is the nature of compromise in a coalition. Much of the party's work in government \u2013 mainly through the quartet (David Cameron, George Osborne, Clegg, Danny Alexander) that runs the show \u2013 is based around negative compromise. It is about trimming the worst excesses of the Tories, with Cameron agreeing to go slow or drop a certain clause from a bill, as long as he gets the rest through. This is important, but thankless work, but making the Tories less nasty is not a compelling slogan for the 2015 election. It has been far harder for the Lib Dems to achieve positive compromise, in which they are able to push something through which bears their imprint.</p> <p>Clegg's problem is this: how can you do business with another team, while making clear that you do not share most&#xa0;of their values or aspirations? This&#xa0;lies at the heart of coalition politics,&#xa0;which continental Europeans have had far more experience of dealing with.&#xa0;What has been found to work is when, publicly but politely, one leader says: \"We advocated A, they advocated B, but we agreed to settle on C.\" All surveys in Europe suggest that the public respects an open airing and settling of differences. Yet the Lib Dem leader consistently dismisses this notion. Instead he has fluctuated from the mistaken love-in on the lawn and the kamikaze mission over tuition fees, to visceral anger over Cameron's undermining of the AV campaign and House of Lords reform.</p> <p>This month's reshuffle presents Clegg with an unlikely opportunity. He can now have no doubt about Cameron's intentions. The Conservative rump of the cabinet is as red meat as it could be \u2013 authoritarian and sceptical about climate change. Some of Clegg's team were taken aback by the changes. They shouldn't have been.</p> <p>With the coalition entering the second half of its projected five-year lifespan, the Lib Dem leader needs each and every day to tell the public what his party is seeking to do, what it will put up with, and what it won't. This can be done without petulance \u2013 at least on the Lib Dem side. If Tory backbenchers, in denial over their failure to win in 2010, wish to force an early election or go into minority administration, let them.</p> <p>There was nothing ignoble about entering into coalition with the Conservatives, just as it would be entirely desirable for a similar alliance with Labour \u2013 still the preferred option for most Lib Dems. But that will have to wait. Until 2015 the Lib Dems should keep lines of communication open with both sides. Ming Campbell is an important elder statesman for the party and sees virtues in co-operation with other parties \u2013 but not absorption. As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/14/vince-cable-criticised-text-messages?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">he pointed out to Vince Cable</a>, there is nothing to be gained by ingratiation.</p> <p>Much of the attention in Brighton will revolve around Cable's supposed manoeuvres. He has outright support from a small circle; and Tim Farron, the party president, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9545261/Lib-Dem-president-Labour-Why-not-Labour-We-can-work-with-either-party.html\" title=\"\">used a newspaper interview</a> to suggest that he, too, was in the market. But so far there is no sign among senior figures of a rebellion against Clegg (Tory conspirators and Boris groupies are hovering far more darkly over Cameron). For all the Lib Dems' unpopularity in the polls there have been remarkably few signs of indiscipline within the party.</p> <p>But the baubles of office should not dull the senses. With such things as a wealth tax and moves towards social mobility, Clegg has adopted a Blairite tendency of picking up an idea, giving it an outing, but then failing to pursue it. He needs to be able to show by 2015 that he has delivered a distinctive record of achievements, alongside the beginnings of an economic recovery. The new big idea for conference is affordable housing. That needs to be driven through, as part of a coherent set of policies to give substance to the economic re-balancing Clegg has spoken of in the past.</p> <p>This year's conference, and the ensuing 12 months, will define Clegg's leadership and longevity. He has kept the coalition going, through gritted teeth, unwittingly allowing himself to be portrayed as sympathetic to the Conservatives. Cameron has declared his hand. Clegg must, publicly and robustly, do so too. That is what coalition politics \u2013 and political survival \u2013 are all about.</p>",
  "<p>Finally, the lineup for the US presidential election in November has been decided: the Republicans have nominated John Kerry and his running mate Chris Van Hollen, who will go head-to-head against the White House incumbent Rob Portman and his vice-president Ted Olson.</p> <p>The four men are indeed the 2012 presidential candidates, though they are taking on the roles more as actors than as politicians. They have been chosen by the actual candidates \u2013 Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, Barack Obama and Joe Biden \u2013 to play their rivals in mock debate sessions ahead of next month's TV debates.</p> <p>Over the weekend we learned the identity of the final member of the four. Ted Olson, who held the post of solicitor general under George Bush, will wear the shoes of Joe Biden in preparatory sessions with the real Republican vice-presidential nominee, Paul Ryan.</p> <p>He joins Rob Portman, who plays Obama as Romney's sparring partner; Kerry who conversely plays Romney in mock debating sessions with Obama; and Van Hollen who has been given the role of Ryan as Biden prepares for the debates.</p> <p>Since the first dramatic TV debate in September 1960, in which Richard Nixon put forward a disastrously sweaty performance against John F Kennedy, the importance of preparing for the events has grown into an entire industry.</p> <p>The role of sparring partner has grown in importance by equal measure, and the role is now taken very seriously indeed \u2013 even more so this year in a tightly fought race when so much is potentially riding on the debates.</p> <p>A good debating partner will help the real candidates hone their messages and avoid nasty surprises. Portman, who is recognised as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/27/rob-portman-obama-romney-debate\">a leading exponent of the art</a>, spends hours preparing himself for the role, watching videos of the politicians he is playing over and over until he knows their every policy position as intimately as their mannerisms.</p> <p>Such is the exacting nature of the work \u2013 which involves a capacity to memorise enormous amounts of policy detail combined with skills as a debater and performer \u2013 it is no surprise that three of the four are legally trained.</p> <p>Olson has presented 58 cases before the US supreme court including the highly controversial Bush v Gore in 2000 which handed the election to Bush even though he lost the popular vote.</p> <p>Portman practiced in commercial law, and Kerry was a prosecutor in Massachusetts. Van Hollen is the odd one out: though he has no legal experience, his value to Biden is that he is knows Paul Ryan's foibles inside out.</p> <p>A Democratic representative for a district of Maryland in the US Congress, Van Hollen has has the chance to study Ryan at close quarters for years. They both sit on the House budget committee that Ryan chairs.</p> <p>The exposure will help him master the finer details of Ryan's political beliefs, which in turn could assist Biden identify weaknesses in his position that he will attempt to probe during the single vice-presidential debate on 11 October in Danville Kentucky.</p> <p>Van Hollen has indicated that he is also trying to get on top of Ryan's peculiarly emotive facial and body expressions that he displays in debate, all the better to portray him during the dummy sessions.</p> <p>\"I got my lines,\" Van Hollen said recently when asked how he was getting on with the role of Ryan. \"I've got to work on my gestures.\"</p> <p>The presidential candidates have three TV debates, in Denver Colorado on 3 October; Hempstead New York on 16 October; and Boca Raton Florida on 22 October. Given the intense pressure on all the candidates \u2013 real and dramatic alike \u2013 it is no surprise that the dummy debates can get quite heated.</p> <p>\"You kinda swing back and forth,\" Portman told CNN. \"I mean, nothing physical, although it's come close at times.\"</p>",
  "<p>Greece, the country long at the epicentre of Europe's economic crisis, has \"turned a corner\", its finance minister Yannis Stournaras said on Sunday after international lenders gave their strongest signal yet that the debt-stricken nation would be given more time to meet repayment targets.</p> <p>Following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/14/eurozone-crisis-qe3-markets-euro-ministers\" title=\"\">an informal summit of eurozone finance ministers in Cyprus</a>, Stournaras insisted he was \"more optimistic\" about Greece's prospects, even though it remains in a race against time to meet the onerous conditions that would unlock the rescue loans to keep bankruptcy at bay.</p> <p>\"I am more optimistic ... we have turned the corner. There is more trust between us and our partners but we still have a long way to go,\" Stournaras told the Guardian. \"We have to have cleared up everything in the next two weeks so that everything can be put on the table at the [next] euro group meeting on 8 October. If we can't clear everything there can be no agreement,\" he said referring to the \u20ac31.5bn (\u00a325.5m) aid instalment Athens has been attempting to win since July.</p> <p>Asked if relations had improved between Greece and Germany \u2013 ties that have been unusually stormy since the outbreak of the crisis in late 2009 \u2013 the Oxford-trained economist was unequivocal.</p> <p>\"There is a better chemistry in relations between Greece and Germany. That is what I feel, but they [the Germans] have to be asked as well.\"</p> <p>Stournaras made the comments as eurozone fiscal diehards appeared to cut the country some slack, saying they would yield to Athens' demand for more time to apply a gruelling fiscal adjustment programme.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://money.oe24.at/So-wird-der-Euro-gerettet/78733781\" title=\"\">an interview published in Sunday's edition of the Oesterreich paper</a>, the Austrian finance minister, Maria Fekter, said Greece would be given more time to meet deficit reduction targets although she made clear the payment extension would not mean more money being injected into the \u20ac240bn EU-IMF-sponsored bailout already agreed with Athens.</p> <p>\"We are still awaiting the troika report,\" Fekter said of the assessment of Greece's fiscal progress that debt auditors are expected to deliver in October. \"And Greece still has to get some things on track but we will achieve a cost-neutral extension.\"</p> <p>However, <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/09/16/uk-europe-greece-austria-idUKBRE88F02B20120916\" title=\"\">in a separate interview with Dutch newspaper Der Standard</a>, Fekter suggested Greece might only receive \"a few more weeks time\".</p> <p>The Troika report \u2013 a quarterly review of the headway the country has made in meeting the terms of its international rescue package \u2013 is crucial to releasing funds to recapitalise Greek banks and the cash-starved Greek economy.</p> <p>Conservative prime minister Antonis Samaras has repeatedly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/24/samaras-merkel-friendly-diplomacy\" title=\"\">appealed for a two-year extension of the deficit-reducing programme</a>, arguing that this would not only give Greece more time to narrow its spending gap but also the leeway to enforce long overdue structural reforms deemed vital to improving the country's competitiveness.</p> <p>Austria, one of the loudest critics of Greek foot-dragging, had previously said the nation risked exiting the eurozone as a result of its failure to meet commitments.</p> <p>Fekter's change of heart reflects the shift in attitude in Europe at large, with the continent's policy makers now calculating that a confrontation with Athens would likely backfire as Samaras' fragile coalition attempts to muster the necessary support for a new round of budget cuts worth nearly \u20ac12bn.</p> <p>After years of putting austerity policies first \u2013 measures that in Greece's case have seen the economy contract by nearly 20% over the last three years amid soaring unemployment and poverty rates \u2013 EU governments are tilting increasingly towards favouring growth over belt-tightening, a shift inaugurated with the June election of socialist president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande in France.</p> <p>Their latest concession comes despite Stournaras's inability to present counterparts with a breakdown of the cuts \u2013 demanded in return for aid by creditors \u2013 following infighting in the three-party alliance over the measures.</p> <p>But hardening his anti-bailout stance, Greece's main opposition leader, Alexis Tsipras, said the government was \"dangerously deluded\" if it believed the extension would offer relief to the country. The head of the radical left Syriza party vowed on Sunday to step up opposition to cuts, which he said would once again fall on society's most vulnerable. Calling for the international rescue package to be immediately annulled Tsipras said: \"The slippery road towards catastrophe must be stopped now.\"</p> <p>\"Our first concern is that society puts up a fight so that measures worth \u20ac11.6bn are neither passed nor implemented,\" he told reporters in Thessaloniki, where Greece's annual international trade fair is taking place.</p> <p>Tsipras argued that the three-month coalition should step down for failing to live up to pre-election pledges to abolish the loss of further benefits, pay and pension cuts \u2013 instead insisting on an \"absurd fiscal policy\" that relied on foreign aid injections to keep the economy afloat.</p> <p>\"From being a guinea pig where the most extreme model of neo-liberalism is imposed, Greece can become a leader in progressive solutions on a pan-European level,\" said the leftist, without explaining what those solutions could be.</p>",
  "<p>Iran has confirmed for the first time that forces from its revolutionary guards corps (IRGC) are in Syria helping Bashar al-Assad's government crush rebels, and warned that it would get involved militarily if its Arab ally came under attack.</p> <p>In a clear public signal of Tehran's continuing support for Assad, the commander of the Islamic republic's elite military formation said that a number of members of the IRGC's Qods force were in Syria, though General Mohammad Ali Jafari gave no further details and claimed this did not constitute \"a military presence\".</p> <p>It was a surprisingly candid response to persistent claims by western countries, the Syrian opposition and Israel that Iran is actively helping the regime in the 18th month of a bloody war. Lakhdar Brahimi, the veteran Algerian diplomat who replaced Kofi Annan as UN envoy to Syria earlier this month, met Assad in Damascus on Saturday but warned afterwards that any progress would be slow and halting given the yawning gap between government and opposition. \"The crisis is dangerous and getting worse, and it is a threat to the Syrian people, the region and the world,\" said Brahimi.</p> <p>Reports from Syriaon Sunday described government forces fighting rebels amid shelling and sniper fire in Damascus and Aleppo, as well as in Homs and Deir ez-Zor. The Local Coordination Committees, an activist network, reported 103 dead. Opposition activists reported 115 people killed on Saturday. According to the UN around 20,000 people have been killed. Opposition sources say the figure is closer to 30,000.</p> <p>Jafari's admission underlines the way in which the Syrian uprising has become enmeshed in regional and international rivalries. Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey are arming Syrian rebel groups, while the US, Britain and France have called for Assad to go but are offering only limited and non-lethal backing to the armed opposition. Russia and China have repeatedly blocked action against Syria at the UN.</p> <p>The Qods force includes elements of special forces, intelligence gathering and aid, and answers to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. It has been accused of planning attacks inside Iraq since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. Jafari said that the IRGC was providing \"intellectual and advisory help\" to Syria.</p> <p>British officials say that the IRGC has provided riot control equipment and technical advice on how to crush dissent, for example on how to flood areas with security forces. Iran is also providing support to improve the Syrian regime's intelligence gathering capabilities and help to monitor protesters' use of the internet and mobile phone network, including text messaging.</p> <p>Iran is said to have been dismayed at the heavy-handed way its long-standing Arab ally responded when the unrest began in March 2011, contrasting it with the more sophisticated response to protests that followed its own disputed presidential election in 2009.</p> <p>\"If Syria came under military attack, Iran would also give military support but it \u2026 totally depends on the circumstances,\" AFP reported Jafari as saying at a rare press conference in Tehran.</p> <p>The general also said that the Strait of Hormuz, the channel at the mouth of the Gulf through which a third of the world's traded oil passes, would be a legitimate target for Iran should it be attacked. \"If war occurs in the region and the Islamic republic is involved, it is natural that the Strait of Hormuz as well as the energy [market] will face difficulties. The US has many vulnerabilities around Iran, and its bases are within the range of the guards' missiles. We have other capabilities as well, particularly when it comes to the support of Muslims for the Islamic republic,\" he said.</p> <p>In Damascus, Brahimi also met Syrian opposition figureswho are still tolerated by the regime. \"We told Mr Brahimi \u2026 of our support for his efforts to resolve the crisis by ending the violence and killings, providing medical care and releasing political prisoners,\" said Hassan Abdel Azim, spokesman for the National Coordination Committee for Democratic Change. But the head of the Free Syrian Army's military council in Aleppo, Colonel Abdel Jabar al-Oqaidi, predicted that the envoy's mission would fail, like Annan's, because he had nothing to offer those fighting for their freedom, al-Arabiya TV reported.</p> <p>Syria's state news agency Sana quoted Assad as telling Brahimi that the success of his mission hinged on \"pressuring countries which finance and train the terrorists, and which traffic weapons to Syria, to stop these actions.\"</p> <p>In Istanbul, Tariq al-Hashimi, the fugitive Iraqi vice-president, said in interview that the government of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki was failing to stop ammunitions and armaments reaching Syrian government forces. \"My country is unfortunately becoming an Iranian corridor to support the autocratic regime of Bashar al-Assad,\" he said. \"There is no doubt about that.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has renewed his demand that the US set out clear \"red lines\" for Iran over its nuclear programme, in remarks likely to put further strain on his relationship with Barack Obama in the runup to the presidential election.</p> <p>In interviews on American television networks to mark the Jewish new year, Netanyahu repeated his call for the US to clarify the point at which it would take military action rather than allow the Iranian nuclear programme to advance.</p> <p>\"You have to place that red line before them now, before it's too late,\" Netanyahu told NBC's Meet the Press programme on Sunday. Iran would be on the brink of nuclear weapons capability by next spring, he warned.</p> <p>He also sought to link Iran's nuclear programme to the murder last week of the US ambassador to Libya. \"Iran is guided by a leadership with an unbelievable fanaticism,\" he said. \"It's the same fanaticism that you see storming your embassies today. You want these fanatics to have nuclear weapons?\"</p> <p>Both the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, and the defence secretary, Leon Panetta, have dismissed Netanyahu's demand for clear red lines. In an <a href=\"http://e-ring.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/09/14/exclusive_panetta_says_pentagon_prepositioning_forces_for_additional_unrest\" title=\"\">interview with Foreign Policy magazine</a>, Panetta accused Netanyahu of trying to force the US into a corner over its Iran policy. \"The fact is \u2026 presidents of the United States, prime ministers of Israel or any other country \u2026 don't have, you know, a bunch of little red lines that determine their decisions,\" he said.</p> <p>\"What they have are facts that are presented to them about what a country is up to, and then they weigh what kind of action is needed in order to deal with that situation. I mean, that's the real world. Red lines are kind of political arguments that are used to try to put people in a corner.\"</p> <p>Clinton bluntly told Bloomberg Radio last week: \"We're not setting deadlines.\"</p> <p>The row deepened when Israeli officials claimed that Obama had declined to meet Netanyahu when he visits the US towards the end of this month, characterising the move as a deliberate snub. White House officials played down the matter.</p> <p>But there are suspicions in Washington that Netanyahu is trying to use the US election as leverage to bounce Obama into taking a more hawkish line on Iran. Netanyahu has failed to conceal his preference for Obama's rival, Mitt Romney, to enter the White House. Romney has hinted that he would push for military action against Iran's nuclear programme and has accused Obama of \"throwing Israel under a bus\". His chief bankroller, Sheldon Adelson, is also a staunch supporter of the Israeli prime minister.</p> <p>In an interview with the Jerusalem Post, Netanyahu denied he was interfering in the US election. The accusation was \"completely groundless\", he said.</p> <p>Some Israeli commentators have expressed alarm about the deterioration in an already frosty relationship between the two leaders.</p> <p>\"To [Obama] and his aides, the tongue-lashing he and Hillary Clinton took from Netanyahu, their depiction as ostensibly preferring Iran above Israel, the co-operation of [Netanyahu] and his aides with Republican congressmen working against the White House, and the leak to the media by the prime minister's bureau that Obama refused to meet with Netanyahu \u2013 all this looks like crude, vulgar and unrestrained intervention in the US election campaign,\" wrote <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/in-israel-we-speak-republican.premium-1.464972\" title=\"\">Yossi Verter in Haaretz</a>. http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/in-israel-we-speak-republican.premium-1.464972</p>",
  "<p>The president of Libya's parliament, Mohamed al-Magariaf, has said military action is being considered against militants blamed for the killing of the US ambassador Chris Stevens.</p> <p>Magariaf also confirmed reports from Washington that US officials intercepted communications discussing the planned attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, which he said linked al-Qaida in the Maghreb to an Islamist brigade, Ansar al-Sharia. \"Yes, that happened,\" he said.</p> <p>Magariaf said the intercepts matched other evidence indicating members of the brigade took part in Tuesday's all-night assault on the compound and an accommodation site. \"It seems there is a division within Ansar al-Sharia about this attack, some for participation, some against,\" he said. \"We are in the process of investigation.\"</p> <p>Such transmissions would be powerful evidence linking al-Sharia to the attack, and Magariaf said Libya had been passed the information by the US government. He confirmed that the intercepted communications discussed the timing of last week's assault. But he urged the US not to act unilaterally, fearing it would antagonise public opinion. \"We will not hesitate to act, to do what is our duty,\" Magariaf said. \"Let us start first by ourselves and if we are not capable, then whoever can help us. My experience with the Americans, they know what they have to do.\"</p> <p>His comments came as Libya's interior ministry said weekend raids had led to the arrest of 50 suspects, but gave no details and did not say whether they were Islamist militants.</p> <p>Tension is building in Benghazi amid speculation that military action is imminent against the al-Sharia brigade, whose commanders deny responsibility for the consulate attack.</p> <p>Magariaf claimed the attack had been premeditated. \"It was planned, definitely. It was planned by foreigners, by people who entered the country a few months ago,\" he said. \"And they were planning this criminal act since their arrival.\"</p> <p>However, the US ambassador to the UN, Susan Rice, said on Sunday that the consulate attack was a spontaneous reaction to an anti-Muslim film, and not a planned or co-ordinated strike. She said it appeared to be a copycat demonstration inspired by those that had erupted hours earlier outside the US embassy in Cairo.</p> <p>\"It seems to have been hijacked, let us say, by some individual clusters of extremists who came with heavier weapons,\" Rice said, adding that whether those extremists had ties to al-Qaida or other terrorist groups has yet to be determined.</p> <p>Two US warships equipped with Tomahawk cruise missiles are stationed off the coast and a propeller-driven aircraft with no lights, thought to be a drone, has spent hours in the skies above the city for the past two nights.</p> <p>The Pentagon has dispatched elite marine rapid response teams to Libya and Yemen, but a team deployed to Khartoum on Friday was turned back when the Sudanese government objected.</p> <p>The US defence secretary, Leon Panetta, said on Sunday the Pentagon had \"deployed our forces to a number of areas in the region to be prepared to respond to any requests that we receive to be able to protect our personnel and our American property\".</p> <p>The al-Sharia brigade remains in its base in Benghazi, and its soldiers are guarding a hospital where medical officials say two wounded militants are being treated. Al-Sharia guards there refused to allow access or comment on the attack.</p> <p>Magariaf said the attack on the US mission, the fifth on diplomatic targets in Benghazi since April, was part of a wider campaign by militants to destabilise Libya, taking advantage of the disorder of a country still without cohesive government.</p> <p>\"This is a turning point for the country. The confrontation is necessary and inevitable with these elements,\" he said. \"[It is] either them or Libya being safe and united. Today it is the Americans, tomorrow it is going to be Libyans.\"</p> <p>Magariaf rose to prominence in the 1980s when, having fled to Britain, he led the anti-Gaddafi National Front for the Salvation of Libya. He won a seat in the new parliament in July in an election in which tribal and liberal parties prevailed against the Muslim Brotherhood.</p> <p>He said he had evidence \"foreign countries\" were involved in supporting the attack on the consulate but declined to name them. \"It's a deliberate, calculated action by a group working in collaboration with non-Libyan extremists. I would not be surprised if it's another country, but it's not Saudi Arabia or Qatar, I'm sure.\"</p> <p>In Benghazi, evidence linking members of the al-Sharia brigade to the attack is growing. The chief of the city's supreme security council said witnesses and mobile phone footage showed members were involved.</p> <p>This was confirmed by an eyewitness who was among bystanders who turned up to see what began as an anti-US protest on Tuesday night.</p> <p>The witness, who said he was too frightened to give his name, said he had watched as about a dozen armed men with a black al-Sharia brigade banner attacked the rear gate of the consulate with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades.</p> <p>\"The guys were with beards and Kalashnikovs, they were standing there with the Ansar al-Sharia flag. One hundred per cent this was planned, they attacked from both sides [of the consulate] at once,\" he said.</p> <p>A Libyan intelligence official told the Guardian at the weekend that a group of between 12 and 14 militants were suspected of orchestrating the attack.</p> <p>Magariaf said he had held weekend meetings with both the army chief of staff, Yusef Mangoush, and what he called \"loyal\" brigades from the Libya Shield, in effect a parallel army of former rebel formations who distrust the present government, which the new parliament has yet to replace.</p> <p>He also said he had the support of the new prime minister, Mustafa Abushagur, although a new cabinet has yet to be appointed and it is unclear whether the present administration, led by Abdurrahim al-Keib, which remains in power, has approved military action.</p> <p>There are fears that while the Sharia brigade, which has an estimated 100 members, can be subdued, other jihadist groups in Libya, notably those which bulldozed Sufi Islamic shrines in Tripoli last month, may react if military action is taken in Benghazi.</p> <h2>Reactions to the anti-Islam video from around the world</h2> <p>\u2022 In Pakistan hundreds of protesters clashed with police as they tried to march toward the US consulate in Karachi.
