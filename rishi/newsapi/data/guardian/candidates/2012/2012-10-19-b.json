He told folks he was \"the ideal candidate\" for the Tea Party. Now suddenly he's saying, \"what, who, me?\" He's forgetting what his own positions are, and he's betting that you will, too.</p> <p>I mean, he's changing up so much and backtracking and sidestepping, we've got to name this condition that he's going through. I think it's called <strong>Romnesia</strong>. That's what it's called. I think that's what he's going through.</p> <p>Now, I'm not a medical doctor, but I do want to go over some of the symptoms with you because I want to make sure nobody else catches it.</p> <p>If you say you're for equal pay for equal work, but you keep refusing to say whether or not you'd sign a bill that protects equal pay for equal work \u2013 you might have Romnesia.</p> <p>If you say women should have access to contraceptive care, but you support legislation that would let your employer deny you contraceptive care \u2013 you might have a case of Romnesia.</p> <p>If you say you'll protect a woman's right to choose, but you stand up at a primary debate and said that you'd be delighted to sign a law outlawing that right to choose in all cases, man, you've definitely got Romnesia.</p> <p>Now, this extends to other issues. If you say earlier in the year, I'm going to give a tax cut to the top 1% and then in a debate you say, I don't know anything about giving tax cuts to rich folks \u2013 you need to get a thermometer, take your temperature, because you've probably got Romnesia.</p> <p>If you say that you're a champion of the coal industry when, while you were governor you stood in front of a coal plant and said, this plant will kill you, that's some Romnesia.</p> <p>So I think you're beginning to be able to identify these symptoms.</p> <p>And if you come down with a case of Romnesia, and you can't seem to remember the policies that are still on your website, or the promises you've made over the six years you've been running for president, here's the good news: Obamacare covers pre-existing conditions. We can fix you up. We've got a cure. We can make you well, Virginia.

  "<p>The Obama campaign is running on women's issues for a third day in a row, but this has been its most successful day yet. Attempting to encapsulate what it claims to be Mitt Romney's shifting positions on a number of issues, the president's team has hit on a catchy phrase: \"Romnesia\".</p> <p>Obama unveiled the new noun during a speech to students at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, claiming that Romney had forgotten earlier positions in which he had opposed equal pay for women and easily-available contraception and had supported outlawing abortion.</p> <p>The potency of the phrase was evident in the response of the audience, which laughed and cheered on first hearing on it and as Obama riffed on it in the remainder of his speech.</p> <p>It quickly became clear \"Romnesia\" was not just a throwaway line, as the Obama campaign followed up within minutes. Obama's campaign manager, Jim Messina, tweeted that Obama \"diagnoses Romney's failure to recall his extreme stances on women's issues\".</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8BBEXB1Wf9c?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8BBEXB1Wf9c\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The phrase instantly stuck on the social networks too.

That phrase made Romney sound out of touch with contemporary society and the changes that have been taking place in the workplace and in attitudes towards women's rights.</p> <p>In Virginia, Obama pressed home the message. Romney said he was for equal pay but refused to sign a bill that protects equal pay for equal work. Romney had said he was in favour of access to contraception but supported legislation that would allow employers to deny it. Romney had said he would protect women's right to abortion but had said earlier this year he would sign a law outlawing the right to choose in all cases.</p> <p>Romney is paying the price for having to move to the right during the Republican primaries and caucuses earlier this year, in order to win over over conservatives for whom abortion remains a top issue. Up against opponents such as Rick Santorum, who has an unyielding position on abortion, Romney was in trouble, having adopted a liberal position on the issue while fighting to become governor of liberal-leaning Massachusetts. In the primaries and caucuses, Romney shifted to the right, saying in one debate that he would be delighted to support legislation outlawing all abortion.</p> <p>The Obama campaign is running hard on the issue because women could hold the key to the election. Democratic candidates normally hold a lead over their Republican rivals among women and Obama has long enjoyed a lead of eight to nine points over Romney among likely women voters, compensating for Romney's lead among white males. But some polls have shown that lead eroding and the Democrats need those wavering women voters back.</p>",
  "<p>We know the government hopes to do nothing, but what about the rest of us? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2012/oct/19/gaddafi-death-anniversary-libya-better-or-worse-comment\" title=\"\">Exactly one year after the death of Muammar Gaddafi</a>, the chances of another round of Libya-style western military intervention, this time for Syria, hover close to zero. Even the hawkish Mitt Romney promises no such thing. Few politicians speak even of non-military options \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.outsiders-guide.org/\" title=\"\">of which there are many</a> \u2013 let alone taking up arms.</p> <p>They say nothing because there is no pressure on them to say anything. Here and abroad, there is virtual silence, save for the desperate pleas of a few Syrian expats and yesterday's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/19/turkey-britain-us-intervene-syria\" title=\"\">cry for humanitarian help</a> from the Turkish foreign minister. We know the facts, and we know what Bashar al-Assad has done since demonstrators took to the streets to protest against his rule 19 months ago. He and his forces have pursued a campaign of the most chilling brutality, using fighter planes to bomb civilian neighbourhoods, capturing, starving and torturing children as young as six, <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2012/09/25/syria-save-the-children-report.html\" title=\"\">according to Save the Children</a>, and racking up <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2012/10/19/world/meast/syria-civil-war/index.html\" title=\"\">an estimated death toll of 30,000 victims</a>.</p> <p>People know all this but stay mute. Not that they should be demanding immediate military action. After Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya, people are justifiably both weary and wary, with many regarding action in Syria as a practical impossibility. I understand that. But what I can't comprehend is the lack of public pressure on those doing the actual killing \u2013 starting with the Assad regime. Instead, public opinion seems utterly disengaged, unbothered by the slaughter under way in Aleppo, Homs and Damascus.</p> <p>There are no mass demonstrations outside the Syrian embassy in London. The story is rarely on the front page or on the TV bulletins. Even when there is a shocking atrocity, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/28/syria-worst-massacre-daraya-death-toll-400\" title=\"\">such as the Daraya massacre of up to 400 people in August</a>, it makes only a fleeting impact. There is no Disaster Emergency Committee appeal. At the Labour party conference, there were fringe meetings on every possible subject, from teenage spending habits to domestic pets. But there was not a single session focused solely on Syria \u2013 and this in the party that calls itself internationalist.</p> <p>It's not as if this is par for the course, that we never get exercised by the loss of innocent life in the Middle East. We do. Nearly four years ago Israel launched Operation Cast Lead, designed to halt Hamas rocket fire from Gaza. It resulted in some 1,400 Palestinian deaths. For nearly a month that story was never off the front page, and it often led the TV news, here and around the world. There were large and loud public demonstrations. The DEC set up a fund and sought to air a televised appeal, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/jan/23/bbc-refuses-gaza-appeal\" title=\"\">famously refused by the BBC</a>.</p> <p>There is no such clamour now. <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7822222.stm\" title=\"\">The Stop the War Coalition is not summoning thousands</a> to central London to demand an end to the fighting, as it did then. On the contrary, <a href=\"http://www.stopwar.org.uk/index.php/resources/stop-the-war-coalition-statements/890-no-foreign-intervention-in-syria\" title=\"\">its statements</a> are content simply to oppose western intervention \u2013 of which there is next to no prospect \u2013 while politely refusing to condemn Assad's war on his own people. Caryl Churchill has not written a new play, Seven Syrian Children, exploring the curious mindset of the Alawite people that makes them capable of such horrors, the way she rushed to the stage <a href=\"http://www.royalcourttheatre.com/whats-on/seven-jewish-children-a-play-for-gaza\" title=\"\">to probe the Jewish psyche in 2009</a>. The slaughter in Syria has similarly failed to move <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/feb/18/poetry.features1\" title=\"\">the poet Tom Paulin</a> to pick up his pen. Apparently, these Syrian deaths are not worthy of artistic note. The contrast has struck Robert Fisk, no defender of Israel. <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/fisk/robert-fisk-syrian-war-of-lies-and-hypocrisy-7985012.html\" title=\"\">He puts it baldly</a>: \"[T]he message that goes out is simple: we demand justice and the right to life for Arabs if they are butchered by the west and its Israeli allies, but not when they are being butchered by their fellow Arabs.\"</p> <p>Plenty resist that explanation. Some say the lethargy of both the public and anti-war left is due to the fact that Syria is now locked in a civil conflict, making it hard to tell good guys from bad guys. Yet NGOs were swamped with cash donations during the Kosovo crisis: the public did not write that off as a mere internal Balkan problem. Besides, though it's a civil war now, with both sides armed, for several months it was much more straightforward: peaceful demonstrators killed in cold blood. Yet few rallied to the Syrian people's cause then either.</p> <p>Others wonder if Gaza in 2008-9 stirred greater outrage because it was such an intense episode, unfolding in a matter of weeks, while Syria has been a drip-drip horror story played out over nearly two years. But this hardly stacks up. Awful to speak in such terms, but the killing rate has been more, not less, intense in Syria: witness that massacre of 400 in a single day.</p> <p>Anxious for answers, I called Lindsey German of Stop the War, who told me the organisation was not active on Syria because that \"isn't Stop the War's job\". Its focus is on what \"Britain and the US are doing\". Why, then, was it so vocal on Gaza? Because the west \"was very much in support of the Israelis, so it was very different\". (In fact, Britain did not support Operation Cast Lead but called for a ceasefire.) She adds that the Palestinian question \"has its own dynamic, which isn't true of any other country\".</p> <p>The trouble is, such thinking surely leads to a very parochial form of internationalism \u2013 turning a blind eye to all those areas of the globe where one's own government is not involved. And that's if such a rule were applied consistently \u2013 which it is not.</p> <p>The last argument is a variation on the civil war one: Syria is now mired in a viciously sectarian conflict, Alawites and their allies against Sunnis and the rest, which makes it impossible for outsiders to take sides. But such logic rapidly falls into the moral hole identified by Fisk, in which a Muslim death matters less when the killer is a fellow Muslim.</p> <p>Of course we reserve a special kind of outrage for the targeting of one ethnic group by another. Yet there is a risk here. It's not simply a bias against Jews that regards an Arab or Muslim death as only deserving condemnation when Israel is responsible. It is demeaning of Arabs and Muslims themselves \u2013 implying that when members of those groups kill each other it somehow carries little moral weight. Such a view is not defensible, especially among those who would consider themselves to be enlightened or progressive. Every life has equal worth, no matter who's doing the dying \u2013 or who's doing the killing.</p> <p>\u2022 Comments on this article will be launched on Saturday morning</p>",

Obama had an <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/04/16/cnn-poll-gender-gap-and-likeability-keep-obama-over-romney/\">18% gender gap</a> in his favor with women in April \u2013 and has lost it all. Equal numbers of women and men are now saying they support Romney in the <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/158048/romney-obama-among-likely-voters.aspx\">last</a> Gallup poll. This is a disaster because Democrats can only win with the traditional gender gap, which is usually in the double digits. </p> <p>The Romney team has managed rather brilliantly to obfuscate his position on every issue \u2013 very few women know that if you go to his website, you find out that he does not support a woman's right to abortion <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18563_162-57501172/romney-my-views-on-abortion-rights-are-clear-/\">except</a> in cases of rape or incest. Ryan is even more drastic in his extremism: supporting ending Planned Parenthood, for instance \u2013 which provides health care to 3 million Americans \u2013 and in <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/08/14/1119867/-Rachel-Maddow-Welcome-Congressman-Ultrasound-Ryan-to-the-Republican-Ticket\">favor</a> of punitive transvaginal probes for women who dare to choose abortion. Women are not aware, I think, of how invasive the Republican agenda is for their most personal healthcare decisions. The paradox is that the Republican message of 'smaller government' (get the state out of schools, out of healthcare, out of welfare) is reversed in Romney's radical plan for the far right <em>vis a vis </em>women's most intimate reproductive rights decisions. (To see a satirical take on the GOP agenda, one can watch the hilarious yet also tragic <a href=\"http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/87be7156f5/republicans-get-in-my-vagina\">Funny or Die video</a>, \"Republicans, Get in my Vagina\".) </p> <p>As for Romney's first executive order, should he win the presidency, must be to close Guant\u00e1namo. His next policies should involve the repeal of the Patriot Act, the closing of the Department of Homeland Security and the demise of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Defense_Authorization_Act\">National Defense Authorization Act</a>. Any equality women have achieved has come about through human rights activism and democracy protections. Paying attention to any other issue before freedom is restored in America is like legislating on the Titanic. </p> <p><em>Naomi Wolf is a regular columnist on Comment is free and author of Vagina: a New Biography</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jill-filipovic\">Jill Filipovic</a>: 'Romney needs to talk to women like we're people with rational political interests'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398169537\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/1/30/1233350245282/jill_filipovic_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Jill Filipovic\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>To appeal to women voters, Romney needs to talk to women like we're people with rational political interests, and knock off the condescension. So far, his understanding of women seems to center on his wife \u2013 instead of talking to us himself, he uses Ann as a sort of ambassador to a culture he clearly doesn't understand and doesn't particularly respect.</p> <p>He could speak to us directly about the economy and recognize that the recovery has disproportionately benefited men (even adjusting for the fact that job losses disproportionately impacted men). He could realize that we exist in our bodies, and the physical needs of 50% of the population aren't \"special\" or negligible. He could appreciate that we're a population as diverse as men, and that our interests extend beyond our roles as mothers and care-takers. And he could prove that he has, at any point, considered women to be equal players in society.</p> <p>Even his story (or \"<a href=\"http://blog.thephoenix.com/BLOGS/talkingpolitics/archive/2012/10/16/mind-the-binder.aspx#.UH6ge5hq8ng.facebook\">lie</a>\", as it's also known) at the last debate about soliciting \"binders full of women\" to fill cabinet positions is telling: A man who was a consultant and a businessman for decades didn't know <em>any</em> qualified women? That speaks volumes about his views on half the population, and those views are reflected in his strongly sexist policy positions.</p> <p>Other than the things he definitely <em>shouldn't</em> do that he's already pledged to do on his first day \u2013 overturning Obamacare and reinstituting the deadly <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/06/20/why_kenyan_women_fear_romney/\">Global Gag Rule</a> \u2013 I would love to see any president propose a Bill of Women's Rights, ensuring the basic things women require for equal participation in society: universal health care coverage (including contraception, abortion, pre-natal and well-baby care); equal pay; federally-mandated parental leave; subsidized high-quality childcare with well-paid workers and comprehensive assistance to low-income families. But that's about as likely as Romney legalizing the kind of drugs one would need to believe a \"pro-family, pro-life\" Republican president would support legislation that actually helps women, men, children and families live better lives. </p> <p><em>Jill Filipovic is a freelance writer and blogger at Feministe, and a practicing lawyer in New York City</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/tamara-winfrey-harris\">Tamara Winfrey Harris</a>: 'Romney has learned little from leafing through binders of women'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398169538\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/1/17/1326838687226/tamarawinfreyharris_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Tamara Winfrey Harris\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>For female voters like me, a candidate's image comes as a result of actions. That is why there is very little Mitt Romney can do before election day to convince me that his presidency would be good for women. His actions tell me just the opposite. For instance, the candidate has pledged to defund Planned Parenthood; voiced support for the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/birth-control-exemption-bill-the-blunt-amendment-killed-in-senate/2012/03/01/gIQA4tXjkR_story.html\">Blunt Amendment</a>, a bill introduced to restrict access to birth control and said that he supports overturning Roe v Wade. For anyone concerned about reproductive healthcare, Romney's stance should chill the blood.</p> <p>But healthcare isn't the only area where Romney fails to demonstrate the love for the ladies his wife <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/08/29/ann_romney_love_mitt_please/\">crowed</a> about during the Republican National Convention. While advisers say that, as president, Romney would not repeal the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, he did <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/17/mitt-romney-lilly-ledbetter_n_1973446.html\">oppose</a> the measure when President Obama signed it in 2009, giving women better opportunity to sue over pay inequities. His running mate, Congressman Paul Ryan \u2013 the man Ledbetter herself says \"<a href=\"http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/08/16/lilly-ledbetter-paul-ryan-scares-me-to-death/\">scares me to death</a>\" \u2013 opposed the Act.</p> <p>If his positions on women's bodies and our ability to work for fair pay are any indication, Romney has learned little from leafing through \"binders of women\".</p> <p>But perhaps the candidate's rhetoric does not reveal his true intentions. Maybe he's simply rallying his conservative base and a real Romney presidency wouldn't be so radical. The first 100 days of a Romney administration could be very enlightening. A clue as to his authentic objectives may come from what a President Romney doesn't do in its early days. As a candidate, Romney has pledged to repeal the Affordable Care Act \"<a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/health/2011/11/23/375846/romney-pledges-to-repeal-obamacare-on-day-one/?mobile=nc\">on day one</a>\", cutting off millions of women and families from preventative care and ending no-cost birth control benefits. Ignoring the hyperbole in the pronouncement (rolling back the Act wouldn't be that easy), keeping the Affordable Care Act intact and not working toward its demise would be a first step in convincing me that Mitt gives a whit about women.</p> <p><em>Tamara Winfrey Harris is a blogger on What Tami Said, and editor of New Demographic's Anti-Racist Parent</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/deedee-garc-a-blas\">DeeDee Garcia Blase</a>: '[Romney] will have to pick a side and stick with it to the end'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398169539\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/red/blue_pics/2011/10/26/deedeegarciablase_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"DeeDee Garcia Blase\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It will be very hard for Mitt Romney to improve his image with women voters because he has reversed his stance on the pro-choice/pro-life issue too many times. His reversals make him appear like a populist politician driven by polls. Remember, Romney gave an oath to protect a woman's right to choose until he decided to run under the Republican presidential ticket. How can a pro-choice woman trust Romney after he went back on his word? On the other hand, how can a pro-life woman trust him when his campaign recently stated that abortion \"<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/16/mitt-romney-abortion-ad_n_1972251.html\">should be an option</a>\" in certain cases?<br> In order for Romney to garner the trust of women voters, he will have to pick a side and stick with it to the end, else mistrust will continue to pile up. Right now, women do not know what his real conviction on the issue, and we become much more considerate of politicians who stick to their convictions. As it stands, we still do not know where his heart is really at. A woman has never served on the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS); therefore, any president promoting women to the JCS within his first 100 days would give many of us a sigh of relief and encouragement. So many women in the US are related to sons, daughters or relatives currently serving our armed forces, and we are feeling apprehensive and pressure with regard to the multiple wars we have been engaged in. It would be helpful knowing that more women are part of the \"advisory committee\", which helps plan joint operations and resolutions of military problems because, as it stands, there appears to be too much testosterone fueling those key decisions. It would be helpful for us to see balance at a strategic leadership level.</p> <p><em>DeeDee Garcia Blase is founder of Somos Republicans, and the president of the National Tequila Party Movement, which promotes Hispanic Get Out the Vote initiatives</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/heidi-moore\">Heidi Moore</a>: 'it may be useful for Governor Romney to get the basics out of the way'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398169540\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/5/18/1337374473765/heidimoore_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Heidi Moore\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>If the current polls are to be believed, Mitt Romney is in line to draw the votes of roughly half the country. The question is: which half? What does Mitt Romney's half look like, and how do they picture the economic future under a Romney presidency? </p> <p>Governor Romney was correct in his \"binders full of women\" speech that America will not be on the road to economic recovery until women are sharing space in hiring decisions alongside equally qualified men. Unfortunately, the conversation around women in the workplace still seems to center around the most pragmatic basics being treated as romantic political dreams. For instance, it's difficult to picture a woman who will rush to the polls, full of passionate vigor, in support of the idea that it' going to be possible for her to one day have a good day at work <em>and</em> get home in time to pitch in for dinner or tuck in her kids. So it may be useful for Governor Romney to get the basics out of the way: we know that corporations respond to tax breaks. Would they also respond to tax incentives for businesses that show they pay their women as equally as they do men? </p> <p>You have to start rebuilding the economy somewhere.

Romney has surged to an average 4-point lead in key swing states due in large part to women supporting him, thus sending the Obama campaign in hyperbole overdrive. The ensuing panic by the left has resulted in the ridiculous, patronizing \"War on Women\" meme, followed by the insulting, \"vote like your lady parts depend on it\" that served only to turn women off Obama and move towards Romney.</p> <p>So excuse me if I find the question posed as a bit biased since it is President Obama who needs to change his tune with women. Whatever Mitt Romney is doing to move women to his side, he should keep doing it! He is leading in the popular vote <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/\">52% to 45%</a>, and for the first time in this campaign, now leads in the electoral college.</p> <p>While women in the Obama White House <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/blog/2012/10/17/fox-accuses-obama-of-pay-discrimination-to-defe/190722\">make less</a> than the men, as governor of Massachusetts, of Mitt Romney's 20 cabinet positions, <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/10/17/women-including-ex-cabinet-members-rally-around-romney-binder-project/\">ten were held by women</a>. In fact, his record from the 1990's is better than the top current Democratic governors and the upper echelons of Massachusetts government, and more representative of the female population than any state in the natio, according to a 2004 <a href=\"http://www.albany.edu/womeningov/\">State University of New York, Albany study</a>. It is my prediction, too, that Obama letting two high-ranking women in his administration, Hillary Clinton and Susan Rice, take the fall for his incompetency regarding the Benghazi attack that led to the murders of Ambassador Stevens and three other Americans \u2013 and his subsequent cover-up \u2013 will heat up as an issue for women in these weeks before election day.</p> <p>That Obama and his cheerleaders in the media are overplaying their hand on the awkward \"binders\" phrasing as if it is a gaffe, is telling: Romney is trending upwards, and the Obama campaign has even had to abandon large chunks of their firewall strategy as Mitt Romney pulls close, even or ahead in states they thought were reliably Obama's. Once women <em>and</em> men got to see Mitt Romney in the debates without the biased media filter, they saw a man quite different than the one Obama and the left described. And they like him. Binders and binders full of women like and trust him. Obama is finding out the hard way that women vote with their brain and their wallets, and that's very bad news for him.</p> <p>A President Romney should repeat his stellar record of hiring women from his time as governor. And unlike President Obama, he can pay women what he pays the men, leading by example, whereas Barack Obama talks the talk, but won't walk the walk. Romney is also onto something big by pointedly addressing the growing number of women in poverty under Obama. His personal history of helping people combined with his business success and saving the Olympics can be put to good use by tackling this problem, rather than just putting more women on welfare and food stamps as has been the case in the Obama presidency. A President Romney should take the problem seriously. He would be a hero.</p> <p><em>Cher Jacobus is a Republican political strategist, pundit and writer</em></p>",

(The structure of D'Souza's argument brings to mind the business plan of the famous underpants-collecting gnomes, from the animated series South Park: \"1. Collect underpants, 2. ?, 3. Profit!\") It also lingers salaciously on what he claims are details of the sex life of Obama's mother, whose \"sexual adventuring,\" D'Souza says, \"may seem a little surprising in view of the fact that she was a large woman who kept getting larger.\"</p> <p>Let's take the high road here, and feel no Schadenfreude in response to this week's news that D'Souza is resigning as president of an evangelical college, following allegations about a relationship with a much younger woman who isn't the woman he married. The steamier details, he insists, are groundless rumour-mongering without the slightest connection to reality. Perhaps someone should base a documentary on them?</p> <h2>Daily Show and Fox News<br></h2> <p>*Reasonable people may differ as to whether Obama committed a \"gaffe\" when he told Jon Stewart, on Thursday night's Daily Show, that the deaths of four Americans in the Benghazi embassy attack were \"not optimal\". It sounded glib, but then he was only reflecting the language of the question: Stewart had wondered whether the White House's initial reaction was \"not the optimal response\". The campaigns continue to squabble over exactly how quickly the president declared that the incident had been an act of terrorism \u2013 and thanks to Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, things just got murkier. \"Declaring something an act of terror,\" she noted on air, \"does not necessarily mean you are declaring it a terror attack.\" Such reasoning could serve her ideological allies well: sure, Romney wants generous tax cuts for the top 5% of earners, but that doesn't necessarily mean he wants to cut their taxes generously. Next week on Fox, a panel discussion on Frege's principles of inferential logic. Or Bill O'Reilly shouting. One of the two.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama is scheduled to fly to the Camp David presidential retreat near Washington later for three days of seclusion to prepare for the third and final debate with Mitt Romney on Monday as polls suggest the race remains too close to call.</p> <p>Obama and Romney swapped jokes at a charity event in New York on Thursday night but there will be few jokes on Monday at the debate in Boca Raton, Florida, an encounter devoted to foreign affairs.</p> <p>The president had enjoyed high approval ratings in foreign affairs until recently, mainly as a result of the killing on his watch of Osama bin Laden. But the Republicans see the president as vulnerable over the assault on the US consulate in Benghazi that left the US ambassador and three other Americans dead.</p> <p>Obama's 2008 Republican presidential opponent John McCain took the president to task Friday, over his choice of words during an interview on Jon Stewart's Daily Show on Thursday night in which he oddly referred to the deaths as \"not optimal\". </p> <p>\"The optimal line, of course, is very regrettable and makes me a little sad,\" McCain told Fox.</p> <p>Obama used the description in response to a question from Stewart, who was the first to use the word \"optimal\".</p> <p>Stewart said: \"I would say, and even you would admit, it was not the optimal response.\"</p> <p>Obama replied: \"Here is what I will say: when four Americans get killed, it's not optimal.\"</p> <p>Romney fumbled a question about Libya in their second debate on Tuesday in New York, but will get a chance on Monday to redeem himself. The Republicans are questioning why the Obama administration has offered conflicting accounts of what happened at the consulate, by first blaming it on a demonstration by people allegedly upset over a US-made anti-Muslim film and later on al-Qaida affiliates.</p> <p>McCain said it had been obvious to him soon afterwards that it was more than just a demonstration. \"You really don't have to be a CIA analyst or a station chief to know an attack with mortars and rocket-propelled grenades, and which lasted for eight hours, is not a spontaneous demonstration,\" he said, adding that the responses of the administration amounted either to a cover-up or gross incompetence.</p> <p>Another layer of intrigue was added to the story Friday when the Associated Press reported that the CIA station chief in Libya told Washington within 24 hours of the attack that there was evidence it was carried out by militants. However, it was unclear who, if anyone, saw the cable outside the CIA at that point and how high up in the agency the information went.</p> <p>Both Obama and Romney spent Friday campaigning before heading for their respective debate preparation camps, with Romney basing himself in Boca Raton.</p> <p>Obama went to George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, the second time in a fortnight he has spoken on campus in the crucial swing state, where students and the youth vote as the key to his winning. He ridiculed Romney for what he claimed were repeated policy switches, saying the Republican candidate had forgotten his previous positions \u2013 a condition he labelled 'Romnesia'.</p> <p>As well as Libya, Obama and Romney are set to argue over Iran, Syria and the Israeli-Palestinian issue. Obama administration officials have hinted that Obama, in his second term, with no election to be fought, would be braver in tackling the Israeli-Palestinian issue, which, like Tony Blair, he views as a source of friction in the Middle East and elsewhere in the Muslim world.</p> <p>On Iran and Syria, Romney and Obama are not particularly far apart in terms of policy, despite Romney sounding more bellicose than Obama on both issues.</p> <p>New polls taken after Tuesday's debate, which both conservatives and Democrats gave to Obama on points, showed Obama ahead in Iowa, which has long been a swing state, and Wisconsin, which had been listed as an Obama hold but had recently been moved to a toss-up.</p> <p>An NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll put Obama on 51% and Romney on 45% in Wisconsin and 51% to 43% in Iowa.</p> <p>Most polls suggest the two are in a dead heat nationally. Gallup, in contrast with most of the rest, has Romney with a big lead nationally, on 52% to 45%. But Public Policy Polling has Obama on 48% to Romney's 47% and Rasmussen has the two tied at 48%.</p>",
  "<p>To Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, Briana Mihok is gold dust. She ticks the three boxes that qualify her to be exactly the type of voter the presidential candidates are focusing all their attention on as the White House race enters its final three weeks. She is undecided, she lives in an unexpectedly competitive state and \u2013 by far the most important of all \u2013 Mihok is a woman.</p> <p>Presidential elections always come down to a narrow territorial battle for advantage in a handful of swing states. But after almost a year of constant campaigning and millions of dollars of television advertising, it became clear this week that both candidates believe that the defining battle of 2012 is now for female voters. </p> <p>At the second presidential debate on Tuesday night on Long Island, Obama and Romney clashed repeatedly on women's issues, ranging from workplace equality to access to contraception. Romney said women had suffered worse under Obama's economic policies, while the president in turn tied issues like equal pay and healthcare to economic recovery, describing women as important breadwinners in their family. </p> <p>A look at the polls over the last two weeks explains why. Since the first debate, Romney, whose campaign had been faltering, has surged back into contention, <a href=\"www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/08/romney-gains-lead-obama-poll\">overtaking Obama in some national polls</a>. Behind those headline figures is the first sign of a big shift among women, with Obama's massive advantage cut back to a few points. </p> <p>But for some of the women whose votes the campaigns so openly covet, the sudden intensity of these arguments has done little to clarify matters. </p> <p>Mihok, a mother of one and registered Republican, said she was struck by Romney's ignorance of issues that concern women during Tuesday's debate. </p> <p>She cited the answer he gave to a question about workplace equality in which he said he understood the need to be \"flexible\" in order to have women in the workforce. Giving the example of his chief of staff, who had two children of school age, Romney told the audience at Hofstra university: \"She said: 'I can't be here until 7 or 8 o'clock at night: I need to be able to get home at 5 o'clock so I can be there for making dinner for my kids and being with them when they get home from school.' So we said: 'Fine. Let's have a flexible schedule so you can have hours that work for you.'\"</p> <p>Romney's comments were \"weird\", said Mihok, a 32-year-old policy analyst for a non-profit research company at the University of Pittsburgh. She has been leaning towards Obama in recent weeks.</p> <p>\"My husband and I both work, and flexible work hours are just as important to my husband as they are to me,\" she said. \"Unfortunately governor Romney showed a real ignorance when it comes to women's issues.\"</p> <p>Mihok, who did not watch Tuesday's debate but discussed it with friends and read about it afterwards, said Obama put forward a better case for women. \"President Obama, with his background and his upbringing, has the opportunity to see first hand what is important to women and their families. Look at the statement about his grandmother training men for positions for which men got higher pay and better promoted, yet she never had that opportunity. That legacy is still around, and it's important to recognise that.\"</p> <p>But while that's good news for Obama, Mihok said women's issues would not be at the front of her mind when she came to cast her ballot on 6 November.</p> <p>She is not alone. Mihok is one of a number of undecided female voters from Pennsylvania whom the Guardian is talking to over the course of the election <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/11/pennsylvania-women-romney-obama\">to find out what is important to them</a>. None of them cited equal pay or social issues as top of the list of things important to their vote, although three out of five cited affordable healthcare as ranking top alongside the economy. </p> <p>\"Who can say what women need or want?\" said Judy Beck, 52, a grandmother and divorced mother of three from O'Hara township in Allegheny County. \"We are really just people.\"</p> <p>The issues most important to Beck's vote are the economy, foreign policy and the partisan makeup of Congress, but she said she did not hear anything on any of these issues that would make her change her mind, she said.</p> <p>Shireen Parsons, 68, a grandmother and community organiser from Summit Hill, Carbon County, was also unconvinced by the efforts to appeal to women. \"I'm old and cranky and sceptical,\" said Parsons, an independent. \"Women voters are smarter than most politicians think. When Romney talked about women, just how many women did he have in his cabinet? I've no idea but I would like to know.\"</p> <h2>'What decade does Mitt Romney think he's living in?'</h2> <p>Pennsylvania is typically Democratic but the race for its 20 electoral college votes has tightened considerably since the first debate. </p> <p>It has a particularly marked gender divide among voters, as well as a higher pay disparity among men and women. Women earn almost 81\u00a2 to a male worker's dollar, compared to the national average of 82\u00a2.</p> <p>Of the five women, three are Republican, one is a Democrat and one an independent. In the last two weeks, one of the Republicans has decided to vote for Obama, with another two leaning that way. But this week, the Democrat said she is leaning heavily towards Romney.</p> <p>Beck, who is \"principally a Republican\" because of her belief in less government, has made up her mind to vote for Obama over the course of the campaign.</p> <p>She said that the most recent arguments over women from the candidates has \"solidified my leaning towards the Obama campaign\".</p> <p>\"Obama didn't get as specific as Mitt Romney. Romney was too specific and it was apparent he doesn't have a clue. Obama mentioned his mother was a single mother, and he understands there are single mothers who need to make a living and that both men and women need to work.\"</p> <p>Obama answered the equal pay question during Tuesday's debate by referring to his upbringing by a single mother and grandmother who trained men for jobs that paid them more and ranked them higher. He cited the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which makes it easier for women to sue over pay discrimination, as one of his first official acts in office. And he cited childcare tax credits as a factor in whether women can become the breadwinners.</p> <p>\"These are not just women's issues,\" the president said. \"These are family issues. These are economic issues. And one of the things that makes us grow as an economy is when everybody participates and women are getting the same fair deal as men are.\"</p> <p>These comments chimed with the Pennsylvania women. Romney's answer to the same question was to insist that his record when governor or Massachusetts was one of equality. His description of his efforts to hire women into his cabinet <a href=\"http://blog.thephoenix.com/BLOGS/talkingpolitics/archive/2012/10/16/mind-the-binder.aspx\">were pilloried as wrong-footed and false</a>, and he has been widely ridiculed for his \"binders full of women\" remark about female appointments to his cabinet.</p> <p>Beck said that Romney reminds her of an old boss who refused her a raise because he told her \"the married men need it first\".</p> <p>\"That was back in 1987,\" she said. \"It was wrong then, and it is so much more wrong now. Any suggestion that a woman should be paid any differently is ridiculous. What decade does Mitt Romney think he's living in?</p> <p>\"Romney does not like anyone to disagree with him, You need to be the president but you also need to listen to advice. It seems to me he assumes he has all the answers.\"</p> <p>Like Beck, Parsons said she found herself being more sceptical of Romney than Obama. </p> <p>\"Romney believes that life begins at conception, but he said he wouldn't legislate against a woman's right to abortion. I don't believe that,\" she said.</p> <p>\"Because of Obama's upbringing and who he is and also because of his wife, he tends to do better among women. I'm inclined to trust some things that Obama says than anything Mitt Romney says. I'm not sure why.</p> <p>\"On the other hand I see what Obama has failed to do for women at the bottom layer. He is as much owned by corporate interests as other politicians. They work for corporate interests and leave poor people women and children at the bottom of the heap.\"</p> <p>Joanne Quinn-Smith, 63, a talkshow host, publisher of an online news network and CEO of a marketing company, praised Obama for talking about women as breadwinners. \"If I work as hard as a man I want to get paid like a man,\" she said. </p> <p>She also pointed out the gender pay disparity in Pennsylvania, but said the economy was her number one concern. </p> <p>\"I want someone who can bring us out of this (recession),\" she said. \"Someone who wants to drive business or someone who wants to drive spending that is supported by taxes? I think I just told you where I am leaning. Someone needs to say: 'We've spent enough money, let's re-organise, let's tighten our belts.' Who is better to do that than someone from a business environment?\"</p> <p>Quinn-Smith said that she thought that Romney would be successful in gaining votes among women in higher income brackets.</p> <p>But, despite leaning towards the Republican, she is still not sure. \"In the last Guardian piece someone said, it is about who you hate less.\"</p> <p>She compared the election to a college student \"going home for the weekend and talking to your parents for advice, and you need them to say something wonderful about what's going on and you don't feel any better because you haven't gotten it.\"</p>",
  "<p>A Republican congressman has said that abortions should not be allowed even when the mother's life is at risk because of advances in \"modern technology and science\".</p> <p>Joe Walsh of Illinois told reporters on Thursday that \"you can't find one instance\" where it has been necessary to perform an abortion due to the risk to the mother's life, citing medical advances.</p> <p>The comments have prompted criticism, with some comparing Walsh's remarks to fellow Republican Todd Akin's infamous assertion that \"legitimate rape\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/19/republican-todd-akin-rape-pregnancy\">rarely results in pregnancy</a>. </p> <p>Walsh was speaking to reporters after defining himself as \"pro-life without exception\" <a href=\"http://www.wgnradio.com/news/top/chi-walsh-duckworth-clash-on-medicare-abortion-20121018,0,4118256.story \">during a debate with Democratic challenger Tammy Duckworth</a>. Walsh was asked if he was saying it was never necessary to terminate a pregnancy to save a mother's life.</p> <p>\"Absolutely,\" he responded, according to WGN radio.</p> <p>\"With modern technology and science, you can't find one instance,\" Walsh said. He went on: \"There is no such exception as 'life of the mother', and as far as 'health of the mother': same thing.\"</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1012/82620.html \">Politico noted</a>, Walsh's comments were particularly remarkable given that congresswoman Jackie Speier, a Democrat from California, spoke on the House floor 18 months ago about having an abortion because a pregnancy was threatening her life.</p> <p>Medical experts note that there are some cases where the only option in the case of complications sustained during pregnancy is to abort the foetus. PubMed Health, the online medical library funded by the National Center for Biotechnology Information <a href=\" http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001897/\">notes that some complications in pregnancy, such as an ectopic pregnancy,</a> are life-threatening to the mother. \"The developing cells must be removed to save the mother's life,\" the resource states.</p> <p>Walsh's remarks also come after Todd Akin, the Republican Senate candidate for Missouri, made his infamous assertion that pregnancy as a result of \"legitimate rape\" is rare as \"the female body has ways to try and shut that whole thing down\".</p> <p>Walsh, competing with Duckworth for the eighth congressional district in Illinois, is a Tea Party favourite who was elected in the 2010 mid-term elections. His \"pro-life without exception\" stance is shared by Mitt Romney's running mate Paul Ryan.</p> <p>Akin ignored calls from both Democrats and Republicans to drop out of the Missouri race following his rape comments in August, although polling suggests he is a <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blos/burns-haberman/2012/10/dscc-poll-mccaskill-up-in-missouri-138929.html \">long way behind</a> Democrat Claire McCaskill in the state.</p>",
  "<p>The European Union looked condemned to months of bitter infighting over money, budgets and the euro on Friday following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/19/eurozone-crisis-eu-summit-banking-supervision\" title=\"\">a summit where leaders merely papered over the deep divisions between them</a>.</p> <p>While claims of victory were routine and ubiquitous, chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany appeared highly satisfied with the minimalist outcome that failed to resolve any issues of substance and shelved some big decisions until December.</p> <p>The main issues revolved around new regimes and institutions to help stabilise the euro longer term by enabling the use of bailout funds to shore up weak banks directly as well as putting the eurozone's banks under a new single supervisory agency, the European Central Bank.</p> <p>While the leaders decided to agree the legal framework on the new banking supervisor by January <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/18/francois-holland-angela-merkel-divided-over-european-economic-policy\" title=\"\">during a fraught session that dragged on until after 3am on Friday</a>, all other substantial and highly contested matters were left largely untouched.</p> <p>With the pressure from the financial markets on the euro and on the borrowing costs of weak single currency members relatively low, it appeared that EU leaders felt less need to take bolder decisions.</p> <p>If the January deadline is met \u2014 a big if, given the web of complex and controversial issues entailed in designing an effective banking supervisor for the eurozone while meeting the objections of the 10 countries not in the currency \u2014 it will then take several months at least for the supervisory authority to be functioning.</p> <p>That, in turn, means that it will be at least a year before the eurozone can tackle the sovereign debt crisis more fundamentally by pouring bailout funds directly into ailing banks without first lending to governments and worsening their debt burdens. The decision to take this action came in June at a previous summit but became swiftly engulfed in confusion and dispute. The meeting on Thursday and Friday failed to dispel the confusion and bring clarity.</p> <p>All the signs were that, barring a re-eruption of the crisis in the markets, substantial eurozone action would have to wait until Merkel is probably re-elected to a third term in September next year.</p> <p>President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France, who came to the summit with an anti-Berlin agenda, accusing Merkel of being too guided in her crisis management by domestic German politics, said she had her own deadline for euro crisis action \u2013 13 September 2013, the German general election.</p> <p>Merkel denied this utterly. \"I hadn't even thought of that. That's just not right,\" she said.</p> <p>But Jean-Claude Juncker, the prime minister of Luxembourg, confirmed that the creation of the new safety and rescue regime for eurozone banks was likely to take a while.</p> <p>\"The detailed questions of what should be done how, when and by whom will be tackled in the course of 2013. I hope in the first quarter but it can get dragged into autumn.\"</p> <p>And Merkel also left herself plenty of wriggle-room for delays: \"There are complicated questions to clarify and we'll see in December if we complete it or not.\"</p> <p>The summit featured the first big clash in the three-year crisis between Germany and France, highlighting how the troubles over the single currency and sovereign debt have moved to the very heart of the EU.</p> <p>Hollande's key aim was to speed up the establishment of the new banking regime, while Merkel emphasised \"quality over speed\" as part of her delaying tactics.</p> <p>The result was a compromise that favoured the French on the timeline, but Merkel on the substance.</p> <p>Arguably the biggest loser was Spain, the biggest worry in the eurozone, since it became clear that it would not benefit in the foreseeable future from the direct bank recapitalisation which may not kick in now until 2014.</p> <p>Spanish diplomats told the French news agency AFP that they had given up hope of being able to tap the bailout fund for the banks without having the loans put on the government books adding to Spain's debt level.</p> <p>Merkel made clear that any direct bank recapitalization, if and when it is allowed, would not be retroactive and could only be applied for future contingencies. Hollande had tried and failed to have the policy made retroactive.</p>",

Here's why:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mariano Rajoy, the Spanish prime minister, declared himself pleased with the summit. Perhaps he still hopes that he will eventually receive help. But tonight it seems more likely that Spain appears to have been sacrificed for the sake of the bargain: Germany would agree to the principle of direct bank recapitalisation in 2013, possibly before its general election in the autumn of 2013, on the understanding that Spain would not actually ask for the money.</p> <p>If so, this is probably bad news for Ireland, which hoped to benefit from a retroactive arrangement to shift its banking burden to the euro zone.

The SFF website claims that at \"one time it was <a href=\"http://www.somsoccer.com/english/view.php?id=551\" title=\"\">the largest and the most beautiful facility in Africa and the Arab world</a>\", hosting international tournaments including the All Arab games and All African games.</p> <p>But the stadium was occupied when Somalia's civil war erupted in 1991 and has since been a base for armies and militia whose graffiti still scars the crumbling walls. In January 2007 it fell into the hands of Ethiopian forces who were based there until early 2009.</p> <p>It was then controlled by the Islamist militant group al-Shabaab, which used it as a training base \u2013 the pitch became a firing range. The group bans the playing and watching of football in areas it holds.</p> <p>Al-Shabaab was driven out of the capital by Amisom in August last year. The stadium has since been home to thousands of Amisom peacekeepers supporting the Somali government. The former changing rooms were used by soldiers for donating blood and other preparations for battle. Pictures on the SFF website from 2009 <a href=\"http://www.somsoccer.com/english/view.php?id=83\" title=\"\">show huge bushes growing on the pitch</a>. \"If you get inside the stadium you will feel like that you are in forest,\" it says.</p> <p>Mogadishu is enjoying a precarious but discernible uplift in security, including last month's election of a president and parliament, and the capture of al-Shabaab's last stronghold, the port city of Kismayo.</p> <p>Col Ali Hamud, an Amisom spokesman, said some public buildings and areas, including the stadium, had to be used by Amisom for security reasons. \"Now the time has come to leave those infrastructures to the youth,\" he told the BBC Somali service.</p> <p>Unless \"technical issues\" arose, Amisom should have enough time to prepare to move elsewhere by December, the colonel added.</p> <p>SSF officials visited the stadium earlier this week. Abdi Qani Said Arab, its secretary general, said: \"This is time to get the Somali soccer facilities back into the SFF hands, because our football is now recovering from years of conflicts and all soccer facilities must get back to our hands.\"</p> <p>Football can play a vital part in disarming child soldiers and \"creating friendship among people\", he added.</p> <p>Somalia's national football team, nicknamed the Ocean Stars, are currently forced to play all matches away from home. They are ranked 188th in the world by Fifa.</p> <p>Thousands of Somali expats have poured back into Mogadishu with numerous buildings now under construction. However, sporadic suicide bombings and assassinations continue.

  "<p>David Cameron's hopes of attracting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/10/police-commissioners-star-quality-shine\" title=\"\">\"big local figures\" and not just politicians</a> to contest next month's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/10/police-crime-commissioner-elections-leap?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">police commissioner elections</a> have been dashed with the disclosure that three-quarters of those standing for the main parties already hold elected office.</p> <p>A Guardian/Police Foundation data analysis of the 199 declared candidates shortly before the close of nominations at noon on Friday also reveals the Liberal Democrats have adopted a half-hearted approach to the coalition policy, with only 23 candidates standing in the 41 police force contests.</p> <p>The analysis confirms the elections will be an overwhelmingly male affair, with only 34 women standing, just over 17% of the total. Labour is putting forward 15 women candidates, the Conservatives six and Liberal Democrats four.</p> <p>Among the candidates are 13 magistrates, who would have to step down from the bench if they were elected.</p> <p>The prime minister and the home secretary, Theresa May, expressed the hope that a new breed of independent, high-profile figures could be persuaded to stand for the powerful new posts. Winners will be able to to hire and fire chief constables, set police budgets, hold the police to account and develop a wide role in the criminal justice system.</p> <p>But while the tally of nominated candidates includes 63 independents, excluding the minor parties such as Ukip and the English Democrats, more than half are existing police authority members or former police officers, magistrates or military personnel. Few, if any, have more than a local profile.</p> <p>When he launched the hunt for candidates, Cameron said it was \"a big job for a big local figure. It's a voice for the people, someone to lead the fight against crime, and someone to hold the police to account if they don't deliver \u2026 This isn't just for politicians, but for community leaders and pioneers of all sorts. People with real experience who've done real things and run organisations, whether they are charities or companies.\"</p> <p>A string of high-profile candidates who were tipped to run have all dropped out. The first was the Gulf war veteran Colonel Tim Collins, whom May showcased as a Tory candidate during her 2011 Conservative party conference speech. He quit after a dispute over whether he could do the job part-time.</p> <p>Other names canvassed included the TV crime presenter Nick Ross, Falklands veteran <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/02/simon-weston-police-crime-commissioner\" title=\"\">Simon Weston</a>, and former Police Federation chairman Jan Berry. Former ministers who had been tipped for the post included Jacqui Smith, Hazel Blears and Ann Widdecombe, but none has made it to the starting line.</p> <p>Jon Collins, of the Police Foundation, which is tracking candidates, said those standing as independents had only a slim chance of being elected without a party political label. He said most of those standing for the main parties came from a political background.</p> <p>\"It is not a surprise but it is not the way the reform was initially sold,\" said Collins. \"The idea was that some fresh faces without a background in politics might come forward. This group of candidates might not be what might have been expected when the reform was first proposed but it doesn't mean they will not do a good job.\"</p> <p>The police minister, Damian Green, has defended the quality of candidates, saying that any election that attracts a former deputy prime minister \u2013 Lord Prescott \u2013 and a former air chief marshall \u2013 Sir Clive Loader \u2013 must be worthwhile.</p> <p>Prescott is among seven former Labour ministers who are standing. The party has 24 current or former councillors among its 41 candidates, who include 12 who are members of the police authorities the commissioners will replace. Labour has one former police officer standing: Ron Hogg, who was deputy chief constable of Durham.</p> <p>The Conservatives have two former MPs standing, including Michael Mates, who resigned as a Northern Ireland minister over his connection with the jailed tycoon Asil Nadir. There are 24 current or former councillors among their 41 candidates \u2013 the same as Labour. They have five former police officers and eight ex-military figures, including Loader, who names Ronald Reagan as his political hero. The Tory candidate in Essex, Nicholas Alston, a defence and security expert, is the son of a former Essex chief constable and was born in a police station.</p> <p>Nineteen of the 23 Liberal Democrat candidates are current or former councillors. The other four are former police or military officers.</p> <p>Of the 63 independents, there are four chairs of police authorities who are campaigning to keep politics out of policing, while 22 are former police officers or from a military background.</p>",
  "<p>Brazilians will return to the polls next week less than a month after voters elected a record number of women as mayors, but gender equality is still a distant goal in a political culture long dominated by men.</p> <p>Only one female candidate will participate in the 50-city mayor run-offs on 28&#xa0;October, which means Brazil will continue to lag behind most other Latin American states in terms of the gender balance among elected officials.</p> <p>The popularity of Brazil's first female president, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/dilma-rousseff\" title=\"\">Dilma Rousseff</a>, and the planned widening of a quota system for women candidates have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/02/dilma-rousseff-pledge-empower-women-brazil\" title=\"\">raised expectations of rapid change</a>. But gains have proved steady rather than spectacular.</p> <p>In the first round of voting this month, <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/report-brazil-elects-record-number-women\" title=\"\">621 women were elected as mayors</a>, up from 504 in 2008 and 187 in 1996.</p> <p>The results prompted a commentator from the Hoje media group to declare \"women were the major victors in this election\", a conclusion echoed by several domestic newspapers. Candidates, however, remained more cautious.</p> <p>\"We are living a very important moment in Brazilian democracy, with the growth of female participation in politics and other types of power, which is a fundamental move forward to equal rights,\" said Teresa Surita, whose win in Boa Vista has made her the first Brazilian women to win a fourth term as mayor.</p> <p>But she emphasised that there was still a long way to go. Although women make up 52% of the electorate in Brazil, they account for only 12% of mayors (less than half the proportion in the UK and 5 percentage points lower than the US). \"The disproportion of legislative power between the genders is still huge,\" says Surita.</p> <p>Only one female mayoral candidate \u2013 Vanessa Grazziotin in Manaus \u2013 will run-off in the second-round of voting. The proportion of new women councillors elected this year rose only fractionally to 13.3% from 12.5% in 2008.</p> <p>In a recent UN study, Brazil ranked 116th out of 143 countries in terms of the number of women in the national legislature.</p> <p>It has been hoped that the gap would close more dramatically, partly as a result of affirmative action and largely because of the positive examples set by successful women politicians such as Rousseff, who enjoys approval ratings of more than 60%, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/may/22/forests.conservation\" title=\"\">Marina Silva, the environmental campaigner</a>.</p> <p>In 1995, Brazil imposed quotas on political parties, requiring that 20% of candidates should be women. That has since been raised to 30%. Next year, the ruling Workers party has pledged to allot 50% of council positions to women to help balance political entry-level positions.</p> <p>However, the largely voluntary quotas have been less effective than more stringent targets set in other Latin American nations.</p> <p>In Argentina \u2013 the first country in the world to introduce quotas \u2013 40% of national legislators are women. The president is Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner. In Bolivia, which introduced quotas 15 years ago, the proportion is even higher at 47%.</p> <p>Change in Brazil has come more slowly, but commentators believe it is still profound.</p> <p>Oswaldo Munteal, a history lecturer at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro said the 2010 victory of Dilma was a turning point.</p> <p>\"Women have been less corrupt in politics. What is happening now is a consequence of that fact,\" he said. \"I think we're living a very important political moment for women.\"</p> <p>In many other areas of Brazilian society, women still lag behind men in terms of promotions and income, but the disparities appear to be shrinking. In 2007, women earned 67% of male salaries for comparable jobs. In 2011, the difference was 70.4%. Unemployment among women has fallen from 11% to 9.1%. For men there has been a similar fall, from 6.2% to 4.9%.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Carolina Massote</em></p>",
  "<p>At a <a href=\"www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/19/barack-obama-mitt-romney-jokes\">charity dinner in New York on Thursday night</a>, standup comedians - sorry, presidential candidates Barack Obama and Mitt Romney had the crowd roaring with a sparkling line in not-remotely-unscripted gags. At one point Obama joked that he wished he could go by his middle name, like Romney (whose first name is Willard). This is of course a <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1718255,00.html\">somewhat taboo subject</a>, as Obama's middle name is Hussein. </p> <p>Aside from replacing a first name that you don't like, what exactly is a middle name <em>for</em>? Some cultures have set naming conventions, but if you have free rein as a parent, how do you choose one? There's the \"nod to a member of the family who we must commemorate/express our love for/placate lest they cut us out of the will\" middle name, which must account for a fair few unfortunate babies saddled with names last in favour around the end of the Victorian era. </p> <p>Then there's the \"Yes, I know you adore X famous person, but no way are we naming our child after them, are you MAD? Oh God, OK, if you must, have the middle one\" route. A survey in the office this morning revealed a colleague's flatmate has the middle name La Toya for this reason. Yes, really.</p> <p>And of course there's the \"I lost a bet/was drunk at the registry office/it'll be a nice talking point in job interviews\" school of thought. Another colleague, who shall remain nameless, gave her son the middle name Vuvuzela. It was during the 2010 World Cup, and we can only assume it seemed like a good idea at the time. In her defence, apparently \"vuvuzela\" means \"celebration\" as well as being the world's most annoying plastic horn.</p> <p>Share your sad stories of a lifetime saddled with middle-moniker ridicule, or entertaining tales of why you gave your offspring a name that might sound a bit silly in English but means \"the gentle glow of morning dew on a rose\" in Swahili, so it's beautiful really.</p>",
  "<p>At some point this year, somewhere in the US, a teenage girl will decide she wants to have sex. She might not know when, or who with, but she has made that choice. Unfortunately for her, this is a turbulent and uncertain year to be making sexual and reproductive health choices in the US.</p> <p>If a student, she might have been relieved when Barack Obama's <a href=\"http://www.healthcare.gov/law/index.html\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Affordable Care Act</a> passed in June, knowing she can access student health plans that provide free contraception. She may already be benefiting from the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/teenpregnancy/PreventTeenPreg.htm\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Teenage Pregnancy Prevention Initiative</a> launched by Obama in 2010, which funds school sex education programmes that show evidence of success, those predominantly promoting contraception over abstinence.</p> <p>But this is an election year and early in 2012 voters got an idea of what to expect from the Republicans' presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, when he challenged contraceptive coverage included in the health reforms. Along with many Republicans, Romney supported an amendment that would exempt employers with moral objections from including contraception in employees' health plans. Though the amendment failed, Romney promised to not only \"undo\" the contraceptive mandate but to repeal the entire act on his first day in office.</p> <p>\"They could starve it financially, cripple it even if they can't repeal entirely,\" explains Adam Sonfield, of the <a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Guttmacher Institute</a>, which specialises in sexual and reproductive health and rights. \"There are lots of opportunities to do damage.\"</p> <p>Whatever the route, his point is clear: as president, Romney will do all he can to ensure federal money isn't spent providing contraceptives.</p> <p>Voters could be forgiven for thinking Romney is less clear on abortion. When running for Senate in 1994 he said he believed \"abortions should be safe and legal in this country\". Now he wants <a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0410_0113_ZS.html\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Roe v Wade</a>, the court decision that legalised abortion nationally, overturned and would make further substantial cuts to reproductive health services, despite a federal ban on funding abortion.</p> <p>\"Republican and independent-leaning women may believe Romney is the man he said he was in 1994, but he's not,\" says Emilie Ailts, director of campaign group <a href=\"http://www.prochoicecolorado.org/\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">NARAL Pro-Choice Colorado</a>. \"If he gets to the White House he will defund Planned Parenthood.\"</p> <p>Whereas pro-choice Obama refused to bow down to Republican <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/government-shutdown-sticking-point-planned-parenthood/story?id=13328560\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">threats in 2011 to shut down government</a> unless funding was cut to <a href=\"http://www.plannedparenthood.org/\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Planned Parenthood</a>, Romney promises the opposite. Underscoring this is Romney's VP running mate, Paul Ryan. A fiscal conservative driven by pro-life ideology, Ryan co-sponsored a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/11/paul-ryan-personhood_n_1767760.html\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">federal measure to ban abortion in all cases</a> and is consistent with his position.</p> <p>\"Ryan practices what Romney preaches: Romney has pledged to 'get rid of Planned Parenthood'; Ryan voted repeatedly to defund Planned Parenthood. Romney said he would end the Title X program that funds birth control and cancer screenings; Ryan voted to eliminate Title X,\" says Ailts.</p> <p>The Guttmacher Institute estimates the <a href=\"http://www.hhs.gov/opa/title-x-family-planning/\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Title X family planning programme</a> is used by 25% of poor women wanting to obtain contraceptives and is vital to reduce unintended pregnancies. Obama wants more funding for this programme but Romney wants it axed and would also cut the widely used Medicaid programme through which low income women receive reproductive healthcare.</p> <p>Programmes promoting safe sex among young people could also be at risk under Romney, who supports sex education based on abstinence until marriage and funded such programmes when governor of Massachusetts. According to Douglas Kirby, senior research scientist at health and education research non-profit <a href=\"http://www.etr.org/home\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">ETR Associates</a>, Obama's pregnancy initiative is likely to reduce unprotected sex. The opposite could happen if the focus returns to abstinence.</p> <p>\"Because abstinence programs are generally less effective at reducing sexual risk, if they are promoted instead of comprehensive programs, more young people will probably engage in unprotected sex and teen pregnancy and STI rates will be a little higher than they otherwise would be,\" says Kirby.</p> <p>On some youth reproductive health policies, the candidates stand closer together. Last year, going against scientific advice, Obama restricted giving emergency contraception over-the-counter to under 17-year-olds unless they had a doctor's prescription. As a father of two daughters the decision to him was \"common sense\". Romney vetoed emergency contraceptive legislation in Massachusetts because it \"disregarded the importance of parental involvement\". Neither helps young girls wanting to discreetly access the morning-after pill.</p> <p>Overwhelmingly though, Romney would cause bigger problems for reproductive rights in the US and internationally. He promises to reinstate the \"<a href=\"http://www.genderhealth.org/the_issues/us_foreign_policy/global_gag_rule/\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Global Gag rule</a>\", a policy that prohibits international organisations receiving US funds from providing any abortion-related care. The rule, rescinded by Obama on his second day, has been an early act of every new party president since introduced in 1984 and has big repercussions.</p> <p>Improving access to reproductive services is key to <a href=\"http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/maternal.shtml\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">millennium development goal 5</a> \u2013 the target to improve maternal health. With this target lagging, there is a pressing urgency to ensure it is at the top of the agenda as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/01/panel-lead-global-development-agenda-named\" title=\"\">discussions begin on future development goals</a>.</p> <p>As a member of the UN, the US will contribute to negotiations about the post-2015 development agenda, which will steer a course for future sustainable development. But in contrast to Obama, a Romney administration is unlikely to recognise that a lack of access to sexual and reproductive health services only worsens cycles of poverty \u2013 at home and abroad.</p>",
