  "<p>After a week when the American media gave saturation coverage to the Democratic national convention, Mitt Romney has responded by buying his own air time. His latest <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/09/07/romney-campaign-releases-ads-for-8-battleground-states/\">television ad buys</a>, totalling $4.5m, is targeted at the states of Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, and Virginia. No one can fault Romney for going on the air in these states. They are all winnable for either candidate, and they were won by George W Bush at least once.</p> <p>The issue is that Romney is leaving himself with little room for error. If you assign the states to the candidate who is leading in the polls outside the ad states, you get a map that looks like this.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395836363\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/7/1347053230080/EVmap_460.jpg\" alt=\"Electoral votes map\" width=\"460\" height=\"344\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>By that map, President Obama holds a clear advantage \u2013 with 247 electoral votes to Mitt Romney's 191. Obama has 18 ways to reach 270 electoral votes, while Romney can name only 11 winning combinations. The arithmetic also dictates that Romney <em>must win</em> the state of Florida. If he doesn't, Obama has won a second term.</p> <p>If we assign <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2012-nevada-president-romney-vs-obama?gem\">Nevada</a>, where Romney hasn't led in a poll since April 2011, to President Obama, the math becomes even less forgiving for the Republican nominee. Now, Romney must win both Florida and Ohio. And that leaves Romney with only five ways to thread the needle.</p> <p>Such a game-plan is nothing new in presidential campaigns. Michael Dukakis tried the \"<a href=\"http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-10-17/news/8802070859_1_campaign-manager-susan-estrich-dukakis-campaign-officials-faneuil-hall\">18-state strategy</a>\" in 1988. Dukakis, of course, didn't come close, and lost 40 states. John Kerry's <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/Presidential_04/RCP_EC.html\">swing-state effort</a> in 2004 is another analogue. Kerry needed to win two of the three upper midwest states (Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin), plus Pennsylvania and either Florida or Ohio. Kerry managed parts one and two, to get to 252 electoral votes, but failed to take either Florida or Ohio.</p> <p>Mitt Romney's ad-buy map suggests a swing-state strategy even harder to deliver that Kerry's, however. Some of the toss-ups in the Bush/Kerry match-up leaned towards Kerry. Kerry rarely trailed in <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/Presidential_04/mn_polls.html\">Minnesota</a> or <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/Presidential_04/pa_polls.html\">Pennsylvania</a>. By contrast, only one swing state, <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2012-north-carolina-president-romney-vs-obama?gem\">North Carolina</a> and its 15 electoral votes, leans towards Romney at this point.</p> <p>In addition, you'll notice a lot of the word \"or\" and \"either\" in Kerry's plan: he had a variety of different paths to victory. Romney has a lot of \"ands\" and \"musts\" in order to win.</p> <p>So what does Romney think he's doing? There are three other states in which he could be competitive but where he's not advertising right now: Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Romney clearly has the money to go on the air in these states. So if he's not doing so now, does that mean Romney doubts he can win them?</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/24/why-next-two-weeks-make-break-romney-ryan\">polling</a> indicates that Wisconsin and its 10 electoral votes are definitely winnable. Since the selection of Paul Ryan as his vice-presidential nominee, Romney has led in two polls and trailed in three. Obama's edge is no greater than 2 points and probably closer to 1. It's the state where Governor Scott Walker survived a historic recall election in June 2012, and where George W Bush lost only narrowly in 2000 and 2004.</p> <p>Michigan is a more curious case. The <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2012-michigan-president-romney-vs-obama\">polls have been split</a>, to say the least, with the surveys showing everything from Romney losing from 7 points to him winning by 4. Most of the data indicate an Obama lead in the neighborhood of 4 to 5 points. Past results and the successful auto bailout say Michigan is a no-go, but Romney may benefit from some home-state advantage. </p> <p>Pennsylvania may be fool's gold for the Republican. It was a key swing state in 2000 and 2004. The western part of the state is rapidly becoming more conservative, but new-found Democratic strength in the Philadelphia suburbs may be too much to overcome. Romney hasn't led in a <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2012-pennsylvania-president-romney-vs-obama\">single poll</a> conducted in the state since February and trails now by at least 6 points. </p> <p>I wouldn't be surprised if Romney's own polling deters him from spending much time and money in Pennsylvania, but Michigan and especially Wisconsin ought to be worth the expenditure and effort. Ad buy allocations in these states will, if nothing else, force Obama to use resources of his own there.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/romney-will-play-in-michigan-and-wisconsin/2012/09/07/aa804e1a-f8e0-11e1-8b93-c4f4ab1c8d13_blog.html\">Romney's spokeswoman, Andrea Saul, insists</a> that the Romney team isn't giving up on Michigan, Pennsylvania, or Wisconsin. We'll watch to see if Romney is willing to back up that statement with media buying.</p> <p>Right now, though, the smart money says that Romney's advertising spending looks like that of a losing team.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/kim-kardashian\" title=\"\">Kim Kardashian</a> is in a makeup chair under giant&#xa0;rollers, looking down at her phone and intermittently up again, to meet her own eye in the mirror. We are at a studio in a Los Angeles suburb; various stylists and Kardashian hangers-on fill the room. \"One second,\" says the&#xa0;star's assistant, calling the group to order. Kardashian frowns at her phone. \"You guys,\" she says, \"what should I say? You guys?\" There is a moment's hush; Kardashian is passing a tweet.</p> <p>For those few who haven't yet had the pleasure, Kardashian is a 31-year-old US reality TV star, lately prominent in Britain, who has, since becoming famous in 2007, ascended to the level of a symptom in the culture. <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1086761/\" title=\"\">Keeping Up With The Kardashians</a>, currently in its seventh season, is contrived, sensationalist, repetitive and witless, but no more so than a lot of things one enjoys without accusing them of spiritual corruption. The difference in this case is reach. Twitter is an unreliable measure of influence, but Kardashian has nearly 16 million followers, putting her ninth in the world, three places behind President Obama. (Lady Gaga is number one; Taylor Swift number eight.) With her two sisters, Khlo\u00e9 and Kourtney, she runs a chain of clothing stores called Dash, has a Las Vegas-based outlet called Kardashian Khaos, promotes makeup and fashion lines under the label Kardashian Kollection, all of which act as window dressing for the business, merely, of being Kim Kardashian: a woman of above average looks, seemingly rather nice, who along with the rest of her family \u2013 emotionally speaking \u2013 strips on TV for tips. After the shoot, we sit in a courtyard at the back of the studio and Kardashian tries to explain what the fuss is about.</p> <p>There is an awful lot of fuss. For Kardashian haters, the tipping point came last year when she filed for divorce from Kris Humphries, a basketball player, after three months of marriage and a blizzard of wedding coverage said to have been worth many millions (she will dispute the numbers). The whole thing looked like a stunt to drum up trade for her TV show, although if it was, it backfired in that for a short while she was reviled as the most cynical woman in America. She seems to aggravate male actors in particular. Earlier this year, Jon Hamm unchivalrously referred to her as a \"fucking idiot\" in Elle magazine, as did Daniel Craig in GQ the year before. Kardashian takes all this with a certain laconic indifference, the standard LA response, heightened by what is probably an effort not to emote too much and generate wrinkles.</p> <p>\"When I hear people say [what are you famous for?], I want to say, what are you talking about?\" she says slowly, her eyes wide as a bushbaby's. \"I&#xa0;have a hit TV show. We've shot more episodes than <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043208/\" title=\"\">I Love Lucy</a>! We've been on the air longer than <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053479/\" title=\"\">The Andy Griffith Show</a>! I mean, these are iconic shows, so it blows my mind when people say that.\"</p> <p>But you're not performing; you're just being followed around by cameras\u2026</p> <p>\"But to be able to open up your life like that and to be so\u2026 if everyone could do it, everyone would. It doesn't make sense to me.\"</p> <p>The day before the interview, I go to Dash in Beverly Hills, the flagship store aimed at Kardashian's teen fan base. A bouncer stands outside letting teenagers in one by one, although the store is almost empty. \"There's a line!\" he calls out to baffled passers-by, and the teenagers snigger. Inside, the clothes are very nice; soft T-shirts, cute shorts and dresses, but that isn't why people are here. Kardashian says that since the show started airing, the store has become a \"tourist attraction\" and the stock is angled accordingly. After taking photos of themselves in front of a giant Kardashian family montage, the adolescents buy one of several items within their price-range; a $20 compact mirror; pencils for a few dollars; or a $10 bottle of water with the Kardashian sisters' photo on one side.</p> <p>\"Our water sells out all the time,\" Kardashian says. \"People collect them because each store has&#xa0;a different picture on the bottle.\"</p> <p>That's amazing.</p> <p>\"It's really crazy,\" she says. \"I mean, a water bottle? It's crazy.\" She blinks slowly at the wonder of effortless profiteering.</p> <p>Kardashian characterises her typical fan as \"a&#xa0;younger girl, like 15 or 16, who loves fashion, loves to be a girly girl, loves beauty, glam\", and whom she respects as a backwards projection of herself. If you can overlook the vacant materialism, she is in some ways not a bad role model. She points out that she is not \"your stick-skinny typical model\"; that she doesn't go out on benders; that she tries not to swear too much. \"I remember this one time when I used the F-word \u2013 and everyone was like, I can't believe you said that! You never say that! I am really cautious about what I say and do. If I look at the message I'm portraying, I think it definitely is be who you are, but be your best you.\"</p> <p>Whether or not you approve of the show, she has wrought a successful business out of thin air. It's also worth pointing out, given how snotty the fashion industry is towards Kim Kardashian, that to anyone's knowledge she has never thrown her phone at a personal assistant.</p> <p>And yet she makes people incredibly angry. \"Yeah. I have no idea why. I work really hard \u2013 I have seven appointments tomorrow before 10am. I'm constantly on the go. I have a successful clothing line. A fragrance. I mean, acting and singing aren't the only ways to be talented. It's a skill to get people to really like you for <em>you</em>, instead of a character written for you by somebody else.\"</p> <p>She is currently dating Kanye West, who might have had a hand in the following analogy. \"When rap music first started,\" Kardashian says, \"rappers were not respected and people thought it was just a fad. And people thought reality shows were going to come and go. They have taken over the soap operas. So it's a modern version of a soap opera.\"</p> <p>The difference, of course, is that the Kardashians are purporting to sell something real. For bald cheek, nothing matches a recent scene in the show in which Kardashian balked at attending a family therapy session because, she said, she didn't feel like sharing family secrets \"with a stranger\". Very occasionally, a genuine emotion is caught on camera and stands out in relief to the rest of the show \u2013 most recently during a staged discussion about Khlo\u00e9's paternity; while her mother and sisters mugged centre screen, Khlo\u00e9, to one side, looked fleetingly devastated.</p> <p>Despite all the phoniness, rehearsed dialogue and fake scenarios, however, there is some grain of authenticity to the Kardashians to which fans respond: when I asked teenagers at Dash why they liked the show, the most common reason was that, despite all the drama, \"they all really love each other and are such a close family\". Like&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0306370/\" title=\"\">the Osbournes</a> before them, the Kardashian family unit is convincingly tight. There is something unexpectedly soothing about this.</p> <p>For the record then, what is Kardashian's talent?</p> <p>\"What is my talent?\" She cocks her head to one side. \"Well, a bear can juggle and stand on a ball and he's talented, but he's not famous. Do you know what I mean?\"</p> <p>The mastermind behind the Kardashian empire is assumed to be Kris Jenner, mother, manager and ringmaster of her children's careers, who comes across on the show as a gimlet-eyed monster, wringing every last dollar from the family conceit. Despite her 100% belief in the reality genre, Kim Kardashian has to admit she is very glad she went through adolescence off-camera, unlike her youngest sisters, who were nine and 10 when the&#xa0;show started. (Their father is Bruce Jenner, the former Olympic athlete and Kris's second husband, whose career as a motivational speaker she reignited after marrying him. Her first husband, Robert Kardashian, who died in 2003, was OJ Simpson's lawyer.)</p> <p>\"I feel a little bit sad for my little sisters,\" Kardashian says. \"If there's one thing I'm so thankful I have, it's that privacy of pretty much my whole life until seven years ago.\"</p> <p>It was a spoilt childhood, materially \u2013 her father was a wealthy entrepreneur as well as a lawyer \u2013 and it's a mark of the milieu they grew up in that the Kardashian girls and their brother, Rob, were considered deprived because their parents wouldn't give them their own credit cards.</p> <p>But her dad bought them each a car, right?</p> <p>\"He gave us a car, but I had to sign a contract with him before I got it.\"</p> <p>The contract said she had to have it washed once a week; had to make sure it always had gas. \"And my grades had to be at a certain average to keep the car. If I crashed it, I had to be responsible for paying for it.\" She did crash it, within the first six months, and got a job to pay for the repairs.</p> <p>This was the beginning of Kardashian's career. She found work in a clothing store and liked it so much that, after paying off the car, she kept the job. She started to design her own accessories. \"I&#xa0;would make these headbands that were really popular and I'd sell them to all the fun stores in LA. I would make them after school and go around selling them.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396091175\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/4/1346773298176/Kanye-West-and-Kim-Kardas-008.jpg\" alt=\"Kanye West and Kim Kardashian\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kanye West and Kim Kardashian Photograph: Billy Farrell Agency/Rex Features</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Billy Farrell Agency/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She and her sisters periodically lived with their father at this point, their parents' marriage having disintegrated after Kris Jenner had an affair with a&#xa0;22-year-old. Fault lines in the family were, bizarrely, crystallised by the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/simpson\" title=\"\">OJ Simpson</a> trial. Kardashian's mother had been one of Nicole Brown Simpson's best friends and was supposed to have seen her on the day she was murdered; she believed OJ was guilty. Robert Kardashian was one of OJ's best friends and defended him.</p> <p>\"We were kids \u2013 14 and 15 years old, me and Kourtney,\" Kim says. \"We took my dad's side. Just because my dad was not married and my mum kind of broke his heart. It was personal. And&#xa0;we thought that my dad was the smartest man in the whole world. And if he thought he was &#xa0;innocent, we were going to be on that side.\"</p> <p>One day, their father came to them and said, \"Girls, this is a huge trial and is going to be a part&#xa0;of history, and I think you guys are old enough to handle it.\" They went into court with him and sat in the OJ camp. \"And my mum had gone with Bruce and she was sitting on the Brown&#xa0;side \u2013 on Nicole's side. And she turned around and gave as a <em>stare</em> like, I don't even want&#xa0;to see you guys when you get home. We wouldn't even look her way. She was so mad.\"</p> <p>This was the beginning of the family's life in the spotlight, although Kardashian had always wanted to be on TV. She watched the first MTV reality show, <a href=\"http://www.mtv.co.uk/shows/the-real-world\" title=\"\">The Real World</a>, and thought that's what she wanted to do.</p> <p>What, be on a reality show? \"Yes. I wasn't thinking fame. I was just thinking how cool.\" Why? \"I don't know; I just thought my life seemed interesting. I thought, if only people knew the crazy things that go on in this household, it would be so funny. And everyone kept saying that. They'd come over and be like, 'Oh my God, you need your own reality show.' I was always on board. Kourtney was the one who wasn't.\"</p> <p>Kim inched farther towards her goal when she started knocking around with Paris Hilton, and then, in 2003, she made a sex tape with her then boyfriend, the singer Ray J. The tape was eventually leaked and a star was born. (In a rare moment of coyness, Kris Jenner, in her memoir, glosses over this momentous turning point in the family history: \"There was so much media coverage swirling around Kim then, both positive and negative.\") Anyway, to \"take advantage of the moment\", Jenner made a pilot of the family and took it to Ryan Seacrest at US TV network E! Word came back that there were too many characters, too many siblings and that it was confusing. But Seacrest ultimately backed the show, correctly intuiting that, as with band members, young fans would be able to choose which of the three sisters was their favourite: blank but beautiful Kim, sweet Kourtney or sarcastic Khlo\u00e9. Meanwhile, Jenner's conniving entertained adults and, for comic relief, there was&#xa0;Bruce, bobbing around in the background, looking more startled with each season and new wave of plastic surgery.</p> <p>It's no small thing to keep a reality show afloat, and even Kardashian admits that by season four the family was getting panicky about content. \"I&#xa0;was like, 'You guys, I don't know that I have much more to give. I can only be myself, like\u2026 we're so boring now, we've shown everything.'\"</p> <p>And? \"And then Khlo\u00e9 got married, Kourtney got pregnant and everything else just happened&#xa0;organically.\"</p> <p>OK. So here's the thing: surely, living under that kind of pressure to feed the beast, one is tempted to say yes to things one might otherwise say no to, for example marrying Kris Humphries and then divorcing Kris Humphries. It doesn't even have to be mercenary; just a matter of needing to Make Something \u2013 Anything \u2013 Happen.</p> <p>\"Not really. We had done filming our season at that point, so we decided to film for the wedding. And that was a decision that he and I made together. But I think that, with any decisions in life [brace yourselves], like, I spoke to a girl today who had cancer and we were talking about how this is such a hard thing for her, but it taught her a big lesson on who her friends are and so much about life. She's 18. And I was like, that's how I feel.\"</p> <p>There is no ethical dimension to Kardashian's defence of her marriage, merely the rationale that it would have made bad commercial sense to have faked it. \"Getting married and divorced quickly, if that was my goal the whole time \u2013 I'm not an idiot, I obviously know that that would be a bad business decision. If anything, I probably would have left sooner had I not been filming, because I didn't want to end the relationship on TV.\" The sums of money she was said to have made are \"completely outrageous and not true\", she says. \"No, I mean even with the money we&#xa0;made, we still had to pay for the wedding. We &#xa0;didn't even make enough for that.\"</p> <p>So if you married again, would you sell the rights? \"I would definitely do it differently. Just all the scrutiny that I got. You don't plan to go through all of that willingly. For money.\" Her voice rises out of its Californian drawl and sounds&#xa0;momentarily urgent. \"That's just not what a sane person would do. So. Would I get married on TV again? No.\"</p> <p>She thinks about it for a moment. \"Well, I guess you never say never. Because who knows? So many other people I know have gotten married on TV and it has worked out amazing for them.\"</p> <p>There is a pause. \"William and Kate got married on TV,\" Kardashian says thoughtfully.</p> <p>Not all the endorsement deals have been successful. There was a debit card (\"the Kardashian Kard\") that had high hidden fees and from which, after a&#xa0;firestorm in the press, the family distanced themselves; and a diet product that is currently the subject of a lawsuit. Of the card, Kardashian says, \"definitely not the right deal for us. It sounded like a good idea when we went into it, but there were all these hidden fees and costs that even we didn't know about. Although, if you looked at it, it was still a lower percentage than the bank gives you on a credit card.\"</p> <p>(It's true that $10 a month fees for prepaid debit cards are not unusual, although there were other fees attached \u2013 $1.50 to ring the service centre for&#xa0;example \u2013 which looked, given the age of the target market, a little ungenerous.) In Kardashian world, attracting bad PR is a moral failing. \"For us, we just didn't want that negative press, so we backed off.\" As for QuickTrim, the diet product, \"If you look at every diet product, there's tons of lawsuits. So that is a successful product, actually.\"</p> <p>Kardashian has probably attracted more criticism for her decision to pose topless in Playboy and W magazines, something she hesitated over, but her mother talked her into. Good old Kris. Her&#xa0;father would have been horrified, Kardashian says. \"He would have killed me.\"</p> <p>But her mum? \"Oh, she was all for it.\"</p> <p>Doesn't she think it undermines her credibility as a business person? \"No, sex is powerful and I&#xa0;think it's empowering, so I don't. I would have thought that before, but now I don't. I go back and forth about it.\"</p> <p>The point is that men in her position would not&#xa0;be asked to pose naked. \"Yeah!\" she says with&#xa0;wonder, as if we have hit upon yet another feminist advantage in the world. \"I think it's empowering and I'll do what I want!\"</p> <p>She has at least been consistent in this. In her early 20s, long before the show, Kardashian was&#xa0;married to a musician called Damon Thomas,&#xa0;a fact she shared with her family only after the event. When I ask why she didn't tell her&#xa0;mother she was getting married, she has what looks like a rare, unstudied reaction. With a shuttered look, Kardashian says, \"Just a bad choice on my part.\"</p> <p>For months after the second marriage debacle, Kardashian says she stopped Googling herself, as near to a breakdown a member of that family can get. She changed her email address. She lost friends. \"All these people who were so on my side completely turned on me, and they're now trying to come back and be friends.\"</p> <p>Her pairing with Kanye West is odd; he so outspoken and political, Kardashian so neutral on&#xa0;almost everything. The first time she voted in her life was for Obama. \"I loved being part of that decision-making process, but I never voted in prior years when I was legally eligible. I don't know why.\" She is, she says, a \"liberal Republican\", put off Mitt Romney because of his stance against gay marriage. This election, she says, \"I don't know which way I'm going to go.\" Her favourite politician of all time is Kennedy.</p> <p>Kanye will appear intermittently in the next season of the show. They are taking their relationship \"season by season\". \"It's what we're both comfortable with, and it's all about making a&#xa0;group decision. Him and I, as a team.\"</p> <p>I imagine Kris Jenner might be in that decision, too. Won't the day come, I ask, when Kardashian rises up and overthrows her mother? She actually breaks out an annoyed facial expression. \"We are totally equal. She listens to what I say. She follows my lead. She works for me. I mean, on the&#xa0;show maybe it doesn't come off that way\u2026\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, another generation of Kardashians is emerging to fill the endless hours of scheduling. Kourtney's child Mason, a toddler, now takes up a good part of many episodes. Khlo\u00e9 and her husband Lamar have their own show, Khlo\u00e9 &amp; Lamar. The other day, Lamar went to the dentist. If Kardashian had a baby, she says, she would probably put it on&#xa0;TV, with certain caveats. For example, with Mason, \"he can come in and say, hi/bye, and that's it\", but isn't allowed to drive story lines.</p> <p>The point is, she has more perspective these days. The marriage crisis changed her. \"I'm leaning more towards being a little more private.\"</p> <p>So she might potentially say no to another season? Kardashian blinks. \"I never said I wouldn't do the family show.\" But it's very possible, she says, that the universe has shifted enough for her&#xa0;to say words she couldn't have imagined herself saying a year ago, an extraordinary break with Kardashian family values: \"I'll never do a&#xa0;spin-off.\"</p>",
  "<p>As a result of a wave of challenges to the 1965 Voting Rights Act, that seminal American law faces a likely review by the supreme court, whose conservative Republican majority is the most rightward-leaning in modern history. If the Voting Rights Act is toppled, other civil rights laws \u2013 including the 1964 Civil Rights Act \u2013 are in danger as well.</p> <p>Faced with recalcitrant state officials who prohibited blacks from voting, and federal laws that proved inadequate in stopping them, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act. Its purpose was to outlaw the discriminatory voting schemes that disenfranchised African Americans in the south and elsewhere. For example, section 2 of the legislation banned the use of literacy tests as a voting requirement. Meanwhile, section 5 required certain jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination to obtain federal approval for changes to its voting laws. The section applies to nine states and sections of seven other states. The act also allows the attorney general to challenge the use of poll taxes.</p> <p>Passage of the legislation was expedited by acts of racial violence in the south, including the murder of three civil rights workers in Philadelphia, Mississippi in 1964, and the brutal 1965 police attack on peaceful protesters marching across the Edmund Pettus Bridge on their journey from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama.</p> <p>Although the Voting Rights Act was passed by a Democratic-controlled Congress and signed by a Democratic president, most opposition came from southern Democratic lawmakers who had an interest in maintaining Jim Crow segregation and suppressing the political aspirations of African Americans. A larger majority of Republican lawmakers supported the act, as their party had supported \"full implementation and faithful execution\" of all civil rights statutes in its 1964 platform. After all, the \"Grand Old Party\" was once the party of the Radical Republicans, who had ushered in the civil rights amendments abolishing slavery, granting citizenship to blacks and allowing for black suffrage. In the post-civil war reconstruction era, the Republicans boasted some 2,000 black elected officials nationwide.</p> <p>In the late 1960s, however, the Republicans began employing a \"southern strategy\" to capitalize on white resentment of civil rights. A color-coded politics, perfected by the late GOP operative Lee Atwater, allowed taxes, big government and welfare to become proxies for the N-word. This led to the realignment of Dixie, with the Republican party controlling the former confederate states, and blacks eventually shifting their allegiance nearly exclusively to the Democrats.</p> <p>Moderate whites fled the party, as well. The more recent Tea Party takeover of the GOP \u2013 with the attendant hatred of a black president, Latino immigrants, civil rights and multicultural diversity \u2013 represents a natural consequence of that strategy. And the exclusively rightwing Republican fixation with voter fraud and voter ID reflects this new reality.</p> <p>Across the nation, 33 states have proposed laws restricting voting, including a requirement that citizens present a government-issued photo ID in order to vote. Spurred by conservative Republican legislators and their American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec), these laws are promoted under the pretext of combating voter fraud. Yet, voter fraud is exceedingly rare, with a 1 in 2.3m chance of occurring in a federal election, according to the NAACP. In a lawsuit challenging Pennsylvania's draconian voter ID law, lawyers representing the Republican-controlled commonwealth conceded there is no evidence voter fraud exists.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Mike Turzai, the Republican leader in the state House of Representatives, has proclaimed that voting restrictions will enable a Republican victory in the upcoming presidential election. \"Voter ID, which is gonna allow Governor Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania, done,\" he said. The states that have enacted such laws account for 78% of the electoral votes needed to elect the president, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.</p> <p>In Texas, where the state's discriminatory voter ID law was recently overturned by a federal appeals court, the state Republican party platform calls for a repeal of the Voting Rights Act. Supporters of repeal claim section 5 of the Act places an undue burden on some states and not others. And yet, the scourge of racially-motivated voter disenfranchisement legislation throughout the country, a potent example of Republican hubris and overreach, provides ample proof that the act is needed now more than ever.</p> <p>America is on the path to becoming a nation whose majority consists of people of color. The ongoing attack on civil rights, funded by the Koch Brothers and others, reflects a refusal by white conservatives to accept this new reality. Latinos are the fastest growing demographic group in the south, and African Americans are participating in a reverse migration to that region of the country. </p> <p>Given these circumstances, it is inevitable that red southern states will turn to blue, as Obama won North Carolina and Virginia in 2008. But amidst this demographic shift, the GOP is a nearly exclusively white party, with whites accounting for over 90% of the delegates at this year's convention in Tampa. The recent assault on a black CNN camerawoman by GOP convention attendees, and a recent poll showing zero percent black support for Mitt Romney, highlight the party's problem.</p> <p>The Jim Crow segregation laws denied black people their voting rights, told them who they could not marry and where they could not eat, sit or use the bathroom. This legal regime criminalized and dehumanized an entire group of people by promulgating laws that only applied to them, with penalties including imprisonment and death. These were what Martin Luther King Jr called unjust laws \u2013 \"a code that a numerical or power majority group compels a minority group to obey, but does not make binding on itself. This is difference made legal.\" The civil rights movement was an effort to eradicate unjust laws. And now, the Republican party is blatant in its efforts to undue the work of that movement by enacting unjust laws with a different name, but an identical purpose.</p> <p>In its 2012 platform, the Republican party endorses the voter ID laws, stating: \"Voter fraud is political poison. It strikes at the heart of representative government.\" But the real poison is the politically-inspired, extremist assault on civil rights in the US. And the real poisoners are those Republican lawmakers leading the charge.</p>",
  "<p>\"You didn't elect me to tell you what you wanted to hear,\" Barack Obama insisted to the Democratic faithful on Thursday, and yet the truth is that the phrases that carried him to the White House acquired much of their meaning in the ears of his audience. Four years ago, he could speak ringingly of \"hope\" and \"change you can believe in\", and leave it to the divided voters of the United States to attach disparate dreams on to these versatile slogans. Accepting his party's nomination for a second run at the job in Charlotte on Thursday was always going to be a more workaday task, and he turned in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/09/04/us/politics/democratic-convention-speeches-annotated.html\" title=\"\">a speech</a> which \u2013 by the standards of his more soaring oratory \u2013 was notably workmanlike.</p> <p>There were pledgecard-style promises for the doubling of small business exports and new manufacturing jobs, as well as gritty statistics about changes already wrought, such as the recent easing of America's addiction to imported oil. Some of the difference with 2008 is the familiar dulling of the poetry of the insurgent campaigner into the prose of a president with a record to defend. But some of it reflects the particular need of the hour \u2013 to demonstrate practical plans to ease the slow grind that day-to-day life has become ever since the Great Recession took hold. In a country whose social safety net is shot through with holes, hope will never be more than a slogan for the downtrodden until the labour market springs back to life. A few hours after Mr Obama's star turn, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19519037\" title=\"\">new figures</a> revealed that just 96,000 new jobs were created in August, 30,000 less than expected. Even without Europe's immediate crisis or Britain's self-administered austerity overdose, the US remains stuck with, in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/nov/08/after-crash-semi-slump\" title=\"\">Keynes's phrase,</a> the \"dragging conditions of semi-slump\".</p> <p>The unemployment rate edged down from 8.3% to 8.1%, but only because so many discouraged folk are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/richard-adams-blog/2012/sep/07/obama-convention-momentum-jobs-live\" title=\"\">giving up on looking for work</a>; it remains just the wrong side of the 8% threshold above which no postwar president has achieved a second term. The last one who did was Franklin Roosevelt in 1936. When he <a href=\"http://www.austincc.edu/lpatrick/his2341/fdr36acceptancespeech.htm\" title=\"\">spoke to the Democratic convention</a> of that year in Philadelphia he had, like Mr Obama, pulled the economy back from the worst depths, and sought to smooth the roughest social edges of hard economic times. But Roosevelt's energetic \"bold experimentation\" \u2013 which was hailed by the president on Thursday night \u2013 had certainly not yet restored anything like full employment. Just like Mr Obama, therefore, FDR had to make out the positive case for himself by first elucidating how much worse things could have been. He did so by declaring a great \"war against want and destitution\" and all those reactionaries who hankered for a return to \"government frozen in the ice of its own indifference\". He went on to win by a landslide.</p> <p>There is not now the deep-seated sense that there was in the 30s that the tide of history was running the progressive way; instead it is today American conservatives who often exude the most cocksure confidence. Indeed, despite the Republican party's want of answers to a crisis created under George W Bush, <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/156857/obama-wins-likability-romney-economy.aspx\" title=\"\">the polls</a> tend to give Mitt Romney the edge on the economy. Nor is it in the conciliatory nature of Mr Obama \u2013 a man who had once hoped for a post-partisan presidency \u2013 to close his speech, as Roosevelt did, by accepting a commission to take on the armies of reaction, for as long as the combat should rage. But after four years frustrated by unreasoning Republican intransigence at every turn, there were flashes of something close to fury. The president mocked a philosophy which for 30 years has offered one prescription for every ailment \u2013 \"Take two tax cuts, roll back some regulations, and call us in the morning.\"</p> <p>The tactics about swing states and surgical targeting of independently inclined demographics continues with yawnsome predictability. The underlying battle of economic ideas is, however, bubbling closer to the surface.</p>",
  "<p>The buzz was not allowed to last even a day. Less than 12 hours after Barack Obama had wrapped up his party's convention in Charlotte, the latest version of the number that could determine the fate of his presidency was published: <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Business/august-jobs-report-unemployment-falls-81-percent/story?id=17173284\" title=\"\">unemployment was down slightly, to 8.1%</a>, but the new jobs total was disappointingly below expectations.</p> <p>If that killed the Democrats' mood, Republicans could be forgiven for wondering if their convention last week in Tampa ever happened. The race appears to be pretty much where it was before, <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/us/general_election_romney_vs_obama-1171.html\" title=\"\">the latest poll of polls</a> showing Obama and Mitt Romney deadlocked on exactly 46.7% each, even if in the key states the president retains the advantage.</p> <p>So what will be left behind from this quadrennial ritual, a fortnight of back-to-back gatherings of America's two main political parties? We learned anew the curious paradox of Obama: that the man hailed as an orator of Ciceronian power four years ago is a poor communicator, at least when it comes to his own record. He has notched up significant achievements \u2013 averting a second depression, reviving a dying auto industry, passing the healthcare reform that eluded a century of predecessors, not to mention (though he does) Osama bin Laden \u2013 and yet he cannot seem to turn that scoresheet into a compelling narrative. His speech on Thursday <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/09/07/obama-a-pedestrian-and-overconfident-speech.html\" title=\"\">disappointed even sympathetic listeners</a>. Perhaps stung by the accusation that he offers flowery talk instead of action, he strove too hard to speak practically rather than soar.</p> <p>The best advocate for the Obama presidency turned out not to be Obama but Bill Clinton, <a href=\"http://marbury.typepad.com/marbury/2012/09/bill-kills.html\" title=\"\">who gave a masterclass</a> in how to dive into substantive, even nerdy, detail and still connect emotionally. It may be 16 years since he last raced competitively, but Clinton remains a world champion of politics.</p> <p>We learned too that the spouse's speech is now a central part of any presidential campaign: woe betide the candidate whose partner cannot address a full arena and TV audience of millions. Both Ann Romney and Michelle Obama did better than their husbands. If the latter chooses to follow the Hillary precedent, and a senate vacancy opens up in Illinois, she would walk it. She's a natural.</p> <p>All of this was watched by large numbers of Americans, of course. Incredibly, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/tv-column/post/giants-vs-cowboys-vs-clinton--too-soon-to-call/2012/09/06/94e8952a-f84b-11e1-8398-0327ab83ab91_blog.html\" title=\"\">more tuned in to see Bill Clinton</a>, a former president delivering a political speech, than to watch the season-opening Giants v Cowboys ballgame. But also paying attention were several British politicians. Tories among the Republicans included Sayeeda Warsi, Daniel Hannan MEP and the irrepressible Steve Hilton \u2013 along with, more surprisingly, Ed Miliband's righthand man, Stewart Wood. Wood went on to Charlotte where he was joined by David Miliband and Douglas Alexander. Flying the Tory flag among the Democrats was the American-born MP Tobias Ellwood.</p> <p>Given that such a large British contingent is probably not found at, say, a French or German party conference, it's worth asking what these UK politicos expected to learn. Take the Conservatives in Tampa. They might think of the Tories and Republicans as sister parties, but the gap between them is now surely so wide as to render most of what they saw inapplicable.</p> <p>Republicans express a loathing for the very idea of government more extreme, or at least more explicit, than anything you'd hear from a Tory. Cameron's Conservatives at least feel obliged to pay homage to the NHS, an idea condemned as socialist tyranny by any Republican who's heard of it. Cameroonian modernisation might seem a distant memory after this week's rightward reshuffle, but David Cameron's liberal stands on equal marriage or abortion ensure he would not survive a week in today's Republican party.</p> <p>So the transatlantic trade in political ideas is always going to be bumpy. Still, there are some items I assume those returning pols have stashed into their hand luggage. For Labour, item one is surely a DVD of the Clinton speech: Ed Miliband should sit down, pen in hand, right away to watch and learn.</p> <p>He would conclude, first, that a politician does not have to talk down to an audience. It is possible to talk seriously. Indeed, if you show the voters you respect them, they'll respect you. Second, it's wise to deal with the opposition's arguments, rather than hoping they'll go away. Clinton went through the Romney-Ryan chargesheet and tore it apart. Labour must do the same with the persistent claim that it cannot be trusted to run the economy because it overspent last time. It takes effort, but it's worth it.</p> <p>What's more, Clinton showed the power of arithmetic. He walked through the Republicans' numbers, exposing that their sums did not add up: you cannot cut taxes, spend more on defence and cut the deficit. Labour has to persist making the apparently counterintuitive case that austerity in a recession actually adds to, not reduces, the country's debts because it kills growth.</p> <p>Third, framing is all. Clinton is uniquely skilled at formulating an election in the terms that suit him and his party, all the while sounding fair and reasonable. This is not about phrase-making. The analysis comes first; the language follows. On Wednesday the former president framed the coming contest not as a referendum on Obama \u2013 which Obama would lose \u2013 nor as a question of whether Americans are better off&#xa0;now than four years ago, but as a choice between a \"winner-take-all society\" and one of \"shared prosperity and shared responsibility\".</p> <p>Labour has something to learn from the Republican convention too, but it's uncomfortable. Romney's troubles show that, even when faced with an incumbent mired in dreadful economic numbers, a challenger will struggle if he is seen to lack personal appeal. British politics is not yet presidential, but it has been heading in that direction for decades. Whatever other messages Labour projects, the voters have to see a party leader as a potential prime minister. That is a basic threshold to clear.</p> <p>But this cuts both ways. Ellwood and the others should report back to Cameron that if even the well-liked and ultra-charismatic Obama cannot surge ahead of an opponent as weak as Romney, it proves just how hard it is for incumbents to get re-elected in a recession. (Just ask Nicolas Sarkozy.) Candour should compel them to add that he cannot keep on doing things that alienate women \u2013 witness this week's demotion of female ministers. The Republicans, still reeling from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/20/todd-akin-legitimate-rape-romney\" title=\"\">Todd Akin's talk of \"legitimate rape\"</a>, have made that mistake repeatedly and are paying for it with a wide gender gap.</p> <p>Of course the two countries are different. But some things in politics are universal. In November we'll see the proof.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/j_freedland\" title=\"\"><em>@j_freedland</em></a></p>",
  "<p>Clint Eastwood has spoken for the first time in defence of his widely mocked address at the Republican national convention, stating that the \"unorthodox\" approach of chastising an empty chair went down well with delegates in the hall.</p> <p>In an interview with his local paper, the<a href=\"http://www.pineconearchive.com/120907-1.html\"> Carmel Pine Cone</a>, Eastwood admitted that the decision to use the prop \u2013 in which an invisible President Barack Obama was apparently seated, offering the odd inaudible profanity in response to actor's questioning \u2013 was a last minute addition to his star turn in Tampa.</p> <p>But despite a response which was largely negative, Eastwood maintains that it was well-received by Republican leaders as well as rank-and-file members.</p> <p>The audience were \"super enthusiastic\", the 82-year-old actor told the Pine Cone. And after the speeches had concluded, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and his running mate Paul Ryan both sought out Eastwood to thank him personally.</p> <p>\"They were very enthusiastic, and we were all laughing,\" Eastwood said.</p> <p>His account differs from that reportedly given by Romney's aides in the aftermath of the convention. The<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/01/us/politics/romney-aides-scratch-their-heads-over-eastwoods-speech.html\"> New York Times said \"baffled\" staffers were left pointing fingers at each other over</a> who authorised the shambling performance.</p> <p>During the actor's slot, an imaginary Obama was berated over the decision to go into Afghanistan, despite it being his predecessor George W Bush who sent troops into the conflict.</p> <p>Eastwood also alluded to imagined profanities uttered by the silent and invisible president. \"What do you want me to tell Romney?\" he asked the empty chair, adding: \"I can't tell him that. He can't do that to himself.\"</p> <p>The crowd laughed, but many others around the country cringed. In the Carmel Pine Cone interview, Eastwood said the address had not been vetted by Republican Party officials, and that the use of a chair was a late addition by the actor himself.</p> <p>\"There was a stool there, and some fella kept asking me if I wanted to sit down,\" he told the paper in Carmel, the California town where he served as mayor in the 1980s.</p> <p>\"When I saw the stool sitting there, it gave me the idea. I'll just put the stool out there and I'll talk to Mr Obama and ask him why he didn't keep all of the promises he made to everybody.\"</p> <p>Eastwood admitted the move was \"very unorthodox\", but explained that he wasn't much of a public speaker. \"I was a mayor, and they're probably thinking I know how to give a speech, but even when I was a mayor I never gave speeches. I gave talks,\" he said.</p> <p>As to any criticism resulting from the bizarre convention turn, Eastwood dismissed it as coming \"obviously from the left\".</p> <p>He also took the opportunity to sharpen his attack on Obama, describing the president as \"the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people\".</p> <p>Eastwood added: \"Romney and Ryan would do much better job running the country, and that's what everybody needs to know. I may have irritated a lot of lefties, but I was aiming for people in the middle.\"</p>",
  "<p>It might not be long until Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's presidential term comes to an end but he doesn't seem to believe it will finally happen. During a <a href=\"http://www.lenziran.com/2012/09/ahmadinejad-live-on-tv-how-do-you-know-that-the-life-of-governement-is-over-in-one-year/\">recent interview</a> on state television in which a journalist mentioned that his presidency would finish within a year, the president interjected, laughing: \"How do you know?\"</p> <p>Under Iranian law Ahmadinejad cannot run for a third term, and on Friday officials announced the next election would be held on 14 June 2013. The last was in 2009 when Ahmadinejad took office for a second term amid allegations of fraud and unrest. </p> <p>The president's joking response prompted speculation that he planned to preserve his dwindling power by grooming someone in his inner circle as his possible successor. Ahmadinejad's opponents pointed the finger at his close confidant and chief of staff, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/21/ahmadinejad-iran-successor-wikileaks\">Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei</a>, as a likely candidate. </p> <p>Mohammad Dehghan, who sits on the parliament's executive board, criticised Ahmadinejad and accused him of pursuing a Putin/Medvedev-style reshuffle. </p> <p>\"Ahmadinejad should know that Iran is not Russia and he is not Putin. Ahmadinejad's Medvedev [a reference to Mashaei] has no position among the public opinion and he will not have any position in future,\" he said, according to the semi-official Mehr news agency. The president's office <a href=\"http://www.mehrnews.com/en/newsdetail.aspx?NewsID=1690208\">denied</a> suggestions that Mashaei would put his name forward for the presidency. </p> <p>Mashaei fell foul of conservatives after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/may/19/ahmadinejad-iran-power-struggle\">a power struggle last year</a> between supporters of Ahmadinejad and those close to the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Khamenei's supporters believe that the confrontation stemmed from the increasing influence of Mashaei, an opponent of greater involvement of clerics in politics, whom they described as the head of a \"deviant current\" within the president's inner circle.</p> <p>Speculation is rife about who will be Ahmadinejad's successor. Tehran's mayor, Mohammad-Bagher Ghalibaf, is one name often mentioned. Another is Saeed Jalili, the chief nuclear negotiator and a close ally of Khamenei. Many also tip Ali Larijani, the parliamentary speaker. </p> <p>One thing is clear: whoever takes the mandate, it will not be Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.</p>",
  "<p>After the party, the hangover. Just eight hours after Barack Obama made his case for another term in the White House, received with such fervor from the 20,000 Democratic supporters assembled in front of him that it brought back memories of the euphoria of 2008, the latest job figures landed with a thump.</p> <p>\"I won't pretend the path I'm offering is quick or easy; I never have,\" Obama told the packed arena in Charlotte. The job figures made the same point even more eloquently: fewer than 100,000 jobs created in August when twice as many were needed; jobless rate down to 8.1% but mainly because many Americans have given up the search for work.</p> <p>If Obama hadn't had an early sighting of the job figures, as some pundits suspected, then he certainly pitched his speech on the assumption they might be bad. It was designed, in its language and theatrics, to be the antidote to the paean to hope and change that a bushy-tailed Obama delivered four years ago. \"I was a younger man\" then, Obama said almost wistfully.</p> <p>There was no Greek temple this time, no rallying cry of the \"fierce urgency of now\", and though he talked about hope he did so apologetically, lamenting that hope had been tested \"by one of the worst economic crises in history\". He went so far as to say he was \"mindful of my own failings\" \u2013 a stunning admittance from a man <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/03/us/politics/obama-plays-to-win-in-politics-and-everything-else.html?src=twr\">famously assured of his own abilities</a>.</p> <p>None of that seemed to matter for the faithful in the arena, though, who cheered and chanted as though it were early 2008 all over again and the great recession still lay ahead. Even the thousands of supporters who were turned away from the arena after the larger stadium event was cancelled refused to be dampened by disappointment: they screamed at Obama as he was beamed onto screens in front of them in the spill-over ballroom into which they had been relegated.</p> <p>Conventions are a form of theatre, and in purely thespian terms Obama won the battle hands down. His performance on Thursday night resonated with committed Democrats on a level that Mitt Romney could only dream of. Republican delegates assembled in Tampa the previous week were notably muted by comparison.</p> <p>This was partly a simple reflection of the audience itself: hardcore Democrats remain far more enamoured of Obama than the conservative base is of Romney. And Obama had a Tony award-winning supporting cast in Michelle, who played the emoting wife more convincingly than her first lady challenger Ann Romney, and Bill Clinton, who once again proved himself to be the Laurence Olivier of political soliloquizing.</p> <p>But running for the presidency is not just about stagecraft, even in the era of the TV soundbite. Outside the bubble of the convention centers in Charlotte and Tampa, away from the auto-cues and the flag waving, there are millions of Americans out of work and millions more anxious that they could lose their jobs.</p> <p>Which is why, for all the razmattazz and barnstorming inside the arena, outside it the 2012 election remains an ugly affair, fought through teeth and nail and certain to be agonisingly close to the bitter end. The latest polls put <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2012/09/04/poll-shows-romney-obama-matchup-largely-unchanged-after-gop-convention/ \">the two candidates as essentially tied</a> at around 48%.</p> <p>Delegates from the key battleground states where the election will be won or lost \u2013 Colorado, Iowa, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio and Virginia \u2013 are fully aware that the made-for-camera stardust of the conventions has nothing to do with the real-life struggles they are fighting on the ground. </p> <p>Every morning this week Democratic volunteers from each of the 50 states have been coming together in their own gatherings to discuss not high-falutin political rhetoric or the ubiquitous convention lip service paid to the American dream, but the brass tacks of how to win on 6 November.</p> <p>Take the breakfast held at 7.30am by the Ohio delegation in a hotel room 10 miles outside Charlotte. The coffee was bitter, the bacon burnt and the eggs cooked to the consistency of a bouncy ball, but the conversation was serious and the atmosphere dour and determined.</p> <p>\"It's close, very very close,\" one delegate replied when asked about how the race looked in Ohio. The buckeye state is shaping up to be in 2012, as it has in so many previous presidential races, the quintessential swing state upon which the entire election could hang.</p> <p>Its economy is doing rather better than the national average \u2013 at about 7.2% \u2013 thanks in part to the Obama administration's rescue package for the car industry. Against that, voters have been pummelled now for months with a blitzkrieg of negative attack advertising paid for by billionaire conservatives and their controversial Super Pacs.</p> <p>There is so much noise from the election blaring at them from their TV and computer screens that many voters have already switched off. Delegates who I talked to feared that a feeling of a pox on both your houses was setting in that could suppress turn out in November and make it difficult for either party to drive home its message.</p> <p>So the picture from Ohio looks very different from the scenes of happy Democratic party activists streaming out of the arena on Thursday night. As they started on their long drives home to Akron or Denver, Las Vegas or Des Moines they looked as though they had received a shot in the arm, that Obama's rousing words had pumped them full of energy.</p> <p>Which is just as well. As the race enters its final 60 days, they are going to need all the muscle power they can muster.</p>",
  "<p>There is a famous Monty Python sketch called \"Four Yorkshiremen\".

According to their own stories, speaker after speaker detailed their family's rise from poverty to success in the space of a generation or two. In order to praise the powerful myth of the American Dream, both Republicans and Democrats battled to outdo each other with origin stories of deprived woe.</p> <p>Here, for example, is <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/80348.html\">Rick Santorum, praising the memory of his Italian immigrant coal-mining grandfather</a>. \"My grandfather mined coal until he was 72 years old \u2026 working the mines may not have been the dream he dreamed \u2013 I never dared to ask him \u2013 but I think his answer would have been that America gave him more than he had ever hoped,\" Santorum opined, though surely anyone would hope for more than working in a coal pit until well past 70.</p> <p>But that was just for starters. <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/80413.html\">Former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty could top that</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"My dad was a truck driver.

He arrived in Pittsburgh as a teenager with nothing, not a penny,\" he said. Even \u2013 staggeringly \u2013 super-rich Mitt Romney <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/08/30/transcript-mitt-romney-speech-at-rnc/\">joined in</a>. \"My dad had been born in Mexico and his family had to leave during the Mexican revolution,\" Mitt said. \"I grew up with stories of his family being fed by the US government as war refugees.\"</p> <p>Make no mistake, though, this posturing was a thoroughly bipartisan affair. <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/09/04/160574895/transcript-julian-castros-dnc-keynote-address\">Here is new Democratic Hispanic leader Julian Castro, the mayor of San Antonio</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"My grandmother was an orphan \u2026 She never made it past the fourth grade. She had to drop out and start working to help her family. My grandmother spent her whole life working as a maid, a cook and a babysitter, barely scraping by.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Or <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0912/80673.html\">listen to Illinois congressional candidate Tammy Duckworth</a>. \"Mom took in sewing. My 55-year-old dad tried to find work. But at 15, I was the only one with a job \u2013 after school, for minimum wage. Thank God for the food stamps,\" she told the Charlotte gathering. </p> <p>From the famous to the unknown, everyone got in on the act. <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/videos/2012/09/06/scarlett-johansson-addresses-dnc.html\">Hollywood star Scarlett Johansson was not to be denied</a>. \"My father barely made enough to get by. We moved every year, and we finally settled in a housing development for lower middle-income families,\" she said, though that hardly sounds too Dickensian. But <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/09/04/160578836/transcript-michelle-obamas-convention-speech\">Michelle Obama could make up for that</a>. \"My father was a pump operator at the city water plant, and he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis when my brother and I were young,\" she reminisced. </p> <p>It is important to say there is no doubt these stories are true. They are also moving, showing the brave struggles and sacrifices that one generation can make for another, or the sheer obstacles that some individuals have overcome to achieve high office. But in the context of the propaganda jamborees that are modern conventions, they are being used to make a political point: the American Dream came true for me and it can for you, too. Increasingly, however, evidence for the truth of that sentiment is seriously wanting. </p> <p>Despite the heartwarming tales emerging from both sides of the political aisle, social mobility in America is under serious threat. In many ways, if you are to be born poor, you would be better-off being born somewhere else in the developed world than in the United States of America. Your chances of improving your social lot are likely to be better. As <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/howard-steven-friedman/class-mobility_b_1676931.html\">Columbia University Professor Howard Steven Friedman writes, about the work of the Economic Mobility Project</a>, the prospects of bettering oneself in the US can be worse than in many other developed countries, even class-ridden Britain. Friedman points out that an American male's income is nearly twice as reliant on his father's background as a Canadian's. Another study showed some 42% of American sons of fathers born in the poorest fifth of society ended up in that fifth themselves. That compares to <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/howard-steven-friedman/class-mobility_b_1676931.html\">30% in the UK, and a range of 25-28% in Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Norway</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/05/us/harder-for-americans-to-rise-from-lower-rungs.html?pagewanted=all\">A separate report</a>, by University of Ottawa Professor Miles Corak in 2006, reviewed 50 mobility studies of nine countries. He, too, ranked the Scandinavian nations and Canada as the most likely to be socially mobile, with the US and the UK bringing up the rear. But just in case you had any doubts, the Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz has also got in on the argument. In his recent book, The Price of Inequality, <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/daily-ticker/american-dream-myth-joseph-stiglitz-price-inequality-124338674.html\">he writes that America's growing gap between the rich and the rest of us has decreased social mobility</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"America has the least equality of opportunity of any of the advanced industrial economies.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Many believe the nub of America's problem is with the very poor, skewing the figures for the country as a whole. As <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/the-american-dream-is-now-a-myth-2012-6\">the first graph in this Business Insider story shows</a> the real difference between a socially mobile country, like Denmark, and a less mobile one like the US <em>is</em> with the bottom fifth of society. Elsewhere on the spectrum, countries are much more comparable. Which makes the \"poverty arm's race\" on display in Tampa and Charlotte all the more misleading: if you are really born on the \"wrong side of the tracks\" in today's America, you are much more likely to stay there than end up testifying to a national convention about your remarkable rise out of deprivation.</p> <p>As America's politicians outdid each other to try and show how far they had come, the reality on the ground now is making those journeys longer and far more difficult. Unlike the Monty Python sketch, that is not funny.</p>",
  "<p>European Central Bank president Mario Draghi's rescue plan for the eurozone brought cheer to financial markets for a second day, while pressure built on Portugal, which has announced further austerity measures.</p> <p>The Italian stock market added 2.1%, Germany's Dax closed up 0.7% and Spain's Ibex, France's CAC and the FTSE&#xa0;100 in London all finished the day 0.3% higher after \"Super Mario's\" ambitious plan announced on Thursday to keep the eurozone together by sanctioning \"unlimited\" bond buying by the ECB. Asian markets also rallied, with Japan's Nikkei index posting a gain of 2.2%, its biggest gain in five months.</p> <p>The euro rose against the dollar, climbing near the $1.28 level for the first time in three months.</p> <p>Spanish and Italian borrowing costs declined sharply, with the yield, or effective interest rate, on Spanish 10-year debt dropping 0.4 percentage points to 5.6% \u2013 the first time it has been below 6% since May. Six weeks ago it surged to 7.6%, deep in the danger zone where borrowing costs become unsustainable, and at the start of this week it was still about 7%.</p> <p>The Italian equivalent fell a quarter of a point to 5%; in late July, before Draghi's commitment to \"do whatever it takes\" to preserve the euro, it had been 6.75%.</p> <p>The cost of insuring Spanish debt also fell. The 10-year Portuguese yield was down 0.4 points to its lowest level since March 2011. Although as high as 8.1%, that compared with 18% in February.</p> <p>The Dow Jones industrial average hovered between gain and loss after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/07/obama-jobs-figures-us-election-chances\" title=\"\">the labour department said the US had added just 96,000 new jobs in August</a>, far below expectations. The Dow had hit its highest level since December 2007 on Thursday, but the jobs report focused investors on the US's own problems.</p> <p>The pound got a fillip from the weak US jobs data, climbing to above $1.60 for the first time since mid-May. Surprisingly strong industrial production data also brought some cheer to Britain. Factory production in Germany was stronger than expected, rising by 1.3% in July.</p> <p>The Federal Reserve meets next week and economists speculated that the poor jobs figures will add further pressure on the central bank to act.</p> <p>Chairman Ben Bernanke indicated in a speech last week that he was concerned about the slowing pace of the US recovery and the still high unemployment rate.</p> <p>The Portuguese prime minister, Pedro Passos Coelho, set out fresh austerity measures on Friday night in a televised address billed as a \"declaration to the country\", saying he could not allow slippage on the bailout plan and announcing next year's budget will raise social security contributions for all workers from 11% to 18%.</p> <p>Spain gave no hints as to when it might make a formal bailout request to trigger the bond-buying programme. Deputy prime minister Soraya S\u00e1enz de Santamar\u00eda said the plan would be discussed at next week's meeting of European finance and economy ministers in Cyprus.</p> <p>\"While markets are currently happy that the ECB's bond purchase scheme stands ready to be activated, getting the Spanish and Italian governments to agree to programmes is likely to be fraught with difficulties,\" said Grant Lewis at Daiwa Capital Markets. \"Indeed, the positive market reaction makes their activation less likely by taking the pressure off the Spanish and Italian governments. So it may well require a significant deterioration in market sentiment once again to ultimately trigger the programmes that lead to ECB purchases.\"</p> <p>German chancellor Angela Merkel backed the ECB over the creation of the bond-buying programme, and said it was right to insist on conditions in return for assistance provided through the scheme. The Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, refused to back the plan, and it did not go down well in parts of the German media. Top-selling tabloid Bild led the way, warning that the ECB's \"blank cheque\" could make the euro \"kaputt\".</p> <p>Handelsblatt criticised \"the democratic deficit of the euro rescuers\" and linked the ECB's latest action to next Wednesday's ruling by Germany's constitutional court on the legality of the eurozone's new bailout mechanism and budget rules.</p> <p>This is another crunch day in the euro \u2013 a rejection of the European stability mechanism (ESM) and the fiscal pact would plunge the eurozone into fresh turmoil.</p> <p>A Reuters poll of 20 top lawyers found unanimous agreement that the court will throw out the request for a temporary injunction to halt the ESM and the pact.</p> <p>However, 12 of those questioned also expect the court to insist that German liability has to be limited.</p>",
  "<p>The Democratic party's euphoria at the close of its party convention in Charlotte evaporated within hours when the US government published a dismal set of unemployment figures that threatened Barack Obama's re-election chances.</p> <p>Obama had fired up the party faithful with a speech that pleaded for a second term but recognised that economic recovery would be slow. \"I won't pretend the path I'm offering is quick or easy,\" he said.</p> <p>But on Friday morning, the department of labor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/07/us-adds-only-96k-jobs-august\">revealed that the US economy had added only 96,000 jobs in August</a>, well below expectations. The figures undermined the president's oft-repeated argument that his policies, while slow to bring results, are on the right track.</p> <p>The Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney declared the figures to be an indictment of Obama's economic policies. \"If last night was the party, this morning is the hangover. For every net new job created, nearly four Americans gave up looking for work entirely,\" Romney said.</p> <p>The White House response to the unemployment figures was muted, saying the economy is continuing to recover but more work remained to be done.</p> <p>Republicans are banking on the sluggish economy to take them to the White House. There are two more sets of unemployment figures still to be published, the last just four days before the election on 6 November. No US president since the Great Depression has won re-election with unemployment so high.</p> <p>Democrats had been buoyed by their three-day convention, dominated by an inspired speech from Bill Clinton on Wednesday night and Obama's more pragmatic address late on Thursday night.</p> <p>But the jobs figures cast a pall over the celebrations. Although the headline figures showed a drop from 8.3% to 8.1% the fall was mainly attributed to people giving up the search for work. Only 96,000 new jobs were created in August compared with 141,000 in July \u2013 well below the rate of population growth. Pressure is building on the Federal Reserve, when it meets on 12 September, to intervene to stimulate the economy.</p> <p>With the conventions over, the election campaign now begins in earnest and voters beginning to pay attention. Obama, within hours of his convention speech in which he formally accepted the party's nomination to fight the election, headed off early Friday morning on a punishing campaign schedule that took in Iowa and New Hampshire and a two-day bus trip across Florida beginning Saturday.</p> <p>The Obama campaign teams admits the election is going to be close. Polls have shown Obama and Romney almost neck-and-neck for months. A Reuters/Ipsos poll on Thursday put Romney on 45% to Obama's 44%.</p> <p>Over the next two weeks, with voters more fully engaged in the campaigns, the coming polls will provide the first genuine indication of who is likely to win the White House.</p> <p>The Obama campaign team and supporting groups splurged on ads over the summer, spending an estimated $120m mainly negative campaigns portraying Romney as rich, uncaring and out-of-touch.</p> <p>But now it is the turn of the Romney campaign to spend big, releasing on Friday 15 new television ads in eight battleground states. Over the next two months, the Romney campaign, backed by Super Pacs \u2013 political action committees formed by small groups of mainly wealthy supporters \u2013 is expected to outspend Obama by two to one.</p> <p>The Democrats nevertheless had the better of the conventions. The Republican event in Tampa, Florida, was disrupted by hurricane Isaac and there was a palpable lack of enthusiasm for Romney as the GOP's presidential candidate. The delegates were overwhelmingly white and generally older.</p> <p>The Democratic convention was also disrupted by weather. Obama's speech had to be moved from a 73,000-seater football stadium to a 23,000-seater smaller arena, leaving disappointed ticket-holders, mainly party volunteers, to line up for seats at a screening in the nearby convention centre. The thunderstorms that party officials had cited as the reason for the venue change failed to materialise. Republicans claimed it was moved because Obama would not be able to fill the stadium and feared television images of empty seats.</p> <p>But the Democratic convention had more energy, with a party atmosphere in Charlotte. The delegates were more representative of America, much more diverse than the Republicans in terms of ethnic background, with more young people and a 50-50 split between men and women.</p> <p>After Clinton's barnstormer on Wednesday, Obama struck a more low-key approach on Thursday, his tone more subdued compared with the sense of euphoria he created at the Denver convention four years ago.</p> <p>The more sober approach was deliberate, a recognition of the mood of disenchantment among some voters, tired of fine oratory and more interested in his plans for a second term.</p> <p>Obama hinted that he would, if re-elected, embark on a bold and ambitious Franklin Roosevelt-style New Deal programme, but offered few details.</p> <p>Instead, he called for patience.\"You didn't elect me to tell you what you wanted to hear. You elected me to tell you the truth. And the truth is it will take more than a few years for us to solve challenges that have built up over decades,\" he said.</p> <p>Obama was careful to recognise his own shortcomings, at one point telling the crowd that one of the differences from 2008 was that he was \"far more mindful of my own failings, knowing exactly what Lincoln meant when he said: 'I have been driven to my knees many times by the overwhelming conviction that I had no place else to go.'\"</p> <p>Among Obama supporters leaving the arena after the speech, Sandy Blakney, 54, a psychiatrist from the Raleigh area of North Carolina, said she understood why Obama had adopted a low-key approach.</p> <p>\"He did a little bit of the soaring rhetoric but in general his tone was a little more subdued, a little bit more serious,\" she said. This reflected the gravity of the economic crisis he faced on taking office.</p> <p>She added another reason. \"He does not want people to think he has become over-confident.\"</p>",

  "<p>For the first 30 or so minutes of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/07/barack-obama-pleads-voters-finish\">President Obama's convention closer</a>, there was an unwelcome guest in the room: the memory of other speeches. Since his election, Obama has necessarily leavened his speeches with policy specifics and gestures at compromise. His most universally-applauded remarks have been those given when everyone wants to be uplifted. His speech at the Democratic convention on Thursday was one of the first chances in a long while to get the positive attention of a national audience that would not come in the wake of a tragedy \u2013 though Republicans might argue differently.</p> <p>Given that context, the specificity and pragmatism of his speech's first two-thirds was disappointingly reminiscent of his state of the union addresses, not the fiery performances of the previous campaign. Long on numbers, short on heart, missing poetry and settling for facts. At the very end, however, Obama stirred. He raised his voice and his vision. The invisible Obama who had haunted both parties' halls finally showed up. Mostly, he did not have to remind us there was an election going on \u2013 until he announced, \"We face a choice.\" (Generous, that \"we\".)</p> <p>Obama clearly wants to appear like the bigger man when it comes to campaign tactics \u2013 he talks a lot about how politics has gotten \"small\" \u2013 but his jabs at Romney over a mischaracterization of Russia's importance and Romney's foreign gaffe-a-looza were as close to an adolescent eyeroll as a president can get without being on Twitter. (Hashtag: #facepalm.) That short, snarky interlude was the only part to bear a recognizable resemblance to the campaign the parties will spring onto mostly unsuspecting Americans in a matter of days. Or sooner: within hours of Obama's speech ending, the Romney campaign announced a $4.5m ad buy, consisting of 15 separate ads, to run in eight swing states.</p> <p>And I'll give the Republicans this: their convention, while not representative in terms of national demographics, or even verifiable reality, very much reflected the direction of the campaign we'll see in the fall. Romney will not be so much running for the presidency as gunning for it, taking it on as a position to be attacked and occupied. Pundits talked about his convention speech being his introduction to American voters, but it was really a list of grievances. He mentioned Obama by name 15 times \u2013 as many times as he mentioned \"jobs\". And you know how much he likes eliminating jobs.</p> <p>Obama never mentioned Romney by name \u2013 he was merely the nameless and, by implication, unworthy \"opponent\". The entire convention, from the speeches inside to the vendors outside, treated Romney as an amusing afterthought. He was represented by a Cheshire Cat smirk.</p> <p>But a presidential race can't be run by <em>two</em> invisible men. In each case, convention-goers celebrated their candidate more than they denigrated the other guy, but then again, they have already made up their minds \u2013 though one might argue that Republican convention-goers still had to be convinced. Beyond Tampa and Charlotte and in the public arena, however, the Democratic argument will be almost indistinguishable from the one Republicans made more explicitly: <em>not the other guy!</em></p> <p>Forget this week's Charlotte love-in and look at the rhetorical record of campaign ads. Obama and his Super Pac have hammered Romney on his taxes, his relationship to the far right, his business background and his singing. They aren't just defining Romney, they're demolishing him. That many of the attacks have, at least, some more direct relationship to facts than a typical Paul Ryan speech is important, but does not elevate their tone. </p> <p>On Fox News shortly after Obama wrapped up, Karl Rove summed up the Obama campaign's approach:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You create a false image of who you're running against and then smash it down.</p> </blockquote> <p>Well, he would know. Going after your opponent's purported greatest strength \u2013 in Romney's case, his business experience \u2013 is Rovian Strategy 101. This year's Obama campaign looks a lot more like one Rove would run than it does like \"hope\".</p> <p>With both parties shouting \"<em>not him</em>\" in the ears of voters, it's no wonder that many are worried turnout will dip not just below the last cycle's record high, but down to a record low. A contest between two effective arguments against the other guy can only end up with voters agreeing all around.</p> <p>If either candidate has a chance at raising the tone of this election, it's Obama. He's the only one who has done it in the past. I don't question that he wants to. But I think he wants even more just to win.</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 Perhaps the oddest thing about the convention was that John Kerry's adventures in standup comedy weren't an excruciating disaster. \"Talk about being for it before you were against it!\" he said of Mitt Romney's positions on Iraq, a self-deprecating reference to his own reputation as a flip-flopper. (Not that everyone got the joke: \"Kerry slams Romney for flip-flopping. Oh the irony,\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NRO/status/243876498250018818\">tweeted the conservative National Review</a>, ever the dinner guest who prompts everyone else to study their plates in embarrassment.)</p> <p>Kerry also teased Sarah Palin for her incoherence on foreign policy \u2013 provoking <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/palin-surprised-kerry-knows-her-name\">Palin, speaking on Fox Business Network, to emit the following sequence of words</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I mean aren't these guys supposed to be these bigwig elites who don't waste their time on the little people like me, me representing the average American who yeah I did say in Alaska you can see Russia from our land base and I was making the point that we are strategically located on the globe and when it comes to transportation corridors and resources that are shared and fought over, Alaska and I as the governor, had known what I was doing in dealing with some international issues that had to do with our resources that could help secure the nation.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Just so we're clear on that.</p> <p>\u2022 A late-night convention <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/stacylambe/lindsay-lohans-message-to-potus-on-taxes\">tweet from Lindsay Lohan</a>, spotted by Buzzfeed, in response to Obama pointing out that he's cut taxes for middle-class families and small businesses: \"@BarackObama we also need to cut them for those that are listed on Forbes as 'millionaires' if they are not, you must consider that as well.\" <a href=\"http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-01-10/news/30613353_1_steve-honig-income-taxes-tax-bill\">According to reports this year in the US media</a>, Lohan \"forgot\" to pay her income tax in 2009, prompting a huge bill \u2013 along with the threat of property seizure \u2013 from the Internal Revenue Service. Might these two things be connected?</p> <p>\u2022 Another success: Joe Biden got through his rousing speech with only one quasi-gaffe, providing you don't count his use of the word \"literally\" to mean \"figuratively\", which <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/gavon/joe-biden-literally-says-literally-a-lot\">he did literally trillions of times</a>.</p> <p>\"My dad respected Barack Obama,\" <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/biden-my-dad-respected-barack-obama-wouldve-respected-barack-obama-if-hed-been-around_651900.html\">he told the cheering crowds</a>, before remembering that Joseph Biden Sr had passed away while Obama was still a law professor and low-profile state senator in Illinois. \"<em>Would've</em> respected Barack Obama, if he'd been around,\" Biden corrected himself.</p> <p>In other Biden news, the <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2012/09/05/biden-in-a-word-good-idiot/\">Pew Research Centre asked 1,008 people</a> what one word best describes the vice-president, and the results show an America starkly divided. The most popular word was \"good\" (43 people) followed closely by \"idiot\" (40), then \"OK\" (21), with the unimaginative literalists (\"vice-president\") in fourth place at 20. After that, in descending order: honest, incompetent, old, stupid, clown. Politics: it's literally a pretty harsh business.</p> <p>\u2022 Amid the partisanship, a rare moment of agreement on the question of which host city handled its convention best. <a href=\"http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2012/09/07/3510044/charlotte-vs-tampa-howd-we-do.html\">According to the Charlotte Observer</a>, it was Charlotte: no surprise there. But what about the mayor of Tampa, Bob Buckhorn? As a Democratic delegate, he preferred the livelier atmosphere of Charlotte's downtown, too, the paper reported.</p> <p>All right, that's the non-partisanship over with. Are you ready for a bitter, dishonest, maliciously negative, intelligence-insulting general election campaign? Actually, it doesn't matter whether you're ready for it. Here it comes.</p>",
  "<p><em>[Updated below - Update II]</em></p> <p>One of the formative events shaping my views of the last decade's American political landscape was watching the 2004 Republican national convention. An expertly staged, supremely manipulative ritual of jingoism and leader-worship, I regarded it with an equal measure of awe and horror. </p> <p>America's militarism was continuously exploited by speaker after speaker to glorify the commander-in-chief, George W Bush, as a brave and noble warrior for American Greatness. Each mention of war and killing prompted his delirious followers to erupt in the same boisterous crowd-chant: \"USA, USA.\" Bush's opponent (and his supporters), by contrast, were vilified as soft-on-the-terrorists, troop-hating, America-despising weaklings who lacked the stomach to Keep Us Safe.</p> <p>Typifying all of this was <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A54299-2004Sep1.html\">Dick Cheney's vice-presidential acceptance speech</a>: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"As in other times, we are in a war we did not start, and have no choice but to win. </p> <p>(APPLAUSE)</p> <p>\"Firm in our resolve, focused on our mission, and led by a superb commander-in-chief, we will prevail.</p> <p>(APPLAUSE)</p> <p>\"The fanatics who killed some 3,000 of our fellow Americans may have thought they could attack us with impunity, because terrorists had done so previously.</p> <p>\"But if the killers of September 11 thought we had lost the will to defend our freedom, they did not know America, and they did not know George W Bush.</p> <p>(APPLAUSE)</p> <p>\"From the beginning, the president made clear that the terrorists would be dealt with and that anyone who supports, protects or harbors them would be held to account. </p> <p>(APPLAUSE)</p> <p>\"President Bush does not deal in empty threats and half measures. And his determination has sent a clear message \u2026</p> <p>\"Even in this post 9/11 period, Senator Kerry doesn't appear to understand how the world has changed. He talks about leading a 'more sensitive war on terror' \u2026</p> <p>(LAUGHTER)</p> <p>\" \u2026 as though al-Qaida will be impressed with our softer side.</p> <p>(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)</p> <p>\"He declared at the Democratic convention that he will forcefully defend America after we have been attacked. My fellow Americans, we have already been attacked \u2026\"</p> <p>(APPLAUSE)</p> <p>[AUDIENCE:] \"USA. USA. USA.\"</p> <p>[CHENEY:] \"But as the President has made very clear, there is a difference between leading a coalition of many nations and submitting to the objections of a few. </p> <p>(APPLAUSE)</p> <p>\"George W Bush will never seek a permission slip to defend the American people.\"</p> <p>(APPLAUSE)</p> <p>[AUDIENCE:] \"USA. USA. USA.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>It went on and on like that, speaker after speaker. The same chant erupted when Bush, in <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57466-2004Sep2.html\">his acceptance speech</a>, declared that ever since 9/11, \"I wake up every morning thinking about how to better protect our country. I will never relent in defending America \u2013 whatever it takes.\" It erupted again when he added:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"In Saddam Hussein, we saw a threat. Members of both political parties, including my opponent and his running-mate, saw the threat, and voted to authorize the use of force.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>I thought, or at least hoped, that such vulgar crowd celebrations of leader-reverence, jingoism and militarism would not soon be replicated. But on Thursday night, the final night of the Democratic party convention, it was.</p> <p>It is hard to count how many times a Democratic party speaker stood up proudly to proclaim:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Osama. Bin. Laden. Is. Dead!</p> </blockquote> <p>Almost every time Bin Laden's scalp was paraded around on its pike \u2013 all thanks to the warrior spirit and unflinching courage of our commander-in-chief \u2013 the crowd of progressives, liberals and party faithful erupted into a prolonged \"USA. USA\" chant.</p> <p>Leading this orgy of chest-beating, we're-more-bellicose-than-you, nationalistic strutting was, ironically, the 2004 GOP's prime victim of it: Democratic Senator John Kerry. <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/dnc-2012-john-kerrys-speech-to-the-democratic-national-convention-full-text/2012/09/06/bb73367e-f87c-11e1-a073-78d05495927c_story_2.html\">Kerry's speech</a> exploited virtually every theme of patriotism and militarism that was used against him eight years ago, and he did so with great efficacy.</p> <p>Like <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/report/obama-foreign-policy-successes/\">Obama advocates so often do</a>, Kerry first trumpeted how faithful and loyal Obama is to the Israeli government, and held up the Israeli prime minister as the arbiter of truth and sufficient loyalty:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"'Barack Obama promised always to stand with Israel to tighten sanctions on Iran \u2013 and take nothing off the table.</p> <p>\"'Again and again, the other side has lied about where this president stands and what this president has done. But Prime Minister Netanyahu set the record straight \u2013 he said, our two countries have 'exactly the same policy' \u2013 'our security cooperation is unprecedented.' When it comes to Israel, I'll take the word of Israel's prime minister over Mitt Romney any day.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Kerry, to the delight of the crowd, strongly insinuated that Romney harbors disrespect for the sacred American troops (that is: our brave men and women in uniform): </p> <blockquote> <p>\"And let me say \u2013 let me say something else \u2013 let me say something else, no nominee for president should ever fail in the midst of a war to pay tribute to our troops overseas in his acceptance speech.</p> <p>(APPLAUSE)</p> <p>\"Mitt Romney \u2013 Mitt Romney was talking about America. They are on the front lines every day defending America and they deserve our thanks.\"</p> <p>(APPLAUSE)</p> <p>[AUDIENCE:] \"USA! USA! USA!\"</p> </blockquote> <p>And, most pointedly of all, he milked the Bin Laden killing for everything it was worth, and then some:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"And after more than \u2013 after more than 10 years without justice for thousands of Americans murdered on 9/11, after Mitt Romney said it would be naive to go into Pakistan to pursue the terrorists, it took President Obama, against the advice of many, to give that order and finally rid this earth of Osama bin Laden.</p> <p>(APPLAUSE)</p> <p>\"Ask Osama bin Laden is he is better-off now than he was four years ago.\"</p> <p>(APPLAUSE)</p> </blockquote> <p>Yeah: ask Osama bin Laden if he's better off \u2013 if you can find his corpse where our commander-in-chief dumped it: at the bottom of the ocean. USA! USA!</p> <p>For the moment, leave aside one's views on the justness and legality of the Bin Laden killing. (For reasons <a href=\"http://opiniojuris.org/2012/08/29/author-of-no-easy-day-admits-to-committing-a-war-crime\">adeptly set forth here</a> by international law professor Kevin Jon Heller, I really don't understand how one can have a favorable opinion on that without actually knowing what happened, which may be the reason John Kerry is <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/politicolive/0511/Kerry_Shut_up_and_move_on_.html\">so insistent</a> that nobody try to find out.) Whether or not one is still stimulated when thinking about that exciting raid, there is obvious meaning in how central it has become to the political identity of America and, especially, the self-esteem of the Democratic party.</p> <p>It is a truly potent indicator that this grand achievement has become the greatest source of nationalistic pride. Americans once found national purpose \u2013 justification for their belief in their own exceptionalism \u2013 from inventing new life-improving technologies, or putting a man on the moon, or advancing the cause of equality, or vanquishing the mighty Nazi military machine, or enshrining unparalleled protections for core liberties in the constitution. </p> <p>Now, many Americans find it in the heroic ability to hunt someone down who is in hiding, pummel his skull full of bullets even as he lay dying on the ground, and then dump his corpse into the ocean. That such actions are the new source of American pride, vindication of national greatness, was the claim made by President Obama when he <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2011/05/02/135908803/video-and-text-of-the-presidents-statement-on-death-of-bin-laden\">first announced the killing</a>: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"But tonight, we are once again reminded that America can do whatever we set our mind to. That is the story of our history.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>If one wants to mount a political defense of all of this \u2013 that it is about time the Democrats gave the GOP a taste of its own medicine, that Kerry, in particular, has the right to exact vengeance, that anything is justified to win the election, etc \u2013 that's fine. I have no real quarrel with, or interest in, that perspective. In so many ways \u2013 political adeptness, party solidarity, effective exploitation of national security for political gain, media favorability, message discipline \u2013 the two parties have experienced a radical role reversal in the matter of a few short years, and it's understandable why one is happy about that if one's overarching political concern is Obama's re-election.</p> <p>But the collective bloodlust on display over the last week, especially Thursday night, was nothing short of creepy. Even in those instances in which state killing is justified and necessary, it ought to be a sombre and regrettable affair (as many Democrats <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/tv/gop-debate-crowd-applauds-gov-rick-perrys-record-of-executions-in-texas/\">righteously argued</a> when some attendees at a GOP debate cheered Texas Governor Rick Perry's touting of his execution record). Boastful, raucous, nationalistic crowd-chanting at every single mention of someone's corpse, even when that someone is Osama bin Laden, is warped.</p> <p>But, more importantly, it's a depressing symbol of America's political culture. The premise seems to be that \u2013 aside from this specific corpse and the others the president has piled up \u2013 there is little else for ordinary Americans to celebrate now when it comes to the search for nationalistic achievement, purpose and greatness among their political leadership. That this dark premise appears valid is what is most disturbing of all.</p> <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> As Gawker's pseudonymous writer Mobutu Sese Seko <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5941276/running-on-empty-obama-omitted-details-drones-and-his-best-chance-at-dynamism\">notes in an excellent review of the night's festivities</a>, Joe Biden \"laid it on especially thickly when it came to talking about whacking Osama bin Laden\". Among other things, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/09/06/160713378/transcript-vice-president-bidens-convention-speech\">the vice president crowed</a> that \"Obama is our president because he always has the courage to make the tough decisions.\" Of the kill order: \"He said, do it \u2013 and justice was done!\" And then:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"And he also knew \u2013 he also knew the message we had to send around the world: if you attack innocent Americans, we will follow you to the end of the earth.</p> <p>(CHEERS, APPLAUSE.)</p> <p>\"Look \u2026\"</p> <p>[AUDIENCE:] \"USA! USA! USA! USA!\"</p> </blockquote> <p>He further suggests that it may not be \"justice\" that is achieved by \"a double-tap to the brain of a sclerotic masturbating whitehair and his family, in the dead of night, by trained killers.\" Rather, he argues, \"justice\" likely entails \u2013 following the Allied and Israeli example of how Nazi war criminals were treated \u2013 a trial, with evidence of guilt shown to the world, and a deliberative punishment then meted out.</p> <p>Again, though, regardless of one's views on that question, there is a world of difference between approving of the Bin Laden hit, on the one hand, and gathering together to chant nationalistic slogans and feel pulsating crowd-based power from it, on the other.</p> <p><strong>UPDATE II</strong>: I believe I just saw one of the best videos ever: Gawker's John Cook spent several days asking numerous Democratic luminaries at the convention about Obama's kill list and whether they would trust Mitt Romney to decide which Americans should be extra-judicially assassinated. Other than Bill Press, none reacted well, and <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5941326/ask-the-dnc-is-romney-ready-for-the-kill-list\">it is really worth watching</a>.</p>",

He didn't just deliver a great address, he reminded us what political rhetoric can be \u2013 elevating, challenging, informative, respectful to those of us listening, rather than the patronising spew of TV soundbites that passes as oratory these days (we've heard plenty of that this week as well).</p> <p>The spirit of the delegates. They schlepped to Charlotte from all over the country, endured appalling weather, then most of them were told at the last minute they couldn't get into the arena after the larger stadium event was cancelled. And still, after all that, they were singing and chanting and laughing as they filed in to the spill-over room. Now that's dedication.</p> <p>And finally Gabby Giffords. We expect courage in our leaders, and are so often disappointed. Giffords' slightly shuffling walk across the stage, in front of 20,000 delegates and millions more watching on TV, and her delivery of an almost perfect Pledge of Allegiance, was a display of bravery in its purest form. How Americans can watch that, then not rise up as one nation to demand gun control, is beyond me.</p> <h2>Ana Marie Cox</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395819912\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/9/28/1317225418768/Annmarie_Cox.jpg\" alt=\"Ana Marie Cox\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The nosebleed-level press seats strategically placed behind the backdrop to the convention podium would be easy to complain about: the lines of sight gave a great view of the black curtains on either side of the stage but you could see neither the speaker nor the giant television projection of the speaker. But Bill Clinton is so good, it hardly mattered. I could see the teleprompter. </p> <p>As the Big Dog waltzed through a thicket of policy points, dropping drawl-inflected catchphrases, the teleprompter stuttered. He gracefully ad-libbed, and the prompter showed in real time the exact degree to which his rhetoric soared without a net. It was a small insight in some ways \u2013 everyone knows Clinton can't stick to a script \u2013 but a big lesson if you compare it to the Eastwood debacle of the week before: there is no amount of acting experience, and extemporizing what to say, that can compensate for knowing what people want to hear.</p> <h2>Gary Younge</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395819913\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/artsblog/authorpics/gary_younge.jpg\" alt=\"Gary Younge\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>My favourite moment was the spunky, rousing and quite eccentric contribution by the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Emanuel Cleaver. Part sermon, part polemic, off-script but on message, he fired up the audience more than any other speaker I saw this week. Theatrical to a fault he called on the audience to persevere against Republican intransigence and support the president in doing the same. Marching on the spot he said: \"Mr President when all hope is gone, hope on!\" he said \"Hope on! It is our hope and faith that moves us to action! It is our hope that instructs us to hope on!\"</p> <h2>Richard Adams</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395819914\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/artsblog/authorpics/richard_adams.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Adams\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The highlight for me was the difference in tone in Charlotte compared with the Republicans in Tampa \u2013 something that was made clear on the opening day of the DNC.</p> <p>Tuesday's session was packed full of compelling testimony and a realization that the Democrats weren't going to run away from policies on healthcare, equal pay and abortion as they have in the past.</p> <p>While the rescheduled first day in Tampa was a snoozefest, Tuesday in Charlotte had the sight of Cory Booker banging the podium with fervor, Tammy Duckworth walking on stage with two artificial limbs, mute testimony to her service in Iraq, and former Ohio governor Ted Strickland launching into a barnburner, accusing Mitt Romney of \"lying and hiding\" his policies and tax returns. There was the redoubtable Lilly Ledbetter on the fight for equal pay and Maryland governor Martin O'Malley calling Romney unpatriotic, saying \"Swiss bank accounts never built an American bridge.\"</p> <p>And all that was before the night's keynotes from Julian Castro and Michelle Obama.</p> <p>Tuesday's electricity set the stage for Bill Clinton's triumphant speech the following night and gave the DNC an attitude that it never lost.</p> <h2>Adam Gabbatt </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395819915\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/4/19/1334856266547/Adam-Gabbatt-byline-pic-003.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Gabbatt byline pic\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adam Gabbatt byline pic.

Giffords, who is still struggling with injuries from when she was shot during a constituency meeting in Tucson last year, was accompanied by close friend and DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz but made her way unaided across the stage, beaming every step of the way. Giffords resigned from Congress in January to focus on her recovery, and was clearly delighted to return to the political arena to deliver the pledge. The pride and passion as she spoke was clear to see, and translated to the crowd, who variously cheered, applauded, and wept.</p> <h2>Ewen MacAskill</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395819916\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/01/21/ewen_macaskill_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Ewen Macaskill\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Bill Clinton provided the most memorable moments of either convention. Brilliant, old-fashioned speech, from the days before teleprompters became all-dominant. I have seen him speak lots of times since first hearing him on a rainy night in Belfast in the 1990s, trying to keep the tentative peace talks alive and he did. </p> <p>That night in Belfast was special, but so was his speech in Charlotte. The Obama campaign has been struggling to provide a coherent, consistent message for why voters should re-elect the president: Clinton provided them with one. Ad-libbing for much of the speech, he was able to make detailed policy issues accessible. Towards the end, there was a danger he was starting to lose the crowd, going on a little too long, and just at that point he summed it all up.</p>",
  "<p>The US economy added just 96,000 new jobs in August, far below economists' expectations and dealing a crushing blow to President Barack Obama after the close of the Democratic national convention.</p> <p>The numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics came after a positive independent report had stoked expectations that August might have been a good month for US jobs. In July the US added 163,000 jobs and economists expected that figure to be about 125,000 in August.</p> <p>In fact, the numbers were much worse that predicted, and ensured the would be no post-convention glow for Obama. While the unemployment rate fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 8.1%, it has remained above 8% for three years, a figure unseen since the Great Depression. In any case, the rate only fell because fewer unemployed people were looking for work.</p> <p>Obama, who was aware of the numbers when he spoke in Charlotte on Thursday night, promised that things would improve. \"America, I never said this journey would be easy, and I won't promise that now,\" he said. \"Yes our path is harder, but it leads to a better place. Yes, our road is longer, but we travel it together.\"</p> <p>Mitt Romney wasted no time in claiming political advantage. He said in a statement: \"If last night was the party, this morning is the hangover. For every net new job created, nearly four Americans gave up looking for work entirely.\"</p> <p>He said that Obama had failed to live up to his promises and pushed home the message that the US is not better off than it was four years ago. Promising to create 12m new jobs by the end of his first term, he said: \"America deserves new leadership that will get our economy moving again.\"</p> <p>Earlier this week an independent survey from payroll specialist ADP showed private employers hired 201,000 people last month, the most in five months. raising expectations that the numbers would not be so bad.</p> <p>But in fact, they were worse even than they first appeared. The headline payroll increase of 96,000 is below population growth, and the figures for July and June were revised downwards.</p> <p>The report puts the spotlight back on the Federal Reserve: last week Fed chairman Ben Bernanke made clear the fragile jobs market remained a \"grave concern\", in a speech that raised expectations for a further easing of monetary policy.</p> <p>The US economy has added jobs every month since September 2010. But after a winter that was better than expected, the hiring rate cooled significantly over the last three months to an average of 105,000. Between January and March, the figure was 226,000.</p> <p>Economists blame the slowdown on Europe's continuing economic woes and US worries over the so-called fiscal cliff, the expiration of Bush era tax cuts and imposition of draconian spending cuts at the end of the year unless political compromise can be made in Washington.</p> <p>Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG said the details of the report were even worse than the headline numbers. The unemployment rate fell because there were less people in total in the jobs market. The \"participation rate\" fell to a 30 year low of 63.5%.</p> <p>\"As negatively as people will take the headline number, the earnings data is even worse. Average hourly earnings were flat in the month as the year on year rate fell to 1.7%. While this is unchanged from the prior month, it remains at extraordinarily low levels and has been low since early 2010,\" Greenhaus wrote in a note to clients.</p> <p>\"Additionally, hours worked fell by one tenth.

Estimates for jobs growth for the previous two months were cut back by 41,000 jobs and there were signs that growth in temporary employment \u2013 a leading indicator for recovery in the jobs market \u2013 was slowing, he said.</p> <p>\"The demand just isn't there. People are worried about Europe, the fiscal cliff, the election, no one wants to open their pocketbooks,\" said Faucher.</p> <p>In a speech last week Bernanke described the current economic situation as \"far from satisfactory\" and said high rates of unemployment threatened to \"wreak structural damage on our economy that could last for many years\".</p>",
  "<p>It's time for our weekly roundup of the best new Android apps for smartphones and tablets, drawn from a mixture of Google Play digging, press releases and submissions from developers.</p> <p>Games aren't included \u2013 they get a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/2012/sep/06/best-mobile-games-avengers-horn\">separate roundup</a> which has plenty of Android games this week. The weekly iOS apps roundup will be published later in the day.</p> <p>Here's this week's Android selection:</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twoergo.appshell.pe\">PizzaExpress</a></h2> <p>Fancy a pizza? UK chain Pizza Express' innovative app has been ported from iOS to Android, enabling customers to book tables, and then pay for their bill using PayPal at the end of their meals. The app will also provide regular offer codes, and it ties in with the chain's Click &amp; Collect takeaway-ordering service too.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.radiumone.viame_android\">Via.me</a></h2> <p>Pitching itself as a \"social storyboard\", Via.me is an app for sharing photos, videos, audio and text on a standalone social network, as well as through Facebook and Twitter. That means photo filters, feeds of friends' activity \u2013&#xa0;assuming they're on it, of course \u2013&#xa0;and notifications aplenty.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.whitehouse\">White House</a></h2> <p>The official White House app has been out for a little while, but what's new this week is a version for Android tablets, just as the US presidential election gets into swing. Expect news, photos and videos from the White House, including live video streams of events featuring the president himself, and his officials.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quora.android\">Quora</a></h2> <p>Lots of people in Silicon Valley have been getting excited about Q&amp;A service Quora for a while now, thanks to plenty of tech executives giving candid views on their industry. Can it become more mainstream through mobile apps? The new Android version is a step in that direction, providing a usable window into Quora, and lots of Android-specific widgetry and features.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aurasma.skinned.richard_and_judy_book_club\">Richard and Judy Book Club</a></h2> <p>Out on iOS a couple of weeks ago, WHSmith's official app for this year's Richard and Judy Book Club initiative is the latest example of branded augmented reality. Using HP subsidiary Aurasma's AR technology, it encourages readers to scan covers of participating books to watch reviews and other videos.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.utorrent.client\">\u00b5Torrent Beta</a></h2> <p>Possibly controversial, this, but on the basis that it's a significant new release \u2013&#xa0;and that there are a number of non-copyright-infringing uses for it \u2013&#xa0;\u00b5Torrent makes our selection this week. It's a beta Android client for one of BitTorrent's two clients (the other, BitTorrent itself, already has an Android beta). For now it's free, and aims to make it easy to find and download torrents, including RSS feed subscriptions.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.telly\">Telly</a></h2> <p>This sounds like it should be some kind of social TV / second-screen app, but actually it's more of a social videos play, taking on Socialcam and Viddy. The idea: shoot videos, add music, and then share on Facebook and Twitter, as well as through Telly's own standalone social network. It's the work of Twitvid, which was one of the first social video startups.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kinderphone.kinder\">KinderPhone</a></h2> <p>This app is the latest attempt to make Android smartphones safe for children (see also: Famigo Sandbox). The idea is that parents install the app on their child's phone, and can then monitor what they're doing in terms of apps, social networking and calls. It also has \"check-ins messages\" to make it quicker for children to let their parents know their current location. A bit Big Brother? That's a debate worth having. If a child is old enough to be given an Android smartphone, are they also old enough to not have their usage of it monitored this closely?</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stuxbot.android.bbs\">Blue Badge Style</a></h2> <p>Stuxbot Technology's new Android app wants to be \"a guide for a less able lifestyle\". That means a location-based guide to restaurants, bars, cafes and so on, but with an emphasis on how accessible they are (for example: wheelchairs). The app can also be used to call venues for bookings, or browse their websites, and it recommends nearby places with reviews.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gojee.android\">Gojee - Food &amp; Drink Recipes</a></h2> <p>\"Prepare yourself for a happy mouth explosion,\" shouts Gojee's Android app description, by way of introduction (in capitals). It's an app aggregating food and drink recipes from more than 200 foody blogs, and presenting them with lip-smacking photography in a slinky user interface.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.samsungapps.com/topApps/topAppsDetail.as?productId=G00008893310\">Zara</a></h2> <p>Samsung has bagged an initial exclusive on the official Android app from fashion house Zara. On offer is the company's catalogue, refreshed every week, with options to buy clothes, and scan barcodes when in a store for more information and alternative colours.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tripayo.tripayomobile\">Meet Travellers by Tripayo</a></h2> <p>There's a mini-blitz of social travel apps in 2012, as startups scramble to help travellers connect to friends and strangers alike for better information on destinations. Tripayo's new app is, as its name makes clear, about hooking up with fellow travellers while on your jaunts \u2013&#xa0;presumably for friendship or more, depending on the situation. Hotel and flight-bookings features are also included. </p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.interchain.radiowalla\">Radiowalla</a></h2> <p>Indian online radio service Radiowalla has launched its official Android app, offering its hand-picked selection of streaming stations in music, sports and talk genres. Some shows can be listened to on-demand, too.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.prometheusgm.thr.android\">Hollywood Reporter</a></h2> <p>Hollywood industry magazine The Hollywood Reporter has taken its app to Android, offering a feed of news, views and videos from the film, TV and music industries. Social features are also built in.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.techsmith.apps.coachseye\">Coach's Eye</a></h2> <p>TechSmith's Coach's Eye app is a very clever tool for athletes (pro or otherwise) and coaches. The idea: \"video capture with slow-motion review, drawing tools, and simple sharing\" to analyse your performance and learn to do things better, whether that's running, throwing or swinging a golf club.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ensight.android.radioalarm\">Internet Radio (Beta)</a></h2> <p>Another app that does what it says on the title. EnsightMedia's app offers 50,000 streaming radio stations drawn from Shoutcast's radio directory, with search features, a sleep timer and some skeuomorphic design touches to make it look like a vintage radio.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.qz.Foneclay\">Foneclay</a></h2> <p>Android is already one of the more customisable smartphone operating systems, through its own widgets and third-party apps. Foneclay is the latest example of the latter, promising \"immersive, art-interfaces as dynamic as you are\". Including, as you'll see from its Google Play screenshots, big yellow monsters. It's a more fun take on the phone-customisation apps genre.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azumio.android.sleeptime\">Sleep Time Alarm Clock</a></h2> <p>If I had a pound for every alarm-clock app I've seen go live on Google Play, I'd be too busy browsing speedboat catalogues to write this roundup. Sadly, most of them are rubbish. Sleep Time \u2013&#xa0;Alarm Clock is one of the better ones though: a \"sleep cycle alarm clock\" that aims to detect your movements in bed using your device's accelerometer, then wake you up at the right moment to avoid grogginess.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=se.fingerfunk.chestburster\">Chestburster</a></h2> <p>Some fun here, of the augmented-reality-t-shirt-to-make-an-alien-burst-out-of-your-chest variety. Scan one of Fingerfunk's t-shirts and, yes, an alien will burst out of the person's chest. A novelty, yes, but a useful showcase for what's possible with technology like the Unity 3D game engine and Qualcomm's Vuforia AR platform (both used here).</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vibease.app\">Vibease - Chat and Vibrator</a></h2> <p>And a bit more fun to finish off, although \"finish off\" is perhaps not the best phrase to use in this context. Vibease promises \"soothing ambient sound and customizable vibration rhythm\", as well as a private social network for couples to... Well, make one another's smartphones buzz. The app will also work with a separate Vibease vibrator for true Android-fuelled sexytime. Not a phrase you'll be reading in this column for a while, thankfully.</p> <p>That's our selection, but what have you been using this week on your Android smartphone or tablet?

  "<p>Vladimir Putin, whatever else one might think of him, has a certain genius for the theatricality of power. Among his many stunts, communing with wild animals has always played a special role. But whereas his previous performances have been displays of manly courage \u2013 petting <a href=\"http://www.treehugger.com/corporate-responsibility/was-putins-pledge-to-clean-up-the-arctic-just-in-preparation-for-messing-it-up-again.html\" title=\"\">polar bears</a> or tranquilising <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/22/world/asia/22tiger.html\" title=\"\">tigers</a> \u2013 on Wednesday seemed to show a gentler side: Putin as good shepherd, albeit <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/06/vladimir-putin-cranes-hang-glider?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">to a flock of Siberian white cranes</a>. The message of the underlying symbolism, however, remained the same: that the Russian president is omnipotent and benevolent, sole dispenser of salvation.</p> <p>The stunt itself was pure pantomime: Putin in a motorised hang-glider showing the innocent young fledglings the way to freedom. In order to convince the cranes that he was their legitimate leader, the head of the Russian state cunningly disguised himself as one of them in an all-white suit with black gloves (they are white with black wingtips). Thus clad, he assumed his natural role as alpha-crane and took off.</p> <p>Despite the president's efforts, the birds showed little enthusiasm: only one crane followed the hang glider when Putin flew for the first time, while the other birds sceptically observed from the ground. On a second attempt, however, five cranes took off with Putin, which was regarded by his entourage as good enough. The resident crane experts \u2013 who had branded the mission \"flight of hope\" \u2013 explained the lack of engagement on the birds' side by strong wind, reminiscent of the references to \"bad weather\" made by election campaigners forced to apologise for the low turnout of pro-Putin voters in their districts.</p> <p>The Siberian cranes had been born and raised in captivity, so perhaps it is not surprising that they needed some guidance in flying. It might, however, seem surprising that this guidance needed to come from the Kremlin directly. But this is actually entirely in keeping with Putin's view of his country: Russia is like a zoo, whose dim-witted and potentially dangerous inhabitants, human and animal, must be carefully guided by their keeper.</p> <p>The ideology of the zoo is that a select few \u2013 the human species \u2013 have both a right and a duty to nurture and conserve the others. Animals cannot be expected to look after themselves, but must, like the Siberian white cranes, be bred in captivity then taught in which direction to fly. This requires a strictly authoritarian approach: if the lions were to decide for themselves where to take their daily exercise, there would soon be no more zebras. With unreasoning brutes, anything other than a top-down, rule-governed regime would result in chaos and collapse.</p> <p>Similarly, Putin believes his countrymen to be incapable of looking after themselves. Were it not for a select few \u2013 himself and his henchman \u2013 they would at best be like chimps at a tea party, at worst, fall upon and devour each other. This is of course the ideology of the benevolent dictatorship, or better the zoo director. The flipside of the white cranes' flying lesson is locking the animals up at night for their own safety.</p> <p>But despite the recent images of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/08/pussy-riot-trial-closing-statement\" title=\"\">Pussy Riot behind bars</a>, the real Russia is not quite so full of cages as a zoo. The pantomime of power therefore requires, at least in part, the willingness of the inhabitants to believe in the authority of their benign director. Just as some of the birds went along with Putin's alpha-crane outfit, some Russians go along with his mantle of benevolent leader. But this year's protests suggests that others are choosing, like those cranes that stayed firmly on the ground, to see through the costume.</p>",

One could argue, and I personally would, that the Republicans offer neither. Their convention's speeches were as solid and workmanlike, as their policy planks are flexible and ungrounded. </p> <p>Both Clinton and Obama tangled with reality but gave their sympathetic audiences a chance to ignore it, and to focus instead on the sweeping momentum of history. The jobs numbers just remind us that history does not sweep, it stumbles.</p> <p>The fact that Obama knew the jobs numbers last night, even as he worked up the crowd with a recitation of what \"you did\", suggests that, on some level, the comparatively muted spiritual dimension of the speech was intentional. He could not have gone on stage and done too much preaching; he needed to limit the distance of this morning's fall. </p> <p>Was the decision to rein in the \"hopey-changey\" aspects of Obama's promise to Americans the right one? Or should he have attempted to raise us all up to the levels he has in the past? Ugly buildings, whores, and campaign tactics all get more respectable with age. Obama gave voters an IV drip of inspiration, we'll see if that level of existence keeps hope alive.</p> <p><em>Ana Marie Cox is US political columnist for the Guardian</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/michael-cohen\">Michael Cohen</a>: 'This was not the glossy rhetoric of the 2008 campaign'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395811525\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/5/1/1335856877642/michael-cohen-003.jpg\" alt=\"michael cohen\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">michael cohen Photograph: Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At their core, presidential elections are choices: a choice between two candidates and two parties, a choice between two ideas of government and a choice between two visions for the country's future. And in his acceptance speech at the Democratic convention in Charlotte, President Obama made this singular decision, faced by voters, the crucial theme of his speech:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"When all is said and done, when you pick up that ballot to vote. You will face the clearest choice of any time in a generation. Over the next few years, big decisions will be made in Washington, on jobs and the economy; taxes and deficits; energy and education; war and peace \u2013 decisions that will have a huge impact on our lives and our children's lives for decades to come.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The rest of the speech was Obama's rather one-sided take on how Democrats and Republicans see those choices \u2013 between more support for manufacturing jobs in the United States and \"tax breaks to ship jobs overseas\"; between doubling the use of renewable energy and letting \"oil companies write this country's energy plan\"; between an internationalist foreign policy that takes on America's enemies and one \"stuck in a cold war time warp\".</p> <p>You don't have to buy the notion that the decision for voters is this binary, but no one ever said political rhetoric was subtle. After three days of a convention that sought to define Mitt Romney as an out-of-touch 1%er, that catered to the concerns of core Democratic constituencies and trumpeted the President's record of accomplishment, Obama's job was to make their decision as stark as possible, while at the same time giving voters a real sense that he had a vision for the future that reflected their concerns. As Obama said repeatedly, \"You can choose that future.\"</p> <p>The result was not a typical soaring Obama speech and, from this correspondent's vantage point, seemed almost self-consciously to tamp down the glossy rhetoric of the 2008 campaign trail. Rather, this speech was workmanlike in its approach; more effective than ebullient; and less about change and more about choices.</p> <p>There were memorable touches, as well: paeans to patriotism that were in the spirit of an evening heavy on national security; a lovely digression on the meaning of freedom that sought to cast it as practically indistinguishable from liberalism; and Obama's own take on \"you didn't build that\" \u2013 \"you did that.\"</p> <p>There was almost a sense of wariness in the president's words \u2013 one that reflected the country's and the Obama's struggles, both economic and political, over the last four years. At the same time, this was a president who came across as confident and determined. This was not Obama's best speech; but it was one that was solid and offered voters a clear and unambiguous sense of the choice they face this November.</p> <p>In the end, that was Obama's purpose after his wife's and former President Clinton's rousing addresses. He didn't have to be great, he just had to be effective \u2013 and he was.</p> <p><em>Michael Cohen is a US political columnist for the Observer and the Guardian</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ryan-streeter\">Ryan Streeter</a>: 'A lost opportunity to talk about jobs, the economy and opportunity'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395811526\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/7/1347020449938/ryanstreeter_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Ryan Streeter\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Locked in a virtual tie with Mitt Romney, Barack Obama gave a speech aimed at the undecided voters who will make all the difference in November, while trying to keep the fire lit beneath his base. Doing both is more challenging than in the past because of the widening gulf between Obama's base and independent voters.</p> <p>The American media regularly talk about how Republicans have jolted rightward because of the Tea Party, but no one talks about the leftward surge of the Democratic party. The Blue Dog coalition, which not long ago was a centrist Democratic force in Congress, has imploded.</p> <p>The Democratic party has become less the political home to the journeyman in Ohio and more the plaything of coastal wealthy elites such as Nancy Pelosi. That's why the Democratic party's 2012 platform endorsed gay marriage, removed any reference to God, and omitted reference to Jerusalem. It was only after Obama's unexplained admonishment, and a bewildering mid-convention vote, that the latter two were forced back into the document.</p> <p>The convention's relentless promotion of abortion rights and pseudo-populist diatribes against \"millionaires and billionaires\" cemented the party's leftward tilt. As much as the unemployed factory worker in Pennsylvania harbours no affection for the rich, the convention offered him little.</p> <p>So, in his acceptance speech, Obama tried to reach that worker. But he failed. Unlike four years ago, when Obama talked of specific policies, he rattled off a laundry list of centrist-sounding goals, encased in unoriginal, sub-par speechwriting. He tried to address too many topics in general without talking specifically about jobs, the economy, or opportunity. </p> <p>And with that, Obama lost a huge opportunity. Nothing in his speech told the undecided middle-class voter that anything in the next four years would be different than the unfulfilled promises of the last four.</p> <p><em>Ryan Streeter is a conservative strategist and distinguished fellow at Sagamore Institute</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alex-slater\">Alex Slater</a>: 'It was sadly short on specifics'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395811527\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/12/7/1291745438055/Alex-Slater-002.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Slater\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alex Slater</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Obama faced a critical task tonight. Right now, the president is defying political gravity, roughly ahead of his opponent in the polls, but facing 60% of Americans saying the country is on the wrong track. His own personal ratings are no better: his support is under 50%.</p> <p>So, what do you do when you're defying political gravity? You make the election about the opponent. And you go negative. So far, the president's campaign has done a pretty good job doing so. Attacks on Bain, Romney's tax returns, foreign policy in experience, even Olympic ponies. </p> <p>But on Thursday night, President Obama had a more important task: to outline exactly what he would do with four more years. Ironically, Joe Biden, in his warm-up act, criticized Romney for a lack of ideas. But it was for Obama to deliver the big vision. <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21561890\">As the Economist put it</a>, \"Surely this charismatic, thoughtful man has more ideas about what must be done than he has so far let on?\"</p> <p>Well, let's make no mistake: it was a good speech. But if there's one thing we know, it's that Barack Obama can give a great speech.</p> <p>Sadly, it was short on specifics \u2013 as Candy Crowley said on CNN, \"it was less about the future than we expected.\" Instead, it was an unexpected combination of attacks on Romney, Obama's positive four-year record \u2013 Osama's name may have been mentioned more over the course of the night than Obama's \u2013 and a relatively brief list of voter-getter issues. Education, of course, though the likelihood of cutting university tuition in half is, at best, unlikely. Veterans, obviously. Taxes, tick. American workers. Union pandering.</p> <p>But what about healthcare? What about cap and trade? Surely, these issues deserved a clearer vision?</p> <p>Yet it was a great speech. Why? Because it was presidential \u2013 not the animated candidate we saw in 2008. Because he was contrite. Because he moved from hope and change, to hope and faith.</p> <p>Obama is lucky, of course. The Republicans have also presented few new ideas. So, it may be that this convention speech simply confirms one thing: this is going to be an election fought over 30-second negative television adverts, not over differing visions for the country. That's sad for this election; it's sad for America.</p> <p>And if polls hold, of course, it leaves open the question of what exactly Obama <em>will</em> do with four more years.</p> <p><em>Alex Slater is a Democratic strategist with Clyde Strategies in Washington, DC</em></p>",
  "<p>In the coded landscape of Israel's intentions regarding a military strike against Iran, the defence minister, Ehud Barak, made a public statement on Thursday which may signify a shift away from unilateral action.</p> <p>Following a meeting with Admiral James Winnefield, the US vice-chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Barak issued the following statement to the media:</p> <blockquote> We face a common challenge but the clock is ticking at a different pace for each of us. We also have our differences; Israel keeps its sovereign right to act independently, and the US understands this. <br> However, there is no doubt about the US readiness to face the challenge on every level.  Only Israel will take decisions regarding its future and security.  However, the US is our most important ally. The intelligence co-operation and the military support are deep and exceptional in scope. I am sure that it will stay this way in any scenario that might happen in the future. </blockquote> <p>One interpretation of this is that Barak is saying: Israel will not give up its right to act alone, but it won't exercise it in the next two or three months.</p> <p>The key phrase is \"the US is our most important ally\" \u2013 a tacit acknowledgement that Israel cannot act in defiance of American disapprobation, which has been made so abundantly clear.</p> <p>A news report in Haaretz offered further quotes from Barak, who was speaking at a gathering of his party members. \"Israel retains its right to make sovereign decisions and the United States respects that. <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/barak-hints-u-s-military-preparations-may-eliminate-israel-s-need-for-iran-strike.premium-1.463308\" title=\"\">However, one should not ignore the impressive preparations by the Americans to counter Iran on all fronts</a>,\" Barak said according to this report. The clear implication is that Israel has new faith in its superpower ally.</p> <p>Some observers detect a significant shift in Barak's stance in recent days and weeks, including my colleague Julian Borger, who wrote a couple of days ago that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2012/sep/04/israel-iran-nuclear\" title=\"\">the odds on a military strike were lengthening</a>.</p> <p>Haaretz carries a piece by Yossi Verter on Friday which starts: \"<a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/reshuffling-the-deck-barak-now-opposes-israeli-strike-on-iran-sources-say.premium-1.463425\" title=\"\">Word is that defence minister Ehud Barak is no longer as gung-ho about an attack on Iran as his media interviews suggest</a> \u2026 A top American source told an Israeli politician this week that the Americans now consider Barak to be a pouring-cold-water-over-things type of person, rather than someone who starts fires. People who have met with him in recent weeks got a similar impression. One said Barak cited his reasons for not attacking now with the same conviction and skill he used to support the opposite approach just two months ago.\"</p> <p>The rightwing Jerusalem Post, however, has a different interpretation of Barak's comments. Its lead story in the print edition on Friday morning says that Barak \"appeared to hint \u2026 that <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/Defense/Article.aspx?id=284189\" title=\"\">he believed the United States would join Israel in a strike on Iran</a> to prevent the Islamic Republic from obtaining nuclear weapons\".</p> <p>The fact that the headlines in both papers begin with the words \"Barak hints\" reflects uncertainty over the defence minister's meaning. But a more temperate mood now seems to be prevailing in Israel.</p>",

More droughts and floods and wildfires are not a joke. They're a threat to our children's future. And in this election, you can do something about it,\" Obama said, to a roar of approval from the hall.</p> <p>The remarks were a pointed and deliberate contrast to Romney. The Republican contender got the biggest laughs of his speech by making fun of candidate Obama's concern on climate change when he first ran in 2008.</p> <p>\"President Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans and to heal the planet,\" <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/08/30/160357612/transcript-mitt-romneys-acceptance-speech\" title=\"\">Romney said</a>. \"My promise is to help you and your family.\" He got a standing ovation.</p> <p>The strong reaction in the hall \u2013 and the outrage from Democrats and others after a summer of heat waves, drought, wildfires and now hurricanes \u2013 all but ensured climate change a mention in Obama's own convention speech a week later.</p> <p>Obama said nothing about taking comprehensive action to limit the emissions that cause climate change. The Democrats' party platform, adopted this week, makes no mention of cap and trade, which Obama supported in 2008.</p> <p>The speech also touted the increase in domestic oil production under the Obama presidency, part of the president's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jan/25/state-of-union-2012-environment\" title=\"\">\"all of the above\" energy policy</a>.</p> <p>Even so, the remarks on climate change were Obama's most visible identification with the issue since December 2009 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/dec/18/obama-speech-copenhagen-climate-summit\" title=\"\">when he flew to Copenhagen and jumped in to all-night negotiation sessions</a> to try to extract a deal at the UN climate change summit.</p> <p>Other Democratic leaders used Romney's remarks to draw a contrast with Republican positions on the environment.</p> <p>Earlier on Thursday night, John Kerry, the Democrats' 2004 presidential candidate, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7420848n\" title=\"\">said</a>: \"An exceptional country does care about the rise of the oceans and the health of the planet.\" Bill Clinton in <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/dnc-2012-bill-clintons-speech-at-the-democratic-national-convention-excerpt/2012/09/05/f208865e-f7a4-11e1-8253-3f495ae70650_story.html\" title=\"\">his speech on Wednesday night</a> also made a passing reference to climate change.</p> <p>The rhetoric, evidently co-ordinated, suggests there will be a lot more talk about climate change from Obama and other Democrats during the election season than during the last four years.</p> <p>Over the past two years, Obama and other administration officials grew noticeably more reluctant to even utter the words climate change, as Republicans adopted attacks on climate science and environmental regulations as one of their core beliefs. Instead, Obama and administration officials shifted their focus to \"clean energy jobs\". On Thursday night, he used the term \"carbon pollution\".</p> <p>Obama made just a single mention of climate change in his state of the union address this year \u2013 but that was still better than 2011 when climate change did not rate a mention at all. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/jan/26/climate-change-obama-bush\" title=\"\">One analysis found</a> Obama devoted even less time to the issue in his annual address to Congress than George Bush.</p> <p>Romney's own views have also shifted since his time as Massachusetts governor when he saw climate change as a matter of urgent concern. And they do not appear to align with the derision in his convention speech, or fellow Republicans who do not accept the existence of climate change.</p> <p>Andrea Saul, his press secretary, said: \"Romney's view on climate change is he believes it's occurring, and that human activity contributes to it, but he doesn't know to what extent.

You elected me to tell you the truth. And the truth is it will take more than a few years for us to solve challenges that have built up over decades.</p> <p>\"But know this, America: Our problems can be solved. Our challenges can be met. The path we offer may be harder but it leads to a better place. And I'm asking you to choose that future.\"</p> <p>Throughout the week Obama campaign officials had been briefing that he would lay out a \"roadmap\" for the next four years to secure economic recovery.&#xa0;</p> <p>He did hold out the prospect of a program that would reverse US decline, hinting at embarking on an ambitious and bold Franklin Roosevelt-style New Deal if re-elected. But he failed to offer much in the way of detail, focusing instead on telling the activists in the hall and the millions watching at home that it was up to them to choose which future they wanted for the country.</p> <p>Obama's formal acceptance of the party's nomination to face Romney for the White House on 6 November was greeted with deafening applause from delegates.&#xa0;</p> <p>The speech had been moved from a 73,000-seater football stadium to the much smaller Time Warner Cable arena, leaving&#xa0;disappointed ticket-holders, mainly party volunteers, to line up for seats at a screening in the nearby convention centre. The thunderstorms that party officials had cited as the reason for the venue change failed to materialise.</p> <p>The tone of Obama's message \u2013 delivered a few hours before the release of the latest monthly job figures \u2013 was subdued compared with the sense of euphoria he created at the Denver convention four years ago. He also struck a very different note from Bill Clinton the night before.&#xa0;</p> <p>The more sober approach was deliberate, a recognition of the mood of disenchantment among some voters, tired of fine oratory and and more interested in his plans for a second term.</p> <p>So Obama was careful to recognise his own shortcomings, at one point telling the crowd that one of the difference from 2008 was that he was \"far more mindful of my own failings, knowing exactly what Lincoln meant when he said: 'I have been driven to my knees many times by the overwhelming conviction that I had no place else to go.'\"&#xa0;</p> <p>Over the course of the 47-minute speech there were occasional flashes of the old idealistic language. \"If you turn away now \u2013 if you buy into the cynicism that the change we fought for isn't possible \u2026 well, change will not happen,\" he pleaded.</p> <p>In a direct call to voters who backed him in 2008 he acknowledged that the challenges are harder this time around.&#xa0;\"Our road is longer \u2013 but we travel it together.&#xa0;We don't turn back.&#xa0;We leave no one behind.&#xa0;We pull each other up.&#xa0;We draw strength from our victories and we learn from our mistakes, but we keep our eyes fixed on that distant horizon.\"</p> <p>He portrayed the election as the most important facing the US for generations, offering a clear choice between those who wanted a government actively engaged in trying to make life better, the Democratic view, and those who favoured small government, the Republicans.</p> <p>\"When all is said and done \u2013 when you pick up that ballot to vote \u2013 you will face the clearest choice of any time in a generation. Over the next few years big decisions will be made in Washington, on jobs and the economy; taxes and deficits; energy and education; war and peace. Decisions that will have a huge impact on our lives and our children's lives for decades to come. &#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>&#xa0;\"On every issue the choice you face won't be just between two candidates or two parties. It will be a choice between two different paths for America.\"&#xa0;</p> <p>Though the main focus of the speech was the economy, Obama delivered an extremely effective swipe at Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan's inexperience over foreign policy.</p> <p>\"My opponent and his running mate are new to foreign policy, but from all that we've seen and heard they want to take us back to an era of blustering and blundering that cost America so dearly,\" he said.</p> <p>He cited Romney's criticism of British preparations for the Olympics. \"You might not be ready for diplomacy with Beijing if you can't visit the Olympics without insulting our closest ally.\"</p> <p>Drawing parallels between his goals and those of FDR, he said the kind of America he wanted to create would take more than a few years to achieve. \"It will require common effort, shared responsibility and the kind of bold, persistent experimentation that Franklin Roosevelt pursued during the only crisis worse than this one,\" he said.</p> <p>Obama promised to create a million new manufacturing jobs by the end of 2016. &#xa0;<br>The president also promised to double exports by the end of 2014 and cut net oil imports in half by 2020.</p> <p>Romney, who is at his home in New Hampshire, told reporters he would not be watching the speech but his campaign manager, Matt Rhoades, said: \"Tonight President Obama laid out the choice in this election, making the case for more of the same policies that haven't worked for the past four years.\"</p> <p>The reaction among Democrats was less ecstatic than the reception they accorded to Clinton or even Obama's wife, Michelle, on Tuesday night. James Carville, a Democratic strategist, described the speech as \"muscular\".&#xa0;</p> <p>The final night of the convention had a Hollywood flavour with speeches by Scarlett Johansson and the Desperate Housewives start Eva Longoria.</p> <p>There were also emotional moments, with the delegates rising to their feet to welcome to the platform Gabby Giffords, the former congresswoman recovering after being shot in the head in an assassination attempt in Arizona last year.</p> <p>One of the strongest speeches came from John Kerry, lambasting Romney for his lack of experience or knowledge of foreign policy.</p> <p>A teary-eyed Joe Biden also accepted the nomination to stand again for the vice-presidency with a speech heavy on auto bailouts and the killing of Osama Bin Laden, designed to appeal to wavering white working class male voters who supported Obama last time.</p> <p>The Democrats paraded Charlie Crist, the former Republican governor of Florida, as evidence that the Tea Party-infused Republican party had become so extreme that moderates such as Crist had been forced out.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 11 September 2012. The original video caption said \"Republican presidential nominee Barack Obama\". This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>As Obama speeches go it was plodding. As a man whose presidency was launched on a great convention speech, he can do better and we know it.&#xa0;Like a master sculptor he has proven his ability to take the raw material of a political moment and carve it rhetorically into something of aesthetic value that both engages and rouses.</p> <p>Indeed, for his opponents that has been their criticism: his inspiring words have not been matched by impressive deeds. He can talk the talk. Last night he had to show he could walk the walk.</p> <p>So fittingly it was a pedestrian address: a deliberate, methodical case for a second term. The best lines had been taken. A nation where people \"get a fair shake\" and \"do their fair share\" and everybody \"plays by the rules\" had been hammered home for the last three days. Both his wife, Michelle, and his surrogate, Bill Clinton, had raised the bar in terms of oratory.</p> <p>His task tonight, though, was not to excite but to explain and engage. \"You could not step twice into the same river,\" noted the Greek philosopher Heraclitus. \"For other waters are ever flowing on to you.\" As Obama pointed out he is now the president, not a candidate, and the country's in a different place. Those looking for Obama's speech to match the impact of his convention address in Denver in 2008 were always in for a disappointment.</p> <p>Back in Denver he could stand on his promise. Now he must stand on his record. He had to give a credible account of the last four years and make a case for the next four. Patience is a tougher sell than hope; endurance will always inspire less than change. He spoke not in terms of a grand narrative but discrete chapters: healthcare, women's rights, energy, educate, manufacturing, foreign policy.</p> <p>\"I won't pretend the path I'm offering is quick or easy. I never have. You didn't elect me to tell you what you wanted to hear. You elected me to tell you the truth. And the truth is, it will take more than a few years for us to solve challenges that have built up over decades,\" he said.</p> <p>\"It will require common effort, shared responsibility, and the kind of bold, persistent experimentation that Franklin Roosevelt pursued during the only crisis worse than this one. And by the way \u2013 those of us who carry on his party's legacy should remember that not every problem can be remedied with another government programme or diktat from Washington.\"</p> <p>With the convention season over there is little doubt that the Democrats had a better week than the Republicans. They needed it. For all the ways in which Obama outshines Mitt Romney, as a candidate he remains vulnerable. The night that the Democratic convention started one poll showed that a majority of Americans believe the country is in \"worse condition\" than when Obama accepted the nomination four years ago and he does not deserve a second term.</p> <p>In an election with few undecided voters he was preaching to the choir. But every choir needs a song to sing. The Democratic faithful have struggled to find their voice against a strident Republican right and stubborn economic ills. on Thursday night Obama was at pains not to promise the earth, but to sound down to earth.</p>"
