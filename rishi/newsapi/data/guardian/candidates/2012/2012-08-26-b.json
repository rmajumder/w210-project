  "<p>The coalition is \"most unlikely\" to meet its two key economic goals before the general election, a conservative thinktank says.</p> <p>In a report published on Monday, the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS) said the coalition had already given up hope of getting rid of the structural deficit by 2015 and that the chance of ensuring that public-sector debt is falling by the time of the next election is now slim.</p> <p>The CPS, whose claims are rejected by the Treasury, also said the government's problems were exacerbated by the fact that many people do not understand the difference between debt and deficit and that they will be shocked to learn that debt (the historic total owed by the nation) will be around \u00a3600bn higher in 2015 than it was in 2010 even though the deficit (annual borrowing) will be lower.</p> <p>The coalition \"will be vulnerable at the next general election when opposition parties could argue that the huge increase in debt is primarily the result of economic incompetence\", the CPS report said.</p> <p>George Osborne, the chancellor, insists his deficit reduction target has always been a rolling mandate and that, as long as Treasury budget plans will eliminate the structural deficit over the following five years, his target is being met.</p> <p>But the CPS said that when Osborne announced his target in 2010 people assumed it meant the structural deficit would go by 2015. The Treasury now accepts this deadline will not be met.</p> <p>The second deadline, involving debt falling as a proportion of GDP by the end of the parliament, is firmer. \"But this rule too is now unlikely to be met,\" the CPS said.</p> <p>The CPS commissioned a poll to find out whether people expected debt to go up or down between 2010 and 2015. Although the government has always said that debt is expected to rise over this period, 47% said they thought the government expected it to fall. Only 10% of respondents said, accurately, that the Treasury expected it to rise.</p> <p>\"There must be a danger for the coalition parties that this could easily be exploited during public debate in the buildup to the next election,\" the CPS said.</p> <p>The Treasury rejected the CPS analysis. \"The independent Office for Budget Responsibility's (OBR) most recent assessment is that the government is broadly on track to meet its debt and deficit targets,\" a spokesman said. \"The OBR will update its forecasts in the autumn.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Bolton-born president of the International Paralympic Committee has called for the word \"disabled\" to be dropped from coverage of the London Games. Sir Philip Craven, who has been president of the Bonn-based IPC since 1991, said it was time to re-examine the language used to describe Paralympians.</p> <p>\"This is sport. It's not disability anything. I come from sport,\" said Craven, who represented Great Britain at wheelchair basketball at five Paralympics between 1972 and 1988. \"There's no need for a replacement. Just use the terminology that people use in sport. You know what the word 'disabled' means. It means something that doesn't work, doesn't function. How would you like to be called that? If you want to use it, that's your decision. But try and drop it. It's not easy to begin with. But just drop it.\"</p> <p>Craven called for use of the word in connection with the Paralympics, which begins on Wednesday with an opening ceremony titled The Enlightenment, to be phased out. Despite his call, the official ParalympicsGB guide for the media suggests the use of the phrase \"disabled person\" as being in line with the 2010 Equality Act.</p> <p>Craven predicted that the London Games, which will feature a record 4,200 athletes representing 165 countries and competing in 20 sports, would take the Paralympics to a \"new frontier\". The London organising committee, which has repeatedly emphasised its aim to treat the Olympics and Paralympics as an integrated whole, is confident that all 2.5 million tickets for the Paralympics will sell out for the first time.</p> <p>Even before the success of the Olympic Games sparked a renewed surge of interest, it had shifted more tickets than for any previous Paralympics. It has sold 2.3 million, with around 200,000 more due to come onto the market as final venue configurations are finalised.</p> <p>\"It's the first time we've had such a long and fruitful relationship with an organising committee. It doesn't surprise me, knowing also the British people and their love of true sport, it doesn't worry me about having to live up to something because I just know the 4,200 Paralympians will do that,\" said Craven.</p> <p>\"What has really thrilled me is the way that the British public has come out this summer and just caught the fever. That's going to continue with the Paralympics, I just know it is.\"</p> <p>The Games will feature 16 National Paralympic Committees fielding teams for the first time, including Albania, Antigua, Malawi and Rwanda, the first sub-Saharan country to compete in a Paralympic Games. Other countries, including the Ukraine and Brazil, that have recently invested heavily in Paralympic sport are expected to challenge the British team's aim of matching their Beijing achievement of finishing second in the medal table. Craven said he expected US athletes to challenge strongly, despite a history of under-investment in Paralympic sport. American broadcaster NBC will show just five-and-a-half hours of the Paralympics, none of it live. That compares with more than 150 hours that will be shown by Channel 4.</p> <p>\"It would be a bit boring if they all got it and they were all doing it and there were no new frontiers,\" said Craven, who added that the IPC had developed its own online broadcasting operation to compensate for the lack of coverage in some territories.</p> <p>He said it was important to remember how far the Paralympic movement had come since 1988, when the Seoul Games marked the first time that it had been held in parallel with the Olympics in the same host city. \"There is this aura about the whole Games. From all over the world, people want to be in London,\" explained Craven. There are hopes that the London Games will inspire a new wave of commercial attention in the Paralympics and those who compete in it.</p> <p>Craven said that the renewal of its partnership deal with the International Olympic Committee to co-host the Games would help that process. \"It's a good and developing relationship and we've just signed a deal to ensure that continues to 2018 and 2020,\" he said. \"But we've also signed a partnership agreement, which we've never had before. Part of that involves the development of joint sponsorship or the promotion of both Games.\"</p> <p>The IPC president also defended the involvement of Atos, the IT giant whose name adorns the lanyards of all accredited Games athletes and staff but has been criticised by disability rights campaigners for its involvement in assessing whether benefit claimants are \"fit for work\".</p> <p>Craven said he could understand the Paralympics being used a vehicle to articulate wider concerns but said the IPC's involvement with the company had been \"very positive\". \"All I can say is that we have a record over the last 60 or 65 years of being a fighter for the right causes. That's what we will continue to do. But where they seem to be very upset with this particular part of that company's organisation, our experiences within the Paralympic movement with Atos are very positive,\" he insisted.</p> <p>\"They have given us incredible help with the development of our new website. That isn't just people putting their expertise in, that's people working night and day and really giving of themselves to make sure the deadline was met.\"</p>",
  "<p>Thousands of cheering supporters gave a rousing sendoff to libertarian-leaning Congressman Ron Paul who will retire from active politics next year after losing his latest presidential race to Republican Mitt Romney.</p> <p>The 77-year-old Paul, who has won a legion of fervent supporters, including many among the young, has become a determined thorn in the side of the Republican party by espousing a mix of social liberalism on issues such as foreign policy and deeply conservative beliefs on small government and monetary policy.</p> <p>Just a short drive from the Republican convention which is expected to nominate Romney this week, supporters staged a packed rally in the Sun Dome sports arena on a university campus in northern Tampa.</p> <p>Paul said he had started a revolution in two-party US politics. \"Their philosophy \u2026 is failing. They need something different,\" Paul said. He treated the audience to a trademark rousing condemnation of economic policy and calls to bring American troops home and slash the role of government. \"The people right now are waking and realising the failure of what we have,\" he said.</p> <p>Paul has served 12 terms in congress and made several unsuccessful presidential runs. His latest bid ended in failure to win a single state and defeat to Romney.</p> <p>Paul's supporters then tried to exploit arcane party rules to get as many Tampa convention delegates as they could, which stirred heated emotions, leading to court battles in some states and even physical injury and arrests in Louisiana. However, the bid to upset Romney's Tampa plans was largely stymied by party leaders and their legal teams.</p> <p>Unlike the highly controlled plans for the Tampa convention, the Sun Dome gathering of Paul supporters was a curious blend of libertarian Woodstock, a revivalist meeting and serious academic politics lectures. It featured songs, speeches and tributes galore.</p> <p>Singer Jordan Page belted out two country-sounding songs about Paul, leading the crowd in chants of \"Ron Paul! Ron Paul!\", and guitar legend Jimmy Vaughan played a set.</p> <p>Meanwhile, academic Butler Shaffer of the Ludwig von Mises Institute hailed Paul's firm economic principles even when ridiculed by the Republican establishment and many in the media. \"He is anything but a walking contradiction. Even people who don't like him, even people who feel uncomfortable around him, will say 'At least he's consistent',\" Shaffer said.</p> <p>That is certainly true. Paul's blend of conservatism and libertarianism pleases the extreme right with an intense hostility to the welfare state while also embracing leftist causes \u2013 he is anti-war and in favour of legalising drugs.</p> <p>Given that heady blend, the scenes inside the Sun Dome certainly featured moments unlikely to be seen at Romney's convention. Speakers spoke out against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, booed the mention of social conservative Republican Rick Santorum and cheered the name of alleged WikiLeaks leaker Bradley Manning.</p> <p>Barry Goldwater Jnr, the son of conservative godfather Senator Barry Goldwater, brought people cheering to their feet by ending his speech with the words: \"I take life with a grain of salt, a lick of lemon and a shot of tequila.\" South Carolina state senator Tom Davis had the entire arena roaring on its feet when he called Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke \"a traitor and a dictator\".</p> <p>A possible inheritor of Paul's movement is Rand Paul, Paul's son and a Senator from Kentucky. Rand Paul introduced his father and won chants of \"Paul 16! Paul 16!\" from the crowd, urging him to run for president embracing his father's ideas in 2016.</p> <p>But as he leaves the political stage, Paul has certainly seen some of his ideas come into the mainstream. The rise of the Tea Party has galvanised his anti-government stance and views once considered extreme \u2013 auditing the Federal Reserve and returning to the gold standard to set the dollar's value, for example \u2013 are making inroads into the Republican agenda. \"You are changing the party,\" said Michigan congressman Justin Amash, who added that the \"liberty movement\" would still flourish despite Paul's retirement. \"There is no next Ron Paul. Ron Paul is one of a kind. But there are many new champions,\" Amash said.</p> <p>Those champions are unlikely to include Romney. Indeed, it was had to find many Paul people with anything good to say about Romney.</p> <p>Russ Chastain, 43, a Florida native in attendance, said the rally would help galvanise Ron Paul supporters now facing a future without their main leader. \"I don't know what will happen. It is easy to get disheartened but that is what this event is about. It is encouraging for people,\" he said. And would he be voting for Romney in the November election? \"I don't think I can. He is just like Obama. He's for big government, big debt and perpetual war.\"</p>",

The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Interchange_Format\" title=\"\">Graphics Interchange Format</a> was first developed by CompuServe in 1987, to allow for the quick downloading of highly compressed colour images. It also supported animation, which eventually became its defining feature, particularly the repeating animations introduced with the Netscape Navigator 2.0 browser. In the beginning Gifs were largely confined to either <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rotating_earth_%28large%29.gif\" title=\"\">rotating</a> things or <a href=\"http://netanimations.net/moving_animated_fire_explosion_animations.htm#.UDduTb9y9E4\" title=\"\">flaming</a> things, but they quickly became more complex.</p> <p>By the turn of the century the Gif had become distinctly unfashionable, but within a few years its retro appeal (Gifs often retain the look of a well-thumbed flip book) and simplicity (anyone can make their own these days; well, not me) saw a resurgence in popularity. What was the height of naffness at the end of the web 1.0 era is now a cool, lo-fi mode of self-expression. Thanks largely to the rise of Tumblr, the humble file format has become a form. These days Gifs range from small, repeating film grabs embedded into <a href=\"http://jezebel.com/5935800/alice-coopers-advice-for-how-to-get-a-job-just-get-a-really-good-job-or-be-alice-cooper\" title=\"\">blogs</a> as a sort of illustrative punctuation, to the spectral <a href=\"http://cinemagraphs.com/\" title=\"\">Cinemagraphs</a> of Jamie Beck and Kevin Burg.

  "<p>It may sometimes be tempting to dismiss the Conservatives in Britain as, at heart and in gut, a radical, government slashing, tax cutting, culturally reactionary party committed to dismantling everything about the welfare state and the social market. There are certainly some Tories who flirt, and more, with such ideas, though most of them don't have much influence in government. But in most of the party, sometimes uneasily, these impulses are held in check, especially at the top, by overwhelming political and economic realities.</p> <p>If, though, you want to see a party that really is all these things and proud of it, look across the ocean to the US Republicans, <a href=\"http://www.gopconvention2012.com/\" title=\"\">who meet in Tampa this week</a>, tropical storms permitting, to endorse Mitt Romney as their challenger to Barack Obama in November. If it's radical rightwing politics you want, then <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/25/republican-convention-romney-radical-right?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">the Republicans of the post-Tea Party era</a> embody them. Politically speaking, it's a different world.</p> <p>Going into their 2012 convention, the Republicans are a party in which there is no significant internal division over the claim that taxes must be slashed, that all government programmes other than defence must be cut, that the government economic stimulus should be undone, the federal pension system privatised, the federal healthcare insurance law abolished, that climate change is a hoax, that a high wall should be built along America's southern border, that abortion in all but the tiniest exceptions should be a crime, that gun control laws are a threat to freedom, that civil partnerships and gay marriage should be outlawed, that Iran's nuclear programme should be destroyed and more Jewish settlements encouraged in the occupied Palestinian territories. Oh, and a lot of them still think Mr Obama isn't really an American too, while Mr Romney is a member of a church that believes Jesus travelled to America.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/talk/comment/2012/08/27/120827taco_talk_cassidy\" title=\"\">How far Mr Romney himself really believes many of these things</a> may still, on some level, be an unknown. One of the important questions of the week will be the precise positions he stakes out on these and other crucial questions when he accepts the nomination on Thursday. <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21560864\" title=\"\">While he was governor of Massachusetts</a> \u2013 less than 10 years ago \u2013 he supported abortion, gun control, health insurance and tackling climate change. Now he opposes them. In the recent past, Mr Romney has tried to present himself as a successful practical businessman who can get the American economy moving. But the reality now is that he has embraced his party's radical right, especially by nominating <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/15/paul-ryan-paradox-us-politics\" title=\"\">Congressman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin as his running-mate</a>.</p> <p>Barring any surprise disclaimers this week, this embrace shows just how wide the political ocean separating America from Europe now is. The gulf has long been obvious on issues such as climate change, gay equality, the death penalty and abortion. Now, though, it seems just as wide on economic policy too. Both Mr Romney and Mr Ryan, like all European politicians of the right, and many of the left too, claim to be in favour of cutting their government deficits. But it's only the Republicans who propose to slash every bit of government spending except for defence. And it's only the Republicans who not only refuse to even consider raising taxes (which are comparatively extremely low) to balance the budget, but who also want to cut those taxes further across the board. Mr Ryan wants a tax system with just two bands, 10% and 25%, and would abolish most of the meagre taxes on things like dividends, capital gains and inheritance <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/colbert-king-time-for-mitt-romney-to-come-clean-on-his-taxes/2012/08/24/0a2ddb4c-ee0b-11e1-b0eb-dac6b50187ad_story.html\" title=\"\">which are almost the only ones</a> that people like Mr Romney (who paid 13.9% of his multimillion-dollar income in taxes in 2010) actually pay.</p> <p>In the global financial crisis, all incumbents are unusually vulnerable. <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/us/general_election_romney_vs_obama-1171.html\" title=\"\">Mr Obama's poll lead is narrow, too</a>. The convention in Tampa is important because a Republican win in November would be a domestic disaster for America. But if it shows that the political gulf within the US is getting wider, it also shows that the gulf between America and the rest of the developed world is widening even more.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Tuesday</strong><br></h2> <p><strong>Rick Santorum</strong>, Romney's closest challenger for the Republican nomination, is scheduled to speak at the convention in the evening. The two shared a charged battle for nomination after Santorum won Iowa, the first state on the primary trail. <strong>Ann Romney</strong> will also speak. The presidential hopeful's staff hope she can expand his appeal among female voters, where the former Massachusetts governor has fallen well behind Obama. <strong>Chris Christie</strong> will be the main speaker of the day. The popular New Jersey governor is known for his straight-talking style and was many people's preference for the vice-presidency.</p> <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <p><strong>John McCain</strong>, who beat Romney to the party's nomination in 2008, will open proceedings, followed by <strong>Jeb Bush</strong>, the former Florida governor and brother of George W. The two Republican heavyweights have broad appeal, so Romney will be keen to get their enthusiastic backing. <strong>Condoleezza Rice</strong>, secretary of state under George W Bush, is also lined up to speak. <strong>Paul Ryan</strong>, Romney's running mate, will give the main speech, formally accepting the candidacy. The youthful Wisconsin congressman is best known for his budget plan: supporters say he will try to rein in the deficit; opponents say he will gut benefit plans such as Medicare.</p> <h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> <p><strong>Marco Rubio</strong>, the Florida senator and son of Cuban parents, is popular among both members of the Tea Party and Hispanics and, like many others on this list, was touted as a potential running mate for Romney. The convention closes with Mitt Romney's acceptance speech. It will be up to the candidate to reach beyond the diehard Republicans in the convention centre and engage with the swing voters watching at home on television to consolidate his slight lead over Obama on the economy \u2013 and do something about his <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/08/26/cnn-poll-which-candidate-cares-more-about-you/\" title=\"\">lukewarm appeal </a>to women and middle class voters.</p>",
  "<p>Even the weather appears to be against Mitt Romney. After a summer in which one thing after another has gone wrong for the Republican presidential challenger, this was to have been his big week, the chance to hit the reset button and to secure a commanding lead that would take him all the way to the White House.</p> <p>But tropical storm Isaac appears to have other ideas. Working its way up from Cuba through the Florida Keys and threatening to turn into a full-blown hurricane, the weather system presents enough of a threat to low-lying coastal Tampa to cause Republicans to cancel Monday's opening of their party convention. There is an outside chance that Tuesday and Wednesday may be disrupted too.</p> <p>The National Hurricane Centre said the worst of the storm is expected to remain west of Tampa, but later in the week the \"combination of a storm surge and the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters\". It added that in the Tampa Bay area the water could flood to between 1 metre and 1.5 metres (3ft to 5ft) deep.</p> <p>At the centre where the Republican convention is to be held, hotel staff were stockpiling sandbags just in case. Secret service staff in charge of security were taking down tents set up for screening delegates on the way into the convention.</p> <p>A concert for early arrivals on Sunday night by Lynyrd Skynyrd, a group best known for the southern anthem Sweet Home Alabama and whose frontman Johnny Van Zant is a Romney supporter, was cancelled because of the storm.</p> <p>The Democrats had planned some diversionary tactics of their own to disrupt the convention, including sending vice-president Joe Biden to Tampa on Monday and elsewhere in Florida on Tuesdaytomorrow. This too has been abandoned.</p> <p>However, Barack Obama's campaign still managed to get a hit in. To the embarrassment of Republicans, former Republican governor Charlie Crist endorsed Obama in an editorial for a Tampa paper.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395240829\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/8/26/1345991227749/Hurricane-Isaac-path-008.png\" alt=\"Hurricane Isaac path\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hurricane Isaac path Photograph: Graphic</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In spite of the storm, Romney's campaign team insisted the convention would not be a washout. \"We will absolutely be able to get our message out,\" said Russ Schriefer, a Romney campaign adviser who is overseeing the convention programme. \"We absolutely think we can do it in three [days].\"</p> <p>Each day of the convention had been regarded as vital in building up a profile of Romney, who is still largely unknown to many Americans, culminating in his speech on Thursday evening which is expected to attract 20-30 million television viewers. Romney has been running neck-and-neck in the polls with Obama for months \u2013 the incumbent holds a 1% lead nationally \u2013 and he needs to break out this week, to establish a poll bounce of about 5% and hope that he can hold that through to the White House election on 6 November.</p> <p>The bounce will only come if Romney secures plenty of prime-time television coverage of his speech, and the host of Republican stars talking him up. In short, he needs the TV crews covering thunderous outbreaks inside the building, not outside.</p> <p>The convention will be formally opened on Monday and immediately adjourned until Tuesday. Monday's campaign theme was going to be \"we can do better\". Romney was also going to pass the magic number of 1,144 delegates, the majority needed to formally secure the party's presidential nomination. A host of party luminaries lined up to speak will be moved to alternative slots later.</p> <p>The Republicans also lost the first day of their 2008 convention, in Minneapolis-St Paul. The circumstances were different, though. The Twin Cities were not threatened by the weather, but the presidential candidate John McCain felt it was insensitive to begin the convention as a hurricane was bearing down on New Orleans, with misplaced fears that its defences might again be breached.</p> <p>Week after week over the summer Romney has seen his campaign plans disrupted. The Obama campaign forced him on the defensive over his time as chief executive of Bain Capital, the company where he made his fortune.</p> <p>He also made gaffes, including his criticism of the planning for the London Olympics. Then there were party allies who have let him down, such as senate candidate Todd Akin, who offended just about as many people as it is possible to offend with his \"legitimate rape\" comment last week.</p> <p>The decision to hold the convention in Florida was taken when Michael Steele was Republican chairman. Steele was unpopular, but he is unrepentant about the Florida decision, telling his critics through the Politico website that it was a joint decision with other party officials. His critics \u2013 and saying they \"just need to stop that shit, ok, get over it\".</p> <p>The Republicans had good reason for choosing Florida: it is one of the top three swing states that could decide the White House race. Taking the convention to Florida increases the party's profile in the state.</p> <p>But it was always going to be a gamble holding it in the hurricane season, one that Romney and the Republicans have already lost.</p>",
  "<p>Republican presidential hope Mitt Romney hit back on the issue of healthcare on Sunday, defending his record as state governor while attempting to use the president's own words against him in a new attack ad.</p> <p>In a growing indication that both campaign teams are seeking to make the running on the issue, Romney said he was \"very proud\" of the healthcare system he introduced to Massachusetts, while claiming that Barack Obama would strip $700bn from Medicare.</p> <p>It comes a day after Obama used to his weekly radio address to slam his opponents for wanting to turn the much-cherished insurance safety net for seniors into a \"voucher system\" that would \"effectively end Medicare as we know it\".</p> <p>The addition of Paul Ryan to the Republican White House ticket, as Romney's vice-presidential pick, has moved the issue of healthcare to the centre of the election campaign.</p> <p>Democrats claim that swingeing cuts envisaged in a budget blueprint from the conservative House representative would gut Medicare.</p> <p>But in an interview with Fox News Sunday, Romney touted his own record on healthcare while attempting to bat away suggestions that his party was anti-women.</p> <p>\"With regards to women's healthcare, I'm the guy who was able to get healthcare for all of the women and men in my state.\"</p> <p>He added that he able to do so \"without cutting Medicare and without raising taxes\".</p> <p>It marks a relatively rare foray into a defence of so-called Romneycare \u2013 the Massachusetts system that many have noted for its similarity to provisions in Obama's landmark healthcare reforms.</p> <p>As well as defending his own record, the Republican candidate also went on the offensive, on the issue, again claiming that the president planned to strip $700bn from Medicare.</p> <p>A new attack ad rolled out by his campaign on Sunday quotes Obama in 2008 criticising his then presidential rival John McCain for planning a $882bn cut from the programme.</p> <p>\"What would candidate Obama say about President Obama's Medicare cuts?\" it then asks before playing a clip of Obama saying \"it ain't right\".</p>",

Currently secretary general of the party, Cop\u00e9, who for years was one of Sarkozy's fiercest rivals within the party, delivered a staunch speech evoking his childhood and love of France.</p> <p>While Sarkozy once famously described himself as a \"mixed blood\" Frenchman, Cop\u00e9 spoke of his own foreign roots and Jewish family, who were hidden by a French family during the concentration camp round-ups in 1943.</p> <p>He said \"a French flame burned in me\" from a young age and that he was raised in the \"cult of France\".</p> <p>A lawyer, MP and mayor of Meaux, just outside Paris, he was a champion of France's ban on the niqab, or Muslim full-face veil, and is seen as staunchly on the right of the party.</p> <p>He sees himself as a crusader of the right, has figurines of Zorro and Napoleon on his desk and has been called arrogant by his detractors. Nicknamed JFC and known for his electric keyboard gigs, he vowed in his speech to head an unabashed right, \"with no complexes\", which would be strong in its opposition to the left and political correctness.</p> <p>Further north, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, Sarkozy's former prime minister and currently favourite in the polls, confirmed his bitter rivalry to Cop\u00e9 by presiding over a rural spit-roast with supporters. Fillon's summer campaigning has been limited after he broke his foot in a motorbike accident in Capri while staying with the chairman of the Italian motoring giant Ferrari, a reminder of Sarkozy-style holidays. But he and Cop\u00e9 have still managed to snipe at each other via allies and the press.</p> <p>Fillon, 58, a Gaullist, has played on his image as what supporters say is an experienced and calming political statesman. He recently described himself as more serene and pragmatic than Sarkozy, saying the former president once complained he was too prudent. This prompted Cop\u00e9 to question the value of prudence in politics.</p> <p>A recent Ifop poll found 48% of UMP supporters want Fillon to lead the party, compared with 24% for Cop\u00e9. But only party members can vote in the November ballot and Cop\u00e9's supporters say he has more sway over the party apparatus.</p> <p>Behind the battle to lead the UMP \u2013 a broad coalition party of moderate centrists and rightwingers created by Jacques Chirac in 2002 \u2013 is the key issue of who will be the right's presidential candidate in 2017. Although the new party president will not automatically become presidential candidate, whoever wins the leadership vote in November will be in pole position.</p> <p>The ghost of Sarkozy hangs over the race. One poll this month showed 53% of UMP supporters wanted Sarkozy to return and run again for president in 2017. Although his allies say this is highly unlikely, the party base has been displaying a marked \"Sarkostalgia\", with 2,000 gathering in Nice this weekend for a Friends of Sarkozy meeting in his honour. Both Cop\u00e9 and Fillon have been competing over who can lay claim to being closest to Sarkozy's ideas and standing.</p> <p>The divided and weakened UMP is faced with rebuilding itself locally and electorally. The French left now controls the presidency, parliament and senate, as well as the regions and most big cities. The rise of the far-right Front National and its ideas have sparked bitter rows within the UMP about where to place itself in the national&#xa0;debate.</p> <h2>The UMP's other rising stars</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395236291\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/26/1346000735094/Nathalie-Kosciusko-Morize-002.jpg\" alt=\"Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet.

She has been trying to undo her reputation as bourgeois and aloof, made worse by an election radio appearance when asked the price of a Paris metro ticket she said \u20ac4 instead of \u20ac1.70. She has promised a \"third way\" for the party and spent the summer campaigning across France in a caravan dubbed the NKM-mobile. Asked about the difficulty in getting 8,000 party backers, something easy for the two party bigwigs leading the race, she said: \"I'm not going to get involved in a contest over who can pee the furthest.\"</p> <p><strong>Bruno Le Maire</strong></p> <p>The 43-year-old who was Europe minister then agriculture minister under Sarkozy is tipped as an important new face in a party which he says is in dire need of renewal. Staunchly pro-Europe, and at ease speaking English and German, he declared his UMP leadership bid this month but is polling at around 2%. This month he is to publish his first novel based on the life of the Austrian conductor, Carlos Kleiber.</p> <p><strong>Xavier Bertrand</strong></p> <p>Sarkozy's former health minister, and one-time secretary general of the UMP, the MP and mayor, 47, is yet to declare his bid. He has played the card of the provincial outsider with good networks in the party machine.</p> <p><strong>Christian Estrosi</strong></p> <p>A former grand prix motorcycle racer, the hardline mayor of Nice is a staunch Sarkozy supporter, who recently co-founded the group Friends of Sarkozy. He has yet to formalise his bid and remains an outsider in the leadership contest.</p>",
  "<p>To the four people sitting in church at a Tampa suburb, coming to the Republican national convention to protest Mitt Romney felt deeply personal, not just political.</p> <p>For all of them are workers at an Illinois car parts factory whose parent firm Sensata is majority-owned by Bain Capital, the company once run by Romney and in which he still has millions of dollars of investments.</p> <p>Now their plant in the small town of Freeport is being closed and<br>shipped piece by piece to China.</p> <p>They have trained their Chinese replacements, watched colleagues get laid off and by the end of the year they will have lost their jobs too.</p> <p>They want Romney to know about it. So they have come to Tampa to join protests aimed at highlighting his links to Bain and outsourcing American jobs overseas.</p> <p>They want to tell their stories and put a human face on the issue.</p> <p>\"I think people can relate to our story,\" said Cheryl Randecker, 52, as she sat in a chair in a church building that is serving as a \"base\" for a variety of protest groups in Tampa.</p> <p>Tom Gaulrapp agreed. He and some other Sensata workers have already been tailing the Romney campaign around the Midwest.</p> <p>They have pitched up at Romney headquarters in Wisconsin and in Iowa, trying to ask him to use his influence at Bain to save their jobs and stop their factory from being sent overseas.</p> <p>At Bain's Illinois headquarters they delivered a petition with 35,000 signatures. So far they have had no response from Romney or Bain, but have had the police called to remove<br>them.</p> <p>Gaulrapp also tried to speak to Romney at an Iowa rally, standing in the audience and asking him directly if he would come to Freeport and save their jobs.</p> <p>But he was shouted down by the crowd when he asked a question. \"We had people scream at us and call us communists,\" said Gaulrapp.</p> <p>Romney has spoken out against outsourcing American jobs overseas and<br>claimed that his management experience in private enterprise at the head of Bain will help kick-start the economy and create new jobs.</p> <p>But the Sensata workers from Freeport believe they know different. Bain's involvement in their lives, they say, has ended up with their jobs being shipped out in order to save costs, despite the fact that they say their factory is high-tech and profitable.</p> <p>So far the Romney campaign has not commented on their plight, only issuing the statement: \"Governor Romney is not familiar with this issue and has not been involved in the management of Bain since 1999.\" Bain has refused any comment.</p> <p>All put together the four workers in Tampa \u2013 which includes Joanne Penniston and Bonnie Borman \u2013 have some 96 years of experience working in the soon-to-be-shuttered factory.</p> <p>They say that sort of expertise is being lost alongside the hurt and pain caused to families suddenly bereft of a decent middle class income. Before they arrived in Tampa a group of neighbours and fellow workers back in Freeport held a \"potluck\" dinner to send them on their way.</p> <p>\"They wished us well and hoped we could make a change,\" said Randecker.</p> <p>They know that is unlikely. A wave of fresh 60-day notice letters just went out at the factory.</p> <p>At least three of the four expect their own notice letters in the next week or so. But at least telling their story they hope to perhaps stop such events in the future.</p> <p>\"It plays into peoples fears. They see what's happening to us and they fear it can happen to them. If this doesn't stop there won't be any good jobs left in America, not just Freeport,\" said Gaulrapp.</p>",
  "<p>They have dubbed it \"Romneyville\" but the name is not meant as a compliment to the Republican grandee shortly to be nominated as the party's presidential candidate.</p> <p>Instead the rag-tag denizens of this makeshift encampment of homeless people, leftist activists and protesters are determined to be a thorn in the Republican party's side as the GOP's national convention unfolds.</p> <p>City officials have tried to evict the protesters, who are collected in several buses, cars and a score of tents outside on a patch of gravel just outside Tampa's downtown \u2013 and just inside a restricted \"event zone\" declared by the host city.</p> <p>But their efforts failed on a technicality and now occupants of the camp are determined to go ahead with a series of unauthorised marches and protests to herald the start of the convention.</p> <p>\"I don't believe in zoning free speech. That's censorship. If you are law abiding and peaceful than you should be able to address your government,\" said camp organiser Cheri Honkala, an anti-poverty campaigner and the Green Party's nominee for vice-president in the 2012 election.</p> <p>Honkala is also the co-founder of the Poor People's Economic Human Rights Campaign, which is the main driving force behind the encampment which was begun in May.</p> <p>The group rented the lot, situated just outside an army-navy general store beside the main freeway exit into downtown Tampa, making it a certain sight to the thousands of Republicans and media pouring into the city each day.</p> <p>Among those on view will be Elijah Seabrookes, 56, who arrived in Florida in recent weeks after failing to find work in his native New York.</p> <p>He is now living out of a tent on the lot alongside Occupy movement protesters, Green Party members and the homeless and down-on-their-luck.</p> <p>\"I came here because I wanted to find a home and a job. But I found that there was neither. So now I am living in a tent here,\" said the former security guard.</p> <p>Organisers say the name \"Romneyville\" is meant to play on the \"Hooverville\" settlements that sprung up during the Great Depression.</p> <p>\"We want to show that the 'P Word' is not a curse word. With that word being 'poverty',\" said Bruce Wright, one of the campaign's organisers.</p> <p>The group also plans to protest at the Democratic convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, but the Republican gathering in Tampa is all that is on their minds now. \"It is a right-wing extremist party and we want to show people that,\" Wright added.</p>",
  "<p>The last time a British prime minister endorsed an American president's plans for military intervention, it resulted in the US invasion of Iraq \u2013 one of the worst foreign policy blunders in recent American history.</p> <p>That is why last week's endorsement by David Cameron of a warning by Barack Obama that even the threat of chemical weapons by Syria could trigger a military intervention should be viewed with alarm on both sides of the Atlantic.</p> <p>There is something in the psyche of Americans that gives British views on foreign policy more credit than they deserve. If the Brits say it is so, it must be so is the common reaction of many Americans to pronouncements by British leaders. Americans are inclined to believe their friends across the Atlantic, given their centuries of involvement with countries around the world, have acquired skills to deal with foreign policy issues that Americans \u2013 with barely a century of global domination \u2013 simply do not possess. This is simply not true.</p> <p>While there may be some truth to this belief in British prowess in dealing with other countries, there is an overriding reason to not give British support too much credence: The UK's support is rarely based on facts on the ground and objective analysis. It is driven instead by a self-serving exaggerated view of the \"special relationship\" with the United States.</p> <p>I have always believed that former President Bush would have had a very difficult time selling his unilateral invasion of Iraq to Americans had Prime Minister Blair refused to support American military plans.</p> <p>Why then would Britain, America's closest ally, the co-inventor of modern Iraq, with intimate knowledge of, and deep historical ties to, the Middle East, and with its powerful understanding of Arabs and Islam, not have influenced its American ally's actions more wisely?</p> <p>Dean Acheson, one of America's most gifted Secretaries of State, would have had a ready explanation for why it was not in Britain's best interest to oppose the United States' plans to invade Iraq.</p> <p>Addressing a student conference at the US military academy, West Point, in 1962, he presciently said, \"Great Britain has lost an empire and has not yet found a role. The attempt to play a separate power role, that is, a role apart from Europe, a role based primarily on a 'special relationship' with the United States \u2026 is about played out.\"</p> <p>The American invasion of Iraq destroyed the delicate balance of power relationships involving Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Sunni, Shia, and Kurd. A balance that Iraq's ruthless dictator had maintained for years.</p> <p>A precipitate collapse of the Assad regime in Syria would magnify this instability in the heart of the Middle East by, for instance, encouraging a push by Syrian Kurds for an independent Kurdish State \u2013 the worst nightmare of Turkey, one of America's closest allies in the Middle East. That is why Turkey, the country most affected by the mayhem in Syria (over 200,000 refugees have crossed into it for safety), is politically divided about militarily intervening in Syria.</p> <p>And, American military involvement in Syria, would further damage the relationship between the United States and Russia, Syria's benefactor. That would doom American and Nato plans to remove US troops and material from the war in Afghanistan through Central Asia and Russia; leaving Pakistan as the only route out of the Afghan quagmire. Is that in American national interest?</p> <p>If Britain wants to help re-engineer Syria, a country it helped to invent in the first place, it should be free to do so. But Americans would be wise to make it clear to their elected officials that they have no wish to intervene on one side of a civil war. America has other priorities for its blood and treasure, and they do not include another war in the Middle East.</p> <p>In this closely fought US presidential election season when President Obama is being hammered by conservatives to act militarily in Syria, what the world did not need is a public declaration of UK support for US military intervention in Syria. The US has been down this road before, in Iraq. Does anyone really want to repeat that movie?</p>",

  "<p>Neil Armstrong was a hero \"not just of his time, but of all time\", President Barack Obama said Saturday as he led tributes to the former astronaut.</p> <p>The death of Armstrong at the age of 82 was met by a wave of eulogies as people paid respect to both the man and his achievements as a space pioneer.</p> <p>NASA administrator Charles Bolden commented: \"As long as there are history books, Neil Armstrong will be included in them,\" while fellow Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin said he was \"very saddened\" to hear of the death of a \"good friend\".</p> <p>Armstrong, not a man usually inclined to get involved in politics, was known to be critical of the current White House administration's space policy. But Obama put such differences aside Saturday in a lavish tribute to the man who first set foot on the moon's surface.</p> <p>In a statement, the president said: \"Neil was among the greatest of American heroes \u2013 not just of his time, but of all time.\" He said that the the crew of the Apollo 11 mission in 1969 \"carried with them the aspirations of an entire nation\".</p> <p>\"When Neil stepped foot on the surface of the moon for the first time, he delivered a moment of human achievement that will never be forgotten,\" Obama added.</p> <p>Likewise, Obama's Republican challenger for the White House, Mitt Romney, paid tribute to the former astronaut, tweeting: \"Neil Armstrong today takes his place in the hall of heroes. The moon will miss its first son of earth.\"</p> <p>Michael Collins, who flew to the moon alongside Aldrin and Armstrong, described his former colleague as \"the best\", adding: \"I will miss him terribly\".</p> <p>On Twitter, RIP Neil Armstrong was trending within minutes of the news of his death breaking.</p> <p>Rapper Snoop Dogg, who in 2009 teamed-up with Buzz Aldrin to produce the track Rocket Experience commemorating the 40th anniversary of the first lunar landing, was amongst those paying tribute online. \"RIP to my Unk Neil Armstrong!
