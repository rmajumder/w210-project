  "<p>UK Sport, the funding agency for Olympic sport, has turned to the England and Wales Cricket Board to replace the man credited with sparking the revolution that culminated in its best medal haul for a century.</p> <p>Simon Timson, currently head of the England development programme and science and medicine at the ECB, will take over as performance director from Peter Keen, who quit UK Sport after eight years shortly before last summer's Olympics. He will be charged with carrying on from Team GB's best performance in 104 years, when they racked up 65 medals including 29 golds, and secured third in the medal table.</p> <p>The government has already confirmed that UK Sport, which invested \u00a3312m of lottery and exchequer funding in Olympic sport in the four years leading up to the Games, will have its funding maintained for the 2016 Rio cycle. It will announce in December how that money will be allocated under its \"no-compromise funding formula\" that ruthlessly targets investment at those sports most likely to win medals.</p> <p>The UK Sport chief executive, Liz Nicholl, has already claimed that Team GB will become the first host nation to match their medal achievement at the next Olympics, in Rio in four years' time.</p> <p>\"I'm delighted to be taking up this significant leadership role within UK Sport at such an exciting time, with such a strong performance in London to build upon,\" said Timson. \"I feel confident the system possesses the knowledge, expertise and tools required to sustain success and will be looking to the lessons learned from the London cycle, to see where there is room for improvement.\"</p> <p>Timson will take up his role in January. Keen, who started the revolution at British Cycling before joining UK Sport to apply the lessons more widely in 2004, is to stay on in a part-time role as special adviser for performance.</p> <p>Before joining the ECB, where he is credited with introducing a string of performance innovations, Timson was performance director at British Skeleton. His tenure coincided with a run of medals for the sport, and winter sports are likely to be one area of his immediate focus with the Sochi Games looming in 2014.</p> <p>Nicholl said Timson is a \"stand-out candidate\" and his appointment was also welcomed by the sports minister Hugh Robertson. \"Simon Timson has an excellent track record both in high-performance sport and academically in sports science,\" he said. \"His experience as an Olympic performance director as well as his time at the ECB, where he helped England become the best cricket team in the world, will be a big asset to elite sport in the UK as we look to move forward from the fantastic performances at London 2012.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, the only remaining rival to Lord Coe to replace Lord Moynihan as chairman of the British Olympic Association has withdrawn his application. Richard Leman, the former international hockey player who is president of GB Hockey and sits on the BOA board, said he wanted to leave the way clear for Coe to be elected on November 7. Moynihan announced immediately after the London Olympics that he planned to step down a year early.</p> <p>\"Recognising the unique circumstance in which we find ourselves in having the person who led the organisation and delivery of what is widely regarded as the most successful Olympic and Paralympic Games in history standing for election as our next Chair, I have decided to put my full support behind Seb Coe and his candidacy,\" said Leman.</p> <p>\"The opportunities and challenges we face during the next four years are unprecedented, and from my position as a member of Board of Directors, I will continue to work closely with our next Chair, my colleagues on the Board, the National Olympic Committee and our staff to meet those challenges.\"</p>",
  "<p>In the 2012 US presidential election, it is clear the brief age of political blogs shaping the political narrative has passed and we are now in <a href=\"http://blog.twitter.com/2012/08/a-new-barometer-for-election.html\">the era of Twitter</a>. The proof is in Twitter's big role in shaping the coverage and the winners and losers of this month's presidential debates. </p> <p>At a seminar on the influence of social media on the presidential election \u2013 held at the Democrat convention in Charlotte \u2013 Garance Franke-Ruta, a senior editor for the Atlantic, declared:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[The] last cycle was all about blogs and the incremental journalism of blogs. This cycle we have really a Twitter campaign where a lot of the conversation has moved off the blogs onto Twitter especially for political insiders.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Hamish McKenzie, a reporter for the tech site Pandodaily <a href=\"http://pandodaily.com/2012/10/03/heres-what-the-presidential-debate-looked-like-tonight/\">who writes on social media and politics</a>, says political blogs have gone from being the \"first and fast reactors\" to being made \"almost obsolete by Twitter\".</p> <p>Twitter's advocates have big numbers on their side. Adam Sharp, with the barely tweetable job title of \"head of government, news and social innovation\" at Twitter, noted there had been 360,000 total tweets during the two conventions in 2008. The total for both in 2012 was nearly 14m. Mitt Romney's speech peaked at 14,000 tweets per minute. (tpm) Michelle Obama in her convention speech doubled that to 28,000 \u2013 and Barack Obama then took it up to 54,000tpm.</p> <p>The first presidential debate earlier this month smashed those records. There were a total of 10.3m tweets, with the peak of 159,000tpm for moderator Jim Lehrer's \"Let's not\" knockback of a Romney request. Obama's personal record was lifted to 153,000tpm for his \"I had five seconds left\" counter to a Lehrer reminder on time limits.</p> <p>Adam Sharp argues that these numbers are evidence of \"a return to retail politics, the idea that people can be directly engaged in the political process on a one-on-one basis again, not only interacting with the candidate and issues but with one another.\" He claims Twitter is showing the moments when people across the country \"were turning to people next to them on the proverbial global couch and saying, 'Did you see that?'\" Social media is \"measuring for the first time natural conversation \u2026 that a cycle ago would have been behind the closed doors of coffee shops and office water coolers\".</p> <p>While some are skeptical \u2013 McKenzie argues that the number of tweets is a crude gauge, while <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/news/debate_watchers_use_of_social_media_can_create_instantaneous_consensus-218160-1.html\">Carroll Doherty of the Pew Research Centre</a> warns that only 13% of Americans are using Twitter \u2013 everyone agrees that the main impact of Twitter has been to speed up the news cycle.</p> <p>Franke-Ruta gave the example of a 21-minute news cycle, from incident to report to counter-report, all driven by a tweet: Mitt Romney joked that no one had ever asked to see his birth certificate. This was tweeted three minutes later, was on Politico's website after four minutes, video was available on Buzzfeed after five minutes, and the Romney team had a clarifying statement out within 21 minutes. In Sharp's words:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We have shifted from a 24-hours news cycle to a 140-character one.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Twitter has challenged the hallowed status of post-event media punditry, which seems increasingly irrelevant as verdicts are declared long before the talking heads get a turn. Sharp noted that the peak Twitter moment for convention speeches was the minute they ended, as the flow of tweets then tailed off very quickly. The mocking of Clint Eastwood and his empty chair was under way well before the pundits got a word in.</p> <p>Twitter also set the tone for the first presidential debate. Focus groups dialing minute-by-minute responses and post-debate polls all showed Romney winning. But it was liberal comedian Bill Maher's savage Twitter commentary on Obama's flat performance that dominated the early coverage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/billmaher/status/253680489850892289\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-left\" width=\"460\"><p>i can't believe i'm saying this, but Obama looks like he DOES need a teleprompter</p>&mdash; Bill Maher (@billmaher) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/billmaher/status/253680489850892289\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-04T02:18:36+00:00\">October 4, 2012</a></blockquote> <script src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script> </figure>  <p>Obama supporters tried a \"style versus substance\" line in post-debate media appearances, but you could see their hearts weren't in it.</p> <p>Joe Rospars, head of Obama 's digital campaign, argued in Charlotte that Twitter has made \"the elite conversation a much bigger spectacle now\". He wryly noted that previously after a big speech, attention turned to the three or four pundits reacting on each television channel. But now:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"It's not just these people but everyone who has ever been on television all weighing in at once online.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>There is certainly a risk that Twitter will lead to ever faster but shallower politics. Romney's response to the killing of the US ambassador in Benghazi was widely criticized as intemperate, premature and in breach of longstanding protocols of political unity in the face of attacks. <a href=\"http://blog.sfgate.com/nov05election/2012/09/12/analysis-romneys-attack-on-obama-over-libya-assassination-could-backfire/\">John Pitney, a politics professor in California, attributed Romney's response</a> to \"a Twitter-driven media environment [where] candidates feel pressure to react to events immediately\". The Jack Welch tweet questioning the official September job figures triggered off a day of bizarre media coverage on whether official statistics could really be manipulated, as <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/10/jack-welch-conspiracy-jobs-tweet_n_1954176.html\">Welch seemed to claim</a>.</p> <p>Stories emerge faster and burn out faster, while fuller consideration of their importance is lost. Romney's comments on the killing of the US ambassador might have proved his \"3am phone call failure moment,\" according to McKenzie, but the caravan quickly moved on to the \"47%\" observations of Romney from a secretly-taped fundraiser. </p> <p>Helped by the Twitter reaction, Romney's debate win reset the polling numbers, with Obama now clinging to bare leads in some swing states. In the coming debates, it is a sure bet the campaigns will be lining up surrogate tweeters to respond \u2013 and it's likely that the left-leaning ones will be more loyal next time around.</p>",
  "<p>Larry Bushnell is one of the undecideds, that rarefied group of Americans who have yet to make up their minds whom to back on 6 November and whose vote could decide who holds the world's most powerful office.</p> <p>He lives in Ohio, one of the most crucial swing states in the US with its rich crop of 18 electoral college votes. It is often said that as Ohio goes, so goes the US presidency \u2013 it has consistently backed the winning candidate in every presidential election bar one since 1944. Within Ohio, Lake County where Bushnell lives is a bellwether, as it consistently cleaves more closely to the statewide voting pattern <a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/datacentral/index.ssf/2008/08/ohios_presidential_election_be.html\">than anywhere else in the state</a>.</p> <p>Bushnell has yet another distinction as a voter. He belongs to a demographic group that in modern times Democratic presidential candidates, with Barack Obama as no exception, have struggled to bring on board \u2013 white men. In 2008, Obama won just 41% of the total white male vote across the US, a proportion that slumped further to 39% for white men without a college education.</p> <p>Polls this year <a href=\"http://decoded.nationaljournal.com/2012/08/voters-divide-along-familiar-l.php\">show that Mitt Romney</a> has capitalised on the Republican advantage among this demographic in key swing states like Ohio, Colorado, Virginia and Wisconsin, bringing his support among non-college educated white men to about 58%. But Romney also knows how high the stakes are in this state \u2013 his overall poll rating has trailed behind Obama's, and though he has made up much ground in the past 10 days he will be all too familiar with the chilling fact that no Republican has won the US presidency without having also won Ohio.</p> <p>The good news for Obama and Romney is that they still have time to win over Bushnell, a 58-year-old retired manager at a jet engine repairs factory, such is his state of indecision. The bad news is that Bushnell detests both of them.</p> <p>\"I've been online checking them out, and I honestly think they both suck. They'll lie to get your vote,\" he said.</p> <p>Bushnell plumped for Obama in 2008, but is angry that the president has failed, as he sees it, to deliver on his promise of change. He is equally unimpressed by Romney, who he regards a \"coward \u2013 he keeps on flip-flopping from one thing to the next\".</p> <h2>'I'll vote for the guy I think will be better for me'</h2> <p>The Guardian gathered a sample group of five white male voters, Bushnell among them, in this bellwether area within a bellwether state to explore their mood and motivations. Interviewed outside a Home Depot store in Mentor, a small town within Lake County, they also included Roberto Ciora, 57, who has a message that will be pleasing to the Romney camp.</p> <p>In past presidential elections, Ciora has always voted for a third-party candidate, because he says he's so disillusioned with both main parties. But for now Romney has his vote, not so much for positive reasons but because he's the not-Obama candidate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397847816\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/16/1350415380036/ohio-voters--006.jpg\" alt=\"ohio voters \" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roberto Ciora: 'I just go with my gut'.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ciora, a hospital nurse in Cleveland, says he will vote for Romney as a protest against the president. He doesn't like Obama's healthcare reforms \u2013 he thinks they will turn America into Canada \"where you have to wait months to see a doctor\".</p> <p>He also distrusts Obama on running the economy. \"Obama has no business experience \u2013 he's a lawyer. Romney is a businessman who could get the debt under control.\"</p> <p>Mark Luptak, 39, is leaning towards Romney, though not firmly so. Until recently he ran his own plastering business, but the residential housing market was in such doldrums after the 2008 economic crash that he had to shut it down and take a job in a larger commercial firm.</p> <p>The home improvement market is as bad as anything he's seen since the 1980s, and though he voted for Obama in 2008 he has little hope that another four years of his administration will drag it back up. \"I don't know if anything will help right now. The economy is horrible and I don't think that's going to change for years.\"</p> <p>The trade union at the construction firm he has joined is prompting him to vote for Obama. But Luptak says he's minded to swing behind Romney because he thinks a Romney administration would be more friendly to small businesses like the one he used to run.</p> <p>\"Honestly, I don't know. I'm a construction worker \u2013 I just go with my gut. I'll vote for the guy I think will be better for me, I'm selfish like that.\"</p> <h2>Ready to give Obama another chance</h2> <p>The relative faith of Luptak and Ciora in Romney as the best candidate to run the US economy runs in tune with recent polls which have seen the race tightening over the past two weeks in the wake of Romney's confident showing, and Obama's lacklustre one, in the first televised presidential debate on 3 October. Though there is considerable latitude between polls, <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/oh/ohio_romney_vs_obama-1860.html\">the Real Clear Politics tracker survey</a> has Obama ahead by just two points in Ohio \u2013 a statistical tie.</p> <p>Obama's continuing, though slim, edge may have something to do with the fact that his re-election campaign has presented him aggressively as saviour of the American auto industry \u2013 a message conveyed by an avalanche of TV adverts served in the state. Ohio's resurgent car industry, particularly in northern areas of the state like Lake County where parts production factories are concentrated, <a href=\"http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/business/report-11300-new-auto-jobs-in-ohio-since-june-2009/nRCqd/\">has added more than 11,000 jobs since June 2009</a>, helping to bring down the jobless rate to 7.2%, well below the national unemployment rate of 7.8%.</p> <p>John Ferguson, 22, is thinking that he will probably vote for Obama on grounds that the economy, though far from perfect, will be safest in his hands. He works in a fiberglass factory making underground piping. \"I'm one of the lucky ones. I got in somewhere,\" he said.</p> <p>He says he is \"pretty sure\" he'll vote Obama to give him \"another chance. When Obama took over we were billions in debt, and it's pretty much impossible to swing that around in four years.\"</p> <p>Mark Travis, the fifth member of the group, says he is frustrated and upset by all the political banter this year. But he is firm in his position, having already decided that he will put his cross beside Obama's name on 6 November. </p> <p>An entrepreneur, aged 30, Travis said he adheres to many conservative principles but just doesn't trust Romney or the Republicans to follow through. \"The basic truth is that the Republicans don't deliver on what they promise. Neither do the Democrats, but they are a little more dependable.\"</p>",
  "<p>In Tuesday's presidential debate, Mitt Romney and Barack Obama will claim they have opposing visions for America's future. But for all the differences they will put forward, both presidential campaigns have something in common: they are long on pro-family rhetoric, but short on pro-family policies. If the campaigns are serious about <a href=\"http://www.suntimes.com/news/sweet/15721901-452/election-could-come-down-to-what-women-want.html\">getting more women voters in their corner</a>, it's time to step it up. </p> <p>Case in point: neither Romney nor Obama has offered a single policy idea on the campaign trail that would ease the burden of working families who are juggling demanding work schedules with care for children and elderly parents. And neither the presidential nor vice-presidential debates even mentioned the economic stresses that women, in particular, are facing today. </p> <p>Instead, in August, both party conventions shone the spotlight on candidates' wives, who made emotional appeals about family life. <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/08/28/160216442/transcript-ann-romneys-convention-speech\">Ann Romney spoke</a> of \"the working moms who love their jobs but would like to work just a little less to spend more time with the kids.\" <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/09/04/160578836/transcript-michelle-obamas-convention-speech\">Michelle Obama recalled</a> her husband's mother turning to her own parents for help in raising her children. </p> <p>Yet, neither mentioned the value of public support for the services that millions of families need, but cannot afford: high-quality, out-of-home care for young children, after-school programs for older children and long-term care services for family members coping with disability, or with the frailties that come with aging. Neither mentioned the need for laws that would enable millions of workers to reconcile the responsibilities of working for pay and caregiving at home: paid parental leave, paid sick leave, tax credits that could help support family care, or anti-discrimination protections for working women and men with caregiving responsibilities at home. Neither mentioned the many paid care workers who earn inadequate wages and lack their own workplace rights and benefits. </p> <p>Women voters respond to messages about economic security, <a href=\"http://www.suntimes.com/news/sweet/15721901-452/election-could-come-down-to-what-women-want.html\">experts say</a>. And with Romney <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-10-07/romney-trounced-obama-in-presidential-debate-newt-gingrich-says\">beginning to close in on Obama's lead among women</a>, the competition to secure their support is getting fierce. It's a perfect opening for serious policy proposals around caregiving, work-life balance and family policy.</p> <p>In principle, differences between Democrats and Republicans are stark. The 2012 Democratic party platform emphasizes the importance of walking the walk when it comes to family values \u2013 and underscores the value of caregiving at home, as well as in the marketplace. The platform calls for passing the <a href=\"http://www.democrats.org/democratic-national-platform\">Healthy Families Act</a>, which would provide paid sick leave, and broadening the Family and Medical Leave Act to grant more unpaid leave for caregiving. By contrast, the <a href=\"http://www.gop.com/2012-republican-platform_we/\">Republican party platform</a> calls for cuts in public spending and fails to specify any particular tax cuts aimed at helping parents or other caregivers. </p> <p>But in practice, these political differences have been rendered almost irrelevant by a stalemate over deficit reduction. </p> <p>One way to break that stalemate is to make a stronger case for caring about care. Much of the money and time devoted to young children and adults who need long-term assistance represents a family necessity. As a result, cuts in programs aimed to help families may reduce public debt, but they increase private debt. In many cases, short-run savings come at the cost of lower long-run productivity. </p> <p>Further complicating the picture, the quality of care that Americans are able to provide their families varies dramatically depending on household income. The affluent enjoy more workplace flexibility and are able to purchase high-quality childcare and elder care services, while low-income families often linger on waiting lists or rely on public programs such as Medicaid. Middle-income families frequently face the most limited options because they lack the resources to buy private care, yet earn too much to qualify for public programs. </p> <p>And while both parties have repeatedly reminded us of America's exceptionalism, when it comes to care, our country is exceptional for all the wrong reasons. Out of 20 high-income countries:</p> <p>\u2022 Only the US has <a href=\"http://www.workingmother.com/best-companies/everyone-us-state-maternity-leave\">no national policy</a> of paid maternity leave in the wake of birth or adoption. As a result, millions of American women are forced choose between returning to paid work before it is feasible, or taking a leave and absorbing an income loss when they need that income most. </p> <p>\u2022 Only the US has <a href=\"http://dissentmagazine.org/online.php?id=634\">no national policy</a> giving workers a right to paid sick days. As a result, many employees routinely go to work when they or their children are ill.</p> <p>\u2022 The US <a href=\"http://dissentmagazine.org/online.php?id=634\">invests the smallest share</a> of public spending in early childhood education and care, constraining parents' employment options and leaving countless children with inadequate childcare. </p> <p>\u2022 Only the US has <a href=\"http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/labor/news/2012/08/16/12031/fact-sheet-paid-sick-days/\">no national policy</a> guaranteeing workers a minimum number of paid days off each year, resulting in our nation having among the longest annual employment hours in the world.</p> <p>Those skeptical of European examples point to the debt crisis in Greece and Spain. But most of the countries in northern and western Europe that provide generous support for caregiving are doing as well, or better, than the US in economic terms. Countries like Denmark, Sweden and Norway all have <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/21d103cc-e6c3-11e1-af33-00144feab49a.html\">much lower debt-to-GDP ratios</a> than the US does.</p> <p>Our country needs a national care policy that would help support families wherever they live, and whatever their income. Americans nationwide are standing up and demanding an audience from political leaders and policy-makers. And the <a href=\"http://www.caringeconomy.org/content/questions-for-candidates\">Caring Economy Campaign</a> has crafted a set of questions for the presidential candidates that directly asks them what policies they propose to help support both paid and unpaid care.</p> <p>We need to ask the candidates again and again until we get clear answers. If we don't, we will never know how much they really care. And many women's votes will remain up for grabs.</p>",
  "<p>The way the two major parties control the presidential debates is a perfect microcosm of how political debates are restricted in general. Though typically shrouded in secrecy, several facts about this process have recently come to light and they are quite instructive. </p> <p>I was on Democracy Now this morning along with George Farah discussing the ways these debates, designed to cast the appearance of fostering vibrant exchanges, are actually intended to constrict the range of debated views as much as possible. My segment (and the transcript to it) can be seen <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2012/10/16/glenn_greenwald_presidential_debates_highlight_faux\">here</a>, but it was <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2012/10/16/secret_debate_contract_reveals_obama_and\">the commentary of Farah</a> - who is a genuine expert in the history of presidential debates - that I found revealing.</p> <p>He described how the two political parties in the 1990s joined forces to wrest control over the presidential debates away from the independent League of Women Voters, which had long resisted the parties' efforts to shield their presidential candidates from genuine surprise or challenge. Now run by the party-controlled Commission on Presidential Debates, these rituals are designed to do little more than \" eliminate spontaneity\" and \"exclude all viable third-party voices\". Citing a <a href=\"http://thepage.time.com/2012/10/15/the-complete-m-o-u/\">just-leaked 21-page \"memorandum of understanding\"</a> secretly negotiated by the two campaigns to govern the rules of the debates, Farah recounted:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We have a private corporation that was created by the Republican and Democratic parties called the Commission on Presidential Debates. It seized control of the presidential debates precisely because the League was independent, precisely because this women's organization had the guts to stand up to the candidates that the major-party candidates had nominated. And instead of making public these contracts and resisting the major-party candidates' manipulations, the commission allows the candidates to negotiate these 21-page contracts that dictate all the fundamental terms of the debates.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Gawker's John Cook has <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5951977/leaked-debate-agreement-shows-both-obama-and-romney-are-sniveling-cowards\">an excellent breakdown</a> of the 21-page memo. In his piece, entitled \"Leaked Debate Agreement Shows Both Obama and Romney are Sniveling Cowards\", Cook details how the rules imposed on these debates demonstrate that, above all else, \"both campaigns are terrified at anything even remotely spontaneous happening.\" </p> <p>Under this elaborate regime, the candidates \"aren't permitted to ask each other questions, propose pledges to each other, or walk outside a 'predesignated area.'\" Worse, \"the audience members posing questions aren't allowed to ask follow-ups (their mics will be cut off as soon as they get their questions out). Nor will moderator Candy Crowley.\" The rules even \"forbid television coverage from showing reaction shots of the candidates\". </p> <p>All of this means, as Farah put it:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>\"The town hall debate we're going to see tonight is the most constrained and regulated town hall debate in presidential debate history. The first town hall debate was introduced in 1992, and no one knew what anyone was going to ask, none of the audience members were going to ask. The moderator could ask any follow-up questions. It was exciting, and it was real.</p> <p>\"Well, President George H.W. Bush stumbled in response to an oddly worded question about the federal deficit, and the candidates - the campaigns have panicked and have attempted to avoid that kind of situation from happening again. In 1996, they abolished follow-up questions from the audience.</p> <p>\"In 2004, they began requiring that every single question asked by the audience be submitted in advance on an index card to the moderator, who can then throw out the ones he or she does not like. And that's why the audience has essentially been reduced, in some ways, to props, because the moderator is still ultimately asking the questions.</p> <p>\"And this election cycle is the first time that the moderator herself is prohibited from asking follow-up questions, questions seeking clarification. She's essentially reduced to keeping time and being a lady with a microphone.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Making matters worse still, the Commission is run by lobbyists and funded by large corporations. As Zaid Jilani <a href=\"http://boldprogressives.org/little-known-fact-the-presidential-debate-commission-is-chaired-by-corporate-lobbyists-funded-by-corporations/\">writes today</a>, the two Commission co-chairmen are former GOP Chairman Frank J. Fahrenkopf, Jr. and former Clinton spokesman Michael D. McCurry. Fahrenkopf is one of the nation's leading <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/rev_summary.php?id=5262\">lobbyists for the gaming industry</a>, while McCurry <a href=\"http://www.psw-inc.com/mccurry.php\">advises a long list of corporate clients</a> including the telecom industry.</p> <p>The debates are paid for by <a href=\"http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=national-debate-sponsors\">large corporate sponsors</a>, including Anheuser-Busch Companies. As Jilani writes, \"in the past, the tobacco industry, AT&amp;T, and others have all been sponsors.\" And as Farah describes, with all that sponsorship comes the standard benefits:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"FARAH: 'First, the just nice advertising, of course. They get to - you know, Philip Morris sponsored one of the presidential debates, paid $250,000 and got to hang its banner in the post-debate spin room that was seen throughout the country. But more importantly, they get access, and they get to show support for both major parties.'</p> <p>\"AMY GOODMAN: 'The major parties on their podiums have Bud Light on the podium?'</p> <p>\"FARAH: 'Not yet. We're getting there. We're getting there, Amy. But they get to show support for both major parties. How often can corporations find a way to make a single donation that strengthens both the Republican and Democratic parties and get a tax deduction for that kind of donation? So it's a rare contribution. And it also gives them access. They get to go to the actual debate themselves and rub shoulders at private receptions with the campaigns and their staff.'\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, the moderators <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/79690.html\">were selected</a> to ensure that nothing unexpected is asked and that only the most staid and establishment views are heard. As journalism professor Jay Rosen put it when the names of the moderators were unveiled, using <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2009/01/16/rosen/\">terms to describe</a> those views that are acceptable in Washington media circles and those which are \"fringe\": </p> <blockquote> <p>\"In order to be considered as a candidate for moderator you have to be soaked in the sphere of consensus, likely to stay within the predictable inner rings of the sphere of legitimate controversy, and unlikely in the extreme to select any questions from the sphere of deviance.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Here then, within this one process of structuring the presidential debates, we have every active ingredient that typically defines, and degrades, US democracy. The two parties collude in secret. The have the same interests and goals. Everything is done to ensure that the political process is completely scripted and devoid of any spontaneity or reality.</p> <p>All views that reside outside the narrow confines of the two parties are rigidly excluded. Anyone who might challenge or subvert the two-party duopoly is rendered invisible. </p> <p>Lobbyists who enrich themselves by peddling their influence run everything behind the scenes. Corporations pay for the process, which they exploit and is then run to bolster rather than threaten their interests. The media's role is to keep the discourse as restrictive and unthreatening as possible while peddling the delusion that it's all vibrant and free and independent and unrestrained. And it all ends up distorting political realities far more than illuminating them while wildly exaggerating the choices available to citizens and concealing the similarities between the two parties.</p> <p>To understand the US political process, one can just look to how these sham debates are organized and how they function. This is the same process that repeats itself endlessly in virtually every other political realm.</p>",
  "<p>Tonight's town-hall debate may present the last opportunity for Barack Obama and Mitt Romney to go head-to-head over their visions on domestic policy \u2013 and there is still a whole lot of ground to cover.</p> <p>If you had a hand in picking what questions are asked, what would they be?</p> <p>Jim Lehrer moderated the first presidential match-up, which was dedicated exclusively to domestic policy. He asked six lead questions in total, covering the economy (one questions each on jobs, federal debt, and entitlements), healthcare, the role of government and, finally, a topic Lehrer described as \"governing style\".</p> <p>In the second debate, the vice-presidential candidates got to weigh in on some of the big issues of domestic policy. Moderator Martha Raddatz dedicated four of her 10 questions to domestic issues \u2013 three on the economy once more (jobs, entitlements and taxes), and one on abortion.</p> <p>That leaves us with just five topics the candidates have been forced to discuss in the debates so far: the economy, healthcare, the role of government, governing and abortion. And that last one, an always contentious issue, was framed mainly as a matter of personal and religious beliefs, not policy.</p> <p>The final debate next week is slated to <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/12/presidential-foreign-policy-debate-topics_n_1962460.html\">focus on foreign policy</a>, so tonight is <em>the</em> night to hear more on the home front.</p> <p>If you could play moderator, what six topics would you make sure were discussed?

  "<p>There are few aspects of American politics more guaranteed to provoke me into spluttering expressions of incivility than the interminable demands for more civility.</p> <p>And I've been spluttering more frequently than usual since Joe Biden's Biden-tastic debate performance last week. Never mind that <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57531059/poll-biden-takes-debate-over-ryan-uncommitted-voters-say/\">plenty of viewers</a> were persuaded by it; over recent days, the Civility Police have felt duty bound to inform us \u2013 more in sorrow than in anger, you understand \u2013 that Biden wasn't <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/ct-oped-1016-byrne-20121016,0,2134990.column\">\"respectful\"</a>. He behaved <a href=\"http://www.timesunion.com/opinion/article/Debating-reason-vs-silliness-3951238.php\">\"completely inappropriately\"</a>. Sad to say, his manner was an <a href=\"http://www.hawaiireporter.com/joe-bidens-affront-to-civility/123\">\"affront\"</a>.</p> <p>The vice-presidential malarkey provided fresh impetus to this line of argument, but it's far from new. There is an entire cottage industry of American political commentary devoted to bemoaning the alleged collapse of civility in public life, and an exceptionally boring and pompous cottage it is, too. If you're a commentator who detests the shouty duelling of cable TV \u2013 perhaps because you don't get invited to participate often enough \u2013 there's no better go-to topic. If you're a newspaper letter-writer with nothing much to say and a very strong desire to say it, you can always call for more civility. </p> <p>But this is a bad argument, and we ought (respectfully, of course!) to resist it.</p> <p>It's no coincidence, surely, that the civility argument is so frequently used by partisan commentators in order to give the impression that they're elevated far above the fray. Take this <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/michael-gerson-bidens-damaging-debate-victory/2012/10/15/c2e74c16-16ee-11e2-9855-71f2b202721b_story.html\">Washington Post column from Monday by Michael Gerson</a>, who chides Biden for \"complicat[ing] the work of democracy\", calls civility '\"the essential democratic virtue\", namechecks John Stuart Mill and the categorical imperative, then ends on a note of disappointment about the increasingly \"toxic\" nature of politics. Gerson is a former speechwriter for George Bush and a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/michael-gerson-romney-was-exceptional-when-it-counted/2012/10/04/c4bc84c2-0e45-11e2-bd1a-b868e65d57eb_story.html\">vocal</a> <a href=\"http://cjonline.com/opinion/2012-10-11/michael-gerson-romney-still-dominates\">supporter</a> of Mitt Romney. Had the vice-presidential candidates' demeanours been reversed, would he have chided Ryan for incivility? Possibly. But his column as written mounts an argument for the Republicans, while purporting to focus on the integrity of the system.</p> <p>None of which means he isn't being sincere. But as another former (Clinton) speechwriter, Eric Liu, <a href=\"http://ideas.time.com/2012/10/16/civility-in-elections-is-overrated/\">points out in a posting on Time's website</a>, this fixation on civility is based on a misunderstanding of politics:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Democracy is not just about dialogue and deliberation. It's also \u2013 in fact, primarily \u2013 about blood and guts. What we fear, what we love, what we hate, how we belong.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>It's essential to find ways to channel such passions nonviolently. It's even better if we can do so in ways that involve treating each other decently. </p> <p>But to insist, say, that debaters don't laugh at views they find preposterous, or keep quiet when they think their opponent is being dishonest, is to \"make politics seem denatured, cut off from why we even have politics.\" To refuse to pretend that you see no mathematical problems with the Romney/Ryan tax plans <em>is</em> to take those plans seriously \u2013 to treat them with the respect they deserve as policies that might actually come to pass. To let slide, in the interests of politeness, statements that you believe to be lies is to be complicit in \"complicating the work of democracy\".</p> <p>A preoccupation with civility, after all, seems to have been <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/10/jim-lehrer-manages-to-lose-the-debate.html\">what kept Jim Lehrer silent</a> during much of the first presidential debate. It's what allows pundits implicitly to equate Ryan <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2012/10/12/1002021/at-the-vice-presidential-debate-ryan-told-24-myths-in-40-minutes/\">telling 24 \"myths\"</a> during the debate with Biden maybe grinning a bit too much. It's what permits Conrad Black to <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/330385/biden-lost-conrad-black?pg=2\">declare Ryan the winner</a> because was a \"courteous young man\".</p> <p>And it's part of why tonight's debate seems likely to be so soporific: the <a href=\"http://thepage.time.com/2012/10/15/the-2012-debates-memorandum-of-understanding-between-the-obama-and-romney-campaigns/\">preconditions agreed by the candidates</a>, along with the <a href=\"http://thepage.time.com/2012/10/14/moderator-role-under-scrutiny-before-the-debate/\">pressure being exerted on moderator Candy Crowley</a>, all seem designed to squelch any spirited discussion.</p> <p>\"Civility\" may once have been shorthand for the qualities that keep a rambunctious democracy from spilling over into armed confrontation. But too often, these days, it's shorthand for a pseudo-neutral politeness that places decorum above truth-telling.</p> <p>With all due respect, could we have a bit less of it?</p>",
  "<p>The supreme court has denied a request by Ohio state officials to close down early voting in the three days before the election.</p> <p>The conflict began when Ohio's Republican-controlled legislature passed a law making voting on the weekend before the election illegal for most voters.

  "<p>Over the weekend, we learned that the Romney and Obama campaigns were extremely concerned that Candy Crowley of CNN, the moderator for Tuesday's debate, might try to commit journalism. Neither side wanted <em>that</em>. </p> <p>But there's not much they can do about it. Because they're not in charge. Of course, neither is she. In fact, no one is really in charge of the presidential debates. The situation is in charge. That's about all you can say.</p> <p>Let me explain.</p> <p>Mark Halperin of Time magazine <a href=\"http://thepage.time.com/2012/10/14/moderator-role-under-scrutiny-before-the-debate/\">broke the story</a> on Sunday. Politico <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/burns-haberman/2012/10/report-obama-romney-camps-send-letter-to-debates-commission-138421.html#.UHuPBRa7u1Q.twitter\">confirmed</a> it with their sources. Both campaigns had complained to the Commission on Public Debates, the organizer of Tuesday's townhall-style event, after Crowley<a href=\"http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/191561/candidates-debates-commission-upset-candy-crowley-may-ask-follow-up-questions-tuesday/\"> made it clear</a> in interviews that she would be engaging in certain normal journalistic behaviors. These included: pressing for answers, following up if needed and moving the candidates off their stump speeches and talking points.</p> <p>The lawyers for Romney and the lawyers for Obama thought they had an agreement: the moderators would not be doing any of that. And in a sense they were right. They <em>did</em> have an agreement. Crowley <em>was</em> ignoring parts of it. Halperin had been leaked a copy of the document that is negotiated between the two campaigns, specifying the rules for the four presidential debates. For example: The candidates can't bring notes with them, but they can take notes. (Good rule.) No shout-outs to anyone in the audience, except your family. (Good rule.) Then there's this one:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In managing the two-minute comment periods, the moderator will not rephrase the question or open a new topic\u2026 The moderator <strong>will not ask follow-up questions or comment</strong> on either the questions asked by the audience or the answers of the candidates during the debate<strong> or otherwise intervene in the debate</strong> except to acknowledge the questioners from the audience or enforce the time limits, and invite candidate comments during the two-minute response period.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>(My bold.) In other words: <em>Just hold the mic and keep the clock, Candy</em>. Good rule?</p> <p>On that we have no consensus. But the strange thing is that our complete lack of consensus has been built into the system. That's why we keep arguing about it. It can sound arcane, like a dispute over procedure, with big egos getting in the way. But what we're really arguing about is this: In a real debate, in a grown-up world, in the political and media systems we actually have, does presidential power need an interlocutor to reveal itself? Or can it speak <em>for</em> itself and by taking responsibility \u2013 stepping up to the plate, under pressure \u2013 make itself sufficiently clear?</p> <p>In the first debate, Jim Lehrer of PBS tried <a href=\"http://pressthink.org/2012/10/the-vanishing-moderator-jim-lehrer-answers-your-questions-about-his-part-in-the-first-debate/\">the Vanishing Moderator method</a>. That's my term for it. He tossed out some big topic areas and got out of the way. (Not <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2012/10/04/jim_lehrer_vs_silentjimlehrer_a_closer_look_at_the_pbs_newshour_anchor_s_debate_performance_.html\">completely</a>, though.) Explaining himself afterwards, he said that the he and the commission wanted to push the form, try something new. \"Get out of the way\" means let the candidates confront each other. You are <em>not</em> their interlocutor. They do that for each other. You start things rolling, keep time, and invite them into the issues. You try to be dull (Jim Lehrer: \"What are the major differences between the two of you about how you would go about creating new jobs?\") so that they can shine. It's up to them to reveal themselves, and to \"check\" each other. If they choose not to, viewers will judge them for their passivity under pressure.</p> <p>Lehrer declared himself, proudly, a debate-moderator minimalist.</p> <p>In the vice-presidential debate, Martha Raddatz said something like this back: Thank you for your service, Jim Lehrer! I will <a href=\"http://www.mercurynews.com/scott-herhold/ci_21757780/forceful-raddatz-draws-praise-moderator\">not be taking your approach</a>. I am the interlocutor tonight. I represent the audience's interest in getting better answers. And <a href=\"http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/11/in-praise-of-martha-raddatz/?pagewanted=all\">I will intervene</a> when needed. Politely, of course! And if I don't hear any specifics, I will press the candidates to provide them. I am also a reporter myself, and will bring my knowledge to the table when I ask my questions. I think the people watching this understand very well why I am here, so abuse me at your peril. Are you ready, candidates?</p> <p>To Jim Lehrer's minimalism and Martha Raddatz's vitalism, Candy Crowley has to bring something different: a kind of ventriloquism. The debate she will moderate Tuesday night is described in the agreement between the campaigns as the \"audience participation ('Town Hall') format\". The questions originate not with the moderator but with a <a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/topics/elections/attitude-check/debate-drawing-town-hall-audience\">specially selected</a> group of very, very undecided voters \u2013 as picked by Gallup. Crowley meets with them beforehand, finds out what they want to ask, and chooses the few she is going to call on, indirectly selecting the questions but also picking the characters who will step to the microphone and speak. Her participation takes place through their (closely managed) participation. She amplifies their intent.</p> <p>Her authority is also mixed up with theirs. Each person called on is a potential stand-in for the frustrated American voter. Televisually, Crowley equalizes the inherent power difference between standing candidates for president and the undecided voters rising to ask their questions. She can sharpen a question or follow up when it isn't answered, advocating for the questioner's right to hear straight talk from the candidates. It doesn't matter what the agreement signed by the candidates' lawyers says. Crowley isn't a party to it, she didn't sign, and anyway the parties aren't in charge.</p> <p>The debates in their current form are a temporary alliance among three players: the campaigns of the major-party candidates for president, the Commission on Presidential Debates and the journalists who are chosen to moderate and maintain order. Each draws power from a different source. The campaigns are the exclusive agents for the two main characters in the drama; without them there is nothing. The commission represents in institutional form the expectation Americans voters now have that the nominees for president will meet face to face and argue their respective cases. This is a potent force. It's virtually impossible for the candidates to refuse, although nothing in election law prevents it. The journalists who moderate have power because once the cameras come on and the debate begins, no one is telling them what to say.</p> <p>Each player is also weak, in its way. The campaigns are weak because of the inherent risk in submitting to questions on live television before an audience of 50 to 60 million. No matter how hard the candidates prepare, there is no way to prevent something unexpected from happening. And the risk of catastrophic failure is real, as Texas governor Rick Perry learned during the primary season. Yet they have to participate.</p> <p>The commission's weakness is structural: it has no constitutional or statutory right to put on the debates and no base of power independent of the two major parties, which created it in 1987. The moderators are weak because no one elected them, everyone can criticize them, and they're supposed to be completely upstaged by the candidates. \"It's not about the moderator!\" is something on which everyone agrees. This constrains their every move. But not completely.</p> <p>The result is that no one is fully in charge of Tuesday night's debate. But this is too scary for such high stakes. So rules are invented, like the ones that were leaked to Mark Halperin. In reality, the rules don't describe what happens because the real limits are audience expectations, which bear down on everyone in the hall with greater force than any timekeeper. Do we expect power to reveal itself without an interlocutor? If more and more of us do, pressure will build for the Vanishing Moderator. But we aren't there yet. Lack of consensus reigns.</p> <p>After he drew criticism for light questioning, Jim Lehrer wanted to explain better his approach. \"I was not there to question people,\" he said. \"I was there to allow the candidates to question each other.\" But the <a href=\" http://thepage.time.com/2012/10/15/the-2012-debates-memorandum-of-understanding-between-the-obama-and-romney-campaigns/\">agreement signed by the two campaigns</a> says, flat out: \"The candidates may not ask each other direct questions during any of the four debates.\"</p> <p>He did it anyway, because he could. The rules aren't going to help us, people. The Great Commission is powerless to decide. Despite all precautions the moderator and the candidates are always alive in unknown territory when the debate broadcast starts. This freaks everyone out, but I say let freedom ring.</p>",
  "<p>Leading Republicans have accused Barack Obama of trying to duck responsibility for the attack in Benghazi after the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, accepted the blame for security failures over the killing of the American ambassador to Libya and three other officials by an armed militia.</p> <p>In an apparent attempt to weaken a potential line of attack on Obama by Mitt Romney in Tuesday's crucial debate, Clinton broke away from a tour of Latin America to tell US television networks that responsibility for the circumstances that led to the death of the ambassador, Chris Stevens, stops with her not the White House.</p> <p>\"I take responsibility,\" Clinton told CNN. \"I'm in charge of the state department's 60,000-plus people all over the world and 275 posts. The president and the vice-president wouldn't be knowledgeable about specific decisions that are made by security professionals. They're the ones who weigh all of the threats and the risks and the needs and make a considered decision.\"</p> <p>Republicans reacted with scorn and accused the White House of attempting to shirk responsibility for failures exposed by a hearing in Congress last week, i<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/10/benghazi-attack-testimony-state-departmen\">ncluding the state department's</a> refusal of requests to strengthen diplomatic security in Libya even following a series of attacks on American, British and other international targets in Benghazi.</p> <p>Richard Williamson, a Romney foreign policy adviser, said he expected the Romney to use the debate to press the president to \"man up and accept responsibility\" for failures that led to Stevens' death.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressOffice.PressReleases&amp;ContentRecord_id=6759be04-0aad-51c7-c3fe-46c799fcd3e9\">Senator John McCain praised Clinton</a> for \"throwing herself under the bus\" to shield Obama. But McCain joined two other Republican senators \u2013 Lindsey Graham and Kelly Ayotte \u2013 in questioning White House claims that it knew nothing of the deteriorating security situation in Benghazi ahead of the killings on September 11 nor the requests for added protection.</p> <p>They noted that the attack on the US consulate was \"preceded by an escalating pattern of attacks this year in Benghazi\".</p> <p>\"If the president was truly not aware of this rising threat level in Benghazi, then we have lost confidence in his national security team, whose responsibility it is to keep the president informed,\" the senators said. \"But if the president was aware of these earlier attacks in Benghazi prior to the events of September 11, 2012, then he bears full responsibility for any security failures that occurred.</p> <p>\"The security of Americans serving our nation everywhere in the world is ultimately the job of the commander-in-chief. The buck stops there.\"</p> <p>While Clinton moved to shield the president, she also accepted responsibility only up to a point. The secretary of state said specific decisions about protection in Benghazi were made by others.</p> <p>\"The decisions about security assets are made by security professionals,\" she told Fox News.</p> <p>Clinton also sought to shift some of the responsibility for inaccurate statements initially made by administration officials about the circumstances of the assault on the Benghazi consulate.</p> <p>Five days after the attack, the administration sent the US ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice, on to television talk shows to say that the assault was part of a broader backlash across the Middle East against an anti-Muslim video. The administration later backtracked, describing the attack as a preplanned terrorist assault that went on for several hours.</p> <p>Clinton said Rice was merely conveying faulty intelligence.</p> <p>\"As the intelligence community has now said, their assessment over the last month changed. But everyone in the administration was trying to give information to the best of their ability at the time with the caveat that more was likely to be learned and there would be most likely changes,\" she told Fox News. \"The fog of war, the confusion you get in any kind of combat situation, remember this was an attack that went on for hours.\"</p> <p>Rice also denied the administration was covering up the true nature of the attack.</p> <p>\"It was purely a function of what was provided to us,\" she told the Washington Post.</p> <p>But McCain remained sceptical.</p> <p>\"They're either deceiving the American people or they are so incompetent they don't deserve to serve,\" he said.</p> <p>Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Centre for Politics, said Clinton's series of interviews were clearly an effort to draw fire away from the White House.</p> <p>\"There's three weeks to the election and Obama's struggling. The last thing he needs is to have this placed on this plate so she's doing her party duty. She swinging into action as Bill [Clinton] swung into action for the party convention,\" he said.</p> <p>But Sabato said that while Obama will be relieved to be able to defend himself in the debate by pointing to Clinton's statements, there is little evidence that Republican criticism is having an impact on the election.</p> <p>\"This issue is not cutting. It's not having an impact. People seem to be focused squarely on domestic and economic matters in this election, and I just haven't seen any impact,\" Sabato said. \"The Republican base is interested but they've already made a decision.\"</p> <p>The greater impact may ultimately be on Clinton if she decides to make a bid for the presidency in 2016.</p> <p>\"It would come back and it would be used by her opponents. I can't imagine it would by any means be the decisive issue. But if she does run, the critical question among the Obama supporters will be: was she loyal? So far the Clintons are the best thing Obama has got going,\" Sabato said.</p>",
  "<p>Fifty years after the Cuban missile crisis, three generations of American policy-makers have cut teeth on those events that brought the United States and the Soviet Union to the brink in October 1962. This generation is now winding its way upwards as twenty- and thirtysomething speechwriters, special assistants, reporters and congressional candidates. </p> <p>The basic outline of what they have been taught remains the one <a href=\"http://live.belfercenter.org/publication/1334/second_look.html\">canonized by Harvard's Graham Allison</a> some 25 years ago, in four lessons. First, \"nuclear war is really possible.\" Second, \"the principal risk of nuclear war arises from the uncontrollable\" events that take place during genuine crises \u2013 such as simple mistakes or errors of perception \u2013 and not from the risk that rational human beings will intend war as a matter of policy. Third, \"the reality of nuclear interdependence\" means that states depend upon other states to avoid war for their own survival. Taken together, these \"perils of crisis management\" in the nuclear age ultimately teach that \"crisis must be prevented.\"</p> <p>In other words, if it is true that the only way to win a nuclear war is not to play, the only way to guarantee we don't find ourselves in an accidental pick-up game is to prevent crises before they occur. </p> <p>These lessons still hold; but they are far less obvious than they were in 1987, when the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact still existed, Osama bin Laden was fighting alongside US allies, email was for universities and Twitter was for the birds.</p> <p>Is nuclear war really possible? <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/04/12/cnn-poll-public-divided-on-eliminating-all-nuclear-weapons/\">Americans today still worry</a> about the possibility of a nuclear attack, though by a stateless terrorist group, rather than from Russia or China. But we are less likely to believe a nuclear war \u2013 as opposed to a one-off terrorist attack \u2013 is possible. So, even as military planners increasingly find nuclear weapons less useful than decades ago, the public responds to the possibility of nuclear terrorism with the desire for the US to keep its weapons, which are <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2012/08/06/top_air_force_officer_backup_supply_of_nuclear_warheads_larger_than_needed/\">more numerous now</a> than in the 1980s.</p> <p>What is uncontrollable? During the cold war, or by the 1980s at any rate, conventional wisdom held that our Soviet opponents were rational, interested in regime survival, and thus deterrable. Therefore, the threat of accident and misperception was as great as that posed by Communist aggression. Today, arguing that Iran's leaders are rational, and deterrable, is enough to get you called out from a presidential campaign podium \u2013 even if you are <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/security/2012/03/01/435346/dempsey-iran-rational-actor/?mobile=nc\">chairman of the joint chiefs</a>.</p> <p>The irrationality of North Korea's leadership is an article of faith on the right, though <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/kim/them/hermit.html\">not among experts</a> who have actually spent time there. (It seems necessary to note that \"rational\" is not the same thing as \"moral\".) If the threat from \"the uncontrollable\" now is perceived to arise from the character of regimes and terrorist groups, rather than circumstance, then lessons three and four of Allison have been placed in doubt. And so, we have the Pentagon worried about misperception and accident, showing interest in hotlines and incidents-at-sea agreements with Cuba and Iran \u2013 and political leaders saying no.</p> <p>What about nuclear interdependence? Developments in the last two decades or so have brought this core tenet of deterrence theory very much into question for those countries that must plan to deter the United States \u2013 and thus, for us as well.</p> <p>First, Ronald Reagan's dream of national missile defense remains so attractive precisely because it seems to offer a path out of interdependence (which, back in the day, we used to call \"mutual assured destruction\"). Experts, however, continue to tell us that watertight coverage is <a href=\"http://armscontrolnow.org/2012/10/03/for-missile-defense-it-depends-is-not-good-enough/\">unlikely to impossible</a>, and systems to counter such defenses will always be cheaper and advance faster than the systems themselves \u2013 both thanks to the laws of physics.</p> <p>Second, we are moving rapidly toward hyper-powerful, hyper-effective non-nuclear weapons with destructive powers that, decades ago, would have required nuclear weapons. If the United States is one day able to make a credible, non-nuclear threat to cripple another state's nuclear forces \u2013 which future systems like <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/world/europe/23strike.html\">Prompt Global Strike</a> are moving steadily toward \u2013 then does that end our nuclear interdependence? Could cyber weapons one day achieve similar effects? Some US commentators and political leaders believe this would be a good thing.</p> <p>But a moment's thought about how the leaders of a smaller nuclear power could be expected to respond to such a threat should be disquieting. Hard as it may be to imagine for those old enough to have grown up with nuclear nightmares and duck-and-cover drills, we might come to miss that interdependence once it is gone.</p> <p>Lastly, do we still believe in crisis prevention? The debate continues, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/15/cuban-missile-crisis-russian-roulette\">including here</a>, about who got the better of whom 50 years ago. But we know that both Kennedy and Khrushchev believed it was important to de-escalate, important to control the hotheads in each of their governments, and important enough to risk their own leadership to do so. Each spent a great deal of time, before and after, publicly criticizing the other. But each could withdraw to private diplomacy and crisis management when he needed to.</p> <p>Is this still true? Fifty years ago, the discussion and debate over how to manage the crisis was influenced by an extremely small number of voices. The sources of information the American public \u2013 and decision-makers \u2013 had were limited. And neither the media nor the public had the ability to know and comment on everything as it happened. For better and worse, it is now simply impossible to control the media and public environment as Kennedy, to say nothing of Khrushchev, did. This year alone has seen <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/09/12/social-media-and-the-assassination-of-an-ambassador.html\">Twitter turn</a> a series of demonstrations and a terrorist attack in North Africa into a central issue of the presidential campaign, outstrip policy-makers in managing the sensitive case of a would-be Chinese defector and <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/twitter-room/other-news/250129-obama-camp-hammers-romney-on-47-percent-through-social-media\">magnify</a> gaffe, after gaffe, after gaffe. </p> <p>Fifty years after Cuba, in short, nuclear war is still possible. Crisis management is more perilous and the international environment is, if anything, less controllable. America is now as interdependent in economics, health and well-being as we were in nuclear strategy then. We have not learned to live with our interdependence any more gracefully.</p>",

  "<p>Barack Obama is preparing to fly to New York from his Virginia retreat for the second presidential debate against Mitt Romney, in which the president has to put in a strong performance if he is going to halt Romney's poll momentum.</p> <p>Obama's mission has been given added urgency by a new poll showing his lead cut to just four points in Pennsylvania, traditionally a Democratic-leaning state.</p> <p>Obama's task is a difficult one, given that the debate format is town-hall style in which questions come from the audience, meaning the president and Romney have to devote at least some of the 90 minutes to answering questions civilly, rather than in direct confrontation.</p> <p>It is harder, too, for Obama to make the same impact as Romney did in Denver on October 3 as second debates usually attract fewer viewers than the first.</p> <p>Obama, according to aides, was spending his final hours before flying to New York working out, and undertaking a last round of debate preparation.</p> <p>Obama's team said that in the debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, Long Island, he will challenge Romney on his remark about 47% of voters being freeloaders, and also on healthcare and his tax and deficit-reduction plans.</p> <p>The Democrats dismissed the minor controversy over how involved the moderator, CNN's Candy Crowley, should be. Obama's adviser David Axelrod tweeted: \"Enough already about moderators. POTUS is ready for a vigorous debate and Q's from all comers!\"</p> <p>The Romney camp, based outside Boston, is bracing itself for the media writing, at the hint of an improvement by Obama, a 'comeback' story.</p> <p>Romney's campaign team, whose news management is improving, followed the announcement of $170m in fundraising in September with an announcement on Tuesday morning that their candidate is being backed by Ross Perot, who ran for the presidency as an independent in 1992 and 1996. Romney described him as \"a living legend\".</p> <p>Perot, in a statement endorsing Romney, said: \"The fact of the matter is that the United States is on unsustainable course. At stake is nothing less than our position in the world, our standard of living at home, and our constitutional freedoms.\"</p> <p>But the big surprise is the Quinnipiac poll which put Obama on 50% to Romney's 46% in Pennsylvania, where neither side has spent much time campaigning, evidence it is not regarded as competitive by either team. </p> <p>The Quinnipiac poll would need to be supported by a stream of similar poll findings before the Romney campaign would even consider diverting the vast sums that would be needed to fight the state.</p> <p>The importance of Quinnipiac on Pennsylvania is dramatic evidence of the drift in the polls in Romney's favour since Obama's poor showing in the Denver debate. Quinnipiac shows a huge jump for Romney in Pennsylvania since last month, when Obama was on 54% to Romney's 42%.</p>",
  "<p>The first visit to the food bank is always the hardest. Michelle Venus, 52, cried. \"Not while I was there,\" she said. \"But before and after.\" Four years earlier, she'd been a homeowner in a $75,000 a year job. She'd donated to the food bank's fundraising drives. Now she was there to pick up food she couldn't afford to buy. \"It was not what I'd expected for myself or from myself. It was just a really hard day.\"</p> <p>Mark Weaver, 54, the former chairman of nearby Loveland chamber of commerce, tried to avoid the gaze of acquaintances he'd met when he attended the food bank's galas. \"It was very humiliating,\" he says. \"I used to take clients to their events, and all of a sudden I'm living below the poverty line.\" He used to earn a six-figure salary plus commission plus benefits, and also chaired the Northern Colorado Legislative Alliance, which lobbied local politicians on behalf of the business community. He made up his mind to go after a friend, a well-paid software engineer who'd also fallen on hard times, told him to: \"Get over being proud.\"</p> <p>The queue at the Larimer County food bank in Fort Collins, a town of 147,000 in northern Colorado, snakes out of the door and is mostly silent. In line there are slightly more people than trolleys. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/dec/09/land-of-free-home-of-hungry\">The number of families visiting here</a> has increased more than 50% over the last five years. On average they also visit more often and need more food. </p> <p>In the parking lot there are only two bumper stickers \u2013 one for Mitt Romney and one for the US navy. Inside it is set up like a grocery store. People take what they need, although there are limits for some items such as bread. From the outside, if you didn't know it was a food bank, you might think they were going to the cinema.</p> <p>People often think they know what poverty looks like until they end up here, and then they realise it looks like them and many other people that they know. Weaver lives in a nice area. The first he knew that his next-door neighbour was struggling with his mortgage payments was when his house was foreclosed on and he was moving out.</p> <p>The official poverty rate in the US has risen 19% since 2000 with just under <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/150122/americans-access-basic-necessities-recession-level.aspx\">one in seven Americans now poor</a> and one in five reporting they did not have enough money to buy food last year.</p> <p>But since the beginning of the financial crisis it is the 'precarity rate' that has really taken off \u2013 the number of people who feel economically precarious. Those who fear poverty, look it straight in the eye at the end of every month, face a constant battle to avoid it or slip in and out of it while struggling to retain every semblance of middle-class stability. People who may have high school diplomas, college degrees, pensions, good credit and mortgages, juggling aspiration and reality, who find themselves one lay-off or illness away from a steep and dizzying descent into hardship.</p> <p>More than the half the people who use the Larimer County Food Bank are working. One in 10 have at least a college degree, almost a third have no health insurance and more than half have unpaid medical bills.</p> <p>\"There's been a real difference, not only in the number of people that we serve in recent years,\" explains Amy Pezzani, the food bank's executive director. \"But also in the kind of people we serve. People think that if they're not living in poverty then they're middle class. But the official poverty level is such an unrealistic indicator of economic status. Most of the people who use the food bank are working people. These used to be referred to as 'emergency food pantries', but now it's like people are having an emergency every day. It's really just a way to exist.\"</p> <h2>'There are more people struggling that the official numbers show'</h2> <p>Last year the census bureau <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/08/us/poverty-gets-new-measure-at-census-bureau.html\">released a new measurement of poverty</a>, which takes regional cost of living, medical payments and other expenses into account and found <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/19/us/census-measures-those-not-quite-in-poverty-but-struggling.html\">a third of Americans are either in poverty or desperately close to it</a>. Half are married, almost half are suburban. \"These numbers are higher than we anticipated,\" Trudi Renwick, the bureau's head poverty statistician, told the New York Times. \"There are more people struggling than the official numbers show.\"</p> <p>This is the fragile economic terrain on which the election is being fought: the needs and aspirations of the ever-expanding numbers of America's working poor and the far larger ranks of those anxious about joining them.</p> <p>These are the people most likely to be offended by Mitt Romney's suggestion that 47% of the country see themselves as victims, who most needed the kind of change Obama promised four years ago, and have been least impressed by the apparent lack of it. These are the people at whom the ads attacking Romney's record of outsourcing and asset-stripping at Bain Capital were aimed.</p> <p>They are also the ones the Tea Party sought to galvanise through their populist message against the bailout and in defence of small business. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/15/us/politics/15poll.html\">A New York Times poll in 2010</a> revealed that more than half of those who identified as Tea Party supporters were concerned that someone in their household would be out of a job in the next year, while more than two-thirds said the recession had been difficult or caused hardship and major life changes.</p> <p>A slim majority of Americans <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/winning-has-become-not-losing-20120927\">now define getting ahead as \"not falling behind\"</a>. That describes life for many here in <a href=\"http://larimer.org/compass/exec_summary.htm\">Larimer County</a>, where between 2006 and 2010 <a href=\"http://larimer.org/compass/median_family_income_ec_ind.htm#chart3 \">median family income</a> (adjusted for inflation) shrank by 9% leaving around a third of homeowners <a href=\"http://larimer.org/compass/homeownership_cd_housing.htm#chart4\">paying 30% or more of their income for housing</a>.</p> <p>The number of people using food stamps, and applying for heating assistance over the last six years has rocketed. Over the past 10 years the number of children getting free and reduced lunch doubled, while <a href=\"http://larimer.org/compass/higher_education_enrollment_ed.htm#chart4\">in-state tuition fees at Colorado State University</a>, which has a huge campus in town, increased 138%.</p> <p>The Fort Collins Homelessness Prevention Initiative, which provides one-time grants for emergency rent assistance, has seen a 50% increase in the number of people they are helping every year. \"We mainly serve two kinds of people,\" explains executive director Sue Beck-Ferkiss. \"One are the pay-check surfers who are used to skating by on very little. But we also see more people who are falling out of the middle class. It could be a couple who both worked on contract. The work dries up. But the world doesn't stop just because your income stops. They wipe out their savings and maybe they end up here.\"</p> <h2>'I don't think the Republican party cares about people like me'</h2> <p>Larimer County is a swing county in a swing state. It voted for Bush twice, but went for Obama in 2008. Now Colorado is on the fence and Mark Weaver is right there with it.</p> <p>Mark is one of those rare species this election. An undecided voter with genuinely eclectic views. He's an evangelical Christian who is for gun control and a more humane immigration policy, who wants to rein in the deficit, thinks unions are dinosaurs and is against abortion although he'd rather peoples' hearts changed than legislation. He voted for John McCain last time because he didn't think Obama had the experience, and was a registered Republican until July 4 when, appropriately enough, he registered as an independent.</p> <p>Both campaigns are spending millions to reach him with microtargetting on the issues they think will swing his vote their way. They're also bombarding him with ads. But all they are earning so far is his contempt. \"If you took all the money they spent on the political system and elections you could feed the world,\" Weaver says.</p> <p>He's not particularly impressed by either candidate. \"Somebody's got to fix the economy, but I don't know that either of them has the guts to do it,\" he says. \"I'm looking to vote for someone I like and trust; I've never been more distrustful of the whole thing. I wish we could vote for none of the above. I want a do-over.\"</p> <p>Mark's fortunes began to change in the summer of 2009 when was a human resources manager in a company with 1,500 employees. He was let go and replaced by a colleague 20 years his junior on half his salary. He could have found other work elsewhere in the country, but that would have involved uprooting his three children, and he didn't think that was fair. He got another job in a start-up that involved a long commute and eventually collapsed owing him money. With his mortgage paid off and no debts, the biggest expense for a family of five was healthcare. Since everyone in the family was healthy they contemplated doing without it.</p> <p>Then his youngest daughter got bitten by a rattlesnake. \"That would have been a six-figure healthcare bill,\" he says. \"If we'd gotten rid of healthcare at that point we would have been sunk.\" It was around that time he started going to the food bank. He stopped after he got a job at a major bookstore as a night-time accountant and head cashier paying just $9 an hour but with good health benefits, and is now getting a human resources consultancy practice off the ground.</p> <p>When Pezzani heard the tape of Romney referring disparagingly to the 47% of the country who don't pay taxes she was unimpressed. \"It's very difficult to see the folks that we're serving maligned in that way,\" she says. Beck-Ferkiss at the HPI has similar reservations. \"It's hard for me to believe that Romney is focused on the population that I serve,\" she says.</p> <p>Mark, however, says <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/18/mitt-romney-turning-into-john-kerry-2012-election\">it just confirmed everything he already thought</a>. \"It doesn't surprise me about Romney because he's always struck me as a stuffed shirt. He's arrogant, and it's hard for me to get past that. It didn't change my mind about him because I always thought that about him. It was exactly the same as Obama saying \"You didn't build that\". Those were exactly the words I would expect to come out of his mouth.\"</p> <p>Michelle, on the other hand, was devastated. \"I was heartbroken,\" she says. \"I was highly offended. I thought he's just disrespected me personally. I just don't think the Republican party cares about people like me.\" Michelle describes herself as a lifelong Democrat. She had not long moved to the Fort Collins area when her husband was diagnosed with brain cancer. They had health insurance, but with only one salary coming in they ate through their savings just to keep afloat. \"We raided our personal accounts to survive.\"</p> <p>She got a job in marketing paying $75,000 a year and remained relatively comfortable in the 2,400 sq ft house she was buying. Then she lost that job and went into consulting. \"I just kept going,\" she says. \"I lived through recessions before, and assumed I'd come out the other side.\" But work was drying up and when her boyfriend of six years killed himself last March she struggled to keep up. \"After that I'd get up to feed my dogs but that was about it.\" When a client complained that she wasn't meeting deadlines she texted back: \"I'm just not trying to kill myself.\"</p> <p>Struggling to pay the mortgage on the house, which had been sold on from her bank to a loan company, she tried to renegotiate. In a conference call with an adviser and the lender, she was told that it made more sense to foreclose on her than change the terms of the loan. \"I stopped paying the mortgage and got the house ready to sell,\" she says. She managed to sell it for a small profit and move into a place less than half the size with her son. It was around this time she found herself crying as she prepared to go to the food bank. \"I just couldn't make ends meet,\" she says. \"I don't go every week. Just when I really need something. When I first went I was worried that I would see people I knew. \"</p> <p>Now she's starting a new career as a journalist and has scaled down considerably and muddles through. \"I have an understanding mechanic,\" she says. \"If something happens to my car and I can't pay him everything he let's me pay what I can.\"</p> <p>She thinks things are getting better, although she wishes they would improve faster. She blames the slow pace on the Republican congress rather than Obama. \"He tried to incorporate some of what they want but ever since he got in all they've wanted to do is get him out.\"</p> <p>The ramifications of the inability of the nation's political culture to engage with this <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/15/democrats-romney-firing-obama\">increasingly pervasive sense of fragility</a> goes beyond the immediate election. Since the financial crisis began five years ago, the significant shift in Americans' economic wellbeing has posed a considerable challenge to both national mythology and the political rhetoric on which it is built.</p> <p>Among other things, the American dream rests on the notion of meritocracy and progress \u2013 that those who work hard will get on, that each year will better than the last and each generation better off than their parents'. Since 1977, when Gallup first asked if people thought they would be personally better off the following year, an overwhelming majority say yes every year, even though there have been four recessions. It's not a guarantee of success \u2013 indeed, quite the opposite. Inequality of wealth, and the poverty that comes with it, is tolerable on the understanding that there will be equality of opportunity. While only 2% described themselves as \"rich\", 31% thought it very likely or somewhat likely they would \"ever be rich\".</p> <p>\"Because differences in income in the US are believed to be related to skill and effort, and because social mobility is assumed to be high,\" <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/events/2012/09/20-middle-class-pathways#ref-id=20120920_ES_Sawhill\">argued Isabel Sawhill</a>, co-director of the Centre on Children and Families at the Brookings Institution in September, \"inequality seems to be more acceptable than in Europe\".</p> <p>But the recent downturn has delivered a severe dent to that self-image. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/12/business/economy/family-net-worth-drops-to-level-of-early-90s-fed-says.html?_r=1\">A report earlier this year</a> showed that between 2007 and 2010 the median American family lost a generation of wealth. <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/147350/Optimism-Future-Youth-Reaches-Time-Low.aspx\">Most Americans believe it unlikely</a> that young people will have a better life than their parents \u2013 the highest on record.</p> <h2>'I still feel the American dream is available to me'</h2> <p>Meanwhile, as the National Journal's Ron Brownstein made clear recently, the sclerotic effects of class entrenchment are <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/next-economy/is-american-faith-in-upward-mobility-faltering--20120926\">becoming ever more deeply embedded</a>. In a study called 'Pathways to the middle class', Sawhill and two colleagues pointed out that nearly two-thirds of children born to parents in the bottom fifth of income stay in that category as adults, while more than three-fifths of children born into families in the top fifth remain in theirs.</p> <p>But despite that it seems the belief in the American dream remains steadfast. Eighty-five percent of Americans still believe theirs is the land of opportunity, <a href=\"http://www.allstate.com/heartland-monitor/getting-ahead-h14.aspx\">while other polls over the last four years</a> reveal a sizeable majority of Americans still believe \"the American dream is still possible and achievable for \u2026 people like you\".</p> <p>When Mark reflects on the last few years he falls back on his faith. \"This experience has definitely made me more humble. I think God's made me more authentically who I am.\"</p> <p>Having moved into a smaller home with her teenage son, Michelle now wonders why she surrounded herself with so many things she didn't need. </p> <p>\"When I was working, if I saw something I wanted I would buy it. Now I wonder if I really need it. When I see people in Target getting all these things for Halloween I think: what are you going to do with all that stuff? Where are you going to put it? I still feel the American dream is available to me. I'm not prepared to let that go yet,\" she says. \"But I no longer think it's about being a consumer.\"</p>",

First, he needs to hammer Romney in the areas he is vulnerable, such as the secret video in which he dismissed 47% of the population as freeloaders, and Romney's plans on taxation and reducing the deficit, which Romney repeatedly dodges when asked for specifics. Second, he needs to defend his first term, being unapologetic about reforms such as healthcare. Lastly, he needs to offer some indication of what he would use a second four years in office to achieve, beyond seeing his healthcare reform programme introduced.</p> <p><strong>Romney:</strong> He needs a repeat of his Denver performance: aggressive, confident and looking presidential. He needs to add to the more human, personal touches. Above all else though, he needs a message, a reason for people to vote for him other than the fact that he is not Barack Obama. The closest he has come to a message is that, as a former businessman, he understands the economy and job creation better than Obama. His team keep promising he will provide 'specifics' of what he would do as president but he has yet to do so, and time is running out.</p> <h2>Ana Marie Cox</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397827785\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/9/28/1317225418768/Annmarie_Cox.jpg\" alt=\"Ana Marie Cox\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Obama:</strong> Needs to drink a Red Bull, preferably without mentioning that it was, in fact, a Red Bull on camera. Though if he sky-dove onto the stage, I think that could score some points. More seriously: hammer home just how much the middle class, poor, students, and women will suffer under a Romney administration.</p> <p><strong>Romney:</strong> Needs to continue lie smoothly and frequently, remember to upload his latest HumanEmotionSimulacra\u2122 software. More seriously: Libya, Libya, Libya \u2013 it's the administration's most serious screw-up of the cycle, at least its most obvious and public one. Not that Romney has the foreign policy chops to really take the president to the mat on this, but it's a real issue and real weakness. Most likely he'll just talk about the deficit.</p> <h2>Gary Younge</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397827786\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/artsblog/authorpics/gary_younge.jpg\" alt=\"Gary Younge\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Obama:</strong> He must not try to compensate for his previous performance by showing extra aggression. What's done is done, that's not who he is and authenticity beats aggression. Finally, in a town hall format, it'll go down badly. He needs to be engaged not enraged. He should focus on people's questions and skewer Romney sparingly and thoroughly. Debates are a performance and tonight his goal should be to bring out the contrast between their personalities and contradictions in Romney's policies. He must be himself \u2013 only more so.</p> <p><strong>Romney:</strong> Needs to recreate that animated version of himself that appeared in Denver while somehow parrying the inevitable charge that he talks out of both sides of his mouth. He also needs to use the town hall set up to emphasise whatever empathetic, human qualities he has. People still don't like him that much and have trouble to relating to him. As such tonight holds the risk of reminding viewers won over by his performance in Denver why it took so long to come around</p> <h2>Richard Adams</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397827787\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/artsblog/authorpics/richard_adams.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Adams\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Obama:</strong> The best advice for Barack Obama is what not to do. Specifically: don't be Al Gore of 2000, who overcompensated for his lackluster performance by upping the tempo in the subsequent debates. The nadir came in the third debate, when Gore lurched over to stand uncomfortably close to his rival. Bush looked at Gore like he was a weirdo and got a laugh from the audience. Whereupon Gore uttered the immortal phrase: \"But what about the Dingle-Norwood bill?\" If you're going to get heavy on your opponent, at least make it for something meaningful.</p> <p><strong>Romney:</strong>While it's tempting to offer advice to Mitt Romney that includes \"Why not bring along a good book to read during quiet moments in the debate?\" the reality is that the immediate pressure is off him on Tuesday night. If the punches being telegraphed by the Obama campaign are accurate \u2013 that Obama will raise the 47% line and so on \u2013 then Romney's best bet to build on his last debate performance is to be relaxed and ready to parry the inevitable counter-attacks, especially the Clinton-inspired \"Here's old moderate Mitt\" line.</p> <h2>Paul Harris:</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397827788\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/red/blue_pics/2010/10/13/paulharris_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Harris byline photo\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Harris byline</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lisa Carpenter/guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Obama:</strong> Obama can hardly do worse than last time. That, perversely, will be an advantage in this debate. Both the media chattering classes and Democratic voters are looking for Obama to show some spirit, defend his record and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 attack Romney. Any move in those directions will thus be seen as an improvement on his last performance. So Obama's task should be easy. He should at least draw the debate. But how does he win it? He has to tread some of the same path as Joe Biden but without the posturing and aggression. He has to firmly rebut and dissect Romney's arguments, but without coming across as a brawler. In some ways that suits Obama's temperament But it is not an easy task. Thus my prediction overall \u2013 a draw.</p> <p><strong>Romney:</strong> This time around, Romney has a tough task. Debates are all about expectations and, unlike in Denver, the new rejuvenated version of Romney (Mitt 2.0) is coming into this debate perceived as a dominant force. So he has to up his game, come across as forceful and dynamic, respectful of the president but also aggressive in his grilling of Obama's record. At the same time, he must push a positive vision and reveal himself to be warm, human and capable of reaching out to ordinary, struggling voters. This is going to be difficult given that Obama is likely to go for his throat. There is chance the words \"47%\" are not going to be flung at him this time.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama cannot afford another bad debate in Long Island tonight after his dismal performance in Denver a fortnight ago that opened way for Mitt Romney's comeback.</p> <p>Obama needs to come out with either a win or a draw. His campaign team said he is better-prepared and energised. But the Romney camp, which showed itself to be adept in preparing for the Denver debate, will have anticipated this.</p> <p>The president faces an additional obstacle tonight, the format being different from the Denver one, with questions coming from the audience rather than a single journalist. </p> <p>Obama needs to hit Romney hard but the town-hall style debate complicates his task. In this format, Obama and Romney will be answering questions mainly from voters in the audience, making it more difficult to be evasive and combative.</p> <p>The tradition is to be civil, though in 2004 there were strong exchanges between then president George W Bush and John Kerry over the Iraq war.</p> <p>The audience in the hall and those watching at home will expect answers to questions rather than the politician's trick of switching almost immediately to another topic.</p> <p>With the president and Romney theoretically free to wander round the stage in this format, there is also more emphasis on body language than there was when the two are stuck at a podium or in their seats. Romney's team said the candidate has devoted a lot of attention in his preparations to this.</p> <p>A Pew poll published Monday showed 41% expected Obama to do better and 37% Romney, a change from before the Denver debate when 51% expected Obama to do win and 29% Romney.</p> <h2>The format</h2> <p>Town-hall debates on the campaign trail and in at least one past presidential election had a element of spontaneity about them. These days they are more controlled.</p> <p>Gallup chooses 80 questioners representing a cross-section of likely voters, the questions screened in advance, and the moderator, Candy Crowley, chooses a dozen or more from the 80.</p> <p>After a question is asked, Obama and Romney have two minutes each to respond followed by exchanges.</p> <p>The two campaigns jointly approached the organisers on Friday to protest over comments made by Crowley that she saw her role as being more than just a fly on the wall and intended to ask follow-up questions. The campaigns wanted an assurance the debate is primarily for the audience to ask questions and that Crowley would not seek too big a role.</p> <p>Crowley, a veteran news reporter and anchorwoman who likes to generate news, is unlikely to be fazed by this. Expect her to vigorously pursue follow-up questions.</p> <h2>The strategies</h2> <p>Obama was left looking in the Denver debate at times as if Romney was the president and he was the challenger. He needs to be assertive in a way he failed to be in Denver.</p> <p>To lift the morale of Democrats still upset over his previous outing, he has to go negative for at least some of the debate in spite of the limitations of the format.</p> <p>His campaign team has hinted he will be aggressive, digging into areas where Romney is seen as weak: the 47% comment from the secret video, his record at Bain Capital, and his vague tax and deficit-reduction plans.</p> <p>He also has to convey pride, as Bill Clinton succeeded in doing at the party convention and vice-president Joe Biden did to some extent in last week's debate, in the achievements of his first term and to signal what he will do in a second.</p> <p>It is easier for Romney. With one win behind him, he can afford to settle for a draw. He will seek to consolidate his march towards the centre ground. He can exploit Obama's vulnerabilities, especially his administration's conflicting accounts of what happened in the Benghazi consulate attack.</p> <h2>The issues</h2> <p>With the questions coming from the audience rather than the moderator, what issues might come up are theoretically unpredictable. But, given they are screened first, the chances are that key domestic and foreign issues are almost certain to crop up.</p> <p>In the months running up to the election. the widespread consensus was that foreign affairs was unlikely to play much part in a campaign dominated by unemployment. But the death of US ambassador Chris Stevens and three others in the Benghazi consulate attack is an emotive issue, one on which Obama is vulnerable because of conflicting statements from his administration.</p> <p>While Obama is at the mercy of the audience, he has to try to find a way \u2013 if it is not raised by one of the questioners \u2013 to get in comments about Romney's 47% remark about freeloading Americans, which he failed to do in Denver. He will also want to press more forcefully than he managed in Denver on how Romney plans to both cut taxes for the wealthy and cut the deficit at the same time.</p> <p>Romney will seek to push the message that, as a former businessman, he is better suited for stewardship of the economy than Obama, though the president can respond by pointing to the latest unemployment figures showing a drop to 7.8%.</p> <h2>Preparations</h2> <p>Obama has devoted more time to preparation, having cleared his diary since Friday, apart from one dinner engagement that evening. He has been holed up at a resort near colonial Williamsburg, Virginia, since Saturday and will head to Hempstead, Long Island, this afternoon for the debate.</p> <p>As with the preparations for the first debate in Denver, senator John Kerry is playing the role of Romney and Obama's head of communications, Anita Dunn, is playing Crowley.</p> <p>Romney practised in Ohio on Saturday night and since Sunday at a house outside Boston, Massachusetts, with senator Rob Portman as Obama and, in a piece of gender-switching, one of Romney's aides Peter Flaherty as Crowley.</p> <p>The Republican presidential candidate devoted a lot of time in the run-up to Denver to what he said and how he would say it but his campaign team said he is looking a lot at body language this time round, given the freedom to move round the stage.</p> <h2>Past town-hall style presidential debates</h2> <p>The town-hall style was introduced for televised presidential debates on October 15, 1992 and had an immediate impact. Unlike tonight, the questions were not screened in advance.</p> <p>Then president George Bush Sr was knocked off his stride when a woman asked him about the personal impact of the national debt. He looked at his watch as she began her question, a gesture that was interpreted as being impatient and went down badly among television viewers.</p> <p>He compounded the error by offering up a jumbled reply whereas Bill Clinton moved across the stage towards the questioner and spoke about the impact he had witnessed on people in Arkansas, where he was governor.</p> <p>In 2004, George W Bush appeared flustered when asked to name three mistakes he had made as president.</p> <h2>Final debate</h2> <p>The third and final presidential debate will be held next Monday at Lynn University, Boca Raton, Florida.</p>",

I don't think they wanted anything about that on Mock the Week.\" Their \"ban\" \u2013 if ban it was \u2013 was not exactly totalitarian in its application, given that Andy Parsons went on to crack a joke about Savile on that night's episode, <a href=\"http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2012/10/12/16303/bbc_banned_jimmy_savile_jokes_on_mock_the_week\" title=\"\">as Chortle reports</a>. The sense that the Beeb is covering it's back isn't confined to the rightwing press, however. A commenter on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/oct/10/blackadder-zach-galifianakis-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">last week's Laughing Stock column</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18842857\" title=\"\">PoorButNotAChav</a>, was convinced that reflections on the Savile story were suppressed on HIGNFY and Mock the Week: \"How can [these shows] continue to claim to be satirical if their response to the biggest news story of the week is either embarrassed silence or corporate spin? \u2026 If the BBC has exerted pressure on comedians, presenters and guests to toe a corporate line on the Savile story it should be ashamed of itself, and those people who willingly toed the line should be ashamed of themselves.\"</p> <h2>My pick of the best reader comments</h2> <p>Last week's news story about a rediscovered Blackadder script attracted comment, including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18774683\" title=\"\">one from MZophiel</a> that surely raised a smile among fans of the series:</p> <blockquote> <p>Imagine they made another Blackadder.

You could start at Mr T \u2026 or just head for James Brown.</p> <p>I saw Raw for the first time in years last week, and that's a little more uncomfortable throughout \u2026 In Delirious he's still fresh-faced and mostly sticks to family and pop-culture for his material (plus some really, really funny jokes about slavery). I understand why the purists go for Pryor, but to me Murphy was just screamingly funny, the great gags come every 10 seconds in Delirious.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, a touching tale posted by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18880030\" title=\"\">DONT</a> after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/oct/15/stephen-k-amos-review1\" title=\"\">my own review of standup Stephen K Amos</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>I saw Stephen K Amos at the Comedy Store in Manchester on my 18th birthday. Somehow he'd gotten wind of it being the official day I enter into manhood and proceeded to rip into me for being young throughout \u2026 Towards the end of the show Amos called me out again and said, \"Every time you masturbate during the next week, you'll see this,\" and he then pulled the most hideous gurn I have ever seen in my life \u2026 Now, over six years later I still see that monstrous gurn. Every time I think of sexual thoughts it's there, haunting me. Every time I get a girl into bed, all I see is Stephen K Amos' face laughing at me.</p> </blockquote> <p>Which I think means it's time to call it a day. See you next week.</p>",

  "<p>Mitt Romney has pulled <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/11/mitt-romney-leads-national-polls\">even, (or even slightly ahead, in national polls</a> with President Obama since their first debate. The problem for the Republican is that this election will be won in a handful of key states. As I've pointed out in the past, and as <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/15/2012-polls-obama-battleground_n_1966564.html\">Huffington Post's Mark Blumenthal emphasised Monday</a>, Romney seems to have a swing-state problem.</p> <p>The balloons on the Guardian's <a href=\"http://www.ismittromneythepresident.com/\">Is Mitt Romney the President?</a> interactive graphic tell the story. Based on state polling, Romney would lose the electoral college by 294 to 244 electoral votes. Even adding in Virginia, where the <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2012-virginia-president-romney-vs-obama\">HuffPollster aggregate</a> has Romney slightly ahead, Romney is still down 281 to 257.</p> <p>This leaves Romney 13 electoral votes shy of an outright electoral college majority, and 12 electoral votes shy of a tie (the latter would likely result in a Romney presidency given that Republicans will hold a majority of delegations in the House of Representatives in 2013).</p> <p>So, how does Romney get over the top?</p> <p>Let's assume that Romney wins all the states I believe he's leading right now. Let's also assume Obama wins all the states where he holds at least a 3 percentage point lead. That leaves with five states where he can win, but isn't ahead at this moment: Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio, and Wisconsin.</p> <p><strong>Ohio</strong></p> <p>Ohio has 18 electoral votes; taking these would result in Romney earning 275 electoral votes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397791154\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/15/1350335705463/Ohiomap_460.jpg\" alt=\"Ohio electoral map\" width=\"460\" height=\"342\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The polling hasn't <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/sites/default/files/ohio%20post%20debate.gif\">exactly been consistent</a> in the Buckeye state. There are polls with Romney ahead, some with him just behind, and others giving Obama an approximate 5-point lead. Some have said Romney trails because of his <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2012/08/26/159987867/romneys-auto-bailout-stance-complicates-campaign-in-battleground-ohio\">opposition to the auto bailout</a>. Either way, it is the state with the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/2012-presidential-campaign-visits/\">most candidate visits</a> and the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DomenicoNBC/status/257895438580056064\">most money spent on television ads</a> except Florida. Ohio is also a state that is rarely more than a point more Democratic than the national vote, which suggests the closer polls could very well be right. </p> <p><strong>Nevada and Iowa</strong></p> <p>Without Ohio, Romney has to win at least two states. Iowa and Nevada look like two possibilities, with six electoral votes each, for a combined 12. This would get him to the minimum 269 electoral votes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397791155\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/15/1350335740918/nevadamap_460.jpg\" alt=\"Nevada electoral map\" width=\"460\" height=\"335\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/nv/nevada_romney_vs_obama-1908.html\">polling in Nevada</a> has been close for most of the year, yet Romney has only led in one poll conducted in 2012. It's <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/blog/electionate/108604/nevadas-democratic-registration-numbers-jeopardizes-romneys-chances\">also a state</a> where Democrats have run up registration and where the polls have often overestimated Republican strength. On the plus side for Romney, it's a state with a <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/03/politics/nevada-mormons/index.html\">large Mormon population</a>. Also, the pollsters who performed well in Nevada in the last few elections are not showing Obama with any greater advantage than other polls. </p> <p>Iowa is an interesting state in that there really isn't a middle ground. Its Democrats are very liberal, and its Republicans are very conservative. Romney led in a <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/ia/iowa_romney_vs_obama-1922.html\">number of polls</a> earlier in the year. He seemingly fell behind by more than 5 points in September. There are some signs that he's making some progress in the state, but it's a state with few polls recently. We'll need to see more data before knowing if it truly can be a staging-post for Romney's march towards the White House.</p> <p>This map might not be too alluring in that a tie in the electoral college <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/sep/28/us-electoral-college-explained\">risks a split-party presidency</a>. Romney may have the necessary seats in the House to get elected, yet it is quite possible that Democrats will control the 50 seats in the Senate in the event of a tie, which would get Biden elected vice-president. I can't imagine this scenario \"intrigues\" Romney's team much.</p> <p><strong>Wisconsin and New Hampshire</strong></p> <p>The easiest way to avoid a tie without Ohio is to win Wisconsin and its 10 electoral votes. Then, all Romney would need is to win any other state. For this scenario, we add New Hampshire's four electoral votes for a total of 271.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397791156\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/15/1350335776623/Wisconsinmap_460.jpg\" alt=\"Wisconsin electoral map\" width=\"460\" height=\"347\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Wisconsin is probably only in play because of Paul Ryan. After selecting Ryan as his vice-presidential nominee, Romney's numbers <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/17/paul-ryan-wisconsin-effect-us-political-map\">took off in the Badger state</a>. They dropped in September, and now Obama seems to have <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/wi/wisconsin_romney_vs_obama-1871.html\">a small lead</a> \u2013 though one even smaller than Ohio's. </p> <p>The issue is that Romney hasn't been in the state at all in the last month. He's visited North Carolina \u2013 a state where most would agree Romney has an edge \u2013 twice. It makes me wonder whether Romney's polling indicates something the public polls do not. It could be that Obama's right on the edge of 50% in Wisconsin and getting a plurality will prove tough for the former Massachusetts governor. </p> <p>New Hampshire is a contest that, before the primary season, I would have put in Romney's column. He led in pretty much all the <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/nh/new_hampshire_romney_vs_obama-2030.html\">2011 polls</a>, was governor right next door, and owns a summer home in New Hampshire. Then something happened. </p> <p>Romney didn't lead in a single poll from mid-April through mid-September. The Granite state's mix of old-time libertarianism, an influx of liberal out-of-state residents on the Vermont border, and tax-fleeing Bay staters from Romney's home state, makes for a hard-to-figure concoction. There have been very few polls in New Hampshire recently, but the ones since mid-September point to a potentially tight race.</p> <p><strong>Other scenarios</strong></p> <p>It's quite possible that Romney will lose a state that I've put in his column for this exercise \u2013 such as Colorado, Florida, or especially Virginia. The reason none of my scenarios includes these states is I'm assuming that if Romney wins any of the states described in the three scenarios above, then he'd have won the states I automatically put into his column.</p> <p>In the same vein, it wouldn't be a complete shocker if Romney takes a state that I have not given him or which does not conform to one of these scenarios. That might be <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/pa/pennsylvania_romney_vs_obama-1891.html\">Pennsylvania</a>, where Romney seems to be closing the gap. It seems unlikely though that Romney would win a state like Pennsylvania without already carrying enough electoral votes from other states to put him over the top in the electoral college arithmetic.</p> <p>Thus, Romney's path to the White House seems dependent on winning <em>either</em> Ohio, <em>or</em> Iowa and Nevada, <em>or</em> Wisconsin and one other state.</p>",

I've learned that respect and trust are the most important currencies any writer has. I will work harder to maintain them. It's a privilege to have this job. I look forward to continuing the conversation with you for a long time to come.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The majority of the readers' comments - now disabled - were supportive of Wente, welcoming her back to her column. But there was severe criticism too, such as this one:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Ms Wente's apology for her actions (going back at least three years) remains self-serving, misleading, incomplete and woefully inadequate.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Following the plagiarism furore, Wente was <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/1262202--cbc-suspends-margaret-wente-from-media-panel-following-plagiarism-allegations\">suspended by CBC Radio from its media panel on an arts and culture show</a>.</p> <p>And the Globe &amp; Mail has come in for renewed criticism from Carol Wainio, the woman who exposed Wente's \"lapses\", <a href=\"http://mediaculpapost.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/the-globe-and-mail-driving-home-point.html\">for censoring online comments.</a> They are, in fact, moderated.</p> <p><em>Source:</em> <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/commentary/romney-and-obama-consultant-vs-professor/article4602825/\">Globe &amp; Mail</a></p>",

The president and the vice-president wouldn't be knowledgeable about specific decisions that are made by security professionals [who are] the ones who weigh all of the threats and the risks and the needs and make a considered decision.\"</p> <p>Mitt Romney's campaign has hammered the administration over the security breach and its different explanations of how it happened. Romney is expected to continue the line of attack in Tuesday's debate.</p> <p>The issue gained traction during last week's vice-presidential debate when Joe Biden said the White House had been unaware of requests to bolster security at the consulate. That appeared to contradict testimony from state department officials who said requests had been made and rejected.</p> <p>A diplomatic cable presented to a congressional oversight and government reform committee tasked with investigating the affair showed that Stevens asked the state department for an additional 11 security personnel weeks before the attack. Republicans have demanded the administration reveal who knew what and when, saying there was a lack of transparency and that the attack showed the failure of Obama's Middle East foreign policy.</p> <p>On Sunday David Axelrod, a key member of the president's inner circle, said Romney was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/14/obama-campaign-romney-exploiting-benghazi\">\"working hard to exploit the issue\"</a> for political gain.</p> <p>Clinton's remarks on Monday tried to draw the fire by saying neither Obama nor Biden was involved in the decision. \"I want to avoid some kind of political gotcha,\" she said, shortly after arriving in Lima for a conference on women and entrepreneurship.</p> <p>Commentators said it was an attempt to shield the president. \"This was a purely political move to <a href=\"http://www.therightscoop.com/fox-report-hillary-clinton-takes-full-responsibility-for-benghazi-attacks-sorta/\">give Obama breathing room tomorrow night</a>. That's it,\" said <a href=\"http://www.therightscoop.com/\">therightscoop.com</a>.</p> <p>The secretary of state rebuffed criticism that administration officials continued to depict the attack as a spontaneous backlash against an anti-Islam film even after evidence emerged showing it was planned beforehand by a radical, well-armed group.</p> <p>In the immediate aftermath of such events there was always \"confusion\" and \"fog of war\", Clinton said. She described an \"intense, long ordeal\" for staffers at the state department on the night of the attack as they struggled to find out what was happening and respond.</p> <p>Clinton said her mission now was to make sure such an attack never happened again but that diplomacy, even in perilous parts of the Arab world, must continue. \"We can't not engage,\" she said. \"We cannot retreat.\"</p>"
