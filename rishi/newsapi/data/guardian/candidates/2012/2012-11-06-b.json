Who will robocall what lie, what machine will break, <strong>who will <em>steal the election</em></strong> in any of the few remaining battleground states? One YouTube of a voting machine not registering someone's Obama vote, and everyone's on edge all day.</p> <p>In Fairfax, Virginia, the largest county in the state that sits along the red-blue line dividing \"Old Virginia\" \u2013 Southern, white \u2013 from \"New Virginia\" \u2013 young people, professionals, yuppies, minorities, and other non-Real Americans \u2013 the elementary schools that serve as polling stations are enveloped in surveillance. What if there's some kind of organized racket or voting machine issue that screws up the tally in one of the most important counties in the country? It would only be surprising if someone didn't give it a shot.</p> <p>So that's why outside of Mosby Woods School in the residential town of Vienna, Virginia, the end of the DC Metro's Orange subway line, we weren't the only ones waiting to badger voters as they tried to perform their civic duty in peace and quiet.</p> <p>Three Republican party volunteers greeted all incoming voters with sample-ballots. Voters were then handed off to an Asian-American voters' activist, who ensured that members of this large international community in Fairfax had everything in order and understood where they needed to go.</p> <p>Two poll watchers, at the door, and more along the way, through the long line that was about to get much longer as the workday ended.</p> <p>And then, when they exited, two other Asian-American voters' activists offering surveys in at least Chinese and Korean \u2013 one voter requested Tibetan \u2013 followed by a voting machine monitor to keep track of malfunctions, and lastly, a Guardian reporter asking them personal questions about their politics, for publication.</p> <p>We chose to visit Mosby Woods after reading an early-day blurb about a voting machine failure there. Was this a scandalous failure, designed to suppress the Asian-American vote which went 62% nationally for President Obama in 2008? Was someone <em>stealing the election at this very elementary school?</em></p> <p>Nope. The voting machine monitor explained that the thing just had a glitch, or stalled for a minute. It slowed down the process, briefly, but the flow of voters resumed shortly afterwards. Not a big deal, at all.</p> <p>Now where's the fun in that, when every glitch reported across the country doesn't turn out to be a breathtaking scandal?</p> <p><em>Jim Newell</em></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-06T22:43:43.528Z\">at 10.43pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50999062b579f74bac764bba\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-06T22:34:10.699Z\">10.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>What happened to the supposed falloff in <strong>voter enthusiasm</strong> from 2008?

I first thought the calibration was off and tried selecting Jill Stein to actually highlight Obama. Nope. Jill Stein was selected just fine. Next I deselected her and started at the top of Romney's name and started tapping very closely together to find the 'active areas'. From the top of Romney's button down to the bottom of the black checkbox beside Obama's name was all active for Romney. From the bottom of that same checkbox to the bottom of the Obama button (basically a small white sliver) is what let me choose Obama. Stein's button was fine. All other buttons worked fine.</p> <p>I asked the voters on either side of me if they had any problems and they reported they did not. I then called over a volunteer to have a look at it. She him hawed for a bit then calmly said \"It's nothing to worry about, everything will be OK.\" and went back to what she was doing. I then recorded this video.</p> <p>There is a lot of speculation that the footage is edited. I'm not a video guy, but if it's possible to prove whether a video has been altered or not, I will GLADLY provide the raw footage to anyone who is willing to do so.

For every inch above normal rainfall, overall turnout drops by a little less than 1%, but Democratic turnout drops by 2.5%. Every inch above average snowfall decreases turnout by 0.5%. Since the water equivalent of 10 inches of snow usually equals an inch of rain, it's more likely snow will effect an election. [...]</p> <p>Florida is the one state where rain could change have more an impact. There will be showers in the northern half of the state including the key I-4 corridor. Even so, the race would have to be about a point to a point and a half tighter than polling average for the weather to have an effect.</p> </blockquote> <p>Harry takes a more in-depth look at the forecasts for different parts of 10 swing states <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/06/election-day-weather-forecast-florida\">here</a>. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-509927dab579f74bac764b8d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-06T15:08:10.246Z\">3.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>The Guardian's Ed Pilkington is in <strong>Cheviot, Ohio</strong>, a suburb of Cincinnati in Hamilton county in the south-west of the state:</em></p> <p>Carol Ann McIlmurray, 56, is precisely the kind of person Romney needs to attract in large numbers here today.

But others were allowed to stand, including the cutting of the number of days for early voting which contributed to the huge queues that meant some people <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/05/campaigns-legal-battles-swing-states\">waited more than eight hours to cast a ballot</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>The Republicans say the new measures were necessary to combat fraud. But as the American Civil Liberties Union has noted, more people are attacked by sharks in Florida than convicted of election fraud.&#xa0;That has helped fire up some of the president's supporters who see Florida's Republican party machinations as trampling on their democratic rights.&#xa0;</p> <p>But many Republicans who declined to vote for John McCain four years ago because he was not conservative enough, care less about the candidate they will be supporting this time than the opportunity to get rid of Obama.

What happens here today could well determine the outcome of the whole presidential race: Mitt Romney really needs to win this state if he is to have a chance of unseating Barack Obama from the White House.</p> <p>I'm going to spend today on a triangular journey through the electoral landscape of one large section of the state to sample its diversity of political complexion. There's going to be a lot of driving involved across Ohio's monotonously flat plains, but I'll be counting on country music and the rants of Rush Limbaugh on talk radio to keep me going.</p> <p>First stop is a suburb of Cincinnati, one of Romney's most crucial target areas and where Obama campaigned Sunday (see picture below). This area is traditionally very conservative, the heartland of Ohio's God-fearing, straight-living south-western people. But in 2008 Obama became only the second Democratic presidential candidate to win in Hamilton county in which Cincinnati is situated since Lyndon Johnson in 1964.</p> <p>After that, it's a two-hour drive due north to Greenville, a country town in the rural west of Ohio. This is pure Republican country, dependable and unwavering. McCain swept Darke county in which Greenville is located by a resounding 68% to Obama's 30%.</p> <p>The outcome here is not in doubt \u2013 for such a deep red county to turn blue would require a magician to pour some potent liberal potion into the local drinking water. But it will be interesting to see how dyed-in-the-wool conservatives are feeling about Romney's prospects, and the future of the country if he loses tonight.</p> <p>Then I will cut across country due east to the state capital, Columbus. The city is very mixed politically. It has a buzzing university scene as home to Ohio state university, which lends it a lot of Democratic-voting young people. In 2008 Obama won Franklin county around Columbus handsomely, by 59% to McCain's 40%.</p> <p>But the city also acts as the state's main financial centre and has a deep conservative tradition. I'll go to a polling station in a northern suburb, where political opinion is very mixed to take soundings there about which way the wind is blowing.</p> <p><em>Ed Pilkington in Cincinnati</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-1468dee4-e522-4638-9e06-3a9ee2c297c8\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/6/1352207674001/4de6e7c6-bc92-4f8a-9331-b0ecbfa5555b-460.jpeg\" alt=\"President Barack Obama greets supporters as he arrives at a campaign rally in Cincinnati, Ohio, on 4 November, 2012.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President Barack Obama greets supporters as he arrives at a campaign rally in Cincinnati, Ohio, on Sunday.

And welcome to our election day live blog.</strong> After 523 days on the trail for Mitt Romney, 101 campaign rallies for Barack Obama and <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2012/10/2012-election-spending-will-reach-6.html\">more than $6bn</a> in campaign spending from all directions, the day has finally arrived. About 100 million Americans are going to enter a booth or lean over a machine and vote today (<a href=\"http://elections.gmu.edu/early_vote_2012.html\">nearly 32 million</a> have voted already). With any luck we'll know who the winner is sometime tonight.</p> <p>Every presidential election is significant. That's true of this one, only more so. The candidates have described sharply contrasting plans to strengthen the economy, secure the nation and attack the debt. They are beholden to constituencies with radically different visions of what an ideal American society would look like, what rights it would guarantee and what laws it would enforce. Apart from the alma mater they share, the candidates differ in their life stories and as men, in their casts of mind, in their approaches to problems and to people. Both are outsiders, in their ways. After today's election, the story of each man will be rewritten for good. As will the country's.</p> <p><strong>Our correspondents are on the ground in eight battleground states to cover the action at the polls.</strong> We'll be talking to voters all day long to find out how they cast their ballots and why. We'll watch out for polling station delays or irregularities. We'll also keep an eye on the campaigns as team Obama hunkers down in Chicago and team Romney skips from Cleveland to Pittsburgh to Boston.</p> <p><strong><strong>The first polls close tonight at 6pm ET and </strong>we'll be bringing you comprehensive coverage of the results as they come in.</strong> Polls close in the key swing state of Ohio at 7.30 pm ET, although results out of there are not likely to be announced until hours later.

  "<p>Americans were still voting as this edition of the Guardian went to press. The last flurry of opinion polls at both <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/polls/\" title=\"\">state and national level </a> pointed narrowly towards the re-election of Barack Obama as president. If that has been confirmed in the ballot box, it is welcome news for America and the world. It will have an important steadying effect for progressive politics at home and abroad. But nothing could be assumed: the poll margins were tight, as they had often been throughout the 2012 campaign.</p> <p>The candidates campaigned until the bitter end in the hope of shifting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/06/election-day-campaigning-us-president\" title=\"\">the final undecideds</a>. The earliest result of all, in the nocturnal voting ritual in Dixville Notch in upstate New Hampshire, was an ominous tie. The mood elsewhere on election day was tense, an unmistakable contrast with the expectations four years ago that Mr Obama was heading towards the comfortable win he secured. This time the outcome cannot be assumed at all.</p> <p>What can be said with confidence, however, is that these 2012 elections have once again revealed America as a sharply divided society, Dixville Notch writ large. Whoever has won the presidency this time has won it by a relatively small margin, more in line with the elections of 2000 and 2004 \u2013 though hopefully this time the contest will not be settled in the courts. Yet unless Mitt Romney has overnight led the Republicans back to a clean sweep of the White House, the Senate (where a third of the seats were up for election) and the House of Representatives (where all of them were), mandates and power in Washington are again likely to be shared between the parties.</p> <p>If recent years on Capitol Hill are any guide, this is likely to be a recipe for further confrontation, impasse and political dysfunction. Few of America's problems are likely to be resolved in Washington over the next few years \u2013 starting with the \"fiscal cliff\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/04/us-election-economic-woes-obama\" title=\"\">confronting the US in January</a>. Americans are therefore likely to become even more dissatisfied with their politicians and their institutions than they are already \u2013 good news for radicals of the left and the right alike.</p> <p>It is tempting to assume that these divides are acquiring deeper permanency after the brief Democratic surge in 2008. It will be tragic if it is so. Part of the tragedy would be the deepening of the embittered nature of American public life, epitomised on the right by the motor-mouth bias of Fox News and the shock-jock radio shows, and on the left by parts of the blogosphere and social media.</p> <p>Another loss, already powerfully illustrated in this election, would be the increasing&#xa0;campaign focus on a few battleground states and counties at the expense of the virtual neglect of the rest of the country. Mr Obama and Mr Romney seemed only to visit some of the US's largest states, like California, New York and Texas, <a href=\" http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Obama-pursues-base-bucks-in-California-3930415.php\" title=\"\">for fundraising purposes</a>, not for campaigning, because these&#xa0;states' votes were not in doubt. This skews the campaign, the debate and the election. We in Britain are just as bad.</p> <p>The results certainly suggest deep polarisation in America, yet while there is <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/columns/political-connections/whatever-the-outcome-election-will-leave-half-the-nation-alienated-20121101\" title=\"\">plenty of literature</a> to support this analysis, it would be wrong to pretend that America is riven by disagreement as deep and unchangeable as the Grand Canyon. American demographics are moving the Democrats' way, and the polarisation of 2012 may owe more to disappointment in Mr Obama and the general unpopularity of incumbents in hard economic times than to a fresh sharpening of the culture wars.</p> <p>In theory, opinion surveys imply that the newly elected president has real scope to unite America around more moderate positions on everything from defence spending to gay partnerships than the \"divided America\" stereotype ever suggests. Whether that will happen in practice is another matter. The record is not good. Mr Obama was given no chance to be a uniter during his first term. All the same, Americans are in many ways much closer to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/w/wolfe-nation.html\" title=\"\">one-nation politics</a> than the votes they cast yesterday would suggest.</p>",
  "<p>On the nauseating political doublespeak scale, David Cameron's claim to \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/nov/05/david-cameron-arms-sales-gulf\" title=\"\">support the Arab spring</a>\" on a trip to sell weapons to Gulf dictators this week hit a new low. No stern demands for free elections from the autocrats of Arabia \u2013 or calls for respect for human rights routinely dished out even to major powers like Russia and China.</p> <p>As the kings and emirs crack down on democratic protest, the prime minister assured them of his \"respect and friendship\". Different countries, he explained soothingly in Abu Dhabi, needed \"different paths, different timetables\" on the road to reform: countries that were western allies, spent billions on British arms and sat on some of the world's largest oil reserves in particular, he might have added by way of explanation.</p> <p>Cameron went to the Gulf as a salesman for BAE Systems \u2013 the private arms corporation that makes Typhoon jets \u2013 drumming up business from the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Oman, as well as <a href=\"smoothing\" title=\"\">smoothing ruffled</a> feathers over British and European parliamentary criticism of their human rights records on behalf of BP and other companies.</p> <p>No wonder the prime minister restricted media coverage of the jaunt. But, following hard on the heels of a similar trip by the <a href=\"http://www.nation.co.ke/News/world/Frances+Hollande+discusses+Syria+Iran/-/1068/1611680/-/xsdoy1z/-/index.html\" title=\"\">French president</a>, the western message to the monarchies was clear enough: Arab revolution or not, it's business as usual with Gulf despots.</p> <p>The spread of protest across the Arab world has given these visits added urgency. A year ago, in the wake of the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt, it seemed the Gulf regimes and their western backers had headed off revolt by crushing it in Bahrain, buying it off in Saudi Arabia, and attempting to hijack it in Libya and then Syria \u2013 while successfully playing the anti-Shia sectarian card.</p> <p>But popular unrest has now reached the shores of the Gulf. In Kuwait, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/02/kuwait-protests-arab-spring\" title=\"\">tens of thousands of demonstrators</a>, including Islamists, liberals and nationalists, have faced barrages of teargas and stun grenades as they protest against a rigged election law, while all gatherings of more than 20 have been banned.</p> <p>After 18 months of violent suppression of the opposition in Bahrain, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/14/bahrain-military-equipment-uk\" title=\"\">armed by Britain</a> and America, the regime has outlawed all anti-government demonstrations. In western-embraced Saudi Arabia, protests have been brutally repressed, as thousands are held without charge or proper trial.</p> <p>Meanwhile, scores have been<a href=\"http://www.echr.org.uk/\" title=\"\"> jailed in the UAE</a> for campaigning for democratic reform, and in Britain's favourite Arab police state of Jordan, protests have mushroomed against a Kuwaiti-style electoral stitchup. London, Paris and Washington all express concern \u2013 but arm and back the autocrats.</p> <p>Cameron insists they <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/9655254/David-Cameron-defends-legitimate-arms-deals-during-Gulf-states-tour.html\" title=\"\">need weapons to defend themselves</a>. When it comes to the small arms and equipment Britain and the US supply to Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and other Gulf states, he must mean from their own people. But if he's talking about fighter jets, they're not really about defence at all.</p> <p>This is effectively a mafia-style protection racket, in which Gulf regimes use oil wealth their families have commandeered to buy equipment from western firms they will never use. The companies pay huge kickbacks to the relevant princelings, while a revolving door of political corruption provides lucrative employment for former defence ministers, officials and generals with the arms corporations they secured contracts for in office.</p> <p>Naturally, western leaders and Arab autocrats claim the Gulf states are threatened by Iran. In reality, that would only be a risk if the US or Israel attacked Iran \u2013 and in that case, it would be the US and its allies, not the regimes' forces, that would be defending them. Hypocrisy doesn't begin to describe this relationship, which has long embedded corruption in <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/06/arms-bosses-plot-1996-archive\" title=\"\">a web of political, commercial and intelli gence links</a> at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jan/16/bae.immigrationpolicy?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">heart of British public life</a>.</p> <p>But support for the Gulf dictatorships \u2013 colonial-era feudal confections built on heavily exploited foreign workforces \u2013 is central to western control of the Middle East and its energy resources. That's why the US has major military bases in Kuwait, Qatar, the UAE, Oman and Bahrain.</p> <p>The danger now is of escalating military buildup against Iran and intervention in the popular upheavals that have been unleashed across the region. Both the US and Britain have sent troops to Jordan in recent months to bolster the tottering regime and increase leverage in the Syrian civil war. Cameron held talks with emirates leaders this week about setting up a permanent British military airbase in the UAE.</p> <p>The prime minister defended arms sales to dictators on the basis of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/nov/05/david-cameron-gulf-arms-trip\" title=\"\">300,000 jobs in Britain's \"defence industries\"</a>. Those numbers are inflated and in any case heavily reliant on <a href=\"http://www.caat.org.uk/issues/bae/wasted-skills.php\" title=\"\">government subsidy</a>. But there's also no doubt that British manufacturing is over-dependent on the arms industry and some of that support could usefully be diverted to, say, renewable technologies.</p> <p>But even if morality and corruption are dismissed as side issues, the likelihood is that, sooner or later, these autocrats will fall \u2013 as did the Shah's regime in Iran, on which so many British and US arms contracts depended at the time. Without western support, they would have certainly been toppled already. As Rached Ghannouchi, the Tunisian leader whose democratic Islamist movement was swept to power in elections last year, predicted: \"<a href=\"http://www.tunisia-live.net/2011/12/22/washington-institute-for-near-east-policy-releases-recording-of-rachid-ghannouchi/\" title=\"\">Next year it will be the turn of monarchies</a>.\" When that happens, the western world risks a new backlash from its leaders' corrupt folly.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SeumasMilne\" title=\"\"><em>@SeumasMilne</em></a></p>",
  "<p>Argentina is braced for a wave of protests against the government of Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, amid growing disquiet over a faltering economy and efforts to clamp down on the media.</p> <p>Activists hope to rally thousands of people on Thursday for a string of demonstrations against a proposed constitutional reform that would allow Fern\u00e1ndez to seek a third term in 2015, and a move to break up the country's main media group.</p> <p>In the five years since Fern\u00e1ndez succeeded her husband N\u00e9stor Kirchner in office, Argentina has grown increasingly polarised between those who argue the president's reforms will create a more egalitarian society, and opponents who accuse her creeping authoritarianism.</p> <p>\"A wide gulf has opened,\" said Jorge Lanata, the chain-smoking journalist whose weekly satirical TV show Periodismo Para Todos (Journalism For All) has helped shift the balance of public opinion.</p> <p>\"On one side you have the government and its supporters who are convinced they are carrying out a revolution \u2013 and it's logical that you shouldn't respect freedom of the press or the constitution if you're engaged in a revolution,\" said Lanata. \"On the other are the people who defend democracy, who are horrified at seeing freedom of the press and the Constitution attacked.\"</p> <p>With Fern\u00e1ndez's political rivals in disarray, the role of the opposition has been taken up by journalists such as Lanata and internet-based activists, such as</p> <p>Mariana Torres, a 41-year-old divorced mother of three who runs one of the main <a href=\"http://facebook.com/pages/EL-ANTI-K/156333624406111\" title=\"\">Facebook pages</a> behind the anti-government protests. \"I started navigating the internet looking for a job when my marriage broke up,\" she says. \"That's when I discovered the Facebook pages that criticize the government.\"</p> <p>Torres's Facebook group and others like it helped muster thousands of saucepan-banging protesters who took to the streets on 13 September after the government's ban on buying dollars \u2013 a move that sparked fury in a nation where US banknotes have long been a safeguard against the fluctuating exchange rates.</p> <p>Fern\u00e1ndez's supporters say the protests are the result of a far-right conspiracy, a charge denied by Torres's fellow Facebook administrator, Marcelo Mor\u00e1n. Although there are a large number of similar anonymously-run pages, Torres and Mor\u00e1n stand out because they have decided to show their faces.</p> <p>\"We do not represent any political party,\" he said. \"On the contrary, we are just as worried about the opposition politicians.\"</p> <p>Lanata admits his programme, which combines hard-hitting reports on corruption with comedy sketches featuring mocking Fern\u00e1ndez and Venezuelan president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, has been a catalyst for dissent. \"In my first programme I said I hoped we could learn to lose our fear, and that seems to have happened: people are now willing to speak out against this government.\"</p> <p>But to the president's supporters Lanata represents the kind of corporate media whose power President Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner has vowed to rein in.</p> <p>\"There is a sector that historically and since the beginning of this government has opposed projects of social inclusion, justice and distribution,\" said the cabinet chief, Juan Manuel Abal Medina after a nationwide rally against constitutional reform in September.</p> <p>\"Those sectors in the past resorted to coup d'\u00e9tats, today they resort to the big media. They are privileged classes who seek to keep their privileges.\"</p> <p>Lanata's show is broadcast on Channel 13, part of the country's largest media conglomerate, which also publishes Argentina's largest newspaper, Clar\u00edn. The group is widely perceived to be the target of a new media law which comes into effect on 7 December, forcing it to sell off its non-print holdings including the largest cable and internet operator in Argentina \u2013 and its main income earner, and possibly the Channel 13.</p> <p>The slogan \"Clar\u00edn Lies\" is printed on banners hanging from government buildings and was emblazoned on the T-shirt of during last year's election campaign.</p> <p>At Clar\u00edn itself the atmosphere is tense. \"We don't know exactly what will happen,\" says managing editor Ricardo Kirschbaum. \"There are rumours the government plans to take over Cablevision that day, which undoubtedly would affect us at the newspaper.\"</p>",
  "<p>The 2012 campaign began before the campaign of 2008 had finished. In February of that year, while Barack Obama was still locked in an epic struggle for the Democratic nomination against Hillary Clinton, Mitt Romney summoned his closest allies to a Boston office to work out why his effort to be the Republicans' standard-bearer of 2008 had failed so badly. He handed out a memo he had written about himself, detailing his strengths and weaknesses, assessing his own defeated candidacy as if it were one of the businesses he once assessed as a hotshot management consultant. This was no mere exercise in navel-gazing. Romney was determined to learn the lessons of defeat in 2008 in order to win in 2012.</p> <p>Thus began a long march that ended today. The visible miles came last winter, when Romney trudged through the pig farms of Iowa and the snows of New Hampshire in his search for the Republican nomination. But that followed an invisible primary, an endless round of closed-door fundraisers to fill up a war-chest he hoped would scare off the most fearsome potential rivals.</p> <p>Whether money was the explanation or not, Romney was indeed rewarded by the decision of several big-beast Republicans not to challenge him for the nomination. The New Jersey governor Chris Christie, Indiana's Mitch Daniels and others, including Sarah Palin, skipped the race, leaving the path open for Romney.</p> <p>When ambitious politicians duck a presidential contest, that's usually because they suspect the incumbent will be too hard to dislodge. In the summer of 2011, that looked like the smart decision. For Obama had just done what George W Bush had failed to do: he had removed \u2013 killed \u2013 Osama bin Laden. Many Republicans concluded that, given the US economy was bound to at least slightly improve by November 2012, the scalp of Bin Laden made the president tough to beat.</p> <p>The course for Romney ran anything but smooth. Instead of warming to the former Massachusetts governor as the obvious choice \u2013 a successful businessman who looked like Hollywood's idea of a president \u2013 Republican primary voters seemed ready to fall in love with almost anyone but him. The field of rivals included outlandish characters who seemed absurd to outsiders: pizza magnate Herman Cain, evolution-denying congresswoman Michelle Bachmann, Texas governor Rick Perry, who could not remember which three government departments he planned to shut down. Former McCain campaign manager Steve Schmidt said: \"The Republican primary resembled a reality-TV show. All these guys might as well have been living in a tree house with Simon Cowell.\"</p> <p>And yet each of those candidates enjoyed a moment in the sun, a surge in support that made them \u2013 rather than Romney \u2013 the frontrunner. It was as if Republicans were desperate to find someone else to nominate. Accordingly, former senator Rick Santorum and the former House speaker Newt Gingrich won enough states between them to ensure the primary race dragged on.</p> <p>That long, bruising primary battle cost Romney dear, and not just financially (it forced him to spend money defeating his fellow Republicans rather than saving it for the fight against Obama). The greater cost was political.</p> <p>It exposed the future Republican nominee to sustained attack from his own side. The notion of Romney as a ruthless plutocrat, coldly laying off American workers, did not come from the Democrat attack machine. Romney was not seen as embodying the 1% because of the Occupy movement. Rather, that portrait was drawn by Gingrich, who aired an extended commercial, \"When Mitt Romney came to Town\", that tore apart Romney's tenure at the helm of the private equity firm Bain &amp; Co. It depicted him as a corporate raider, willing to shutter factories and shatter working lives if it made him richer. That critique lingered all year, eagerly picked up and advanced by the Democrats. But it originated with the Republicans.</p> <p>Still, the damage of the primaries went deeper. To push aside Santorum, Bachmann and the others, Romney was obliged to adopt positions that would endear him to the Republican faithful \u2013 but which stored up trouble for later. So Romney reversed his previous support for abortion rights and gun control, called on undocumented migrants to \"self-deport\" and rebranded himself from a Massachusetts moderate, who as governor had passed healthcare reform, into the \"severe conservative\" who now promised to repeal \"Obamacare\".</p> <p>Those reverses left him doubly wounded. For one thing, he could now be slammed as a serial flip-flopper, just another politician who believed in nothing and would say whatever it took to be elected. For another, he had been boxed into a series of positions bound to alienate core blocs of the electorate that had long been tough for Republicans to reach \u2013 the young, Latinos and suburban women among them.</p> <p>Sure enough, through the summer months he was on the receiving end of an air assault from Obama, in the form of saturation TV ads in key states, which portrayed Romney as part boardroom vulture, part unprincipled phoney. Obama, who had faced no primary challenge of his own, had the money to do it \u2013 defining Romney before he had a chance to define himself.</p> <p>Yet Romney could not just blame Obama. Much of his trouble was of his own making. He helped colour in the cartoon of himself as an out-of-touch one percenter when he boasted that his wife had \"a couple of Cadillacs\" or when his tax returns \u2013 showing that he paid a meagre 14% \u2013 had to be dragged out of him. In July, he botched an overseas tour meant to boost his credentials as a potential world leader by offending America's most easily pleased ally, Britain, when he suggested the London Olympics could be a flop and by travelling to Jerusalem to offer his view that cultural inferiority might be the cause of Palestinian suffering.</p> <p>What should have been a moment to relaunch his candidacy and make Americans look at him anew \u2013 his party convention in Tampa in August \u2013 also had little effect. His speech was overshadowed by a moment of Dadaist theatre, as Clint Eastwood harangued an empty chair standing in for an imaginary Obama. Romney was on his way to becoming a joke figure.</p> <p>In September, he went from being ridiculed to being hated. A leaked video showed him addressing fellow millionaires at a fundraising event in May, where an unplugged Romney candidly wrote off 47% of the electorate as parasites, non-taxpaying dependents who would never vote Republican because they would not \"take responsibility for their own lives\". Even many on his own side believed it was an act of self-destruction so complete that no candidate could possibly survive it.</p> <p>But Romney had one more chance. The first TV debate in Denver on 3 October was, for many Americans, the first time they had paid close attention to the election. What they saw was an incumbent president who looked exhausted, listless and disengaged. With his head down, his answers sluggish, it seemed he either was too tired to be president or no longer really wanted the job.</p> <p>Romney, by contrast, was spirited and energetic. Above all, he came across as a human being rather than the caricature of Obama propaganda: all he had to do was not seem like a rapacious capitalist bloodsucker and, in an instant, he had broken the core message of the Obama campaign. The immediate bounce that Romney enjoyed in the polls suggested that a small chunk of the electorate, disenchanted with the president, had been waiting to see if the Republican was a plausible replacement. In Denver Romney crossed that threshold.</p> <p>That change revealed what had always been the structural reality of this race. By rights, it should always have been close. Here was an incumbent president who had struggled to lift his approval rating above 50%, who had seen the number of Americans saying the US was on the \"wrong track\" become a majority and, most crucially, had watched as the unemployment rate had remained stuck at 8% for almost his entire presidency, shifting below that figure only a matter of weeks ago. The last president to be re-elected with a jobless percentage that high was Franklin Roosevelt in 1940, in what were rather different circumstances.</p> <p>So the election should never have been a cakewalk for Obama. That it had seemed that way, until Denver, attested to the deeply flawed candidacy of Romney. By raising his game at that first debate, he restored politics to something like normal service.</p> <p>Obama conceded that he had messed up, joked that he had been napping in the first encounter and sharpened up for the next two, where he remained clear, focused and unafraid to confront his opponent: in Denver he had failed even to mention Romney's 47% remark. Now he made it his closing argument.</p> <p>But October was a tough month for the president. He was hobbled by accusations that he had bungled or even deceived the public over the September killing of four US diplomats in Benghazi, an issue unlikely to go away. Still the end of the month brought some unlikely and helpful allies.</p> <p>The first was a former nemesis, Bill Clinton, who in 2008 had dismissed Obama's presidential bid as a \"fairytale\". In the campaign's closing days, Obama let the man they call the big dog run \u2013 as the country's most beloved Democrat grew hoarse making the case for his successor. Obama didn't just exploit Clinton's ability to connect to the white, male blue-collar Americans who remain beyond the current president's reach \u2013 he all but ran on Clinton's record, arguing that \"We know my plan works because we've tried it,\" referring to Clinton's success in the 1990s.</p> <p>The second ally was a genuine surprise. Some pollsters doubt that Superstorm Sandy really made a big difference for Obama, noting that Romney's surge, \"Mittmentum\", had already stalled before the weather changed. But few deny that Obama benefited from the chance to be seen doing the job of president, while Romney was sidelined, and profited especially from the bearhug he received from the Republicans' rising star, Chris Christie. His gushing praise for Obama, and refusal to campaign at Romney's side in Pennsylvania, was precious validation for the president \u2013 and it came at just the right time.</p> <p>And so the two men duelled to the very last, Romney making two campaign convention-breaking stops on election day itself. The campaign had finished, but the politics is anything but over.</p>",

  "<p>Looking at numerous pictures that my friends have taken of their voting experiences today, I have one thought: isn't democracy great? </p> <p>Then I have another thought: is it 1959 already? </p> <p>The photos of modern voting rituals in the US seem as if they should be photographed in sepia, and not just because of the old-timey filters are available on Instagram. It's because the voting methods used in the US are ridiculously, mortifyingly outdated.</p> <p>The voting booths themselves, usually in high-school gyms, have hand-lettered signs and have the same basic structure as the tri-panel posterboards for elementary school science-fair projects \u2013 and that's before you get inside.</p> <p>The current, popular method of \"optical scanning\" is not exactly a leap into the future. You fill out a paper ballot, and a machine reads what you have marked. Some of the ballots are several pages long. The paper ballot itself is kept in some dark, dusty box, ostensibly to verify the results \u2013 but really perhaps for future generations \u2013 say, in 2016 \u2013 to laugh at in museums.</p> <p>The optical scanning machines are a sad compromise between paper and electronic voting. The old punch-card voting machines are history and \"hanging chads\" are no more. And yet, in the nation that is the birthplace of Apple, Microsoft and Oracle, we still don't have a digital voting system that works properly. Like skimpy portions in a bad restaurant, the digital voting we have is horrible, and there's not enough of it. Only about 25% of voting machines in the US are digital.</p> <p>And worst of all, the optical scanning method certainly doesn't make for efficient voting. All over Twitter there are reports of voting lines that are two or three hours long \u2013 and that's in places where the machines are working. Reuters reported today that \"Voting at the YMCA on West 63rd Street in Manhattan was delayed because election officials could not find the ballot cards and scanners were not working properly.\"</p> <p>In one key swing county in Virginia, voters who did not have an extra hour on their hands to spend in line left without voting, in order to get to work. </p> <p>The optical scanning method, because it causes delays, also causes an unnecessary economic hit to working-class voters. As Jessica Ann Lee, a senior policy analyst with Brookings Metro, tweeted today: \"For voters who work for hourly wages, long lines are effectively a poll tax (given wages lost due to wait times.)\"</p> <p>Of course, wasted time is not a big boon to the rich, either: you know something is a bad economic scene when Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein reportedly gave up on his mess of a polling station in favor of heading in to work.</p> <p>So why not go electronic? Partly, it's because electronic voting machines lost the fight to dominate polling places, so relatively little effort has gone into making sure they work. Truly electronic voting machines are unreliable and not secure enough; they're like the Apple Maps of election software.</p> <p>They could be improved, of course, if our government worked as hard on managing elections as on winning them. But there's another reason that has kept electronic voting from taking root in America. It's tinfoil \u2013 or rather, wearers of tinfoil hats.</p> <p>Conspiracy theorists love to suggest that electronic votes are hacked, manipulated, or stolen. For instance, there was the mistaken rumor that Tagg Romney, one of Mitt's sons, owned voting machines \u2013 he does not. Just when that had died down, there was a petite panic over a shadowy \"software patch\" in Ohio's election machines, which was debunked by the Awl.</p> <p>This particular fear of electronic voting doesn't make much sense. Electronic voting, if the software were improved, is not any riskier than paper voting. Elections were stolen with paper ballots as they could be with virtual ones. You don't have to think of the allegations that flew in the Bush-Gore fight of 2000; even Rutherford B Hayes and Samuel Tilden had to fight allegations of a stolen presidential election in 1876. Stolen elections, as Jack Shafer once wrote, \"are as American as apple pie.\"</p> <p>Still, the United States likes to think of itself as having the world's most effective democracy \u2013 without coalitions, parliaments or ministers, we see our system as mostly pure, at least in conception. The men we elect to office go there, work together in exactly the numbers the voters determine \u2013 so power-sharing or other complications \u2013 and stay there until we're ready to kick them out. We have seen this as the model for the Arab spring, where the smiling poor, allowed to vote democratically for the first time, proudly held up thumbs swabbed with colored ink: the tattoos, as it were, of freedom.</p> <p>It's been a wonderful and highly exportable ideal, American democracy, and the only way we could ruin it is to make it completely impractical.</p> <p>We are well on that path now. </p> <p>The American poet Robert Frost once wrote, in a poem, about the metaphorical experience of standing among a full harvest of apples, far more than he could ever consume. \"I have had too much of apple-picking,\" the poet writes. \"I am overtired of the great harvest I myself desired.\" </p> <p>With the wrong voting machines, some might end up saying that about the American-style democracy this country worked hundreds of years to build.</p>",
  "<p>The end of the campaign is here. It's been a long journey for many (including your writer). A year ago at this time Mitt Romney was fighting back challengers such as Herman Cain and Newt Gingrich. Romney was eventually able to claw his way to the Republican nomination. Two months ago, he was left for dead by many after a successful Democratic national convention. But Romney came back to near even after the first debate.</p> <p>It now seems that Romney's luck has finally run out. President of the United States Barack Obama looks destined to claim victory at some point this evening or early tomorrow morning in the 2012 presidential election. Why do I have confidence?</p> <p>The polling aggregates are crystal clear. </p> <p><a href=\"fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/04/rasmussen-polls-were-biased-and-inaccurate-quinnipiac-surveyusa-performed-strongly/\">FiveThirtyEight</a>, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/pollster/\">HuffPollster</a> and <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/2012_elections_electoral_college_map_no_toss_ups.html\">Real Clear Politics</a> all have President Obama winning at least 303 electoral votes. The latter two actually have Obama taking 332 electoral votes. Put another way, none of the aggregates really know something the others don't. There's no special formula needed to tell us who will win.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398930774\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/6/1352225524660/-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Election 2012 poll table\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The average of all three pollsters gives Obama 303 electoral votes to Romney's 235.

As of Monday night, the average of all three gives Obama 303 electoral votes to Romney's 235.</p> <p>I'd have to have a very good statistical reason to disagree with the average for me go in another direction. I don't have one. I'll go with Obama 303 to Romney 235 in the electoral college as my prediction.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398930775\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/6/1352226048491/electoral-map-001.jpg\" alt=\"electoral map\" width=\"460\" height=\"341\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">electoral map Photograph: Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Boosting my confidence is that this result is very close to what Drew Linzer at <a href=\"http://votamatic.org/\">Votamatic</a> has been forecasting. He's constantly been estimating Obama with 303 to 332 electoral votes and Romney with 206 to 235 electoral votes. If one person gets a lot of credit for a good call for a long time, I hope it's Drew. </p> <p>I should note that the averages will <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/27/swing-state-polling-electoral-college-arithmetic\">almost always get at least one state wrong</a>. The best chance for that error will be Florida or Virginia. I'm not sure which it is, and I'm not about to go chasing the \"incorrect\" state. Still, an Obama electoral vote total of anywhere from 290 to 332 electoral votes is well within the statistical norm.</p> <p>It also seems unlikely that there will be an electoral/popular vote split. The average of all the aggregates pegs Obama with a 1.6 point popular vote victory, which is what I'll make my final call. Noting the range and past popular vote projection accuracy, anything within a point of 1.6 point margin from 0.6 to 2.6 is perfectly within the margin of error. </p> <p>I will say that Romney isn't completely dead. I'd put the chance of a Romney victory at somewhere between 5 and 10%. That's not large, yet it's not trivial either.</p> <p>A Romney win this evening would be quite surprising, however, given past polling accurate. I can see how he gets to ~260 electoral votes through a series of errors. The necessary 270 to emerge victorious is a big stretch. Romney doesn't lead in a single recent non-partisan Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, or Wisconsin survey. Historically, that is a death knell. </p> <p>The chance of a Romney victory is low enough to ensure that a win by the former governor of Massachusetts would be viewed as a disaster for analysts and pollsters. I'd expect us to have to book an airport Hilton for a month-long special conference on what went wrong in such a scenario. It would also give people reason to question polling for years on end. We can argue over whether that is a good thing or not. </p> <p>At the end of the day, the only way we'll know if I'll need to book a hotel room is to see the results. So go out there and vote America. It's your fundamental right.</p>",
  "<p>It's finally here. Election day. By the end of the night, we'll most likely know who'll be running the country for the next four years. In the blue corner, Barack Obama, rapidly graying but game for another term. In the red corner, Mitt Romney, graying at the temples like a model in a Just For Men commercial and grabbing, desperately, at the job he's been interviewing for for the better part of a decade.</p> <p>Red or blue, regardless of who wins today, one thing is certain: it will take years of work to remedy the harm that has been done to reproductive freedom in the last two years. It will take more than the four years that President Obama would win; and should Romney win, it will take even longer.</p> <p>\"This is not the 1950s,\" <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/burns-haberman/2012/08/obama-campaign-airs-planned-parenthood-ad-this-is-131093.html\">argues one Obama ad</a>, warning about the Romney-Ryan positions on abortion, contraception, and Planned Parenthood. The reality is that, in many parts of the country, that time travel has already occurred, and without their help. In large swaths of the United States, abortion has become inaccessible to many women: too expensive, too time-consuming, too intimidating, too <em>hard</em> to access. </p> <p>A second term for Obama would, of course, be far better for American women than would a President Romney and Vice-President Ryan. Romney, after all, has pledged to cut all federal funding to Planned Parenthood on day one of his presidency. And Ryan, who has been far more consistent in his anti-choice policies, favours a national version of the controversial mandatory transvaginal ultrasound law currently in effect in Texas. The official GOP stance on abortion \u2013 the one in its party platform \u2013 is that all abortions should be illegal, with no exceptions in the case of rape. It also declares that constitutional rights ought to be granted at the moment of conception, taking a cue from the too-extreme-for-Mississippi law that would have banned the pill, the IUD, and in vitro fertilisation.</p> <p>A vote for Obama and the Democrats is a vote against that regressive platform and those \"pro-life\" policies that would let women die rather than allow them abortions. But an Obama win alone won't undo the stunning shifts that have occurred in both law and culture in the last few years. In 2011, state legislators proposed 1,100 reproductive rights-related measures, almost all of them aimed at restricting those rights. That was an increase from 2010's 950 measures. Last year, states enacted a record number of abortion restrictions, as <a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/media/inthenews/2012/01/05/endofyear.html\">the vertiginous line on this graph demonstrates</a>.</p> <p>In addition to legislative changes, the last two years have seen a shift in the national discourse around reproductive rights, in which positions that were once considered extreme \u2013 removing rape and incest exceptions from abortion bans \u2013 became mainstream Republican positions. In the space of just a few years, America has become a country in which an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/31/planned-parenthood-bullying-cancer-charity\">organization dedicated to defeating breast cancer pulls funding</a> from clinics that provide breast cancer screenings in addition to abortions and STI tests, and where politicians with presidential aspirations discuss whether or not the birth control pill should be banned.</p> <p>To those unfamiliar with these issues, it may seem as though the right's fixation on rape, the pill, and ultrasounds has sprung out of nowhere. The truth is far more sobering. A generation ago, when my mother was a vocal young feminist, the pro-choice movement made slow advances towards decriminalising contraception and abortion \u2013 advances that culminated, of course, in the success of arguing a case before the US supreme court and securing 1973's historic Wade v Roe ruling. Similarly, the right's desire to throw up as many obstacles to abortion as possible \u2013 mandatory ultrasounds, waiting periods, higher costs, the impossible-to-meet requirements for clinics <a href=\"http://reproductiverights.org/en/project/targeted-regulation-of-abortion-providers-trap\">known as Trap laws</a> \u2013 has been brewing for some time. Nor did the desire to target hitherto uncontroversial forms of contraception like the pill and the IUD spring fully-formed into existence in 2011. Of course, it was largely thanks to GOP electoral victories, fueled by Tea Party enthusiasm and extremism, that those plans were finally turned into policy.</p> <p>Electoral advantages and groundwork aside, it's my belief that the misogynistic hostility towards women's bodily autonomy, the desire to turn back the clock on gender equality, is part of a reaction to the election of the nation's first African-American president. The sense that America has rolled dangerously far down an undesirable road has not only brought out the hideous racism that until now had mostly lain dormant and covert, but has also fed a desire to undo what the left sees as progress toward gender equality and what conservatives view as the dismantling of everything they hold dear. The re-election of President Obama will, in all likelihood, serve to deepen that sentiment on the right.</p> <p>This is not to argue against re-electing Obama: when you're pissing off America's racists and misogynists, it means you're doing something right. It is simply to warn that a win for Obama will mean a continuation, and even a worsening, of the cultural and legislative trends we've witnessed in the last few years.</p> <p>Regaining the ground lost, and bringing the national discourse back to where it was before this madness began, will take an enormous amount of hard work. It will also take time \u2013 far longer than the four years Obama would have in office. Yes, rights can be stripped away in one or two congressional sessions, but restoring them, and crawling out of this horrendous cultural quagmire, will take many more than that.</p> <p>A victory for Obama will shield America from a president and vice-president who will are eager to appoint anti-Roe justices, and who will be delighted to see abortion and contraception made inaccessible to even more American women. It will prevent the elevation of Paul Ryan, a man who in effect believes, as so many others in his party do, that rape is \"just another method of conception\".</p> <p>Even if Obama wins, those of us who care about reproductive rights will have a hard road ahead of us. No, this is not the 1950s, but when it comes to reproductive freedom, an Obama victory alone will not bring us magically back to 2012. It will not guarantee us a just and progressive future. Regardless of who wins Tuesday, we will have to fight for that future. Again.</p>",

  "<p>It's almost 50 years since Harold Wilson was described as the first British Prime Minister to understand the importance of television. He would probably have boggled had he seen the reach and variety of media on offer in 2012, and it's that media which is set to define the political lives of both American Presidential candidates as they wait to find out who's going to enter or remain in the White House in January.</p> <p>The incumbent President Barack Obama has had the edge in social media since he started engaging through Twitter whilst still a candidate in 2007. Media consultant Alan Stevens from Mediacoach.co.uk gives him a lot of credit for it. \"[Obama] has gathered 21.5 million Twitter followers, whereas his challenger has fewer than two million,\" he says. \"In addition, he (or his campaign team) is more active, having so far delivered over 400 tweets in this campaign to a mere 16 from the Romney camp. Obama scores more highly on YouTube too, with 21 campaign videos to Romney's 10.\"</p> <p>Social media is normally a two-way channel, but in this election it seems not to be so. \"What's noticeable about both candidates is the use of social media almost exclusively as a broadcast channel,\" says Stevens. \"Neither has very much engagement with their followers and Facebook friends, and retweets and response to messages are as rare as a friendly word between them. It would have made good sense to create at least some opportunities for engagement by responding to some messages, giving material for those personal stories in speeches that politicians covet.\"</p> <p>Mary Askew, <a href=\"http://maryaskewmedia.co.uk\">media commentator</a> and lecturer and a former political editor for the BBC, suggests this is the first American election in which social media has played such a prominent part in spite of Obama's use of Twitter in the previous one, and suggests this will help engage younger voters. She sees significance in the character of the communications: \"The campaigns teams have been using social media for much more than pictures from campaign trial or pleas for donations and volunteers \u2014 they have been using them to paint a picture of the candidates' home lives, trying to depict family men with a sense of humour and a life outside of politics,\" she says. \"We've learnt about the White House veg plot from Michelle Obama's Pinterest site, and seen pictures of the Mitt Romney having takeaway pizza with some of his grandchildren on Ann Romney's site.\"</p> <p>It's not quite Twitter and 'what I had for breakfast' but it's not far. \"From Spotify we've learnt about the candidates' favourite music, and with Twitter we're able to know exactly where the candidates are, and what they are doing,\" comments Askew. \"The New York Times even reported that Mitt Romney's bodyguard posted a picture of the candidate's family playing Jenga before a debate.\"</p> <p>The mainstream media remains divided. In the US the laws regulating the UK, which state that a television broadcaster may not be politically biased, don't apply. This opens the door to the obvious 'usual candidates' declaring their hands; there was never a possibility of Fox News supporting anyone but a right winger, for example. \"Both camps have claimed media bias against their guy,\" says Stevens. \"As usual, that means that the coverage is fairly balanced. Naturally, some media outlets such as Fox News make their preference clear. They don't sway voters at all, simply reinforcing entrenched views about either Romney or the lack of balance of Fox News, depending where your loyalties are. Overall, both candidates are media-savvy, but neither is doing enough to pull ahead of the other.\"</p> <p>Indeed there is some debate about just how important this media stuff is to the candidates anyway. Askew isn't sure just yet: \"More people must know more about the presidential campaigns than ever before, but what I'm fascinated by is what, if any, impact all this effort will have at the ballot box,\" she says. \"If you can predict an election by how many people like your Facebook page or follow you on Twitter then Obama is a shoe-in \u2014 more than 31 million people follow him on Facebook. But this is an American election first, nobody knows the influence of social media yet. What is certain is that nobody is taking any chances.\"</p> <p>In terms of what actually matters to people when they hear it, Romney's gaffes have undoubtedly helped Obama. His implied mistrust of the UK's handling of the Olympics has been overstated; the American public has no particular reason to worry about what he may or may not have said about the prospects of a remote country on another continent running the Games. He was particularly memorable in the televised debates insisting that Obama had taken two weeks to describe the Libyan attack on Benghazi as an 'act of terror'; in spite of the correction (the President had used that phrase the morning after) he repeated the allegation.</p> <p>Other than that moment TV played a less significant part than unofficial sources. Romney's famous quote about 47% of Americans paying no tax and being part of a dependency culture leaked online rather than being an 'official version'. The debates themselves were pretty tame. \"Barack Obama was asleep though the first debate and probably edged the other two, without landing a knockout blow,\" suggests Stevens. \"These days, candidates are so well prepped for head-to-head debates that a big win is unlikely, which makes the first debate look even more extraordinary, and one can only assume that the Obama camp underestimated their opponent.</p> <p>\"Neither candidate delivered a killer soundbite, which suggests either a lack of imagination from their teams, or an awareness that TV debates don't sway many undecided voters. I think that was a mistake, since campaigns can turn on a pithy, memorable phrase.\"</p> <p>In some ways that's what's been missing from this election campaign. In the 1990s Bill Clinton became President on the strength of the word \"Change\"; during the 1980s Ronald Reagan became President at least partly through taking advantage of his considerable charisma in front of the camera.</p> <p>It's possible that the current election is going to be the first in many years in which neither candidate has really grasped what Harold Wilson understood some 50 years ago: the importance of television and, in the early part of this century, the wider media.</p>",
  "<p>It's one thing to roll out of bed on election day and head straight for the polling station after dropping the kids at school without a thought to what you've got on. It's another when you vote in Janesville, Paul Ryan's hometown, and there are enough television cameras trained on the line as a red carpet runway.</p> <p>\"All of a sudden there was a bunch of cameras set up,\" said Melissa Crider, mother of five, who turned up to vote with her equally flummoxed friend Amy Tomlin. \"I thought to myself: 'I didn't sign up for his. Maybe I should just go back in line and wait'.\"</p> <p>\"If I'd know he was going to be here I definitely would not have come dressed in the clothes I dropped the kids off to school in,\" said Tomlin.</p> <p>There was already a sizeable line in front of the room set aside for voting at the Janesville public library when Paul Ryan turned up to cast his vote a little before 9am: Crider and Tomlin, a nun who later exited the library with a DVD of the Wizard of Oz tucked under arm and two women arguing loudly and angrily about the various merits of contestants on last night's edition of The Voice.</p> <p>Ryan, who is running for re-election to his seat in Congress as well as for vice-president, went straight to the front of the line \u2013 not that Crider held it against him. \"To be honest, he seemed a little embarrassed by it,\" she said. \"I think he was blushing,\" Tomlin said.</p> <p>The near-encounter might have been even more awkward if Ryan knew that Crider, who lives around the corner, didn't vote for him or Mitt Romney.</p> <p>Crider, a stay-at-home mother of five, says she was put off by the Republicans' positions on health care and women's issues.</p> <p>Ryan's district trends Democratic in presidential elections, especially urban areas like Janesville, but he has always carried his home town since he was first elected to Congress in 1998.</p> <p>It seemed this morning though that slightly more people were voting Democratic rather than Republican.</p> <p>A few who did vote Republican said they knew Ryan personally or had been helped by his congressional office.</p> <p>Laurence Fry, a retired manager, said he was grateful that Ryan's office helped arrange a visit to the Capitol when he and his wife visited Washington some years ago.</p> <p>Carolyn Klukas, who works in customer relations at a dentist's office, switched from Obama in 2008 to Romney this time but she said Ryan had nothing to do with it.</p> <p>\"The last four years have been pretty stagnant, she said. \"I think Obama's a nice guy but he is not doing a good job as president.\" She can't point to a specific reason for her disappointment, just a sense that Obama was not doing enough. \"I just think he has been too laid back, not strong enough,\" she said.</p> <p>Ryan is only spending a few hours in Wisconsin before a bout of last-minute campaigning. He told reporters he was really excited to spent Monday night in his home time, and he was confident about the elections. \"I feel good,\" he said. \"We're going to win.\"</p> <p>In Janesville at least, that's pretty much guaranteed. \"You could definitely tell that there were some people in line who had a very favourable impression of him and were happy to see him, and there were other people who let's just say were not going to be voting for him,\" said Thomas McDonald, who has served on Janesville city council in the past. But he said that some independent voters would be swayed to vote Republican, specifically because Ryan was on the ticket.</p> <p><em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/06/election-day-obama-romney-live\">Follow election day developments on our live blog</a></em></p>",
  "<p>\"Where's the real help? Where's the government?\"</p> <p>I was asked that question by Kenyatta Hutchinson, a young man whose family \u2013 wife and children, including an infant \u2013 has been displaced by Hurricane Sandy in the Rockaways, a narrow strip of land in southern Queens, New York. His entire apartment was flooded, and though he was happy to see the volunteers dotting the neighborhood, distributing food, blankets and diapers, he also felt angry and abandoned. This is a sentiment I've heard echoed many times over the last few days.</p> <p>President Obama's approval rating, heading into Tuesday's election, <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/johncassidy/2012/11/obama-gets-hurricane-sandy-bounce.html\">has risen</a> based on his handling of the storm, with some 67% of registered voters approving of his response. It's not clear exactly what those people are basing that approval on, other than that the aftermath of Sandy is not the obvious travesty that Hurricane Katrina was. The devastation of New Orleans in 2005 was perhaps the biggest turning-point in George W Bush's presidency: the moment when average Americans realized there was nothing \"compassionate\" about this conservative, and that cutting back federal programs (or <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2012/10/fema-case-study-difference-between-democrats-and-republicans\">appointing the former head of the Arabian Horse Association to run Fema</a>) had resulted in a very real cost of human suffering.</p> <p>Compared to this, of course, Obama's response looks serious, presidential. But on the ground, people are suffering still.</p> <p>The successes of Occupy Wall Street's mutual aid-based disaster relief have by now <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/blog/171020/occupy-sandy-efforts-highlight-need-solidarity-not-charity\">been well-documented</a> (I wrote about them for <a href=\"http://jacobinmag.com/2012/11/power-to-the-people/\">Jacobin Magazine</a>), and community groups like the one I traveled the Rockaways with Monday, <a href=\"http://www.youcaring.com/fundraiser_details?fundraiser_id=13028&amp;url=nycommuni\">New York Communities for Change</a>, have ably turned their community-organizing chops to assessing the needs of the most-affected communities \u2013 which, no surprise, are largely communities of color.</p> <p>But more, much more, is still needed. In public housing towers in the Rockaways \u2013 as <a href=\"http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2012/11/devastation_and.php\">Nick Pinto</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.alternet.org/jesus-come-help-us-what-its-no-power-no-running-water-and-little-food-post-sandy\">John and Molly Knefel</a> reported \u2013 residents are trapped in top-floor apartments without working elevators. The response from the Red Cross and National Guard has been to arrive, deposit goods and leave the residents, including elderly and disabled, to get heavy packages up many flights of stairs. In Arverne, where I was, residents told me about packages being dumped off the backs of trucks into the middle of the street.</p> <p>Staten Island, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nygovcuomo/status/265519199500242944\">Governor Cuomo's office tweeted</a>, will have medical vans out Tuesday \u2013 days after the Red Hook Initiative and Occupy Sandy found MDs to volunteer at their hub, and after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/05/staten-island-community-recovery-sandy\">motorcycle clubs found ways to feed their neighbors</a>. And billionaire Mayor Michael Bloomberg, days after being pushed into canceling the New York Marathon, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIG6knGhrIs&amp;feature=youtu.be\">was berated publicly by Rockaways residents</a> for his seemingly insensitive response to their needs. All this and the fact that gas lines have made it more difficult for locals with vehicles to join in giving aid.</p> <p>In the wake of Katrina, it was obvious that the federal response was inadequate, but here in New York City, the reality is a little more complicated. Yes, Fema and the National Guard are here and have distribution sites set up, but for the people stuck in public housing, without cellphone service or radios, how do they get to the aid? Some areas have been helped quickly, while others are struggling. And as in New Orleans, this often breaks down along lines of race and class. Just as in New Orleans, rumors of looting and violence lead all too often to a heavier <em>police</em> presence in traumatized neighborhoods than <em>aid worker</em> presence.</p> <p>Tuesday is presidential election day, and Barack Obama is asking for the votes of those who believe the federal government can and should help people in need, while his opponent, Mitt Romney, called for <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/31/paul-krugman-mitt-romney-fema_n_2050113.html\">dismantling Fema entirely</a> \u2013 or privatizing it. Criticisms of the government response to Sandy, including my own, have been met with fears of feeding into the same rightwing argument that says the government can't do anything right, and disaster relief is best left to the private sector. In fact, the MTA, a state agency, has gotten subways up and running remarkably quickly, while the private utilities are struggling to turn power back on.</p> <p>Mayor Bloomberg, who never met a <a href=\"http://www.alternet.org/hot-news-views/billionaire-mayor-bloomberg-sues-keep-new-yorkers-wages-low\">massive tax subsidy for business</a> he didn't like, and <a href=\"http://voices.yahoo.com/austerity-theme-yorks-2012-budget-8741033.html?cat=9\">austerity-happy Governor Cuomo</a>, will certainly echo some of this line in the coming months, as the expense of getting the five boroughs and Long Island moving again will almost certainly be an excuse for more budget cuts elsewhere. (And the <a href=\"http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2012/11/shock-doctrine-american-style-hurricane-sandy-devastation-used-to-push-for-sale-of-public-infrastructure-to-investors.html\">disaster capitalists are already circling</a> like vultures, waiting for the rebuilding contracts.) And President Obama's budget already calls for <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/10/30/obama-cuts-fema-funding-by-3-percent-romney-ryan-cuts-it-by-40-percent-or-more-or-less/\">cutting some 3% from Fema</a>.</p> <p>With some <a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/evacuee_stats_don_abode_well_AGL1HCEeTo9Y8OaI2D6VsK?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local\">30,000 to 40,000 people anticipated to be homeless</a> because of the storm \u2013 sleeping in cars or shelters as they drag sodden furniture and clothing out of flooded apartments \u2013 this is a crisis likely to last for months. That will require a massive rebuilding effort beyond the scope of even the most amazing activist groups.</p> <p>This is why we need a federal government response \u2013 and, in fact, why Fema was founded in the first place \u2013 because even individual states cannot care for everyone when hundreds of thousands are hit at once. In the weeks and months to come, as Republicans (Democrats and Independents, too) play politics with disaster relief \u2013 congressional Republicans <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/30/opinion/a-big-storm-requires-big-government.html\">have forced 43% cuts in Fema's grants</a> over the last two years \u2013 it will be important to remember the failures, as well as the improvements, after Sandy.</p> <p>Most of all, it will be important to push for more, to hold politicians accountable for their promises, and to remember that those failures are not inherent in government agencies: they're the result of clear political choices, both in the halls of Congress and the statehouse, and on the ground, where people live.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Resolution</strong>, the company set up to buy underperforming life insurers, has fallen 10% so far this year on worries about its structure, its outlook and its strategy.</p> <p>In comparison the insurance sector is up by nearly 30% over the same period, but analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch believe it could be time to buy Resolution's shares.</p> <p>In August the company called a halt to takeovers in favour of boosting returns to shareholders from its existing businesses, and raised its dividend by 5%. That could just be the start, said Merrill, which moved its recommendation from neutral to buy and raised its target price from 234p to 264:</p> <blockquote> We now have greater confidence in the company's ability to meet our dividend forecasts. And this is the most obvious reason to own the shares, in our view. We think the \u00a3300m or so annual dividend cost is comfortably (1.2-1.3 times) covered by free cash flow, especially taking into account the likely \u00a360m annual cash saving we expect from debt restructuring. Moreover, Resolution's balance sheet is defensively invested and is not overly leveraged (17% gearing). And the company's capital position looks adequate with more than \u00a33bn economic capital surplus. All of the above suggest limited risk to the dividend outlook, which is far from being priced into the shares, in our opinion. </blockquote> <p>That backing helped lift Resolution 15.4p higher to 236.6p, making it the biggest riser in the leading index.</p> <p>Still with insurers, <strong>Legal and General</strong> was lifted 3.9p to 144.2p by vague talk of a possible bid. Traders suggested Germany's Allianz as one potential predator, with a price of around 250p a share mentioned.</p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 45.84 points better at 5884.90 ahead of the US elections and a Greek vote on its budget and austerity package, due on Wednesday and Sunday.

It saw strong growth in emerging markets and hopes to win further UK contracts despite the Olympics problems.</p> <p><strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> rose 10.8p to 398.7p after its profits came in better than forecast, down 3% in the first half following a recovery in the second quarter.</p> <p>Chip designers <strong>Arm</strong> and <strong>Imagination Technologies</strong> were lifted by news they were carving up technology group MIPS Technologies.</p> <p>Arm, which added 14.5p to 709.5p, is part of a consortium buying the rights to MIPS' portfolio of 580 patents, contributing $167.5m to the total $350m purchase price, partly to reduce any future litigation risk.</p> <p>Separately Imagination, up 9.3p to 474.3p, is buying MIPS' operating assets, effectively its 160 engineers as well as 82 patents, for $60m. The move is designed to help Imagination become a stronger competitor for Arm.</p> <p><strong>InterContinental Hotels </strong>gained 21p to \u00a315.45 after better than expected third quarter profits of $167m, up 9%. Talks to sell its Barclay hotel in New York continue but it is also seeking new potential buyers of the property.</p> <p>Heading in the other direction was <strong>Babcock International</strong>, down 34.5p at 954.5p on profit taking after a positive update. Half year profits rose 13%, with the company benefiting from austerity as governments outsourced business to cut costs.</p> <p><strong>Standard Chartered</strong> fell 14.5p to 1468.5p as Credit Suisse cut its recommendation from neutral to underperform.</p> <p><strong>Associated British Foods</strong> dipped 1p to \u00a313.65 as it sounded a note of caution on the outlook for its sugar business, despite reporting a 17% rise in full year profits to \u00a3974m, boosted by another strong performance from its Primark discount fashion chain.</p> <p><strong>Invensys</strong> closed 4.5p higher at 238.9p as analysts at Nomura said the company was likely to boost its dividend payout and could even consider a cash return to investors. The bank began coverage of the rail equipment and controls group with a buy rating and a target price of 330p, both on the outlook for its business and the prospect of it becoming cash rich.</p> <p>But <strong>Premier Oil</strong> fell 7.5p to 352.6p after the Spaniards East well in the North Sea- where it owns 28% - was plugged and abandoned as a dry hole. Other companies with stakes in the well include <strong>Parkmead</strong>, down 1.13p to 14.5p, <strong>Serica Energy</strong>, 1.25p lower at 28.625p, and <strong>Faroe Petroleum</strong>, which fell 1.25p to 146.5p.</p> <p>Finally <strong>Armscote Investment Company</strong>, a business quoted on ISDX (the former Plus market), was steady at 1.25p as it announced the acquisition of Venn Life Sciences, the raising of \u00a32.5m and a plan to move the resulting business to Aim on 26 November.</p> <p>Separately, Armscote directors Adam Reynolds and Paul Foulger are part of a consortium paying \u00a34m to Autoclenz, the car valeting company, for its trading business.</p>",

Imagine what Jon Stewart could have done about the issue of Scottish independence or Saturday Night Live could have done about the \"cash for access\" scandal or what Trey Parker and Matt Stone could have done with the Jimmy Savile story.\" </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/19193358\" title=\"\">JeremyinOz heartily agrees:</a></p> <blockquote> \"When people compare British comedy favourably with American comedy (something that is getting harder and harder to do) they forget about the cartoon: South Park; the Family Guy stable and Matt Groening's work, which are consistently better and more biting than anything on British TV. When British writers try to be as pointed as South Park, say, they tend to come across as whiny or bitter or think that shouting Tory loudly is funny.\" </blockquote> <p>Speaking of whiny, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/oct/30/sarah-millican\" title=\"\">Sarah Millican's responses to the laser-like questioning of Guardian interviewer Simon Hattenstone</a> drew some criticism \u2013 and defence \u2013 from our readers. Then came <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/19194068\" title=\"\">jingjangjong, placing Millican firmly in the context of a grim view of UK comedy</a>.</p> <blockquote> \"She is no better or no worse than a raft of about 20 or so well-remunerated comics who seem to slip effortlessly from primetime BBC One to stadium tour to mega-selling DVD. They are all beige, boring and safe. It is like the past 30 years of alternative comedy never happened. <br> \"Actually things are probably worse now [than at the time of] the supposed wasteland of pre-alternative comedy in the 70s. At least Bernard Manning and his ilk doing jokes about \"them Pakis up our street\" was balanced out by Les Dawson and Dave Allen (on primetime ITV, no less!) doing stuff that made you wonder at the beauty of the English language or think about important stuff like politics and religion. What do we have now in the way of standup on TV that makes you think? Stewart Lee buried on late-night BBC2 \u2026\" </blockquote> <p>Is anyone prepared to leap to the defence of UK comedy?</p>",
  "<p>Residents of areas of New York and New Jersey that were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/30/sandy-storm-power-outages-restoration\">left without power when Hurricane Sandy struck last week</a> were on Monday being bused to non-damaged polling stations, in order to vote.</p> <p>Executive orders have been signed in both states to allow voters to cast their ballot at any booth, in an attempt to accommodate people who were forced out of their homes by the superstorm.</p> <p>Ernie Landante, a spokesman for the New Jersey Division of Elections, said: \"We are doing everything we can in this extraordinary situation not to disenfranchise voters displaced by Sandy. Their voices and their votes will be heard no differently than anyone else's.\"</p> <p>Officials in both states must also provide shelter for all those who are still without power, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/05/new-yorkers-storm-wait-shelter\">ahead of a storm which could hit the area as early as Wednesday</a>. The expected nor'easter could bring winds of up to 60mph and more flooding to areas which were hit badly by Sandy.</p> <p>In New York, up to 40,000 people are expected to need accommodation in the coming days. In cut-off areas of Staten Island and the Rockaways \u2013 a coastal region in the borough of Queens \u2013 some homeowners have endured an eighth night without power. On Monday, temperatures dropped to near freezing for a second consecutive night.</p> <p>New York's mayor, Michael Bloomberg, said on Monday that the city had adequate shelters for those who needed them. \"Every New Yorker who needs a warm place to live and a roof over his or her head is going to have one,\" he said, before adding that the incoming storm would make the work of emergency teams \"more difficult and more urgent\". Bloomberg said that housing everyone who needed help would pose a \"big challenge\".</p> <p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) said it had spent more than $200m on emergency housing assistance and had found places for 34,000 displaced people in hotels and temporary homes in New York and New Jersey. No long-term plan for accommodating all those hit by Sandy has been made.</p> <p>It is thought that more than a million homes and businesses are without power, as a result of downed lines and broken cables. Sandy has been blamed for more than 100 deaths in the US, adding to scores of deaths in the Caribbean. It is feared that with more bad weather on the way, hypothermia could claim move victims, especially among the elderly and infirm. Door-to-door searches are underway in New York, in an attempt to encourage those still suffering from loss of power to find alternative shelters.</p> <p>For some on Tuesday, voting was not an immediate concern. One Staten Island resident, Paul Hoppe, said he probably would not vote. He said his home, a block from the beach, was uninhabitable, his family had been displaced and their possessions ruined. \"We've got too many concerns that go beyond the national scene,\" Hoppe said.</p> <p>But for others, finding a polling booth was part of the transition back to normality. New York City authorities planned to run shuttle buses every 15 minutes to bring voters to the polls. Sixty of the city's 1,350 polling sites were unusable. Bloomberg said city residents should check the Board of Elections website, in order to find out about polling changes. \"Vote. It is our most precious right,\" he said.</p> <p>In the badly-hit coastal region of Ocean County, New Jersey, officials hired a converted camper van to bring mail-in ballots to shelters in Toms River, Pemberton and Burlington Township. \"It's great. This is one less thing I have to think about,\" said Josephine DeFeis from Seaside Heights, who voted on Monday.</p> <p>In New York and New Jersey, election officials were guardedly optimistic that power would be restored and that most polling places would be open in all but the worst-hit areas.</p> <p>New York governor Andrew Cuomo signed an executive order Monday allowing residents to cast a so-called affidavit or provisional ballot at any polling place in the state. Such votes will be counted after officials confirm the voter's eligibility.</p> <p>Cuomo said: \"Compared to what we have had to deal with in the past week, this will be a walk in the park when it comes to voting.\"</p>",
  "<p>Today, as you may have heard, is Election Day in the US. Here are a few notes about that:</p> <p><strong>(1)</strong> Ponder how great it would be if one could vote for the imaginary/fantasy Obama which, alas, sadly exists only in the paranoid imagination of those who populate the fever-swamps of the right-wing: the Kenyan anti-colonialist on the angry warpath against American militarism and oligarchy, engineering Apology Tours for America's past sins and vengeance-based retribution for thieving Wall Street tycoons. <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/332579/crush-them-michael-walsh\">Here</a>, for instance, is the person who National Review's Michael Walsh genuinely seems to think is president:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"In retrospect, of course, William Jefferson Blythe III was Pericles of Athens compared to Barack Obama, who far more than Clinton has revealed the true face of contemporary American left-liberalism in all its coercive ugliness: a blizzard of executive orders; the deployment of the regulatory agencies that have (in the words of the Declaration of Independence) 'sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance'; and the naked Marxist appeals to race and class envy. The most anti-American of American presidents has run the most un-American of campaigns.</p> <p>\"And that, by rights, should be it. That it's not explains the alarm of conservatives whose view of patriotism is that they love their country as it is, not as they wish it might someday be. From Day One of the Obama administration, real conservatives understood the explicit threat of 'fundamental change', whose meaning can now be clearly discerned in Obama's \"revenge' remark; for the Left, 'revenge' is precisely what this election is all about. For them and their voting-bloc constituents, it's payback time: payback for slavery and segregation; payback for poverty; payback for foreign wars; payback for restrictive immigration laws. </p> <p>\"They've long used the goals of the civil-rights movement \u2014 which after all was directed precisely agains't Democrats \u2013 and the Vietnam-era 'anti-war' movement \u2014 which arose in opposition to the foreign policy of the Democrats \u2014 as wedges with which to crack the larger social structure and now, so close to realizing the ultimate expression of 'critical theory' \u2014 that everything about America stinks \u2014 they and their media allies are doing their best to swing one last election for Obama.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Why didn't someone tell me that Obama was seeking \"fundamental change\", applies \"critical theory\" to conclude that American does much evil in the world, and is all about getting \"payback for poverty [and] payback for foreign wars\"? If you see that person on the ballot, please let me know. I'd like to go canvass for him. Or, as Brad Reed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bwreed/status/265829480579358720\">put it</a>: \"Kenyan anti-colonial socialism looks a lot like American imperial neoliberalism these days . . . .\"</p> <p><strong>(2)</strong> I rarely do election prognosticating, but the Atlantic's Conor Friedersdorf today remembered that, six months ago, I did, and he <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/11/why-the-long-campaign-season-has-been-bad-for-america/264589/\">examines whether my predictions turned out to be accurate</a>.</p> <p><strong>(3)</strong> The Guardian's live-blog for the election is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/06/election-day-obama-romney-live\">here</a>; I'll likely contribute a couple of items to it throughout the night. The Guardian today also has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2012/nov/06/america-elect-graphic-novel\">an amazingly well-done graphic novel summarizing the election</a>.</p> <p><strong>(4)</strong> Beginning at 4:00 pm EST, I'll be on Al Jazeera English all night as part of their election coverage team. For those who don't get that network, you can <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/\">watch it live here</a>.</p> <p><strong>(5)</strong> Yesterday, Mother Jones' Adam Serwer <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/11/obama-romney-civil-liberties-no-choice\">documented that</a>, as his headline put it: \"What Would Romney Do to Civil Liberties? Eh, pretty much what Obama has done. Because when it comes to the war on terror, there's not much difference between the two candidates.\" Benjamin Wittes of Lawfare and Brookings <a href=\"http://www.lawfareblog.com/2012/11/thoughts-on-election-day-towards-consensus-and-institutional-settlement/\">makes a similar point today</a>, noting that \"the campaign has been remarkably free of serious disagreements over the basic authorities to prosecute the conflict with overseas terrorist enemies,\" due to the \"remarkable degree of consensus [that] has emerged between the parties as to the basic rules that should govern the American side of the conflict\".</p> <p>Along those lines, Ramesh Ponnuru of the conservative National Review became one of the few mainstream commenters this election to <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-05/why-drones-stayed-out-of-sight-in-the-2012-campaign.html\">write a critical analysis of the US of drones</a>, pointing out the irony that Obama, a fan of the Showtime program \"Homeland,\" \"has heard more discussion of the downside of drone strikes in a television drama than he has in the presidential race.\" </p> <p>(As for \"Homeland\", Columbia Professor Joseph Massad, in Al Jazeera, has a <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2012/10/2012102591525809725.html\">scathing and fascinating attack on the show's politics</a>; it's well worth reading, though I actually disagree with parts of it (though not all) quite vigorously: that show is, in some ways, surprisingly nuanced, even somewhat subversive, as it features a US Marine as a main character who becomes an anti-US \"terrorist\" when the US government orders a drone strike that it knows will kill close to 100 children, kills a young Palestinian boy to whom he had grown close, and then systematically covers up the childrens' death, depicting it all as \"terrorist propaganda\". The show also at times equates top US officials and Muslim terrorists for their propensity to kill civilians in a way that is rarely seen in political discourse, let alone mainstream entertainment).</p> <p><strong>(6)</strong> Relating to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/05/muslim-no-fly-qatar\">yesterday's column about Saddiq Long</a>, the US Muslim placed on a no-fly list with no due process or transparency, Mother Jones' Kevin Drum <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2012/11/kafkaesque-world-no-fly-list\">explains the very clear and simple point</a> raised by that episode, one which remarkably seemed to elude several commenters yesterday eager to defend the US government's actions.</p>",
  "<p>So I don't know if you've heard but apparently there has been some kind of&#xa0;election going on somewhere in the world. People voting on a prime minister or a prince or a president or something like that? I work in a newspaper office, so I'm pretty in-the-know about world events.</p> <p>Now, because we still live in the antiquated year of 2012, I am writing this column a whole 24 hours before both the paper and the results come out (in the future, of course, such delays will be laughable and columns will be transmitted instantly from journalists' brains to retina of readers and typing on computers will seem as antiquated as calligraphy in illuminated manuscripts). So the backwards state of our current technology prevents me from sharing my election thoughts with you here today but, rest assured, they are very deep and intellectual. In any event, there is a&#xa0;high chance you are a bit sick of this election thing already. Heck, I'm sick of it and I'm American. Lord knows how the Brits will feel with all of their newspapers and news channels given over to 24-hour coverage of the thing.</p> <p>But despite the impression given by the media, there are plenty of other things you can talk about today. Important things! Pressing things! Things such as the following:</p> <h2><strong>Jimmy Savile, marriage counsellor</strong></h2> <p>When I moved to Britain from the US in 1990, I felt pretty much right at home straight away. However, I knew there were some things about Britain that I&#xa0;would never, ever understand. Last of the Summer Wine, for a start. Tommy Cooper. Les Dawson. Bros. And most of all, Jimmy Savile. The man was clearly creepy \u2013 or, to use the British term, \"eccentric\" \u2013 and yet that was part of his appeal. This was apparently the point of him and generally acknowledged. So even back in 1990 when the extent of his creepiness was not known, no one \u2013 <em>no one</em> \u2013 would go to this tracksuited 64-year-old who lived with his mum to ask for marital guidance. No one, that is, except for Prince Charles.</p> <p>According to the memorably named Dickie Arbiter, former press secretary to the Queen, in 1990 <a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/newsuknewssavileinquiry/article1159135.ece\" title=\"\">Prince Charles asked Savile</a> to please help him fix his marriage. \"It didn't work,\" Arbiter clarified.</p> <p>Now, it has long been obvious that Prince Charles has the mental age of about 14 because only a particularly stupid 14-year-old boy would tell a woman that he would like to be reincarnated as her tampon, as most adult men are aware of&#xa0;what tampons actually do and only vampires could get turned on by that. But, in using Savile as a marriage counsellor, Charlie truly excelled himself and reminded the world at large that his ignorance about women does not end at a physical level (Diana, according to her former protection officer, Ken Wharfe, \"was not a great fan&#xa0;of Savile's\"). Did he look at his boo-hoo bwoken mawwiage and want Jim to Fix It? Did he think he would get an&#xa0;ickle-wickle badge? My God \u2013 and we're&#xa0;supposed to bow to this man?</p> <h2><strong>Did David Cameron compare Rebekah Brooks to&#xa0;a horse?</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2227459/Camerons-horseplay-texts-Rebekah-Brooks-Intimate-messages-PM-reveal-likes-fast-unpredicatable-ride.html\" title=\"\">Allegedly so</a>, yes. The fist gnawingly embarrassing texts between Cameron and Brooks, with the latest being Cameron referring to the \"fast and unpredictable ride\" Charlie Brooks's horse gave him, are bad enough. But it's the comment that Cameron allegedly said to his old Etonian chum when the latter started dating the then Rebekah Wade that is just straight out sphincter-shrinking.</p> <p>\"Better not mess this one up, Charlie,\" the Mail&#xa0;on Sunday claims Cameron said to C Brooks. \"It's the most important ride of your life.\" Because women are animals, you see, whom you ride. In&#xa0;bed. You see? You see?! Insert joke here about posh people preferring animals to women and children, stick head in the Cuisinart.</p> <h2><strong>How many films does Skyfall \"pay homage to\"?</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong><em>[SPOILER ALERT, although seeing as you've no doubt seen the films Skyfall rips off, it's probably already spoilt]</em></p> <p>Loads. Home Alone, definitely. The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises, arguably. The whole Harry Potter series. And maybe it's just me but that bit in Skyfall when [spoiler, spoiler etc etc] a certain key character dies at the end reminded me quite a lot of when Bambi's mother gets shot. Cried more over Bambi, obvs.</p> <h2><strong>That hideous article in the Sunday Times about&#xa0;Judaism</strong></h2> <p>This is possibly not a national talking point, but, damn it, it should be. According to <a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/style/fashion/People/article1157384.ece\" title=\"\">a certain article</a> in a Sunday Times&#xa0;supplement magazine last weekend, \"British Jewishness has suddenly become a hip cultural talking point.\" Oh thank you, Sunday Times, for the validation!</p> <p>\"Put it down to a search for exoticism,\" the magazine suggested. Ah yes \u2013 \"exoticism\". We Jews really are so very Other, what with spooky voodoo ways and our foreign accents. \"[Or] maybe it's the attraction of the monetary rewards connected with being Jewish, but today's celebrities are less shy about talking about their roots.\" You whatty the what? Hey, Mel Brooks, Woody Allen and Philip Roth \u2013 when was it that prominent Jews last hid their faith? 1945, perhaps? And as&#xa0;for \"the monetary rewards connected with being Jewish\", I cannot deny it, we Jews do&#xa0;hoard our shekels. We gaze upon them adoringly while we rub our hands with Shylockian glee.</p> <p>\"'There's not as much stigma attached to&#xa0;being Jewish as there used to be,'\" some talking head added, apparently just having woken up from a nap that began in 1937. Sadly, I couldn't read the rest of the article as&#xa0;my giant hooked nose blocked my view, but&#xa0;I think we all get the picture.</p>",
  "<h2>Pace yourself</h2> <p>Watching an election is like hosting a party: hours of nervous anticipation, then everything arrives at once. If you're reading this in the UK, you may sense the wind direction by 1.30am, but for any chance of seeing the result you're staying up past 3am. In a close race like this, it will probably be longer. Shape up, in short, or ship out.</p> <h2>Drink strategically</h2> <p>Do you have an entire night's sedentary boozing in you? If not, do like Mitt Romney and abjure alcohol. Coffee and Red Bull have their uses, but hold back until at least 11pm, when Kentucky amazes nobody by staying Republican.</p> <h2>Eat in instalments</h2> <p>American food may be traditional this evening, but don't serve it in American portions or you'll still be in a digestive stupor when polls close in Alaska. Have a small dinner, then perhaps one hotdog each when you get confirmation of voter turnouts in Virginia (around midnight GMT). If you're still awake when Ohio declares, attack the doughnuts.</p> <h2>Cancel Wednesday</h2> <p>You can't let things like your career spoil a good night's television, but bear in mind that yours may not be the only husky voice that calls in sick tomorrow morning.

  "<p>At the polls Tuesday, some voters will matter more than others. And those <a href=\"http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g1HdKOeUIB5xMj3VoMXL3BN08ZKQ?docId=CNG.adb9ff56d5c1edfae8b9a4b7e819ccb1.131&amp;index=0\">voters are likely to be women</a>. </p> <p>It's a women's election, and a women's economy, for perhaps the first time in American political history. </p> <p>We see some acknowledgment of the political power of women in the way <a href=\"http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g1HdKOeUIB5xMj3VoMXL3BN08ZKQ?docId=CNG.adb9ff56d5c1edfae8b9a4b7e819ccb1.131&amp;index=0\">the campaigns have courted women</a>. But as to the economic power of women, the emphasis has been much lighter. President Obama cast healthcare, and abortion, as economic issues \u2013 which they are, partly. Ads for Mitt Romney included women worrying about student debt. </p> <p>But the real economic power of women \u2013 over the coming fight over tax breaks, over unemployment, over wages \u2013 has been largely ignored during the campaign season, and is likely to be ignored after the election as well, unless women do something about it. Even though women hold more economic power than ever, women are still not indicating that they are willing to make these economic issues into flashpoints, in the way that health issues have been. </p> <p>The jobs picture and the economy are usually secondary issues for female voters, trailing abortion by a large margin, according to a recent CNN poll. Abortion is the issue that women, at least in that poll, said they would consider the most important in the election \u2013 perhaps because it has been openly threatened more than the economic rights of women have.</p> <p>But the economic rights of women are threatened \u2013 every time they're not spoken about, every time they're ignored in favor of another debate about empty chairs or a fringe politician's definition of rape. When the news cycle and the campaign spin and the talking points don't address the economic future of women, outside of healthcare, it's like diminishing the growing influence of women as economic beings (and not only reproductive ones). </p> <p>We've heard how women are going to be a political force in this election. Women <a href=\"http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/00000.html\">make up over half of the population of the United States</a>, according to the most recent US census. <a href=\"http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/fast_facts/voters/turnout.php\">More women than men have voted in the past three presidential elections</a>. Women also make up 60% of undecided voters \u2013 the crucial \"swing vote\" that has President Obama and Governor Mitt Romney running themselves ragged to win.</p> <p>Even though undecided voters comprise only 4% of all voters, neither candidate has the luxury of sacrificing those crucial swing votes. This year, there is also a record number of women are running for high political office, with 18 women running for the Senate and 163 running for the House. But while women wield political power, they also wield the power to push for economic changes \u2013 power that is, currently, largely unclaimed. </p> <p>University of Michigan economist Betsey Stevenson co-wrote a <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-22/what-mitt-romney-doesn-t-know-about-families.html\">recent political piece on how families work \u2013 which, usually, depends on how women work</a>. As she was doing her research, \"the thing that struck me is this idea that women are secondary workers, on the sidelines in the economy thinking about joining the labor force.\" That depiction is not accurate, Stevenson said: \"They are very much in it.\"</p> <p>In fact, there is no question that women are an economic force now more than in any previous election. More than half of all women are the breadwinners in their households, and the <a href=\"http://blog.al.com/huntsville-times-business/2012/09/number_of_women-owned_business.html\">number of women-owned businesses has grown nearly 66% since 1997</a>.</p> <p>And yet, the economic power of women remains largely unacknowledged. Pay equity has been an all-but-absent issue during the campaigns, and certainly one without any concrete policy proposals on either side. Several of the tax breaks that may be impacted by the fiscal cliff affect women disproportionately, like the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/10/28/how-the-fiscal-cliff-would-affect-the-poorest-americans/\">earned-income tax credit or the child tax credit</a> that matter for single mothers.</p> <p>Women have largely gained, not lost, jobs since 2009, <a href=\"http://www.iwpr.org/publications/pubs/job-growth-improves-in-october-for-both-women-and-men-women-gain-53-percent-of-jobs-added-women-now-have-net-job-growth-since-february-2009\">according to the Institute for Women's Policy Research</a>. Still, there is a gap of 1.8m jobs between men and women. </p> <p>It's a given that not all women have the same economic interests, in the same way that not all women have the same religion or the same view on the US supreme court. In fact, the voting gap between married and unmarried women is even greater than the gap between men and women, said Emily Martin, vice-president and general counsel for the National Women's Law Center. Single women have a very different picture of their financial power and interests than married women do.</p> <p>As Betsey Stevenson pointed out, married women are in households where their interests interwine with those of their husbands. Perhaps for that reason, married women have been, in polls, similar to men: they lean towards Romney. <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2012/11/02/on-election-day-single-women-could-sway-the-vote\">Single women lean towards Obama</a>.</p> <p>But neither type of woman seems, so far, to lean toward holding the feet of the president and Congress to the fire over improving wages and equality in the workplace. It may not be long before women start thinking that way, at least according to one economist. Eileen Appelbaum, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, says:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"If you're not the main breadwinner in your family, then perhaps other issues, those social issues, may loom larger.</p> <p>\"But this has changed radically, because of the rising unemployment among women, and because so many women are the breadwinner or the co-breadwinner in so many American households now.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>So, when it comes to the idea that women don't vote according to the economy or jobs or government deficits, \"that may be changing.\"</p>",
  "<p>It was raining in some parts of the sunshine state as voters went to the polls this morning. And there are far more significant weather-related problems on election day in the states of New York and New Jersey. What effect does weather have on turnout?</p> <p>Bad weather actually <a href=\"http://hoot.metr.ou.edu/archive/story&amp;docId=21\">does drive down</a> voter participation. For every inch above normal rainfall, overall turnout drops by a little less than 1%, but Democratic turnout drops by 2.5%. Every inch above average snowfall decreases turnout by 0.5%. Since the water equivalent of 10 inches of snow usually equals an inch of rain, it's more likely snow will effect an election.</p> <p>Still, the weather would have to be quite bad and the election quite close for there to be much of an interaction between an election outcome and weather.</p> <p>Will the weather be bad enough anywhere for weather to make that big of an impact? Mostly, it won't considering many people have already voted and the weather will be pretty good for most.</p> <p>In six of the 10 swing states discussed here, including Ohio, the weather will be clear. </p> <p>In Iowa and North Carolina, there will be showers in certain parts of the state. Most of that rain will be very light. Given the polling position of the candidates, the rain will likely not have an impact. </p> <p>Wisconsin could have some rain in major Democratic areas and snow in the swing area around Green Bay. If the race were tighter in the badger state, I'd wonder more about whether the weather could flip the race. </p> <p>Florida is the one state where rain could change have more an impact. There will be showers in the northern half of the state including the key I-4 corridor. Even so, the race would have to be about a point to a point and a half tighter than polling average for the weather to have an effect. </p> <p>You can take a more in-depth look below at the forecast for different parts of 10 swing states from north to south and east to west.</p> <h2>New Hampshire</h2> <p><strong>Real Clear Politics average</strong>: Obama +2<br><strong>Forecast for Manchester, NH (center)</strong>: High in the low to mid 40s and sunny</p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Weather will not decrease turnout.</p> <h2>Pennsylvania</h2> <p><strong>Real Clear Politics average</strong>: Obama +3.8<br><strong>Forecast for Philadelphia (southeast)</strong>: High near 50 and sunny<br><strong>Forecast for Pittsburgh (southwest)</strong>: High in the upper 40s <strong>and sunny<br>Forecast for State College (center)</strong>: High in the mid 40s and sunny<br><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Weather will not decrease turnout.</p> <h2>Virginia</h2> <p><strong>Real Clear Politics average</strong>: Obama +0.3<br><strong>Forecast for Arlington (north</strong>): High near 50 and sunny<br><strong>Forecast for Richmond (southeast)</strong>: High in the lower 50s and a mix of clouds and sun<br><strong>Forecast for Roanoke (southwest)</strong>: High near 50 and a mix of clouds and sun</p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Weather will not decrease turnout.</p> <h2>North Carolina</h2> <p><strong>Real Clear Politics average</strong>: Romney +3.0<br><strong>Forecast for Charlotte (southwest)</strong>: High near 50 and a slight chance of early showers<br><strong>Forecast for Greenville (east)</strong>: High in the lower 50s and a chance of showers<br><strong>Forecast for Raleigh (central-east)</strong>: High in the lower 50s and a slight chance of showers</p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Any rain will be light and Romney will likely win by a wide enough margin for it not to change the course of the state's electoral outcome. </p> <h2>Florida</h2> <p><strong>Real Clear Politics average</strong>: Romney +1.5<br><strong>Forecast for Jacksonville (northeast)</strong>: High in the upper 60s and showers<br><strong>Forecast for Miami (southeast)</strong>: High near 80 and a mix of <strong>clouds and Ssun<br>Forecast for Orlando (central-east)</strong>: High in the upper 70s and showers<br><strong>Forecast for Tallahassee (panhandle)</strong>: High in the mid 60s and a chance of showers<br><strong>Forecast for Tampa (central-west)</strong>: High in the mid 70s and showers</p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: It's a tight race and it could be raining in Republican north and swing areas of the I-4 corridor from Orlando to Tampa. Chances are, however, the rain won't be too heavy. Unless the race is decided by less than 0.5 points, weather won't impact the final result.</p> <h2>Ohio</h2> <p><strong>Real Clear Politics average</strong>: Obama +2.9<br><strong>Forecast for Athens (southeast)</strong>: High near 50 and sunny<br><strong>Forecast for Cincinnati (southwest)</strong>: High in the lower 50s and sunny<br><strong>Forecast for Cleveland (northeast)</strong>: High in the mid 50s <strong>with a mix of sun and clouds<br>Forecast for Columbus (central)</strong>: High near 50 and sunny<br><strong>Forecast for Toledo (northwest)</strong>: High in the upper 40s and sunny</p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Weather will not decrease turnout.</p> <h2>Wisconsin</h2> <p><strong>Real Clear Politics average</strong>: Obama +4.2<br><strong>Forecast for Green Bay (northeast)</strong>: High in the lower 40s <strong>with a mix of snow and rain in the afternoon<br>Forecast for Hayward (northwest)</strong>: High in the lower 40s with early showers<br><strong>Forecast for La Crosse (central-west)</strong>: High in the upper 40s with early showers<br><strong>Forecast for Madison (central)</strong>: High in the mid 40s with a rain/snow mixture becoming all rain showers<br><strong>Forecast for Milwaukee (southeast)</strong>: High in the mid 40s with showers</p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The weather won't exactly be glorious in the Democratic strongholds of Madison and Milwaukee. Still, any precipitation looks to be well less than an inch. Given Obama's lead in the polls, weather should not sway this contest.</p> <h2>Iowa</h2> <p><strong>Real Clear Politics average</strong>: Obama +2.4<br><strong>Forecast for Davenport (east)</strong>: High in the upper 50s and showers<br><strong>Forecast for Des Moines (central)</strong>: High in the lower 50s and sunny<br><strong>Forecast for Sioux City (northwest)</strong>: High the mid 50s and sunny</p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The weather in the east will be slightly wet, but it will far less than an inch. Most of the state will be dry. Unless the result is within a few thousand votes, rain won't have changed the winner. </p> <h2>Colorado</h2> <p><strong>Real Clear Politics average</strong>: Obama +1.5<br><strong>Forecast for Denver (central-north)</strong>: High near 70 and sunny<br><strong>Forecast for Grand Junction (west)</strong>: High in the mid 60s and sunny<br><strong>Forecast for Pueblo (southeast)</strong>: High in the mid 70s and sunny</p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Weather will not decrease turnout.</p> <h2>Nevada</h2> <p><strong>Real Clear Politics average</strong>: Obama +2.8<br><strong>Forecast for Elko (northeast)</strong>: High in the lower 70s and sunny<br><strong>Forecast for Las Vegas (south)</strong>: High in the mid 80s and <strong>sunny<br>Forecast for Reno (northwest)</strong>: High in the mid 70s and sunny</p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Weather will not decrease turnout.</p>",
  "<p>It is somewhat simplistic to observe the chaos in many western economies and believe, as Seumas Milne optimistically states, the \"neoliberal capitalist model\" is crashing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/19/new-world-order\" title=\"\">(New World Order coming to an end, 26&#xa0;October)</a>. While it may be true that much of what the public believes was a stable financial system has crashed, international banking cartels and transnational corporations have hardly disintegrated.</p> <p>If anything, the transfer of public money into corporations deemed too big to fail has further demonstrated how successful the elites have been in protecting their power. Indeed, many of the world's central banks are still printing money and receiving interest and influence at the expense of the millions of unemployed in recession-hit nations.</p> <p>In addition, the use of the war on terror to further indebt countries is working well. This is particularly true for the big protagonists. The US and the UK have huge military budgets, so the cost of these multiple wars are profits to an assortment of private military contractors and arms manufacturers, many being subsidiaries to some of the world's largest corporations. Suffice it to say, sales are booming.</p> <p>Before we celebrate victory over the New World Order perhaps we should dig deeper and see where the money and power are really going.</p> <p><strong>Lisa Kattnick</strong><br>Mullumbimby, NSW, Australia</p> <p>\u2022 I am perplexed by Seumas Milne's optimistic piece. So the twin towers are attacked, the war on terror begins and taxpayers fund huge budget deficits to bolster the military-industrial complex. In summer 2008 Lehman Brothers is allowed to collapse, its assets swallowed up by other giant banks. Hedge funds make millions.</p> <p>Roll on to 2012, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney fight another excessively funded election. Much of their foreign policy agenda is indistinguishable while lobby groups ensure any changes to corporate regulation remain typically toothless.</p> <p>Europe continues to fall deeper into recession. With unemployment rising and civil unrest simmering unelected technocrats and economists take centre stage in decision-making. All this as central banks fight for their interest payments and the government assets that await privatisation.</p> <p>When the world faces such problems those behind the scenes consolidate wealth and shore up their dominant position; wars and economic restructuring are useful tools for this game. The elite and their New World Order are alive and kicking, working diligently towards greater profit and more control. I will not be celebrating the crumbling of the global order any time soon.</p> <p><strong>Mathew Kollar</strong><br>Nelson, British Columbia, Canada</p> <p><strong>American English thrives</strong></p> <p>\"The British are coming!

The Yanks are over here linguistically, and their turns of expression are already deeply embedded in English parlance. Why do we say \"in the doghouse\" when we keep our dogs in kennels? Why do we say \"married on a shoestring\" when we tie our shoes with laces, not with strings? Why do we say \"coming out of the closet\" when we keep things in cupboards?</p> <p>And then there are the rapid changes in pronunciation, when we tamely go over to the way Americans speak, rather than our own. Think of the \"arrilies\": \"primarily\" is a prime example. We used to say it with the stress on the first syllable, but now it's pry-<em>marry</em>-li, in the American way. The same goes for all the other arrilies, voluntarily, necessarily, temporarily etc. Nobody under the age of 60 pronounces these words in the good old-fashioned English way. Very harassing!</p> <p>But still, we must admit that they have contry-booted very much to our way of speaking, and distry-booted their terms of expression throughout the English-speaking world. Take these two sentences I heard from colleagues: \"He must have went.\" \"I used to could.\" Utter grammatical solecisms, one would say, but they were spoken by American teachers of English \u2013 showing they are quite willing to take liberties with grammatical rules for colourful effect.</p> <p>Who else would have come up with \"modem\" \"upload\" \"downsize\" and other such invaluable expressions?

Some direct encounters from Rosin's personal experience are glossed over quickly in support of ribald canards like, \"Bethenny was doing too much, but she was making it work and she had her freedom. Why would she want to give all that up?\" Has the editorial staff lost its sense of cringe?</p> <p>I haven't time to list the balance of similar sophistry in Rosin's work, but it should have been left for Cosmopolitan to publish.</p> <p><strong>Richard Milan</strong><br>Madrid, Spain</p> <p><strong>Gangtok is no paradise</strong></p> <p>As I was in Gangtok at the beginning of October I was taken by surprise to read the Letter from India: Gangtok holds tales of sahibs long since past <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/23/letter-from-india-gangtok-sikkim\" title=\"\">(26 October)</a>.</p> <p>Gangtok, with its more or less 30,000 inhabitants, is a town that in the last couple of years has been invaded by a relentless wave of cars \u2013 many natives wear a cloth over their nose and mouth to keep from breathing in exhaust fumes.

  "<p>Republicans currently control 29 out of 50 governorships and are looking to expand that advantage. They are likely to win in <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/governor/nc/north_carolina_governor_mccrory_vs_dalton-2103.html\">North Carolina</a> where former Charlotte Mayor Pat McCrory is headed for victory over Democratic Lieutenant Governor Walter Dalton. They also have a shot to pick up seats in three other gubernatorial races detailed in order of closing time below. </p> <h2>New Hampshire</h2> <p><strong>Polls close:</strong> 7pm ET for most of state; 8pm ET for a few bigger cities)</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> Governor John Lynch (Democrat) is retiring</p> <p><a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/\"><strong>Swing counties</strong></a>: Cheshire (slightly Democratic leaning) and Hillsborough (slightly Republican leaning), though all except Conn will be relatively close to statewide vote</p> <p><strong>Candidate county strengths:</strong> Democratic \u2013 Grafton and Merrimack. Republican \u2013 Conn and Rockingham</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/governor/2012_elections_governor_map.html\"><strong>Real Clear Politics average</strong></a>: Hassan (Democrat) +3.2pt</p> <p>The match-up here can be described as the non-offensive former Democratic state senate majority leader against the quite conservative Republican Ovide Lamontagne. Maggie Hassan hasn't raised the specter of creating a sales or income tax, while supporting mostly liberal positions on social issues, including abortion and gay marriage to which Lamontagne is opposed. Both support the second amendment, though they differ on specifics: Hassan wants \"common sense\" restrictions, where Lamontagne is for concealed handguns without a permit. They also have opposite views on requiring car passengers to wear seat belts: Hassan is for; Lamontagne against. </p> <p>Hassan seems to have opened a slight edge, but whichever party wins, the slightly Democratic-leaning presidential race in this state will likely take the governor's mansion, too. </p> <h2>Montana</h2> <p><strong>Polls close:</strong> 10pm ET</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> Governor Brian Schweitzer (Democrat) is term-limited </p> <p><strong>Swing counties:</strong> Yellowstone (slightly Republican-leaning in 2008, yet slightly Democratic-leaning in 2004)</p> <p><strong>Candidate county strengths:</strong> Democratic \u2013 Cascade, Lewis and Clark, Missoula, Silver Bow. Republican \u2013 Flathead and Ravalli </p> <p><strong>Real Clear Politics average:</strong> Hill (Republican) +1.7pt</p> <p>With the exception of the Indiana Senate race, there hasn't been a tight major race that has been more under-polled than this one. Republican Rick Hill and Democrat Steve Bullock are locked in a tight battle, in which you have both candidates supporting gun rights, some form of a tax rebate or cut, and reducing the state budget. They divide along the traditional Democratic and Republican lines on the social issues of abortion and gay rights (though Bullock is opposed to gay marriage). Outside money has flooded the race on the issue of oil, which is booming in the eastern part of the state. Bullock, generally, is for more liberal positions on energy, while Hill wants to \"drill, baby, drill\".</p> <p>Hill probably will be carried across the finish line by Republican Mitt Romney, yet Democrats have been on a roll in statewide races in Montana of late.</p> <h2>Washington State</h2> <p><strong>Polls close:</strong> 11pm ET</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> Governor Christine Gregoire (Democrat) is retiring</p> <p><strong>Swing counties:</strong> Kitsap (slightly Republican-leaning), Pierce (slightly Republican-leaning), Snohomish, Whatcom </p> <p><strong>Candidate county strengths:</strong> Democratic \u2013 King and Thurston. Republican \u2013 pretty much everywhere else that isn't Democratic or swing including Benton, Spokane, and Yakima</p> <p><strong>Real Clear Politics average:</strong> Inslee (Democrat) +1.0pt</p> <p>This race won't likely be decided until at least late this week, given that Washington uses mail-in ballots. Democrat Jay Inslee is what you'd expect from a Democrat running in a blue state: he's pro-choice, for gay marriage, for light rail, for eliminating a two-thirds majority in the state legislature to raise taxes, pro-marijuana legalization, and wants to link business tax credits to hiring workers. </p> <p>Republican attorney general Rob McKenna is socially moderate and fiscally conservative: pro-choice but against forcing insurance sponsored by the state to cover abortion, pro-gay rights including being against the Boy Scouts anti-gay policy yet against same-sex marriage, against light rail, against eliminating the two-thirds rule for raising taxes, for medical marijuana but against legalization for all, and big on tax credits for small business. </p> <p>McKenna's hopes may rest on his education positions, including support for merit pay and a ballot referendum for charter schools, which Inslee opposes. I'd have to think Obama can carry Inslee across the finish line, though it's certainly possible McKenna might break the Democrats' long-time hold on the governor's mansion.</p>",

Alternatively, will it offer us the chance to forget the nightmare of the US election and get on with the simple business of celebrating American genius free from the fear and tension of the past few weeks?</p> <p>I'm hopeful, based on <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/06/nov-5-late-poll-gains-for-obama-leave-romney-with-longer-odds/\" title=\"\">current polling</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/19248751\" title=\"\">the description of True Grit by its proposer, tenuousfives</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"If I only get to suggest one then it must be True Grit by Charles Portis. Its reputation seems to have dimmed in the wake of the two films based on its story, but I'm here to tell you it is well worth a read. Simple and quick and yet so rewarding. As Donna Tartt says in her great introduction \u2013 it's all too easy to say that we \"love a book\" based on one read. However, I've felt the thunderbolt and I am ready to love. I know it's always going to be in my life and the live's of my family to read again and again and to introduce to new generations young and old.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Inspiring stuff. Although, as we'll discover this month, True Grit is definitely a book that rewards more than one read. It's a classic case of art hiding the artifice. It seems incredibly simple \u2013 until you look closely at what's going on under the bonnet, as we shall do. There are also <a href=\"http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0065126/\" title=\"\">two</a> great <a href=\"http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt1403865/\" title=\"\">films</a> to talk about.

Which may go some way to explaining why right now he is doing his best to emphasise the country's silliness.</p> <p><strong>What's he done? </strong>He has <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/world/2010/dec/07/kazakhstan-president-scientists-research-ageing\">instructed Kazakh scientists to go in search of the elixir of life</a>, and, after two years and a few million quid of research, they have invented yoghurt.</p> <p><strong>Hold on. He instructed them to what?</strong> To investigate \"anti-ageing medicine, natural rejuvenation, immortality\".</p> <p><strong>How did this all start? </strong>Two years ago a member of the Kazakh parliament suggested Nazarbayev stay on as president until \"at least\" 2020. To which he responded: \"I'm willing to go on to 2020. Just find me the elixir.\"</p> <p><strong>As a joke, surely? </strong>Maybe at first. But he then asked Kazakh scientists to look into \"the study of the prolongation of life\" on three separate occasions that year, even telling them: \"People of my age are really hoping all of this will happen as soon as possible.\"</p> <p><strong>So they brought him a yoghurt? </strong>Well, they had&#xa0;to&#xa0;bring him something.

It will be able to improve the quality of life and prolong it.\"</p> <p><strong>And Nar is a yoghurt? </strong>Yep. It's also the Kazakh&#xa0;word for \"food\".

The draw was the first in Dixville Notch history, and local officials presented it as a portent of the day to come.</p> <p>The Obama campaign was likely to draw more comfort from New Hampshire's second result, in the slightly bigger Hart's Location, where the president got 23 votes to Romney's nine. But even before election day began, some 30 million Americans had already cast their ballots, a reflection of the steady rise of early voting in the US electoral system.</p> <p>Both teams claimed to be on course to win as they completed what should have been their final blitz of the swing states. Obama took in Wisconsin, where Bob Dylan performed for his supporters and predicted a Democratic landslide. The star-studded final White House campaign later made two stops in Ohio, where the president was joined on stage in Columbus by Bruce Springsteen and Jay-Z.</p> <p>He ended his 2012 campaign in near-freezing temperatures in the Iowa state capital, Des Moines, where he, Michelle Obama and Springsteen appeared before a crowd of 20,000 supporters in one of the handful of \"firewall\" states that protect Obama from the ignominy of a one-term presidency.</p> <p>Romney's campaigning took him from Florida through Virginia and Ohio, ahead of what should have been his final rally, in Manchester, New Hampshire.</p> <p>But, in a surprise announcement, his team said he would continue to campaign on election day itself. He will vote near his home in Belmont, Massachusetts, in the morning, before heading for Cleveland, Ohio, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</p> <p>More conventionally, Obama is to stay put in his home town, Chicago, on Tuesday.

  "<p>As I've commented earlier <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/occams-corner/2012/oct/02/obama-romney-better-us-science\">in this forum</a>, the US elections may have a dramatic impact on science and biomedical research. While both sides agree that cutting the deficit is a primary goal over the next four years, there is fierce disagreement about the way to achieve this. The Obama side has emphasised investments in infrastructure, research and development and education in parallel with cutting spending in other areas. The Romney side focuses more exclusively on cutting government spending and lowering taxes, but says little about support for research and infrastructure.</p> <p>Given the significance of the elections, there is obviously great interest in the US and perhaps in other parts of the globe in determining who is winning the race for the presidency \u2013 or more importantly \u2013 who will win. What is the answer to that question? Well, it all depends who you ask.</p> <p>Campaign managers and advisers to both sides almost inevitably claim their side is ahead; this seems to reflect the general (and odd, I might add) idea that some people want to be able to claim that they voted for the winning side. Whatever the reason, asking people affiliated with one party or the other isn't particularly helpful.</p> <p>What about the media? Normally I watch precious little television, but from every news network that I've seen over the past month (with the possible exception of Fox News, which typically predicts that Romney will readily win), the consensus appears to be a toss up. Polls show Obama up one day, with Romney in the lead on the next. Romney ahead in the national polls and leading in support by men, and Obama ahead in state polls with stronger support among women. Symmetrical and exciting. Close right down to the wire. This is the overwhelming dogma, and it certainly makes for great TV entertainment and advertising. But is it true?</p> <p>In search for an answer, and in trying to make sense of the situation, I have come across several very interesting blogs that address \"the state of the stats and the stats of the States\" as we move towards the elections on Tuesday. In particular, I have been relying heavily on the data provided by talented statistician and author <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Silver\" \">Nate Silver</a>, on his New York Times-affiliated blog, <em><a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/\" \">FiveThirtyEight</a></em> (the total number of US electoral votes, whereby a majority of 270 wins the election). In 2008, Silver accurately predicted 49 out of 50 states, missing only Indiana (which had less than a 1% difference between the two candidates).</p> <p>Silver is joined by other statistically inclined bloggers, including neuroscientist <a href=\"https://www.princeton.edu/neuroscience/news/archive/index.xml?id=1965\" \">Sam Wang</a>, an associate professor in the department of molecular biology and the Princeton Neuroscience Institute who runs the <a href=\"http://election.princeton.edu/\" \"><em>Princeton Election Consortium</em></a>, and <a href=\"http://userwww.service.emory.edu/~dlinzer/\" \">Drew Linzer</a>, an assistant professor of political science at Emory University who runs <a href=\"http://votamatic.org/\" \"><em>Votamatic</em></a>. </p> <p>The fascinating calculations made by these talented statisticians are mostly based on using averages of multiple polls, minimising the relevance of outlier polls, comparing state and national polls, registered voters vs. likely voters, and an array of other factors that can include economic considerations. In some cases, such as the FiveThirtyEight blog, economic data is a controlled variable that diminishes as the election approaches, because Silver notes that by election time the economy has inevitably already been factored into the voter's decision.</p> <p>According to these cautious and methodically tested calculations, the election results are exceedingly clear. For the coming election, in his measured and careful manner, Silver's <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/\">most recent forecast</a> shows that Obama has an 85% chance of winning the election, and if held on that day, would win about 305 electoral votes. <a href=\"http://election.princeton.edu/\">Sam Wang lists</a> 319 electoral votes for Obama with a Bayesian prediction of a Democrat victory with greater than 99% accuracy. <a href=\"http://votamatic.org/\">Linzer's Votamatic</a> predicts an Obama victory with 332 electoral votes. Hardly a \"toss-up\"!</p> <p>Remarkably, none of these careful statistical forecasts \u2013 by bloggers with a proven track record in previous elections \u2013 are echoed by the popular press. Claims of partisan predictions, biased polling and miscalculations abound. Are we, the people, missing something? Where do these differences come from?</p> <p>There are a good many potential explanations, and Silver and his fellow bloggers have addressed them in their recent blogs. For example, the news media have been heavily reliant on national polls \u2013 which according to data from recent elections are typically less reliable than state polls (especially when there are multiple state polls). The news media also tend to emphasise an individual poll as it comes out, without taking into consideration that it might be one of 6 or 7 polls and an outlier.</p> <p>The statistical bloggers admit that many of the polls conducted are by a number of large firms, and that there are clearly systematic differences in their polling. In other words, there are a cluster of polls that tend to produce more left-leaning results (by a few percentage points), and a cluster of large polling firms that produce results that are more favorable to the Romney side. </p> <p>In a recent blog, Linzer puts forth a strong argument that takes advantage of hundreds of new and recent polls performed by very small polling firms. His analysis shows that these many little polls, which can't possibly be systematically biased, on average support the larger polling firms that show Obama in the lead. The interpretation of this analysis is that the right-leaning large polling firms have been skewing the forecasts towards Romney, and that the race is thus tilted even more in Obama's direction.</p> <p>It remains unclear whether the news outlets are bent on making election night a tension-filled spectacle to increase network ratings, whether they are simply avoiding a complex and statistical-based analysis of the data, or whether they are merely being cautious. I simply don't know. What I do know is that I've already cast my early ballot, and I look forward to seeing the predictions of my statistical bloggers being fulfilled. While this election will clearly have an impact on US science, it's also great to see mathematicians-statisticians as heroes in the limelight.</p>",

  "<p>Lemmy has sent an election message to the US, decrying the Republican presidential nominee as a \"fucking monster\". In <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lemmy-mitt-romney-is-a-monster-20121105\" title=\"\">an interview with Rolling Stone</a>, the Mot\u00f6rhead leader pleaded with Americans: \"Please, please don't vote for Mitt Romney. Fuck him. Repeal abortion law is the first thing he'll do.\"</p> <p>Lemmy is not famed for his political involvement, frequently denying any ideological motive behind his collection of Nazi memorabilia. However, he was steadfast in his view on the presidential race. He suggested the US had not been ready for an African-American president in the form of Barack Obama, \"because they're trying to drag him down now. I mean, the poor fucker's only just gotten rid of all that George Bush shit that he left, or is trying to. And he's being stonewalled by the fucking Congress all the time. I don't know how he's gotten anything done. They should be glad. I mean the alternative is Mitt Romney.\"</p> <p>Lemmy had been speaking to Rolling Stone before a Chuck Berry tribute concert in Cleveland, Ohio, and proved he had lost none of his ability for a line that might best have been left unsaid. He said of Berry: \"I liked his attitude, talking to chicks, you know.\" In 1962, Berry was imprisoned for three years for transporting a minor across state lines for immoral purposes. In 1990, Berry settled out of court after being sued by several women for installing a video camera in the ladies' toilet at a restaurant he owned.</p>",

One was the terms of reference of the inquiry. It was set up to investigate the abuse of children in care homes. Although it looked at some of the paedophile activity in the immediate community around the Wrexham area, it didn't and it couldn't look at paedophile networks, perhaps even going beyond north Wales. That wasn't what it was primarily set up to do. </p> <p>Secondly, it's important to understand that the inquiry was not a police investigation. It could not arrest people, it could not charge people, it could not interview people under caution. It was reliant to a significant extent on the work that North Wales police had done previously. And by 1996, when the inquiry was set up, you had a complete breakdown of trust between many victims and North Wales police ... </p> <p>[The Waterhouse inquiry] a very thorough job with the evidence that it had. But what we are now talking about are a broader set of issues about broader networks. There are clearly allegations out there and we've seen over the last few weeks with the Savile issues how these kind of issues can come to light many years after the event. That's the nature of child abuse; it is often only many years after the event that things come to light.

There will also be a separate inquiry into whether the Waterhouse inquiry did its job properly, but details of that have not been announced yet.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 She said the government would consider the case for a wider, all-encompassing inquiry into child abuse.</strong> Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said Labour wanted a single, over-arching inquiry. May said that she did not see the case for one now, but that there could be one later. \"If, at the end of the processes that we've set in train it appears that it is necessary to move forward to a wider investigation then we will look at that,\" she said.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 May said Britain had \"an appalling and shameful\" record in relation to young people in care.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 May urged MPs not to use parliamentary privilege to name the senior Tory who is alleged to be involved in the north Wales abuse scandal.</strong> She said naming any suspects could jeopardise any future prosecution.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Tom Watson, the Labour party's deputy chair, accused May of being engaged in a \"cover-up\". </strong>He made the point in a question to May.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The lesson of Hillsborough and hacking is that a narrow-down investigation is the basic building block of a cover-up. To limit this inquiry to north Wales and Savile would in my view be a dereliction of the home secretary's duty. It would guarantee that many sickening crimes will remain uninvestigated and some of the most despicable paedophiles will remain protected by the establishment that has shielded them for 30 years. </p> </blockquote> <p>Watson said the new inquiry should follow any lead it finds. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Whether you were raped or tortured as a child in Wales or in Whitehall you are entitled to be heard. The media may be transfixed by the spectre of a paedophile cabinet minster abusing children, but what actually matters is that thousands and thousand of children, whose lives have been ground into nothing, who prefer to kill themselves than carry on, who have nowhere to turn, to whom nobody listens, whom nobody helps.

Cameron did not hand over any of his text messages or emails to the Leveson inquiry. </a>The story implies that the messages released by the inquiry between Cameron and Rebekah Brooks came from News International, not Downing Street.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>David Cameron has not handed over a single text message or email to the Leveson Inquiry, a No10 insider has revealed.</p> <p>It has fuelled claims of a cover-up and piled pressure on the PM to reveal all about his exchanges with ex-Sun editor Rebekah Brooks.</p> <p>Politicians of all parties now want him to publish the cache \u2013 said to run to at least 130 texts and emails.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2228413/Child-benefit-limited-children-bid-cut-bloated-welfare-bill.html\">\u2022 James Chapman in the Daily Mail says the Treasury is considering limiting child benefit to just two children.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The proposal goes further than Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith\u2019s suggestion that workless families could have child benefit and child tax credits limited if they insist on having more than two children.</p> <p>Instead, child benefit could be paid to all families, whether in work or not, for the first two offspring but not for subsequent children.</p> <p>Ministers say benefit would not be removed from existing families, so could only apply in the future.</p> <p>The reform would be far simpler to administrate than a complicated means-tested removal of benefit from lower income households.</p> </blockquote> <p>Paull Goodman at ConservativeHome says<a

Nadine Dorries is going to take part in I\u2019m a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The \u00a365,738-a-year MP, who dubbed the PM and Chancellor George Osborne

conference today that the government could save \u00a31.2bn over the next three years by moving government services online.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Addressing the Financial Times Innovate conference in London, the cabinet office minister will unveil a government digital strategy intended to make it easier for people to pay their car tax, book driving tests, complete tax returns or apply for the state pension online.</p> <p>He will say that the government handles more than one billion different transactions each year through 650 different services, but in only a few cases do a large majority of people opt for the online option.</p> <p>\u201cHalf don\u2019t offer a digital option at all and apart from a handful of services, if there is a digital option, few people use it because it\u2019s not a sufficiently fast or convenient option,\u201d Mr Maude will say.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article3591189.ece\">\u2022 Jill Sherman in the Times (paywall) says up to \u00a345bn from pension funds could be used to fund infrastructure projects.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Up to \u00a345 billion is to be raided from local authority pension funds to build houses, bridges and roads.</p> <p>Eric Pickles, the Communities Secretary, will unveil proposals today to let councils invest a third of their pension funds on infrastructure projects.</p> <p>It follows criticism from Lord Heseltine that the Treasury is not making enough use of pension funds to help the construction industry and create jobs. But unions have warned against investing members\u2019 pension savings into \u201cdodgy projects\u201d that can offer poor returns. Several of the private finance initiatives cost tens of millions of pounds more than expected.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/benedictbrogan/100187967/cleggs-tit-for-tat-retaliation-could-bring-about-the-coalitions-end/\">\u2022 Benedict Brogan in the Telegraph says the Lib Dems\u2019 determination to block the proposed parliamentary boundary changes could bring down the coalition.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Who cares about a spat over some obscure bit of Lords legislation? Except that what Mr Clegg added, perhaps as a little \u201cby the way\u201d when he and Mr Cameron had a brief word last Tuesday, is that it won\u2019t end in the Lords: he and all his ministers and backbenchers will vote with Labour when the legislation returns to the Commons. In other words, Mr Clegg will lead his party against the Government \u2013 against his own Bill \u2013 precipitating its near-certain defeat ...</p> <p>The effect, I fear, could be far more serious. If Mr Clegg\u2019s plan goes through, any pretence of collegiality between Tories and Lib Dems will end. Party discipline will collapse. Mr Cameron will be powerless to sanction his own rebels when the Lib Dems are allowed to defeat the Government \u2013 and Labour will look for other ways to tempt them across the floor.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/rachelsylvester/article3591143.ece\">\u2022 Rachel Sylvester in the Times (paywall) says very few Tories want Mitt Romney to win the US presidential election.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s remarkable how many senior Tories are privately hoping that Barack Obama will win. Brooks Newmark, the Harvard-educated Conservative MP, who attended the Republican Convention earlier this year, says: \u201cI\u2019m one of the only Tories rooting for Mitt Romney; it\u2019s almost like we\u2019re a secret society. The general sense in the tea room is that the majority of my colleagues would prefer Obama.

You cannot expect every country in the world to produce every tank, every ship, every plane that is necessary for that self defence. As a result, some form of defence sales internationally are inevitable. Britain has a very strong defence industry based on centuries of endeavour, and so it\u2019s right that there is a properly regulated arms and defence international business.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-06T11:03:38.384Z\">at 11.03am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5098dd1595cb1506d2444973\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-06T09:49:09.299Z\">9.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Mark Lewis,</strong> a lawyer who represented 15 victims at the original north Wales child abuse inquiry, told ITV's Daybreak that he thought the police did not follow up the allegations raised at the original inquiry properly.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think one of the problems and one of the challenges that comes out of the Waterhouse inquiry, this north Wales child abuse inquiry that took place back in 1997, is the fact that there was no substantive follow-up by the police and that is a key issue.</p> <p>There were 28 people who were named in the inquiry but were not publicly reported.

According to the story the Press Association filed overnight, he's also trying to drum up interest in wind farms. Here's the PA copy.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>David Cameron will push for massive new Middle Eastern investment in Britain's energy production today - including cash for windfarms as he continues a trade and diplomacy mission in the Gulf states. <br>The prime minister will meet the heads of three of the biggest sovereign wealth funds in the United Arab Emirates as he bids to persuade them to make further major investment in renewables, nuclear and North Sea oil. <br>It is the premier's latest attempt to secure a share of some of the \u00a3440 billion-plus cash surplus held by the oil-rich state to boost Britain's ailing economy after yesterday pushing sales of military fighter jets and meeting business leaders engaged in joint working with the UAE. <br>A week after the coalition was hit by a public split between ministers over whether to continue building turbines in the countryside, Cameron will put the focus firmly on the potential for reaping the winds off Britain's coastline. <br>Among those involved in a breakfast meeting to discuss potential future deals is Masdar, which contributed almost \u00a3500 million to the giant 175-turbine \u00a31.7 billion London Array wind farm off the coast of Essex and Kent which came on stream last month and is due to power 47,000 UK homes. <br>He will also discuss with the Abu Dhabi National Energy Company (TAQA) a tax break announced by chancellor George Osborne to encourage firms to seek to exploit older and deeper oil fields using new techniques. <br>And the talks will include the Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation, (ENEC) which is considering investment in plans for a new generation of nuclear plants boosted by Hitachi taking on the \u00a3700 million Horizon deal last week ...</p> <p>In an interview with The National newspaper in the Emirates he said: \"Emirati investment in the UK across a range of sectors - including real estate, banking, sport and infrastructure - is vital to our economy back in Britain. So we will continue to do all we can to make the UK an attractive and accessible investment destination\". <br>Cameron will move on to Saudi Arabia later today where he is due to hold talks with King Abdullah and other senior figures on issues such as Iran, Syria and anti-terrorism work. <br>But the latest leg of his three-day tour is bound to be dogged again by controversy over his push for trade - including arms deals - with countries which have faced criticism for their human rights records.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-0be85a55-2ab8-4832-8610-e0a925732fce\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/6/1352193692409/5a6799cd-1a97-408d-a18b-ff1328caa701-460.jpeg\" alt=\"David Cameron in Abu Dhabi.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Cameron is welcomed by government ministers to the Al Rawda palace in the city of Al Ain in Abu Dhabi.

There are allegations that a senior Tory was involved and that the original Waterhouse inquiry amounted to a cover-up and, in the light of the Jimmy Savile affair, ministers are determined to be seen to be taking child abuse allegations seriously. Theresa May, the home secretary, will be giving more details about the new inquiries in a Commons statement at 12.30pm and, on the Today programme, she said the government was right not to ignore the new claims being made, particularly those raised on Newsnight on Friday.

I really do think that in the face of these issues, which are, as I say, hugely shocking in relation to child abuse, that we do need to go back and say \u2018actually let\u2019s have a review of that inquiry to make sure that it did do the job that it was supposed to do\u2019.</p> </blockquote> <p>I\u2019ll be covering her statement in detail.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the full agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>9.30am:</em> John Griffith-Jones, the chairman designate of the Financial Conduct Authority, gives evidence to the Commons Treasury committee.</p> <p><em>10.30am:</em> John Hayes, the energy minister, gives evidence to the Commons energy committee about nuclear power.</p> <p><em>11am:</em> Theresa May, the home secretary, is interviewed on This Morning.</p> <p><em>11.30am:&#xa0;</em> Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, will take Treasury questions in the Commons.

  "<h2>Chuck Pagano remains part of the Colts' success</h2> <p>The light is still on in Chuck Pagano's office. When the Indianapolis Colts head coach was told he had leukemia, this September, Bruce Arians \u2013 the team's offensive co-ordinator and Pagano's interim replacement \u2013 requested that the light not be switched off until his colleague had returned to work. The team's owner, Jim Irsay, agreed.</p> <p>This week <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/football/nfl/10/29/colts-chuck-pagano-facility-visit.ap/index.html\">Pagano was back at the team's facility for the first time since that diagnosis</a>, visiting his colleagues and sitting in on team meetings for a few hours. It was made clear, however, that there is not yet any time-frame for a possible return to work. Pagano's treatment is ongoing, and from this week he is set to undergo a second round of chemotherapy.</p> <p>Sooner or later, though, Pagano intends to return. He made that clear when he followed up his practice-facility visit by attending the Colts' 23-20 win over Miami on Sunday, delivering a pep-talk to the team before the game and another afterwards. <a href=\"http://www.colts.com/media-center/videos/Coach-Pagano-Locker-Room-Speech-Dolphins/ab62385f-1e06-4136-b3d5-0cfde2a7a4fe\">A video of the post-game speech was posted online by the Colts</a>.</p> <p>Pagano praised the players for ignoring the expectations that analysts and others outside the organisation had for the team coming into the season, and focusing only on their own goals. He then compared their situation to his own. Powerful would be an understatement.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I mentioned before the game that you guys were living in [your] vision, and you weren't living in circumstances. Because you know where they had us in the beginning \u2013 every last one of them. But you refused to live in circumstances, and you decided consciously, as a team and as a family, to live in a vision. And that's why you bring things home like you brought home today. That's why you're already champions, and well on your way.</p> <p>I've got circumstances \u2013 you guys understand it, and I understand it. It's already beat. It's already beat. And my vision that I'm living is to see two more daughters get married, dance at their weddings, and then hoist that Lombardi [Trophy] several times. I'm dancing at two more weddings, and we're hoisting that trophy together, men.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Pagano's road to recovery is still a long one. He is responding well to treatment, and as of Monday <a href=\"http://www.indystar.com/article/20121105/SPORTS03/121105032/Doctors-Chuck-Pagano-s-cancer-remission?odyssey=mod|breaking|text|IndyStar.com&amp;nclick_check=1\">his doctors deemed the cancer to be in remission</a>. But the words written by Sports Illustrated's Peter King in his <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/peter_king/11/05/Week-9/index.html\">Monday Morning Quarterback column</a> hold true: </p> <blockquote> <p>The story doesn't have a happy ending. Yet. Not for the Colts, and not for Pagano. \"This next round of treatment's going to be brutal,'' Arians said. \"He could be down and out for a while. But he felt good today, and so he wanted to come in and see the guys. It helped, big time. It's good for him, good for us.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Arians had previously challenged his team to make the playoffs \u2013 extending their season so that Pagano would have more time to make it back from his treatment before it ended. With the Colts 5-3 after beating Miami and 4-1 since the coach's diagnosis, that no longer sounds as improbable as it once did.</p> <h2>Andrew Luck was worth that No1 pick...</h2> <p>Everyone will focus on the numbers. Andrew Luck's passing statistics were indeed remarkable on Sunday night \u2013 the quarterback threw for a rookie-record 433 yards, as well as two touchdowns and no interceptions, in the win over Miami. They also reflected to some extent how he gave his best in the clutch \u2013 going 13 of 17 for 204 yards and a score on third down.</p> <p>But to fully comprehend the brilliance of Luck's performance against Miami on Sunday you would have needed to see it: to witness how he moved in the pocket, how he went through progressions even when under pressure, the \"I don't see you but I know where you are\" awareness that allowed him to step away from pass rushers at the perfect moment.</p> <p>One play has dominated the highlight reels \u2013 Luck hit by the Miami defender Cameron Wake on third-and-three but <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/0ap2000000090776/Luck-and-Wayne-connect-on-key-third-down\">somehow contriving to throw a perfect six-yard dart to Reggie Wayne in traffic while falling</a>. Yet there were so many other less heralded moments, such as another third-and-three in the first quarter when a defender came flying at Luck's ankles \u2013 this time he stepped back to leave his opponent sprawling, before stepping up to hit Wayne on the sideline.</p> <p>\"He's going to be real special,\" said Wayne afterwards, and as a man who spent the first 10 years of his career catching passes from Peyton Manning, he should know. In a curious statistical quirk, Luck has now thrown for the exact same number of yards as Manning this season, and also has the exact same number of wins. His performance to date, though, is exciting for so much more than just numerical reasons.</p> <h2>...and Doug Martin was worth more than the 31st </h2> <p>If Luck looks like a natural then his fellow rookie Doug Martin is quick to acknowledge he is still learning his profession. The Tampa Bay running back, selected with the 31st overall pick in this year's draft, picked up just 31 yards on eight carries in the first half against the Raiders, before the team's head coach advised him that his tendency to dip his head while going through the line was causing him to lose his footing.</p> <p>\"I was getting to the line stumbling on a few runs and then coach told me: 'Just keep your head up,'\" said Martin. \"After that, I did what he said and it helped me keep my balance and then, it was off to the races.\"</p> <p>If these were indeed races then there was only one horse in them (or perhaps one Muscle Hamster, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JeffDarlington/statuses/265240761673609216\">as the player was nicknamed, much to his chagrin, at Boise State</a>). In the second half Martin would tear off touchdown runs of 45, 67 and 70 yards \u2013 as well as ploughing in for another score from one yard out. He would finish with 251 rushing yards \u2013 a team record and the 10th most in league history.</p> <p>His numbers might have looked even more impressive, too, were it not for the fact that he lost 14 on the Bucs' final drive, with the team trying to run out the clock. Or indeed if the team had not sent in LeGarrette Blount to spell Martin early in the fourth quarter, only to see him promptly cough up a fumble.</p> <p>And if no back could ever sustain this level of performance every game, then it is also true that Martin went for 214 total yards against the Minnesota Vikings last week. One or two of those teams who passed him up on draft day might be beginning to feel a little foolish.</p> <h2>Chicago's defense is scary</h2> <p>Life is about to get more difficult for the Bears, who face the Houston Texans and San Francisco 49ers over the next two weeks, but after seeing them demolish the Tennessee Titans 51-20 on Sunday it is easy to believe that they can live with both of those teams. They have outscored their opponents so far this season by an average of 14.5 points. Their points differential, +116, is the best in the league.</p> <p>The offense has been clicking \u2013 Jay Cutler throwing for three touchdowns, all of them to Brandon Marshall, on Sunday and Matt Forte averaging five yards per carry so far this season on the ground. But it is undoubtedly the defense that makes this team look ominous.</p> <p>Five turnovers against the Titans improved the Bears' turnover ratio to +16 on the season \u2013 the best such mark of any team in the league. Cornerback Charles \"Peanut\" Tillman forced four fumbles, moving him up to second on the all-time lists with 34 in his career. \"It's only a suggestion but CB Charles Tillman might want to consider a post-football career as a thief,\" <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/blog/nfl-rapidreports/20835474/bears-report-card-bigplay-defense-gets-joined-by-offense-special-teams\">wrote Gene Chamberlain on CBSSports.com</a>.</p> <p>Nor has this happened by accident. The Bears dedicate time in practice to forcing fumbles on defense as well as avoiding them on offense. <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/chris_harry/01/24/art.of.fumble/index.html\">So do many other teams</a>, of course, but right now Chicago are just doing it better.</p> <h2>Mitt Romney is going to win the presidential election.

  "<h2><strong>Worst gaffe</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>Hard to say, since this was the race in which the word lost all meaning: for weeks at a time, campaigning consisted solely of claiming the other side had gaffed.

How, they demanded, could his computer model keep showing such good news for the Democrats when old hands, like NBC's Joe Scarborough \u2013 simply by sniffing the air and studying their guts \u2013 knew that the race was \"tight as a tick\"? This was the <a href=\"http://unskewedpolls.com/\" title=\"\">election of \"unskewed\" polls</a> (translation: polls revised retroactively in order to favour your chosen candidate). And you can expect the \"war on math\" to get worse: as pollsters and campaigners get ever more sophisticated in their data-collection, commentators paid to speculate about the horse-race see their livelihoods at risk.</p> <h2><strong>Word least likely to be mentioned ever again by a Republican talking-head after the election, regardless of who wins</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong><a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/331977/benghazi-symbol-obama-s-leadership-mona-charen\" title=\"\">\"Benghazi\". </a></p> <h2><strong>Most alarmist prediction about what will happen if Obama is re-elected</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>These are all roughly the same: the dictatorship he'll usher in \u2013 aided, in many accounts, by a suddenly highly effective United Nations \u2013 <a href=\"http://washingtonexaminer.com/article/416176#.UJAGCVJJuSo\" title=\"\">will end democracy as we know it, making America a \"vassal state to a globalist entity\"</a> and confiscating everybody's guns.

Nate Silver uses it, too!</p> <h2><strong>Worst public-speaking performance by a candidate or one of his surrogates </strong></h2> <p>A crowded field, given Rick Perry's splendid primary performance \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/rick-perrys-oops-in-republican-debate-could-have-long-lasting-implications-for-his-campaign-video/2011/11/09/gIQAqUBr6M_blog.html\" title=\"\">\"Oops!\" the Texas governor declared, when he realised he couldn't recall his own policies</a> \u2013 and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/31/clint-eastwood-chair-speech-romney\" title=\"\">Clint Eastwood's surreal double-act with an empty chair on stage at the Republican convention</a>.

Sure, in reality, your candidate lost. But that doesn't matter: your candidate won.</p> <h2><strong>Andy Warhol award for the person made briefly world-famous during the campaign with the least justification</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>Republican primary candidate Herman Cain.

(Remember Matt Drudge's supposedly shocking video of Obama's \"other race speech\"? Neither does anyone else.) Here's what happened instead: the two campaigns and their <a href=\"http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/campaign-finance\" title=\"\">super-PAC backers spent more than $1.8bn</a>; avoided the biggest issues; focused on trading insults; tailored their messages for the benefit of a few undecided voters in Ohio; and made sure their candidates were never subjected to tough interviews. This went on for months on end, until Ohio, the nation and the world were thoroughly disillusioned and annoyed. Great job, everyone!</p>",
  "<p>At long last, the candidates will fall silent, the pollsters will put away their clipboards and the hush of election day will descend on America. In their tens of millions, watched anxiously by billions more around the world, Americans will finally end a long and bitter campaign, cast their votes and choose a president.</p> <p>In a frenzied closing day, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney crammed in final visits to key battleground states \u2013 the president ending what, win or lose, will be his last campaign in the place where his \"improbable journey\" began nearly five years ago, in rural, midwestern Iowa. There is little more they can do.</p> <p>Their fates lie now with the machines they have built on the ground, the efficiency of their get-out-the-vote operations and, of course, with the voters themselves.</p> <p>The president acknowledged as much when he addressed a rally in the frigid night air of Bristow, Virginia, late on Saturday. \"I'm sort of a prop in the campaign,\" Obama said, conceding that at this late stage organisation is king.</p> <p>As to who is the more confident of victory, there the battle is less between Obama and Romney than between two political tribes: the priests and the mathematicians.</p> <p>Those of a scientific bent, who crunch the numbers and regard the uber-analyst and blogger Nate Silver as a secular deity, believe the contest is all but in the bag for the Democrat.</p> <p>Yes, the national polls may be locked in a statistical tie, but in the decisive states \u2013 chief among them Ohio, where Romney will make one more, tradition-defying visit on Tuesday \u2013 Obama has held a narrow but consistent lead, one that firmed up during the final weekend.</p> <p>Experience suggests election eve polls tend to be borne out on the day itself. The mathematicians say Romney's path to 270 electoral college votes has become so convoluted as to be near-impossible.</p> <p>To win, they argue, he would need to be comfortably ahead in the likes of Virginia and Colorado and he is not. They cite 2004, when incumbent George W Bush was similarly deadlocked in national polls only to beat John Kerry.</p> <p>They confidently expect Obama to repeat the trick, while one bookmaker, Paddy Power, has already paid out \u00a3400,000 to punters who backed the president. Silver gives Obama an 86.3% chance of victory.</p> <p>The priests however \u2013 a fraternity that currently includes many Republicans \u2013 insist such certainty is impossible. An election is a human event, with too many variables. They note the polling that says independent voters are breaking for Romney in Ohio, which would usually point to success. They argue that the electorate is not the same as it was in 2008, that there will be fewer young and African-American voters and that that will hurt Obama. They point to specific counties where early voting indicates Democratic turnout down and Republican turnout substantially up.</p> <p>That's hardly a surprise, say many Democrats, considering what they call \"voter suppression\" efforts by Republican state officials, closing polling stations and cutting short early voting in heavily Democratic areas. Tellingly, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/02/us/politics/campaigns-brace-to-sue-for-votes-in-crucial-states.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" title=\"\">the Obama campaign has 2,500 lawyers</a> on standby in Ohio alone, just in case things get close and ugly.</p> <p>Most unexpectedly, Republicans have seized on Pennsylvania, which their party has not won since 1988 but where a poll showed Obama's earlier lead wiped out, the two men on 47% each. If Pennsylvania is genuinely wobbling, that would spell disaster for the president.</p> <p>Publicly, the Obama camp dismissed the poll as rogue and politically tainted. But they took it seriously enough to deploy their biggest gun, sending a hoarse Bill Clinton to do four events in the state on Monday.</p> <p>Above all, the priesthood points to those intangibles they say the data-analysts miss. Romney is addressing large, enthused rallies which, they believe, do not suggest a candidate heading to defeat. On Friday, the Republican brought out between 20,000 and 30,000 to West Chester, Ohio. This same weekend, an Obama event saw only around 2,000 Ohioans fill a high school gym in Cleveland.</p> <p>Still, Democrats can cite intangibles of their own. On Saturday night, some 25,000 braved icy temperatures to attend that late night rally in Virginia.</p> <p>They whooped their delight at seeing two presidents, Clinton and Obama, high-five and hug, memories of the 2008 battle between them safely buried. The eyes of supporters may not have shone with hope and expectation the way they did when Obama addressed an election eve crowd of more than 80,000 in the state four years ago. \"But now there's real strong determination to let him finish his work,\" volunteer Richard Russey, 60, told me. Next to him, Sharon Jenkins, 54, said she was part of a \"veritable army\" of Obama activists that was bigger than in 2008.</p> <p>What's intriguing is the absence on both sides of what New York Times columnist Ross Douthat calls the \"aura of defeat\", defined as a losing campaign's tendency to go negative, hyping up trivial issues to motivate core supporters and seizing on minor slip-ups by the other side. A fortnight ago, Douthat detected that aura around Obama.</p> <p>But in the final days, there was little sign of it. In Bristow, Obama's closing argument focused firmly on the big picture, even extending to some Martin Luther King style rhetoric. \"It's up to you,\" he told them. \"You've got the power. That's why I need you, Virginia. Don't get tired, don't get weary.\"</p> <p>Romney too exudes confidence. On Monday he addressed an energetic, flag-waving indoor crowd in Fairfax, Virginia who cheered every time he spoke of \"when I'm president,\" urging them to make the \"one final push\" that would bring \"a new tomorrow.\"</p> <p>But there is the odd lurch into that losing mode of behaviour. On Monday Romney was still attacking Obama for suggesting voters should get their \"revenge\" at the ballot box, a remark Fox News and the Republicans interpreted as a coded call for class war. In fact it was nothing of the sort, but that didn't stop Romney piously insisting that voters be motivated not by revenge, but \"love of country\".</p> <p>More important, there have been the first signs of Republicans turning on each other, getting their retaliation in early. Chief among these \"precriminations\" is the view that Romney failed to reach beyond white America, that their party is too concentrated in the deep south and the great plains.</p> <p>The mathematicians would say Republicans are right to have that argument now. The priests say they should wait, that elections can surprise you.</p> <p>Who will win this battle of data against instinct, of head versus gut? Today will settle that \u2013 and much else besides.</p>",

In the Iowan capital Des Moines, Obama spoke to a packed downtown rally of 20,000 people braving freezing temperatures.</p> <p>It was a moment of poignant memories for the First Couple. \u201cI have come back to Iowa one more time to ask for your vote,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is where our movement began.\u201d</p> <p>Obama recounted tales of his early campaign, talking of a bare bones operation in 2008 that turned American politics on its head. \u201cYou welcomed me and Michelle into your homes,\u201d he said. He also told a lengthy anecdote about how his old campaign slogan of \u201cfired up, ready to go\u201d came about at a South Carolina event.</p> <p>Michelle Obama also took the stage and reminisced about past campaign events in Iowa, including \u2013 apparently \u2013 once seeing her spouse\u2019s face carved out of butter. The First Lady spoke softly, despite a microphone, and was clearly feeling the magnitude of the moment. \u201cThis is an emotional time for us. This is the final event of my husband\u2019s final campaign,\u201d she said.

Then he appealed to Iowa voters to stick with him at tomorrow\u2019s ballot boxes. \u201cWe are not done yet on this journey. We have got more road to travel,\u201d he said. But it was not all positive, saying Mitt Romney wanted to take America backwards. \u201cafter all that we have fought through together we cannot give up on change now,\u201d Obama said.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-12e16bd8-16b9-4a91-a2bc-a96078f4723f\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/6/1352177559597/4dd97e9a-e937-4655-bb8a-5729897b0e65-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Barack Obama final rally in Iowa\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama speaks during his last rally in Des Moines, Iowa.

Even if he wins, Obama will not run for office again. This is it.</p> <p>The choice of Iowa seems political, sentimental and practical. Political because Iowa\u2019s six electoral college votes could really matter in a tight election. Iowa is a swing state and up for grabs and some serious presidential attention could be vital. Sentimental because this is the state were it all began way back in January 2008, when Obama beat Hillary Clinton in the caucus here, proving a black outsider could win over white voters with a powerful message of change. Practical because its near Chicago. Once this event is over then it is a short hop home to wait for the results.</p> <p>Certainly the crowds are showing up as thousands of people queued through the streets of downtown Des Moines, braving chilly air and a several-hour-long wait. Though their patience is almost certainly helped by the added attraction of a free Bruce Springsteen concert. You do not get to see The Boss that often in these parts. The event is happening in a knot of streets called the East Village (no relative to the New York neighbourhood). Already a drum band is playing as a large crowd packs into the area, stretching back to Des Moine's Capitol building.</p> <p>Shannon Minschall, a 41-year-old nursing home worker, scored seats in the front row thanks to his sister being the sign language interpreter for the evening. He was exceedingly positive about Obama\u2019s chances of winning the state. \u201cI think he will take it by at least four points,\u201d he said. \u201cConsidering the people he\u2019s had road blocking him in Congress for four years, I think he has done a good job.\u201d But Minschall did admit there was an enthusiasm gap among Democrats. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the same enthusiasm as last time but people will show up. They know it is too important,\u201d he added. But in the meantime there is history in the making: Obama\u2019s last rally.</p> <p>Which, makes this correspondent a little nostalgic. I was in the convention hall when Obama gave his 2004 speech in Boston. I went to a 2006 fundraiser at Conde Naste in Manhattan when he was mulling a run (and the mistaken conventional wisdom was he would not). Then came 2008 versus Hillary and after that, the battle versus John McCain and Sarah Palin and the Great Recession. Now it's 2012 and his last ever campaign rally. Even though Obama might have a second term ahead of him, it all shows how remarkably quickly American politics can work.

Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley even compared President Barack Obama to King George III. \u201cWe got to make sure we have a president that doesn't think he\u2019s king,\u201d he said, in attack line that was new \u2013 and bizarre - to me.</p> <p>Local Iowa state senator Bard Zaun struck a more reasoned tone: rejecting Obama more from sorrow than anger. \u201cHe is a good man. A family man. But it is about job performance,\u201d Zaun said. That sounded fair enough for a Republican on election eve. But then Zaun spoiled it with the old canard that Obama has taken America on some sort of dangerous foreign tangent. \u201cIs there anyone here who would like to become a European nation?\u201d Zaun asked. \u201cNo!\u201d the crowd roared back. But, look, just this week it was announced the <a href=\"http://www.li.com/media/press-releases/2012-legatum-prosperity-index-american-dream-at-risk-in-key-election-year\">US has crashed out of the top ten of the world\u2019s most prosperous nations</a>. And of those ten nations? Seven are European. That doesn\u2019t sound too bad.</p> <p>Ryan himself emerged to chants of \u201cone more day!\u201d from the audience, which was around 1,000 strong. Ryan, whose voice hinted at being hoarse after a punishing schedule in recent weeks, hit his usual notes of painting tomorrow\u2019s vote as generational in importance.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not just picking a president for four years. We are picking a path for our nation,\u201d he said. He talked about the economy and the need for change, painting the familiar picture of a broken country, high joblessness and mounting debts, both personal and national. \u201cWe can fix this,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Then he used a more recent attack line picking up on comments Obama made for supporters to vote out of \u201crevenge\u201d. The comment has been made into a radio ad already playing on Iowa airwaves. \u201cThat is not hope and change. That is not aspirational. That is not what we do in this country.

Yglesias' short answer: you can count on Republicans to run budget deficits:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Yet insofar as I have to guess, I think short-term growth will be faster under Romney than Obama for three reasons. First, in the post-1980 era you get bigger budget deficits with Republicans in the White House than with Democrats and that's a good thing in the short-term. Second, the Federal Reserve seems to be biased and&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/10/25/political_business_cycle_federal_reserve_policy_favors_republicans.html\">delivers looser monetary policy with Republicans in the White House</a>.

Minority, specifically black, voters have grown in their support of same-sex marriage since President Obama announced his backing for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/gay-marriage\">gay marriage</a> in May: it seems to be a rare example where the president's bully pulpit has actually worked.</p> </blockquote> <p>They're talking a lot about gay marriage in Maryland these days.

I've argued before that Romney would face some obvious problems in the crisis with Iran: His foreign policy team will be inexperienced; as a Republican, he would face extraordinary opposition from a revitalized anti-war movement and from Democrats in Congress; he himself doesn't want to gain the reputation George W, Bush gained for himself, and so on.
