  "<p>Among the publishers of books on How To Succeed in work and life, there's a widespread notion that prominent politicians have much to teach the rest of us \u2013 and that American presidents are the wisest life coaches of all. There are texts on how to lead like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Leadership-Barack-Obama-Way-Teambuilding/dp/0071664025\" title=\"\">Obama</a>, innovate like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Presidential-Lessons-Leadership-Executives-Presidents/dp/0761853529/\" title=\"\">FDR</a> and cultivate optimism like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Common-Sense-Uncommon-Man/dp/0785275487/\" title=\"\">Reagan</a>. The latest addition to this stable, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Obama-Karma-Lessons-Inspired-President/dp/0984954317/\" title=\"\">Obama Karma</a>, by the British psychiatrist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/russell-razzaque\" title=\"\">Russell Razzaque</a>, explores the current president's \"emotional intelligence\", and it's a genuinely thought-provoking work. But when it comes to the presidents-as-gurus genre as a whole, I'm sceptical. Why assume that running a country is anything like running a business, let alone a family? Just because you've got what it takes to be president, it doesn't mean you are an expert on living sanely. Indeed, the opposite may be true: according to a new paper in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, the most successful presidents share key character traits with <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/13/health/psychopathic-presidents-traits-time/index.html\" title=\"\">psychopaths</a>.</p> <p>So it was refreshing to discover some properly useful tips in Michael Lewis's much-trumpeted, 15,000-word profile of Obama in October's <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2012/10/michael-lewis-profile-barack-obama\" title=\"\">Vanity Fair</a>. The president, Lewis reveals, is up to speed on research into <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/magazine/do-you-suffer-from-decision-fatigue.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">\"decision fatigue\"</a>, which suggests that making decisions depletes your capacity for making further decisions; accordingly, he tries to eliminate unnecessary choices. \"I&#xa0;wear only grey or blue suits,\" he told Lewis. \"I'm trying to pare down decisions\u2026 You need to focus your decision-making energy. You need to routinise yourself.\" You needn't be making decisions about military interventions to find this approach useful. In any life, there are minutiae, and there are things that matter. Being monotonous in your handling of the former means you stand more chance of excelling in the latter.</p> <p>Not long after Lewis's piece came out, the Washington website <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0912/81280.html\" title=\"\">Politico</a> published a dissection of the failures of Obama's rival, Mitt Romney, and it is a fascinating reminder that there's sometimes more to learn from how politicians screw up than from their successes. Romney \u2013 as he explains in a book called <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Turnaround-Crisis-Leadership-Olympic-Games/dp/0895260840\" title=\"\">Turnaround</a>, his own contribution to political self-help \u2013 is famed for his organisational and crisis-management skills. Yet, Politico claims, his campaign is in chaos because he can't delegate efficiently and panics in emergencies. Which suggests a lesson you won't find in Turnaround: if you're certain you know what your strengths are, consider that you might be wrong \u2013 precisely because you've always assumed they're strengths and thus not in need of improvement.</p> <p>The psychologist Steven Reiss has a different theory about why Romney keeps making wealth-related gaffes: <a href=\"http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/who-we-are/201209/why-mitt-romney-keeps-messing\" title=\"\">\"self-hugging\"</a>. This refers to the mistake people make when they discover that something brings them gratification \u2013 in his case, high status \u2013 then imagine they've discovered something universal about human nature. \"Romney tells people how wealthy he is to impress them,\" Reiss argues, because he can't imagine anyone not agreeing that being a&#xa0;plutocrat is marvellous. His critics, he assumes, can only be motivated by envy; it never occurs to him that they might simply have a different definition of the good life, in which status isn't so highly valued. That's the built-in problem, psychologically speaking, with our political leaders: they're generally the kind of people who think being a political leader is the best thing in the world.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:\" title=\"\">oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com</a></p> <p>Follow Oliver on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/oliverburkeman\" title=\"\">Twitter</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Brazil's president made a timely, though probably innocent, intervention during Britain's party political conference season when she hailed the importance of stimulating economic growth.</p> <p>President Dilma Rousseff, a former Marxist, said it was important to stimulate the economy during a downturn.</p> <p>Standing next to David Cameron, who is pushing an austerity programme in the UK, she delivered a speech at the presidential palace in Brasilia that could gave been written by the Labour party.</p> <p>She said: \"I stressed the importance of expanding efforts with a view to improving the conditions that will prove conducive to a recovery of the international economy, not only as regards developed countries but also as regards emerging countries,\" said the socialist president.</p> <p>\"I have told the prime minister that Brazil has done its share in efforts to improve the recovery of the world economy by means of stimuli to jobs and growth.\"</p> <p>The president lavished praise on Cameron for his successful visit to Brazil, saying she was impressed that he visited all three main cities \u2013 S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Brasilia.</p> <p>Cameron responded by supporting Brazil's campaign to have a permanent seat on the UN security council. He said: \"As Brazil takes its place on the global stage, so it's case for permanent membership of the UN security council becomes ever stronger. We support Brazilian membership.</p> <p>\"We won't always agree about every issue, but what's important is that we have open and honest conversations about the difficult issues and form practical partnerships to get things done together.\"</p> <p>Cameron ended his trip to Brazil by launching a treaty to encourage the production of more Anglo-Brazilian blockbuster films.</p> <p>Speaking at his press conference with Rousseff, Cameron said he wanted to see more productions of films such as the James Bond adventure Moonraker that was shot in Rio.</p> <p>Cameron, who claims to be a big Bond fan, said: \"In film [we have agreed] a new film co-production treaty which will offer incentives for our budding film makers to work together and make a new generation of blockbusters with those unforgettable moments like Bond hanging over Sugar Loaf Mountain.\"</p> <p>The treaty, signed by the trade minister Lord Green and the Brazilian foreign minister Antonio Patriota, was one of 10 treaties signed during his visit to Brasilia.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 1 October 2012 because the original said described Antonio Patriota as the Brazilian culture minister. He is the foreign minister.</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron and Nick Clegg were at odds over the EU on Friday night after the deputy prime minister warned of the dangers of abandoning British involvement in the European arrest warrant.</p> <p>Hours after the prime minister said Britain would opt out of a series of EU law and order measures, the deputy prime minister said the value of the warrant was highlighted by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/28/megan-stammers-jeremy-forrest-found-bordeaux\" title=\"\">arrest in France of the teacher Jeremy Forrest</a>.</p> <p>Clegg spoke out after the prime minister <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/28/david-cameron-referendum-euro-crisis\" title=\"\">reached out to eurosceptics</a> by confirming that the British people would be given a say, possibly in a referendum, on any new EU settlement after the next general election. In an interview with Sky News in Rio de Janeiro, Cameron said major changes to the EU in the light of the eurozone crisis would require \"fresh consent\" from the British people.</p> <p>In a sign of a more immediate hardline approach, the prime minister said that Britain would exercise its rights to stand apart from a series of justice and home affairs measures later this year.</p> <p>Asked by the BBC whether Britain would opt out of EU justice and policing powers, he said: \"That has to be done before the end of the year, and the opt out is there. We'll be exercising that opt out.\"</p> <p>His remarks mean Britain will withdraw from 140 measures on justice and home affairs, including the European arrest warrant, later this year. The arrest warrant was used to capture one of the July 2005 bombers.</p> <p>Britain will then embark on a process of negotiations to opt in to some of the 140 measures. This is technically not allowed under EU rules which say that a country can either wholly opt in or wholly opt out.</p> <p>Clegg made clear he would press Cameron hard to maintain the arrest warrant. In a statement, his office said: \"The value of EU police co-operation has been demonstrated only today with the arrest using the European arrest warrant of Jeremy Forrest. Any opt out in this area is still under review and discussion. Our decision must follow the interests of national security, public safety and Britain's international reputation for leadership on cross-border security matters.\"</p> <p>In his remarks about consulting voters on changes to the EU, Cameron stopped short of specifically mentioning a referendum because the timing of a new EU agreement could mean it would make more sense to seek the consent of voters in a general election. The fact that he says the decision will come after the next election show he thinks EU negotiations on new eurozone governance arrangements will proceed slowly.</p> <p>The prime minister told Sky News: \"When we achieve that new settlement, I think we will be able to seek fresh consent from the British people. I will be setting that out in the autumn.\"</p> <p>Cameron, who is facing intense political pressure from the UK Independence party in the runup to the 2014 European parliamentary elections, believes voters will need to be consulted if the EU agrees a major treaty revision in the next few years.</p> <p>Eurozone leaders are expected to agree wide-ranging changes to the governance of the single currency, possibly by moving towards a fiscal union, to avoid a repeat of the eurozone crisis.</p> <p>Britain will not be part of the new arrangements, but major changes will have to be agreed by all 27 EU members in a new treaty or a revision to the Lisbon treaty.</p> <p>The prime minister is planning to use the treaty negotiations, in which Britain would have a veto, to recast Britain's relationship with the EU by repatriating powers. It is expected he will ask for the contents of the social chapter on social and employment laws, which is now sprinkled in various places of the Lisbon treaty, to be repatriated.</p> <p>Clegg's spokesperson said: \"The fresh settlement is essentially what David Cameron, as leader of his party, has said before. There is currently no process of treaty change under way and no treaty change proposal on the table.</p> <p>\"In 2011, the government legislated for an act to enable the British people to have the final say in any treaty change that pools further UK powers at the European level. As the PM said, EU membership is clearly in Britain's national interests, and in the interests of jobs, growth and investment in this country.\"</p> <p>Cameron will tread with care because Britain does not know when a major treaty revision will take place and he does not want to undermine Britain's negotiating position by sounding too shrill about a referendum.</p> <p>Some eurozone leaders want prompt action, but Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the European commission president, has called for a slower approach. In his state of the union address recently, he floated the idea of using the results of elections to the European parliament in 2014 as a way of establishing a negotiating framework.</p> <p>Britain expects a slower approach because German chancellor Angela Merkel is focused on next year's federal elections. But Cameron feels the need to speak out now because there will be three EU summits before Christmas covering a banking union for the eurozone, the next seven-year EU budget and the eurozone crisis.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama has revoked a Chinese company's acquisition of four wind farms, citing national security for the first time in two decades against a foreign investor.</p> <p>The executive order from the White House on Friday, against the privately held Ralls Corporation, follows accusations from Mitt Romney that Obama has failed to stand up to Chinese businesses.</p> <p>The president said in the executive order he had \"credible evidence\" that Ralls \"might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States\".</p> <p>Ralls had been installing wind turbines made by another privately held Chinese firm, the Sany Group, at a site close to restricted air space used by a Navy weapons systems training facility in northern Oregon.</p> <p>Ralls will now be forced to shelve the project, and divest its interests in the wind farm projects that it acquired earlier in the year.</p> <p>It was the first time a president has invoked national security against a foreign investor since 1990 when the first President George Bush blocked a state-owned Chinese aero-technology company from obtaining a US manufacturer.</p> <p>The treasury department said in a statement that Friday's decision was an exceptional case. \"The President's decision is specific to this transaction and is not a precedent with regard to any other foreign direct investment from China or any other country,\" the statement said.</p> <p>Concerns about the Chinese firms' involvement in the wind farms first surfaced last spring, after the company bought the projects.</p> <p>The US navy objected to the siting of the project, and the treasury department's foreign investment committee ordered Ralls to halt construction on the project pending a government review. Ralls sued to reverse the order earlier this month.</p> <p>Even so, Friday's order from Obama will likely be seen within context of an election race in which Obama and Romney are trying to demonstrate who could best protect US jobs and manufacturing from Chinese competitors.</p> <p>Romney, on the campaign trail, has called China a currency manipulator. The Obama camp meanwhile has been running television ads in battleground states claiming Romney's Bain Capital shut down American firms and shipped overseas.</p>",

But in whose interests are these \"tough choices\" being made? Certainly not the young unemployed, the low-paid, the old, disabled and, in fact, all those \"plebs\" outside the tight cabal of the 1% who have now so colonised political discourse that we are invited to regard abject moral cowardice as daring.</p> <p>Our political classes, fused in a grand coalition of austerity, will no doubt caricature resistance on the streets on 20 October as the work of utopians and dreamers. But if they persist in their willful indifference to a crisis that is close to engulfing not only society, but a political system which legitimises the commercialisation of public services, the closure of refuges and children's services and the slashing of benefits, while financial corruption goes unchecked, they can hardly say that they were not warned.<br><strong>Mike Cowley</strong><br><em>Edinburgh</em></p> <p>\u2022 The problem with Polly Toynbee's thesis (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/27/labour-may-be-better-in-coalition?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Comment</a>, 28 September) that the last Labour government would have been better in coalition with the Lib Dems, is based on a false premise, ie that they would pursue policies in government with Labour that they voted for in opposition. All the evidence from the last two years shows this to be false. On the core economic issue, in opposition, they always wanted higher levels of expenditure; yet in government they have supported ineffective Thatcherite monetarist polices. There can be, therefore, little confidence that on key issues such as Iraq and Trident, the Lib Dems would not have performed similar political acrobatics. Listening carefully to the Lib Dem leadership at their conference justifying their current participation in coalition it is absolutely clear that power is more important to them than principle. Labour should not do a shoddy deal with a party that is indistinguishable from the Tories when it comes to dismantling the welfare state. <br><strong>Graham Stringer MP</strong><br><em>Lab, Blackley and Broughton </em></p> <p>\u2022 Does Nick Clegg think we are all economically illiterate? The big lie behind austerity is that without it we would be in the same boat as the Greeks. But we had a choice and the Tories chose austerity instead of progressive taxation to give themselves the pretext for privatising the NHS &#xa0;and removing the welfare safety net. Clegg's excuse of reforming the House of Lords in return for putting them in power has been blown out of the water, and he has no right to trade his party for the post of deputy Prime Minister. Now, more than ever, we must fulfil our party's role of speaking truth to power. <em>Magna est veritas et prae valebit</em> \u2013 for the benefit of the PM: truth is mighty and shall prevail.<br><strong>Margaret Phelps</strong><br><em>Colchester, Essex</em></p> <p>\u2022 Labour appears to be content to wait for the 2015 election (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/26/ed-miliband-prime-minister-manchester?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Alan Johnson</a>, 28 September). By that time, many of the coalition's regressive actions \u2013 on health, education, welfare and the environment \u2013 will be irreversible. The emphasis has to be on getting the coalition out as soon as possible. Perhaps Labour leaders hesitate because they wouldn't know what to do if handed power now?<br><strong>Frank Hibberd</strong><br><em>Coventry</em></p>",
  "<p>Todd Akin has issues with women. And so does his Republican party.</p> <p>Akin, of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/20/todd-akin-legitimate-rape-romney\">\"legitimate rape\" fame</a>, is now complaining that his Democratic opponent, Claire McCaskill, had the nerve to actually campaign against him. McCaskill's decision to run a standard political campaign was <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/09/27/akin-mccaskill-more-ladylike-in-last-election/\">apparently not properly \"ladylike\"</a>, and Akin is offended at her aggressiveness. No, really; here's the quote:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I think we have a very clear path to victory, and apparently Claire McCaskill thinks we do, too, because she was very aggressive at the debate, which was quite different than it was when she ran against Jim Talent. She had a confidence and was much more ladylike [in 2006], but in the debate on Friday she came out swinging, and I think that's because she feels threatened.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Personally, I think it's a good thing for women to come out swinging, whether they're facing down a \"legitimate rapist\" who thinks he has the right to violate women's bodies, or a misogynist political opponent who thinks he has the right to control women's bodies. And it's some pretty sweet irony to hear the man who says women can't become pregnant from \"legitimate rape\" also suggesting that women shouldn't fight back when they feel threatened because aggressive self-defense is unladylike.</p> <p>Ladies, apparently, should lie back and take it.</p> <p>Akin's problems aren't limited to his own backwards views on women, or even the repeated slip-ups that reveal <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2012/08/20/todd_akin_s_legitimate_rape_comment_not_a_misstatement_but_a_worldview_.html\">the depth of those views</a>. A look at his past comments and at his voting record shows that Akin fundamentally doesn't trust women, and he definitely doesn't trust rape victims. Akin doesn't just have a far-right anti-abortion voting record; <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/rosiegray/missouri-senate-candidate-praised-right-wing-milit\">he praises rightwing militias with ties to radical anti-abortion action</a>. He opposed the creation of a sex offender registry. (Tracking rapists is too aggressive and unladylike, perhaps?) When voting for legislation that would have finally made it possible to prosecute husbands for raping their wives, Akin supported the bill but worried that the legislation might be used \"in a real messy divorce as a tool and a legal weapon to beat up on the husband\". He co-sponsored the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, which changed the definition of rape by specifying that government-sponsored healthcare dollars would only pay for abortion if a pregnancy was caused by \"forcible\" rape, instead of just regular old rape. </p> <p>Akin repeatedly uses terms like \"legitimate rape\" as synonyms for \"forcible rape\". That means, simply, that Akin will accept that you were \"legitimately\" raped if a stranger jumps out of the bushes and assaults you. If you're assaulted by your partner, or an acquaintance, or a sports coach, or a guy at a frat party? Not \"legitimate\".</p> <p>It's easy to write all of this off as a problem with Akin himself. The man clearly does have some misogyny issues. But Akin's antiquated views on rape, abortion and women's rights <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/28/todd-akin-missouri-women\">aren't his alone</a>; they're standard GOP fare. </p> <p>Even as some members of the Republican party tried to cast Akin's \"legitimate rape\" and abortion comments as personal and fringe, the GOP amended its platform to be stricter on abortion, <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/21/g-o-p-approves-strict-anti-abortion-language-in-party-platform/\">calling for a constitutional amendment that would outlaw abortion in all cases, including when the pregnancy was a result of rape or incest</a>. A plain reading of the <a href=\"http://www.gop.com/2012-republican-platform_We/\">party plank</a> is also clear that the Republican abortion ideal wouldn't include exceptions even if the pregnant woman was going to die from the pregnancy. Unborn children have a right to life; adult women do not.</p> <p>The attempt to restrict abortion access to women who were \"forcibly\" raped, and not just \"regularly\" raped, was also a GOP-wide phenomenon and not a solo Akin move; <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/frame_game/2012/08/todd_akin_s_apology_his_comments_on_spousal_rape_and_forcible_rape_show_mistrust_of_women_.html\">more than 160 members of Congress</a> (almost all Republicans) co-sponsored that bill before widespread outrage obliged the withdrawal of the word \"forcible\". And it wasn't Todd Akin who blocked the Violence Against Women Act from passing; it was <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/03/republicans-violence-against-women-act\">other well-placed members of the GOP who opposed the legislation</a> because it offered protection from violence to immigrant women and LGBT people.</p> <p>All of this \u2013 the belief that some rape victims are more legitimate than others, the hostility toward women who are \"aggressive\" and \"unladylike\", the refusal to protect women from violence if those women are immigrants or lesbians \u2013 reflects the GOP's fundamental view that women are not equal citizens. The entire Republican social platform is structured around the idea of the \"traditional family\", where men are in the public sphere as breadwinners and heads of households, and women stay in private, taking care of children and serving as helpmeets to their husbands. The conservative worldview sees men as naturally in charge, and women as naturally nurturing and supportive of male authority.</p> <p>Unfortunately, for the GOP, it turns out that when you give women a little bit of freedom, they take it \u2013 and women, too, want to be in charge of their own lives. Since that doesn't fit into the social conservative ideal, the GOP is left trying to hamstring women's freedom through sexist legislation. </p> <p>A woman having the right to determine for herself the number and spacing of her children, through access to contraception, sex education and abortion? That doesn't fit the ideal. A woman saying that her body is <em>hers</em>, and that she has the right not to be physically violated through sexual violence or forced pregnancy? That doesn't fit the ideal. A woman running for public office against a man, and not pulling any punches? That doesn't fit the ideal. </p> <p>These aren't a few wayward comments from an unhinged candidate who doesn't know when to shut up. This <em>is</em> the Republican party platform. </p> <p>And despite being initially criticized by his party for voicing a position on abortion and rape that gels almost perfectly with the party's official stance, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/republicans-support-todd-akin-legitimate-rape-comment-missouri/story?id=17332911#.UGXUyhhy8tw\">Akin appears to be back in the GOP's good graces</a>. He's officially on the ballot as the Republican candidate, and enjoys the practical and financial support of the national Republican senatorial committee. He's been endorsed by Rick Santorum, Rick Perry and Jim DeMint. Former House speaker Newt Gingrich is campaigning with him. The Missouri Republican party issued a statement saying it \"stands behind\" Akin. </p> <p>With GOP support, Akin is faring surprisingly well in the polls. McCaskill is now tasked with showing voters that Akin's views are far outside of the mainstream \u2013 an unladylike endeavor at which I hope she succeeds. It would be awfully nice to see a lady take on an intensely sexist, rightwing Republican and shut that whole thing down.</p>",
  "<p>The rightwing columnist Charles Krauthammer complains about Mitt Romney's unwillingness to go big, to go for the larger argument. \"For six months, he's been matching Obama small ball for small ball,\" Krauthammer writes in the Washington Post. \"A hit-and-run critique here, a slogan-of-the-week there\".</p> <p>No one could say the same thing of Ed Miliband. From responsible capitalism, to the squeezed middle, to moral markets, to developing an economy that works for working people, he has \"gone large\", super-size-me large. As his policy chief, Jon Cruddas, puts it, he has shown \"a capacity to shift the tempo of the mainstream conversation\".</p> <p>The Labour conference, constructed around the theme of Rebuilding Britain, is to be addressed by the American political philosopher Michael Sandel, Lord Coe, the boxer Nicola Adams, service personnel and nurses. It will be a chance for Labour to show its appreciation for the way he has taken the party to a 10-point lead in the latest Guardian ICM poll.</p> <p>The fact that the Conservatives have also chosen this weekend to issue their own polling, showing the party elected the wrong Miliband in terms of national popularity, will only ensure the leader is enveloped in a protective embrace by the party faithful. At a personal level, Miliband has shown a resilience and a genuinely inclusive style.</p> <p>Still, though, it is a tough ask. This will be his third speech as party leader, and he has two more before the election. Politics is an unforgiving business, and the doubts expressed about Miliband in the polls indicate that somewhere between small ball and big picture, Labour has been missing something \u2013 a means of translating its abstractions from the seminar room to the living room.</p> <p>Labour's previous policy review, essentially closed by Miliband this year, became unwieldy, owing to political deadlock and sheer chaos. Policy sub-committees mushroomed. \"There was even one on loneliness \u2013 the group never met\", says one official. The apparent stasis has frustrated some in the party. Neal Lawson, chairman of the pressure group Compass, lamented this week he had never known a runup to a Labour conference \"so lame, so uninspiring, so flat and lacking in energy and vitality\". Miliband's aides say Lawson is \"permanently disappointed\".</p> <p>There is also a host of new ideas in the ether \u2013 a \"blue Labour\" approach to public services that would see far greater decentralisation, a pluralist call by John Denham not to lose sight of the similarity in Labour and Liberal Democrat values, and a landmark piece on the scale of the deficit in Juncture, the journal of the centre-left thinktank the IPPR from Gavin Kelly, and Nick Pearce, two of Labour's best thinkers.</p> <p>But shadow cabinet members say that with the economy in flux and the election two years away, the Manchester conference, whatever the demands of the media, is not the time to start offering a manifesto or a mini-budget. But they do promise announcements on pensions, energy and housing to flesh out the theme of responsible capitalism. The key task is to establish Miliband as the agent of change, a change that a disillusioned public thought they were getting with Cameron.</p> <p>The leader's office claims to be unfazed by the Conservative efforts to make his alleged personal weakness and/or weirdness the party's achilles heel. They claim that in the YouGov polls since January Miliband's net approval rating has risen 24 points, even though it is negative overall, while Cameron's has fallen 21.</p> <p>They also claim that it is unsurprising Miliband trails on being prime ministerial. A Miliband official said: \"Prime ministers tend to look more prime ministerial. Gordon Brown two years out from the election led Cameron as more prime ministerial by 24% and on strength by 36%, and we know how that movie ended.\"</p> <p>Miliband has also made it an article of faith that he will not define himself by attacking his own party, even though that would have been one of his best routes to convincing the electorate of his robustness. For instance a plan last year to stage a party referendum on union strength in the party was ditched. Miliband prefers to pick his fights with big business predators, not union barons.</p> <p>David Cameron is also convinced that the electorate will recoil from handing Labour back the keys to the economy. Miliband has failed to convince the electorate he has learnt the lessons of the deficit. An early apology of the kind planned by his brother David was rejected because he does not think Labour was too lenient on the deficit, but on markets, and equality.</p> <p>Private efforts have been made to improve parts of his persona, the way he looks and sits down, but the settled view is that the image makers must now let him be. Yes, re-explain he went to state school, and why his family gives him irreducible values, but don't mess with his authenticity. Miliband himself says: \"If spin doctors designed a politician, they wouldn't design me\", and for better or worse that is how it will remain.</p>",
  "<p>It turns out that political Siberia, in the Republican party, isn't so far away after all \u2013 and you don't have to stay there all that long. It's more a sort of political Canada.</p> <p>One month after banning Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin from their national convention, Republican leaders are welcoming him back into the fold, his trespasses forgiven, if awkwardly unforgotten. Led by RNC chair Reince Priebus, whose stoical about-face on the issue has been worthy of the royal guard, members of the GOP top brass are gradually stepping forward, one by one, to say that the interests of the nation are now such that it is important to elect Todd Akin to the Senate, all the bad and rather unfortunate things that were said about the man last month notwithstanding.</p> <p>At the time, Republicans were deeply offended at their candidate's \"insulting, inexcusable, and, frankly, wrong\" \u2013 in the words of Mitt Romney \u2013 statement that \"legitimate rape\" does not entail a procreation risk because \"the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.\" At the time, the list of elected GOP officials, strategists and pundits condemning Akin was worthy of the government printing office.

  "<p>Mitt Romney's collapsing campaign is beginning to hurt Republican chances in key congressional races, risking their hopes of taking the Senate as a bastion against a second-term Barack Obama presidency.</p> <p>More and more Republican congressional candidates are distancing themselves from their party's White House ticket as they are hit by ads from their Democratic opponents linking them to Romney and his running mate, Paul Ryan.</p> <p>With Romney still reeling from one bad poll after another in swing states, the Obama campaign opened up a new front on Friday, sending vice-president Joe Biden on a two-day visit to Florida to warn the elderly that a Romney-Ryan victory would mean new taxes on their social security benefits.</p> <p>Biden, in excerpts from his speech released in advance, said: \"Right now, the majority of seniors don't have to pay taxes on their social security benefits \u2026 But if governor Romney's tax plan goes into effect, it could mean everyone, everyone, would have to pay more taxes on the social security benefits they now receive.\"</p> <p>Creating fear among the elderly is a potent message not only in Florida, a state with a high proportion of retirees, but in other swing states. A new poll, by the Washington Post and the health group the Kaiser Foundation, by Ryan to reform Medicare, the healthcare programme for those 65 and over, has alienated potential Republican voters..</p> <p>The poll found that in three battlegrounds \u2013 Florida, Ohio and Virginia \u2013 the changes to Medicare proposed by Ryan have tilted the elderly towards Obama. The issue ranked with them as high as the state of the economy.</p> <p>Sixty-five percent of those polled in Florida want to keep Medicare as it is. In Ohio, Obama held a 19% advantage over Romney among voters asked who they trusted most with the health programme, 15% in Florida and 13% in Virginia.</p> <p>Romney's lacklustre campaign, compounded by the threat to social security and Medicare coming on top of last week's secret video of a Romney speech, appears to be pulling down Republicans in congressional races. Candidates can usually count on receiving a boost in their districts and states from a successful presidential campaign. </p> <p>Stu Rothenberg, editor of the Rothenberg Political Report, <a href=\"http://washingtonexaminer.com/romneys-drop-weakens-gop-effort-to-take-senate/article/2508803#.UGXcBbunv38\">told the Washington Examiner</a>: \"Republicans still have a chance, but it's not what it was six months ago or a year ago. And if you had to weigh the two parties' chances, you would have to say the Democrats have a better chance of holding the Senate.\" </p> <p>The Republicans hold the House and had high hopes of adding the Senate too. With control of Congress, they would be able to throw up a formidable barrier to Obama implementing new domestic policies.</p> <p>The Democrats hold only a four-seat majority in the Senate and had looked vulnerable. But the disarray in the Romney campaign has thrown those hopes into doubt. The Democrats are threatening to win seats the Republicans had been expected to win easily, such as Virginia. The Democratic candidate in Virginia, Tim Kaine, is up 3% on his Republican opponent, George Allen.</p> <p>The one remaining opportunity for Romney to turn the presidential campaign round is the first presidential debate on Wednesday in Denver, Colorado. Tens of millions are expected to tune in for the first opportunity to see Obama and Romney one-to-one in a debate in which issues such as tax, health care and the secret video of Romney disparaging 47% of the population as freeloaders are all likely to figure. </p> <p>Debates usually end in draws that are quickly forgotten, as in 2008, but they can make a difference, as in the classic one between Kennedy and Nixon in 1960 and more recently George W Bush and Al Gore in 2000, in which Gore annoyed lots of voters by rolling his eyes while Bush was speaking.</p> <p>Both the Obama and Romney campaigns on Friday talked up expectations for their opponents while downplaying their own candidate's chances. The Obama campaign adviser David Axelrod predicted Mitt Romney would be a \"prepared, disciplined and aggressive debater\". </p> <p>Fears that the White House may be beyond the Republican party this year has already seen fighting start among conservative commentators. </p> <p>The conservative commentator Charles Krauthammer, rounded on Romney, saying he had \"fumbled\" the opportunity offered by the Middle East crisis. </p> <p>He argued that it is not too late for Romney. \"Make the case. Go large. About a foreign policy in ruins. About an archaic, 20th century welfare state model that guarantees 21st century insolvency. And about an alternate vision of an unapologetically assertive America abroad unafraid of fundamental structural change at home. It might just work. And it's not too late,\" Krauthammer wrote in the Washington Post.</p> <p>Jennifer Duffy, who covers the Senate races for the independent Cook Political Report, which had leaned a year ago to the Republicans taking the Senate, now argues that the range of possible outcomes goes from the Republicans picking up two or three seats \u2013 not enough for a majority \u2013 to actually losing a seat or two.</p> <p>Charlie Cook, <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/columns/cook-report/the-cook-report-shades-of-1996-20120927\">writing in the National Journal</a>, said that if Romney does not pick up in the polls in the next week to 10 days, he faces \"the very real prospect that Republican donors, Super Pacs and other parts of the GOP support structure will begin to shift resources away from helping him and toward a last-ditch effort to win a Senate majority \u2013 which once seemed very likely \u2013 and to protect the party's House majority.\"</p>",
  "<p>Those of us hoping that the National Football League's lockout of its regular referees would end in a victory for the regular refs got our wish. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/27/nfl-fans-relieved-referee-lockout?intcmp=239\">The lockout, which began in June, ended with the refs in good financial shape</a>, and along the way such anti-union, Republican stalwarts as Wisconsin Representative Paul Ryan came close to siding with the refs. \"It is time to get the real refs,\" Ryan told a Cincinnati town-hall audience. </p> <p>The regular refs now have an eight-year contract that will raise their average salary from $149,000 a year to $205,000 by 2019. The refs' defined pension plan (the key issue in the lockout) will remain in place for current officials through the 2016 season (or until an official earns 20 years of service), and when the NFL's defined contribution plan kicks in the annual league payment will begin at $18,000 and increase to more than $23,000 in 2019.</p> <p>The biggest downside of the agreement is that new refs will not get the defined benefit plan the veteran refs will have until 2016. A two-tier benefit system has been locked in place.</p> <p>However, if you were pulling for the regular refs, as I was, what is most worrying is why the lockout ended. The settlement did not come because fans or players threatened to boycott NFL games; nor did the settlement arise from a brilliant organizing strategy by the regular refs. The settlement came about because the replacement refs \u2013 whom nobody seemed to want to call scabs \u2013 proved to be such clowns.</p> <p>The replacement refs made Ray Anderson, the league's executive vice president for football operations, look silly when he declared: \"You've never paid for an NFL ticket to watch somebody officiate a game.\" </p> <p>The turning point in the lockout came on a nationally televised, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/25/seattle-seahawks-green-bay-packers-replacement-officials\">Monday-night game between the Green Bay Packers and Seattle Seahawks</a>. On the final play of the game, a crew of replacements refs ruled a pass that Green Bay defensive back MD Jennings intercepted was a Seattle touchdown when Seattle receiver Golden Tate grabbed part of the ball after Jennings hit the ground with it.</p> <p>Fans watching the game were outraged, and soon the blown call was being shown over and over on television newscasts and sports programs around the country. <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/63966/aaron-rodgers-game-is-being-tarnished\">In a Tuesday ESPN radio interview</a>, Green Bay's star quarterback, Aaron Rodgers, complained: \"The game is being tarnished by an NFL who obviously cares more about saving some money than having the integrity of the game diminished.\"</p> <p>In the normally anti-labor Wall Street Journal, Minnesota's Hall of Fame quarterback Fran Tarkenton joined Rodgers in complaining about the officiating. \"We hit a new low in this week's Monday Night Football,\" Tarkenton wrote in an op-ed punningly titled <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444180004578018460285661282.html\">\"Pro Football Keeps Fumbling\"</a>.</p> <p>The larger political problem for those of us who supported regular refs is the unreliability of such turning points. Mitt Romney, with his dismissive remarks about the 47% of Americans who won't vote for him because they are government dependents, is living proof that the right in America is having trouble keeping its arrogance in check.</p> <p>Romney at least appears to be trying to back off his 47% remarks. The same cannot be said for those who run the NFL. The league's owners show no sign of believing they made a mistake in asking the refs to give up a pension plan that barely made a dent in the annual $9.3bn industry that is NFL football.</p> <p>The same clique who for years denied that repeated concussions were causing many of their players lifetime brain damage (the Alzheimer's rate among NFL players with five or more seasons is four times the national average) persist in thinking of pro football and its personnel as little more than a \"product\". </p> <p><em>Nicolaus Mills is professor of American studies at Sarah Lawrence College.

  "<p>In case you haven't noticed, there's a big problem in the GOP. If the primaries didn't establish this (see Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, et al), then Mitt <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57517589-503544/noonan-romney-campaign-is-a-rolling-calamity/\">Romney's so-called \"rolling calamity\"</a> of a general election campaign certainly has. In the midst of an incredibly important election to determine the future of America, the Republican party is in the throes of an identity crisis.</p> <p>To be sure, Romney is an imperfect messenger. But he's not entirely to blame for this inability to articulate a sufficiently compelling narrative beyond the \"Not-Obama\" position.&#xa0;In many ways, he's a victim of the times. The Republican party has spent years suffering from unaddressed, systemic problems.</p> <p>It boils down to a lack of leadership, vision and unity. This is, of course, interrelated: visionary leaders use rhetoric to inspire unity, and a party or movement that lacks visionary leaders will quickly spiral out of control \u2013 into a negative cycle of infighting, score-settling and petty vindictiveness. As <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/ryan-were-going-to-beat-him-il6vfi7-170909701.html\">Paul Ryan lamented earlier this week to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I think that's just the nature of conservative punditry is to do that \u2014 to kind of complain \u2014 about any imperfection they might see.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Perhaps indicative of this remark, <a href=\"http://www.rightwingnews.com/conservatives/matt-lewis-on-the-sell-out-punditry-of-david-frum-and-michelle-malkin/\">Michelle Malkin and David Frum recently engaged</a> in precisely the kind of feud characteristic of a movement that is very unhappy about its position and looking for someone to blame. Conservative&#xa0;commentary today is essentially bifurcated between the red meat-hurling carnival barkers who pander to the base and the mainstream media quislings who cater to the Georgetown cocktail circuit and the cable TV bookers looking to book a \"token\" conservative to fill out their Sunday morning panel.</p> <p><a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2012/09/23/no-apology/\">As I recently noted in a Daily Caller column</a>, both sides are destructive in their own ways. The quislings undermine our Republican candidates today by criticizing them, while the demagogues ensure the long-term structural changes aren't addressed. Just try to talk about comprehensive immigration reform as a Republican and see how long you last.</p> <p>But to blame Republican opinion-formers for not being positive enough about the party they inhabit is surely a case of shooting the messenger. Robust debate can be a sign of intellectual self-confidence, but this sort of divisiveness between conservative pundits is symptomatic a larger crisis of identity and ideas. It's time for Republicans to ask the big questions that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKpX-5jQjQ0\">Admiral Stockdale made famous</a> in that debate so many years ago:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Who are we \u2013 and why are we here?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The GOP is running on fumes. Like a copy of a copy of a tape, conservatives have been living off the legacy of Ronald Reagan for decades.</p> <p>The cold war was the glue that united the conservative movement. Each leg of the stool \u2013 social conservatives, fiscal conservatives and national security conservatives \u2013 had their own reasons for uniting to defeat the Communists. Reagan benefitted from this unity, as well as from his own ability to inspire, and knew how to play it.</p> <p>But George W Bush managed to put the final nail in the coffin of the decades-long \"Reagan era\", and so it's time to start anew. Bush invented a new Republican brand, but then ensured it couldn't be used again.</p> <p>The \"compassionate conservatism\" that helped get him elected in 2000 ended up being overlooked by an administration distracted by the neoconservative overreach of two foreign wars, combined with increased spending that blew out the deficit and helped create an economic crisis for which many voters still blame President Bush, rather than President Obama. </p> <p>Today's GOP is in need of serious&#xa0;intellectual renewal.&#xa0;For one thing, it's mostly the fiscal leg that supports the three-legged stool these days. The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/25/opinion/brooks-the-conservative-mind.html\">New York Times's&#xa0;David Brooks makes a good point</a> about the GOP's current focus on economic issues:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The Republican party has abandoned half of its intellectual ammunition. It appeals to people as potential business owners, but not as parents, neighbors and citizens.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>And this lack of inclusiveness underpins a lot of the Obama campaign's success in tagging Romney as a private equity guy who's only going to look after the prosperity of the super-rich elite. It's been hard for out-of-work \"Reagan Democrats\" in places like Ohio to identify with Mitt Romney.</p> <p>This is not to say economics can be ignored, but Republicans have to articulate the <em>moral case</em> for free markets. It can't be framed negatively, as necessary \"austerity\", or explained in purely wonkish terms. Too often that happens. As one GOP official, giving advice to Mitt Romney, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/26/politics/romney-ohio/index.html\">recently told CNN.com</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Don't make your campaign about marginal tax rates. Make it about your children and your grandchildren and the future of this country.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Some of this is messaging. But there are other not-obviously-ideological ideas that could. </p> <p>Why not support an e-Congress that would allow members of Congress to vote electronically from their districts? Republicans could carry the torch of putting a man on Mars by 2019. And pledge to pass legislation to make eradication of cancer the nation's top national health priority.&#xa0;Or how about championing the kind of education reform that we've seen in films like \"Waiting for Superman\" and \"Won't Back Down\"?</p> <p>Whether it's finding a way to fix education, deal compassionately with immigrants, or other bold and visionary conservative ideas, America can once again be that \"shining city on a hill\" Reagan famously spoke of. It's time for Republicans to once again be the party of the future \u2013 and of the middle class.</p> <p>But vision is not just about policy; it's time for conservatives to rediscover poetry. My guess is that one of the reasons speechwriters like Peggy Noonan have been so critical of Mitt Romney's campaign is that it has lacked any romance or poetry.</p> <p>Conservatives must have a leader who can inspire and can be afforded the luxury of introducing new, unorthodox ideas. In this regard, I'm partial to Senator Marco Rubio, who can eloquently talk about the American Dream, and we have a fresh crop of inspirational possible future leaders: besides Rubio, Representative Mike Pence (a gubernatorial candidate in Indiana) and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, to name but three.</p> <p>But leaders come and go, and leaders will be found. First, conservatives need to rediscover why it is they want to govern in the first place.</p>",
  "<p>I'm currently traveling around the US on a speaking tour, and as I've <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/04/16/personalizing_civil_liberties_abuses/\">written before</a>, one of the prime benefits of doing that is being able to meet people and their families whose lives have been severely harmed by the post-9/11 assault on basic liberties. Doing that prevents one from regarding these injustices as abstractions, and ensures that the very real human costs from these government abuses remain vivid.</p> <p>Such is the case with the treatment of Dr. Shakir Hamoodi, an Iraqi-American nuclear engineer who just began a three-year prison sentence at the Fort Leavenworth, Kansas penitentiary for the \"crime\" of sending sustenance money to his impoverished, sick, and suffering relatives in Iraq - including his blind mother - during the years when US sanctions (which is what caused his family's suffering) barred the sending of any money to Iraq. </p> <p>Yesterday in Columbia, Missouri, I met with Hamoodi's son, Owais, a medical student at the University of Missouri (MU) School of Medicine, and Hamoodi's son-in-law, Amir Yehia, a Master's student in MU's School of Journalism. The travesty of this case - and the havoc it has wreaked on the entire family - is repellent and genuinely infuriating. But it is sadly common in post-9/11 America, especially for American Muslim communities.</p> <p>Hamoodi came with his wife to the US in 1985 to work toward his PhD in nuclear engineering from MU and, not wanting to return to the oppression of Saddam's regime, stayed in the US. He was offered a research professor position at the university, proceeded to have five American-born children, all of whom he and his wife raised in the Columbia community, and then himself became a US citizen in 2002. </p> <p>But US-imposed sanctions after the First Gulf War had decimated the value of Iraqi currency and were causing extreme hardship for his large family who remained in Iraq. That sanctions regime caused the death of <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/iraq/sanctions.html\">at least hundreds of thousands of Iraqis</a>, including <a href=\"http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1084\">500,000 Iraqi children</a>. In 1991, the writer Chuck Sudetic visited Iraq, <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2001/11/betrayal-basra\">wrote in Mother Jones</a> about the pervasive suffering, starvation and mass death he witnessed first-hand, and noted that the US-led sanctions regime \"killed more civilians than all the chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons used in human history\".</p> <p>The sanctions regime decimated Hamoodi's family. His elderly blind mother was unable to buy basic medication. His sister, one of 11 siblings back in Iraq, suffered a miscarriage because she was unable to buy $10 antibiotics. His brother, a surgeon, was earning the equivalent of $2 per month and literally unable to feed his family.</p> <p>Hamoodi was earning a very modest salary at the time of roughly $35,000 per year from the university, but - as would be true for any decent person of conscience - could not ignore the extreme and growing suffering of his family back in Iraq. Because sending money into Iraq from the US was physically impossible, he set up a bank account in Jordan and proceeded to make small deposits into it. From that account, small amounts of money - between $20 and $100 - were dispersed each month to his family members.</p> <p>When other Iraqi nationals in his Missouri community heard of his helping his family, they wanted to help theirs as well. So Hamoodi began accepting similar amounts of money from a small group of Iraqis and ensured those were disbursed to their family members suffering under the sanctions regime. From 1993 until 2003, when the sanctions regime was lifted after the US invasion, Hamoodi sent an average of $25,000 each year back to Iraq, totaling roughly $250,000 over the decade: an amount that fed and sustained the Iraqi relatives of 14 families in Columbia, Missouri, including his wife's five siblings.</p> <p>Nobody, including the US government, claims that these amounts were intended for anything other than humanitarian assistance for his family and those of others in his community. Everyone, including the US government, acknowledges that these funds were sent to and received only by the intended recipients - suffering Iraqi family members - and never got anywhere near Saddam's regime, terrorist groups, or anything illicit. As a <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/06/18/iraq-war-sanctions-run-amok-shakir-hamoodi-s-story.html\">Newsweek article on the Hamoodi case</a> made clear:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The cash . . . was doled out mostly in dribs and drabs, even the authorities concede; $40 a month to the son of a friend trying to eat while attending medical school, $80 to Hamoodi's blind mother. There was no suggestion that Hamoodi . . . aided terrorists, or that the money wound up in Saddam Hussein's hands; his elaborate email trail served as receipts, as tidy as his bookkeeping at the store.</p> <p>\"'I would get messages from my sisters, I have 11 siblings,' he says, as he shares a somber meal - piquant red peppers from South Africa, French cheeses, crusty baklava - with his wife and sons at the long dining room table. 'They would be starving. Starving. So I did what anyone, any American, would do.'\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br>But in 2002 and 2003, Hamoodi was not just a nuclear engineer. He was also a very outspoken critic of the Bush administration's plan to attack Iraq. And his position as a nuclear engineer made him a particularly potent threat to the case for that invasion, as he continuously insisted that Saddam did not have an active nuclear weapons program and that the case for the war was grounded in lies. In his antiwar activism, he emphasized how much already-suffering Iraqi civilians would suffer more, and how the invasion would lead to mass instability.</p> <p>On 18 September 2006, two of Hamoodi's children, Owais, then 17, and his college-aged sister Lamees, were at home when there was a knock on the door. Owais answered and saw two FBI agents who stood there, and behind them were 35 armed federal agents, many with guns drawn, from ten different federal law enforcement agencies. They told him they had a search warrant to search their home and then entered.</p> <p>\"We wanted to stay and watch what they did, but they told us we had to leave because they claimed they had nobody to keep an eye on us\", Owais told me, noting again that 35 agents were present. The agents spent 9 hours in Hamoodi's home alone and unsupervised. They took every passport they found, all identification (including the learner's permit of Owais' 15-year-old brother, who was left without any identification), family heirlooms, photo albums, and boxes of documents. They even insisted that Owais give them his calculator that he used for algebra class on the ground that it had memory potential. To date - six years later - the family has received none of those materials back.</p> <p>The massive, flamboyant FBI raid on Hamoodi's home predictably generated <a href=\"http://archive.columbiatribune.com/2006/sep/20060918news003.asp\">substantial media coverage in his community</a>. \"FBI agents today searched the home of a Columbia businessman and former Iraqi who has been an outspoken critic of the war in Iraq,\" read the first line of a long article in the local Columbia Daily Tribune. \"People of course automatically assumed terrorism\", said Owais.</p> <p>Several years later, Hamoodi was finally indicted and for the first time learned of his \"crime\": that, as <a href=\"http://www.insidecolumbia.net/August-2012/The-Complicated-Case-Of-Shakir-Hamoodi/index.php?cparticle=1&amp;siarticle=0#artanc\">this excellent Inside Columbia article</a> on his case put it, he \"ran afoul of a couple of Gulf War-era executive orders, an act of Congress and Treasury Department regulations\" banning the sending of any money to Iraq.</p> <p>From the start, Hamoodi fully cooperated with federal investigators. He readily admitted that he had sent the money to Iraq to help his starving family and those of other families in Columbia. Calling it a \"crime of compassion\", he pled guilty to the charge of engaging in \"a conspiracy to violate the International Economic Emergency Powers Act\".</p> <p>Owais says his father's guilty plea was accompanied by the near certainty that he would receive no jail time. \"There were like five other cases involving much greater amounts sent to Iraq, some with accusations that the money had reached the regime, and very light sentences were given, including by the same judge in my father's case, who had just given another Iraqi national probation for having sent more money than my father.\" Moreover, delays in the proceedings meant that the sentencing hearing was not going to occur until the Summer of 2012 -- nine years after the sanctions expired, and nine years after Hamoodi had sent his last payment back to Iraq. </p> <p>But on 16 May 2012, Hamoodi stood before US District Judge Nanette Laughrey, a Clinton appointee, as she sentenced him to three years in a federal penitentiary - only two years less than the maximum sentence under federal sentencing guidelines for this offense - followed by three years probation. Hamoodi's son-in-law, Amir Yehia, was at both his father-in-law's sentencing hearing and the one of another Iraqi national who had received probation from Judge Laughrey just four months earlier for a similar offense. \"This time, it was like she was a totally different person,\" he told me. \"I don't know if she was pressured or had received pushback after the probation she gave in the other case, but it was amazing how completely different she was at his hearing.\"</p> <p>In a country that has stood by while torturers, government kidnappers, and Wall Street thieves have been completely protected - to say nothing of those who aggressively attacked Iraq - Judge Laughrey, as recounted by Inside Columbia, invoked the mandates of the \"rule of law\" to explain why Hamoodi, now 60, would have to spend the next three years in a federal prison despite having harmed absolutely nobody:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"'He obviously has a model family, a lovely family, lovely children . . . I am sure it is largely as a result of your leadership in the family,' [the judge] told [Hamoodi]. 'But I have also had to take into account what you did . . . you disagreed with the law, and you decided not to comply with the law. That does not show respect for the rule of law, which is the foundation of this country.'\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The lawyer from the Obama justice department - the same agency that shielded all Bush-era criminals from even an iota of accountability on the ground that we must \"Look Forward, not Backward\" - invoked the same rationale for why Hamoodi must be punished for the payments he sent to his suffering family nine years ago:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"'It's easy to say it's all in the rearview mirror, the sanctions have expired[', said Garrett M. Heenan]. 'But it is still a serious crime, and the larger United States government interests in having sanctions and, moreover, having people in the United States - citizens - abide by the requirements of [the] Treasury [Department] and not violate those sanctions is an important thing that the United States would seek to promote.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>As of three weeks ago - beginning on 28 August - Hamoodi is now at Fort Leavenworth, where he just began serving his three year sentence. Yehia, his son-in-law, says that he is holding up reasonably well but is extremely worried about how his family will manage. Owais says that he's most concerned about his youngest brother, now in the tenth grade: \"That's a really vulnerable time for a kid, and now he has to live it with his father gone, in prison.\"</p> <p>As harrowing as this is, these stories are incredibly common in American Muslim communities. But what makes this case particularly horrific is that the suffering Hamoodi sought to alleviate was caused by the very same US government that is now imprisoning him for his humanitarianism. </p> <p>The reason his relatives were starving and living in abject misery was precisely because the US government enforced years of brutal sanctions. To have that same government then turn around and punish him for the \"crime\" of helping his family members survive is warped sadism. I really don't see how prosecutors and judges who participate in these sorts of travesties can live with themselves. Worse, US officials who twice completely destroyed Iraq - first with the sanctions regime, then with an aggressive war - are permitted to thrive in freedom and enrich themselves. As one local activist, Jeff Stack, <a href=\"http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/2012/aug/19/may-the-truth-set-hamoodi-free/\">wrote after Hamoodi received his shocking sentence</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>\"Who will truly be served by incarcerating our friend Shakir Hamoodi? Certainly not his wife and their five children, who collectively exemplify what is most hopeful and encouraging about this nation. They are hard-working and high-achieving contributing citizens. Three of their children have completed undergraduate degrees. Two of them finished master's programs and one is attending medical school. The youngest two are in college and high school.</p> <p>\"Society won't benefit by his costly imprisonment, which will leave a painful void in our community. He poses no threat. . . . The [Newsweek] article notes Justice Department officials provided the reporter a list of seven individuals who have been incarcerated for violating sanctions. The 59-year-old Columbia resident stands out as the only one facing prison for undertaking purely humanitarian actions and taking nothing for himself.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Hamoodi's family has now placed all of their hopes in trying to persude President Obama, or whoever is in the Oval Office after the election, to pardon him or at least commute his sentence. A petition has been created and currently has over 3,000 signatures; you can and, I hope will, <a href=\"http://www.change.org/petitions/president-barack-obama-commute-the-36-month-sentence-of-dr-shakir-hamoodi\">add your name here</a>. You can also donate to help his family <a href=\"http://www.helphamoodi.org/donate.html\">on this page</a>.</p> <p>The 9/11 attack was exploited to create what New York Times Editorial Page Editor Andrew Rosenthal has <a href=\"http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/30/liberty-and-justice-for-non-muslims/\">accurately described</a> as \"a separate justice system for Muslims\". These are the kinds of horrific injustices which that separate - and decidedly not equal - system routinely creates.</p> <h2>Speaking tour</h2> <p>The event in which I participated last night at the University of Missouri Law School on America's civil liberties abuses was truly excellent.

  "<p>My organisation, founded by Catholic sisters 40 years ago, lobbies the US Congress for economic justice with a strongly progressive faith voice. This year, motivated by a disturbing proposal for a new national budget, we decided to try something new for us \u2013 a <a href=\"http://nunsonthebus.com/\" title=\"\">2,700-mile bus tour through nine states</a> that would connect us directly with people who would suffer if the budget were approved.</p> <p>Catholic sisters work daily with people who live at the economic margins. We planned to stand with our sisters and the people they serve, to hear their stories, and to bring their voices back to Washington. We felt we must do this as our response to calls of the gospel and Catholic social teaching to actively challenge injustice wherever we find it.</p> <p>The budget proposal we opposed was authored by House of Representatives budget chairman Paul Ryan. The so-called \"Ryan budget\" would slash funding for programmes that serve people in need while giving bigger tax breaks to the wealthy. He had the backing of fellow Republicans, who hold the majority in the House. His budget was also endorsed by presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who in August named Ryan as his vice-presidential running mate. For two years, we had lobbied Congress to oppose such budget cuts, and we also encouraged thousands of our members to contact their elected officials to voice their opposition. It was time to go out on the road to amplify our collective voices.</p> <p>Particularly appalling to us as Catholic sisters, Ryan announced that the values in his budget proposal reflected those of his Catholic faith. This is emphatically not true, and the US Conference of Catholic Bishops wrote a series of letters stating that programmes that help people in poverty must be protected.</p> <p>On June 17, we \"nuns on the bus\" began our journey in Iowa. We met with people at the economic margins and those who served them, and also visited congressional district offices to talk about how the Ryan budget would harm our nation. What astonished us were the crowds of people who met us throughout our trip. Thousands of people who clearly hungered for a stronger church voice in behalf of social justice \u2013 and a US Congress that would move past partisan bickering to a genuine concern for those in need.</p> <p>We will never forget the crowds and congressional visits, but our visits with the people left the deepest, most lasting impressions.</p> <p>In Iowa, we listened as Tia talked about how her stay at <a href=\"http://www.openingdoorsdbq.org/\" title=\"\">Maria House</a> had enabled her to complete high school so her family could move into their own apartment. There are those who would cut education funding even though we know that education is key to lifting people out of poverty and helping them become self-sufficient.</p> <p>In Ohio, we met Jini, who had just attended her sister's funeral. Margaret died because she lost her health insurance when she lost her job. When she developed cancer she had no access to diagnosis or treatment. When fully implemented, President Obama's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act\" title=\"\">Affordable Care Act</a> will cover people like Margaret and provide access to healthcare for millions more. Congressional Republicans have tried repeatedly to repeal what they call \"Obamacare\" and to eliminate funding for its implementation. That is wrong.</p> <p>At a Virginia farm, we met a little boy who walked with one of our sisters into a blackberry patch, where he presented her with a sweet berry. As she wrote afterwards: \"Amazingly, the youngster did not take the first taste of the fruit of his labour. Nor did he try to fill his own belly or pockets in order to save some for a later date. No, Eden was generous and he trusted that there would be enough for all of us.\"</p> <p>During our journey, I realised that the Ryan budget has at its heart a lie. Unlike little Eden, who knows the truth, the budget proposal says that our nation is rooted in individualism, selfishness and fear. We are \u2013 and must be \u2013 a compassionate people. As I said recently to the Democratic National Convention, \"I AM my sister's keeper. I AM my brother's keeper.\" My faith and love of this country tell me this is the truth. This truth also reflects the best of our constitution. I trust that future faith statements like that of \"nuns on the bus\" will convince all our elected officials as well.</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron has confirmed that the British people will be given a say, possibly in a referendum, on any new EU settlement after the next general election.</p> <p>Speaking on the final day of his visit to the US and Brazil, the prime minister also announced that Britain would opt out of a series of EU law and order policies later this year.</p> <p>Cameron said that major changes to the EU would require \"fresh consent\" from the British people. But he stopped short of specifically mentioning a referendum because the timing of a new EU agreement could mean that it would make more sense to seek the consent of voters in a general election. The prime minister, who will set out his thinking in the autumn, believes a referendum is the most likely outcome after a new EU settlement is agreed in the wake of the eurozone crisis.</p> <p>In a sign of a more immediate hardline approach, he said Britain would exercise its rights to stand apart from a series of justice and home affairs measures later this year.</p> <p>Asked by the BBC whether Britain would opt out of EU justice and policing powers, he said: \"That has to be done before the end of the year, and the opt-out is there. We'll be exercising that opt-out.</p> <p>\"The key thing then is, well, which of the array of things you've come out of do you actually think are good for Britain and you want to co-operate with European partners on? And that's a discussion we're having at the moment.\"</p> <p>The prime minister said voters would be consulted once a new EU settlement had been agreed.</p> <p>He told Sky News in Rio de Janeiro: \"When we achieve that new settlement I think we will be able to seek fresh consent from the British people. I will be setting that out in the autumn before the end of the year.</p> <p>\"I think that is the way the country wants to go and that is the way we should go, safeguarding Britain's interests. A new settlement and a fresh consent from the British people, that is what I believe we need.\"</p> <p>Cameron, who faces intense political pressure from the UK Independence party in the runup to the 2014 European parliamentary elections, believes voters will need to be consulted if the EU agrees a major treaty revision in the next few years. Eurozone leaders are expected to agree wide-ranging changes to the governance of the single currency, possibly by moving towards a fiscal union, to avoid a repeat of the euro crisis.</p> <p>Britain will not be part of the arrangements. But the changes will have to be agreed by all 27 EU members in a new treaty or in a revision to the Lisbon treaty.</p> <p>The prime minister would use the treaty negotiations, in which Britain would have a veto, to recast the country's relationship with the EU by repatriating powers. It is expected he would ask for the contents of the chapter on social and employment laws, which is sprinkled in various places of the Lisbon treaty, to be repatriated.</p> <p>Cameron said: \"I don't think it is in Britain's interests to leave the EU, but I do think what it is increasingly becoming the time for is a new settlement between Britain and Europe, and I think that new settlement will require fresh consent. In the next parliament, I think there will be opportunities for a fresh settlement and for new consent to that settlement.</p> <p>\"The fact is Europe is changing \u2013 and changing rapidly. The eurozone of 17 countries with one currency, I believe that one day they are going to move towards one economic policy. We are not going to be part of that and I think that will provide over time opportunities for a new settlement between Britain and Europe.\"</p> <p>Cameron's thinking was recently set out by Sir John Major who told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show the negotiations would provide Britain with a chance to recast relations with the EU. This could bring an end to what he called the long-running sore of Britain's fraught relations with the union.</p> <p>But Cameron will tread with care because Britain does not know when a major treaty revision will take place, and he does not want to undermine Britain's negotiating position by sounding too shrill about a referendum.</p> <p>Some eurozone leaders want prompt action. But Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the European commission president, has called for a slower approach. In his state of the union address recently he floated the idea of using the results of elections to the European parliament in 2014 as a way of establishing a negotiating framework.</p> <p>Britain expects a slower approach because the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, is focused on next year's federal elections. But Cameron feels he must speak out now because there will be three EU summits before Christmas covering a banking union for the bloc, the next seven-year EU budget and the eurozone crisis.</p> <p>In an interview with ITN, the prime minister confirmed for the first time that Andrew Mitchell, the chief whip, had damaged the government when he swore at police in Downing Street.</p> <p>Cameron told ITN: \"Well, look of course it's been damaging but the fact is that the chief whip has apologised, and apologised properly. And that needed to happen, and this must never ever happen again. And the police have said they're not taking it further, and on that basis I think we can let matters rest there.\"</p>",

He faces a disappointed liberal base, a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/sep/27/us-gdp-growth-estimate-revised-down\">stuttering</a> economic recovery, stubborn joblessness, a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/15/lehman-brothers-collapse_n_1885489.html\">failure</a> to reform Wall Street and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/01/world/obamas-counterterrorism-aide-defends-drone-strikes.html\">defending</a> a drones and targeted killing programme that makes Dick Cheney look like Mahatma Gandhi. It helps the Democrat cause considerably, therefore, when Mitt Romney \u2013 far from attacking Obama \u2013 decides to self-destruct instead.</p> <p>So it was with the now-notorious \"47%\" <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/secret-video-romney-private-fundraiser\">secret videotape</a> that emerged from inside a private Romney fundraiser. After all, why should the Obama team write their own attack ads when the Romney team give them the best lines free of charge?</p> <h2>What</h2> <p>Called \"My Job\", this 30-second TV spot is the third Obama ad to feature the secret video in which Romney lambasted almost half of all Americans as loafing, government-dependent \"victims\" to an audience of rich contributors.</p> <h2>When</h2> <p>It came out Thursday morning, 27 September.</p> <h2>Where</h2> <p>It will be airing in New Hampshire, Virginia, Florida, Ohio, Iowa, Nevada and Colorado. Which is a typical list of the battleground states.</p> <h2>How</h2> <p>You know you have made a big mistake when your opponent does not have to attack your words, or splice them out of context, or extract a single sentence as damning while ignoring everything else. Instead, your opponent just repeats your words right back at you. So it is with this ad. Romney's comments about how 47% of Americans are freeloaders (ignoring the fact <a href=\"http://www.alternet.org/hot-news-views/jon-stewart-fox-coverage-romney-47-video-chaos-bullsht-mountain\">many</a> are the working poor, retirees, injured veterans, students and, indeed, Republicans) were so toxic that the Obama campaign has cut an ad in which it simply plays the speech. </p> <p>This can be likened to the Saturday Night Live skits of Sarah Palin where, instead of a script, Tina Fey <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgRA8oTk8ig\">just repeated Palin's own quotes</a>. (That was enough to lampoon her as unfit to be a heartbeat away from the presidency.) This advert begins with Romney speaking:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"There are 47% of the people who will vote for the president no matter what \u2026 who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe that government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>As his stentorian voice drones on, the ad flashes up pictures of ordinary-looking Americans at home, at work or wearing their veterans' gear. They are presented in the sort of washed-out palate beloved of music video directors for tragic love songs. </p> <p>But they also look seriously annoyed. \"Do you mean me?\" they seem to be saying. But Romney goes on:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"So my job is not to worry about those people. I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Further portraits of incredulous-looking working-class Americans appear. Then, the ad fades to black. Not a single spoken word in the ad comes from anywhere but Romney's own mouth. It is astonishing, really.</p> <p>After score upon score of different political ads this electoral season, the one that really packs the most devastating punch is one that just shows Romney talking honestly and openly about his true beliefs among some of his biggest fans. And that should tell you everything you need to know about the dire state of his campaign.</p>",

It must have been tempting, as many did, to go for the AS TITCH INTIME split, but few managed to link cryptic and definition parts effectively while preserving a convincing surface reading. A number of clues submitted contained an initially mysterious reference to Dr Who, until I realized that the clue phrase contains most of the letters of Matt Smith, the actor currently playing the doctor. Given that indirect anagrams were involved, and that several actors have played the title role over the years, these were simply unacceptable as fair clues.</p> <p>I must be brief this month, to get this slip printed and despatched in reasonable time (already a week later than normal).

Earlier this month he died after a short illness, just four weeks short of his 98th birthday and survived by my mother, now 94.

  "<h2>1) Django bates confirmation/F-ire Collective festival in October</h2> <p>I can't recall an occasion when I've previously given a second successive five stars to the same artist, but it happened this month when I reviewed pianist Django Bates's new album, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/sep/13/django-bates-confirmation-review?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Confirmation</a>, following the big cheer I gave him with the same trio and a closely related repertoire in 2010 for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/mar/25/django-bates-cd-review?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Beloved Bird</a>. Both sessions celebrated the London-raised pianist's childhood hero, bebop genius Charlie Parker. After three decades of concentrating on original music with unique bands like Loose Tubes and Delightful Precipice, Bates finally felt ready to add something of his own to some of the most influential works in jazz.</p> <p>Does this mean I think Bates is better than Sonny Rollins, or Wayne Shorter, or Maria Schneider, or Brad Mehldau, or many other great jazz creators whose output I didn't give five stars to twice running in recent years? Not exactly, and probably the most useful conclusion to draw is that a star system is a pretty blunt instrument for detailing what you like or don't like about an artist. But thinking back on what felt like an impulse choice at the time, I'm sure I was awarding Django Bates maximum points for several virtues combined. First, the imaginative audacity and technical command of his piano-playing on those discs, which seemed to have hit a new roll after he passed half a century on the planet. But second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth \u2013 and the list could go on \u2013 for his independence, passion, wit, commitment, ensemble empathy and absolute faith in jazz's crucial place (as both a language and an attitude) in the evolution of contemporary music.</p> <p>Bates has been a model for creative players wanting to put their own shows on the road. London's <a href=\"http://www.f-ire.com/\" title=\"\">F-ire Collective</a>, home to Seb Rochford, Kit Downes and many other inventive UK performers, runs its annual festival at the city's PizzaExpress Jazz Club in October \u2013 and its existence came directly from F-ire founder Barak Schmool's experiences in Bates's Delightful Precipice in the 1990s. Several other new-music collectives around the UK have sprung up in its wake. Bates and an early F-ire recruit, guitarist David Okumu, <a href=\"http://arts.guardian.co.uk/fridayreview/story/0,,1404818,00.html\" title=\"\">fascinatingly discussed the issues involved in the Guardian in 2005</a>.</p> <p>And here's the man himself with Danish drummer Peter Bruun (and fellow Dane Petter Eldh on bass but out of the single-angle shot) live at Jazzdor in Strasbourg last year, playing Parker's My Little Suede Shoes.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8ba5_5cq0sg?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8ba5_5cq0sg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ba5_5cq0sg&amp;feature=related\">Reading this on mobile? Click here to watch video</a></p> <h2>2) Yuri Honing at PizzaExpress</h2> <p>Yuri Honing, the 47-year-old Dutch saxophonist, last played in London almost exactly 13 years ago, and his <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/sep/24/yuri-honing-review?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">return visit this September</a> made the long wait hard to fathom. Honing included Abba's Waterloo (\"the Swedish national anthem\") in his set back then \u2013 though as a dark and Coltrane-esque tenor-sax lament \u2013 and he still likes that approach, with Bowie's Bring Me the Disco King and Goldfrapp's Paper Bag on his new album, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/sep/13/yuri-honing-quartet-true-review\" title=\"\">True</a>. With the addition of young Dutch pianist Wolfert Brederode \u2013 to whom I profusely apologise for doggedly referring to in print as Wilfred \u2013 the group shifted on the recording to a more spacious and impressionistic approach. But recordings are recordings and live is live \u2013 very different things in jazz \u2013 and this fine band, including inventive long-time Honing drummer Joost Lijbaart, often played in a dynamically upfront, high-energy manner during the gig.</p> <p>Honing's resourcefulness and unpredictability have been nurtured by very diverse playing experiences on the experimental Dutch jazz scene over the years, from free-improv to fusion. And in the latter mode, he can rock out with the best of them \u2013 as his Wired Paradise electric band often showed in the noughties. Here it is in 2007, with the excellent guitarist Frank M\u00f6bus.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/weoROb5Svz4?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/weoROb5Svz4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weoROb5Svz4\">Reading this on mobile?

Pianist-founder Dave Stapleton provided the impetus by being an exciting bandleader himself, and the label now presents such distinctly different contemporary piano trios as Tom Cawley's Curios, Matthew Bourne in Bourne/Davis/Kane and UK legend John Taylor's Meadow with Tord Gustavsen saxist Tore Brunborg and Food's Thomas Str\u00f8nen, alongside other new groups of various shapes and sizes. Edition staged a mini-festival at London's Kings Place in mid-September, with its world-class young sax discovery from Norway <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/sep/17/marius-neset-daniel-herskedal-review\" title=\"\">Marius Neset</a> among the front-runners.</p> <p>But British pianist and composer Ivo Neame, a young man with an unerring sense of the right sound for the right setting (he's a superb sideman in other people's bands) is also one of the label's fast-evolving new recruits, and his composing is quickly catching up on the originality and inventiveness of his spontaneous playing. <a href=\"http://www.editionrecords.com/2012/07/interview-ivo-neame-prepares-for-new-release/\" title=\"\">Neame released his latest album, Yatra, this month</a> \u2013 an octet venture including saxophonists Jason Yarde and Shabaka Hutchings, and a frequent regular associate, the vibraphonist Jim Hart.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F2464429&amp;show_artwork=true\"> <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F2464429&show_artwork=true\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/editionrecords/sets/ivo-neame-yatra/\">Reading this on mobile?

But here's a birthday connection to the festival \u2013 the extraordinary Sonny Rollins's 82nd on 9 September. As he has so often been, Rollins is the London jazz festival's headline star \u2013 and with equal familiarity, his 16 November gig at the Barbican was sold out months ago. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/nov/21/sonny-rollings-bad-plus-ljf\" title=\"\">When Rollins last played the LJF, two years ago at just past 80</a>, he ripped through a straight two-hour set that had his audience gasping while the man himself, who had taken to the stage a little stooped and tentatively, seemed to shrug off the years as he went.</p> <p>Very happy 82nd, Mr Rollins. And here's one of the famous tracks that woke the world up to the arrival of a colossus \u2013 from Saxophone Colossus in 1956, of course, it's St Thomas.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UA2XIWZxMKM?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UA2XIWZxMKM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UA2XIWZxMKM&amp;list=AL94UKMTqg-9A_nmUQZgU9jT14Rwz9bOzh&amp;index=1&amp;feature=plcp\">Reading this on mobile?

For several gigs on the UK tour, she enlists the services of pianist <a href=\"http://www.gwilymsimcock.com/\" title=\"\">Gwilym Simcock</a> and classical violinist <a href=\"http://www.thomasgould.com/\" title=\"\">Thomas Gould</a>.</p>",

  "<p>The Niger government took the brave decision last year <a href=\"http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/niger-warns-of-looming-food-crisis\" title=\"\">to sound the alarm early on hunger</a> \u2013 the rainy season, from July to September, had been well below average and a drop in food production looked likely.</p> <p>One year later, the picture is very different. This time the alarm is being raised by NGOs <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/gallery/2012/aug/24/niger-floods-in-pictures\" title=\"\">to help an estimated 500,000 affected by flooding in Niger</a>. \"[It's] the last thing Niger needed,\" said Samuel Braimah, Oxfam's country director.</p> <p>Despite the flooding, the rains are welcome news for approximately 15 million people in six countries in the Sahel threatened by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/graphic/2012/mar/09/sahel-food-crisis-map\" title=\"\">a food crisis</a> sparked by drought last year. Across the region, above average rainfall has been recorded in 2012. Predictions for southern Mali by Fewsnet, the US early warning system, suggest at least 93% of the millet crop will be successful. Although there have been pockets of drought, and the rains may be in danger of petering out before October in some regions, anecdotal evidence suggests prices in local markets are starting to ease.</p> <p>But good news on the rains risks signalling that everything is back to normal. Oxfam is trying to stop donor and media attention turning elsewhere, saying: \"The food crisis is far from over and an increase in aid is still needed to help farmers and herders overcome the triple challenges of recurrent droughts, persistent poverty and political instability.\"</p> <p>The Sahel crisis is about much more than rain, or lack of it. Yes, in the years when the rains fail more people are pushed into hunger, but the NGO message is that this is something that will take years to fix. \"Deep-rooted change is what is needed, not just a good harvest,\" says Denise Brown, head of the World Food Programme (WFP) in Niger.</p> <p>Three droughts since 2005 have left millions of families locked out of the food-production cycle. Almost everyone in the region has lost animals, and many have been unable to buy seed for replanting. When crops fail, some families are unable to find the cash to buy supplementary food on the market as prices have been pushed so high. It is thought that the long-term development of millions of children is being affected by \"stunting\", caused by a poor diet over many years.</p> <p>These chronic problems need sustained solutions. Efforts to change farming practices to promote irrigation and protection of water sources must go hand in hand with education, the promotion of women's rights, teaching people about child nutrition, and long-term efforts to promote drought-resistant crop varieties and the creation of grain stores. Initiatives such as Niger's <a href=\"http://reliefweb.int/report/niger/national-strategy-against-famine\" title=\"\">Trois N</a>'s are homegrown attempts to tackle chronic food security in all its aspects.</p> <p>\"One good harvest doesn't lead automatically to self-sufficiency in food production,\" says Mamadou Diop from Action Against Hunger, ACF International in Bamako. \"It's hard to explain to donors that there are people who have basically been living with malnourishment for many years, even when the harvest has been 'normal'.\"</p> <p>And while things may be looking fairly positive in Niger \u2013 where the government of President Mahamadou Issoufou, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/mar/22/niger-election-tandja-issoufou-chatelot\" title=\"\">in place since April 2011</a>, has tried to show itself to be committed to tackling food insecurity \u2013 the picture is not so rosy elsewhere. The political crisis in neighbouring <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jul/13/international-response-mali-inadequate\" title=\"\">Mali has only compounded the hunger problem</a>. More than 300,000 people have been displaced in the Islamist takeover of the north, leaving behind animals and untended fields and fleeing to refugee camps, where they depend on handouts.</p> <p>\"Displaced people cannot plant their seeds, and have no access to money to buy food,\" says Mbacke Niang, Oxfam's country director in Bamako. \"Security and logistics for us in the north have become so much more complicated since the collapse of government authority there.\"</p> <p>Overall, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/mar/09/urgent-action-sahel-humanitarian-emergecny\" title=\"\">the donor response to the 2011-12 Sahel appeal</a> has been quite good. Nearly 60% of the funds required have been provided so far. Although there has been an obvious peak in the number of malnourished under-fives being treated in hospitals across the whole region, anecdotal evidence suggests the numbers have been below the 1 million severely acutely malnourished babies predicted by NGOs earlier in the year. The worst of the lean season is now over, and the first harvest is about to be collected.</p> <p>This seeming success may be attributable to aid agencies sounding the alarm early at the end of 2011 \u2013 in part because many had been <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/feb/16/east-africa-crisis-response-effective-not-fast\" title=\"\">stung by criticisms of a late response to last year's famine in Somalia</a>. And, according to Brown, the aid effort was co-ordinated. \"Everybody played their role \u2013 there was no squabbling between NGOs, and the parameters of intervention were clear. High-level visits are still going on, and donors can see a glimmer of hope here.\"</p>"
