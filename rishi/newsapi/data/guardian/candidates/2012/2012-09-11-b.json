  "<p>Many commentators are writing daily pieces on President Obama's bounce. I wrote an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/10/obama-gets-lift-romney-flatlines\">analysis of Obama's bounce</a> on Monday, trying to place it in a larger context. My conclusion was there can be little doubt that Obama received some bounce coming out of the Democratic national convention.</p> <p>I will not, however, be updating this piece daily with each and every piece of new polling information. The media and our society thrive on the constant updating of news, but the fact is that there's little else meaningful to add about the bounce at this point \u2013 until there's more data and we can get a clear read. Yes, there is evidence that Obama's bounce is continuing. Gallup has President Obama <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/157406/obama-gets-three-point-convention-bounce.aspx\">jumping out to his largest lead</a> in its tracker since April. It also has his approval holding at 50%.</p> <p>But we can also find evidence that Obama's <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/campaign-spot/316497/abcwashpost-poll-obama-bump-dropped-6-points-about-even-saturday\">bounce is receding</a>. The ABC/Washington Post poll had Obama's lead at six points among all voters on Friday. By Saturday and Sunday, Obama and Mitt Romney were \"about evenly matched among registered voters\".</p> <p>On the state level, things are just as frustrating. <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2012/09/obamas-lead-up-to-5-in-ohio.html\">Public Policy Polling</a> had Obama's Ohio lead at 5 points. That's higher than their previous poll, but only by 2 percentage points. They saw no bounce for Obama in <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2012/09/north-carolina-remains-extremely-tight.html\">North Carolina</a>. SurveyUSA recorded an expanding Obama edge in <a href=\"http://kstp.com/article/stories/S2760311.shtml?cat=89\">Minnesota</a>, but not in <a href=\"http://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=c1eccb63-bd54-455c-bf33-b3d78bb1ec93\">Washington</a>.</p> <p>The overall picture can only be described as murky at this point. I only know that President Obama is likely in the lead. Beyond that, individual polls differ considerably in their snapshot of where this race stands.</p> <p>My advice has been and continues to be to allow the situation to settle. We won't know the ultimate effect of the conventions on the race for president until at least a week from both conventions. John McCain led in the <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/obama_vs_romney_compared_to_obama_vs_mccain.html\">polling average</a> through 16 September 2008, before Obama overtook him for good \u2013 nearly two weeks after the end of the Republican national convention (which went second that year).</p> <p>That's why you won't find me pontificating on any definite effect of either convention until early next week or about 17 September. Only then will we begin to know who \"won the conventions\", and whether President Obama received a temporary bounce or sustained boost.</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 We must scale back the NHS, says the coalition. Those \u00a320bn cuts will hurt, but it will be worth it. And this is all well and good until a senior Tory finds that cuts or bold changes are planned in their constituency. On those occasions, each diminution becomes an outrage. The latest to distinguish himself in this regard is the foreign secretary, William Hague, whose battle to protect consultant led maternity and paediatric services <a href=\"http://www.darlingtonandstocktontimes.co.uk/news/9921777.Plans_announced_to_downgrade_services_at_Friarage_Hospital__Northallerton/\" title=\"\">at Northallerton's Friarage hospital has failed</a>. Those responsible have decided Hague knows as much about health as diplomacy. Hague says he is disappointed the commissioners have been \"unable to find a unique solution to the challenges facing the hospital\". With gusto, he calls on critics to maintain their opposition. Unless they are trade unionists. They should never rock the boat and should always do exactly as they are told.</p> <p>\u2022 In that respect, Tuesday was a good day for the unions. Worth treasuring. They're aren't many of them. In a triumph for conference management, only a few heckles greeted the speech of the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, at the TUC in Brighton. And all of the strictly unofficial material mentioning anything about the possible sad demise of Baroness Thatcher was exiled \"under the counter\". It all went off very well. Good work.</p> <p>\u2022 And a happy time for constituents of Jeremy Hunt, the new health secretary. The voters of south-west Surrey have not previously viewed their MP as a man to stand by the righteous against the might of giant corporations. The minister for Murdoch didn't get where he is today by speaking truth to power. But there he is, <a href=\"http://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/s/2119483_jeremy_hunt_to_look_into_tescos_godalming_plans\" title=\"\">leading the charge against plans for a Tesco Express</a> in Godalming. Practically Braveheart, isn't he? But then, Tesco don't own any friendly newspapers.</p> <p>\u2022 Best to stay on the right side of the public or risk the fate of George Osborne, exposed at the Olympic stadium to being booed by 80,000 people. A politician's nightmare. Still they talk about it in parliament. We were told, said Labour's Angela Eagle, \"that a Conservative government would 'crowd-source' ideas, because Conservatives believe in collective wisdom. Will the leader of the House commend the chancellor for going to the Olympic stadium the other night to do his own little experiment with crowd-sourcing, and can he tell us what the chancellor will be doing with the answer he got?\" Seeking revenge, one suspects. Brace yourselves. \u00a310 per hot pasty.</p> <p>\u2022 Troubling early days for Mitt Romney, as it seems Obama might not beat himself and might not even be bested by the state of the economy. Mitt needs help and fast. But he'll be smart enough to set his face against the stalwart Republican preacher Pat Robertson. Last year, Robertson berated his Republicans for being too extreme. This week, the same Robertson advised a man seeking guidance on ways to rein in his wife, who just won't respect him as the head of the household. \"<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2201343/Pat-Robertson-tells-man-Saudi-Arabia-beat-wife.html\" title=\"\">Well, you could become a Muslim and you could beat her</a>,\" says Pat, pronouncing on his show The 700 Club. \"Somebody's gotta stand up to her, and he can't let her get away with this stuff. I don't think we condone wife-beating these days, but something's gotta be done to make her ... \" \"Not physically, of course,\" interjects startled co-host Terry Meeuwsen. Robertson is unmoved. \"You can't divorce her, according to the scripture,\" he says. Better \"move to Saudi Arabia\". Remember that preacher Pat once tried to run for president.</p> <p>\u2022 Finally, Tony Blair and Dominique de Villepin were prime ministers at the same time on the two sides of the Channel. Both left office with the suggestion they may have been involved in monkey business \u2013 war crimes for Tony, financial shenanigans for De Villepin. On Monday, De Villepin was humiliatingly dragged into police custody to be quizzed under caution in a grotty Paris police station for his alleged crimes. Tony, meanwhile, relaunched, was preening over the Olympics and counting the cool million collected <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/10/xstrata-chairman-shareholders-glencore-merger?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">from his Qatari employers</a> for three hours fixing on a commercial deal.

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>England's World Cup qualification campaign begins here tonight.</strong> OK, technically it began <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/sep/07/moldova-england-live-world-cup-qualifers\">last Friday night in Moldova</a>, but everyone involved knew that was just a box-ticking exercise, well as England played in dispatching the minnows. This is their first big Group H test. It is on!</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>\"It\", that said, should still be an easy enough home victory.</strong> England have played Ukraine five times previously, winning four, the most recent being that game nobody quite remembers from Euro 2012. Their one loss came in October 2009, a 1-0 defeat which meant little, for they had already qualified for the 2010 World Cup. History is on England's side.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>But Oleg Blokhin - or \u041e\u043b\u0435\u0433 \u0411\u043b\u043e\u0445\u0456\u043d if we're being pedantic - would love to gain a modicum of revenge over the teakm which knocked Ukraine out of their own tournament last summer.</strong> England are strong favourites for the victory tonight - you can win a bumper \u00a34 jackpot for an \u00a311 investment at your local turf accountancy - but Ukraine might just be in the mood to go for this. Blokhin has stated that his side \"will lose 8-0\" if they come out with the defeatist attitude (perhaps understandably) shown by the Moldovans. So hopefully, for the purposes of entertainment, they'll fly out of the blocks, and this could be quite the ding-dong affair. It's also to be hoped that Blokhin loses his rag again at some point before, during or after the match, so he comes up with another euphemism for throwing hands as good as \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/jun/20/euro-2012-oleh-blokhin-ukraine-outburst\">man conversation</a>\".</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Kick off:</strong> Eight bells.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>England:</strong> Hart, Johnson, Jagielka, Lescott, Baines, Lampard, Gerrard, Milner, Cleverley, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Defoe.<br>Subs: Ruddy, Walker, Bertrand, Cahill, Carrick, Livermore, Lallana, Sturridge, Welbeck, Sterling, Butland.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Ukraine:</strong> Pyatov, Gusev, Khacheridi, Rakitskiy, Selin, Tymoschuk, Rotan, Yarmolenko, Garmash, Konoplianka, Zozulya.<br>Subs: Koval, Shevchuk, Bezus, Mandzyuk, Nazarenko, Stepanenko, Butko, Devic, Dykan.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Cuneyt Cakir (Turkey)</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>The teams are out!</strong> England are in their trademark white with trademark red and no trademark blue. Ukraine sport their blue away shirts with blue breeks. And then the anthems. Ukraine's achieves a feat hitherto thought melodically impossible: it's even more of a dirge than God Save The Queen. Nevertheless, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1oMKa-BSvU\">I prefer it</a>. Shche ne vmerla Ukraina!</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>And we're off!</strong> England get the ball rolling, and lose it with extreme speed. A couple of challenges. Gerrard is limping around after a clatter with Zozulya, while Garmash is rolling around on the floor in agony, having been pelted with the ball. This is carnage. Onwards and upwards.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> Ukraine are enjoying a lot of the ball here. Hopefully it'll stay that way for a while, if only to shut the house band up awhile. \"Nice to see where you're setting the bar for tonight by linking to something we can't see because, apparently, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/jun/20/euro-2012-oleh-blokhin-ukraine-outburst\">the copyright has expired</a>,\" writes Phil Sawyer, one ironic eyebrow going up and down so quickly it should come with a warning for epileptics. \"I'm quite tempted to have that on my gravestone: 'This content has been removed as our copyright has expired'.\" That's what I get for only reading down as far as the headline. But what a headline! Tells you all you need to know, and leaves everything else up to the imagination. It's our version of Hemingway's \"For Sale, Baby Shoes, Never Worn\". Sort of.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>4 min:</strong> Yarmolenko makes some space for himself down the right and loops a cross towards the far post. And it's towards the far post alright, because the ball hits that wooden upright after evading a confused Hart. The ball had been deflected, and bounces out for a corner which is easily cleared.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> Well this is quite a start from Ukraine. Husyev is sent towards the right-hand byline by Yarmolenko, who sends a low ball into the six-yard box. Zozulya traps with his back to goal, but can't control properly, and England hack clear. This is a very confident opening period from the visitors.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> But England respond well through Johnson, who was excellent going forward in Moldova and looks up for it tonight too. He takes on Selin, and waltzes past him into the area. He keeps drifing inside, then looks to slip in Lampard, who's bombing down the inside-right channel. But Rakitskly gets in the way to hoick the ball away from danger.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> England are living dangerously here. Konoplyanka twists down the left, finds some space, and curls a ball into the area for the onrushing Yarmolenko, who picks up the ball level with the left-hand post ten yards out. But he can't kill it dead, and it zips through to Hart, who was alert to the danger. Still, if the Ukrainian displayed a better touch there, England would probably be a goal down now.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> Defoe picks the ball up down the inside-left channel, drops a shoulder, and unleashes an absolute pearler into the bottom-left corner! It would be one of the great England goals of recent times - but in making good down the channel, he put his hand into the throat of Yarmolenko, who hits the ground. It's a bit of an over-reaction by the Ukrainian, but the referee's well within his rights to blow for a free kick, which is exactly what he does. It's probably also worth noting that the whistle went, clearly and loudly, well before Defoe hit his shot.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> Cleverley is robbed by Tymoshchuk in the middle of the park, putting England in all sorts of bother. Rotan slides the ball out left to Konoplyanka, who cuts inside and bundles the ball back for Zozulya, who looks to sidefoot into the bottom-right corner. He beats Hart, and the ball's going in, but Gerrard is back to clear superbly. England would have been livid had they conceded then, straight off the back of what was admittedly a soft free kick that cost them a goal.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>16 min:</strong> That was a fairly hectic few minutes, and the game's settled down again. England are struggling to get much in the way of possession, though, with Ukraine happily stroking it around the middle. \"Thought you'd be covering the Scotland game tonight, Scott, in honour of Olympic gold medallist and US Open champion Andy Murray and his new best buds Sirs Sean and Alex,\" writes Simon McMahon. \"Actually, probably wise to do England. Nothing is guaranteed to kill the party mood quicker than watching the Scotland football team.\" Aye, preach on brother. But regardless of what Levein's mob are up to, what's in danger of harshing Sir Sean's buzz? Marbella hasn't entered a team in the World Cup, has it?</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> This has got a very vague England-Italy-at-Euro-2012 feel all of a sudden. A lot of possession for the men in blue, England hoofing it up the channels whenever they get the chance. Nobody's really getting anywhere at present. \"Don't know when that pic of the mighty Sven was taken,\" begins John Smyth, \"but that Ericsson factory in Basingstoke has since been shuttered. As long lasting as Sven's own legacy.\" But at least twice as memorable, if your email alone is anything to go by.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>22 min:</strong> This is better from England, who are pinging it around patiently in the midfield. Eventually something nearly comes off for them, when Gerrard quickens the pace by sliding a ball straight down the middle for Defoe, who with his back to goal flicks it down the inside-right channel for Milner. The Ukraine defence panics a wee bit, but Pyatov has read the situation well and comes out to claim before Milner can get anywhere near the ball.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> Ukraine were the better side during the opening 15 minutes or so, and England have done well to impose themselves on this game. Not in the dramatic up-and-at-'em sense, it's the possession thing again. But this is modern football, it says here. Anyway, seeing we're in the middle of something of a lull, here's some more on the building Sven opened in Basingstoke back in 2001. \"The building is in Chineham Business Park,\" reports Charlie Beauregard. \"It's ridiculously been built on marsh land so is sinking by about an inch a year which is not quite as quick as Sven's career is heading south.\" That's not too far from the dump, is it? Seeing were in the business of cheap metaphors, which I am.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> Milner's been pretty lively, and here he comes again, blazing down the inside-right channel. He cocks his peg to shoot, but is denied at the last by a magnificent sliding tackle from Selin. From the resulting corner on the right, the ball's flown to the far post, where Jagielka is on hand to nut the ball goalwards. But his effort, while on target, is weak, and easily blocked. This has been a really good few minutes from England, who are playing some calm and considered football.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>29 min:</strong> Ukraine were attacking England at will down either flank for a while, but now the passes aren't sticking. Garmash thinks about making ground down the right, but Gerrard is on hand to break up the move. \"Are we allowed to offer our own six word short stories, a la Hemingway?\" wonders Phil Sawyer. \"'The MBM. Last hope. Hit 'send'.' There. That covers the full gamut of human emotion.\"</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> And then sleepy England nearly concede. Selin strokes a lovely curling, looping ball into the area from deep on the left. The English defence are fannying around, allowing Garmash to get a yard on them. He looks to stud the ball into the net from head height - and with no player near him, dangerous play wouldn't be a problem - but can only guide it over the crossbar. Not sure what anyone in white was doing then, or Hart in his red garb, come to think of it.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> What a miss by Basingstoke boy Tom Cleverley. Gerrard curls a ball into the area from the right. It finds Defoe level with the left-hand post, in acres of space and onside. Defoe miscues a header straight across goal to Cleverley, who only has Pyatov to beat from close range. He sidefoots straight at the keeper. You don't see this sort of nonsense at the Camrose. (Not sure that reference works particularly well outside of north Hampshire, but there you have it.)</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>36 min:</strong> A ball sent into the England area from the left is dummied by Yarmolenko for Zozulya, 12 yards out, level with the far post. He blasts a poor shot over the bar. It's becoming an increasingly difficult game to read, this one, although were this a Man Conversation I'd probably have England ahead on points.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>38 min:</strong> England again with the possession. This is the way forward, even if it's not always the way forward. \"So the ref's called 'Cuneyt'?\" notes Nick Pettigrew. \"I take it we're not touching that joke, then?\" No. No we are not. Got some Guardian values going on over here!</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>39 min: GOAL!!! England 0-1 Ukraine. </strong> What an amazing goal this is. Tymoshchuk has the ball in the middle of the English half. He takes a touch and knocks the ball wide left for Konoplyanka, who advances on the area, cuts inside, and curls a pacy effort into the top-right corner. Hart had absolutely no chance whatsoever, that was a stupendous strike.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> Cleverley romps down the right but his cross - hectically hit, the player desperate to make amends for that miss - is overhit. Oxlade-Chamberlain works well down the left to salvage a corner out of the situation, but the set piece is poor and comes to naught. \"If Sven's business park is in a marsh, then presumably it was built on the island in the marsh, or in northern parlance t'island,\" begins one-man double-act Robin Hazlehurst, a feedline which sets himself up for this: \"Which, coincidentally enough, is where Sven is now rumoured to be.\" He's here all week, ladies and gentlemen. Try the Chicken Kiev.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> Ukraine are looking to see the half out, but it's getting desperate. Milner is <em>this</em> close to breaking free down the right, but he can't quite control. The ball's soon coming straight back at Ukraine, with Lampard taking his turn to skate free down the right. His low pullback finds Cleverley in the middle, eight yards out, but the young man's confidence looks a wee bit shot, and he fluffs a low-contact sidefoot miles wide left of the target.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> Cleverley's confidence shot, did I say? Not a bit of it. He ran back upfield from that missed chance looking pained, but now he's back, picking up a low ball inside from the right from Milner, dropping a shoulder in the area, and hammering a delicious rising shot past Pyatov and onto the right-hand post. The ball clanks away from danger.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>HALF TIME: England 0-1 Ukraine. </strong> And that's that for the first 45 minutes. England can consider themselves unlucky to be losing, especially as Defoe's strike was ruled out for a very soft foul. But if you raise your hands and dust someone's jowls with them, there's always a chance the ref is going to tootle his whistle. And oh me, oh my, that was some strike by Konoplyanka. It's a goal worthy of winning any match - although England will be hoping desperately that it doesn't get such reward here. Second half should be a cracker.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>HALF-TIME ADVERTISEMENT or Why The 1970s Chicken Kiev Revolution Had To Happen:</strong></p> <!-- Block 33 -->       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bchbbWsfDOA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bchbbWsfDOA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><br>And here's the fantastic Felicity Cloake explaining <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/jun/07/how-cook-perfect-chicken-kiev\">how to cook the perfect chicken \u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432</a>.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>So, here we go, it's the second half!</strong> No changes. Ukraine get the ball rolling. \"Where can I buy these baby shoes you're flogging?\" asks Steve Buist. \"And how much?\"</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> A bit of a shapeless opening to the half. England knock it around a bit, but the possession's squandered when Johnson, down the right, lets the ball roll under his foot and out of play.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> Defoe challenges for a high ball with Tymoshchuk. He plants his left elbow - not with any great force, it has to be said - into the Ukrainian's coupon. He's booked for his trouble, and can't really complain. Although that's exactly what he does do.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> Gerrard sprays the ball wide right for Johnson, who romps towards the box. He trundles a magnificent ball along the corridor of uncertainty. It bounces straight through the six-yard box and away for a corner on the left, having taken the smallest of deflections off a Ukrainian peg. The corner is a total nonsense. \"Guardian values?\" splutters Dan Brake apropos my 38th-minute diktat re dubious ref-based wordplay. \"I remember a time when you could never print an article without a spelling mistake.\" Stay awhile. Click around. You'll find something soon enough.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> Oxlade-Chamberlain gifts the ball to Yarmolenko down the right. Yarmolenko whips a dangerous ball straight through the area, forcing Johnson to slide out for a corner to the left of goal with Zozulya lurking. The resulting corner isn't particularly good, but does allow Rotan to drag a risible shot wide left of goal.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>52 min:</strong> Defoe fights down the inside-left channel. On the edge of the area, the ball breaks to Lampard, who hits a first-time effort with the outside of his boot, looking for the top right. It's a clever off-the-cuff attempt, but always sailing wide right of goal.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> England have started pinging long balls down the channel again. It's not working for them. Gerrard is booked for planting his elbow, Defoe style, in Rotan's right cheek. That's drawn blood, and could easily have been a red card. A harsh red card, maybe, but you couldn't have run the referee out of town if he'd decided to punish the England captain further. Meanwhile here's Carey Smith with his own entry into the flash fiction canon: \"Brazil 2014. Final Tickets. Must Sell.\"</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>56 min:</strong> Selin is booked for clattering clumsily into Milner down the right. The free kick is level with the six-yard box. Gerrard swings it to the near post, where Yarmolenko heads clear with purpose. That was awful.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> What a run by Konoplyanka, who eats up half of the left wing with a burst that burns off Jagielka. He swings the ball into the centre for Zozulya, who connects at high speed but sees his effort deflected out for a corner. The set piece, sent in from the right, hits Garmesh on the shoulder and sails into Hart's hands. \"If we're discussing Hemingway-esque six-word short stories surely we can't ignore Mr. Roy's favourite new piece of fiction: 'Lampard and Gerrard can play together',\" writes Alex Hanton. \"A heartbreaking piece. Recommended by his predecessor I believe.\"</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> Tymoshchuk gifts the ball to Defoe, who scampers off down the left. The striker looks for support, but Cleverley can't keep up, and the centre is engulfed in a sea of blue.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>62 min:</strong> England are pressing forward a wee bit for the first time in a while. Defoe, Baines and Oxlade-Chamberlain all take turns to slap shots goalwards, but everything's mopped up easily enough. A lot of huff and puff with not much end product so far, but this is at least an improvement on the opening period of the half, which hasn't been great from an English perspective.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>63 min:</strong> Basingstoke's Tom Cleverley is replaced by Welbeck. \"A short story about a possible Ukranian win,\" offers Robin Hazlehurst: \"Vodka celebration. Outside now! Man conversation.\" Isn't this beat poetry?</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Ukraine seem quite happy to sit back, defend their lead, and see what happens on the break. Husyev isn't far from making something quite dangerous happen down the inside-right channel. \"I'm watching a Ukranian stream (don't ask), and the commentator keeps referring to Steven Gerrard as 'our commander',\" reports Robert Johnson. \"Do you think he's being ironic?\" Is he snorting and crying? Can you hear him slapping a thigh? That could be a clue.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> Good work from Johnson down the right, and that's a corner to England. Gerrard, whose last free kick from a not totally dissimilar position was a disgrace to the eyes and all footballing sensibilities, is somehow allowed to take it. It's wasted. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEyaxm26YBI\">Wembley's getting upset!</a></p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>69 min:</strong> Johnson gets pelters for his defensive work, but he always shows up front, and here he cuts inside from the right and fizzes a marvellous low shot towards the bottom left. It's going in, until Pyatov gets a fingertip to it. Adding insult to injury, England don't even get the corner.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> Oxlade-Chamberlain is replaced by Sturridge.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>71 min:</strong> A bad minute for Rotan. First Lescott is booked for hauling down Zozulya 25 yards out. The free kick, in a fairly central position, ends up at Rotan's feet on the edge of the area. He takes a fresh air swipe. Ukraine manage to recycle the ball, but their period of pressure comes to an end when Rotan needlessly passes the ball out of play. Oh Rotan!</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>73 min:</strong> Milner's been one of England's better players tonight - admittedly not the longest of lists - and he glides a cross from the right that's just too high for the head of Defoe in the middle.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> Bertrand replaces Baines. When play restarts, Milner becomes the third England player to go into the book for pressing his mitt into an opponent's mug. Rakitskly is the victim this time round.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> Ukraine make their first change of the evening, swapping Selin for Shevchuk.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>77 min:</strong> Defoe has a lash from distance, but it's no good. Wembley is a very tense place now. Meanwhile here's a joke about the name of tonight's referee from Dan Brake: \"Hemingway was a bit Cuneyt. Apologies for any spelling mistakes.\" I had banned this sort of patter on Guardian style grounds regarding naughty swearies, but this counts as highfalutin literary satire rather than Football Banter, so we shouldn't get too much heat from the readers' editor.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> Garmash is booked for cynically hauling back Welbeck as the striker sashays down the inside left. The set piece is 25 yards from goal. Gerrard hits a decent one this time, curled to the far post, where Jagielka challenges. Pyatov is out to punch. Corner - which is a terrible business. England have turned it up a notch here.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>81 min:</strong> Konoplyanka is a dangerous man. He tears down the left, leaving Johnson in his wake. Luckily for England, they have men back, and more of them than Ukraine have thrown forward. \"Poor, this, isn't it?\" asks Phil Sawyer. \"Sorry, I know that's two words short of a story but, like England tonight, I find myself lacking invention.\"</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> A <em>terrible</em> miss by Welbeck. Gerrard draws a few defenders with a right-to-left run along the face of the Ukraine area. He slips the ball down the wing to Sturridge, who fires a pass into the centre for Welbeck. He's got the ball at his feet, six yards out, but blasts the ball against the left-hand upright and out. He holds his head in his hands, and no wonder. On another day, that'd have pinged off the post and in, but not tonight, and it nevertheless qualifies as a dreadful miss.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> This match has turned wild. Garmash sticks a leg out in the area. Welbeck dives over it. Was there contact? England are sure there was; the ref - standing right in front of the incident - is having none of it. Ukraine sweep up the other end. Konoplyanka is sent clear down the left, but Zozulya can't guide in at speed.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>86 min: PENALTY FOR ENGLAND!</strong> Welbeck tries to set himself up in the area with a dink over Khacheridi. The ball clanks against the diving defender's arm. The referee points at the spot this time. Lampard will step up, and ...</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>87 min: GOAL!!! England 1-1 Ukraine.</strong> ... smashes an unstoppable penalty past Pyatov. Wembley erupts!</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>88 min: RED CARD FOR THE ENGLAND CAPTAIN!</strong> Gerrard is booked - and he can have no complaints for a crude lunge on Garmesh from behind. Straight through the player, that could have been a red on its own merits. But it's a second yellow, and he's walking anyway.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>89 min:</strong> Devic replaces Zozulya. Wembley is bouncing at the moment, a mix of relief and righteous annoyance.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> There will be four added minutes of this. The first sees Milner dance down the right, reach the byline, and dink one up into the middle. It's headed clear.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>90 min +1:</strong> Nazarenko replaces Devic.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>90 min +2:</strong> They've just shown the Welbeck penalty incident again. It was an outrageous dive. England can have no complaints.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>90 min +3:</strong> Johnson is booked for a late clip on Shevchuk near the left-hand corner flag.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>FULL TIME: England 1-1 Ukraine.</strong> Hart deals easily enough with the resulting free kick, and that is that. England will feel some relief here at snatching a draw, but have dropped two points at home in their first big test. That's far from ideal. More worryingly, for vast parts of the match, they were very much second best to unfancied opponents. Still, onwards and upwards. And at least England don't have Scotland's problems.</p>",
  "<p>According to the <a href=\"http://international.sp.nl/\" title=\"\">Dutch Socialist party</a>'s magazine, the party advocates a new Europe of a \"real democracy close to people, with space for local culture and identity based on social policy for the whole EU\" (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/09/dutch-elections-measure-volatile-eurozone?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Extremes find common cause</a>, 10 September). The model of centre parties defending our democracy against extremist parties of the left and right is more a product of ideology than reality. To compare the Socialist party, which will \u2013 if elected to participate in the government today \u2013 make society more liberal and more social, with the fascist Freedom party is beyond comprehension. History should have taught us by now that all anti-fascists and democrats should stand together against the racist ideology of the new and not-so-new right.</p> <p>The lack of a political party in Britain like the Dutch Socialist party, the United Left in Spain, Syriza in Greece or Germany's Die Linke tells us much about the poverty of our political culture. <br><strong>Andreas Wiesner</strong><br><em>Macclesfield, Cheshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Gavin Kelly's perceptive view of the 2015 election (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/09/2015-election-economy-tory-labour?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Casting ahead to 2015, no leader likes what he sees</a>, 10 September) refers to \"fairness in austerity \u2013 fertile terrain for Miliband\". Labour can win the election outright with an emphasis on fairness and justice as the dominant themes of the manifesto and campaign. By stressing how much of the failure of the austerity programme can only be described by adjectives of exactly opposite meaning, and how none of it was in the Tory manifesto, Ed Miliband can win on the \"fairness\" ticket.</p> <p>Putting forward policies which promote fairness \u2013 such as restoring the 50% band, perhaps at \u00a3140,000, appointing more tax inspectors and increasing corporate transparency, introducing a Tobin tax and a creating nationalised bank for investment in small businesses \u2013 could be a vote-winner.

I would suggest that Ed Miliband looks at history, rather than listening to the wishful thinking of Mr Wilby and others who promote this view. Since the great reforming Attlee government, only two Labour leaders have won general elections, both unashamed pragmatists. Harold Wilson won four times (one as a minority government) and Tony Blair won three (handsomely).</p> <p>I have no doubt that he would have won another in 2010, had he not been pushed out \u2013 mainly by the Tory press, which knew it would never beat him. Remember, his last victory was in 2005, two years after the invasion of Iraq. Unfortunately, the Labour left swallowed the Tory press line \u2013 believing, for some reason, that Gordon Brown, the friend of the City, was somehow to the left of Blair.</p> <p>Labour leaders elected to move the party to the left \u2013 Foot (rather than Healey), Kinnock (rather than Hattersley) \u2013 made the party unelectable. Kinnock could not even defeat John Major, whom the Tories had set up as the fall guy for an expected defeat.

  "<p>US politicians came under renewed pressure to resolve a dispute over $1.2tn worth of spending cuts and tax increases after the ratings agency Moody's said it would probably cut its AAA rating if negotiations fail before a 1 January deadline.</p> <p>As the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, warned that the global economy was burdened by the US's huge debts, Moody's ratcheted up the pressure on Congress to prevent the \"fiscal cliff\" from sending the economy into a nosedive next year.</p> <p>A failure to strike a deal by the new year will allow time-limited tax breaks and spending commitments first implemented by former president George W Bush to lapse. Barack Obama has already extended the tax breaks but has refused to back them in the run-up to the presidential election.</p> <p>Democrats argue that the package includes huge concessions to the wealthiest 1% and that they have widened the income and wealth gap during the recovery from the financial crisis. But Republicans have refused to make concessions that would maintain the tax breaks for middle-income families while excluding the richest groups.</p> <p>John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, said he was not confident Congress could reach a budget deal and avoid the downgrading. He said the Senate needed to act and President Obama needed to show \"leadership\". Any real negotiations are not expected until after the November presidential elections.</p> <p>A year ago, Moody's cut its outlook on US debt to \"negative,\" which acts as a warning that it might downgrade the rating after partisan wrangling over raising the government borrowing limit almost triggered a default.</p> <p>Rival agency Standard &amp; Poor's took the drastic step of stripping the government of its AAA rating on its bonds around the same time. Fitch Ratings issued a warning of potential downgrade.</p> <p>In its report on Tuesday Moody's noted that the government will probably reach the debt limit again by the end of the year, which means another round of negotiations in Congress on raising the limit if the government is to keep paying its bills.</p> <p>\"Under these circumstances, the government's rating would likely be placed under review after the debt limit is reached, but several weeks before the exhaustion of the Treasury's resources,\" the Moody's analyst Steven A Hess said in his report.</p> <p>Despite the rating cut last year from S&amp;P and the warnings from Moody's and Fitch, the government has been able to continue borrowing at very low rates.</p> <p>Investors see the US as a haven from economic turmoil in Europe and uncertainty in other parts of the world.</p>",
  "<p>Bill Clinton, less than a week after his triumphant appearance in front of the Democratic national convention, began a tour of battleground states across the US in a bid to help Barack Obama win re-election to the White House.</p> <p>In response to a request from Obama for help, Clinton promised to campaign alongside the president as well as on his own.</p> <p>The former president was scheduled to follow up appearances in Florida on Tuesday and Wednesday with trips to Iowa, Ohio, Nevada, New Hampshire and Wisconsin. He has also promised to help with fundraising. </p> <p>Obama's request for help contrasts with Al Gore in 2000 who famously rejected Clinton's help, wanting to win on his own, and lost.<br> Republican strategists last week praised Clinton after an old-fashioned barnstorming speech to the convention, with one saying the former president had won the election for Obama. </p> <p>Republican challenger Mitt Romney said in an interview on Sunday that Clinton had \"elevated\" the Democratic convention and mischievously contrasted Obama's performance unfavourably with the former president.<br>Clinton was due to speak in Miami before heading for another speech in Orlando today. </p> <p>He is capable of firing up parts of the Democratic base that have proved resistant to Obama, particularly white, working-class males.</p> <p>He made some appearances in the 2008 campaign to help boost Obama, but he failed to work his magic campaigning for Democratic candidates in the 2010 mid-term Congressional elections in which the Democrats were trounced.<br> Clinton's intervention comes as polls show Obama appears to have gained more from the party conventions than Romney. After months in which the two have been neck-and-neck, Obama opened up a six-point lead among registered voters in an ABC/Washington Post poll published Monday, putting him on 50% to Romney's 44%. That lead had to be tempered by the findings among likely voters, which showed the two tied.</p> <p>A CNN/ORC International poll the previous day also suggested Obama secured a bounce from the Democratic convention, putting him at 52% compared to 46% for Romney.</p> <p>Clinton was involved in bad-tempered exchanges during the 2008 fractious fight for the party's presidential nomination between Hillary Clinton and Obama. The former president was scathing about Obama during the primaries and caucuses, leaving a bad feeling between the Obama and Clinton camps that have lingered until now.</p> <p>Obama and Clinton chatted backstage together during the convention, and the former president agreed to do more campaign events.</p> <p>Relations between the Clinton and Obama camps have improved in part because Hillary Clinton has proven to be a loyal secretary of state, with no leaks or hints of criticism of the White House coming from her office in almost four years.</p> <p>She is due to stand down soon after the election, saying she is exhausted. She is planning to write her memoirs of her time the state department but not about her acrimonious battles with Obama for the Democratic nomination.</p> <p>She has emerged as favourite to be the Democratic nominee for the White House in 2016. It might be easier for her to follow an Obama presidency, given economic predictions that recovery should be well underway by then, than Romney seeking a second term, getting credit for any economic improvements. </p> <p>Apart from his new campaign commitments, Clinton will host his annual conference for his foundation, Global Initiative, which gives millions of dollars to the developing world.</p> <p>Both Obama and Romney are to speak at the conference in New York later this month.</p> <p>An Obama fundraising dinner is planned for London next week hosted by, among others, Vogue editor Anna Wintour and actress Gwyneth Paltrow, according to the US-based Sunlight Foundation which tracks campaign funding. </p> <p>The foundation said the 19 September dinner, at Mark's Club in Mayfair, is seeking contributions of between $15,000 and $40,000 to attend.</p>",
  "<p>Germany's supreme court has long enjoyed a reputation that it is good for surprises. But its eight judges will never have felt their capacity for creating so much drama as in the run-up to a ruling they are due to deliver on Wednesday, and which could decide the future of the euro and even influence the world economy.</p> <p>The court in Karlsruhe is expected to announce whether Germany's participation in a permanent European bailout fund is in line with the country's constitution, a decision that has Angela Merkel's government on tenterhooks.</p> <p>If the court rules in favour of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) and the fiscal pact on countries' budget limits, then debt-ridden countries like Spain and Greece will be able to be kept afloat as part of Europe's blueprint for tackling debt contagion in the eurozone.</p> <p>If the court rules against the plan, Europe may find itself in turmoil, with markets likely to react with panic to a decision that would have the potential to topple the single currency.</p> <p>A late legal challenge by a conservative member of the German parliament was rejected by the court on Tuesday, ensuring that the judges would stick to their original plan to deliver their long-awaited verdict on the bailout.</p> <p>But most analysts agree that the judges, not wishing to go down in history as the court that brought down the German government, and the euro and plunged the world economy into gloom, are likely vote in favour of the bailout mechanism.</p> <p>\"I don't think the court will strike down the ESM, because it wouldn't like to be seen to be killing off the euro. Just as the German government doesn't have the courage to do that, neither does the court. If it ruled that the government had adopted a wrong decision, it would cause a huge crisis of legitimacy in Germany,\" said Gunnar Beck, an EU law expert at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. \"Never in the 60-year history of the court has there been an example of the court killing an essential piece of government policy.\"</p> <p>What he and other analysts believe, though, is that the court will choose a \"middle way\" \u2013 allowing the ESM to go ahead but not without insisting on tight limits and conditions that would affect the Bundestag's decision-making procedures on future aid and further European integration.</p> <p>The court's decision not to accept the last-minute appeal by the eurosceptic MP Peter Gauweiler made a positive ruling more likely, analysts said. Gauweiler, who has plenty of allies within the government, had argued that Germany should not agree to the ESM until the European Central Bank reversed its bond-buying plan announced last week, which critics say will stoke inflation and offers no incentive for debt-ridden countries to reform. Gauweiler might still refile his challenge following the rejection.</p> <p>The case was brought by 37,000 petitioners, including academics, ordinary Germans, and members of Merkel's own party. Their main concern is that their taxes are being used to prop up parts of Europe they view as irresponsibly profligate.</p> <p>All eyes are on the constitutional court president, Andreas Vossk\u00fchle, who will deliver the historical verdict at 10am local time on Wednesday. Vossk\u00fchle, a quietly spoken 48-year-old lover of abstract art who eschews the limelight, is believed to support the growing concern in Germany that too much power is being ceded to Brussels. He once said the citizens of Germany \"shouldn't one morning wake up and find out that the people they elected have nothing to decide anymore\".</p> <h2>Sch\u00e4uble chastises US borrowing</h2> <p>Not content with taking a hard line with fellow eurozone countries that get too far into debt, Germany's finance minister turned his fire on America's borrowing habit.</p> <p>In a Bundestag speech to open a debate on the 2013 budget, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble said worries about US debt were a burden for the global economy and questioned how the US would deal with high levels of government debt after the November presidential election \u2013 hitting back at Washington's criticism of Europe for failing to get a grip on its own debt crisis.</p> <p>In private, German officials often express concern about US debt levels and the inability of politicians there to reach a consensus on how to reduce it, but Sch\u00e4uble's public remarks underscore the extent of the worries in Germany.</p> <p>\"Ahead of the election in the US there is great uncertainty about the course American politics will take in dealing with government debts, which are much too high,\" Sch\u00e4uble said.</p> <p>\"We need to remind ourselves of that sometimes and the global economy knows that and is burdened by it.\"</p> <p>The issue has become a central theme of the US election campaign with Republican candidate Mitt Romney accusing President Barack Obama of fiscal mismanagement.</p>",
  "<p>The reputation of the US in Europe risks sinking back to Bush-era levels of unpopularity if Mitt Romney becomes president, according to new international polling published on Tuesday.</p> <p>Only around one in 20 of those surveyed in Britain, France and Germany by YouGov held a positive view of the Republican presidential nominee. </p> <p>The poll of more than 12,000 people across Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, Pakistan and China <a href=\"http://www.yougov.polis.cam.ac.uk/\">was prepared for the YouGov-Cambridge forum this week</a> at which the Guardian is a media partner.</p> <p>The results are a sign that affection for Barack Obama has diminished little since his 2008 speech in Berlin in which he promised to restore America's reputation on the world stage, even though, four years on, Guant\u00e1namo remains open and the US is still engaged in military action in Afghanistan.</p> <p>But while Europeans had a strongly negative reaction to Romney, the prospect of him winning the White House was greeted with less dismay in Pakistan, where about 13% of respondents said it would make them more favourable to the US, compared to just 9% who said it would make them less favourable. </p> <p>This is possibly a reflection of the anger towards the Obama administration over drone attacks which have led to civilian deaths and are viewed as an infringement of Pakistani sovereignty.</p> <p>There was less antipathy, too, in the Middle East and north Africa, where only 8% said they felt a Romney presidency would make them feel less favourable towards the US.</p> <p>Again, the reason for this may be more to do with negative feelings about the current administration, in particular its failure to mount a serious attempt to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, than warmth for Romney.</p> <p>But the most striking finding was the level of antipathy towards the Republican in Europe. Although he is still largely an unknown quantity outside the US, he alienated many during an ill-fated overseas trip in the summer, particularly in Britain, where he appeared to publicly criticise Olympic planning and the level of enthusiasm for the London games.</p> <p>Forty-seven percent of UK respondents said a Romney victory would make them feel less favourable towards the US, and only 3% would make them feel more favourable.</p> <p>That sentiment was mirrored in Germany and France, where only 4% and 5% respectively said that he would make them feel more favourable towards the US. In Germany, 48% said it would make them feel less favourable and in France 38%.</p> <p>It was not just in Britain that Romney's overseas trip went down badly. </p> <p>French daily Le Figaro, normally staunch conservative, ran a blog with the headline: 'Is Mitt Romney a loser?' In Poland, he was criticised by the Solidarity movement for being anti-unions.</p> <p>A negative poll among Europeans can easily be brushed aside by the Romney campaign, as their views are unlikely to have any impact on the election. Indeed, he might even regard the results as helpful since many Americans, at least in public, claim to be disdainful about European views.</p> <p>One of George Bush's successes in the 2004 campaign was to portray his opponent, John Kerry, as being too French in his tastes and manners. There was also a backlash against France over its opposition towards the Iraq war.</p> <p>But the findings play into a larger question over Romney's foreign policy credentials. Little is known about his position on these issues, mainly because he has had little to say, espousing only three positions: support for Israel in the event of it bombing Iran; a threat to launch a trade war against China over alleged currency manipulation; and identifying Russia as America's main threat.</p> <p>Romney's 30-strong team of advisers includes a large number of neo-conservatives from the Bush era, such as former UN ambassador John Bolton, one of the most public advocates of bombing Iran.</p> <p>The Obama campaign team is seeking to exploit Romney's vulnerability in this area. One of the strongest sections of Obama's otherwise subdued speech to the Democratic convention last week was an attack on his opponent's lack of foreign policy experience. </p> <p>On Monday, the Obama campaign fielded the former Nato supreme allied commander in Europe, General Wesley Clark, to criticise Romney for failing to include any mention of Afghanistan in his speech at the Republican convention in Tampa, Florida, a fortnight ago.</p> <p>The Romney campaign has judged that foreign affairs is not important in a campaign dominated by the country's sluggish economy. But it will come up in at least one of the three presidential debates scheduled for next month.</p> <p>Between 10-25 August 2012, YouGov questioned 12,693 adults across the US, Britain, Europe, the Middle East &amp; north Africa (Mena), Pakistan and China. Data was weighted to be nationally representative of adult populations in Britain, US, France, Germany and the US. Data in Mena, Pakistan and China is representative of the online population.</p>",
  "<p>The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has warned that if the US fails to set clear \"red lines\" for Iran over its nuclear programme, it cannot \"place a red light\" in front of Israel should the Jewish state decide to launch a military strike. \"Those in the international community who refuse to put red lines before Iran don't have a moral right to place a red light before Israel,\" Netanyahu said on Tuesday, following clear indications from the US that it would not be bounced into hardening its position. Israel has been pressing the US to clarify the point at which it would take military action rather than allow the Iranian nuclear programme to advance. Some observers believe that this has been the primary aim of hawkish rhetoric from Netanyahu and his defence minister, Ehud Barak, over recent months.</p> <p>Last week, the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, refused to engage on the \"red lines\" question. \"We're not setting deadlines,\" she said in an interview. Her comment was reinforced on Monday by the state department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland, who said: \"It is not useful to be&#xa0;\u2026 setting deadlines one way or another\" or to outline \"red lines\". She added: \"[President Obama] has said again and again, unequivocally, that we will not allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon.\" But continued talk about specifics was \"not helpful for the diplomacy\".</p> <p>On Tuesday, the US defence secretary, Leon Panetta, estimated that the US would have more than a year to take action against Iran if it decided to proceed with making a nuclear weapon. \"It's roughly about a year right now. A little more than a year. And so&#xa0;\u2026 we think we will have the opportunity once we know that they have made that decision to take the action necessary to stop [Iran],\" Panetta said on CBS's This Morning programme.</p> <p>The US had the capability to prevent Iran from building an atomic bomb, he added. \"We have the forces in place to be able to not only defend ourselves, but to do what we have to do to try to stop them from developing nuclear weapons,\" he said.</p> <p>Barak appears to have softened his earlier hawkish statements on the potential need for Israel to act alone in stopping the Iranian nuclear programme. Last week he hinted that Israel would not defy its \"most important ally\".</p> <p>Most of Israel's current and former military and intelligence establishment is believed to oppose unilateral action in the face of US opposition.</p>",
  "<p>The social care world has not always been convinced that the health world \"gets it\" when it comes to the interdependency of the two systems. With more than nine in 10 respondents in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/11/survey-reveals-nhs-staff-fears-reforms\">Guardian's healthcare network survey</a> recognising that cuts in social care will have a significant impact on health, it appears the message is now heard loud and clear in the NHS. But will it also be heard in government?</p> <p>Last week's reshuffle included the departure from the Department of Health of ministers who, whatever their weaknesses, did show signs that they got it. An unprecedented \u00a34bn of NHS money is being transferred to social care or earmarked to support integration of the systems, recognising that local authorities are being clobbered by cuts, and that investment upstream in care and support in the community saves much more downstream in costly hospital admissions.</p> <p>Will the new health ministers get it too? Health secretary Jeremy Hunt is on a steep learning curve and there will be concern that his presumed brief \u2013 to make the NHS reforms of his predecessor, Andrew Lansley, better appreciated \u2013 will tempt him towards populist policies. These would not include being seen to take money from hospitals to spend on social care.</p> <p>On the other hand, Hunt's deputy Norman Lamb, who replaces his Lib Dem colleague Paul Burstow, comes with a keen grasp of the broader agenda, having been his party's health spokesman before the general election. And Dr Dan Poulter, a new junior minister (impressed as a backbencher and continuing part-time hospital doctor), with his understanding of the health and social care system as a whole.</p> <p>Lamb was a key player in the ill-fated cross-party negotiations on long-term care funding in the runup to the election. His top priority will be for the coalition to commit to implementation of the reform proposals tabled subsequently by the <a href=\"http://www.dilnotcommission.dh.gov.uk\" title=\"\">commission led by economist Andrew Dilnot</a>. Although some journalists were briefed in August that David Cameron had resolved belatedly to do so, having indicated in July that the issue was parked in the long grass, no detail has been forthcoming.</p> <p>The reshuffle, and the Treasury's deepening problems, throw fresh doubt in this direction. <a href=\"http://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/publications\" title=\"\">A report on NHS spending by the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Nuffield Trust</a> put the options starkly: an unreformed social care system would cost an extra 3.3% a year between 2014 and 2022; implementing Dilnot's \u00a335,000 cap on individual lifetime liability for care costs would cost an extra 5.4% a year \u2013 about \u00a33bn more annually by 2022.</p> <p>Yet the wisest heads know that maintaining the status quo would be a false economy.

Even liberal bloggers warn that this strike will leave <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/10/how-teacher-strikes-hurt-student-achievement/\">children forever scarred and ruin their future earnings</a>, or at least their test scores.</p> <p>Teachers might respond that they're not striking over money: both the <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/10/us/illinois-chicago-teachers-strike/index.html\">teachers' union</a> and the <a href=\"http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/09/08/13750577-chicago-school-officials-very-close-to-averting-teachers-strike?lite\">school board</a> acknowledge the two sides are close to agreement on wages. They might point out that their demands that are the real sticking points \u2013 smaller class sizes and air-conditioned classrooms \u2013 are entirely reasonable things most parents also want for their kids. Or they might point out that Mayor Rahm Emanuel's key demand to tie teacher evaluations to student test performance reflects a bureaucratic zeal to replace more and more of the curriculum with <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704869304575109443305343962.html\">standardized tests</a> (one Chicago teacher <a href=\"http://chiteacherx.blogspot.com/2012/09/why-im-striking-jcb.html\">says 18 to 25 days</a> of the school year are already lost to testing) \u2013 an ethos and aim that many parents, and certainly most students, do not share.</p> <p>They could say all of this, but it wouldn't matter. Any union negotiator or human resources manager can tell you that contracts are never settled by who has the best argument. Bargaining is a question of clout, and which side has more of it. Unions have been losing ground for years, public sector unions in particular, and no unionized profession has been more vilified \u2013 by politicians, thinktanks and two <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/leonie-haimson/factchecking-waiting-for-_b_802900.html\">Hollywood</a> <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/09/07/dnc_disses_teachers/\">movies</a> so far \u2013 than teachers.</p> <p>Looking back, this is remarkable. There was a time when teachers were lauded as local heroes: overworked, underpaid pillars of the community who could \u2013 with their credentials \u2013 earn more elsewhere, but chose to pursue a career sharing the joys of learning with kids. Politically, they were untouchable, up there with cops and firefighters. Endorsements by their unions were prized by politicians hoping to run as \"the education candidate\".</p> <p>Then, at a certain point, teachers' unions woke up to find their favorability rating hovering somewhere between al-Qaida's and herpes. This didn't happen overnight, but a confluence of state budget crises, urban blight and suburban flight, a well-funded school reform movement and private charter school industry created the need for a scapegoat for bad public schools. Could it be their financing structure, dependent locally on grossly unequal property tax revenues? Or their unaccountable school boards, such as the one appointed by Rahm Emanuel? Might poverty and unemployment not be to blame? The drug economy? Poor parenting?</p> <p>No, none of the above. It's teachers and their pesky insistence that they know how best to educate kids simply because they spend most of the day with them.</p> <p>Teachers' unions were slow to realize their scapegating and its (for them) dangerous consequences. They were slow to defend against some of the more salacious \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/nov/11/myth-charter-schools/\">but fact-challenged</a> \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/leonie-haimson/factchecking-waiting-for-_b_802900.html\">charges</a> against them. And they have not responded effectively by articulating why teachers should have pensions, job security and collective bargaining rights when other workers were either losing theirs or never had them in the first place.</p> <p>These failures opened the way for New Jersey Governor Chris Christie to make trashing teachers the centerpiece of his political career, in turn setting the stage for Scott Walker in Wisconsin and others. Hard as it is to imagine candidates running for office on a \"screw the troops\" platform, this is essentially the climate teachers find themselves in today.</p> <p>Unfortunately for the Chicago teachers, they are unlikely to see a change in the political weather any time soon. Their union is betting, in no small part, that the embarrassment the strike will cause the Democrats in an election year will push Obama to pressure Emanuel to fix a settlement. Signs point to no such outcome. President Obama sees this as a lose-lose situation \u2013 he'll be seen either as betraying his labor allies or as caving to special interests \u2013 and has explicitly stated his intention to remain uninvolved.</p> <p>Instead, the strike presents less conflict-averse Democrats like Emanuel the opportunity to posture and show off his business-friendly bona fides for Independents and Republicans (Paul Ryan has already given him words of <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/09/paul-ryan-on-chicago-teachers-strike-we-stand-with-mayor-rahm-emanuel/\">encouragement</a>). And nothing has more bipartisan support than blaming teachers for problems mayors and congressional representatives can't solve.</p>",

  "<p>Everyone seems to be for innovation. Innovation-led growth is the mantra of the European commission, the OECD, and politicians like Obama in the US and Vince Cable, with his \"new industrial strategy\" in the UK.</p> <p>But to what degree are we really willing to reform the financial sector so that it is focused more on innovation that produces new jobs, products and services, rather than financial innovation aimed only at increasing the size of the sector's own profits? And have we really attacked the parasitic actions of all dysfunctional finance \u2013 including venture capital (VC) \u2013 or only the easy scapegoats like hedge funds?</p> <p>The question is crucial because different forms of finance are needed for innovation, which is risky \u2013 indeed deeply uncertain. For every successful Google, there are 10 failures. For every internet, there is a Concorde. But one requires the other because innovation is about experimentation, trial and error. And banks \u2013 commercial and investment \u2013 are scared of the risk of failure, preferring to chop up and disperse risk finely, and then get bailed out when things go wrong.</p> <p>In this sense the financial crisis has been about \"bad\" murky risk-taking \u2013 of which the Libor scandal is only the latest. While innovation depends on \"good\", transparent risk-taking that results in new value for the economy. Banks interested in good risk are hard to come by, meaning companies interested in innovation have had to rely on finance from business angels, venture capital, and government funding.</p> <p>But VC, mythologised by many, including Obama and Cable, is no hero either. VC wants quick, relatively low risk, returns \u2013 something that the innovation game cannot provide. In biotech it has generated a host of <a href=\"http://www.finnov-fp7.eu/publications/finnov-discussion-papers/us-biopharmaceutical-finance-and-the-sustainability-of-the-bio\" title=\"\">PLIPOs: product-less IPOs</a> (initial public offerings), which make millions for VC at the time of public offering, but little for the economy in terms of new products and jobs. And they have been the biggest lobbyists, since the early 90s, for reducing capital gains taxes, in the name of rewarding entrepreneurship \u2013 which instead has only resulted in more inequality.</p> <p>Because innovation takes time and requires patient, committed finance, it is no surprise that most radical new technologies have resulted from public funds, whether from public agencies like US defence agency <a href=\"http://www.darpa.mil/our_work/\" title=\"\">Darpa</a> \u2013 which invested in the internet, or state investment banks in China and Brazil that are leading investments in renewable energy \u2013 with VC sitting on the side waiting to enter only when returns are more secure.</p> <p>There are lessons here for both the UK and the US. If in the UK we want to get more lending to innovative \"gazelle\" firms, as the UK business minister <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/11/vince-cable-laissez-faire-work\" title=\"\">Vince Cable is announcing today</a>, a more direct route than simply filling up the coffers of private banks hoping they will all of a sudden be interested in \"good\" risk is necessary. The loads of cash they received from quantitative easing has not been lent to companies interested in the long run, so why hope that this new slosh of money will? We need a British investment bank, run by experts that actually know something about the sectors we wish to develop, and which lends directly to them.</p> <p>And over the Atlantic, Mitt Romney, who has made his money from the private equity company Bain capital, the epitome of a company focused on destructive risk, announced this week that he wants to <a href=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/news/428985/should-the-government-support-applied-research/\" title=\"\">cut the US government budget of Arpa-e's applied research</a> in renewable energy \u2013 which he claims should be focusing only on basic research.</p> <p>If the American people knew that <a href=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/news/428985/should-the-government-support-applied-research/\" title=\"\">publicly funded basic and applied research</a> led to every technology behind the iPhone \u2013 from GPS to touchscreen display, and the internet, Romney's attack on the state as a parasitic meddler would be much harder to pull off. And if they knew that applied research in the US National Institutes of Health publicly funded labs has led to 75% of the most radical new drugs \u2013 while private pharma focuses on more secure variations of existing drugs, boosting their stock prices through huge share repurchase schemes \u2013 it would be much harder to claim that Obama is \"meddling\" in Americans' healthcare. Without the government there would be far fewer innovative drugs to meddle with.</p> <p>But they don't, and the state is being successfully attacked in countries worldwide, not only under the pretext of lowering debt levels, but also of releasing entrepreneurship. But entrepreneurship and innovation require financial institutions that are willing to finance risky productive innovations and incentive mechanisms and tax structures that reward good risk and penalises bad.</p> <p>Instead, apart from increasing bank leverage ratios, which makes lending even harder, and separating commercial and investment banks, which makes the latter more focused on large firms, we have today the same incentives and tax structures that favour speculative over productive finance (eg low capital gains tax, high tax on work). We live in the naive hope that by making banks richer they will wake up and want to fund innovation. But we will have to bail them out again, further down the road, when their only goal of making a quick buck messes things up once more.</p>",
  "<p>Mariano Rajoy, the Spanish prime minister, has said he is more determined than ever to avoid having to ask for a bailout \u2013 despite the insistence last week by ECB president, Mario Draghi, that it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/06/mario-draghi-euro-countries-bonds\" title=\"Guardian: New move to save euro\">would be a condition</a> of the central bank helping to keep down a country's borrowing costs.</p> <p>\"If there is one overriding priority for creating employment it's reducing the public deficit. That is far more important than what people like to call a bailout,\" Rajoy said in a televised interview on Monday night.</p> <p>Draghi announced last week that the bank would buy unlimited quantities of sovereign debt to ensure eurozone governments retained access to funding, but he made it clear that there would be strings attached. However, Rajoy said he was not prepared to accept such conditions. \"I couldn't accept anyone else telling us what our policies should be or where we have to make cuts,\" he said.</p> <p>How this apparent intransigence is received in Brussels and Berlin remains to be seen, but Rajoy received some support for his stance on Tuesday during a visit to Madrid by the Finnish prime minister, Jyrki Katainen, who said a bailout could be avoided as long as the measures taken in Madrid were seen as credible.</p> <p>Rajoy is at pains to show that he is in charge, that he is not the victim of circumstance and that he is making decisions of his own free will and not because they have been imposed on him. He appears to have decided that, if he has to make spending cuts and other unpopular decisions, then he will do it without ceding sovereignty the way the Greeks have been forced to do.</p> <p>His intransigence is perhaps more a manifestation of an old-fashioned, though admirable, sense of honour. During the interview he was candid enough to admit that he had gone back on election promises not to raise income tax and VAT, an admission few politicians are prepared to make. \"The fact is no one told me the deficit was \u20ac90bn [\u00a372bn] and not the \u20ac60bn I was led to expect. If I'd had that \u20ac30bn things would have been different.\"</p> <p>Rajoy also reiterated that he would not adopt any measures that would harm pensioners, while dodging the question of whether he would reform the pension system itself.</p> <p>He insisted, as he has in the past, that no European leader has privately leaned on him to accept a bailout. Nor, he said, has he ever put pressure on the ECB to buy sovereign debt. Pressed on the issue, he said no decision had been taken, adding that he wanted to see what emerged from the next Council of Europe meeting on 18-19 October. This has been interpreted in Madrid to mean that no bailout will be announced before the regional elections, which are due on 21 October in his native Galicia and in the Basque Country. It appears unlikely Draghi was expecting to wait that long for a response.</p>",
  "<p>The United States is beset by four deficits: a fiscal deficit, a jobs deficit, a deficit in public investment, and an opportunity deficit. The budget proposals put forward by the presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his running mate, Paul Ryan, could reduce the fiscal deficit, but would exacerbate the other three.</p> <p>To be sure, Romney and Ryan have failed to provide specifics about how they would reduce the fiscal deficit, relying on \"trust me\" assertions. But the overarching direction of their proposals is clear: more tax cuts, disproportionately benefiting those at the top, coupled with significantly lower non-defence discretionary spending, disproportionately hurting everybody else \u2013 and weakening the economy's growth prospects.</p> <p>Despite 30 months of private-sector job growth, the US still confronts a large jobs deficit. The unemployment rate remains more than two percentage points above the \"normal\" rate (when the economy is operating near capacity). Moreover, the labour-force participation rate remains near historic lows.</p> <p>More than 11m additional jobs are needed to return the US to its pre-recession employment level. At the current pace of recovery, that is more than eight years away. In the meantime, persistent high unemployment reduces the economy's growth potential by robbing today's workers of skills and experience.</p> <p>When weak aggregate demand causes the economy to operate far below its potential, cuts in government spending enlarge the jobs deficit. Indeed, in his recent speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, the US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke warned that such cuts significantly inhibit job creation.</p> <p>Without revealing which programmes he would reduce, Romney promises to slash federal spending by more than $500bn in 2016, capping it at 20% of GDP thereafter. He also promises an immediate 5% cut in non-defence discretionary spending in 2013, on top of the huge cuts already scheduled to take effect. And he has ruled out additional temporary fiscal measures aimed at job creation, like President Barack Obama's proposals for additional grants to states and additional infrastructure spending.</p> <p>Romney acknowledges that large spending cuts, along with the scheduled expiration of tax cuts at the end of this year, could throw the economy back into recession in 2013. But he vows to steer the economy from the fiscal cliff by extending the tax cuts enacted under George W Bush, doubling down with a further 20% across-the-board cut in income-tax rates and cutting the corporate rate from 35% to 25%.</p> <p>With the possible exception of the extension of the Bush-era tax cuts, these changes would take considerable time to implement. Even when enacted, their near-term effects on job creation would be minimal. An across-the-board reduction in tax rates performs poorly in terms of budgetary effectiveness (the number of jobs created per dollar of foregone revenue). Payroll-tax relief and spending on programmes like food stamps and unemployment compensation are much more effective.</p> <p>Romney overstates his tax proposals' long-term growth effects as well. Reducing individual tax rates and taxes on savings and investment at best fosters modest increases in employment, work effort, and income. Despite the Bush-era tax cuts, the 2001-2007 expansion was the worst of the post-war period in terms of investment, employment, wage, and GDP growth. Job creation and growth were much stronger following President Bill Clinton's tax increases in the 1990s.</p> <p>Moreover, if all of Romney's additional tax cuts were financed in a revenue-neutral way, as he promises, only the composition of taxes would change; the overall tax share of GDP would not. There is no evidence that this would significantly boost growth, as Romney claims.</p> <p>Based on what Romney has told us, we can conclude that his plan would exacerbate the public-investment deficit as well. Romney's vow to cap federal spending at 20% of GDP by 2016, while maintaining defence spending at 4% of GDP and leaving both Social Security and Medicare unchanged for those 55 or older, implies exempting more than 50% of government spending from cuts for the next decade. So, to hit the 20% cap, spending on everything else would have to be slashed by an average of roughly 40% by 2016 and 57% by 2022.</p> <p>Everything else includes government investments in three major areas on which growth and high-wage jobs depend: education, infrastructure, and research. These areas account for less than 8% of federal spending, and their share has been declining steadily. Under Romney, it would plummet to new lows.</p> <p>Everything else also includes spending on programmes that help low-income families, like food stamps, student grants, and Medicaid. The Centre on Budget and Policy Priorities finds that almost two-thirds of the Ryan budget's spending cuts would come from such programmes. Romney offers few specifics, but simple arithmetic shows that his plan would require even deeper cuts in these programmes than Ryan's plan would.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Romney's plan would actually increase taxes on middle-income families. His plan would pay for lower income-tax rates by eliminating tax deductions like those for charitable giving and mortgages, while maintaining tax preferences for saving and investment. But there are not enough tax breaks for the rich to cover another 20% reduction in their income-tax rate. That is why the nonpartisan Tax Policy Centre found that Romney's plan would cut overall taxes for households with incomes above $200,000, but would require an average annual tax increase of at least $2,000 for households with incomes between $100,000 and $200,000.</p> <p>Romney's budget plan would also make the federal tax-and-transfer system considerably less progressive, thereby worsening income inequality, which is already at its highest level since the Great Depression. Rising income inequality fuels a growing opportunity deficit for children born into poor and middle-income families, reflected in disparities in educational attainment by family background, and a decline in intergenerational mobility. Under Romney, the opportunity deficit would widen, robbing the country of future talent and productivity.</p> <p>Romney has provided few details about his deficit-reduction plan. But, based on what he has revealed, we know that it would increase the jobs deficit, the investment deficit, and the opportunity deficit, with negative consequences for future growth and prosperity.</p> <p>\u2022 Laura Tyson, a former chair of the US president's Council of Economic Advisers, is a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.</p> <p>\u00a9 <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/\" title=\"\">Project Syndicate</a> 1995\u20132012</p>",
  "<p>Well as you can see I am a lot shorter than people might expect. Television exaggerates people's heights so to give you some idea of my actual height take my measure against this podium here. This podium is one foot high, so that gives you an idea. Thank-you very much, Bafta, for your incredible kindness in not only inviting me to give this year's Television Lecture, but of laying on such a magnificent parade through central London leading up to it. I know how deeply the British public share our concerns about the digital future and the challenge of multi-platform delivery, which is why I'm sure they turned out in the large numbers they did this afternoon.</p> <p>Now, my predecessor in this spot, Peter Bennett-Jones, argued last year that the BBC needs to be split into two divisions, one factual, and one entertainment. Indeed, many in the crowd in Trafalgar Square were telling me the same today \u2026 and I'll be taking Peter's advice tonight, and speaking just about comedy and drama, since that's what I feel qualified to discuss. I also ought to point out that Peter is my agent so I suppose it's appropriate he gets a 10% share of my argument this evening.</p> <p>But I dedicate tonight's lecture 100% to him. He's been my mentor and model for nearly 20 years now, fighting to help me make the comedy I wanted to make under the creative conditions I needed to make it, and his generosity, idealism and idiosyncrasy for me represent totally what we are in UK Television when we are at our best. Especially the idiosyncrasy.</p> <p>This lecture has the rather aggressive title of 'Fight, Fight, Fight'. And to show I mean business, I also ought to warn you that I use the F-word three times this evening, and by that I mean 'Fuck'. And that was one of them.</p> <p>I had originally thought of calling tonight's talk 'Make Good Programmes' and the plan was to be introduced, come over to the lectern and say, 'Good evening. Make good programmes' and then sit down again. But that would only have led to an awkward silence, followed by everyone heading downstairs to a glass of rather sharp-tasting white wine and then, with a free evening ahead of them, no doubt heading over to a rival talk Brian Sewell is giving on Titian at The National Gallery.</p> <p>But 'Make Good Programmes' is all I've ever believed, it's all I've ever want to believe. Don't underestimate the intelligence of your audience. Make good programmes, and they will come.</p> <p>My only working principle, whenever we make something, is rather ruthlessly to concentrate on that rectangular screen on the monitor as I'm filming. What's happening in that screen? Is it clear what's going on? Is what's in that monitor the funniest, the best it can be? Is it telling the story? Is it believable what those people are saying? And I will always fight to make it so, even if that means starting afresh, rewriting the scene, dropping an extremely expensive prop, ignoring a magnificent but distracting view the location manager sold his wife to get access to.</p> <p>All of that, because that rectangle is all the viewer cares about too. Whatever device that rectangle is on may keep changing, away from the home and onto the tablet, but it's still those same four sides enclosing what you've made. It's an intimate connection between you and them. There may be a hundred people on set, we may measure our reach in terms of millions, but ultimately people watch in ones and twos, and with families and friends. TV is personal.</p> <p>It's personal for me. When I was growing up in Glasgow my father was self-employed, and had good times and bad times. In the good times, we lived in a nice house, but there were bad times. There was a particularly bad time when there were six of us in a two-bedroomed tenement flat in Glasgow. But even then, I remember television taking us out of ourselves. Us all gathered round and there being laughter, at Morecombe and Wise and The Generation Game and Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em. But also great illumination, with the likes of The World at War and Horizon and a fantastic series I remember dramatising Charles Darwin's voyage on the Beagle to the Galapagos Islands, where he began his intellectual journey that was to lead to the development of his theory on evolution.</p> <p>I personally felt grateful that British TV set itself apart from its international rivals in this way, not afraid to challenge, to stretch the mind and imagination. It stretched mine, it galvanised my creative ambitions, it gave me a standard to reach for, which is why I feel happy making television, and grateful and thankful that I'm making it in Britain.</p> <p>That's why I've called this talk 'Fight, Fight, Fight', because I want to encourage us to be more aggressive in promoting what makes British TV so good. And to be ambitious, arrogant even, in how we sell it to the world. Never to sell ourselves short. And I'll be talking about my American experiences in a moment. But commercially, I want us all, especially the BBC, with a brand recognition up there with Apple and Google, to go abroad and prostitute itself to blue-buggery if need be in how it sells and makes money from its content, so that money can come back to production in the UK.</p> <p>But more importantly, at home, I want us to be more vocal in fighting whatever attacks or restricts our creative ambition. The caution, the assault from politicians and press barons, the unnecessary constraints imposed by any executives who commission in their own image, according to their own agenda of tastes and priorities, instead of in creative engagement with the programme makers,</p> <p>I want to banish forever the memory of a seminar a few years back, where a roomful of some of the best comedy writers in the country were told by executives, 'here's some of the topics we're looking for in comedy \u2026 Builders, women \u2026. No doubt they were inundated with scripts about a building firm who wanted to build a woman. I want to argue that programme makers, the creative industry in television, is its hugest asset, and will be the true source of any profit to come, and needs to be treated with respect and support.</p> <p>Now, profit, the weasel word, profit. I'm not a naturally aggressive person, but one of the few times I've spoken out in public about television was after James Murdoch spoke up in favour of profit, and attacked the BBC for being far too good. I was frustrated that the BBC started apologetically looking at reining in some of its services, and apologising for having websites and digital channels and local radio. And at the time I said publicly I loved the BBC dearly but I was frustrated that, every time it was accused of a crime, even one it wasn't guilty of, it would immediately hand itself in to the nearest police station. I also said the BBC should get someone to tell James Murdoch to fuck off, but it looks like that happened at the most recent MacTaggart Lecture [which was given by James' sister Elisabeth Murdoch].</p> <p>Now, it would take someone with a sick and twisted sense of humour to revel in the subsequent emotional distress that has befallen James Murdoch since he made that argument, which is why Bafta has asked me to give this lecture.</p> <p>But I want to look at that provocative remark he used at the end of his MacTaggart Lecture, that 'the only reliable, durable guarantor of independence is profit,'. That sentence riled me. It got to me. Not just because my first instincts were telling me it was the opposite of everything I believed, but also because of a niggling, troubling little emergency flare that went off at the back of my mind that perhaps there might be something in it. That independence is key. That creative independence is what defines British television at its best, but if it's under attack, where is it to go if not into the arms of the moneymen?</p> <p>Well, we'll see.</p> <p>So let's, first, take a look at the world stage. British television was once the most admired, the most copied and influential in the world. I say 'once' because I think over the past five, maybe 10, years we've stopped thinking that. We've been surprised and gob smacked by how good American telly has become.</p> <p>Bringing cinema production values to the small screen and attracting cinema talent. America's best writers and directors have been enticed to the longer-form TV drama and as a consequence have given us the likes of The Wire, Damages, The Walking Dead, Six Feet Under, Homeland, and Game of Thrones. Some of these series have been called the greatest television ever made. Which is silly, because that's Breaking Bad. Or is it Family Guy?</p> <p>My epiphany was when watching an episode of Battlestar Gallactica, not the '80s mullet version, but the high concept reboot from a few years back, where some of the central cast \u2013 held in captivity by the Cylons \u2013 resorted to suicide bombing to overthrow them. For an American show deep in America's War on Terror, this was an astonishing piece of bravado from the programme makers, and it made me sit up and think about how gloriously daring we could be with television drama.</p> <p>But American TV wasn't always to that standard. In the 1970s and '80s, that time when perhaps America's political and cultural dominance was at its height, and when Britain's great doubts about its identity and role were at their most pronounced, in those times we at least consoled ourselves with one unarguable, self-evident fact; American TV was glittery crap and ours was really, really good. Yes, there were iconic shows from the US like Kojak and The Mary Tyler Moore Show, but these were just well made entertainments at the very tippy-topmost peak of a mound of dross.</p> <p>We rejoiced in the vulgarity of their LA sheen, we enjoyed being appalled by the sausage-factory productivity, with regular, yearly seasons of 22 episodes or even more, typified by a famous Simpson's episode where Homer raises money to fund a new, seventh episode of his favourite British TV show,</p> <p>And we jumped up in down with barely concealed patronising glee that even a costume soap from us like Upstairs, Downstairs could be repackaged in America as Masterpiece Theatre. And we laughed, oh how we laughed, at their repeated attempts to take top quality British sitcoms like Fawlty Towers and make a complete shredded turkey out of them.</p> <p>And then, with The Sopranos we started identifying the appearance of quality, edgy television. We identified it with HBO. We maybe saw it as a one-off. After all, HBO's slogan 'It's not TV , it's HBO' reinforced this notion that what we were watching was somehow an exception. But now as rivals Showtime and AMC and FX ape HBO's commitment to a different type of television, with the likes of Mad Men and Dexter, and as the big networks catch the bug with high-concept shows such as Lost and, dammit, The Office, I think in Britain TV has gone through something of an identity crisis.</p> <p>Why is this? Firstly, I think the increasing power and dominance of the commissioning executive (and by that I mean either genre commissioner or channel controller or scheduler \u2013 an executive who has some say in the commissioning of programmes) I think the increasing power and dominance they've had is partly to blame for this. Separating broadcasters from programme-makers gave those broadcasters a power that has grown and grown so that at times it becomes a form of diktat as to what the content should be.</p> <p>\"We want a animated sketch show about teenage car crash victims\"; \"We're looking for more dramas about superhero weathermen fighting permafrost\"; \" We're after a sassy late-night antiques show\"; \"We want a multi-ethnic quiz hosted by an Indian Amanda Burton.\"</p> <p>Too often, the commissioning executive became the chief creative officer behind any show, the one coming up with the title, insisting on the key cast, determining the format, imposing hard-line notes on the script, influencing the edit. Very often the producers and key creative talent became the suppliers, the contracted creative labour, used to bring the commissioner's project to completion.</p> <p>We were told we, the programme makers, were there to make headlines, grab ratings, pull in the viewers, or 'punch through the mix' as I remember one memo put it. The discovery that reality was popular and cheap let to a downturn in drama and comedy, and an upswing in that colossally twattish decade of programmes that described their entire contents in their title. Top Ten Celebrity Mingers, remember that? The Boy Who Can Burp His Own Kidneys. Help Me, My Sister's a Pope.</p> <p>Apologies if you've heard this before, but I just think it typifies what was going on. I worked for Talkback, which was a comedy company, but then became much more successful making reality shows, and it produced House Doctor \u2013 one of its hits. Someone working at Talkback had decided that they were going to leave, and it was a brainstorming session for spin-off ideas from House Doctor. People were chucking in Garden Doctor, people were saying: 'Garden Doctor, fantastic, people go into gardens, do them up, sell them, improve the house'. School Doctor: 'fantastic, people go into schools, they turn them round, whatever'. Body Doctor: 'fantastic, people go in and \u2026' at which point my friend, who was about to leave, stood up and said 'that's a fucking doctor'. Now, thankfully, the worst of those days are behind us but I do think we still expend too much of our energy trying to second-guess what the executives are after.</p> <p>In comedy, for example, the agenda kept changing with a set of circular twists and turns more dizzying than the ones that got our gymnasts a bronze at the Olympics. Commissioners and controllers saying there's too much single camera comedy on these days and they want some more studio audience sitcoms.</p> <p>And then along comes Gavin and Stacey, which proves the audience sitcom is dead so we don't need any more thanks. And then along comes Miranda and the appeal goes out once more audience sitcoms just like that. And then along comes The Inbetweeners.</p> <p>It seems to go in cycles of four years. And yet controllers and commissioners seems to come and go every two years, so the cycle gets disrupted by another cycle inside the bigger cycle, until no one knows what we're meant to be making and everyone is just sick.</p> <p>I honestly don't think that this was the commissioning executive's fault; it was more a symptom of the dysfunctional nature of the job. Pressure on that exec to get the commission right, to get the ratings and the awards and the conversational buzz, against all competition. And that inevitably pushes them into wanting final say on all aspects of the programme. The more they have their say, however, the less say there is from the creative team.</p> <p>On top of all this, because drama and comedy is so expensive to make, I think there grew up a tendency to think, we were lucky to be making it at all. It was a 'beggars can't be choosers mentality' that gave the broadcaster the upper hand in dishing out notes and casting suggestions and schedule deadlines. It made it easier to say no without too much explanation. 'Sorry, we've already got a show set in a county with cars in it.'</p> <p>That's the nature of the dysfunction: it diminishes the use of the greatest resource in British Television, the fund of creative talent of writers and performers and producers, who made the greatest television in the world. The more limitations and constrictions we impose on that talent, the more British television is diminished.</p> <p>If we operate under a culture of caution and compliance, our TV industry will not flow at full strength, at a time when it has to. I've been lucky enough to have had several chances of working with American broadcasters, and I've had contrasting experiences.</p> <p>There was a US Version of The Thick of It, which was piloted at ABC, and there I saw first-hand the network system. The notes from every executive, meetings with a roomful of vice-presidents laid out in crescent formation in swinging chairs. Every decision on casting, location, the look, even the colour of the ties, (although I was allowed to have final decision on that one), but every other decision needed approval and sign-off from above.</p> <p>Then flash forward three years and my experiences making Veep with HBO. There, the conversations were direct, focused. Most heartening, the whole experience was about forming a creative relationship, a dialogue, with the programme maker. Their first words to me were, 'we like what you do, why would we want to change it?' Yes, there were notes and talks, but these were always supportive suggestions. If there was ever a difference of opinion over a decision, word would always come back: 'it's your show. It's up to you,'.</p> <p>That's an extraordinary contrast, and it's tempting to conclude that the big networks just aren't the place to go to do the type of shows that we make here, the idiosyncratic personal stuff, the typically British stuff. But I think that's wrong. Good stuff is made by the networks and the mistake in the end was ours for thinking that, though we came up with the programme idea, we weren't best equipped to make it ourselves. We didn't big ourselves up enough in the process. In fact, as my experience with Veep has borne out, confidence in our own ability pays dividends. Veep, though shot in America, with an American cast, has an all-British team of writers, all-British directors, all-British post-production from start to finish \u2013 titles, music, editing. The cast even came to London to rehearse.</p> <p>It's a lesson I need to hold on to, it's one I've learnt. That we can make international television, but we need to make it our way because we have all the advantages of belonging to the best creative pool of talent in the world. The US comes to us for ideas because we have great ideas, but we are also the best equipped to make them.</p> <p>For me, Veep is a start, but it signals that it's possible, just possible, to enter not just a financial partnership with other countries, but a creative one as well. And we need to, because the market has become global, the potential audience, truly international.</p> <p>I want to break off ever so briefly to show you a clip, I was thinking \u2013 given that we're in the height of election fever over in the States \u2013 it would be good to see something funny about the American election and I scoured around various channels and networks and websites, and the thing that's made me laugh consistently is this clip, which is fairly self explanatory. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L9A1IMTQo\" title=\"Spoof Mitt Romney YouTube clip\">So if we just watch this, and we'll talk about it afterwards</a>.</p> <p>There are three things I wanted to say about that clip, and I'll say them very quickly. I could actually do a whole lecture. Firstly, it was done on the internet, so nobody commissioned it, someone went and did it off their own bat. And that's an example of how the internet has given us creative tools to write, to create, to film, to test out ideas.</p> <p>It means that, whereas 20 years ago people were saying to me 'how do I start? How do I get into comedy?' and I would say to them 'well, you'll have to go along to a radio production, go to a writers' meeting of Weekending and see if you can write for that,' or 'have you got a script?'. Nowadays, people are giving me CDs and DVDs and web links, and the ability to create off your own bat means that actually there's now no excuse, if you want to become a member of the creative industry within television, there is now nothing stopping you in terms of going out and being able to enact your ideas. Now, obviously, some things take a little bit of money, and need a little bit of support and financial backing. But the ability to grab people, especially if what you make is good, I think is now greater. Secondly, that clip was made in the US, but I can access if here.</p> <p>The fact is that domestic audiences are becoming less and less attached to watching stuff made in their homeland, less and less attached to watching home-grown television. Are more ready to watch, no matter where it's made. For that reason British comedy is now far more popular in America than it's ever been, because people know where to access the stuff.</p> <p>They know where to find Inbetweeners and Peep Show. We just started, this week, The Thick of It has gone out in the UK, but it's now simultaneously going out on Hulu in America. We, in the UK, aren't too fazed by watching Nordic drama, we're not actually that fussed by where it's made, as long as it's good. And that's an interesting thing.</p> <p>Thirdly, I can watch that whenever I like. This removes the art of the scheduler, since scheduling becomes a personal gift to the viewer, who watches whatever they like. And I think, especially watching how the young view their television, or rather view content on YouTube on their laptop, on their phone, and have this expectation that they can access anything from anywhere in the world, and at any time they want it, I think that this inevitable revolution in viewing habits that people are frightened of is going to come upon us in the next three, four years.</p> <p>What that means, though, is that content is supreme. That the programme commissioner, the scheduler, the controller has less of a vital job and that the responsibility for coming up with good stuff is back with us. Across the world, the cry is up for content. People want good stuff, and they'll search anywhere to find it. Schedulers, networks are on the wane, and the makers of good stuff will be in the driving seat.</p> <p>And that's why it's great we belong to the best creative industry in the world, but also why it's essential that everyone, executives and producers, in British television prioritises good quality, challenging, imaginative programming because it's only by doing so will we play to our strengths and stand out from the competition.</p> <p>We are at our best not in committee, but when we're at our most idiosyncratic. The best British television is the vision of individual creative minds, responding to the values and events of the society around them. But it's not self-absorbed, it's genuinely part of the wider spirit of what's going on in a community, but a specific response to that spirit. It's a challenge, or a celebration of it, or a critique of it or an affirmation of it. Because it's individual, because it's personal, it communicates, it connects with the viewer. Commissioning executives are at their best when they give space and encouragement to these individual responses. When they fund, and nurture and guide Graham Linehan, Adam Curtis, Nira Park, John Lloyd, Steven Moffat, Charlie Brooker, Julia Davies, Iain Morris, Simon Cowell, Jon Plowman, Shane Meadows, Aardman Animation, and hundreds more like them, producers and writers, many of whom are not household names, but who have a consistent passion for striking ideas, all part of the collective and exceptional TV talent in the UK.</p> <p>I personally will always be grateful to Roly Keating when as Controller of BBC Four, he listened to my rather back-of-an-envelope description of what a fuzzy, semi-improvised, quickly shot, ensemble political comedy might be like and then gave me \u00a3200,000 and said, 'see what you can make with this,'. We made the first three episodes.</p> <p>And I think also something like the recent Star Gazing Live on BBC2, the astronomy show stretched nightly across a single week, was an example of great, creative commissioning, where time and space, literally, was entrusted to a group of individuals and experts, at a risk it could all fall flat, but given encouragement and profile \u2013 and in the garnering, great viewing figures and rewards.</p> <p>The best commissioners don't work over creative production, but alongside it. They don't stare down at what's on their desks, but look up and see what talent is there in the room and how it can be stretched and challenged and inspired to think about the best way to fill that rectangular screen in the corner. Look at the Olympic opening ceremony. There was the commission, 'let Britain show the rest of the world what it is now,' and it was entrusted to one man, Danny Boyle, to feel free to flesh it out. It was quirky, entertaining, and insightful. It didn't please everyone. My favourites exchange was from the Tory MP Aidan Burley who tweeted it was 'multi-cultural crap' and a reply from @paulsinha who tweeted back, 'if you think the ceremony is multi-cultural, wait till you see the sport,'.</p> <p>But I think we got some sense of the energy and passion that went into that ceremony: it was a clear creative vision, and so it connected. Just imagine what would have happened if that same brief, 'show the world what Britain now is,' was instead given to a committee. If there had been boxes to tick, content to pick off.</p> <p>Well, we don't need to imagine, because we all remember the Millennium Dome Exhibition. When the government, the chief commissioner, decided the thing was too important to be left to mere creatives. So it thought it could determine the content, which was why the section in The Body Zone on creativity was a brain on a stick telling Tommy Cooper jokes.</p> <p>Which mindless image brings me neatly onto the subject of politicians. Another reason British television has felt so disarmed, confused as to what it's for or where it should be going, is because of the consistent, cack-handed, interference from politicians, goaded by the press, and the rather supine and scared way the broadcasting executives have failed to fight back, too scared to face the rebuke of the press headlines.</p> <p>Governments, whether right or left, have become the commissioners in chief, nudging and cajoling the networks into their preferred business models without the slightest sensitivity or awareness of what the British public wants from its television service, or what the British TV industry is capable of.</p> <p>Now, it's all too easy to portray the average politician as a policy-wonk fed since the age of 14 on position papers on social policy and party outreach, professionally married to the job, ascetically weaned day and night on the company of his or her fellow party workers and political researchers, never seeing daylight, never watching telly, never having any cultural development outside whatever serves their policy purview.</p> <p>This would be all too easy a caricature. But it would also be accurate. Because that's what career politicians are like. By career politicians I mean those politicians who have worked the system well enough to gain office. They have no idea what the average member of the public culturally consumes because they are not average members of the public. They are specially bred adminadroids legislabating into an empty chamber and who experience everything through the matrix of their own political blueprint for Britain. Or, put simply, they don't watch much telly.</p> <p>The recent Leveson inquiry has thrown up many things, including the testimony of the late Jeremy Hunt. It's interesting to notice that although people criticise the fact that we now have a transport secretary who's scared of flying and an equalities minister who's against gays, nobody has picked up on the fact that a man a lot of people want to see dead is now health secretary.</p> <p>As we all remember, Jeremy Hunt was a firm supporter of the News Corp takeover of BskyB, writing a letter to the prime minister early in 2010, before he'd been decide to wave it through. In that letter of advice, in November 2010 , Hunt wrote: 'James Murdoch wants to repeat what his father did with the move to Wapping and create the world's first multi-platform media operator available from paper to web to TV to iPhone to iPad. The UK has the chance to lead the way on this as we did in the '80s with the Wapping move. If we block it our media sector will suffer for years'.</p> <p>No reference here to content, nothing about what this will mean for the British viewer, what form of programming it will unlock; what benefits it will bring to our viewing experience; how culturally it will have impact; what opportunities it will present to the creative industry. Nothing. Just a dry analysis of the cash nexus behind a digital strategy.</p> <p>It's a lack of imaginative engagement that, coming from someone who went on to become culture secretary, I find quite chilling. But it's typical I think of how the political class view us. We are there to be badgered if we don't conform to their message, if they feel we haven't represented their side of the story well enough, or we are there to be bullied if we stray from their economic overview of what a broadcasting industry should do. If they feel it's too downmarket; too upmarket; too expensive; not investing enough; too leftwing; too rightwing; too London-centric; spending too much money on outsourcing to the regions; not attracting key talent; spending too much on key talent. I say bullying because I do feel politicians, goaded by newspaper editors, have seen broadcasting, and particularly the BBC, as an easy target.</p> <p>But now is the time to fight back. There's a perfect alignment of the stars in favour of the creative forces behind television in the UK. It won't last, so now's the time to strike. The Leveson inquiry has highlighted public misgivings about how our politicians and the press operate, but also the events of the summer have given us a reminder of what the public actually values about British cultural life.</p> <p>In much the same way there was a pride at the celebration of the NHS in that opening ceremony, I think there's a growing recognition that the BBC, and indeed, the UK's wider commitment across channels to public service broadcasting, has given us the very best television available.</p> <p>The public will now never forgive anyone who meddles with British TV for political advantage or to further their own economic agenda. With a new director general there couldn't be a better time to reset the board, and signal that we're just not going to take that kind of interference any more. That we are proud, we relish our idiosyncrasy in television, that it defines our greatness, and that to diminish it is to sterilise our ambition. The facts now prove it.</p> <p>When ITV regions were sold off to the highest bidder, and we ended up with the likes of Carlton (for whom, incidentally David Cameron did the PR) then ITV suffered the consequences in declining viewers, and reputation. This it's now rebuilding, through a commitment once again, to quality drama and distinctive, idiosyncratic programmes.</p> <p>As Sky realises it's extended as far as it can, the number of subscriptions it can pick up through sport and movies, it's had to commit to finding a whole new type of subscriber, one who's looking for that quality, that high-end production values and scripted ambition that we used to associate with British TV, but which we now recognise in America.</p> <p>And so it's ploughing a fortune into new production, big new dramas and new comedy. It's establishing relationships with theatre companies, and opera groups and book festivals that others can only dream of. We should be willing this venture to succeed. For years we've been arguing that Sky makes all this money and it should use it to fund original content, so I think it's cheap and churlish point scoring to ignore them or want them to fail. But, the challenge now is for Sky to hold its nerve. Some shows won't rate, the money can't last forever. If it really wants to make its mark, it's now got to find the new talent, engage with the young writers, find the next comedians and actors and show it can take risks with them as well. The reward for us will be that there is a genuine hunger and competitive fight among broadcasters for the best new drama and comedy.</p> <p>If we can demonstrate that good programmes actually do mean good business, then we've arrived at a truly creative marketplace where there's a genuine fight for content, a fear that the best might be going elsewhere if you don't snap it up.</p> <p>That dramatically shifts the focus back to us, the programme makers, to come up with more, new, startling ideas, absolutely unmissable storylines and settings, the sharpest writing. The commissioners will have to put more work into establishing relationships with key talent, cajoling, encouraging them to feel confident that once again they've found a home for their work.</p> <p>This is the one profound impression I brought back from my work at HBO. That, actually, its business model is now inextricably bound up in its claims for originality and the close relationships it forms with programme makers. That it makes money from new subscriptions, and it can only increase its subscriptions if more and more people know they're paying to get something different from their usual fare. And that can only happen if HBO keeps coming up with programmes that are more daring, or funnier, or more distinctive than the competition.</p> <p>As a result, it makes a fortune, and can plug that back into production. It doesn't run commercials and actually isn't too bothered by individual ratings. Other networks are now copying them, like FX, Showtime and AMC. This way of making adventurous television is becoming the norm. It's why American TV at the moment is the place most creatives want to go. At HBO, I found a refreshing commitment to me, the programme maker, a culture of backing the creative.</p> <p>But here's the thing, what makes US television so good now, this commitment to us, is not new. For it's precisely what defined British television for decades. Our passion, our drive to make what felt different and adventurous, had been the hallmark of British television for 40 years. I like to think that, if it got lost recently, that was just a blip. That it hasn't been forgotten, and that once again the circumstances are slotting into place whereby it has to re-emerge and stay with us if we're to survive and then go on to re-take our position as the best TV makers in the world.</p> <p>And that blip, that period we've just come through, where programmes were filtered through charts and schedules and executive brain cells and imposed on a creative workforce, that is precisely the old-fashioned mechanics of the big American networks that HBO and company are fighting free of. Just as US TV was excelling by copying the values of British programme makers, so were British channels falling into the worse habits of committee-driven American network TV.</p> <p>I don't know what it's saying, but I wrote this speech on my iPad, which I bought when I was filming in America. So it must be on American settings, because every time I typed in BBC the autocorrect changed it to NBC.</p> <p>I genuinely believe that times are changing, that networks are waking up to the fact that viewers will leave them unless they can commission daring and original shows. That there is now genuine competition among them for the best talent, that the internet and the international viewing audience now mean programme makers can circumvent traditional channels and commissioners if they feel they're making no headway for them.</p> <p>I believe that we may be on the verge of a tantalising moment in television, where the more good programmes we make, the healthier the audiences and the revenue. It will represent a final and fitting twist to those words of James Murdoch. He said that 'the only reliable, durable guarantor of independence is profit.' Could it be that soon the only reliable, durable guarantee of profit is independence? Only we can prove whether that will be the case.</p> <p>It won't happen overnight. It does need investment, we should be more aggressive in selling our content overseas. The BBC should be more aggressive, all of television should, against the politicians and press barons who seek to tame it and rein it in. It's up to all of us to fight, fight to recapture first position with our ideas, but fight forcefully and loudly against all those who criticise what we do. We shouldn't be scared of offending, or portraying a multi-cultural nation, or pouring money into talent, or making shows that split opinion, that occasionally fail.</p> <p>We shouldn't be afraid of abandoning caution and market research, nor afraid to write and produce from the heart, out of passion. After all, what better way is there to connect with someone, than a fight?

As if pursuing greater equality and fixing the economy simply cannot happen at once.</p> <p>So I want you to hear it straight from me tonight: the idea that the two are mutually exclusive is utter rubbish. A nonsense this Coalition government will never bow to.</p> <p>For starters \u2013 we had 228,000 responses to our consultation on equal marriage. That\u2019s more than any other we\u2019ve found in the records. The next biggest was high speed rail, at just 50,000. Not everyone in those 228,000 will be pro, that\u2019s for sure. But you certainly can\u2019t dispute the strong feeling on both sides.</p> <p>And, even more importantly, whether equal marriage is being discussed around your kitchen table or not, it matters because it cuts to the heart of who we are.</p> <p>We have spent the summer witnessing Britain at it\u2019s best. The Olympics and Paralympics were wonderful not just because of the Team GB medal haul, but because \u2013 after decades of agonising over our national identity \u2013 they brought it into focus. We saw the forces of openness and tolerance reclaim the Union Jack. We showcased ourselves not as big and imperial and imposing, a nation constantly harking back to some bygone age. But as a nation that revels in its warmth; that is intelligent; diverse, generous and joyous; a nation able to own the future and lead the world because we have the right spirit, the right values, the right ideas.</p> <p>And of all those ideas, none can be more fundamental than the belief that people should be able to love whomever they choose; that we should let one another be, free from discrimination and able to enjoy the full equality that is each of our right.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-11T14:48:32.436Z\">at 3.48pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-504f4db1c0e312b4deaa481b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-11T14:43:43.155Z\">3.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It must be junior appointments day because Grant Shapps, the Conservative chairman, has just announced some vice chairmen jobs.

These hearings are supposed to perform an investigatory function, allowing MPs to find out what happened and why, but this morning Glenys Stacey, the Ofqual chief regulator, splatted the committee with gobbledygook. I certainly found it hard to follow what she was saying and, although it's quite possible that I was being dim, I did get the impression that members of the committee did not have a forensic understanding of what she was saying either.&#xa0;</p> <p>But it was not entirely hopeless. You always learn something during these hearings and today was no exception. Here are the main points.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Ofqual has admitted that it contacted two exam boards, Edexcel and WJEC, because it thought their English results were too high.</strong> Stacey said there was a particular problem with Edexcel.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Edexcel - the preliminary results were high. If the provisional results had been left to stand I think we were looking at 6% or 7% inflation and I suspect there would have been a different outcry had that been the outcome. They were certainly out of line with the other awarding body results.</p> </blockquote> <p>She said that Edexcel accepted Ofqual's demand for it to raise its grade boundaries. If Edexcel had refused, Ofqual could have forced it to comply she said.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Ofqual has said that it was surprised that schools had such high expectations for their GCSE English results this year.</strong> The point was made by Amanda Spielman, the Ofqual chair.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You might have thought that this year, in the first year of a completely different exam, schools would be a bit more cautious about their predictions and have brought them down a bit. I\u2019m not saying it is the schools\u2019 fault, I\u2019m saying school expectations were in a very different place. We would have expected in the face of a new specification to see schools being more cautious and what we actually saw was that school expectations for Cs went up by 2%.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Ofqual has said that further education colleges were hit particularly hard by the decision to toughen grade boundaries in GCSE English.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 Ofqual's chair has said that t<a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/gcses-will-be-regraded-for-pupils-in-wales--but-ofqual-refuses-to-reassess-the-grades-in-england-8122408.html\">he Welsh government decided to regrade its English papers</a> for political reasons.</strong> It was embarrassing for them to accept poor results, Spielman said.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Ofqual has said that it is wiling to release details of all its correspondence and calls with the Department for Education, including Michael Gove and his advisers.</strong> There was no political interference in its decision to toughen grade boundaries, Stacey said.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-11T11:46:34.334Z\">at 12.46pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-504f1bd858f94f441baa7a3e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-11T11:09:14.076Z\">12.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Times Educational Supplement has now published in full<a href=\"http://www.tes.co.uk/tesassets/images/resources/Ofqual_Edexcel_Documents_2012.pdf\"> the leaked letters (pdf)</a> that formed the basis of <a href=\"http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storyCode=6289695\">its story saying Ofqual ordered Edexcel to raise its grade boundaries.</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-504f1addc0e312b4deaa4803\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-11T11:05:02.140Z\">12.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ofqual submitted written evidence to the education committee before this morning's hearing. I have not seen it yet, but the Press Association has filed a story based on what it says. Here's an excerpt.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The GCSE English grading fiasco has had a \"serious impact on perceptions of fairness\", Ofqual admitted today. <br>The exams regulator said it recognised the significance of the issues faced this summer, and the impact of the \"generous\" results awarded earlier this year. <br>In a written submission to MPs, Ofqual also said that nobody could have seen that January's results were too generous, and that all the evidence pointed towards decisions being harsh. <br>And it insisted that there has been no political interference in the exams. <br>The submission, sent to the Commons education select committee ahead of today's evidence session, sets out Ofqual's investigation so far into this summer's GCSE English grading crisis. <br>It says that, in general, the awarding of modular GCSEs - in which pupils sit exams and submit coursework over a two-year period - has been successful. <br>But this was not the case with new modular English GCSEs, which were awarded for the first time this year. <br>\"We recognise the significance of the issues with GCSE English this summer: the generosity of the awards in assessments taken before June 2012 has had a serious impact on perceptions of fairness at qualification level,\" Ofqual said. <br>\"If we were not already planning to remove modular GCSEs after the current school year, we think there would now be a strong case for doing so.\" <br>Overall English GCSE results at grade C and above were down by 1.5 percentage points this year - in line with predictions. <br>But Ofqual adds: \"There has been an unusual distribution pattern, a greater variation between schools than expected. And for some schools the results are a far cry from their expectations.\" <br>The report says it is important to note that \"there has been no political interference\". <br>And it insists that the regulator played its \"proper role, regulating standards\". <br>\"Awarding in January and before was generous, but neither exam boards nor the regulators could have seen it at the time. <br>\"All the evidence at the time was that awarding decisions were if anything harsh.\"</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-504f19d7c0e312b4deaa4802\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-11T11:00:41.034Z\">12.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The hearing is over.

Low pay and poverty-level pensions are issues that require urgent ministerial attention. But this is not the argument I hear from Brighton. I hear indiscriminate arguments against a freeze on all public sector pay and in defence of all pension deals.</p> <p>I am wary of using personal anecdotes but while I was at the Edinburgh Festival I bumped into old friends in their early fifties with public sector pensions so generous that I cannot compete with their lifestyles. They were between foreign holidays, recommended lavish restaurants, enjoyed the theatres and good wine. One told me that she had been offered a pension only a few pounds lower than her monthly salary. It was too good to refuse. The drinks were on her, but I won\u2019t support strikes so that there will be many more drinks on people like her.</p> <p>Similarly, some in the public sector earn wages they do not deserve, with responsibilities so ill-defined they are lucky to get away with a pay freeze. They \u201cwork\u201d side by side with those who are appallingly paid and who work very hard.

This is not about replacing Lord Ashcroft\u2019s previous support to candidates in winnable seats. It is about supporting those same candidates with advice and counsel from seasoned campaigners about everything from harnessing social media and local media relations to how to build great campaign teams.</p> <p>Any political party needs to continue to adapt and learn. The Conservative campaigning operation has always been a force to be reckoned with, but we cannot \u2013 and must not \u2013 stand still. So we also want to help the party to develop new campaigning techniques and to learn from around the world.

It is a particular problem in the construction industry and is said to cost the Exchequer \u00a3350m a year.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On the issue of bogus self-employment, in the construction sector and more widely, I am determined that we look at this issue again.</p> <p>There is a careful balance to be struck. I do not want in any way to undermine genuine self-employment. But nor should contractual arrangements be distorted and misrepresented to avoid tax and undermine terms and conditions. It\u2019s not fair to taxpayers. And it\u2019s not fair to your members either.</p> <p>So I have asked the Shadow Chief Secretary, Rachel Reeves, to look again at the then Treasury's 2009 proposals for reform \u2013 abandoned by this government \u2013 and to consult employers, UCATT and the wider TUC to see if there is a better and fairer way forward.</p> </blockquote> <p>But the full speech seems more wide-ranging.

But the scale and scope is something that I\u2019m discussing with the chancellor at the moment.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also said he rejected pure laissez faire economics.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We do feel that although it\u2019s not the job of the government to direct industries \u2013 it\u2019s got to be private sector led \u2013 there is a role for government in supporting long term investment in research, in using procurement in a more strategic way, in supporting skills. Government has a role. Pure laissez faire is not the right way of doing things, very few countries would dream of approaching their industry in that way. We do believe in getting behind our success stories.</p> </blockquote> <p>I've taken the quotes from<a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com\"> PoliticsHome.</a></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-11T08:52:41.777Z\">at 9.52am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-504ef15fc0e312b4deaa47e8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-11T08:08:02.154Z\">9.08am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-515d845b-1940-4bdb-8677-1cd9afcdd07c\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2012/1/14/1326550185528/Shadow-education-secretar-007.jpg\" alt=\"Shadow education secretary, Stephen Twigg.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shadow education secretary, Stephen Twigg.

Here's the statement he put out overnight.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This latest revelation suggests that Ofqual did pressure at least one exam board to overturn their grades and treat pupils more harshly in June than in January. That simply is not fair. It seems to contradict what Ofqual said in its inquiry report that exam boards had set June's grade boundaries correctly \u2018using their best professional judgement\u2019.</p> <p>Michael Gove was warned by Ofqual of the unfairness of the approach in a letter in August, which said: \u2018it can make it harder for any genuine increases in the performance of students to be fully reflected in the results.</p> <p>Michael Gove continues to wash his hands of this whole fiasco. He should heed calls for an independent inquiry, and take urgent action to address this blatant unfairness.</p> </blockquote> <p>Last month Twigg was just asking for a parliamentary inquiry. On that front, he's got his wish - that's what I will be covering on the blog today - and now he has upped his demand.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-504eed1ec0e312b4deaa47e6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-11T07:49:54.690Z\">8.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>MPs on the Commons education are getting their teeth into the GCSE grading row this week. Tomorrow the committee will take evidence from Michael Gove, the education secretary, and this morning it is taking evidence from Ofqual, the exams regulator. To coincide with the hearing, <a href=\"http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storyCode=6289695\">the Times Educational Supplement has published an exclusive story saying that Ofqual ordered an exam board to raise its grade boundaries for English GCSE.</a> Here\u2019s an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>England\u2019s qualifications watchdog forced an exam board to make significant changes to GCSE English grades examiners had insisted were \u201cfair\u201d just two weeks before the publication of this summer\u2019s controversial results, TES has learned.</p> <p>Ofqual\u2019s intervention - which contradicts a key finding from its inquiry into the marking crisis - has prompted calls from a former Ofqual board member for chief regulator Glenys Stacey to resign, describing her position as \u201cuntenable\u201d.</p> <p>June\u2019s grade boundaries were correct and set by examiners \u201cusing their best professional judgement, taking into account all of the evidence available to them,\u201d Ms Stacey concluded when publishing Ofqual\u2019s inquiry report ten days ago. But letters between Ofqual and exam board Edexcel, seen by TES, reveal that examiners\u2019 professional judgement was actually overruled by the regulator.</p> <p>Ofqual ordered Edexcel to dramatically toughen up its English GCSE grade boundary despite strong protests from the board that its original decision was \u201cfair\u201d and backed by \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d. The last minute changes will have led to many pupils missing out on crucial C grades.</p> </blockquote> <p>I\u2019ll be covering the Ofqual hearing in detail.</p> <p>But there\u2019s lots of other politics around today too. Here\u2019s the agenda:</p> <p><em>8.30am:</em> David Davis and Liam Fox are among the Tories launching a new group, Conservative Voice. As Nicholas Watt reports, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/11/tory-group-cameron-detoxifying-values\">it will tell David Cameron to spend less time on modernising and detoxifying the Conservative brand and focus more attention on core Tory values if the party is to win the next election.</a></p> <p><em>10am</em>: Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, gives a speech to the TUC conference.</p> <p><em>10.15am:</em> Glenys Stacey, the Ofqual chief regulator, and other Ofqual executives give evidence to the Commons education committee about the GCSE grading row.</p> <p><em>10.15am:</em> Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Metropolitan police commissioner, gives evidence to the Commons home affairs committee about Olympics security. The committee is also hearing from Paul Deighton, Locog\u2019s chief executive, and Lord Coe, its chair, at 11am; from Charles Farr, director of the office for security and counter-terrorism at the Home Office at 11.45am: and from Nick Buckles, the G4S chief executive, at 12.30pm.</p> <p><em>12.30pm:</em> David Cameron and Owen Paterson, the new environment secretary, host an event marking 70 companies signing up to provide training and work placements for young people in the food industry.</p> <p><em>1pm:</em> Vince Cable, the business secretary, gives a speech setting out his industrial strategy. As Patrick Wintour reports,<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/10/cable-business-bank-industrial-strategy\"> he will say that the government will set up a British business bank.</a></p> <p><em>1.30pm:</em> Theresa May, the home secretary, gives a speech to the police superintendents\u2019 annual conference.</p> <p><em>2.30pm:</em> George Osborne, the chancellor, takes questions in the Commons.</p> <p>As usual, I'll be covering all the breaking political news, as well as looking at the papers and bringing you the best politics from the web. I'll post a lunchtime summary at around 1pm and another in the afternoon.</p> <p>If you want to follow me on Twitter, I'm at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewSparrow\">@AndrewSparrow.</a></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-11T08:56:49.435Z\">at 9.56am BST</time></p>  </div>"
