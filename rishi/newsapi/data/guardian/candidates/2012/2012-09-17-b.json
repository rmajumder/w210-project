  "<p>Occupy Wall Street's one-year anniversary began with early morning protests at New York's financial centre, but the demonstrations were marred by numerous arrests as activists marched around lower Manhattan.</p> <p>On 17 September 2011 hundreds had answered a call from Adbusters, the Canadian activist magazine, sparking demonstrations against failing financial systems and the influence of money in politics that spread around the globe. Thousands of protesters took to streets and encampments before high-profile police crackdowns in New York and Oakland signalled a lull that lasted through the winter and beyond.</p> <p>But Occupy protesters were determined to come out in force to mark the movement's birthday, with protests over the weekend set to culminate in Monday's encircling of Wall Street.</p> <p>People were gathering near Zuccotti park at 7am, and by 7.30am there were 300-400 people stationed opposite the famous former encampment, far fewer than in the movement's heyday, when more than 10,000 people regularly came out in support. It was a beautiful, warm September's morning, just like the days last autumn when protesters kicked off demonstrations that were reported across the globe. The nature of the protests were similar, too, as protesters attempted to \"shut down\" Wall Street, while their failure to achieve that goal also had a sense of deja vu.</p> <p>The group at Zuccotti Park was set to be one of four meeting points around lower Manhattan, with the separate demonstrations intending to surround the city's iconic financial centre.</p> <p>As it turned out, Wall Street remained open, although there was some disruption.</p> <p>A large police presence nullified protesters' attempts to access Wall Street, with officers arresting dozens of people in the early actions. A repeated theme of the detentions was police rushing forward to seize people identified as agitators. By about 5pm, 150 people had been arrested in New York, a significant number for demonstrations attended by comfortably fewer than a thousand people. At the end of the night, close to 200 arrests had been made.</p> <p>Only people with work ID cards were allowed on to the street, with financial workers, many disgruntled, having to negotiate the crowd.</p> <p>\"You know, I was just thinking it's getting a little tiresome,\" said one besuited man with a thick grey moustache. \"I just had to walk half a mile to get into my building.\"</p> <p>There were signs, however, that Occupy Wall Street still has mainstream support. \"I think they're exercising what everyone is feeling \u2013 even though we have to go to work we're still supporting what they're protesting,\" said 50-year-old Gabriel Adeniyi, who was watching the procession close to Wall Street, where he works as an underwriting specialist for a trust company.</p> <p>\"The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer.\"</p> <p>While people may empathise with the cause, however, there was a sense of frustration among some onlookers. One man who gave his name as Bill summed it up: \"They've been around, I have some sympathy, but their message is really unfocused.\"</p> <p>The game of cat and mouse with police was quite deja vu inducing, as protesters roamed the streets, changing course as officers appeared in front of them and being ordered to \"keep on the sidewalk\" repeatedly.</p> <p>After the morning's excitement, protesters retired to Bowling Green park in lower Manhattan, then Battery Park, in pre-planned moves, before eventually marching to Zuccotti Park, which was surrounded by barriers, but private security personnel were allowing people in.</p> <p>Once there, the celebratory aspect of Monday's events came to the fore as the \"drummers' circle\", which antagonised so many a local resident, was revived, while elsewhere a brass band and a lone bagpiper played. There were costumes too \u2013 a large, ghoulish Statue of Liberty that was a common sight in 2011, as well as a more topical \"Bain Capital\", a reference to Mitt Romney's former employers. The costume was based on the Batman comic book figure, outlandishly large with one particularly bulky hand labelled \"Mitt's fist\".</p> <p>Later in the afternoon there were marches from Zuccotti towards Wall Street, and more sporadic arrests, including the independent journalist John Knefel, whose detention was described as \"completely unprovoked\" by his journalist sister Molly Knefel. The detention of journalists again brought back memories of last fall, when the NYPD on occasion arrested journalists wearing NYPD credentials.</p> <p>This was a smaller protest than last year, however, and there was some frustration.</p> <p>\"Honestly? It's a bit dead,\" said Jefferson Moighan, who had travelled from an hour outside New York City to attend. Moighan was involved in Occupy in October and November 2011, he said, but his participation had dwindled since then, and he was unimpressed with both numbers and tactics.</p> <p>\"We planned too much in advance, so police know what we're doing,\" he said.</p> <p>Kevin Limiti, a 22-year-old from Long Island, was more optimistic, describing the day as \"extremely empowering\", but he too was frustrated by the actual nature of the protests. \"It's just hard to do anything with police up your ass. We don't seem like we get the chance to protest freely.\"</p> <p>There was common agreement among protesters, however, that there was still a need to draw attention to the kind of issues that brought people to the streets a year ago.</p> <p>\"Our problems aren't solved, our problems are plaguing our society,\" said Kanene Holder, an educator living in Harlem who has been a part of Occupy since the early days.</p> <p>\"The reason Occupy started was because our systems were so broken,\" she added, citing the influence of money in government following the Citizens United ruling, a common Occupy gripe. \"It doesn't matter how you protest your government, or demand what you think you deserve. Do it.\"</p>",
  "<p>Those who follow my writing know that I am <em>not</em> a fan of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/01/bias-polls-harry-enten\">weighting polls</a> to a predetermined party identification (ID). The reason is that questions on party ID can be skewed by question ordering and political environment. Many Republicans said, for instance, they were independents <a href=\"http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/elections/how_groups_voted/voted_76.html#.UFd8W79nFE4\">after the Watergate scandal</a>. Respondents may also be more likely to call themselves an independent instead of a Republican if they decide to cross party lines at an election.</p> <p>Some Republicans have been up in arms this year over what they perceive as polls with too many Democrats. The charge is not new. <a href=\"http://www.mysterypollster.com/main/2004/09/weighting_by_pa.html\">In 2004</a>, many Democrats complained of a bias: they thought the polls had too many Republicans. Why? Pollsters were finding that more voters identified as Republicans than usual. But it turned out that more voters in the <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/US/P/00/epolls.0.html\">exit polls</a> called themselves Republicans than in prior years \u2013 and George W Bush did win.</p> <p>The truth is that while some pollsters are unreliable, most know what they are doing. It's also important to remember that most media companies use bipartisan polling teams. <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/interactive/2012/09/12/fox-news-poll-obama-tops-romney-in-post-convention-poll-most-say-country-still/\">Fox News</a> has both a Democrat and a <a href=\"http://shawresearch.com/shaw/Bio.html\">Republican pollster</a> on their team. They found President Obama up by 5 percentage points. Are they biased?</p> <p>NBC News/Wall Street Journal has given Obama <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/30/race-2012-election-more-demagogics-demographics\">the advantage</a> in every one of their polls. Did you know that one of their pollsters is <a href=\"http://pos.org/about/partners-and-vice-presidents/bill-mcinturff-va/\">Republican Bill McInturff</a>, whose partner is Mitt Romney's pollster Neil Newhouse?</p> <p>Still, the party identification argument would be more sustainable if it made a big difference across pollsters: that is, if pollsters who had more Democrats than others were more Democratic, while those with more Republicans were more friendly to the GOP. To that effect, an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NumbersMuncher/status/246966493185728513/photo/1\">interesting graph</a> was published by Tweeter \"Numbers Muncher\". </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396287912\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/17/1347913964810/obamalead_460.jpg\" alt=\"Obama's lead by party ID\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The graph is supposed to show that the more there are survey respondents who identify as Democrats, the bigger the Obama lead. Your eye is probably drawn to the relationship between Rasmussen (at bottom left) and every other pollster. Join the dots, and you would seem to have found a fairly straightforward relationship: more Democratic-identified respondents giving a more pro-Obama poll result.</p> <p>You can explain about 45% of the difference in Obama's lead and the percentage difference between Democrats and Republicans in the sample. That's a solid, though not overwhelming relationship. It suggests that the number of Democrats in one sample can help predict whether or not the poll is going to be more Democratic than a poll done by another outlet.</p> <p>The problem is that the relationship is being driven by one datapoint. Take Rasmussen out of the chart, and you get this graph:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396287913\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/17/1347914038711/partyID_460.jpg\" alt=\"Obama lead v party ID\" width=\"460\" height=\"256\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>All of a sudden, the relationship that seemingly was there, no longer is. The explanatory power of party ID, therefore, is essentially zero. The pollster that has the most favorable Romney numbers gives Democrats a 10-percentage point party ID advantage. If anything, you might try and draw a U-shape to connect the dots.</p> <p>A truly real statistical relationship should not be dependent on one datapoint. Adding the newly released <a href=\"http://argojournal.blogspot.com/2012/09/poll-watch-monmouth-university-2012.html\">Monmouth University poll</a> continues to prove a lack of a relationship.</p> <p>The truth is that if you dig deep enough, you can find many causes for \"house effects\" (that is, differences between pollsters). This year, Democrats and some analysts <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/30/race-2012-election-more-demagogics-demographics\">have complained</a> about the racial composition of polling samples; I don't buy these racial arguments for the most part either. I only ask for individual pollsters to keep their own data consistent. A pollster shouldn't have a 35% Democratic-identified sample one time and a 25% sample the next, except when there have been changes to the electorate such as <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2012/09/12/obama-closes-enthusiasm-gap-with-romney-after-conventions/\">increased Democratic enthusiasm</a> after the Democratic National Convention.</p> <p>Now, none of this is meant to say President Obama will definitely win (more on that later in the week), but he <em>is</em> winning right now. That may be welcome news to some, but hard for others to accept \u2013 and I've seen that. Take it from someone who was among the first to call it that the Republicans would take over the House in <a href=\"http://poughies.blogspot.com/2010/02/republican-blizzard-on-generic-ballot.html\">2010</a> and hold it in <a href=\"http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/hje2011102702/\">2012</a>; not everyone wanted to hear this.</p> <p>I'm interested only in projecting the winner of this presidential election objectively. If there are those who prefer to cherrypick data to get a preferred outcome, that's their choice. But they're setting themselves up for a fall.</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney's campaign team is recalibrating its strategy amid signs of strife among his senior staff over Barack Obama's post-convention poll leads.</p> <p>In a tacit admission that the campaign's focus on harnessing disenchantment with Barack Obama is not working, Romney's team will attempt to give a clearer, more positive picture of their candidate as they seek to regain the initiative with just 50 days to go until the election.</p> <p>The new strategy will not abandon negative campaigning, but will focus on positive ads as well as speeches to spell out the Romney would pursue in office, in particular his five-point economic plan. </p> <p>In a conference call with reporters on Monday, Ed Gillespie, one of Romney's leading strategists, said the change in tack was driven because many voters were only now locking into the election and wanted to know about Romney's policies. \"We know people want to know more about the specifics. It is the time in the election cycle to do this,\" Gillespie said.</p> <p>As expected, the latest polls show Obama's large post-convention poll bounce beginning to narrow. A Gallup poll recorded a drop from 7% last week to 3%, with the president on 48% to Romney's 45%.</p> <p>Gillespie pounced on the Gallup poll as an indication that Obama's lead is narrowing, and claimed Romney and Obama were in a \"virtual dead heat\" in the swing states.</p> <p>But the problem for the Romney campaign is less Obama's post-convention bounce and more the fact that the Republican failed to secure any bounce at all. The campaign has also found itself persistently on the back foot, and the new positive message comes amid clear signs of trouble behind the scenes. </p> <p>On Sunday night, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0912/81280.html\">the Politico website reported in detail</a> on dissent from members of the team, with much of the criticism focusing on the running of the convention in Tampa and Romney's acceptance speech, which insiders say was a squandered opportunity to flesh out the detail of his plans.</p> <p>Romney began his campaign early in the summer intent on making the election about Obama's economic record and making himself as small a target as possible by disclosing little about his own policies.</p> <p>But since then there has barely been a clear week in which Romney has been able to get his message across, either because of a barrage of ads from the Obama campaign on Romney's record as chief executive of Bain Capital and his unwillingness to release more than two years' worth of tax records, or because of gaffes on his own side.</p> <p>Romney's trip to Britain, Israel and Poland, which was intended to showcase him as a figure of some standing in the international community, quickly went askew. His position on abortion became a week-long issue after Todd Akin, a Republican congressman in Missouri running for the Senate, talked about about \"legitimate rape\".</p> <p>Then, last week, Romney issued a hasty response to the evolving Middle East crisis, essentially accusing Obama of appeasement. His rash comment, from which many senior Republicans distanced themselves, dominated the news in the US for days after the killing of US ambassador Chris Stevens and the other three Americans, and the spotlight is only now beginning to turn to Obama's policy on the Middle East and North Africa.</p> <p>In the first sign of his campaign's new approach, the team released a new ad on Monday saying that Romney, as president, would help the working and middle classes by creating 12 million new jobs in the next four years. To do this, the ad says, Romney would balance the budget, cut the deficit, reduce spending, champion small businesses, and confront China over unfair trade practices.</p> <p>Economists say that the 12 million is slightly misleading in that this is basically the number of new jobs that will naturally be created as the economy recovers, rather as a result any action the federal government takes.</p> <p>Another ad is directed at Latino voters, a large demographic group that the Republicans have largely alienated through anti-immigrant rhetoric.</p> <p>The Obama campaign team described the new-look Romney campaign as \"an extreme makeover\" and mocked what it sees as the sudden attempt to appeal to Latinos.</p> <p>Much of the ire detailed in the Politico piece, coming from other members of the team in anonymous quotes, is directed at Stuart Stevens, Romney's leading strategist.</p> <p>The article described a long-time Romney friend as saying: \"The campaign has utterly failed to switch from a primary mindset to a general-election mindset, and did not come up with a compelling, policy-backed argument for credible change.\"</p> <p>Stevens is being overshadowed by Gillespie, a veteran Republican strategist and former chairman of the Republican party, who joined the team late, at the invitation of Stevens.</p> <p>Politico reported arguments over speech writers before the convention, with two drafts of the speech being commissioned and ditched just days before the event.</p> <p>Stevens, in interviews on Monday, played down the talk of internal dissent. Responding to the anonymous quotes about him, he told ABC: \"I never get mad at people who criticise.\"</p> <p>Stevens, who in the past has cautioned against hasty reactions when things have gone wrong for Romney, also noted that Obama's post-convention bounce was evaporating.</p> <p>Of the new-look strategy, he said that while the campaign would continue to focus on the ailing economy, it would become wider, encompassing foreign policy, the national debt and other issues.</p> <p>Romney's running-mate Paul Ryan was due to to make debt the central theme of a rally in Des Moines on Monday. Iowans have some of the lowest rates of credit in the country, making them particularly responsive to criticism of the size of the national deficit.</p>",
  "<h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jamesantle\">James Antle</a>: 'Problems with the conservative base limit his freedom'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396285838\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/06/02/james_antle_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"James Antle\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In a conference call with reporters Monday morning, the <a href=\"http://www.bostonherald.com/news/us_politics/view/20120917mitt_romney_looks_to_shift_direction_of_race/srvc=home&amp;position=recent\">Romney campaign said their candidate was getting ready</a> to release more detailed information about his plans to reduce the deficit and strengthen the middle class. As important as the plans themselves was the thinking behind this move.</p> <p>According to Romney strategist Ed Gillespie, the idea was to introduce the voters to Mitt Romney the man at the Republican National Convention. Now, as we are heading into the homestretch, Americans want to hear policy specifics from the candidates.</p> <p>This is interesting because Romney has built his campaign on several assumptions. The first is that voters wouldn't really be paying attention during the summer and would start to really focus on the race during the fall. Therefore, it was safe to allow the Obama campaign to outspend Romney 2-1 in several swing states \u2013 not counting assists from Super Pacs on both sides \u2013 and saturate the airwaves with ads, because nobody would watching. Romney would wait to open his wallet and launch his air attack when the voters were engaged.</p> <p>There's political science data that contradicts this theory, as does the recent example of John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign. Eight years ago, a shaky incumbent took to the airwaves early to define his little known and less liked challenger. Kerry never recovered. Romney is betting he'll be different.</p> <p>The second assumption is that the election will be almost entirely a referendum on Barack Obama's performance in office, and that the economy makes it very unlikely the president can be re-elected. This, too, carries risk. Romney has done relatively little to define himself or his campaign. Weak economic growth has occasionally been compatible with presidential reelection. And a large percentage of the American people still blame George W Bush for the economy. The recession didn't begin under Obama's watch, even if his policies haven't stimulated much of a recovery.</p> <p>Now Romney seems to be assuming that the remaining swing voters can be reached by filling them in on the policy details he has left fuzzy throughout the campaign. This may be due to a dent in Romney's tax advantage caused by the Obama campaign's assertions that the Republican's tax plan would raise the burden on the middle class. But there's little evidence \"low-information undecideds\" will suddenly be turned by learning how Romney would regulate energy or tweak marginal tax rates.</p> <p>The most valid of Romney's assumptions is that his problems with the conservative base limit his freedom of movement. He can't pivot \u2013 as he clearly would like to \u2013 on healthcare and immigration, and might also want to on abortion. By itself, this isn't a problem, since this is shaping up to be a base election. But it has limited Romney's ability to develop a critique of Obama that goes beyond the committed Republican voter, as evidenced even by his Cairo embassy statement.</p> <p>Internal campaign sniping aside, what Romney is left with is essentially hoping that anti-Obama sentiment is large enough to keep him within the margin of error. Then, on election day, undecided voters could break heavily enough to put him over the top. It <em>could</em> work; it could be a strategy for topping out at around 48% of the vote.</p> <p>But it doesn't seem like the ambitious pursuit of a mandate some conservatives expected when Romney tapped Paul Ryan as his running-mate.</p> <p><em>James Antle is editor of the Daily Caller News Foundation and a senior editor at the American Spectator</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/cheri-jacobus\">Cheri Jacobus</a>: 'Romney's Libya criticism could have been stronger'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396285839\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/1/3/1325610796868/cherijacobus_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Cheri Jacobus\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's reaction to the attacks and murders of American Consul to Libya Chris Stevens and several of his colleagues was not a faux pas, as Democrats and their cheerleaders in the media claim. In fact, his criticism could have been stronger for maximum impact.</p> <p>In 1980, when Iran held 52 Americans hostage, thumbing their nose at \"threats\" by President Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan sent a strong message that was unmistakable in its resolve: when Reagan became president of the United States, Iran's Ayatollah Khomeni would face the harsh reality of what a strong American president would do in the face of a hostage situation. Reagan was Carter's opponent in the election, and the incumbent president's weakness and impotence, and their danger to America, had developed into a key issue in the final weeks of the campaign. Carter, like Obama, also had failed domestically \u2013 on the economy, gas prices, and joblessness \u2013 and looked for others to blame.</p> <p>In September 1980, Carter was leading Reagan in the polls by 8 points. But in the face of domestic and foreign policy failures mirroring those of President Barack Obama today, the incumbent lost to Reagan on election day. America's choice for leadership was confirmed as the correct decision when Iran released the American hostages, just as Ronald Reagan was placing his hand on the Bible and being sworn in as president. While pro-Carter historians have twisted themselves into pretzels trying to implicate Carter as the man behind ending the hostage crisis, the facts speak otherwise.</p> <p>President Obama has proven to be weak-kneed, caving to Islamic extremists, including al-Qaida, by perp-walking an American film-maker out of his home for producing a film on Islam our enemies in the Middle East are falsely claiming as the reason for the anti-American riots and murders across the region. But the truth is beginning to haunt Obama, as we now know the attacks were planned, and the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/16/libyan-president-magariaf-military-action\">Obama administration was made aware of the impending doom</a>, but ignored the information and declined to share it with Ambassador Stevens and others.</p> <p>That President Obama chose to skip six days of security briefings during that period, and more than half in his presidency, sets him up for comparisons to failed President Carter \u2013 and for being held accountable for placing Americans overseas at risk. As it becomes apparent that President Obama misled the American public, and that Americans died as a consequence of his inaction, his presidency&#xa0;should be&#xa0;over.</p> <p>Yet the media seem to remain intent on protecting Obama, even in light of the danger his incompetence has proven to present.</p> <p>While most polls show Romney trailing Obama nationally, the most accurate from 2008, Rasmussen, shows Romney leading. However, Obama appears to have the edge in more of the key battleground states Romney needs in order to win. Despite overblown reports of the Romney campaign infighting, which nearly match recent stories about conflict among top Obama aides, the Republican nominee needs to be able to turn on a dime and fully address Obama's dangerous foreign policy \u2013 or rather lack thereof \u2013 while hitting Obama on the tanked economy, $16tn national debt, 23 milllion jobless, and Obamacare.</p> <p>In short, Mitt Romney needs to understand that the media is against him. He must not utter anything superfluous to his core message \u2013 eliminating the media's scope to focus on anything other than substance: they can't quote him on what he doesn't say. Romney's argument on substance versus Obama's lies and obfuscation will win the day.</p> <p><em>Cheri Jacobus is a Republican political strategist, pundit and writer</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/matt-lewis\">Matt Lewis</a>: 'Romney now needs strong debate performances'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396285840\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2011/4/7/1302195821539/mattlewis_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Lewis\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>If someone isn't comfortable in his own skin \u2013 if he doesn't really know who he is \u2013 everyone can tell. Campaigns are similar, and Mitt Romney's campaign has been looking self-divided lately.</p> <p>Despite a few flirtations with boldness (including the selection of Representative Paul Ryan as his running-mate), the Romney campaign always reverts to passivity. This is surprising and unfortunate, inasmuch as the boldness has usually worked. </p> <p>The strategy also seems to imply a belief in the (probably) false premise that a bad economy would automatically doom Obama \u2013 and that Romney could win by simply raising campaign cash, running perfunctory TV ads, and staying above the fray and under the radar. (Today, the theory that the 2012 election is solely a referendum on Obama seems quaint. But the Romney campaign might have been the last to notice.)</p> <p>This premise has manifested itself in various ways, including Romney's single-minded focus on the economy. Supporters call this \"message discipline\", but being elected president is about more than any one facet of political life \u2013 no matter how important that facet might be. Romney's Middle East comments last week were ill-timed, to be sure, but they were at least a recognition that the 2012 campaign is also about foreign policy, national security, and yes, even social issues.</p> <p>Interestingly, the notion that a Republican could win on the economy alone doesn't seem to jibe with history. Liberals can always promise more giveaways \u2013 a fact that can make them seem more appealing during tough economic times. Sure, Ronald Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter in 1980 because of malaise \u2013 but there was also the Iranian hostage crisis.</p> <p>To win, Romney must give voters a reason to vote <em>for him</em> \u2013 not just a reason to oppose Obama. He must present a coherent worldview that contrasts him with Obama's interrelated policies. It is important that we see his vision. And yes, there should be some specifics. The notion that he can skate by without providing details \u2013 that he can run out the clock and hope we don't check his homework \u2013 won't fly. </p> <p>There are three big moments in general election campaigns: The selection of a running mate, the convention, and the debates. In the next 50 or so days, Mitt Romney has to find a way to get his groove back \u2013 and this will clearly require strong debate performances.</p> <p>Despite the campaign infighting and ill-advised press conference during last week's Middle East turmoil, Mitt Romney can still win this election. Like a sports team on a losing streak things look bleak. But wining covers a multitude of sins.</p> <p>If Romney catches fire \u2013 which is still possible \u2013 his campaign problems suddenly look trivial. As they say, nothing succeeds like success.</p> <p><em>Matt Lewis is a senior contributor on politics to the Daily Caller</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jim-geraghty\">Jim Geraghty</a>: 'Just being \"Not Obama\" isn't going to be enough'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396285836\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/1/11/1326298456752/jimgeraghty_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Jim Geraghty\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>There are three changes the Romney campaign ought to make immediately.</p> <p>1) Enough with \"Obama isn't working.\" Yes, we know. It's obvious. No one needs to be reminded that unemployment is high. When you spend so much time repeating what everyone already knows, people begin to wonder if you really have that much else to say.</p> <p>2) The Romney campaign \u2013 Romney, most of his surrogates, and its ads and web videos \u2013 needs to connect the dots a lot more. If you watch Bill Clinton talk about a policy, there's a particular rhythm: first, here's the problem; second, here's what's causing the problem; third, here's what we're going to do; fourth, here's how it will work; and fifth, here's the result you'll see when it works. </p> <p>3) The campaign just needs to move <em>faster</em>: news cycles come and go without Romney managing to staple his agenda and ideas to the passing events. Last week would have been a golden opportunity to discuss what Romney really thinks of the Arab Spring: did America look at the uprisings in the region too optimistically? Is the Arab world ready for democracy, or is that just setting the stage for demagogues and/or Islamists? Have any of our public diplomacy efforts in recent years really paid off, or have they amounted to feelgood talk?</p> <p>And when Ben Bernanke and the Fed enacted QE3 last week, didn't that seem like a golden opportunity to showcase the Romney campaign argument about how the US economy is in a rut where all traditional methods of \"stimulus\" have proven disappointing? And how about the <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/campaign-spot/321107/scathing-fast-furious-ig-report-imminent\">expected upcoming release of the Department of Justice inspector general's report</a> on the \"Fast and Furious\" scandal? That's a perfect opportunity to make an address on the \"culture of unaccountability\" in Washington \u2013 found in the GSA (general services administration), as well as the DOJ \u2013 and how a Romney administration would fix that.</p> <p>Opportunities come and go. But the recent polling suggests that just being \"Not Obama\" isn't going to be enough this cycle.<br><em><br>Jim Geraghty writes the Campaign Spot blog for National Review Online</em></p>",

His plans were published in full<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2203826/Michael-Gove-New-rigorous-exams-abolish-GCSEs.html\"> in the Mail on Sunday yesterday</a> and the only significant new fact in the announcement was the name of the new exam, the English baccalaureate certificate. Gove said that changing the exam would enable English pupils to compete with the best in the world.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We plan to call these new qualifications - in core academic subjects - English Baccalaureate Certificates - recognising that they are the academic foundation which is the secure base on which further study, vocational learning or a satisfying apprenticeship can be built. Success in English, maths, the sciences, a humanities subject and a language will mean that the student has the full English Baccalaureate.</p> <p>Now some will argue that more rigorous qualifications in these subjects will inevitably lead to more students failing. But we believe that fatalism is indicative of a dated mind-set; one that believes in a distribution of abilities so fixed that great teaching can do little to change.</p> <p>And we know that great teaching is changing lives even as we speak. We have the best generation of teachers and headteachers we have ever had. Their excellence combined with reforms and improvements to education that this Government are making through improved teacher training, greater freedoms for head teachers and the growth of academies and free schools will mean more students will be operating at a higher level.</p> <p>So even as exams become more rigorous, more students will be equipped to clear this higher bar. Indeed, we are explicitly ambitious for all our children \u2013 and we believe that over time we will catch up with the highest performing nations and a higher proportion of children will clear the bar than now.</p> </blockquote> <p>Gove adopted a belligerent tone in his statement, accusing Labour of devaluing GCSEs by introducing modules and extending the use of coursework. But, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2162369/Michael-Gove-plans-scrap-dumbed-GCSEs-bring-O-Levels.html\">if the Daily Mail report from earlier this summer about his plans was accurate </a>(and no one is suggesting that it was not), Gove has retreated in some respects. The introduction of the new exam has been postponed and at this stage he is only proposing that pupils start studying for the English baccalaureate certificate in English, maths and science from September 2015; other subjects will follow at some unspecified point in the future.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Stephen Twigg, the shadow education secretary, has said that Labour will not support exam reform that does not benefit all pupils.</strong> Responding to Gove's statement in the Commons, Twigg said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The education leaving age is rising to 18, we need to face the challenges of the 21st century. But I simply don't accept that we achieve that by returning to a system abolished as out of date in the 1980s. Instead, we need a system that promotes rigour and breadth, and prepares young people for the challenges of the modern economy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Gove said that Twigg's comments showed that Labour was failing to embrace reform.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Teaching unions have strongly condemned the plans.</strong> Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, said: \"The secretary of state has embarked from the outset on a cynical and wholly unjustifiable attempt to discredit the quality and rigour of the GCSE qualification.\" And Christine Blower, the general secretary of the NUT, said Gove's approach was \"nonsensical\".</p> <p>That's it from me for today.

We need to raise the level of challenge in our Key Stage 4 qualifications to match the best in the world. Raising our expectations of attainment for all students will drive up standards as teaching and learning improve to <br>meet that challenge. High expectations are essential to creating a step change in standards and allowing us to keep pace with our international competitors.</p> <p>1.2. Our proposals will restore confidence by ending the perverse incentives created by the interaction of our qualifications and accountability system. At present, schools are incentivised to boost their performance by seeking examinations in which they believe their students may achieve higher grades, and Awarding Organisations have a corresponding incentive to compete for market share by <br>providing less demanding examinations.</p> <p>1.3. To remove that perverse incentive, we will move away from the competition between Awarding Organisations in the core academic subjects of English, mathematics, sciences, history, geography and languages. Instead of schools being able to choose between competing GCSEs in these subjects, a competition will be held to identify the best, single suite of qualifications in each subject offered by a single Awarding Organisation.</p> <p>1.4. We intend to use the school and post-16 accountability frameworks to incentivise schools and colleges to teach these new qualifications both at Key Stage 4 and post-16. Schools will start teaching new qualifications in English, mathematics and sciences from 2015, with students first entering the new exams in the summer of 2017. We will refocus the Department\u2019s floor standard measures which identify <br>underperforming schools to take account of performance in our new English, mathematics and sciences qualifications from 2017. The timetable for the introduction of qualifications in history, geography and languages, and the timetable for the introduction of English and mathematics post-16, will be determined following responses to this consultation.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-17T17:27:08.519Z\">at 6.27pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50574f9dc0e3d221b423ae85\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-17T16:28:15.120Z\">5.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The NUT has now issued its response to Gove's plans. Here an extract from <a href=\"http://www.teachers.org.uk/node/16543\">the statement from <strong>Christine Blower</strong>, the NUT general secretary.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is an inherent contradiction at the heart of Michael Gove\u2019s criticism of GCSEs. On the one hand the Education Secretary demands ever higher pass rates, yet when this is achieved, claims that it can only have occurred due to examinations becoming too easy. This is a nonsensical approach. Parents and carers know how hard their children work for GCSEs and how \u2018rigorous\u2019 the exams are. Ministers need to recognise that it is through sheer hard work and determination that pupils and teachers are achieving great results.</p> <p>What is being proposed here is blatantly a two-tier system. Pupils who do not gain EBacc Certificates will receive a record of achievement which will most certainly be seen to be of far less worth by employers and colleges.</p> <p>Placing a cap on those who can gain top grades means that many students will miss out on the recognition and opportunities they deserve and harks back to a time when only a few were expected to go on to higher education.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-17T17:11:57.417Z\">at 6.11pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5057465ec0e3d221b423ae75\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-17T16:18:05.780Z\">5.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's some Twitter comment on the Gove statement, which has just finished.</p> <p>From Labour's Liz Kendall</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/leicesterliz/status/247723105487843328\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Abolishing course work in qualifications except D&amp;T &amp; art is real mistake.

In each subject areas, only one board will offer the exam.</p> <p>The new qualifications will be called English baccalaureate certificates.</p> <p>Some say this will lead to more students failing.</p> <p>But, Gove says, that reflects a fatalist mindset.</p> <p>More students will be operating at a higher level, he says.</p> <p>Gove says the government is \"explicitly ambitious\" for all children. It expects pupils to do better. All students who do GCSEs will be expected to sit the new exam.</p> <p>Students who are not able to set the new exam could sit it at 17 or 18, he says.</p> <p>Teachers will start teaching for the new qualification in English, maths and science in September 2015.

Continuous assessment helps mitigate against the very many personal problems young adults begin to experience more frequently after they turn 16. Too often, teachers reading this will agree, have good pupils faltered at the last educational hurdle because of relationship, family, emotional or economic difficulties. Creating a one-off exam at the very end of studies cannot be said to accurately measure a student\u2019s ability in a particular subject. This change is devoid of compassion and shows how little Michael Gove understands the real world.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://ht.ly/dLo89\">\u2022 Fiona Millar at Local Schools Network says today\u2019s announcement should not overshadow a structural problem with the current exam system.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One fact that emerged last week has been perplexing me. Three pieces of evidence; the Ofqual letters to Edexcel leaked to the TES, the testimony of the Ofqual CEO to the Education Select Committee and the findings of the Welsh government\u2019s review into re-grading all focused on the role played by KS2 SATs results in the regulation of GCSE results. Education journalist Warwick Mansell as also written an extensive blog on this here.</p> <p>This statement on the Ofqual website summarises the situation. A prediction about GCSEs is made based on the KS2 results of the cohort in question. If that cohort exceeds expectations then the English exam regulator forces down the GCSE grades to bring them into line with predictions ...</p> <p>But if GCSE results are based on KS2 predictions, how can schools do what is expected of them in terms of the performance tables, RAISEonline and Ofsted? All these key measures of accountability rest on how well schools enable their pupils to make progress from KS2.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50572cfcc0e3eb823e694807\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-17T14:00:31.698Z\">3.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is from Greg Hurst, the Times' education editor</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GregHurstTimes/status/247693635578105856\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>So the new exams to replace GCSEs in core subjects are to be called the English Baccalaureate Certificate (EBC)</p>&mdash; Greg Hurst (@GregHurstTimes) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GregHurstTimes/status/247693635578105856\" data-datetime=\"2012-09-17T13:48:59+00:00\">September 17, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-17T14:58:07.445Z\">at 3.58pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50572caa58f9cf283191bdc1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-17T13:59:08.316Z\">2.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Leighton Andrews</strong>, the education minister in the Welsh government, told the World at One that Michael Gove's plan to replace GCSEs sounded like \"a backwards step for England\". <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-19620759#?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter\">There's a story about his comments on the BBC's website. </a>Here's the key quote.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It sounds to me as though it's a backwards step for England to be honest.

Asked if the government would delay universal credit, he said it was \u201con track\u201d to be implemented according to the current timetable. The government was \u201c100% committed\u201d to universal credit, he said.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Number 10 said the government\u2019s voluntary approach to getting more women on to company boards was working.</strong> Since March this year women have accounted for 44% of all appointments to FTSE 100 directorships, the spokesman said.

While until this moment the Tory guns have been silent, Tory operators have not been idle. They have been carefully researching Labour\u2019s weaknesses. Lessons have been learnt from the 1996 to 1997 period when the Conservative Party never settled on a consistent critique of Tony Blair. There\u2019ll be no return to the counter-productive demon eyes campaign. There will just be three endlessly repeated messages and they\u2019ll be delivered whenever possible by trusted surrogates.</p> <p>The ammunition has been loaded into the cannons, the carriage turned towards the enemy and the command to fire will soon be issued. Target one is Labour\u2019s borrowing plans. Using estimates from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, there\u2019ll be a campaign reminiscent of the famous tax bombshell posters from 1992. It will be directed at Labour\u2019s implicit plans to borrow \u00a3200 billion more. Target two will be Labour\u2019s opposition to the coalition\u2019s caps on benefits and immigration. Mr Osborne, in particular, sees these issues as possessing the potential to drive a wedge between Mr Miliband and Labour\u2019s heartland, blue-collar voters.</p> <p>Finally, there\u2019ll be a focus on the Labour leader himself. I\u2019m reassured that the negativity won\u2019t be personal but it will focus on Mr Miliband\u2019s opposition to all of the coalition\u2019s big deficit-reducing measures.

This is how he replied.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I would be advocating ramping up where we are. How you do that, whether it is along the lines of what the Turks have suggested, which is you create zones of immunity \u2013 these are questions that we should debate. What I\u2019m certainly very alarmed at the propsect of is the notion that we just leave that now. The consequences of that will be very brutal and very bloody for all the people there.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the anti-Islamic film that has generated protests throughout the Muslim world was \u201claughable\u201d.</strong> When it was pointed out that Salman Rushdie had described it as \u201ccrap\u201d, Blair said: \u201cHe\u2019s absolutely right. The film is, it may be wrong and offensive, but it\u2019s also laughable as a piece of film-making.\u201d</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the Arab world faced a battle between \u201cthe forces of modernisation\u201d and \u201cvery powerful forces of reaction\u201d.</strong> (In the UK he used to call them the \"forces of conservatism\".) It was important for the forces of modernisation to win, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the end we need both the leadership within those countries and within Islam to stand up and say, \u2018Look, there is a proper modern way of reconciling religious faith, democracy in society\u2019, and we need ourselves from the outside to engage with this process of change in a way that\u2019s constructive.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the emerging democracies in the Arab world had to learn that democracy was a value system, not just an electoral system.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We need to be saying to people who are starting with their democracy: \u2018democracy\u2019s not just a way of voting, it\u2019s a way of thinking; the test of a democracy is how you treat the minority as well as how the majority comes to power'.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-17T11:53:24.363Z\">at 12.53pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5056d1b358f9cf283191bd92\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-17T07:45:48.859Z\">8.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Michael Gove will be in the Commons at 3.30pm announcing details of his plans to replace GCSEs in England with a more rigorous exams.

  "<p>Five years ago, a young man by the name of Rob Delaney, 30 years old and living in California, was, by his own admission, having a bit of a tough time. He'd had tougher times for sure, having survived, in brutally quick succession, alcoholism, a near-fatal drink-driving accident and severe depression, but this was definitely another challenge. He'd recently walked away from a well-paid job where he had \"an office in a skyscraper\" to devote himself to standup. \"And I immediately went into abject poverty,\" he recalls. Like many before him, he discovered that comedy, as a career, is not always a&#xa0;load of laughs.</p> <p>Half a decade later, Delaney is one of&#xa0;the sensations of the US scene. He <a href=\"http://www.thecomedyawards.com/categories/viewers-choice/twitter/\" title=\"\">regularly tops audience polls</a>, and has an enormous, devoted following. When it was announced that he would do a week of shows in London next month, tickets sold out in an hour.</p> <p>How all this came to be can be summed up in one word, a very simple one and, in Delaney's eyes, a slightly embarrassing one: Twitter. Delaney is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/robdelaney\" title=\"\">huge on Twitter</a>, so much so that he can refer to himself, without a wince, as \"a content provider\". As I write, he has 600,000 followers, though it will doubtless be many more by the time you read this, and he has accrued them&#xa0;in just three years; he joined the site in 2009 when he realised it was \"a wonderful joke delivery mechanism\". His tweets, which range from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/robdelaney/status/237255446514241536\" title=\"\">the political</a> to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/robdelaney/status/242026938208755712\" title=\"\">the puerile</a>, have gained such traction that his comments about Mitt Romney, portraying the presidential candidate as a square, stupid bigot (\"Ha ha ha! Terrific! \u2013 Mitt Romney, every time Jar Jar Binks appears on screen\"; \"Healthcare should be decided by individual states, cuz y'know, Texas cancer is like, different from Colorado cancer? \u2013 Mitt Romney\") are more popular than Romney's own tweets, according to <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-08-02/mitt-romneys-twitter-nemesis\" title=\"\">Business Week</a>.</p> <p>So Twitter has been good to him, enabling him to live his dream. But when we meet in a London hotel, Delaney \u2013 a handsome bear of a man with a demeanour that oscillates between deadpan and thoughtful \u2013 is ambivalent about the blogging service. Not once does he check his smartphone; his eloquence and enthusiasm dims when I drop the T word.</p> <p>\"I feel silly about everything that's happened from it. I'm happy, of course, because I was doing standup for a while and pursuing all the traditional angles, and Twitter's just rocketed me to a whole new level.\" But he talks in the jaded tones of one who has wearied of the virtual world: \"You and I will be around a lot longer than Twitter, and nothing substitutes face to face. I use Twitter as a tool to get involved with people, to sell tickets to gigs where I can stand in a room and smell the audience \u2013 and I love that! I want to smell them. Not each of them individually because that would be against the law \u2026\"</p> <p>Like <a href=\"https://buy.louisck.net/\" title=\"\">Louis CK</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/chris-rock\" title=\"\">Chris Rock</a>, two of the greatest US standups alive today, Delaney's delivery is fast but brilliantly structured, profane but deeply moral, with none of the lazy misogyny or stereotyping too many comics use as a crutch. I went to see him earlier this year in Washington DC, green about what to expect, and could hardly speak afterwards, I was so winded from laughing.</p> <p>It's also very different from his Twitter feed, far more personal and less&#xa0;obviously political. \"With Twitter, you just want to make people laugh in their meeting; on stage, people have paid for their tickets with their hard-earned money so I owe them the truth as I experience it,\" he says. \"Plus, if I&#xa0;have&#xa0;to do the same show 100 times, I&#xa0;have to care very much about what I'm talking about.\"</p> <p>One of the many things he cares very much about is women's pubic hair. Specifically, the preservation of it. \"Oh yeah, definitely, but forgive me if I don't make eye contact with you while I talk about this because I do consider myself a gentleman,\" he says, which, coming from the man who frequently sends jokily salacious tweets to the pop star <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/adele\" title=\"\">Adele</a>, is as surprising as his self-distancing from Twitter. \"I mean, Jesus Christ, hair suggests sexual maturity, which I find attractive, as a lot of men do. But we have these big companies like Proctor &amp; Gamble, trying to sell products by making people feel bad about themselves, and they train their cannons more on women. And that, to me, is fundamentally wrong. It's a sin. I want people to feel good about themselves.\"</p> <p>Delaney was born in Boston and grew up wanting to be an actor. After graduating from college in New York, he moved to Los Angeles where he was somewhat sidetracked by alcoholism, a problem that came to an end when he was 25 and ploughed a car into the LA Department of Water and Power. \"When I came back into consciousness I asked the doctors and police if I had killed anyone, and I thought, if they say yes I'll wait until I get left alone and I'll kill myself, and if they say no, I am not drinking any more. They told me no, and I have not drunk or done any drugs since.\"</p> <p>He spent 24 hours in jail, and the judge gave him a choice between a prison sentence or rehab. He chose the&#xa0;latter. He also, at that point, decided to devote his life to comedy, \"because when I felt that I had a second chance I wanted to laugh and make people laugh.\" Then, a year later, he was walloped with depression. \"I think during that first year I was like, 'I can't believe I'm alive!' But then I let my defence mechanism down and went into a very bad depression in which I seriously considered suicide,\" he says, talking a little slower and lower. \"My depression was much more pummelling than the alcoholism because, with alcoholism, you can push away the feelings of horror by getting drunk. You don't get that with depression. Instead, it was a voice telling me, all day and all night, 'Kill yourself. Kill yourself.' \"</p> <p>Eventually, he went to a psychiatrist and was prescribed medication. The depression returned a few years ago when Delaney tried to cut down, and he has \"now achieved peace\" with the idea of being on tablets for the rest of his life. Being married and becoming a&#xa0;father, with one young child and another on the way, also helps, \"because it takes you out of that loop of selfishness in a wonderful way\".</p> <p>\"Depression taught me the importance of compassion and hard work, and that you can overcome enormous obstacles,\" he says simply. \"But also the importance of what's real. That's what matters.\" His iPhone, I notice, remains firmly in his pocket.</p>",
  "<p>Fears of a trade war between the United States and China intensified on Monday after Barack Obama launched action at the World Trade Organisation to stop Chinese auto industry aid from threatening jobs in the key electoral battleground state of Ohio.</p> <p>With growth and jobs seen as vital in the race for the White House, the administration said it had begun a case at the WTO in Geneva against what the White House said were illegal export subsidies for cars and car parts.</p> <p>The ratcheting up of the trade tension between the world's biggest and second biggest economies prompted immediate tit-for-tat retaliation from Beijing, which announced its own WTO case against the US.</p> <p>Trade experts said the tougher approach taken by Obama came as little surprise given the high level of unemployment. No president since Roosevelt in the 1930s has won an election with the jobless rate as high as 8.3% and the labour market has proved particularly weak in the so-called rust belt states of the midwest.</p> <p>\"Export subsidies are prohibited under WTO rules because they are unfair and severely distort international trade,\" US trade representative Ron Kirk said in a statement. \"China expressly agreed to eliminate all export subsidies when it joined the WTO in 2001.\" </p> <p>Obama's decision to adopt a more aggressive approach towards China followed accusations by Mitt Romney, his Republican challenger in the presidential race, that the president has been too soft in the face of repeated violations of global trade rules. </p> <p>China's export-led growth model has resulted in a trade surplus averaging $25bn a month in 2012, attracting criticism from manufacturing lobbying groups and unions.</p> <p>Jobs in the US auto parts sector dropped by roughly half between 2001 and 2010, while US imports of auto parts from China have increased seven-fold, according to the Obama administration.</p> <p>Ohio, one of the most important of the six swing states likely to decide this year's tight race for the White House, depends heavily on the auto industry, which was bailed out by Obama following the savage global downturn of 2008-09. Polls show that Obama has a slight edge in Ohio.</p> <p>Scott Paul, executive director of the American Alliance for Manufacturing welcomed the administration's move. </p> <p>\"The facts in the case are indisputable. China is subsidizing its auto parts sector, blocking our exports, and causing significant harm to workers and businesses in our nation,\" he said. \"Our auto assembly sector, now back on its feet, could be undercut by China's cheating, causing irreparable damage to the heart of America's productive economy.\" </p> <p>The WTO confirmed that the US had filed a case against China and that the two sides would now have a 60-day cooling-off period in which to seek an agreement. If the talks fail, a panel will be set up to decide whether US jobs had been outsourced as a result of subsidies that unfairly cut the cost of Chinese exports.</p> <p>Sources said that in high-profile cases involving the WTO's bigger members consultations often resulted in failure, and Beijing responded swiftly to the action taken by Obama by challenging measures adopted by the US to prevent the dumping of cheap Chinese goods, including kitchen utensils, steel, tyres, wood flooring, magnets and paper.</p> <p>China has already won one WTO case against the US over its use of anti-dumping measures, which forced Washington to bring in new laws designed to be compliant with global trade law. Beijing today said that the new US law was also in breach of WTO regulations and affected exports worth more than $7bn.</p> <p>\"Chinese enterprises in an uncertain legal environment, in violation of the relevant rules of the WTO transparency and due process,\" a spokesman for China's ministry of commerce said.</p> <p>Obama and Romney have both pushed China to the forefront as they seek to refocus their campaigns after a week dominated by foreign policy and the protests at US embassies across the Arab and Islamic world.</p> <p>Tough action on China is one of the few foreign policy positions Romney has pushed in the campaign so far, claiming Obama's weak response has harmed US workers. The president has countered with claims that Romney has investments in Chinese companies and outsourced jobs to China while running the private equity firm Bain Capital.</p>",
  "<p>In June 2012, the second Greek elections took place along \"pro\" versus \"anti\" bailout lines. Although the German government had pledged not to endorse anyone in the Greek race, on the day before the election, Angela Merkel said it was vital for Greece to elect lawmakers who would <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18474437\" title=\"\">respect austerity commitments</a>. Not surprisingly, in the event, the exhausted and bewildered Greek electorate gave the main opposition party the right to form a coalition.</p> <p>On the face of it, who could blame the Germans? Except, of course, never in recent history has so much interference been tolerated in the election of an independent sovereign country, and with so little comment outside that country about the unacceptability of such encroachment.</p> <p>Politicians in Europe seem to be either adopting the guise of technocrats, or being replaced by them. In Germany, technocratic solutions (and a particular form of economic orthodoxy) suits both the German psyche and their economy. Yet the removal of the prime minister in Greece \u2013 like the removal of both the prime minister and the cabinet in Italy \u2013 could be seen, in some respects, as a coup.</p> <p>Politics and professional technocracy have blended seamlessly. Faith in technocrats over politicians is not a trend from which Britain is exempt. Peter Keller, president of polling organisation YouGov, tested in spring the proposition that \"Britain would be governed better if our politicians got out of the way, and instead our ministers were non-political experts who knew how to run large organisations\". <a href=\"http://cdn.yougov.com/cumulus_uploads/document/ww4o7wko1q/WebVersion_Democracy%20in%20Britain%20A5.pdf\" title=\"\">Almost as many people agreed, 38%, as disagreed, 43%</a>.</p> <p>But it is at this moment we need politics and, dare I say it, politicians more than ever. Both to articulate the language of priorities, as described by Aneurin Bevan, but also to mediate and decide between contradictory demands from the public and short-term pressures alongside long-term imperatives. How much should we cut spending? Do we need to raise taxes? How do we structure our health and education systems? Making progress on these complex issues can be met only by elections, political engagement and democracy.</p> <p>Yet in order to defend politics and therefore political democracy, we need to change the way in which we \"do\" our politics. My pamphlet <a href=\"http://davidblunkett.typepad.com/\" title=\"\">In Defence of Politics Revisited</a>, published this week, sets out several concrete suggestions for how to achieve this.</p> <p>One unusual but not unthinkable idea, for instance, is for government to directly support mutual action and key campaigns. In the spring of 2012, consumer magazine Which? organised, under the heading The Big Switch, the coming together of almost 40,000 people in order to negotiate a better deal on domestic energy consumption. Government support for such initiatives would be transformational.</p> <p>Similarly, nurturing the process of getting people to run their own facilities locally can be seen as one of the few positive developments from the austerity agenda. There are good examples in North America of how services have been reshaped to offer this new way of meeting need. In Oregon, for example, people with mental health conditions are helped to live independent lives through a personal budget. They are assigned an adviser to identify goals and how to best use the budget to buy goods and services which will help them achieve these aims. \"Co-delivery\" would help people to help themselves.</p> <p>At the heart of pioneering a new approach to service delivery, we also need new finance mechanisms to help tackle the widening gap between rich and poor. This should include lifelong accounts developed jointly between the individual and government contributions.</p> <p>And at the centre of all this, we must refocus politics on core issues that matter most to people. Taking on the challenges of an ageing population and affordable retirement, and mobilising civil society through volunteering (including direct support to the million young people out of work and training) will require engagement, creative thinking and determination.</p> <p>We need to reaffirm that politics is not merely compatible with economic progress and development in the 21st century, but essential to it. In Europe, we cannot hope to move forward in a co-operative and productive way whilst one country seeks to dominate. But by confirming the importance of politics and politicians in Britain, we can build from the bottom up, and begin to reverse the worrying anti-politics trend, which will empower the elite technocrats and leave defenceless the man or woman in the street with a mere vote to cast.</p>",
  "<p>Critics like to talk about the \"films of the year\", but the awful truth is that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/16/us-police-question-film-maker-anti-islam-movie\" title=\"\">this year's most significant movie may well turn out to be a non-movie</a>, a hoax movie, a bigoted piece of poison calculated to inflame the Muslim world. Innocence of Muslims is a 13-minute low-budget video on YouTube, abysmally scripted, acted and directed; it might be risible were it not for the ugly Islamophobia which it promotes and whose effects are now being seen around the world.</p> <p>It was apparently made by an Egyptian-American based in the greater Los Angeles area, one Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, reportedly a Coptic Christian, who initially claimed to be an Israeli property magnate called Sam Bacile, using funds from \"Jewish donors\". How Nakoula actually bankrolled this film is not clear. He says his wife's family contributed the money; <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/15/police-hold-anti-islamic-film-maker\" title=\"\">he himself is a convicted fraudster</a>.</p> <p>This video is routinely described as a \"trailer\" and some screenings \u2013 of something \u2013 do appear to have taken place at one rented Californian cinema, but there is no proof that audiences ever saw anything substantially longer than this, nor that there is anything resembling a \"film\" of which this is a \"trailer\". Yet the damage is done. People throughout the Muslim world are being persuaded that there is a proper feature-length entertainment, backed by Jewish donors and being watched by Americans in their movie theatres.</p> <p>The video appears first to show Christians being attacked and a medical clinic trashed by a Muslim mob in Egypt while the police stand idly by. Here is where \u2013 for what it's worth \u2013 the bulk of Nakoula's budget appears to have been spent. Then we cut to a crass supposed retelling of the life of the prophet Muhammad. Hammy and preposterous acting is the order of the day, along with crude green-screen staging. People in robes exchange wooden dialogue and gurning threats against backprojected deserts. There is plenty of suspicious cutting and dubbing; crudely Islamophobic lines don't lip-synch with what the actors are mouthing \u2013 stuff like: \"Muhammad is our messenger and the Koran is our constitution!\" It is quite possible that the actors had no idea what they were doing.</p> <p>But the really sinister thing is that all this ham-fistedness and crassness is an important sense deliberate. It has to look like propaganda for the provocation to be effective.</p> <p>Innocence of Muslims might prove, in the most nauseatingly ironic way, that cinema still can make a difference. Actually, what it proves is that the movies are still associated with an idea \u2013 the idea of America's global power and prestige. If you can produce something hinting at a film proving that this power is being put to Islamophobic uses, you can get an extreme reaction. Heaven knows there are plenty of gung-ho Hollywood movies with Arab villains \u2013 respectably produced and distributed \u2013 all feeding the disenchantment.</p> <p>Also, of course, it proves the global reach of the internet. Explosive material can be easily disseminated. Perhaps the most comparable example is <a href=\"http://www.kony2012.com/\" title=\"\">Kony2012</a>, the powerful viral video calling for the arrest of Ugandan cult leader Joseph Kony which in March this year exploded uncontrollably in popularity and resulted in its director suffering a temporary emotional breakdown. Innocence of Muslims, a thoroughly nasty piece of work, has caused something worse than this, and was intended to. But like Kony2012, it was almost certainly timed for the American election, in this case to incite Muslim communities and then provoke macho responses from the presidential candidates.</p> <p>There is naturally a great deal of ultra-dodgy stuff out there on the web, with no gatekeepers to enforce levels of technical competence or ideological good taste. All sorts of murky videos can be accessed. Throughout both east and west, a whole generation is disenchanted with conventional media and looks to the web, with its plethora of user-generated content, for explanations. There are weird conspiracy-theorist movies on the web by \"truthers\", promoting the idea that the American government faked 9/11 as a pretext to wage war for Middle Eastern oil. Well, crackpot as these theories undoubtedly are, our British and American governments brought them on themselves with their mendacious claims about WMD.</p> <p>This is what has brought Innocence of Muslims into being. Even discussing it in these terms plays into its authors' hands. Here's hoping Muslim communities can be persuaded to treat it with the contempt it deserves and that the US president and his challenger can keep their nerve.</p>",
  "<p>\"You want to run for president?\" asked the New York Times columnist Frank Bruni in his book Ambling into History. \"Here's what you need to do.</p> <p>\"Have someone write you a lovely speech that stakes out popular positions in unwavering language \u2013 and less popular positions in fuzzier terms. Better yet, if it bows to God and country at every turn: that's called uplift. Make it rife with optimism, a trumpet blast not just about morning in America but about a perpetual dazzling dawn. Avoid talk of hard choices and daunting challenges; nobody wants those. Nod to people on all points of the political spectrum \u2026 Add a soupcon of alliteration. Sprinkle with a few personal observations or stories: it humanises you. Stir with enthusiasm.\"</p> <p>So it was at the beginning of the year, as the Republicans competed to see who could paint the gloomiest picture of Barack Obama's America, that Obama reached back for the signature theme of his 2008 campaign: hope. Seeking to channel Ronald Reagan's re-election theme of 1984, when the nation was emerging from economic crisis, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/us/politics/president-offers-theme-of-nation-seeing-comeback.html\">he used his state of the union speech in January to claim: \"America is back\"</a>. \"Anyone who tells you that America is in decline, or that our influence has waned, doesn't know what they're talking about,\" he said.</p> <p>He test-drove the phrase in a range of settings. \"I placed my bet on the American worker,\" <a href=\"http://www.freep.com/article/20120228/NEWS15/120228026/President-Barack-Obama-UAW-speech\">he told a union conference in DC a month later</a>. \"The American auto industry is back.\" A month after that, at a fundraiser in Houston, he told donors: \"The recovery is accelerating. America is coming back.\"</p> <p>This was by no means an absurd claim. By February there had been three straight months of employment growth; the final quarter of 2011 showed a spike in consumer borrowing, signalling more consumption and more lending. In the spring, many felt they witnessed the green shoots of economic recovery. And electorally it seemed like a smart claim, too. American voters may want politicians to ponder their fragility, but they've never been particularly keen on them actually reflecting it. The country was emerging from two failed wars and the most severe recession since the Great Depression. Confidence in America's political and financial classes was shattered; assumptions about its military supremacy were dented. <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/151979/national-satisfaction-slightly-start-2012.aspx\">According to Gallup</a>, the last time most Americans were satisfied with the&#xa0;direction the country was heading in was January 2004 \u2013 and that stint of optimism lasted less than a week. The Republicans were wedded to the notion that under Obama America was in decline. Rick Santorum claimed it was an election \"to save the soul of America\" \u2013 prompting the question: well, then, who had lost it? \u2013 while Mitt Romney insisted he'd return the nation to a day when \"each of us could walk a little taller and stand a little straighter\". Obama's message was: \"Walk tall. We're on our way.\"</p> <p>There was only one problem. People did not believe it. In February, <a href=\"http://www.greenbergresearch.com/\">Greenberg, Quinlan, Rosner Research</a> focus-grouped four different ways of framing the nation's economic trajectory. Two concentrated on the enduring struggles of American middle-class families, and two claimed recovery was under way. The two that did best argued: \"This is a make-or-break time for the middle class, and for all those trying to get into it.\" The one that tested worst, by a considerable margin, claimed: \"America is back\".</p> <p>\"America is not back,\" Stanley Greenberg, GQR's chief executive, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/us/politics/president-offers-theme-of-nation-seeing-comeback.html\">told the New York Times</a>. \"We have long-term fundamental problems. If you look at our data and history, it takes a long time before job numbers translate into accepting at a personal level that things are better.\"</p> <p>Indeed, if anything, Americans felt they were going backwards. Most believe young people will have a worse life than their parents, and a third think the country's best days are behind it. It's not difficult to see why. For 90% of Americans, wages have been effectively stagnant for the last 40 years, while median house prices have slumped 20% since 2006. Over the past decade, the cost of tuition has risen 32%, and the average healthcare premiums have rocketed 113%.<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/fed-americans-wealth-dropped-40-percent/2012/06/11/gJQAlIsCVV_story.html\"> A report earlier this year</a> revealed that between 2007 and 2010, the median American family lost a generation of wealth. With figures like that, insisting that America is back sounds more like happy talk than fighting talk.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396639801\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/9/17/1347891311374/Barack-Obama-makes-a-camp-010.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama makes a campaign stop in Las Vegas\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama: standing not on his promise, but on his record. Photograph: Getty</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Isaac Brekken/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p></p> <p>Herein lies the central dilemma for Obama's re-election. In 2008 he ran, with considerable rhetorical force, on a promise of hope and change in the midst of an economic crisis \u2013 and on his ability to bring consensus to a divided political class. But, for many, things have changed for the worse, and the country is even more polarised than when he started.</p> <p>So the substantial benefits of his presidency are not fully apparent \u2013 particularly to those most likely to have voted for him. Meanwhile, the symbolic significance of his candidacy is largely spent. You can only be elected the first black president once. His presence remains a source of great pride to many, particularly African Americans and the young. People will still travel halfway across the country on their own dime to hear him speak, and hawkers still sell T-shirts at his events. When he went to Fort Myers in Florida to speak in July, people started lining up for tickets the night before.</p> <p>But this time he's not standing on his promise, but on his record. Shortly after his inauguration, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/02/us/politics/economy-cuts-into-obamas-youth-support.html\">he told NBC</a>: \"Look, I'm at the start of my administration. One nice thing about the situation I find myself in is that I will be held accountable. You know, I've got four years. And a year from now I think people are going to see that we're starting to make some progress.</p> <p>\"But there's still going to be some pain out there. If I don't have this done in three years, there's going to be a one-term proposition.\"</p> <p>The pain is still out there, and that is precisely the proposition the Republicans are now making.</p> <p>***</p> <p>There are several ways Obama can counter this. When he first ran, few understood the depth of the economic crisis, and few could have predicted the implosion of the eurozone and the subsequent drag on the world economy. <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/14/us-usa-campaign-economy-bush-idUSBRE85D0XI20120614\">Roughly two-thirds of the country</a> still blame Bush for the state of the economy, while only half hold Obama responsible. Republicans have been both obdurate and obtuse in Congress, where approval ratings have rarely scraped 20%. The trouble is, to a sceptical ear, these sound more like justifications for why he has failed to deliver than explanations as to how he might succeed if given more time.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/dnc-2012-bill-clintons-speech-at-the-democratic-national-convention-excerpt/2012/09/05/f208865e-f7a4-11e1-8253-3f495ae70650_print.html\">Bill Clinton conceded as much</a> during his convention speech in Charlotte. \"Here's the challenge he faces,\" he said. \"A lot of Americans are still angry and frustrated about this economy. If you look at the numbers, you know employment is growing, banks are beginning to lend again, and in a lot of places, housing prices have even began to pick up.</p> <p>\"But too many people do not feel it yet. I had this same thing happen in 1994 and early '95. But the difference this time is purely in the circumstances. President Obama started with a much weaker economy than I did. Listen to me now: no president could have fully repaired all the damage that he found in just four years. If you will renew the president's contract, you will feel it. You will feel it. Folks, whether the American people believe what I just said or not may be the whole election. I just want you to know that I believe it. With all my heart, I believe it.\"</p> <p>The trouble for Obama is that not enough Americans do believe it. Stewardship of the economy is the one area where Romney has been generally outpolling him (although it has been slipping since the conventions). It is also by far the most important issue in the election. In the nine states Obama won from Republicans last time, <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/156389/Thirteen-States-Give-Obama-Majority-Approval.aspx\">his approval ratings are below 50</a>; in six they are 45 or less. <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/web/laus/laumstrk.htm\">Unemployment is higher in six of them</a> today than it was <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/laus_03112009.htm\">when he was inaugurated</a>. In the midterms, Republicans took more than 20% of the House seats from Democrats in those states. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/mar/11/obama-republican-rivals-mitt-romney\">His defeat is not just plausible; it's possible</a>. Indeed, given the metrics of unemployment, approval ratings, real disposable personal income growth per capita (what the average person has left after tax and inflation) <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/jan/10/obamas-reelection-prospects-hard-numbers\">he should lose</a>. </p> <p>And if that weren't enough, Republicans will have far more money. In 2008, Obama outspent McCain by more than two to one. He has also outspent Romney so far, although that is largely because Romney had to wait until he was formally nominated before dipping into reserves of cash. But thanks to changes in the fundraising laws that allow unlimited donations from anonymous sources, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/06/democrats-money-panic-is-obama-about-to-get-swamped-by-gop-cash/259018/\">Democrats fear being massively outspent by Republicans and their supporters this time</a>. Obama donors at the convention were asked to open their wallets with the message: \"If they outspend us by two or three times we're OK. But if it goes much beyond that we're in trouble.\" After a successful convention they came back <a href=\"http://thehill.com/conventions-2012/dem-convention-charlotte/247263-hill-poll-voters-think-second-term-undeserved\">thrilled by the speeches and daunted by the prospects</a>.</p> <p>\"If the economy is doing great then any leader looks great,\" says one of Washington's premier electoral analysts, Charlie Cook. \"And if the economy is doing lousy I think almost any leader looks bad.\" The day the Democratic convention opened, <a href=\"http://thehill.com/conventions-2012/dem-convention-charlotte/247263-hill-poll-voters-think-second-term-undeserved\">a poll showed</a> that most Americans believe the country is worse off than it was when Obama was nominated four years ago, and that he does not deserve a second term. The day after it ended, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/08/us/politics/a-day-later-its-still-the-economy.html\">the Treasury released a weak jobs report</a> signalling a feeble recovery that's close to stalling. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396639802\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/5/5/1304593224257/Barack-Obama-Joe-Biden-Hi-008.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton and others receive an update on the mission Osama bin Laden\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Situation Room in the White House. Obama has portrayed the killing of Osama bin Laden as a foreign policy success. Photograph: Pete Souza/AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pete Souza/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p></p> <p>The problem is not that he doesn't have a record. He can point to significant achievements that would or should satisfy his base and arguably credit him with the most progressive term since Lyndon Johnson. He has appointed two women \u2013 including the first Hispanic \u2013 to the supreme court, implemented a version of healthcare reform, ended don't ask, don't tell, withdrawn combat troops from Iraq and presented a timetable for withdrawing forces from Afghanistan. He authorised the killing of Osama bin Laden, and the US's standing in the world has greatly improved since he took over among both allies and enemies alike. </p> <p>The problem is that the record Obama has does not include the single most important achievement he could hope for \u2013 improving the economic lot of the broad swathe of middle America. And the various things it does include do not add up to a narrative. (It doesn't help that the main advantages to his principle achievement \u2013 healthcare \u2013 do not kick in for another two years). This was evident at the convention, where the same laundry list of Obama's achievements (the Lilly Ledbetter Act, which protects equal pay for equal work for women; the repeal of don't ask, don't tell; Bin Laden's killing; healthcare; his executive order on young immigrants) were aired each night less as a theme than an incantation.</p> <p>It is a flaw best illustrated in <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/01/bidens-shorthand-for-obama-1st-term-osama-bin-laden-dead-general-motors-alive/\">Joe Biden's claim to donors</a> in Fort Worth, Texas, that: \"The best way to sum up the job the president has done if you need a real shorthand: Osama bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive.\" Among other problems, such a summary links a single military operation and a particular economic achievement, both of which mark progress that is both episodic and partial. A counter-summary could just as easily read: \"Al-Qaida is alive and the economy is dying.\" Moreover, it falls well short of \"We're back,\" (which is what people want to hear), let alone \"hope\" and \"change\" (which is what they heard last time).</p> <p>The greatest case for Obama's presidency so far can be summed up thus: things were terrible when I came to power, are much better than they would have been were I not in power, and will deteriorate if I am removed from power. Even if one accepts these claims as true, and understands them as important, they're a long way from the uplifting message of four years ago. Not so much \"Yes we can,\" as \"Could be worse\".</p> <p>The problem with Obama trying to echo Reagan's lines of 1984 is that Republicans can and do counter with Reagan's line from 1980, when, concluding a debate with Jimmy Carter, he asked: \"Are you better off than you were four years ago? Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the store than it was four years ago? Is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was four years ago?\"</p> <p>At the Republican convention in Tampa, this was evoked as the game-changing line gifted to Romney by history. But it only works if Reagan's quote is hacked in half. For the Gipper immediately went on to ask: \"Is America as respected throughout the world as it was? Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we're as strong as we were four years ago?\" Even with American embassies under siege, most here would give him credit for that.</p> <p>It is rare for a president to recover from this level of protracted economic distress, particularly when they brought such high hopes with them. But the last year handed Obama two crucial, mutually reinforcing tools with which he could start to build an electoral revival. The first was Occupy Wall Street, which sprouted offshoots in every state in the country, burning brightly before fading into smaller more grassroots campaigns. The occupations had no specific demands, and had no organic connection to the Democratic party. But by concentrating their ire on the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jul/15/democrats-romney-firing-obama\">inequities of the financial system and the greed of financial elites</a> \u2013 two things Obama had failed to do anything about \u2013 they shifted the target of national frustration from government to inequality.</p> <p>Polls showed a significant portion of the country agreed with its aims, with 77% believing there is too much power in the hands of a few rich people and corporations. Even as rightwing pundits and politicians mocked the protests (\"Get a job right after you take a bath,\" said Republican contender Newt Gingrich), conservative analysts noted that they had struck a chord. When rightwing pollster Frank Luntz addressed the Republican Governors Association in December, he told them: \"The public still prefers capitalism to socialism, but they think capitalism is immoral. And if we're seen as defenders of Wall Street, we've got a problem.\"</p> <p>Obama had clearly got the message. In the same state of the union speech in which he proclaimed the US to be back, he appealed directly to the 98% of the country that earns less than $250,000. \"Let's never forget,\" he said: \"Millions of Americans who work hard and play by the rules every day deserve a government and a financial system that does the same. It's time to apply the same rules from top to bottom: no bailouts, no handouts, and no cop-outs.\"</p> <p>And while there is no narrative in which to couch his first term, there is a theme for his second: fairness. Like a mantra at Charlotte, speakers argued for the middle class to have a \"fair shot\" and the rich to give their \"fair share\" as they carefully made it clear that inequality of outcome and income were tolerable so long as equality of opportunity was available. <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/transcript-elizabeth-warrens-democratic-convention-speech/story?id=17164726\">Massachusetts Senate candidate Elizabeth Warren</a> received a huge cheer when she said: \"People feel like the system is rigged against them. And here's the painful part: they're right. The system is rigged. Look around. Oil companies guzzle down billions in subsidies. Billionaires pay lower tax rates than their secretaries. Wall Street CEOs \u2013 the same ones who wrecked our economy and destroyed millions of jobs \u2013 still strut around Congress, no shame, demanding favours, and acting like we should thank them.\"</p> <p>The second gift has been Romney: a wooden candidate <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/28/mitt-romney_n_1239103.html\">whose personal wealth amounts to double the combined wealth of the last eight presidents</a> going back to Richard Nixon and yet only pays 14% tax. For if Occupy Wall Street reframed the debate, then <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jul/18/mitt-romney-turning-into-john-kerry-2012-election\">it also provided the basis to depict Romney</a> as out-of-touch magnate with a tin ear for the travails of the common man. Most of the Democratic attacks over the summer, over the firings and outsourcings at Bain Capital \u2013 the firm that Romney once ran \u2013 and over demands for his tax records, or about his wealthy donors, fit that mould. This rich guy doesn't understand you or what you're going through, and now he wants to buy the election.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396639803\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/9/17/1347892988474/Barack-Obama-and-Michelle-010.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama and Michelle at the Democratic national convention in Charlotte\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">'Barack knows the American dream because he's lived it.'

That tack <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/romneys-favorability-ratings-stall/2012/08/07/b9b8c612-e0fa-11e1-a421-8bf0f0e5aa11_blog.html\">seems to be paying off</a>. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/01/us/politics/polls-give-obama-edge-in-pennsylvania-ohio-and-florida.html\">Polls show that in swing states</a>, where people are more likely to have seen the ads, they are twice as likely to see Romney's time at Bain as a reason to vote against him. Elsewhere the nation is evenly split.</p> <p>In the crucial swing states of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida, where voters were asked the question: \"Would you say that Mitt Romney cares about the needs and problems of people like you, or not?\", most said \"not\". The poll showed that 54% of likely voters in Pennsylvania, 55% in Ohio, and 49% in Florida felt that Romney did not care about their problems. The Republican convention was dedicated in no small part turning that perception around. Arguably, it didn't work.</p> <p>So while Obama is vulnerable, he is nonetheless ahead. In national polls his lead is narrow \u2013 within the margin of error \u2013 but has widened since the convention. In the swing states he is performing better. Last time around he took nine states that Republicans had won in 2004; New Mexico, Nevada, Colorado, Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, Virginia, North Carolina and Florida. But <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/president/\">according to Real Clear Politics' average of polls</a>, he leads in seven of them and trails in just two (Indiana and North Carolina). The New York Times' Nate Silver, a well-respected statistician, psephologist and <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/author/nate-silver/\">author of the Five Thirty Eight blog</a>, currently gives Obama a 75% chance of winning. And 59% of voters now believe Obama will win \u2013 although this is far more than will actually vote for him.</p> <p>So the president has plenty of wriggle room as he seeks a path to victory this time around. He could lose the marquee states of Ohio and Florida, as well as the smaller states of New Hampshire, Iowa and Indiana, and still get his second term.</p> <p>But it may not even come to that. Republicans were supposed to have picked much of the low hanging fruit clean by summer's end. But only in Indiana is Romney truly secure, while in North Carolina he is only now pulling away. Of the states Democrats won in 2004, only in Wisconsin is Obama really vulnerable. In some previously closely contested states, such as New Mexico and Pennsylvania, Romney is barely in contention. In the rest, Obama's lead is narrow (within the margin of error) but consistent and growing. <a href=\"http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/09/13/13848313-polls-obama-holds-the-edge-in-florida-ohio-and-virginia?lite\">A poll late last week</a> showed Romney trailing Obama by at least five points in Florida, Virginia and Ohio. Although Romney wouldn't have to shift the needle very far to win, he'd have to shift a lot of needles in the same direction to stand a chance. Obama has precious little reason to be complacent, but every reason to be optimistic at this stage. His response to events like the riots across the Muslim world could still shift the trajectory, as could Republicans' cash advantage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396639804\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/9/17/1347891507685/Obama-supporters-in-New-H-010.jpg\" alt=\"Obama supporters in New Hampshire\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Obama supporters in New Hampshire.

This will be no simple task. Obama has considerable work to do on this front. Unlike four years ago, <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2012/06/21/gop-holds-early-turnout-edge-but-little-enthusiasm-for-romney/\">Republican voters are more likely to say it really matters who wins this election</a>, to say they have given quite a lot of thought to the election and to have paid close attention to news about the election. Their base \u2013 white, wealthy, older people \u2013 is also more likely to turn out. The good news for the Democrats is that voters are more enthusiastic about their candidate. The percentage of people who said they strongly supported Obama was both higher than any Democratic candidate since 1988, including himself in 2008, and almost double those who strongly support Mitt Romney. The only candidate who's ever scored higher was George Bush in 2004.</p> <p>Democrat supporters also appear more engaged. <a href=\"http://pewresearch.org/pubs/2326/obama-outpaces-romney-on-social-media-election-2012-facebook-twitter-youtube\">A survey of web and social media usage by Pew</a> found that the Obama campaign posted nearly four times as much content as the Romney campaign on the web, was active on nearly twice as many platforms and prompted twice the number of shares, views and comments.</p> <p>In 2008, Obama's victory was due, in no small part, to his ability to expand the electorate by attracting constituencies that had previously been under-represented at the polls \u2013 particularly young, black and Latino voters. He did not just win them by huge margins, but <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/voting/cb09-110.html\"> managed to amplify their electoral clout</a> by motivating them to turn out in huge numbers.</p> <p>But those are the very groups who have suffered most under his presidency. Unemployment for 18- to 19-year-olds is 23.5%; for those 20 to 24 it's lower at 12.9%, but still significantly higher than the national rate of 8.2%. Black unemployment is at 14.1% \u2013 a 10% increase on when he was inaugurated. While Hispanic unemployment has remained steady, Obama has deported more undocumented immigrants than any president since the 1950s.</p> <p>Polls show Obama still holds a significant advantage among all three groups, attracting 89% of the black vote and 60% of both the Latino vote and the 18-to-29 age group. The issue is less whether those people will vote for him <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/daily/obama-s-enthusiasm-deficit-could-soon-haunt-him-20120902\">but how many will show up</a>, since all three groups are less reliable voters. \"We haven't seen much of the stimulus trickle down to our people here,\" Mark Allen, a Chicago-based community organiser who used to work alongside Obama, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/for-obama-acquaintance-change-was-not-enough/2012/08/16/92deaf86-e7d8-11e1-a3d2-2a05679928ef_gallery.html\">told the Washington Post</a>. \"I liked the community organizer Obama better than President Obama \u2026 Democrats say Barack has got 90% or whatever of the black vote wrapped up. What they don't tell you is it's 90% of those who actually come out and vote. What if it's 90% of just 30 or 40% who vote?\"</p> <p>In fact, the black turnout is the one part of his base that remains solid, but Democrats are <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/02/us/politics/economy-cuts-into-obamas-youth-support.html\">less certain of Latinos and the young</a>. In a base election, enthusiasm is key. Since black, Latino and young people live everywhere, there is not a single swing state where this is not an issue, and arguably only New Hampshire and Iowa \u2013 two of the whitest states in the country \u2013 where it is not key. This in no small part explains his decision to use the power of his office in June to halt the deportation of thousands of young undocumented immigrants \u2013 something he could have done at any time during his presidency. In an executive order he ruled that young immigrants who arrived in the US illegally before age 16 and spent at least five continuous years here would be allowed to stay and apply for work permits, providing they had no criminal history and met other criteria, such as graduating from high school or serving honorably in the military.</p> <p>This time around, he is also seeking to make inroads among white women, many of whom are turned off by Republican views on abortion and contraception, pensioners, who may be nervous about Republican plans for Medicare (both of which he lost by 53-45 in 2008), and gay voters, buoyed by his support for gay marriage and motivated by Republican opposition to it. If there is any volatility in this race, it is not about the breadth of his support but the depth of it. <a href=\"http://2012.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/09/barack-obama-likely-voters-enthusiasm-african-americans-latinos-lgbt-young-voters-turnout.php\">National polls of registered voters</a> may mostly show him with a narrow lead; but polls of likely voters often show him trailing.</p> <p>The one thing that hasn't changed since 2008 is the Democrats' emphasis on the \"ground game\" \u2013 sending volunteers out to collect information, persuade and, ultimately, ferry people to the polls. <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2012/08/29/obamas-ground-game-advantage/?print=1\">One Washington Post survey</a> showed 20% of registered voters had been contacted by the Obama campaign, compared to 13% who'd been contacted by Mitt Romney's campaign. And Democrats had been particularly effective at reaching their base. Forty-two percent of liberal Democrats said they'd been contacted, as well as 24% non-whites and 31% of the people who voted for Obama last time. </p> <p>\"This is light years ahead of where we were in 2008,\" <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/04/jim-messina-democratic-convention_n_1854481.html\">said Obama's campaign manager, Jim Messina, during a forum in Charlotte</a>. \"We are going to make 2008, on the ground, look like Jurassic Park.\" They plan to knock on more than twice as many doors and register twice as many voters as they did last time. In North Carolina they have twice as many field offices as the Romney campaign. In Ohio they have three times as many.</p> <p>If Obama were only running against Romney, his victory would be all but assured by this stage. But he isn't. He's running against the economy, and on his promise to be a transformative president in tough times. To the extent that a second-term election is a referendum on the incumbent, Obama is losing. Too many voters think he's not done enough. To the degree, however, to which any election is a choice between at least two candidates, he is winning. Enough voters feel he is better than his opponent. For now, at least, he is not so much the change they can believe in as the change agent they most believe in. And while the semantic difference is minimal, the rhetorical difference could hardly be greater.</p>",
