  "<p>Six members of the Olympic and Paralympic teams from the Democratic Republic of Congo are planning to claim political asylum on Monday after the conclusion of the 2012 games.</p> <p>The athletes and coaches, who are appealing to the UK government for sanctuary, say murders of opponents by government forces and other human rights abuses are on the increase. They claim the situation has deteriorated sharply since the elections last November in which President Joseph Kabila was re-elected despite claims that his main rival Etienne Tshisekedi was the true winner. Widespread violence was reported during the election period.</p> <p>Those claiming asylum are Paralympic athletes Levy Kitambala Kinzito and Dedeline Mibamba Kimbata, the national technical director of the Athletic Federation of Congo, Guy Nkita Kinkela, who is here as a coach, boxing coach Adelare Ibula Masengo and Judo coach Blaise Bekwa. Judoka Cedric Mandembo has gone into hiding and is also thought to be fearing persecution from the Congolese government.</p> <p>Wearing T-shirts supporting the recently launched \"Stop Kabila Now\" campaign by Congolese dissidents, and the 2012 games passes that confirm they are representing their country, some of the athletes were close to tears as they talked about events in their homeland.</p> <p>They said there is a political split in the Congolese team at the 2012 games, with some supporting Kabila and others strongly opposed to him.</p> <p>Kinkela said: \"Some athletes here are supporters of Kabila but we don't know them. Some replaced athletes with a better track record. One athlete shares the surname of the opposition leader, Tshisekedi, and he was not allowed to come because his surname was considered to be promoting the opposition leader.</p> <p>\"We feel that the members of the team who support Kabila are watching our movements.\"</p> <p>The asylum-seekers have criticised the Congolese government on the African TV channel Ben TV since arriving in London. They claim this has meant that they are regarded as traitors.</p> <p>Bekwa said: \"My brother was a supporter of the opposition. He was shot and killed on election day. The situation is so bad in Congo and there is a real need for us to receive protection in the UK. If you oppose the government, it is not only the individual who is at risk but their family and friends too.\"</p> <p>Kinkela added: \"In Congo, I have attended demonstrations against the government but it is hard to publicly criticise Kabila when I am in my country. In London, we are free to speak.\"</p> <p>Kimbata said she had seen some of her neighbours shot dead by government forces on election day. \"In my area, 95% of people voted against Kabila.\"</p> <p>She lost both legs after stepping on a landmine and said that she had not benefited from money given to Congolese athletes by games officials. \"I'm a wheelchair racer but I don't have a racing chair in Congo, only an orthopaedic chair that is supposed to be pushed by someone else. I was told to keep quiet about this and not complain about the lack of equipment I had during my training.\"</p> <p>She is racing at the games in a chair donated to her by British Paralympic athlete Anne Wafula Strike. Strike, who was born in Kenya, has highlighted the problems of disabled athletes from developing countries in accessing the right equipment to compete.</p> <p>Human rights abuses in Congo are widely documented. A delegation of UK Border Agency officials are in Congo now to investigate claims of persecution of refused asylum-seekers from the UK.</p> <p>Okito Tongomo, chair of the Congolese Support Group in the UK \u2013 which opposes the Kabila government \u2013 said: \"This is a tragic situation and these members of the Congolese team need protection here in the UK. There is a long history of human rights abuses in Congo but things are getting worse.\"</p> <p>The team's solicitor, Hani Zubeidi, said: \"They are planning to claim asylum on Monday. I hope the Home Office gives them an appointment without delay. Sometimes, people have to wait for weeks before they can lodge their asylum claim but these claims should be dealt with urgently.\"</p>",
  "<p>Over the past two weeks, both major American political parties held their nominating conventions \u2013 and that's pretty much where the similarities end. After interminable speeches, cloying videos and occasional moments of rhetorical eloquence, the philosophical and tonal divide between them has never felt broader. Quite simply, Democrats and Republicans operate in two completely distinct realms, one that is defined by an attachment to reality and one that is increasingly detached from it.</p> <p>If their three-day convention in Tampa is any indication, Republicans reside in a fantasy world where government plays no role but that of malevolence, where the free market is the salvation to all that ails this nation and where the country is locked in a Manichaean struggle between the forces of freedom and a failed, socialist interloper named Barack Obama.</p> <p>It was a point driven home to me in Tampa when I overheard a Republican delegate declare in a sweet voice, reflecting more pity than anger: \"There's a communist living in the White House.\"</p> <p>For four decades, Republicans have relied on an undercurrent of white resentment toward social and economic change to maintain their pre-eminence in national politics. But with an African-American president and the country moving closer to \"minority-majority\" status, that dominance is slipping away and it feeds the sense of anger and desperation they tried to keep hidden in Tampa, but that all too often crept to the surface. Indeed, the entire Republican \"you didn't build that\" attack against Obama (a line taken brazenly and dishonestly out of context) is reminiscent of decades of Republican talking points that sought to cast their party as the defender of hard-working Americans and the Democrats as the defender of dependency, particularly for poor minorities.</p> <p>There was in Tampa a genuine sense of frustration about the direction in which the country is heading, which led to an often harsh message, perhaps best exemplified by New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who declared: \"Our leaders of today have decided it's more important to be popular, to say and do what's easy and say yes rather than to say no, when no is what is required.\" The dominant political attribute of the last four years is the increasing ideological inflexibility and lack of social empathy from the Republican party, and the convention only confirmed it. On the flipside, the Democrats in Charlotte were practically unrecognisable in their self-confidence and the discipline of their political message. Michelle Obama's well-crafted speech sought to cast Democrats as the true defenders of the middle class, while Bill Clinton's rambling brilliance on Wednesday offered a sweeping defence of Obama's record and an indictment of Republican intransigence.</p> <p>Moreover, a party once derided for playing interest-group politics showed no hesitancy about going down that road in Charlotte. The convention was full of obvious appeals to women, gays, blacks, Hispanics, young people and, in the constant references to the successful bailout of the US car industry, organised labour. These are the groups that form the backbone of the Democratic coalition and are essential to the party's long-term success. Democrats far better than Republicans appreciate the destiny of demographics and they have done a far more effective job of cultivating these voters. Indeed, the contrast between the hues in Charlotte and Tampa was remarkable. The Democratic party is a party that looks like the palette of the American experience, not just in skin colour, but in class level. The Republican party (the one in the Tampa convention hall) is one that looks like Sunday brunch at a country club.</p> <p>Even on national security, an issue on which Democrats have long suffered in comparison with Republicans, the party that killed Osama bin Laden and brought US troops home from Iraq didn't just flex its military muscles, it openly derided Republicans. When Obama joked: \"My opponent and his running mate are new to foreign policy,\" it felt like a transformational moment in the politics of national security.</p> <p>On economic issues, Democrats have a tougher hand to play as the blame for the country's mediocre recovery is pretty much the only thing standing between Obama and re-election. Nonetheless, Democrats sounded the note of economic populism, as they attacked Mitt Romney for his wealth and support for tax cuts for the richest Americans. There was a time when Democrats recoiled from such obvious appeals to class warfare; now they seem to revel in them, secure in the knowledge they face off against an opponent and a political party (because of its unstinting opposition to upper-income tax increases) that can be so easily confronted on this issue.</p> <p>In her populist speech in Charlotte, Massachusetts Senate candidate Elizabeth Warren declared: \"Our middle class has been chipped, squeezed and hammered\u2026 people feel like the system is rigged against them. And here's the painful part: they're right.\" According to Warren: \"The Republican vision is clear: 'I've got mine, the rest of you are on your own'.\" Warren wasn't blowing smoke. Consider the words of Republican vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan: \"I never thought of myself as stuck in some station in life. I was on my own path, my own journey, an American journey, where I could think for myself, decide for myself\u2026 that is what we do in this country. That is the American dream. That's freedom and I will take it any day over the supervision and sanctimony of the central planners.\"</p> <p>Compare this with how President Obama defined freedom in his speech: \"We, the people, recognise that we have responsibilities as well as rights; that our destinies are bound together; that a freedom which asks only what's in it for me, a freedom without a commitment to others, a freedom without love or charity or duty or patriotism, is unworthy of our founding ideals and those who died in their defence.\"</p> <p>The choices offered by Ryan and Obama are essential issues in this campaign. One party wants to use the powers of government to ameliorate social inequalities; the other seeks to reduce it into oblivion. The irony is that Americans are generally predisposed to take Ryan's side of this argument, but the uncompromising manner in which the Republicans speak of economic freedom has left them vulnerable to the Democrats' more inclusive, hopeful and optimistic message.</p> <p>With a decided advantage in the electoral college and a stubborn but narrow lead in the polls, Obama has the political wind at his back. The conventions, while preaching mainly to the converted, have likely given him a near-term boost. While hardly impossible, it's difficult to see what Romney can do to shift the trajectory of the race. But even more difficult is seeing how Republicans, if they lose, can find a long-term message that competes with the Democrats' vision. If the national conventions showed us anything, it is that the winds of political fortune are not blowing in a Republican direction.</p>",

  "<p>For anyone horrified or mystified by aspects of the Republican Tea Party in Tampa, the Democrat convention would have been a relief. It was to us. Democrats are hungry to win \u2013 and to choose a different path.</p> <p>Labour's route to government requires us to learn from around the world. Obama is trying to move the Democrats on from the Clinton years, without making Gore's error of disavowing his own legacy in government.</p> <p>The radical right \u2013 Paul Ryan in the US; David Davis and Liam Fox in the UK \u2013 are on the march, demonising the state,especially the welfare state, as morally and economically bankrupt. We went to Charlotte to learn lessons for our fightback.</p> <p>First, Clinton's demolition of Romney-Ryan economic credibility was a masterclass. We can win the argument for fiscal responsibility \u2013 as long as we distinguish short-term Keynesian stimulus from medium-term prudence. In fact, as Fran\u00e7ois Hollande is discovering, only medium-term prudence and reform gives you the policy space for short-term Keynesian stimulus. Ed Miliband was right this week to dismiss the demand for promises we can't guarantee to keep as \"crackers\".</p> <p>Second, in the wake of the crisis, we need to be state reformers as well as market reformers. In the US it is striking that the anti-government Tea Party has so much more staying power than the anti-market Occupy movement. It is true that there is not a single successful economy today in which government does not play a vital role in driving forward market economies and standing up for the public interest. But there is another truth in the wake of the financial crisis: that government is on trial as well as markets.</p> <p>So we need to be the people doing things differently when there is less money around. That was the lesson from Democratic governors and mayors at the convention. Like Labour in local government in the UK, they are refashioning the way the state does business \u2013 decentralising power, incentivising job creation, switching spending and engaging the voluntary sector \u2013 to achieve progressive outcomes.</p> <p>Third, we win by looking like the whole of the country not just part of it. The Democrats, like Labour, cannot rely only on the New Deal coalition of the organised working class. So they are embracing the rising classes and groups in society such as Latinos and middle-income women. It helps that the Republicans are so aggressively wrong on issues of gay rights, women's rights and minority rights.</p> <p>We won't have that luxury in the same way in Britain \u2013 unless the Tories really lose it culturally as well as economically \u2013 so we have to find new ways to connect our politics with the small businesswoman in Ipswich, the GP in Fleetwood, the personal trainer in Gloucester.</p> <p>Fourth, America shows that money can still buy votes \u2013 and the right have got a lot of it. Romney will outspend Obama in the next two months, just as the Tories outspent Labour 2:1 in the last election. This matters. In Britain there is a structural imperative for Labour to take down the influence of money in politics \u2013 not just as a high- minded recognition of voter concern but out of sheer self-interest. Party funding reform is going nowhere. Labour should again try to reach out to the Lib Dems with the aim of working together to get big money out of politics. Some parts of the current system help us, but overall the Tories are the Party that stands to benefit most from stalemate.</p> <p>The fifth lesson is about how we respond to the overwhelming sense that politics is small when the issues are big. People are fearful about the future. The convention came alive when the politics and speeches were worthy of the scale of the problems. Winning the argument does not win support if the voters have walked away. A politics that talks louder and louder to fewer and fewer people creates only a dangerous vacuum. We win when we offer a politics of building and not just blaming.</p> <p>Finally, Obama should win on 6 November. But we need to get the incumbent here out. We can't rely on David Cameron to throw away power like Nicolas Sarkozy in France.</p> <p>\u2022 Douglas Alexander is the shadow foreign secretary and David Miliband is a former Labour foreign secretary</p>",
  "<p>David Miliband has re-entered the debate about how to put Labour back in government, warning his brother that he will not win the keys to Downing Street by disavowing New Labour, relying too much on working-class votes, or by simply waiting for David Cameron to fail.</p> <p>In a joint article for <em>The</em> <em>Observer </em>with shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander, written from the Democrat convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, the two men say Labour needs to show it is on the side of prosperous middle-class voters as well its working-class base.</p> <p>Urging the Labour leader to learn lessons from US politics, where they say President Obama is moving the Democrats on from the years of Bill Clinton without disavowing his legacy, they argue that Ed Miliband should not disregard the lessons from his party's recent past. Obama and Clinton sealed their political alliance with a bear hug at the Democratic convention last week.</p> <p>They also say Labour, as the Democrats have done, must show it is committed to reform of the state, as well as reform of the markets \u2013 and to economic prudence in the medium term following a burst of Keynesian stimulus advocated by the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls.</p> <p>Their intervention reflects unease on the Blairite wing of the party that the Labour leader is shifting too far left, out of a belief that the financial crisis has created a fundamental change in public attitudes towards rampant wealth creation and unregulated markets. They argue the message has to remain unequivocally in favour of the market economy.</p> <p>\"It is true that there is not a single successful economy today where government does not play a vital role in driving forward market economies and standing up for the public interest,\" they write. \"But there is another truth after the financial crisis: that government is on trial as well as the markets.\"</p> <p>Drawing lessons from the race for the White House ahead of presidential elections in November, they write: \"The Democrats, just like Labour, cannot rely only on the New Deal coalition of the organised working class. So they are supplementing that coalition by embracing the rising classes and groups in society \u2013 notably Latinos, but also middle income women who are the one group in the population, outside the elite, whose income has gone up in the last 30 years.</p> <p>\"It helps the Democrats that the Republicans are so aggressively wrong on issues of gay rights, women's rights and minority rights. We won't have that luxury in the same way here \u2013 unless the Tories really lose it culturally as well as economically \u2013 so we have to find new ways to connect our politics with the small businesswoman in Ipswich, the GP in Fleetwood, the personal trainer in Gloucester.\"</p> <p>Further trouble looms for Ed Miliband as the political conference season gets under way with the TUC congress in Brighton. Several unions, including Labour's biggest financial backer Unite, are calling for more co-ordinated industrial action in the public sector over pay cuts.</p> <p>In an interview with the <em>Observer</em> today, the general secretary elect of the TUC, Frances O'Grady, \u2013 the first woman ever to take on the post \u2013 says the TUC will back co-ordinated strikes if delegates support them. \"If members vote for it then the TUC will stand ready to support them,\" she said. Throwing her support behind Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, who is pushing for an escalation of strikes in the runup to the next election, O'Grady said while the unions shared values with Labour, her duty was to union members and not Ed Miliband. \"Ed Miliband will be leading a political party. I will be leading a trade union movement,\" she said.</p> <p>Controversially, David Miliband and Alexander hint that they would like to see Labour relying less on union money as they call for fundamental reform of party funding.</p> <p>\"In Britain there is a structural imperative for Labour to take down the influence of money in politics \u2013 not just as a high-minded recognition of voter concern, but out of sheer self interest,\" they write.</p> <p>\"At the moment, party funding reform is going nowhere. So this autumn Labour should again reach out to the Liberal Democrats with the aim of working together to get big money out of politics. Some parts of the current system help us, but overall the Tories are the party that stands to benefit most from stalemate.\"</p> <p>A senior Labour source said: \"Ed Miliband agrees with this analysis. Like President Clinton and President Obama, he believes the success of progressive politics lies in bringing people together to make markets work and create a more responsible capitalism.</p> <p>\"He believes that in the face of increasing Tory divisiveness and division, Labour is the party that brings the country together and unites it. He believes that David Cameron has made a big mistake in shifting away from the political centre ground and seeking to blame people for the problems of the country.\"</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama and Mitt Romney took their respective blueprints for America to key electoral battlegrounds Saturday with polls suggesting that the White House race remains neck-and-neck.</p> <p>\"I'm fired up. I'm ready to go forward,\" the president told supporters in Florida, just days after he gave a solid speech to delegates in North Carolina \u2013 but one that failed to deliver a clear polling bounce to elevate him above his Republican challenger.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Romney attempted to capitalise on a Democratic party spat over the wording of its policy platform at the Charlotte meet during his turn on the stump.</p> <p>Referring to a self-inflicted wound caused by the original dropping of any mention to \"God\" in the document, Romney said: \"I will not take God out of the name of our platform. I will not take God off our coins and I will not take God out of my heart.\"</p> <p>The stump speech, delivered in the bible-belt state of Virginia, received cheers, and chants of \"U-S-A, U-S-A\".</p> <p>Warming to the patriotic theme, Romney went on to promise to maintain spending on defence so that the US army was so powerful no other nation would \"dare test it\".</p> <p>In Florida, Obama lambasted the Republican party for not coming up with anything other than \"the same prescription they have had for 30 years\".</p> <p>He summed Romney's platform up as: \"Tax cuts, tax cuts: gut a few regulations, some more tax cuts.\"</p> <p>To growing laughter from supporters, the president continued: \"Tax cuts when times are good, tax cuts when times are bad. Tax cuts to help you lose a few extra pounds, tax cuts to help your love life.\"</p> <p>Both men will be hoping that by hammering their key messages home in battleground states, they may open up a discernible lead \u2013 something both men have failed to do so far in the race.</p> <p>In the latest rash of polls to come out after the Democrats wrapped up a mainly well-reviewed convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, Obama appears to have earned a small \"bounce\".</p> <p>But the lead it gives him is razor-thin.

I think they want to see more jobs, they want to see their kids coming out of college able to get jobs, they want to see rising incomes again,\" he said in a statement.</p> <p>With the race as close as it is, both candidates are now likely to spend little time outside the battleground states in the remaining eight weeks of the campaign.</p>",

  "<p>Both of them have a Spanish-sounding surname. Both have a moving story of poor parents coming to America for a better life. And both recently spoke to the American people from a primetime slot at their party's national convention.</p> <p>But San Antonio mayor Juli\u00e1n Castro and Florida senator Marco Rubio are far from being on the same side. Instead they symbolise the almighty battle for the Hispanic vote between Republicans and Democrats in the 2012 election.</p> <p>Each has been selected as a sort of party champion, sallying forth to do battle for the support of America's 50\u2009\u2009million Latinos, whose votes could decide whether former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney wins the Oval Office or President Barack Obama secures a second term.</p> <p>The contest has pitted two of the youngest rising stars in American politics against each other. Castro is just 37, yet already has a major national profile, prompting comparisons with Obama's own path to the White House. Meanwhile Rubio, 41, is a Tea Party favourite often touted as a future Republican leader who was even widely rumoured to have been considered for Romney's vice-presidential shortlist this year.</p> <p>Both men are the children of immigrants \u2013 from Mexico and Cuba respectively \u2013 and both gave widely praised speeches that wowed their fans. Yet, mirroring the many splits in American Hispanics' own communities, that is where the similarities end. Rubio is a darling of the right wing of the Republican party and beats the drum for slashing government spending. He is staunchly anti-abortion and has said that gay marriage goes against his Christian faith.</p> <p>Castro, meanwhile, has served as the grand marshal in his city's gay rights parade, praises the role of government in society and is the child of a leftist civil-rights-campaigning single mother. Each man therefore represents a radically different vision of what his party thinks will appeal to Hispanic voters. \"Both parties need to show that they are open and attractive to Hispanic voters, but they are not at all a unified bloc,\" said Professor Scott McLean, a political scientist at Quinnipiac University.</p> <p>So far it is a battle that Castro and the Democrats have been winning. In 2008, Latino voters went for Obama by almost 70% and current polling \u2013 though showing a drop in support \u2013 still has the Democrat ahead of Romney by 63% to 28%. In the recent Charlotte party convention, Castro was given the all-important keynote address \u2013 the first Hispanic to fill that spot \u2013 but other Latino party bigwigs were given prominence too. Much was made of Obama's appointment of the first Hispanic woman to the Supreme Court in Sonia Sotomayor, and the president was also lauded for recent moves to lift the threat of deportation from millions of young illegal immigrants brought to the US as children.</p> <p>It is that thorny issue of illegal immigration that is the Democrats' real strength. Though Obama is hardly liberal on the issue, the Republican party has moved far to the right, embracing controversial measures against illegal immigration in states such as Arizona. Yet one study has estimated that some 9.5 million people \u2013 the vast majority of them likely to be Latino \u2013 live in \"mixed\" households where at least one person is illegal. In such homes, harsh Republican rhetoric on immigration is always going to be offputting.</p> <p>\"That is the wedge issue that keeps Latinos from the Republican party,\" said Professor Gabriel Sanchez, an expert in Latino politics at the University of New Mexico.</p> <p>Yet Republican strategists believe they have an ace up their sleeves in the party's embrace of conservative social values that are often shared by many Hispanics, who are often deeply Roman Catholic and family-oriented. Rubio and other leading Republicans, such as Texan Senate candidate Ted Cruz and New Mexico governor Susana Martinez, frequently tout their social values. But it has not been a winner overall, because Latino social conservatism often goes hand-in-hand with a belief in government welfare programmes as a way out of poverty for a demographic often much poorer than its white equivalent. This is especially true as the economic aftershocks of the Great Recession are still being felt while Republicans tout massive cuts to healthcare, education grants and food stamps.</p> <p>\"Who cares about two guys getting married when you want a job?\" said Professor Stephen Nu\u00f1o, a political scientist at Northern Arizona University. \"In the end, a voter is not going to forget Republican hostility and that the party wants to deport their uncle.\"</p> <p>Many experts believe the Republican party faces disaster in the future as Hispanics became an ever more vital part of the electorate. In 2008, some 10.2 million voted, a whopping 25% increase on 2004 (in the early 1990s, only 2% of the electorate was Hispanic). It is a number certain to leap again in 2012.</p> <p>Recent surveys have shown that Hispanics represent more than half of all US population growth over the past decade. Due to a youthful population profile, they already represent one in four Americans under the age of 18. \"The numbers are compelling,\" said Sanchez.</p> <p>So, too, is the geography. One of the fastest areas of Latino population growth is the Republican heartland of the south. If the Republican party does not in some way attract Hispanics, it will face a withering of support even in the reddest of red states. The battle is already on for Texas \u2013 a solidly Republican state that is home to both Castro and Cruz. It is noticeable that Texas's Republican governor, Rick Perry, is already softer on aspects of illegal immigration policy than the Republican mainstream. But if the Republicans are to compete nationally as the voice of Hispanics, if Marco Rubio is to best Julian Castro on the national stage, then the Republican party itself will have to change. \"It has to. But I don't see that that is going to happen for a very long time,\" said Nu\u00f1o.</p>",
  "<p>If the Obama campaign hopes the Democratic convention will renew America's love affair with the president, Dinesh D'Souza has some unwelcome news: his film attacking Obama will reach more than 2,000 cinemas this weekend, putting it on track to be the second most successful documentary of all time.</p> <p>\"The product is selling because people sense there is real information here,\" D'Souza told the Guardian. \"Not allegations, not assertions, but real information that is valuable in assessing the future of the country.\"</p> <p>Democrats leaving Charlotte on Friday fired up for the November 6 election would choke on that claim, and try to dismiss D'Souza as a crank. The trouble is, his film, 2016: Obama's America, is spreading across ever more cinema screens and proving a remarkable box office hit.</p> <p>While party faithful hailed Obama's nomination acceptance speech as an outline for a progressive second term, D'Souza called it part of a covert strategy. \"It's a smoke-and-mirrors performance, because the bottom line is that Obama has a completely different agenda to what he's letting on.\"</p> <p>The president, he said, was pretending to be a tax-cutter and friend of the middle classes and Israel. \"Obama has an ideology that wants to downsize America \u2026 He subscribes to the belief that in terms of wealth and power it would be good for America to have less, and for the rest of the world to have more.\"</p> <p>The president, he said, had duped his own party into thinking he wished to redistribute wealth domestically, when his real goal was redistributing it globally by exporting jobs and wealth. \"He can't afford to let that cat so far out of the bag. He can't afford to come across as the global guy that he obviously is. He wants to pretend to be an all-American guy.\"</p> <p>Democrats who rolled their eyes when D'Souza's film first came out have been stunned by its success. From just a few hundred screens a few weeks ago it jumped to 1,750 last week and is now at more than 2,000. It has earned about $22m, and is set to overtake Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth, coming second only to Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 as the highest-grossing documentary ever.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395844852\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/9/7/1347056247562/A-promotional-poster-is-s-004.jpg\" alt=\"A promotional poster is seen at the Rave\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">2016: Obama's America.

Richards/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 87-minute film follows D'Souza, a conservative, Indian-born scholar, as he traces Obama's roots and \"rage\" to Africa, Hawaii, Indonesia and his absentee, anti-colonial father.</p> <p>It will have a \"second wave\" in the form of DVDs and home box office options in the last three weeks of the election, he said. \"I would suspect that the majority of our attendees are conservative or Republican, but there's a sense that the film is breaking out beyond that group.\"</p> <p>Many critics have savaged the film. \"A work of propaganda that offers base innuendo in lieu of argument,\" <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/movies/2012/09/dinesh-dsouzas-2016-obamas-america.html#ixzz25ordw04h\">said the New Yorker</a>.</p> <p>An Associated Press fact-checking article found the film, a cinematic version of D'Souza's 2010 book The Roots of Obama's Rage, to be \"almost entirely subjective and a logical stretch at best\".</p> <p>But D'Souza, a former thinktank researcher who lives in New York and is president of the Christian liberal arts school The King's College, is unabashed.</p> <p>Obama's speech, he said, continued an effort to mask his real intent. \"I don't think Obama sees decline as a goal in itself, but I think he thinks American decline is necessary for the rise of the rest of the world. I think he thinks there is a limited supply of energy in the world and that America and the west use too much \u2026 others need to have more, otherwise how can they grow?</p> <p>\"Similarly, I think he thinks America has been lording it over the Middle East, and that it's better for America to have a smaller footprint, because it's been stepping on the world.\"</p> <p>That is news to critics on the left who say Obama's occasionally pluralist rhetoric is a sham for continued hawkish foreign policy, such as ramping up the war in Afghanistan and raining drone strikes on terrorist targets in Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen.</p> <p>D'Souza sees it completely differently: Obama believes America is part of the global 1%, and wants to share its wealth and power with \"hungry, circling nations\".</p> <p>It was easy to conceal this agenda in 2008 before Obama took office. \"Now, after four years, he can't come across as the unknown man. He has to actually camouflage what he has done and claim the opposite.\"</p> <p>Thus, the killing of Osama bin Laden and other al-Qaida leaders masked a cossetting of other jihadis whom the president secretly regarded as freedom fighters, he says. \"Obama is weirdly and almost unacceptably solicitous towards those guys,\" D'Souza said, adding that White House rhetoric on winning Afghanistan was hollow.</p> <p>\"Obama seems to have reconciled himself to at least a partial Taliban takeover. In other words: an American defeat.\"</p> <p>Obama, said D'Souza, had turned his back on Hosni Mubarak, Egypt's fallen dictator and US ally, as well as opposition movements in Syria and Iran, while letting Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood take power \u2013 in a democratic election \u2013 and project its influence across the Middle East.</p> <p>\"America's position in the world can hardly be seen as stronger, except in some delusional mode as a result of what Obama has done. America has lost its strong hand in the Middle East.</p> <p>\"And if Saudi Arabia falls during Obama's second term, then we can see the restoration of Islam as a global power. Which we haven't seen in 200 years.\"</p> <p>D'Souza interpreted Obama's remark to the Russian leader Dimitri Medvedev that he would have more flexibility in a second term as admission of a hidden agenda. \"We'll see an even more radical Obama, because he won't be tethered to public opinion as much.\"</p> <p>Left-wing Democrats shared the president's belief that the US was a rogue nation needing taming, D'Souza said. \"They kind of know that Obama is pursuing decline. And they want decline \u2026 that's why they like him.\" Mainstream Democrats, he said, turned a blind eye out of opportunism.</p> <p>Asked if he wanted Obama to win so he could proved right, D'Souza laughed. \"I am neither predicting nor advocating an election outcome.\"</p> <p>Hollywood, he said, had been shocked by the success of the film, which he co-directed with John Sullivan. It was shot on a shoestring budget, edited in Oklahoma City and distributed independently. \"They're a little unnerved because we kind of came out of nowhere. It shows that Hollywood has no monopoly on the making and distribution of good films.\" He shrugged off criticism that it was funded by rich conservatives. \"My answer is: well, we tried to be funded by poor conservatives, but that failed, so we had to turn to the rich ones. Big deal. Who cares?\"</p> <p>D'Souza laughed at being called a right-wing Michael Moore, but said he was inspired by the panache and commercial splash of Fahrenheit 9/11's assault on a sitting president.</p> <p>\"That being said, in my opinion Fahrenheit 9/11 is an intellectual nullity. It's factually slippery, based on conspiracy theories, and it's fast and loose with data. Our film is not that way.\" Many critics disagree, though stylistically D'Souza's scholarly, understated demeanour contrasts with Moore's megaphone stunts.</p> <p>In a tight race, Democrats can only hope that for all the fuss Obama's America will not tilt key states Mitt Romney's way.</p> <p>D'Souza's kindest words about Obama still have potential to fire up Republican voters. \"He doesn't hate America. He's not a Manchurian candidate. He's not even anti-American. It's just that he subscribes to the belief that in terms of wealth and power it would be good for America to have less and for the rest of the world to have more.\"</p>"
