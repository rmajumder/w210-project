First off the blocks is The Orphan Of Zhao, the first Chinese play to be translated in the west and which is presented here in a version by James Fenton. With origins dating back to the fourth century, the piece (sometimes known as The Chinese Hamlet) tells of a young man who, in the wake of a violent coup, discovers the truth of his background and sets out to take his revenge.</p> <p><strong><em>The Swan, Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Tue to 26 Mar</em></strong></p> <p><em>LG</em></p> <h2>Nosferatu, London</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398407884\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/25/1351169259918/Noeferatu-008.jpg\" alt=\"Noeferatu\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Marta Orlik-Gaillard</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marta Orlik-Gaillard</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Halloween shivers are guaranteed at the Barbican, with one of the highlights of its 2012 programme the third visit of Poland's TR Warszawa company, this time with a production of Nosferatu, inspired by Bram Stoker's Dracula.

Golding had a close connection with Salisbury. He lived in the city and taught at Bishop Wordsworth's grammar school in the Cathedral Close. It also provided him with the inspiration for The Spire which tells the story of Dean Jocelin and the men who envisaged building a 400-foot spire on Salisbury Cathedral, in spite of the fact that no one had ever built that high, the cathedral had no foundations, and there was no money. Gareth Machin directs a local story on an epic scale, adapted here by Roger Spottiswoode.</p> <p><strong><em>Salisbury Playhouse, Thu to 24 Nov</em></strong></p> <p><em>LG</em></p> <h2>Orpheus Descending, Manchester</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398407886\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/25/1351169563744/Orpheus-Descending-008.jpg\" alt=\"Orpheus Descending\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Imogen Stubbs.

But with the current US president being a black man espousing liberal values, it would seem that a great deal has changed since Williams's depiction of small-town life in America's deep south in the 1940s. Or has it? Frankcom's production aims to hold up a mirror to the contemporary world and maybe even to the hate crimes of modern America. She tells the story of a young drifter who arrives in a small town with nothing but a guitar and who manages to form a relationship with Lady Torrance, an unhappy woman trapped in a loveless marriage. She's played by Imogen Stubbs who scored a hit at the same theatre last year as Amanda in Private Lives.</p> <p><strong><em>Royal Exchange Theatre, to 24 Nov</em></strong></p> <p><em>LG</em></p> <h2>Daddy Long Legs, London</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398407887\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/25/1351169713048/daddy-long-legs-008.jpg\" alt=\"daddy long legs\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Adelman Hancock and Megan McGinnis</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeanee Tanner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>John Caird, who co-directed Les Mis\u00e9rables and Nicholas Nickleby with Trevor Nunn, returns to the musical stage with a show of his own at London's newest theatre.

  "<p>Forget the perverted murders, the unwitting necrophilia and the demonic babies. The juiciest scene in American Horror Story's wacky first season was a deliciously acidic dialogue duel between Jessica Lange's maniacal matriarch and Zachary Quinto's gay ghost. Chastising him for planning to steal twin babies and raise them with his boyfriend (also a ghost), she piles on the fire and brimstone. He battles her homophobia with sardonic wit.</p> <p>\"Men shall not lie with men. It is an abomination,\" she spits.</p> <p>\"So is that hairdo,\" he lobs back, \"but I figure that's your business.\"</p> <p>After appearing in just four of that season's 12 episodes, Quinto has been promoted to co-lead, as a psychiatrist pitted directly against Lange, now playing a demonic nun, in season two. While many of the cast members are back, the world is entirely new. This time we're in 1964, in an asylum for the criminally insane, with the series promising to be darker, more chilling and more adult. The fresh start is, well, refreshing. Co-creator <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2011/nov/05/a-good-week-for-ryan-murphy\" title=\"\">Ryan Murphy</a> says some big-name cinema actors, who wouldn't normally work in TV because of the time commitment, have been sniffing around, eager to get involved for a season, and the appeal is clear.</p> <p>\"Ryan came to me in the middle of last season and told me his plan,\" says Quinto, from his LA home. \"It got me so excited because that doesn't really happen on American television, where actors essentially become part of a repertory company and get to create different characters and entirely different worlds and tell different stories. One of the big challenges of television is, if it's a successful series that one finds themselves on, you can be stuck there, playing the same character for seven years, and that can be really limiting. This is the best formula to solve that.\"</p> <h2>'I think any American that is LGBT, or loves someone who is LGBT, or supports someone who is LGBT, has only one choice in this election'</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mbDxr3NDZhc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mbDxr3NDZhc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mbDxr3NDZhc\">Reading this on mobile? Click here to view</a></p> <p>After serving time on the likes of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/six-feet-under\" title=\"\">Six Feet Under</a> and 24, Quinto played supernatural serial killer Sylar on Heroes for four years. The show launched an actor, who \u2013 fictional superpowers aside \u2013 looks somehow tweaked, airbrushed, otherworldly, with eyes so powerfully transfixing they threaten to bore holes through your screen. While Heroes made him a TV star, JJ Abrams's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/star-trek\" title=\"\">Star Trek</a>, which Quinto stole with a wonderfully warm take on the half-human Spock, made him a cinema star; his charismatic turn was very much the heart of the film.</p> <p>For some time, Quinto has been using his growing celebrity status to support social and political causes. He's hugely supportive of Obama and is currently on the campaign trail, he says, spending as much time as he can on the road. Two days before the Guardian speaks to him, he appears on an emotional <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEzSaQgbM6s\" title=\"\">YouTube video</a> for Obama Pride: LGBT Americans For Obama, in which he endorses the President for re-election. \"Having the president of the United States declare his belief that gay couples should be allowed to marry and to use the word marry \u2026 it was incredibly inspiring to watch that all unfold,\" says Quinto on the video.</p> <p>\"I was really proud to be a part of that,\" he says. \"I think any American that is LGBT, or loves someone who is LGBT, or supports someone who is LGBT, has only one choice in this election, because the differences between these two candidates on that issue alone are so diametrically opposed. Mitt Romney actively seeks to roll back progress that we have all made and fought so hard to make, and to me that's just not acceptable.\"</p> <p>Quinto came out, subtly and gracefully, in an interview with New York magazine a year ago. \"I had been thinking about it all the time for a while, just sort of peripherally,\" he says. \"I knew it was something I wanted to do and I knew I needed to make sure that the moment was right for me. So it was my voice, the way it happened was authentic.\"</p> <p>He's subsequently received \"an overwhelming wave of support,\" he says, and is naturally gratified when people give him personal accounts of how it's helped them and made a difference. He had already been pro-active with LGBT suicide-prevention organisation the <a href=\"http://www.thetrevorproject.org/\" title=\"\">Trevor Project</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.itgetsbetter.org/\" title=\"\">It Gets Better</a> initiative, among others, but it must be exciting for him to be able to lend his support with his cards on the table. \"Yeah, it's true actually,\" he says. \"I feel like being able to speak with a more authentic voice now gives me a stronger sense of purpose, and it's a big part of the reason why I made the decision to stand up and come out, to be able to make any kind of positive change in the world. The LGBT community means a great deal to me, and an even greater deal to me now.\"</p> <h2>'Ooh, slash fiction, I see, yes, yes.

Photograph: Allstar</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/PARAMOUNT/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In career terms, he doesn't choose projects based on their political standpoints, he says, although he is \"interested in socially relevant work\", and formed his production company to enable him to tell stories he wants to tell. Certainly, many of his acting projects fit snugly with his social views, if not overtly. The new season of American Horror Story may be a scare-fest set in an asylum, but the first episode alone tackles prejudice about same-sex couples and mixed marriages, while Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry's mission was always to explore social issues and to push for progress. With or without the Spock ears, Quinto very much seems to be on the same page.</p> <p>Spock himself \u2013 or at least Spock v1, Leonard Nimoy, who memorably starred alongside Quinto in Abrams's film \u2013 had casting approval for the character, and the pair forged a close bond soon after they met in 2007. Quinto wanted to draw from Nimoy himself and a surrogate father-son relationship is evident in videos of them together. \"We're very close and we spend a fair amount of time together if we're both in town,\" says Quinto, clearly very fond of him. \"We keep in very close touch, I see him and his wife often. I take a lot of care to keep them involved in what's going on for me, and they do the same.\"</p> <p>Quinto is immensely proud to be a part of the Trek world, and speaks enthusiastically about the sequel <a href=\"http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=35405\" title=\"\">Star Trek Into Darkness</a>, which hits screens next May. \"It was a much bigger experience,\" he says. \"We shot it in 3D and in Imax. It's bolder. I'm excited to see it come together.\"</p> <p>He's not alone: Star Trek remains huge; today's fans are reassuringly rabid, and the day we speak is the opening day of the Destination Star Trek London convention (in which William Shatner, when asked on stage what addition he would like to have made to the captain's chair, suggested a toilet). I ask Quinto if he's heard the editing job a couple of fans did with his Star Trek audiobook, cutting his words into a slice of extremely <a href=\"http://io9.com/5430785/zachary-quinto-fulfills-your-trek-slash-fantasies\" title=\"\">filthy Spock/Kirk slash fiction</a>.</p> <p>\"Ooh, slash fiction, I see, yes, yes.\" He hasn't heard it. \"I myself am not very well-versed in the world of slash fiction,\" he says, marvelling at the time one would have had to spend to edit his perfectly innocent eight-hour recording into three minutes of steamy grot. \"That kind of time is a luxury that I don't have in any way. But more power to them, I suppose.\"</p>",

  "<p>A state of emergency was declared in some areas along the US east coast on Friday as experts warned Hurricane Sandy could contribute to a storm of \"historic\" proportions.</p> <p>The hurricane left 41 people dead as it passed through the Caribbean and headed north. Sandy could strike the US coastline anywhere between Virginia and Massachusetts as early as Monday.</p> <p>Meteorologists warned that weather conditions could be complicated as Sandy is expected to meet two separate weather systems somewhere over the north-east United States, resulting in high winds, heavy rain, extreme tides and perhaps even snow.</p> <p>\"It's looking like a very serious storm that could be historic,\" said Jeff Masters, meteorology director of the forecasting service Weather Underground. He compared the convergence of weather systems to the so-called \"perfect storm\" that struck off the coast of New England in 1991, although that storm hit a less populated area.</p> <p>On Friday afternoon, the centre of the hurricane was moving slowly north around 430 miles south-southeast off the coast of South Carolina. Sandy was moving at 7mph with maximum sustained winds near 75mph. Forecasters said there was a 90% certainty that storm would make landfall on the east coast, althought it was too early to predict where it would come ashore.</p> <p>Parts of Jamaica, Haiti and Cuba were left devastated as the hurricane swept over on Thursday and Friday, leaving at least 41 people dead. In Cuba, 11 people were killed in eastern Santiago and Guantanamo provinces, as authorities said Sandy was Cuba's deadliest storm since July 2005. One person died as Sandy passed through Jamaica and 16 were left dead in Haiti, where heavy rains from the storm's outer bands caused flooding in the impoverished and deforested country. A 66-year-old man died in the Bahamas after falling from his roof in upscale Lyford Cay late Thursday, as he attempted to repair a window shutter.</p> <p>New York, Virginia and Maryland declared states of emergency on Friday. In Virginia, where Mitt Romney cancelled a rally planned for Sunday night, Governor Bob McDonnell told people to prepare ahead of the storm's arrival, warning that the state \"could see severe weather lasting for 48 hours or more\".</p> <p>\"In that scenario, saturated soil coupled with high winds could lead to major tree damage and extensive power outages,\" <a href=\"http://www.dailypress.com/news/gloucester-county/gloucester-blog/dp-virginia-governor-declares-state-of-emergency-20121026,0,4553509.story \">McDonnell said</a>. \"Virginians should make sure their family members, friends and neighbours are prepared for this extended weather event. I encourage all Virginians to gather batteries, blankets, water, canned goods, and other necessities prior to the anticipated onset of storm conditions late Saturday and early Sunday.\"</p> <p>New York City<a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/new-york-prepares-sandy-pounds-bahamas-article-1.1193028#ixzz2ARMzXP00 \"> mayor Mike Bloomberg said </a>he would wait until Saturday before potentially issuing an evacuation order, but warned that the storm was moving at such a rate that \"we're still not going to have a good sense of when and where it's going to hit land\". The last major storm to threaten the northeast coast was Hurricane Irene which caused an estimated $15.8bn in damage in August last year, making it one of the costliest storms in history.</p> <p>Bloomberg said that bridges may have to be closed in New York. The MTA suspends subway, bus and other transit services in advance of the arrival of sustained winds at 39mph or higher, he said, while power outages are also a possibility.</p> <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Friday that wherever the storm comes ashore, there will be 10in (254mm) of rain and extreme storm surges. Up to 2ft (0.6m) of snow should fall on West Virginia, with lighter snow in parts of Ohio and Pennsylvania.</p> <p>\"It's going to be a long-lasting event, two to three days of impact for a lot of people,\" said James Franklin, forecast chief for the National Hurricane Center.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama received a pre-election boost on Friday when the latest economic figures showed a higher-than-expected rise in growth as both the Democratic and Republican teams stepped up efforts to break the deadlock before November 6.</p> <p>The growth was fuelled by rising consumer confidence, the fledgling recovery in the housing market and an uptick in government spending.</p> <p>The worry for Democrats is that the favourable figures may be arriving too late to have a big impact on the election.</p> <p>Obama and Republican presidential challenger Mitt Romney are stuck on 47% each in the polls, according to the average of polls on Real Clear Politics, and looking for an issue that will tip the balance in their favour in the final days of the campaign.</p> <p>There are big variations between individual polls, with the latest Gallup daily tracking poll putting Romney back up five points, on 51% to Obama's 46%.</p> <p>A CNN poll in Ohio, which has emerged as the pivotal state of the election, attracting more visits by the candidates than any other, shows Obama is on 50% to Romney's 46%. Republican senator Rob Portman, who is co-chair of Romney's campaign, admitted on NBC that it would be hard for Romney to win the White House without Ohio.</p> <p>Romney delivered a speech in Ames, Iowa, another swing state, what his aides had billed as a major address on the economic but in fact contained nothing new in terms of policy. He had one fresh rhetorical line, rehearsed by the Romney campaign in an ad earlier in the week, in which he accused Obama of focusing on trivial issues because he had no record worth fighting the election on.</p> <p>\"This is an election of consequence. Our campaign is about big things, because we happen to believe that America faces big challenges. We recognise this is a year with a big choice, and the American people want to see big changes. And together we can bring real change to this country,\" Romney said.</p> <p>\"Four years ago, candidate Obama spoke to the scale of the times. Today, he shrinks from it, trying instead to distract our attention from the biggest issues to the smallest, from characters on Sesame Street and silly word games to misdirected personal attacks he knows are false.\"</p> <p>He then returned to what is basically his stump speech.</p> <p>Although the election has been largely dominated by the economy, it has broadened to encompass social issues, mainly abortion and rape, and, more recently, racial tensions.</p> <p>On abortion and rape, the Obama campaign put out a new web page with a clock marking how long Romney has maintained his endorsement of Indiana senate candidate Richard Mourdock who on Tuesday said that that pregnancies from rape are \"something that God intended\". It follows a claim by another Republican senate candidate, Todd Akin, in Missouri, who used the phrase \"legitimate rape\".</p> <p>On race, the former governor of New Hampshire, John Sununu \u2013&#xa0;a leading Romney surrogates \u2013 was forced to go into reverse after suggesting that Colin Powell, a secretary of state in the George W Bush administration, had endorsed Obama simply because he is black.</p> <p>Democrats claimed this was not an off-the-cuff remark but part of a deliberate strategy on the part of the Romney campaign to make race an issue. A Washington Post poll this week showed fewer whites supporting Obama in this election than in 2008.</p> <p>Obama's 2008 opponent John McCain beat him among white voters by 12 points. According to the Washington Post poll, Obama is trailing Romney among whites by 23 points.</p> <p>On Friday, Sununu backtracked over his remark about Powell's endorsement. \"Colin Powell is a friend and I respect the endorsement decision he made and I do not doubt that it was based on anything but his support of the president's policies,\" Sununu, a former White House chief of staff, said.</p> <p>On Thursday night, speaking on CNN, Sununu had said: \"Frankly, when you take a look at Colin Powell, you have to wonder if that's an endorsement based on issues, or whether he's got a slightly different reason for preferring president Obama?\" Asked what reason that might be, Sununu said: \"Well, I think when you have somebody of your own race that you're proud of being president of the United States, I applaud Colin for standing with him.\"</p> <p>Tad Devine, a senior adviser to the Gore campaign in 2000 and Kerry in 2004, saw this as part of a Republican strategy aimed at making race part of the campaign. \"I believe there is a systematic effort on the part of the Republican party to introduce a racial component into this election \u2026 I don't think this is accidently shooting off at the mouth.\"</p> <p>Obama, speaking to Democratic campaign workers in his hometown Chicago on Thursday night before flying back to Washington, acknowledged that the race is close and that he might lose, while adding he still expected to win.</p> <p>\"This is going to be a close election, so we just got to work really hard over these next 12 days. If we let up and our voters don't turn out, we could lose this election,\" Obama said:.\"Now the good news is, if our voters do turn out, we will definitely win the election.\"</p> <p>The president spent Friday in the White House doing 10 interviews, mainly with media from the swing states that will decide the outcome on November 6, while Romney continued his campaign tour in Iowa and Ohio.</p> <p>The White House welcomed the news from the department of commerce on economic growth. Although the economy remains sluggish, this was the 13th straight month of growth.</p> <p>Alan Krueger, chairman of the White House council of economic advisers, said that over those 13 months the economy had expanded by 7.2% overall.</p> <p>\"While we have more work to do, together with other economic indicators, this report provides further evidence that the economy is moving in the right direction.,\" he said.</p> <p>The figures on growth, the last from the commerce department before the election, come after unemployment statistics released earlier this month showed a drop below the symbolically important 8%. The next unemployment figures are due just before polling day.</p> <p>Romney described the growth figures as discouraging. \"Slow economic growth means slow job growth and declining take-home pay. This is what four years of president Obama's policies have produced. Americans are ready for change \u2014 for growth, for jobs, for higher take-home pay,\" he said in a statement.</p> <p>In spite of the increase in consumer confidence, businesses are reining themselves in, worried about the so-called 'fiscal cliff\" at the end of the year when Bush-era tax cuts are due to expire and massive spending cuts scheduled to kick in unless there is a political compromise.</p> <p>With 10 days left to the election, the Obama campaign claims to have a slight edge in the swing states and to have stopped the momentum that Romney built up after his debate victory in Denver on December 3. The Romney campaign insisted that the momentum is still with them, bringing into play more states, such as Wisconsin.</p>",

She specifically called out Missouri Republican representative Todd Akin who said in August that the female body is constructed to minimize the chance of getting pregnant from rape. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"Todd Akin claims that women can't really get pregnant from a legitimate rape because the body secretes hormones. Now I can't even finish this sentence without getting dumber; it's making me dumber when I say it \u2013 but it's something about the body not being able to get pregnant when it's under physical stress. Mr Akin, I think you are confusing the phrase 'legitimate rape' with the phrase 'competitive gymnastics'.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Conservatives have pretty much abandoned Akin, so her comments passed by without much controversy.

  "<p>Heaven knows the British are poorly placed to moan about others' rigged electoral rules. But for all the follies of our first-past-the-post, by imagining a general election as 650 entirely separate constituency ballots you at least see how it might once have made sense. Not so with US electoral college, which somehow makes it possible for the laggard to emerge as the winner in a single, two-horse \u2013 as the world learned to its cost when George W Bush snatched the White House from Al Gore, despite having amassed <a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2000/prespop.htm\" title=\"\">half a million fewer votes</a>. You might just about argue (though <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/oct/11/should-we-have-new-constitutional-convention/?pagination=false\" title=\"\">polls find most Americans don't</a>) that carrying states as opposed to mere voters is important in a federal system; the difficulty is that the individual electors who make up the college are perfectly free under the constitution to disregard opinion in their state. This is not a theoretical problem \u2013 in half of <a href=\"http://archive.fairvote.org/e_college/faithless.htm\" title=\"\">postwar presidential polls</a> some \"<a href=\"http://www.law.northwestern.edu/lawreview/v100/n1/121/LR100n1Bennett.pdf\" title=\"\">faithless elector</a>\" has strayed from their democratic mandate. They exploit a liberty conferred by the founding fathers, who fondly imagined it would stave off the emergence of partisan politics. The last ditch defence is that what counts is what works. Even before the younger Bush, however, there were blots on the historical record, with the foiling of <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/andrewjackson\" title=\"\">Andrew Jackson</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.270towin.com/1824_Election/\" title=\"\">first run</a>, and the near-scuppering of <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/thomasjefferson\" title=\"\">Thomas Jefferson</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.270towin.com/1800_Election/\" title=\"\">second</a>. For all this, if the state-by-state stitch-up saves the world from President Romney, the world's liberals will no doubt find it in their hearts to forgive the college its quirks.</p>",
  "<p>Of the two big political transitions ahead of us next month, it is clear which will receive most attention and be the easiest to read. The US presidential election, in spite of some uncertainties about Mr Romney's real position on many issues, is a straightforward and dramatic electoral contest. It will be comprehensively covered everywhere, and its outcome exhaustively analysed. The replacement of China's leadership at the 18th party congress, a couple of days after the American vote, is, by contrast, already foreordained. It looks like Chinese business as usual, and will be an almost entirely opaque process, as unclear in its implications after it is over as it is before it has begun. Yet it is arguably the more important of the two.</p> <p>This is not because China is a bigger power than America, which it is not, and which it may never become. It is because China's accumulated problems are so numerous and its need for reform and renewal so evident that the course its leaders set in the next five years could be more critical for the world than the choices a single American president will make in the four years at his disposal. Ever since it became possible to talk about Chinese politics in something like western terms, outsiders have hoped for reforms that will take the country in the direction of the rule of law and democracy, and reduce its dependence on a combination of nationalism and consumerism as a source of legitimacy. So have many, although it is unclear how many, Chinese. These expectations have usually been disappointed, because both the party and the people in China are frightened of too much change \u2013 the party because it worries that it will lose its grip, and ordinary people because of the memory of the chaos and cruelty of earlier times. However angry they are about official corruption and mismanagement, they fear any lurch into the unknown.</p> <p>Corruption is a key to many aspects of the Chinese situation. As the distinguished British sinologist Roderick MacFarquhar recently argued, high-level Chinese corruption is not just theft. Together with the export of assets abroad, and the despatch of sons and daughters to foreign schools and universities, it suggests that the party brass lacks <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/21/opinion/in-china-fear-at-the-top.html\" title=\"\">confidence in the future</a>. Mao and the other earlier leaders had won the war against the nationalists, created a pervasive and effective party apparatus, and spread an ideology which was widely accepted. All of this is now in the distant past, to the point that, as MacFarquhar writes: \"Globalising one's assets\u2026 makes sense as a hedge against risk.\" The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/business/global/family-of-wen-jiabao-holds-a-hidden-fortune-in-china.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">revelations</a> in the New York Times this week about the wealth amassed by the family of Wen Jiabao, the Chinese premier, will undoubtedly find their way past the state's information filters, and their impact will be the more severe because he has been a relatively popular leader. The<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/26/bo-xilai-expelled-chinese-parliament\" title=\"\"> expulsion </a>of the disgraced Bo Xilai from the party and, yesterday, from parliament, for, among other offences, corruption, is hardly likely to convince a sceptical populace that China's leaders are ready to clean up their act.</p> <p>But that is what a new leadership must do, if it is to transform a society \"unstable at the grass roots, dejected in the middle strata, and out of control at the top\", which is how some Chinese scholars apparently described their country at a recent <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21565132-china%E2%80%99s-communist-party-preparing-its-ten-yearly-change-leadership-new-team\" title=\"\">conference</a> near Shanghai. Similarly, Deng Yuwen, a senior editor at one of the party's journals, has argued that the achievements of the last decade of growth may be outweighed by its failures, especially the <a href=\"http://www.globalpost.com/dispatches/globalpost-blogs/america-the-gutted/china-middle-class-economic-growth-wealth-disparity\" title=\"\">\"failure to nurture and grow a middle class\".</a> The most serious failure of all, as the Chinese writer <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2100133,00.html\" title=\"\">Yu Hua</a> has said, is the erosion of political belief and meaning to the point where, as he suggests, the phrase \"the people\" has become \"nothing more than a shell company, utilised by different eras to position different products in the marketplace\". Put that way, there is indeed a long way to go in China.</p>",
  "<p>Education is crucial to the future of the US, both as a gateway to the middle class and to secure a competitive edge in the global talent pool. Both Democrats and Republicans are concerned that rising tuition is putting college out of reach for too many people \u2013 potentially blighting the country's future prosperity as higher education expands rapidly around the world. Both parties are concerned by international comparisons that show the academic performance of US high school students is relatively mediocre. But when it comes to solving these problems, there are marked differences between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney.</p> <p>In schools, the president has pushed for increased accountability for teachers, by tying teacher evaluations to students' results in standardized tests. He has promoted charter schools, which are state-funded but independently run, giving parents an alternative to traditional public schools.</p> <p>Romney supports both these goals, but is also keen to provide federal cash for school vouchers that would educate children in private or religious schools at public expense.</p> <p>In higher education, the Republicans want to narrow the focus of the Pell Grant programme, which supports the poorest students. Romney also wants to loosen regulations on for-profit colleges, relying on competition to keep tuition costs down.</p> <p>Obama has raised the maximum Pell Grant award for the next academic year, and campaigned to persuade Congress to keep interest rates down on federal loans. He wants to curb the cost of tuition by using federal money to reward colleges that keep tuition affordable.</p> <p>In a three-part series, we explore the changing face of schools and universities in the US. The series looks at K12 education in New Orleans, where a a majority of schools are now charters and a voucher scheme allows tax dollars to follow children into private education. It examines school reforms begun in Florida, which have now inspired change across the country. And as states slash spending on higher education, it looks at the threats facing the public university system.</p>",
  "<p>The teacher's command of his class is total. \"Which one is the whole number?\" he asks crisply. \"Is it seven over three, or is it four?\"</p> <p>He zeroes in on a child who gives the right answer, then the next task: \"Seven over three divided by four over one? Hands, please \u2013 I'm looking for straight arms.\"</p> <p>The classes at Sci Academy, a charter school in New Orleans, feel like an assembly line; with each task stripped down to component parts, and the teacher orchestrating a brisk interaction that draws in students' bodies as well as their minds. They click fingers as a substitute for applause, or to show understanding, and sit poised to attention as the teacher moves around the room.</p> <p>New Orleans is a city that has been failed by government in the past, most tragically when Katrina struck. But one consequence of that disaster has been a root-and-branch transformation of its education system. </p> <p>The reforms had begun before Katrina, but the pace was accelerated after the disaster. It is now the only US city where a majority of public school pupils \u2013 around eight in ten \u2013 attend charter schools, which are non-unionised and enjoy a rare degree of operational independence from government.</p> <p>This academic year brings further change; under reforms brought in by Republican governor Bobby Jindal, poorer students attending poorly performing state schools can apply for vouchers to cover their fees at a private or religious school. Nearly 5,000 students in Louisiana have taken up the voucher programme, making it one of the most popular such initiatives nationally. Similar experiments are underway in several other states including Indiana and Ohio.</p> <p>The creation of a fully-fledged market in education is endorsed by Mitt Romney. If elected, the Republican candidate would provide $25bn in federal money to back school voucher systems.</p> <p>In education, as in health, vouchers are a dividing line between the parties. President Obama has embraced charter schools and increased accountability for teachers, but stops short of letting public money follow children to private schools.</p> <p>The pale blue corridors of Sci Academy, housed in a cluster of prefabricated blocks in New Orleans East, are lined with inspirational mottoes: \"Chase perfection, catch excellence,\" reads one. Another declares: \"We're never done, we're never finished\".</p> <p>The words are directed at students, but could apply just as well to the teachers, who are evaluated on each lesson. Staff here are regularly observed and receive constant feedback on their performance. Closer scrutiny of teachers \u2013 particularly the linking of evaluation to standardised test results \u2013 has been controversial nationally; it was one of the issues at stake in the Chicago teachers' strike.</p> <p>The goal in New Orleans is to reverse years of educational decline. Before Katrina, state schools here had become starkly segregated on race and class lines as white and middle class families removed their children.</p> <p>By 2004 one in three New Orleans students was at a private or religious school, compared with a national average of 11%. In high school exit exams that year, 96% of the city's public school students were below basic proficiency in English.</p> <p>In the years since Katrina, student performance in tests has improved, and fewer students now go to failing schools. Students have achieved a higher average score in the ACT test, which measures readiness for college.</p> <p><a href=\" http://www.coweninstitute.com/\">A study by the Cowen Institute</a> at Tulane University notes the improvement, but is cautious about the reasons why. Many claims have been put forward \"but few have been proven by the available data,\" it says.</p> <p>John White, Louisiana's state superintendent of education, argues that decentralisation has freed schools to act in children's best interests. Charter schools, state-funded but independently run by non-profit groups, are now the norm in New Orleans. In the past school year, 78% of public school students were enrolled in charters. The proportion will rise this year. Such schools enjoy great flexibility in managing their time and allocating resources.</p> <p>White said: \"A lot of this is about ensuring that parents don't leave. It's really not the state that is the best vehicle for keeping parents in our schools, it's the schools, and how do you do that? You create a policy environment where choice is the norm, where schools have the freedom to improve and retain parents. We have a choice and competition model, where schools are competing for the interest of parents.\"</p> <p>In the New Orleans school market, where parents are purchasers and schools tout for custom, the state's role is increasingly to act as a regulator rather than a provider of services.</p> <p>In an attempt to ensure that schools don't game the system, a unified system of enrolment has been introduced for the whole city, with places at oversubscribed schools decided by lottery rather than how close the family lives. Schools must abide by the same rules on exclusions. A network of school buses provides transport, enabling families to choose a school distant from their home.</p> <p>Parents are motivated by a range of inducements, not just a school's academic achievement. Ava Lee, director of the Samuel J Green charter school, says some are attracted to the extended school day, in which children are offered a range of sporting and cultural activities from flag football to African dance. Others appreciate the school's healthy eating ethos; it has an \"edible schoolyard\" growing aubergines, kale, chillies and strawberries. Learning how to cook and eat healthily is on the curriculum here.</p> <p>Lee said: \"Schools receive a report card now, parents are savvy \u2013 they research online and see how a school is performing. It's no longer the neighbourhood school; it's really parent choice.\"</p> <p>The most controversial aspect of the Louisiana reforms is the extension of school choice outside the public system. A pilot voucher programme has existed in New Orleans since 2008, but has been expanded statewide under measures signed into law by Governor Jindal in April. Unlike the pilot, the new programme is open to children from kindergarten to 12th grade. Places at private schools are assigned by lottery and the state voucher covers tuition fees.</p> <h2>The new programme</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398427478\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/10/26/1351259438636/Sci-Academy-in-New-Orlean-010.jpg\" alt=\"Sci Academy in New Orleans\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sci Academy in New Orleans. Photograph: Julie Dermansky for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julie Dermansky/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p></p> <p>Jack Loup, founder of the Coalition for Louisiana Public Education, argues that there is no evidence to support the view that private schools are better.</p> <p>\"They [private schools] have never taken any tests. I went to a parochial [church] school. I certainly have nothing against them. But they don't take any tests to prove they are doing better than other schools. All they have done is throw it out there, saying parents know what's best for their child \u2013 parents have no idea how well the school is teaching their child.\"</p> <p>The initiative has meant a significant boost to the enrolment of schools like the Life of Christ Christian Academy, a non-denominational religious school in New Orleans. The school, a neat brick cube in a neighbourhood of pastel-coloured shotgun houses, is now \"75% vouchers\", according to its principal and owner Cheryl Leufroy Frilot.</p> <p>She acknowledged that the religious setting is uncomfortable for some, but said her small class sizes and relaxed teaching style are attractive to many parents. The annual cost of tuition is around $6,000 for this academic year.</p> <p>Frilot said: \"It's a free place \u2013 they can come and be who they are. Its not robotic, not military-oriented.\"</p> <p>Many parents are drawn to the moral values she instils, Frilot said, as well as valuing her \"no-nonsense\" reputation. \"What they say is: if your child's having problems, take them to Miss Frilot.\"</p> <p>Religious education here takes the form of a Bible studies class rather than comparative faith, but science is never censored, Frilot said. \"We teach evolution, we teach reproduction. I'm not saying [religion] is the only way.\"</p> <p>Private schools that accept the vouchers must enter those students for the same standardised tests taken by public schools. If they fail to reach the bar set for state schools, they face removal from the programme.</p> <p>In Louisiana, the state sets clear limits on the marketplace. In the end, accountability to its testing regime trumps choice: the government will close a chronically underperforming public school even if parents continue to choose it.</p> <p>Neerav Kingsland, chief strategy officer of the not-for-profit group New Schools for New Orleans, likens it to licensing restaurants.</p> <p>\"If a restaurant is violating health codes, even if people want to go there, we're going to close the restaurant. If some schools are performing so bad on tests, even if parents want to got there it's a civic duty to close that option.\"</p> <p>Granting schools greater autonomy is regarded as vital to the health of the system. Freeing schools from central control \u2013 chiefly by setting up charters \u2013 has been a hallmark of education reform in the US, embraced by the leaders of both parties.</p> <p>With this freedom comes the latitude to tailor a bespoke approach to complex problems, White said.</p> <p>\"We have a school in the ninth ward where the principal has decided that he's going to serve breakfast, lunch and dinner to each child. He and I worked together in New York; we were joking about what would happen if we tried to do that in the New York City system.</p> <p>\"Not only would the teacher union say it was a violation of contract, but the food service would say: 'We don't do dinner'. Security would say: 'Yes, but we have to pay for the per diem', the electricity company would say: 'No, we shut school buildings down at this hour.' My point is that when you run systems on a basis where you have these monolithic contracts, they almost by their nature ignore the complexities of schools.\"</p> <p>In common with conservative education reforms across the US, New Orleans schools have come under increased competitive pressure while facing tight spending settlements.</p> <p>In particular, the Recovery School District \u2013 a group of underperforming Louisiana schools which have been taken over by the state government \u2013 is making \"significant cuts\" in expenditure, according to the Cowen Institute.</p> <p>Loup, of the Coalition for Louisiana Public Education, said: \"The money the state provides to our school system has not been increased in four years. That increase is what allows the school system to handle the increasing costs that we receive every year, for retirement, for healthcare, for the gas that goes on the bus. That's the biggest thing that's holding our school system back.</p> <p>\"Every time you take that money away, it's taking away programmes that help those who need it the most. It means the schools are not going to do well, they'll have lower scores, it makes us look like we're not doing our job.\"</p> <p>Even before Katrina, the quality of infrastructure in New Orleans was poor. Its roads, built on swampy ground and poorly maintained, are often bumpy and potholed. The officials behind its school reforms say one of their concerns is to deal with a gap the government can fix; the supply of skilled workers.</p> <p>Raising standards in schools means more jobs in sectors like oil and gas, a mainstay of the state's economy, can be filled by local people. Patrick Dobard, superintendent of the Recovery school district, said: \"As a state we have a number of chemical plants and what we're finding is that requirements in plant operators have changed dramatically over the last ten or 15 years, where you really need a couple of years of community college or two years of four-year college to perform at the level they need to have for workers, so there's a dire need in the industry to have higher performing workers.</p> <p>\"That's why we're trying to ensure we have strong technical education in our schools.\"</p> <p>The public school system in New Orleans remains skewed by race and income compared with the city it serves. In the academic year 2011-12, 90% of students in New Orleans public schools were African American and 85% were on free or reduced lunches, an indicator of poverty. The US census says 60% of the city population is black and 24% are classified as poor.</p> <h2>The US census says</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398427479\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/10/26/1351268827268/Clark-Prep-charter-school-008.jpg\" alt=\"Clark Prep charter school in New Orleans\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clark Prep: formerly a 'school of last resort'. Photograph: Julie Dermansky for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julie Dermansky/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p></p> <p>Meanwhile, those at the forefront of change are often white, prompting accusations that this is a reform imposed by outsiders. Since the charter school programme was accelerated in the wake of Katrina, the profile of school staff has changed; it has become whiter and younger. White, the state superintendent, acknowledges the change \u2013 around half of school leaders are now white, he says. He said: \"Its not far from the demographic of the city itself which has also changed. It's over a third white.\"</p> <p>The concentration of African American children in New Orleans schools dates back to desegregation; white flight created entirely black schools in the inner city, and largely white ones in the suburbs. Joseph S Clark prepatory school \u2013 better known as Clark Prep \u2013 was, before desegregation, a highly performing black school.</p> <p>But when it was taken over by charter operator FirstLine Schools, it had become a \"school of last resort,\" according to co-principal Alex Hochron.</p> <p>He said: \"The year before FirstLine took over in 2010, Clark was the lowest-performing high school in the whole of Louisiana. When we walked in here, spray-painted up one of the banisters was the word 'graveyard'. [We said] did someone do this because we're taking over the school? The response was: that's been up there for months.</p> <p>\"There was very little authority. There were fires being set in the bathrooms. I'm not saying the adults weren't working, but there wasn't a sense of consistency and support.\"</p> <p>The change in two years is evident to the students, who come up unprompted to tell outsiders of their pride in the school. One student, Henrietta London, said: \"This school used to be a mess; children were learning nothing. My mum sent me here because they're rebuilding the school and changing the culture.\"</p> <p>The school ran a poster campaign this year aimed at recruiting new parents. One poster showed faces from the class of 2012, highlighting how many had been accepted into college. Another featured a star student in his basketball gear, asking: \"What will be your legacy?\"</p> <p>Jay Altman, chief executive of FirstLine Schools, dismisses the idea that the competition for students discourages schools from sharing knowledge.</p> <p>\"Even though hospitals in this country are competing with each other and patients have relative choice, medicine has some of the best knowledge sharing in the world,\" he pointed out. \"Those of us who are trying to close the [education] achievement gap nationally, we share practices all the time.\"</p> <p>The future in Louisiana is one in which the competitive pressures will only get more intense. The state estimates that 380,000 schoolchildren, out of 700,000 statewide, are eligible for the voucher scheme. Charter schools, introduced in many other cities as competition to traditional public schools, are themselves facing the prospect of pupils being poached.</p> <p>The language of the marketplace pervades the conversation about schools here. When the architects of school reform in Louisiana speak about the public school system, it is reminiscent of a private equity firm casting a hawkish eye over a mediocre business they have just bought.</p> <p>White is uncompromising about the virtues of choice, even if that means weak schools being driven to the wall. \"I think competition is always to some degree destabilising to those who can't compete,\" he said. \"I have no problem with a school that is failing parents and kids being essentially destabilised because parents aren't choosing it.\"'</p>",
  "<p>The fallout from a claim by a<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2012/oct/26/john-sununu-colin-powell-obama\"> prominent Romney supporter</a> that former Bush secretary of state Colin Powell endorsed Barack Obama on racial grounds showed no sign of abating on Friday.</p> <p>John Sununu, who is the co-chair of Mitt Romney's campaign, said on Thursday that Powell endorsed the president because both men are black.</p> <p>He told CNN: \"When you take a look at Colin Powell, you have to wonder whether that's an endorsement based on issues or whether he's got a slightly different reason for preferring President Obama\".</p> <p>Sununu, a former governor of New Hampshire, added: \"I think when you have somebody of your own race that you're proud of being president of the United States. I applaud Colin for standing with him\".</p> <p>Sununu later issued a statement attempting to distance himself from the remarks, but Democratic mayor of Newark, Cory Booker, said Sununu's comments were \"disrespectful\" in an interview on CNN.</p> <p>\"Whatever he meant or not, it was a statement that is unfortunate and just reflects a lack of understanding and sensitivity,\" Booker said. \"He's gotten himself in a jam, and he's going to wear that jam for a while.\"</p> <p>Booker said Sununu's claims were \"unfortunate, and we should talk about those issues and presumptions that still often exist\" but added that in \"these last days, let's focus on the candidates themselves, what their plans and platforms are\".</p> <p>The row comes as the Romney campaign is still under pressure to distance itself from Richard Mourdock, the Senate candidate who is personally endorsed by Mitt Romney but has been the subject of intense criticism after claiming that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/25/republican-richard-mourdock-rape-remark\">pregnancies from rape are \"something that God intended to happen\"</a>.</p> <p>In his statement on Thursday, Sununu did not apologise for his remarks, although he appeared to <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/politico44/2012/10/sununu-powells-endorsement-of-obama-racedriven-147310.html?hp=\" f3\"\">row back somewhat</a>.</p> <p>\"Colin Powell is a friend and I respect the endorsement decision he made and I do not doubt that it was based on anything but his support of the president's policies. Piers Morgan's question was whether Colin Powell should leave the party, and I don't think he should,\" Sununu said.</p> <p>Colin Powell endorsed Obama in 2008 and <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505263_162-57539893/colin-powell-endorses-barack-obama-for-president/\">announced his support</a> for a second term on Thursday, praising the president's handling of the economy.</p> <p>\"I think, generally, we've come out of the dive and we're starting to gain altitude,\" Powell told CBS This Morning, adding that \"housing is now starting to pick up\" and \"consumer confidence is rising\".</p> <p>The former secretary of state also criticised Romney's malleable positions on foreign policy. \"The governor who was speaking on Monday night at the debate was saying things that were quite different from what he said earlier,\" Powell said. \"I'm not quite sure which Governor Romney we would be getting with respect to foreign policy.\"</p> <p>It is not the first time Sununu has been criticised for comments about Obama. After the first presidential debate in Denver, Sununu described Obama as \"lazy\" on MSNBC, <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/tv/andrea-mitchell-visibly-shocked-after-sununu-calls-obama-lazy-asks-him-if-he-would-take-it-back/\">leaving host Andrea Mitchell visibly shocked</a>.</p> <p>\"What people saw last night, I think, was a president who revealed his incompetence \u2013 how lazy and detached he is and how he has absolutely no idea how serious the economy problems of the country are and how he has failed to even address them,\" Sununu said. </p> <p>In July <a href=\"http://www.gotchamediablog.com/2012/07/fox-news-john-sununu-says-obama-was-in.html\">he told Fox News </a> that Obama has \"no idea how the American system functions\".</p> <p>Sununu added: \"And we shouldn't be surprised about that, because he spent his early years in Hawaii smoking something, spent the next set of years in Indonesia, another set of years in Indonesia, and frankly, when he came to the US, he worked as a community organizer, which is a socialized structure.\"</p>",
  "<p>So many stories of employers pressuring their workers to vote for Romney have come out that you might think workplace intimidation was invented just for this election.</p> <p>Romney certainly hasn't done much to dispel this perception. In a conference call to the National Federation of Independent Business, the GOP candidate was <a href=\"http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2012/10/romney-told-employers-tell-employees-whom-vote/58076/\">recorded encouraging business owners</a> to:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[M]ake it very clear to your employees what you believe is in the best interest of your enterprise and therefore their job and their future in the upcoming elections.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>A number of Romney backers took it upon themselves to spell out more clearly to their workers what \"the best interest for their job\" really means. David Siegel, CEO of Florida's Westgate Resorts, <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5950189/the-ceo-who-built-himself-americas-largest-house-just-threatened-to-fire-his-employees-if-obamas-elected\">emailed</a> his employees that a second term for Obama would likely give him \"no choice but to reduce the size of this company\". Republican donor-activists Charles and David Koch were no less subtle when they sent 45,000 employees of their Georgia Pacific paper company a list of whom to vote for, warning that workers \"<a href=\"http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/14017/koch_industries_sends_45000_employees_pro_romney_mailing\">may suffer the consequences</a>\" if Obama is re-elected.</p> <p>Florida-based ASG Software CEO Arthur Allen informed his employees that he was contemplating a merger that would eliminate \"<a href=\"http://tv.msnbc.com/2012/10/14/exclusive-ceo-suggests-employees-jobs-may-be-at-stake-if-romney-doesnt-win/\">60% of the salaries</a>\" of the company \u2013 should Romney lose. In Ohio, coal mine owner Robert Murray <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/108140/coal-miners-donor-mitt-romney-benefactor\">left employees in no doubt that they were expected to attend a Romney rally</a> \u2013 off the clock and without pay. In Cuba, at least they pay workers for show demonstrations.</p> <p>Democrats are apoplectic. But as Romney assured those who have the power to hire and fire thousands of people, there is \"nothing illegal about you talking to your employees about what you believe is best for the business\". He's right. Heavy-handed? Yes. An abuse of authority? Probably. Against the law? Not likely.</p> <p>News outlets, on the other hand, are merely confused.</p> <p>\"Can your boss really tell you who to vote for?\" <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/10/can-your-boss-threaten-to-fire-you-if-you-dont-vote-for-romney/263709/\">asked</a> the Atlantic incredulously, before concluding the answer is \"probably yes\". Should this be a surprise? Seeing that your boss can legally tell you to do nearly anything else, down to what you may wear, when you may eat and how often you may go to the bathroom (and, if he wishes, demand samples when you do), the question comes across as a little na\u00efve. So, too, is the <a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/topics/elections/campaign-trail/you-can-get-fired-talking-politics-work\">corollary</a> \"Can you be fired for expressing political views at work?\" Again, the answer is probably yes, which should only be a shock to anyone who has never held a job in an American private-sector workplace.</p> <p>In truth, as an \"at-will\" (that is, non-union) employee, you can be fired for much less. In Arizona, you can be fired for <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/ariz-birth-control-bill-lets-employers-fire-women-pill-based-religious-views-425530\">using birth control</a>. If you live in any one of 29 states, you can be fired for <a href=\"http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/press/5-people-who-were-fired-for-being-gay-and-the-29-states-where-that-is-still-legal/\">being gay</a>. You can be fired for <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/expresident/really-weird-reasons-for-getting-fired\">being a fan of the Green Bay Packers</a> if your boss roots for the Bears.</p> <p>Lest you think employer authority ends when you clock out, only four states \u2013 California, Colorado, New York and North Dakota \u2013 protect workers from being fired for legal activity <em>outside of work</em>. For the rest, workers can and <a href=\"http://crookedtimber.org/2012/07/01/let-it-bleed-libertarianism-and-the-workplace/\">have been fired for anything</a> from smoking to cross-dressing, all in the privacy of their homes. The growing practice of employers demanding job applicants to <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2122404/House-kills-plan-block-employers-demanding-Facebook-passwords-job-applicants.html\">hand over their Facebook passwords</a> underscores the blurring of the work-life divide in this information age.</p> <p>But free speech and voting rights are supposed to be more sacrosanct than the integrity of your Facebook account, so one would expect there to be greater political safeguards at work than there actually are. This is not to say they don't exist. Federal law makes it illegal to \"intimidate, threaten or coerce\" anyone against voting as they wish. But as Siegel, Allen and the Koch brothers have shown, the distinction between possible coercion or intimidation and \"worker education\" is rather fuzzy in the eyes of the law.</p> <p>Rather, the federal government largely punted questions of employee free speech to states, a legacy of federalism that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws\">hasn't had the best track record</a> when it comes to voting rights. In a state-by-state breakdown, UCLA law professor <a href=\"http://www.trolp.org/main_pgs/issues/v16n2/Volokh.pdf\">Eugene Volokh</a> finds such laws vary widely. About half of Americans live in states that provide some worker protection for political speech or from pressure to vote a certain way, such as threat of job loss. Florida is not one of them. Ohio bars employers from forcing workers to sign a petition, but not from <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/08/ohio-miners-required-attend-romney-rally\">standing in front of cameras</a> next to a \"Coal Country Stands With Mitt\" banner.</p> <p>Of course, what's on the books is one matter; enforcement is another. Even if you are lucky enough to live in New Mexico and have a signed letter saying you were fired for your Obama tote bag, it typically takes litigation to get your job back. And many people don't have the time or money to go through a court battle, even if the law is on their side.</p> <p>If anything is happening on the legal end, things are getting worse. The 2010 US supreme court Citizens United case greatly expanded the parameters of what is considered \"employer free speech\". Most famously, the decision lifted restrictions on corporate campaign spending and gave rise to Super Pacs. But the broader implications are unclear. If Citizens United gives companies free rein to mobilize their resources politically as they wish, one former FEC official <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/issues/58_32/Workplace-Intimidation-Becomes-Murky-Post-Citizens-United-Era-218456-1.html\">suggests</a> that employees could be considered resources which companies may mobilize.</p> <p>This is why the recent political turn of employee intimidation isn't an anomaly. It's an election year manifestation \u2013 aided by the supreme court \u2013 of fundamental power imbalances that exist in most workplaces. Brooklyn College political scientist Corey Robin sees a historical pattern: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"During the McCarthy years, the state outsourced the most significant forms of coercion and repression to the workplace. Fewer than 200 people went to jail for their political beliefs, but two out of every five American workers was investigated or subject to surveillance. </p> <p>\"Today, we're seeing a similar process of outsourcing. Government can't tell you how to vote, but it allows CEOs to do so.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Robin concluded:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When workers are forced to go to rallies in communist countries, we call that Stalinism. Here, we call it the free market.</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>More middle-class voters regard themselves as leftwing than do working-class voters, and working-class people show less support for overseas aid and immigration than middle-class voters, according to a new YouGov poll, commissioned by Progress, the Labour pressure group.</p> <p>The findings arguably underline the complex challenge Ed Miliband faces in reconnecting with people who were once described as Labour's core supporters.</p> <p>Peter Kellner, the YouGov president, said: \"While middle-class voters divide evenly on immigration, working-class voters divide more than two-to-one in favour of stopping all immigration.</p> <p>\"Likewise with overseas aid: middle-class voters divide evenly on whether to end it altogether, while working-class voters back the idea by two-to-one.\"</p> <p>On welfare reform, the picture is more nuanced. Overall, middle-class voters show 53% to 38% in favour of reducing welfare benefits for the unemployed, but working-class voters came out 45% to 40% against the idea.</p> <p>However, skilled workers, as opposed to those with unskilled jobs or relying on state benefits (DEs), are as keen on reducing benefits as the ABs and C1s; it is the DEs who come out against the idea. This policy is also supported in every region except the north of England and Scotland.</p> <p>Kellner concludes: \"Opposition to lower benefits is greatest among those who most fear losing out, or are currently relying on state benefits \u2013 scant sign there of working-class solidarity.\"</p> <p>The polling, based on aggregate data compiled in the summer and autumn, shows proportionately more middle-class people (36%) describe themselves as leftwing than working-class (28%).</p> <p>Far more DE voters disown any political affiliation.</p> <p>The results lead Kellner to conclude that although working-class voters are still more likely to vote Labour than Conservative, this has more to do with tribe and tradition, than ideology or policy.</p> <p>He is more broadly a strong advocate of the view that Labour will win from the centre.</p> <p>The polling also shows working-class voters regard stopping immigration as the single most important of seven policies put to them.</p> <p>Among C2 and DE voters a ban on all immigration is supported by 67% to 26%. Among middle-class voters (ABC1 voters) support is evenly divided with 49% to 46% opposed. On ending all overseas aid, the proposition is supported by C2 and DE voters by 58% to 31% and opposed by AB voters by 48% to 47%. On reducing welfare benefits to the unemployed ABs support the measure by 53% to 38% and C2s by a similar margin of 52 to 33%. Only DEs oppose the measure by a considerable 56 to 29%.</p> <p>Across the classes there is uniform opposition to income tax increases to protect public services. There is also general opposition to spending cuts.</p> <p>There is little class difference in overall support shown for gay marriage, nationalising the rail companies or putting workers on company boards.</p> <p>Progress director Robert Philpott said: \"These results show the need for Labour to avoid sectional appeals targeted at specific classes. As it did in the runup to 1997 election, the party needs to develop policies and a message that can appeal across a broad cross-class coalition. Ed Miliband's notion of one nation Labour offers the opportunity to do just that.\"</p>",

Campaign groups believe the extreme weather of 2011 and 2012 \u2013 with hurricanes, heat waves, floods, droughts , wildfires in the US and the epic melting in the Arctic \u2013 are behind a sharp rise in the number of Americans who believe in global warming over the last two years.</p> <p>Some 70% of Americans believe in climate change, according to a <a href=\"http://environment.yale.edu/climate/files/Climate-Beliefs-September-2012.pdf\">Yale survey last month</a>, up 13% from 2010.</p> <p>As Sandy barrels in, climate messaging firms and campaign groups are putting out primers on the connections between climate change and extreme weather, and the rising costs over the last few years of dealing with monster storms.</p> <p>The challenge of course is whether either Obama or Romney will care to make that link on the campaign trail.</p> </blockquote>  <p>The question, Suzanne writes, is how much climate change might be to blame for storms like Sandy:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Climate change certainly makes strong storms even stronger. There is ample evidence that global warming is responsible for the increasing intensity of Atlantic hurricanes and a longer hurricane season \u2013 but no single storm can be attributed to global warming.</p> <p>Five of the top north Atlantic hurricanes ever recorded occurred in the last eight years, including Katrina, Rita, and Ivan.</p> <p>Hurricanes are now producing greater storm surges, heavier rain and more flooding than in the past as evidenced by Irene last year, which caused widespread flooding in the north-east, and Debby last June, which produced up to 2ft of rain in some locations in Florida.</p> <p>\u201cClimate change has led to warmer oceans and a warmer environment and more moisture for these storms which makes them more intense than they otherwise would be,\u201d said Kevin Trenberth, senior scientist at the National Centre for Atmospheric Research in Colorado.</p> <p>The warmer atmosphere and sea surface temperatures provide extra fuel for those storms. That extra boost, combined with heavy and prolonged rain, stronger storm surges and coastal erosion in places, mean severe storms can pack a punch even relatively far inland. \u201cWhat it really does is that it gives rise to a greater risk of flooding,\u201d Trenberth said.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-26T19:42:19.579Z\">at 8.42pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-508ade8bb5793e5495b45138\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-26T19:03:40.106Z\">8.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Mayor Michael Bloomberg</strong> has just held a news conference about how New York City is preparing for Sandy. </p>  <p>Bloomberg said Sandy is expected sometime Monday.

Sandy is currently just north of Grand Abaco Island in the Bahamas off the coast of Florida. The storm is moving slowly, about 6mph.

  "<p>Parliaments can be boisterous places and elections are often heated affairs. But the frosty exchanges of an Obama-Romney debate or prime minister's question time in Westminster pale in comparison to the rough and tumble of Ukrainian political discourse.</p> <p>With the country poised for elections on Sunday for seats in a parliament renowned for violence and vulgarity, the tone has fallen still further. This is a place where parliamentarians do not refer to each other as honourable friends. They are more likely to threaten to kill each other.</p> <p>In recent weeks:</p> <p>\u2022 President Viktor Yanukovych blasted the economy minister, Petro Poroshenko, at a public meeting by promising to \"rip off\" his head after they disagreed on tax policy.</p> <p>\u2022 The mayor of Kharkiv, Dmytro Kernes, told a subordinate at an official meeting: \"I'll multiply you to zero.\"</p> <p>\u2022 The mayor of Kerch, Oleh Osadchyi, called journalists who criticised a new monument \"morons\" and \"bastards\".</p> <p>Observers say the bad political manners partly derive from Soviet times, when communication between bosses and their staff was often marked by humiliation and the use of swearwords. \"It was a joke that <em>mat</em> [bad language, in Ukrainian or Russian] was a main tool of Soviet management,\" the political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko said.</p> <p>The legacy of the 1990s, when the transformation to capitalism \u2013 following the collapse of the Soviet system \u2013 was marked by rampant criminality, is also a contributing factor.</p> <p>Most representatives of the current establishment were brought up during those rough times. \"A generation of the 1990s that survived the criminal showdowns came into politics,\" said Taras Berezovets, a political analyst. \"And they brought into politics their customs, slang and culture of communication.\"</p> <p>Yanukovych was twice imprisoned as a young adult, and has been known to use street language while the prime minister, Mykola Azarov, once told opposition MPs to \"piss off\" after they criticised his budget plan when he was finance minister.</p> <p>Sometimes politicians go beyond verbal abuse, especially in parliament, where fights have often led to torn shirts and bleeding heads, and where eggs, chairs and even smoke bombs have been used as weapons. Pictures of the parliamentary fights have been beamed around the world.</p> <p>Pundits blame the brutality on the internecine warring between the country's political elites, which led to the opposition bloc leader and former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko being jailed for seven years.</p> <p>Political talkshows are another venue for abuse. \"You talk about the courts that jailed Tymoshenko and why she is in jail. And you, a black-mouthed witch, were running around those courts,\" Oleh Liashko, a former Tymoshenko bloc deputy, told Inna Bohoslovska of the pro-government Party of Regions during a popular talkshow. \"Should I hit him in the face?\" Bohoslovska asked the studio audience.</p> <p>Some experts admit such an exchange could boost the pair's popularity, as both are running for parliament. \"This way, politicians try to seem closer to the people; they are flirting with the electorate speaking this kind of language,\" said Oleh Pokalchuk, a social psychologist.</p> <p>Up to 40% of Ukrainians consider brutality and obscene language acceptable, according to a poll by the Gorshenin Institute thinktank.</p> <h2>Kangaroo court<br></h2> <p>Sprawling over 140 hectares on the banks of the Dnieper river, Mezhyhirya \u2013 \"the land among hills\" \u2013 is a paradise fit for a king. And a president. The few who have ventured behind the five-metre-high fence topped with barbed wire describe a magnificent park, guesthouse, aviary with ostriches, and dozens of security guards.</p> <p>That Viktor Yanukovych lives here is not in dispute. But a controversy has erupted over who owns the property and whether it is fitting for a president of a struggling state to live in such luxury.</p> <p>More details emerged about the secretive world of Mezhyhirya when a journalist, Tetiana Chornovil, managed to get into the grounds in August and spent three hours walking around, taking photographs on her mobile phone. Chornovil released pictures of a 50-metre pontoon, which people called \"a palace on the water\". She later told colleagues: \"It looks awesome: gilded wood, even the masts were gilded.\" Chornovil is now running for parliament as an opposition candidate.</p> <p>Mezhyhirya is the former summer house of Soviet-era Communist party chiefs. Yanukovych chose it as a residence after he became president in 2010. He says he only owns a tiny part of it, but Sergiy Leshchenko, a prominent investigative journalist at the web newspaper Ukrainska Pravda, claims Yanukovych owns the entire estate, describing a complex ownership structure via a network of international holding companies that ultimately comes back to a firm called Tantalit, run by a lawyer close to the Yanukovych family, Pavlo Lytovchenko.</p> <p>Leshchenko said the estimated price of the house together with a nearby sports complex and sauna is around 1bn hryvnia (\u00a380.5m). \"This excludes the price of golf club, horse club, yacht club, heliport, zoos, greenhouses, garages and the administrative buildings,\" he said. In addition, the residence is served by hundreds of people.</p> <p>The president's affection for exotic animals has generated its fair share of jokes. Leshchenko said that apart from horses, ostriches and deer, three kangaroos were brought to the residence. But one of them died, another escaped and the third was released with hopes it would return with the escaped kangaroo, but it also disappeared in the nearby forest.</p>",
  "<p>US economic growth rose in the third quarter to reach an annualized rate of 2%, higher than expected and fueled by rising consumer confidence, the fledgling recovery in the housing market and an increase in government spending.</p> <p>The latest figures from the commerce department are the last before November's election and come as US economic recovery \u2013 or the lack of it \u2013 has dominated the 2012 election cycle.</p> <p>The third-quarter GDP figures contain good and bad news for Barack Obama as he fights to defend his economic record against challenger Mitt Romney.</p> <p>In a blog post Alan Krueger, chairman of Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, wrote: \"While we have more work to do, together with other economic indicators, this report provides further evidence that the economy is moving in the right direction.\"</p> <p>Romney called the rise \"discouraging\". \"Slow economic growth means slow job growth and declining take-home pay. This is what four years of president Obama's policies have produced. Americans are ready for change \u2014 for growth, for jobs, for higher take-home pay,\" he said in a statement.</p> <p>The rise was higher than the 1.8% economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected. The economy has now grown for 13 consecutive quarters. But at 2% growth remains extremely weak and the latest report contained worrying signs that business is cutting back, fearing a worsening of economic conditions.</p> <p>Consumer spending accounted for most of the rise in GDP. Personal consumption expenditures rose 2% in the quarter, up from 1.5% in the previous quarter. Purchases of long-lasting goods soared 8.5%. The news came as the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan consumer confidence index rose to its highest level since September 2007.</p> <p>But while consumers are spending again, business confidence seems to be weakening. Non-residential fixed investment, which includes business spending on structures and equipment, fell 1.3% during the third quarter, compared with a 3.6% gain in the prior period. The pullback suggests businesses are reigning in spending ahead of the election and the uncertainty over the so-called \"fiscal cliff\" \u2013 the expiration of Bush-era tax cuts and imposition of massive spending cuts scheduled for the end of the year unless political compromise is found.</p> <p>Paul Dales, a senior US economist at Capital Economics, said it was clear that the fiscal cliff was proving a drag on business investment. Capital Economics calculates that Europe's economic woes have knocked another 0.5% off US GDP.</p> <p>\"Things aren't too bad in the US. Growth remains weak but it is still growth,\" he said.</p> <p>But he said there were worrying signs ahead, and that consumers could become less confident if the fiscal cliff debate is not addressed soon.</p> <p>\"Personally I don't think we will go off the fiscal cliff, but I also imagine a deal will not be done until the last minute, which could prove very worrying to consumers,\" Dales said.</p> <p>The GDP figures come a week before next Friday's nonfarm payroll jobs number \u2013 the last before polling day. The nonfarm payroll figures have become a monthly flashpoint in the election. Last month, jobs growth rose 114,000, higher than expected, the figures remain weak but the move was enough to send the unemployment rate down to a three-and-a-half-year low of 7.8%.</p>",

Romney and Republican National Committee operatives won\u2019t say it publicly but concede privately that Nevada is out of reach \u2014 largely because of Hispanic voters and Obama\u2019s superior ground operations.

  "<p>Margaret Sullivan, the New York Times' fifth public editor, <a href=\"http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/23/times-must-aggressively-cover-mark-thompsons-role-in-bbcs-troubles/\">this week asked publicly whether company's incoming CEO</a> \u2013 former BBC Director General Mark Thompson \u2013 was fit for the job. This was a fair question \u2013 the answer to which is unclear, despite publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr's continued backing of Thompson.</p> <p>It was also the declaration of independence that anyone in her job must make, sooner rather than later. Sullivan has been in post a mere matter of weeks, so her stance on this issue has turned heads and drawn praise.</p> <p>The Times' public editor \u2013 a role more typically called \"ombudsman\" in other news organizations \u2013 has an almost impossible task. Not only are the publication's pages (print and online) under hyper-intense scrutiny, but so are the public editor's views. On the very early evidence so far, though, Sullivan has earned strong marks.</p> <p>First, a relevant disclosure: I was one of more than a dozen people whom the New York Times asked to apply for the job recently. And, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jul/02/manifesto-newspaper-public-editor-social-media-era\">as I wrote in July</a>, my approach would have been radically different to anything the Times had done before \u2013 and substantially different to Sullivan's objectives, also. Most notably, my plan was to lower the personal profile of the public editor and commensurately raise the profile of the public: namely, the paper's audience.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398431475\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/26/1351262447654/margaretsullivan_220.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Sullivan, New York Times public editor\" width=\"220\" height=\"273\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margaret Sullivan. Photograph: New York Times</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That said, given the goals Sullivan has set out for herself, she's making the kinds of waves any ombudsman should make. I don't agree with everything she's written, and I'm sometimes baffled by her choice of topics. But she's expanding the mission in smart ways, and you almost always know where she stands.</p> <p>In the past, most of the public editor's voice could be found in a bi-weekly column in the Sunday commentary section, with occasional postings to the public editor's blog. Sullivan has immediately reversed that emphasis. The public editor's column in the print edition remains, but it's not where Sullivan does her best work.</p> <p>That clearly resides now in her blog, called the <a href=\"http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/\">Public Editor's Journal</a> where vitally reactive pieces like the Mark Thompson issue can flower in much more timely ways, and where she can bring the readers more directly into the process, which I applaud.</p> <p>Early in her tenure, <a href=\"http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/13/both-versions-of-romney-critique-should-have-remained-on-web/\">Sullivan took Times editors to task</a> for their handling of a story about Mitt Romney's reaction to the attacks on a US consulate in Libya, where the American ambassador and three other Americans were killed. The Times did a major rewrite of a story it had put on its website, removing several quotes from Romney advisors and fundamentally changing the tone of the piece. In a polite but tough piece within hours of the second story's publication, Sullivan said these were effectively different stories and that both should have been preserved on the website.</p> <p>Along with many, I was very glad to see <a href=\"http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/17/the-times-needs-a-policy-on-quotation-approval-and-soon/\">Sullivan criticize the newspaper's willingness to let sources vet quotes</a> before publication \u2013 and even happier when the Times updated its policy to forbid this. Of course, the Times also has a policy about the unnecessary use of anonymous sources that it routinely violates, so we'll see if the quotes policy means anything in real life.</p> <p>I hope Sullivan will find the rampant use of anonymous sources to be as odious as her predecessors have. It would be a major feather in her cap if she can succeed where previous public editors have failed and shame the organization into realizing how this practice harms its credibility.</p> <p>Intriguingly, Sullivan has ventured into matters that have little to do with Times journalism, at least directly. The most notable, and welcome, example of this came late last month <a href=\"http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/27/readers-have-a-stake-in-president-obamas-free-speech-disconnect/\">when she noted President Obama's \"disconnect between words and actions on free speech\"</a> given his administration's flagrant attacks on journalism by its prosecution of whistleblowers, as well as its penchant for secrecy and other acts that mock the first amendment.</p> <p>Arguably, Sullivan's chief misstep to date came in a <a href=\"http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/10/a-twitter-outburst-and-another-chance-for-andrew-goldman/\">blogpost about a freelancer, Andrew Goldman</a>, who was reprimanded by his editor for Twitter comments about the actor Tippi Hedren whom he interviewed for a regular slot in the Times' weekend magazine. Goldman had responded rashly and rudely to Twitter criticism that he'd effectively asked Hedren if she'd \"slept her way to the top\". </p> <p>\"Can you believe we're talking about this in 2012?\" asked Sullivan, indignantly siding with Goldman's critics. In retrospect, Sullivan told me, it would have been a good idea to speak with him <em>before</em> her original post; she added that he declined two opportunities immediately afterward to comment, on the record, in the blog.</p> <p>Sullivan has firmly ensconced herself at the heart of the Times, in the newsroom, and she frequently quotes the editorial staff. But she will have to work to keep her independence and crisp judgments: journalists are among the most thin-skinned and opaque people on the planet, happy to dish out criticism and ask tough questions but often furious and stonewall-prone when anyone casts any doubt on their own efforts. If the public editor is truly to represent the public, she will sometimes have to question the paper's editorial staff in confrontational ways.</p> <p>Will Sullivan one day wish she'd operated from a different physical location?

You want to do it with a great guy,\" Dunham begins. It sounds like she's talking about one thing, but it soon becomes clear she's talking about another thing, a comedic technique as pathbreaking as we've come to expect from the 26-year-old writer and director of HBO's Girls.</p> <p>\"It should be with \u2026 someone who really cares about women. Who cares about whether you get health insurance, and specifically whether you get birth control. The consequences are huge. You want to do it with a guy who brought the troops out of Iraq\u2026 My first time voting was amazing. Before, I was a girl. Now I was a woman.\"</p> <p>Clearly, Democrats hope to motivate college-age first-time voters, but it's hard not to wonder if they also just wanted to enjoy the predictable spectacle of the furious response from people whose fury can only fuel Obama's support.</p> <p>The ad, various rightwing outlets agreed, was <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/10/25/HBO-star-ad-Obama-voting-first-time-sex\">\"astoundingly tasteless\"</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/331694/lena-dunhams-awkward-ad-nathaniel-botwinick\">\"cringeworthy\"</a>, <a href=\"http://www.redstate.com/2012/10/25/your-first-time/\">\"cheap\"</a> and <a href=\"http://www.therightscoop.com/disqusting-new-obama-ad-asks-who-would-you-rather-do-it-with-obama-or-romney/\">\"disgusting\"</a>; it showed, the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/morning-bits/2012/10/26/fb30a56a-1f16-11e2-9cd5-b55c38388962_blog.html\">Washington Post's Jennifer Rubin added</a>, that Obama was willing to \"debase the presidency\". \"Obama has young daughters,\" <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/10/25/HBO-star-ad-Obama-voting-first-time-sex\">wrote Ben Shapiro</a> on Breitbart.com, \"but that didn't stop him from releasing this commercial. Because this is what Obama thinks of your daughters.\"</p> <p>But wait: this ad, plainly, is aimed at women in their early twenties, who don't have voting-age daughters. Who mentioned daughters?</p> <p>Oh, it was John Nolte, Breitbart's editor-at-large, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NolteNC/status/261610193899630592\">who demanded on Twitter</a>: \"How could a president with two young, blossoming daughters\u2026\" Actually, on second thoughts, let's leave that disturbingly creepy observation right there.</p> <p>\u2022 What dark secrets, one wonders, might be exposed by the publication of a new \"angry tell-all\" memoir, written by a disaffected former aide of Joe Biden's? That he harbours a burning hatred of trains? That he's never set foot in Scranton, Pennsylvania? That his mother did not, in fact, sit him down at their kitchen table and say \"Joey, now listen to me,\" followed by a folsky version of whatever message the Obama campaign happens to be emphasising on any given day?</p> <p>None of the above, sadly. The Payoff, by a former Senate staffer named Jeff Connaughton, paints the vice-president as an \"egomaniacal autocrat\" who sometimes swears angrily at his assistants, all of which suggests, troublingly enough, that Biden may be a politician. The juiciest detail concerns Biden's clunky observation, on the 2008 campaign trail, that Obama would \"be tested\" early in his term by foreign enemies. \"Biden told us that Obama had called him and told him sharply that he didn't need public tutoring,\" Connaughton reports, quoting the president as telling his deputy: \"I don't need you acting like you're my Henry Higgins.\"</p> <p>Biden's response, the way his Connaughton tells it, was this splendidly Bidenesque observation: \"I'm going to have to earn his trust, but I'm not going to grovel to this guy. My manhood is not negotiable.\" Perhaps this helps clarify Obama's reference to Biden, in the final debate, as \"my current vice-president\"? Enough snippiness, guys! When I was a kid, growing up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, we'd have settled this with a simple old-fashioned knife fight.</p> <p>\u2022 In a game-changing development, the singer Meat Loaf has made his first ever political endorsement, backing Mitt Romney for president because of\u2026 well, because of storms. </p> <p>\"There has storm clouds come over the United States,\" Loaf -- that's his surname, right? -- told an Ohio rally, as quoted with mean-spirited precision by the Los Angeles Times. A terrifying storm is indeed headed America's way in the coming days, in the shape of Hurricane Sandy, but Loaf was speaking in metaphors. \"There is thunderstorms over Europe,\" he went on. </p> <p>\"There are hailstorms, and I mean major hailstorms, in the Middle East. There are storms brewing through China, through Asia, through everywhere.\" </p> <p>And Romney, he explained, was the man to quell those storms. Meat Loaf ought then to have presented the Republican with a special Romneyfied version of his most famous album, entitled Bat Out Of Heck, but did not.</p>",
  "<p>The voice was strong and passionate. The \"fired up\" catchphrase was familiar. The two-thousand strong Florida crowd of Democrats was adoring as they were urged to get to the polls.</p> <p>But the Obama on the stage was not Barack. It was Michelle. In a fiery piece of oratory given in a sports hall at Broward College in Davie, Florida, the first lady was a natural campaigner getting the full rock star treatment every bit as much as her spouse does.</p> <p>\"Yeahhhh!\" she said as she took to the podium. \"This is what I call a rally!\" She looked out at the roaring crowd. \"I can tell you all seem pretty fired up and ready to go. And that's a good thing because I am really fired up and ready to go myself,\" she said.</p> <p>But Michelle Obama does not have the field to herself when it comes to the fierce and increasingly tight election battle of 2012. Ann Romney, wife of Republican challenger Mitt, has also emerged as a powerful advocate for her husband. She, too, is criss-crossing the battleground states, enthusiastically rallying Republican foot soldiers for her spouse's cause.</p> <p>Both candidates' wives have the same role: energise the base and humanise their husbands with warm tales of character and family life. But now, as the neck-and-neck election draws to a close, each is also seen as a vital advocate for what is emerging as the most important demographic in the contest: women voters.</p> <p>A new poll, published on Thursday, showed that Obama's long-held lead among women voters had all but vanished as Romney's campaign has enjoyed a remarkable national surge and brought the overall race to a virtual dead heat. After months of leading by double digits among female voters, the AP-GfK survey showed the candidates now tied at 47% among women. Just a month ago Obama's lead had been a huge 16 points. \"Often the Democrats have taken the female vote for granted. But this is four years into an economic crisis and the Republicans have hoped to siphon off some of that female support on economic issues,\" said Katherine Jellison, an expert on women's history at Ohio University.</p> <p>Michelle Obama and Ann Romney are now a key part of each campaign's fight for women voters. But they are making their pitches to wildly different audiences and in significantly different ways. They are also very different people. One is a black ex-lawyer who once earned far more than her husband. The other is a blonde housewife, devout Mormon and mother of five boys. Mirroring their husbands' polarised campaigns, the efforts of Ann Romney and Michelle Obama are also studies of opposites even as they share the goal of winning the White House. </p> <p>At Broward, Michelle Obama hammered away at a mixed-race crowd gathered at a community college in a lower-middle class neighbourhood of small homes and strip malls lined with fast food joints. She gave an impassioned speech for about 45 minutes, heavy on her husband's policy achievements from the past four years. She came across as a natural speaker, mixing in anecdotes of family life with a stern lecture on the importance of volunteering for the campaign. \"I don't care what's going on, sign up to do something before election day,\" she insisted.</p> <p>Meanwhile, near Orlando, Florida, Ann Romney made her own pitch this week. She spoke outdoors in a bucolic city park in Winter Park, one of the wealthiest communities in Florida. Just off a street lined with expensive restaurants and fashionable boutiques she spoke to an overwhelmingly white crowd of locals. She emerged on stage clutching the hands of two young boys. \"I have brought some special friends with me,\" she gushed. \"These are two of my 18 grandchildren.\" Her speech, with a heavy emphasis on Romney family stories, was largely policy free and lasted just 15 minutes. But her image was flawless: that of a proud churchgoing mother and wife concerned for the future of America. At one stage she talked in folksy tones of her spouse's decision to run for president. She said she had asked her husband if it was \"too late\" to save America. \"Mitt said: \"It's growing late. It's getting very late. But it's not too late yet.\" I said: \"That's all I need to know. Go save America!\",\" she explained.</p> <p>Despite \u2013 or in fact because of \u2013 their hugely different styles, both candidates' wives are popular with their party's grassroots. \"I feel like I won a million dollars. She's very boisterous. She is active. When she speaks it's more heartfelt,\" said Shanovia Brown, 33, a corrections officer at Michelle Obama's Broward rally.</p> <p>But in Winter Park, Ann Romney was hitting the spot, too. \"She is very elegant, very classy. She will be a beautiful representative of America,\" said Beth Young, a 54-year-old flight attendant. Indeed, both Michelle Obama and Ann Romney are more popular than their husbands. In one recent poll, Michelle Obama's favourability rate was 69%, with Ann Romney at 52% - a jump of 12 points since April as her public profile has grown.</p> <p>So far Michelle Obama has been the more active spouse. She has been a fundraising powerhouse, bringing in more than $17m since the start of the year. At one event having a photo taken with the first lady cost $5,000. Michelle Obama has also been on edgy late-night talk shows, like Jimmy Kimmel, and appeared at Hollywood fundraisers with stars like Will Smith. \"With Michelle, Barack Obama can double the territory and double the number of donors reached,\" said Robert Watson, a professor of American studies at Lynn University.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Ann Romney has been a little more reticent. She frequently appears alongside her husband on television, but less so by herself. Some experts believe that is a mistake. \"She is not as naturally comfortable as Michelle. She has been under utilised,\" Watson said.</p> <p>But being a first lady, or a would-be first lady, is an entry into a strange and tradition-bound corner of American politics. It is essentially a subordinate role whose main aim is to tell a husband's story. Michelle Obama, once a distinguished lawyer, calls herself a \"mom-in-chief\" and does not shy away from schmaltz. It is seen as \"humanising\" Obama, who is often viewed as aloof. \"Although my husband is handsome and charming and incredibly smart \u2013 yes indeed \u2013 that is not why I married him. Listen closely. What truly made me fall in love with Barack Obama is something you all see every day \u2013 it's his character. It's his decency and his honesty,\" she said in Broward.</p> <p>Ann Romney, too, lays it on thick. In Winter Park she spoke of how her husband tended to a dying boy in hospital, visiting him regularly, telling him about heaven and helping him with his final wishes. She spoke of pride of her husband's performance in the television debates. \"To have Mitt Romney defining who he is and what kind of a person he is, I loved it,\" she said.</p> <p>Telling these homely stories is seen as vital by campaign strategists, not for the spouse's own image, but for their husbands'. \"We don't elect first ladies. Instead we think: this is the kind of spouse that he has chosen to marry and so her world view must line up with his,\" said Jellison. \"Religious conservatives will hear Ann Romney's message and feel comfortable that she is a traditionally-minded woman and that her husband will champion that mindset.\"</p> <p>Yet in the end their campaigning reduces both Michelle Obama and Ann Rommey to playing a subservient, traditionally \"female\" role in the election. Both tout their domestic credentials and experiences of motherhood. They talk about favoured recipes, their fashion choices are endlessly analysed and they do a whole parade of \"softball\" magazine and newspaper interviews. They chat to Elle, Home Journal, Parade and appear on Oprah Winfrey's show. \"It is a guaranteed win-win. You get soft ball questions and they tend to be more popular than their husbands. You would be a fool not to send them out there,\" said Watson.</p> <p>The crowds flocking to see them were not complaining. Mary Faro, a local academic, had waited for three hours to the see the First Lady come to Broward. \"And I'd do it again. Happily,\" she explained. Supporters at the Ann Romney rally felt the same. \"When she speaks, she speaks from the heart. You can sense a phoney, and Ann Romney is very genuine,\" said Hib Theriault, a retired army colonel.</p> <p>All of which explains why the candidates' wives have been so active as the election enters it final and fiercest phase. They are both succeeding at the part of politics that is more a high school contest popularity contest than a policy debate. \"Not all voters like policy. It's like the prom king and queen, and no one tells a person's story as well as their spouse,\" said Watson.</p>",

  "<p>Mitt Romney came to the battleground state of Ohio on Thursday and brazenly stole Barack Obama's clothes. He presented himself as the agent of \"big change\" and repeatedly accused the president of being the candidate of the status quo.</p> <p>In the final stop of a single day's three-point dash from the south-west to the north-west of the state, Romney echoed the message that Obama had brought to this electoral ground zero just four years ago. \"Paul Ryan and I represent a big change for America,\" he told a high school football stadium filled in the north-west town of Defiance, his voice growing hoarse.</p> <p>\"We're finally going to tackle the problems politicians have spoken about for years but haven't been willing to deal with,\" he said. With further parallels to the Obama message of 2008, he added that to get the job done in Washington he would \"reach across the aisle\".</p> <p>There was no sign of any waning in the momentum that the Republican nominee has enjoyed since the Denver TV presidential debate. The stadium was packed to overflowing, supporters having queued for two hours in a line that snaked right around the high school \u2013 another striking '08 echo.</p> <p>The official tally for the event was 12,000 people, which was impressive given that the population of Defiance is 16,000. \"This is a big event for a small town,\" said Jason Tackett, 26, attending the rally. \"I've never seen anything like it in all my life here.\"</p> <p>The town takes its name from the way General Anthony Wayne described a fort built here in the war against the Native Americans: \"I defy the English, Indians and all the devils of hell to take it.\"</p> <p>Romney came here with more than a little of that spirit. It took defiance to come to Defiance because not two miles out of the town is a massive General Motors plant, an iron and aluminium foundary that makes engine blocks.</p> <p>The Obama re-election campaign has been <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgiuq2uR6LA\">pounding the area with TV and radio adverts</a> reminding voters that in the 2008 crash Romney argued that the auto industry should be allowed to go bankrupt. The $87bn in federal loans that the Obama administration extended to GM and Chrysler, located just up the road in Toledo, have provided one of the great fault lines of the election this year, with Obama presenting himself as the savior of the auto industry and Romney on the defensive.</p> <p>Unemployment in Defiance is 6.7%, well below the national average of 7.8%.</p> <p>A small demonstration of Obama supporters at the entrance to Defiance high school included several workers from the GM plant. \"If GM had gone bankrupt this town would have been destroyed. Hospital, schools, lawyers, restaurants, you name it, everything would have gone down,\" said Veronica Estrada, 43.</p> <p>But there were also several GM workers, and other employees of subsidiaries dependant on the GM plant, inside the stadium supporting Romney. John Vogel, 29, who works for a sub-contractor of GM, dismissed Obama's claim to having saved the industry.</p> <p>\"It's the people that do the work that saved GM, not the politicians,\" he said.</p> <p>A contractor who works for all of the large car companies called Jim, 52, (he declined to give his last name) disputed that Romney would have let GM go bankrupt in any case. \"He had a plan to reorganise it, he wanted to see GM go through a managed rebuilding.\"</p> <p>In Jim's opinion, unionised companies like GM were starting to wish they'd done more to restructure themselves. \"A lot of them are beginning to realise they are hanging on but not getting stronger.\"</p> <p>Rob Portman, the Republican senator for Ohio who was a contender for vice-presidential nominee before Romney chose Ryan to be his running mate, addressed the auto bailout head on in his speech to the Defiance crowd. He began by admitting that he had supported the auto bailout, but then went on to accuse Obama of lying about Romney's position.</p> <p>\"There is no question in my mind that Mitt Romney's policies for the future are going to be better for our auto companies, for the workers, for communities like Defiance. Folks, if you are an auto worker here tonight I can tell you this \u2013 we need to elect Mitt Romney as next president of the United States.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/oh/ohio_romney_vs_obama-1860.html\">latest polls on Ohio</a> vary slightly with two \u2013 CBS News / Quinnipiac and Time showing Obama with a still robust five point lead but all the others recording an effective tie between the presidential rivals. The crucial importance of the state comes down to the fact that unless Romney wins its crop of 18 electoral votes out of the 270 needed to win, he will find it virtually impossible to win the presidency.</p> <p>Victory for Romney without Ohio would require him to sweep other swing states and take either Nevada or Wisconsin.</p> <p>Part of the attraction of Romney for the Defiance crowd was on religious grounds. The town is heavily Catholic, with a strong socially conservative bent.</p> <p>Debra Scheub, 55, said that watching the presidential debates had given new energy to the Republican campaign. \"Everybody got to see the man for themselves. They saw he was a viable candidate, and we learned a lot about his character and how he carries himself as a disciplined man.\"</p>",
  "<p>Last month, Vanity Fair featured <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2012/10/michael-lewis-profile-barack-obama\">a major profile of President Obama</a> by Michael Lewis, who was given what <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/11/a-journalist-with-rare-access-to-obama-had-to-play-by-quote-rule/\">the New York Times called</a> \"rare\" and \"extraordinary access\". Lewis \"conducted multiple interviews with the president\"; \"rode in the official presidential limousine\"; \"was given a special lapel pin that identified him to the Secret Service as someone who was allowed to be in close proximity to the president\"; and \"flew with the president on several foreign and domestic trips\" -- \"not with the rest of the press corps in the back of Air Force One, but near the front.\" And, noted the Times, \"the president even allowed Mr. Lewis to play on his basketball team.\"</p> <p>But in exchange for such access, Lewis, unbeknownst to readers of his profile, had agreed to a journalistically corrupt practice - now <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/us-news-blog/2012/sep/20/new-york-times-bans-quote-approval\">banned by many large media outlets</a> - whereby the only quotes he was permitted to use were ones the White House approved in advance. Unsurprisingly, the profile was pure hagiography that left Obama's most devoted media fans <a href=\"http://andrewsullivan.thedailybeast.com/2012/09/how-to-be-president.html\">gushing with ecstacy</a>.</p> <p>Though I would have thought it impossible, Rolling Stone somehow just managed to top that profile when it comes to sycophantic, power-worshiping \"journalism\". This week, it features <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/obama-and-the-road-ahead-the-rolling-stone-interview-20121025\">a cover story on Obama</a> by its contributing editor, the historian Douglas Brinkley, largely based on a 45-minute interview in the Oval Office. The questions Brinkley posed are so vapid and reverent that it is hard to believe it's not satire.</p> <p>Most of his questions are some iteration of asking Obama: <em>Seriously, how heinous is Mitt Romney? How gross is he? And really, how great are you?</em> Just behold some of the questions which this historian and journalist - given the opportunity for a one-on-one interview with the president of the United States - chose to ask, beginning with the first four of the interview:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Let's start with how the campaign has been going. Ever since the first debate, Romney has abruptly shifted his position on a whole host of issues, from his tax plan to financial regulation [that's the entirety of his first \"question\"]. </p> <p>\"Many observers have commented on how Romney has misrepresented or even changed his positions in this last leg of the campaign \u2013 that he's been like a chameleon on plaid. Do you feel that he has lied to the American people? </p> <p>\"Where were you when you first saw Romney's speech in Boca Raton about the 47 percent? What was your first reaction? </p> <p>\"What has surprised you the most about the Republican campaign this year? </p> <p>\"You said, 'a.k.a. Obamacare.' Do you mind if historians call the achievement Obamacare?</p> <p>\"You sometimes use the term 'fair shake'. FDR had the New Deal, Lyndon Johnson had the Great Society. Is the Fair Shake something you'd be comfortable with to describe your legacy? </p> <p>\"The auto bailout helped rescue states like Ohio from economic disaster. What, in turn, have you learned from the people of Ohio during your many visits to the state? </p> <p>\"Bill Clinton \u2013 how important is he as a surrogate for you? What's your friendship with him like these days? </p> <p>\"Halloween's coming up. If you could have Mitt Romney dress in a costume, what should he be for Halloween?\" </p> </blockquote> <p>If nothing else, shouldn't a concern for his own dignity lead Brinkley to have at least a pretense of adversarial substance? An interview of Obama by White House Press Secretary Jay Carney would have been more challenging. Had Brinkley had more time, next on his list of questions undoubtedly included: \"Do you believe Romney is more like Hitler or Satan?\", and \"Sir, do you mind that historians will likely see you as a mix of Gandhi and Jesus?\"</p> <p>Ample ink is spilled over debating whether the US media is biased in favor of Republicans or Democrats. It is neither. The overwhelming, driving bias of the US media is subservience to power, whoever happens to be wielding it.</p> <p>That is what explains why the US media has been so obsequious first with George Bush and now with his Democratic successor (for those who doubt that \"the liberal media\" venerated Bush as much as Lewis and Brinkely do Obama, I'll remind you of <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/research/2006/04/27/mission-accomplished-a-look-back-at-the-medias/135513\">this still-remarkable, borderline pornographic display of giddy fawning</a> on Mission Accomplished Day, or the fact that Bush's own Press Secretary <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2008/05/28/mcclellan_6/\">wrote a book</a> mocking the US media for how \"deferential\" it was to the Bush White House). It's why journalists <a href=\"http://wonkette.com/402599/david-gregory-famous-for-one-thing-dancing\">joyously dance with top officials</a>, <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/2008/10/tire_swinging_the_alternative.php\">swing on their tires</a>, are <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/06/07/washington_3/\">creepily grateful when they're sprayed in the face by their squirt guns</a>, and <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/21/a-football-draw-for-romneys-staff-and-the-press/\">play fun beach games with the very campaign officials they're ostensibly covering</a>.</p> <p>The central function, the religion, of the US establishment media is adulation of those who wield power, <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/05/03/nbc_news_top_hagiographer/\">especially military power</a> as personified by the <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2008/11/02/biden_12/\">inaptly referred to</a> \"commander-in-chief\". Brinkley conducted the interview in the Oval Office from his knees because - with some significant exceptions - that's the posture which US media culture assumes in the presence of the royal court.</p> <p>What makes this most ironic, and most destructive, is that this function is the exact antithesis of what media figures claim they perform and what pioneers of press freedom protections envisioned. The political media is designed to be adversarial because it is supposed to serve as a scrutinizing check on the claims of those in power, not serve as worshipful, propagandistic amplifiers of those claims. </p> <p>If, as is obviously the case, Brinkley desperately craves Obama's re-election, that's fine. But as a journalist and historian, there are all sorts of dubious assertions and controversial actions on the part of the president that merit questioning and challenge. One would think that minimal intellectual curiosity, or at least base professional self-esteem, would prevent someone like Brinkley from completely squandering this opportunity by taking the time he was given to flatter and serve the president.</p> <p>But one would be wrong. He was given this time and access precisely because the White House knew how and toward what end he would use it. In other words, they knew he was a typical member of the US press corps and his behavior would therefore be reverent in the extreme. One cannot blame the White House for exploiting those eager to spit up hagiography masquerading as journalism. The fault lies with those who deceive the public by holding themselves out as journalists.</p>",

  "<p>John Sununu, a top adviser to Mitt Romney's presidential campaign, has suggested that Colin Powell endorsed President Obama because both men are black.</p> <p>Speaking on <a href=\"http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2012/10/john-sununu-plays-race-card/58387/\">Piers Morgan Tonight</a> on CNN about Powell's endorsement, Sununu suggested policy had not been the main reason for Powell supporting the president. He said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Frankly, when you take a look at Colin Powell, you have to wonder whether that's an endorsement based on issues or whether he's got a slightly different reason for preferring President Obama.</p> </blockquote> <p>Prodded lightly by Morgan about what those reasons might be he did not hesitate to expand: </p> <blockquote> <p>Well, I think when you have somebody of your own race that you're proud of being president of the United States, I applaud Colin for standing with him.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/apps/cvp/3.0/swf/cnn_416x234_embed.swf?context=embed&amp;videoId=bestoftv/2012/10/26/pmt-sununu.cnn\"> <object width=\"416\" height=\"374\" classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\" id=\"ep\"><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\" /><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/apps/cvp/3.0/swf/cnn_416x234_embed.swf?context=embed&videoId=bestoftv/2012/10/26/pmt-sununu.cnn\" /><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\" /><embed src=\"https://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/apps/cvp/3.0/swf/cnn_416x234_embed.swf?context=embed&videoId=bestoftv/2012/10/26/pmt-sununu.cnn\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" bgcolor=\"#000000\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" width=\"416\" wmode=\"transparent\" height=\"374\"></embed></object> </figure>  <p>Morgan brought the interview quickly to a close. But <a href=\"http://www.kpho.com/story/19920987/john-sununu-top-romney-adviser-criticized-fof-racial\">reaction</a> to Sununu's comments came quickly. </p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Toure\">Tour\u00e9</a></strong>, the co-host of <a href=\"http://tv.msnbc.com/shows/the-cycle/\">MSNBC's The Cycle</a>, tweeted:</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p>John Sununu supports Romney.

Piers Morgan's question was whether Colin Powell should leave the party, and I don't think he should.</p> </blockquote> <p>Surprisingly enough, Powell made no mention of race when <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505263_162-57539893/colin-powell-endorses-barack-obama-for-president/\">he endorsed Obama for a second time</a>. </p> <p>Instead he praised Obama's handling of the economy in difficult times and expressed support for a range of his policies including healthcare reform, climate change and national security. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398418460\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/10/17/powell84.jpg\" alt=\"Colin Powell\" width=\"140\" height=\"84\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When he took over, the country was in very very difficult straits. We were in one of the worst recessions we had seen in recent times, close to a depression. The fiscal system was collapsing. Wall Street was in chaos. We had 800,000 jobs lost in that first month of the Obama administration and unemployment peaked a few months later at 10%. So we were in real trouble. The auto industry was collapsing, the housing was start[ing] to collapse and we were in very difficult straits.</p> <p>And I saw over the next several years, stabilisation come back in the financial community. Housing is now starting to pick up after four years, it's starting to pick up. Consumer confidence is rising.</p> <p>Powell also criticised Romney, suggesting he appeared to have changed his stance on some issues:</p> <blockquote> <p>The governor who was saying things at the debate on Monday night ... was saying things that were quite different from what he said earlier. I'm not quite sure which Governor Romney we would be getting with respect to foreign policy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Powell's second endorsement of Obama <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/25/john-mccain-colin-powell_n_2017411.html\">has clearly riled his fellow Republican party members</a>. </p> <p><strong>John McCain</strong> played the role of the disappointed parent.

The percentage taking advantage of early voting is far higher than in 2008, especially in the swing states, testimony to the intensity of the door-to-door operations. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2012/10/25/post-abc-tracking-poll-romney-50-percent-obama-47/\">A Washington Post-ABC tracking poll</a> released on Thursday shows Mitt Romney ahead of the president for the first time in the campaign, winning 50% of likely voters, ahead of Obama's 47%.</p> <p>The president, dispensing with the usual ritual of voting on election day to provide television footage, returned to his hometown to raise awareness about voting early by casting his ballot. At the voting station, he said: \"This is the first time a president's ever going to be early voting.\"</p> <p>He was asked for his driver's licence and joked: \"Now ignore the fact that there's no grey hair in that picture.\" The official who took his licence gave it the sceptical examination that has become routine when dealing with officialdom in America. Obama laughed and mimicked her expression, before heading off to cast his ballot, presumably for himself and other Democrats on the long list of candidates seeking office.</p> <p>The Obama team is backing this up with an ad warning that only a relatively few votes determined the outcome of the 2000 election. The ad is titled 537, the number of votes that gave Bush victory in Florida \u2013 \"the difference between what was and what could have been\".</p> <p>\"So this year if you're thinking that your vote doesn't count, that it won't matter, well, back then there were probably 537 people who felt the same way. Make your voice heard,\" the ad says.</p> <p>Obama's campaign spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, said Obama was ahead of where he was four years ago in terms of early voting and winning in Iowa, Ohio and Wisconsin. The president's early vote would send a signal to voters that \"this is something they should do too,\" she said.</p> <p>The Democratic push reflects concern that apathy might see supporters fail to make the effort to vote on 6 November, especially if the weather is bad. It also pre-empts any last-minute surprises such as bad unemployment figures.</p> <p>Republicans tend to be better at turning out in large numbers on election day.</p> <p>Michael McDonald, associate professor at George Mason University, who monitors early voting, said almost 400,000 had cast their vote in Iowa, about 30% of the likely final tally, and about one million in Ohio, around 20%.</p> <p>\"In Iowa, you could conclude that Obama is not doing as well as in 2008 when he won by 9%. The early voting shows him with a smaller lead than 2008, but still ahead by 4% to 5%,\" McDonald said. \"In Ohio, who knows? It is just a mess, with lots of activity by both campaigns.\"</p> <p>He added: \"If I was a betting man, I would put it on Obama. If he wins Wisconsin, Ohio and Iowa, he wins. If Romney loses Iowa, it is difficult for him. If he loses Ohio, it is almost impossible for him to win. It all comes down to Ohio.\"</p> <p>Reflecting that, both Romney and Obama spent part of the day in Ohio. <br>The Romney campaign released its latest fundraising figures, showing a big haul over the first few weeks of this month. It raised $111.8m between October 1 and 17. Figures for the Federal Election Commission show there were 794,958 donations to the Romney campaign, 92% of them of $250 or less. It has $169m cash in hand.</p> <p>Obama received a boost when George W Bush's secretary of state, Colin Powell, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/25/colin-powell-endorses-barack-obama\">came out in favour of the president</a>, just as he did in 2008. </p> <p>\"You know, I voted for him in 2008 and I plan to stick with him in 2012 and will vote for him and vice-president Joe Biden next month,\" Powell told CBS News. He praised Obama for his handling of the economic mess and for ending the war in Iraq, both inherited from Bush.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the normally disciplined Obama made a gaffe that could anger Republicans, indirectly describing Mitt Romney in a Rolling Stone magazine interview as a \"bullshitter\".</p> <p>McDonald warned that this remark could provoke Republicans. \"Coaches warn players not to badmouth the other team. You do not want to rile them up.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 26 October 2012. In the original version, $1bn dollars was wrongly converted to \u00a3620,000. </p>",

They found that a victory by the local team on the Saturday 10 days prior to election day increased the incumbent party\u2019s vote share by 1.13 percentage points.</p> <p>But the effect was even stronger for what the researchers classified as \u201chigh-attendance teams,\u201d defined as the teams with highest average home attendance from 1998 to 2007. Ohio State is on this list. The study found that when these high-attendance teams win on on the Saturday 10 days prior to election day, the incumbent party gained 3.09 percentage points.</p> </blockquote> <p>So if Ohio State wins, Obama gets a boost at the ballot box on election day.
