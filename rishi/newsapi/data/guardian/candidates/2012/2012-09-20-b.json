  "<p>Declaring that the practice had \"gone too far,\" the New York Times on Thursday banned reporters from agreeing to give sources quote approval before publication.</p> <p>\"Starting now, we want to draw a clear line on this,\" reads <a href=\"http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/20/in-new-policy-the-times-forbids-after-the-fact-quote-approval/\">an internal memo quoted by the Times' current public editor</a>, Margaret Sullivan, who had <a href=\"http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/17/the-times-needs-a-policy-on-quotation-approval-and-soon/http://\">called for such guidelines</a> in a column just days earlier. \"Citing Times policy, reporters should say no if a source demands, as a condition of an interview, that quotes be submitted afterward to the source or a press aide to review, approve or edit.\"</p> <p>The change comes after weeks of public debate over quote approval, which has become routine for reporters covering the presidential campaign. Top advisers to both President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney typically demand quote approval as a condition to granting interviews.</p> <p>Given the intensity of competition for interviews with top campaign figures, and the value of those conversations in gaining insight into the presidential race, reporters are under pressure to go along with demands for quotation review. </p> <p>Colorful language, out-of-order opinion and impolitic digression all are stripped in the process. Copy suffers; campaigns already rendered dull by modern message discipline and the ubiquity of recording devices show even less vitality in print. </p> <p>The Times appears to have put in place a more strict proscription against quote approval than news organizations such as Reuters and Politico, which discourage but do not ban the practice.</p> <p>The Times memo says that \"demands for after-the-fact quote approval by sources and their press aides have gone too far\".</p> <p>\"The practice risks giving readers a mistaken impression that we are ceding too much control over a story to our sources,\" it says. \"In its most extreme form, it invites meddling by press aides and others that goes far beyond the traditional negotiations between reporter and source over the terms of an interview.\"</p> <p>Ari Fleischer, a former spokesman for George Bush, <a href=\"http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/189170/the-new-york-times-bans-quote-approval/ \">traces the practice to Bush's second term</a>, Poynter noted.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama has described lack of immigration reform as the biggest failure of his presidency, but blamed his inability to legalise millions of undocumented immigrants on what he implicitly admitted was another failure \u2013 the collapse of his attempts at compromise and consensus with Congress and the realisation that he \"cannot change Washington from the inside\".</p> <p>Obama was repeatedly pressed on immigration by a mostly Latino audience in an interview on the Spanish-language Univision TV station in Miami. He was forced to defend his record on deportations of illegal immigrants and to deny that his order in July allowing about 1.7 million young undocumented migrants to obtain work permits was an election ploy.</p> <p>Obama was also accused of breaking a promise, made during the 2008 presidential election campaign, to permit a path to citizenship or residency for many undocumented immigrants during his first year in office.</p> <p>Asked later in the interview what the greatest failure of his presidency has been, Obama returned to the topic.</p> <p>\"My biggest failure so far is [that] we haven't gotten comprehensive immigration reform done,\" the president said. \"But it's not for lack of trying or desire \u2013 and I'm confident that we're going to accomplish that.\"</p> <p>Obama denied he had broken his promise and went on to blame his inability \"to change the tone in Washington\" for the lack of an immigration reform law. He said that as soon as he came to power, Republicans conspired to block him.</p> <p>Obama said he could not find a single Republican to work with him on immigration legislation. He said he had been \"naive\".</p> <p>\"The most important lesson I've learned is that you can't change Washington from the inside; you can only change it from the outside. That's how I got elected and that's how the big accomplishments like healthcare got done, was because we mobilised the American people to speak out,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Something I'd really like to concentrate on in my second term is being in a much more constant conversation with the American people so that they can put pressure on Congress to help move some of these issues forward.\"</p> <p>Opinion polls show Latino voters to be twice as likely to vote for Obama as Romney, but many votes are up for grabs in some battleground states such as Florida.</p> <p>The Republicans, keen to go on the offensive after a torrid two weeks, immediately pounced on the remarks, with Mitt Romney repeatedly mentioning them during a speech in Sarasota. Claiming that the president had broken a promise made in 2008, Romney said: \"His slogan was: 'Yes we can'. Now it's: 'No I can't'.\"</p> <p>On Twitter, Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, wrote: \"Between no immigration reform and can't change DC from the inside, seems like Obama just admitted his 08 campaign was garbage.\"</p> <p>The Univision audience questioned Obama on issues that rarely get much of an airing in the US English-language media, such as combating Mexico's drug cartels.</p> <p>But the primary focus was on immigration, a source of considerable concern in Hispanic communities where families often have relatives or friends who are in the US illegally.</p> <p>Obama was pressed on why there has been a rise in deportations of illegal immigrants under his presidency. He said that it was in part because Congress put more money into enforcing border controls. Nonetheless, he said the target of deportation is not \"hard-working families\" and those with long ties to the US.</p> <p>\"More than half of our enforcement now is directed at people with criminal records. Of the remaining half, about two-thirds are people who are typically apprehended close to the border. So these are not people who have long standing roots,\" he said.</p> <p>But he added: \"We still ultimately have to change the laws.\"</p> <p>Although Obama faced strong scepticism at times, he appeared to emerge in better shape than his Republican rival, after Romney a similar appearance on Wednesday on Univision, a principal source of news for a large number of Latino voters.</p> <p>Romney was accused of evading questions about whether he would deport undocumented aliens, including the young people Obama ordered should be permitted to stay. Eventually an exasperated Romney said: \"We're not going to round up 12 million people, that includes kids and parents, and have them all deported.\"</p> <p>Romney said that as president he would find a \"permanent solution\" to an immigration system that has \"been broken for years\". This included temporary work permits and permanent residency cards to people with advanced qualifications. </p> <p>But he repeatedly refused to say whether he would overturn Obama's order permitting young illegal immigrants without a criminal record to remain in the US and obtain a work permit.</p> <p>\"These kids deserve something better than temporary \u2013 they deserve a permanent position,\" Romney said without offering a specific alternative.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Romney said he favoured policies to promote \"self-deportation\" of illegal immigrants, but he downplayed that on Wednesday.</p> <p>Rommey's attempt to woo Hispanic voters was further damaged on Thursday with the emergence of a clip from a video of a Romney fundraiser in which he said that illegal immigrants generally \"have no skill or experience\".</p> <p>\"Gosh, I'd love to bring in more legal immigrants that have skill and knowledge. I'd like to staple a green card to every PhD in the world and say, 'Come to America, we want you here.' Instead, we make it hard for people who get educated here or elsewhere to make this their home,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Unless, of course, you have no skill or experience, in which case you're welcome to cross the border and stay here for the rest of your life. It's very strange.\"</p> <p>Obama took the opportunity to take a jab at Romney over other parts of the fundraiser video which has been leaked in recent days - particularly Romney's assertion that the half of American voters who support Obama pay no income tax, rely on the government for handouts and think of themselves as victims.</p> <p>Obama said Romney is out of touch.</p> <p>\"When you express an attitude that half the country considers itself victims, that somehow they want to be dependent on government, my thinking is maybe you haven't gotten around a lot,'\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Kanye West's penchant for superabundance is one of the most exhilirating things in pop music. Where others might make do with a single producer, Kanye will have three&#xa0;and finish it up himself when they're not looking. While other rappers will showcase their lesser-talented mates, Kanye signs Common&#xa0;and Clipse's Pusha T. As for guest vocalists, why not&#xa0;R Kelly, John&#xa0;Legend and The D.R.E.A.M? All appear on this impromptu project that's somewhere between album and mixtape: some tracks coming over like sketches;&#xa0;others as pastiches of hip-hop trends. Either way, Cruel Summer has more highlights than most long-gestated efforts, from Kels's To the World and its operatic chorus, to Jay Z's verse on Clique or Kid Cudi's plaintive emo R&amp;B&#xa0;on Creepers. But while the ear-catching moments belong to the guests, West's touch is detectable everywhere and in the refrain, \"Mitt Romney don't pay no tax\", he may have the best line on the album. This isn't just a side project, this is a Kanye side-project.</p>",
  "<p>Like many African Americans, I grew up thinking of the Emancipation Proclamation as a totemic document. Abraham Lincoln \u2013 the ambiguity of his persona notwithstanding \u2013 was a kind of god to my family, an immortal whose words sparked a new epoch: a dream made manifest. The Emancipation Proclamation was magic \u2013 a tribute to power of naming to call forth something from nothing.</p> <p>As an adult \u2013 and as a lawyer \u2013 I now see the Emancipation Proclamation as exemplary not only of the liberatory power of language, but of the complex relation between legal utterances and how they are put into effect by the institutions of government. The commands of executives and the sentences of judges depend on a supporting hierarchy of institutional actors, a faithful community of acolytes, a legion of believers in the justice of a particular system.</p> <p>The violent word is always relatively easy to enact. For it is a complicated reality of our democracy that the general rituals of condemnation run with extreme efficiency: police, jurors, wardens, legislators coordinate who is disciplined or enfranchised, in or out of incarceration, dead or alive.</p> <p>The liberatory word, on the other hand \u2013 that which commands new life, or orders political regeneration \u2013 that word always seems harder, more amorphous. Or is it, perhaps, that we don't have the institutional hierarchy or community of agents who might be charged with regeneration and social healing?</p> <p>If not magic then, I do think that the Emancipation Proclamation was a kind of miracle.</p> <p>Today, we have urgent need of new proclamations from which new miracles might spring. For such a prodigiously endowed nation, the United States has the widest <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-12/u-s-poverty-rate-stays-at-almost-two-decade-high-income-falls.html\">gap between rich and poor</a>, among the most <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/07/11/segregation_in_urban_schools_salpart/\">racially segregated educational systems</a> in the developed world, and close to the <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21555611\">highest rate of incarceration</a> on the planet. We know this to be true. And yet, <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/150743/Obama-Romney.aspx\">46</a>% of the American electorate support Mitt Romney for our next president \u2013 a man who <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/secret-video-romney-private-fundraiser\">recently disparaged the other \"47%\"</a> who intend to support President Obama, as \"victims, who believe that government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it\".</p> <p>Martin Luther King Jr called the American project an endless <a href=\"http://www.ajc.org/site/apps/nl/content3.asp?c=ijITI2PHKoG&amp;b=843719&amp;ct=1052923\">moral commitment</a>; that commitment to regeneration seems endangered at the moment. If I had the power of magic words, I would speak into being an Edict of Education, a Provision of Health and Welfare, an Encyclical of Enfranchisement and a Mandate for a Goodly Mixing of our promised Melting Pot.</p>",
  "<blockquote> <p>\"After taking a beating for comments he privately wishes he never made and from conservative critics he wishes he could muzzle, Mitt Romney and his campaign are settling on a rescue plan to show more of him \u2013 in ads, speeches and campaign appearances. A big focus, according to campaign officials, will be on Romney talking a lot more about how his ideas will help regular Americans who remain deeply suspicious of him.\" \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0912/81428.html?hp=t1\">Politico</a></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>From:</strong> Stuart Stevens, Chief Campaign Strategist<br><strong>To:</strong> Mitt Romney<br><strong>Subject:</strong> Rescue Plan</p> <p>Mitt \u2013</p> <p>I was alarmed to hear you'd spent the morning at the back of the campaign bus, with the blinds down, rocking and moaning softly while scrolling in a desultory fashion through <a href=\"http://www.yachtworld.com\">YachtWorld.com</a> on your iPad. Now is not the time to lose heart! Don't worry about <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/20/post-convention-polling-obama-consolidates-lead\">the polling</a> \u2013 that only goes to show that the majority of the American population is out of touch with America. Here's the plan I've drawn up with the rest of the team. Let's discuss ASAP.</p> <p>First, an update on our \"debunking\" strategy. It's going great! Based on our media team's analysis of the <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner\">National Review Online</a> (it's a website that \"reviews\" the whole \"nation\", so we don't need to bother with other sources \u2013 clever, huh?), our message on the \"47% tape\" is getting through. Who knows how warmly you might have spoken about America's worthless freeloading loser scum in those missing minutes? Now it's time to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DJGilchrist/status/248551820601991168/photo/1\">double down</a> and debunk more things. Bad polls? Debunked! The widespread feeling that putting you in charge of America's nuclear arsenal would be utterly, utterly terrifying? Debunked!</p> <p>The carping leftwing criticism that you don't debunk something merely by stating that it's been debunked? Debunked!</p> <p>Now for the plan. Two words: more Mitt. Clearly, our problem so far has been a lack of spontaneous, ill-thought-through public statements from you. So it's time to <a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/timstanley/100178194/romney-can-make-the-republican-convention-into-a-vote-winner-if-the-party-will-only-let-mitt-be-mitt/\">let Mitt be Mitt</a>. When Americans finally see the teetotal, non-coffee-drinking, multimillionaire dressage enthusiast behind the facade (<a href=\"http://wonkette.com/484700/mitt-romney-dons-brownface-for-forum-with-mexicans\">and the make-up?</a>), how can they fail to love you? The other day, we reached out to Thomas Friedman for <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/blog/jonathan-chait/84059/tom-friedmans-volcano-wakeup-call\">some strategic guidance</a>, and I really liked the way he put it: the solution to this death spiral is to put more fuel in the car, turn the ship around, and to issue a wake-up call of volcanic proportions to the world's midwives.</p> <p>Some specifics: the team all agrees you have to \"own your message\". On further investigation, it turns out that nobody has a clue what this phrase means, but we think it means you need to sound like you believe what you're saying. Back in the old days, the way to do this was to say things you believed in. But this ain't your father's election campaign! Your best bet for now is to <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/karyna/mitt-romney-looking-longingly-at-people\">look longingly at the camera</a>, which conveys empathy. (Empathy is the capacity to experience a fellow human's emotions.) </p> <p>Second, you'll need to look more relaxed in public. Open-collar's working well, but we need you to go to the next level: unbuttoned collar-buttons on your button-down shirts. Try it alone in a hotel room first if you like, just to get used to it. You might feel an excited thrill, a bodily quiver. But that's nothing to be ashamed of. After all, we're not suggesting you unbutton the second shirt button, like some kind of European or something, for Pete's sake!</p> <p>Third: we need to get specific on how your plans will help ordinary, hardworking families. Next week, we'll release Mitt Romney's 5,623-Point Plan For Building A Stronger Middle Class. Then, minutes later, we'll orchestrate a gaffe where you accidentally insult the nation of Andorra. By the time the fuss has subsided, the news cycle will have moved on, and we can refer to the 5,623 points without being challenged on them.</p> <p>Fourth \u2013 the big one \u2013 we're going to send you, in a reality-TV-style operation, to spend a week living with an Ordinary American Family. You'll share their ups and downs, you'll go to the football game with them, you'll sleep in their guest room, and you'll eat what they eat, though obviously we'll provide specially sanitised silverware and <a href=\"http://www.magellans.com/store/Health___Hygiene___Bed_Bug_PreventionSC546\">sheet liners</a>. This will be a game-changer. And if it isn't, then, following the \"debunking\" strategy, we'll just say it is, and then it will be! </p> <p>Finally, I know you'll be aware of suggestions from certain quarters that you need to fire your chief campaign strategist yesterday. But my advice to you is not to listen to them \u2013 and after all, I'm your chief campaign strategist, so I know what I'm talking about! As Friedman likes to say, never switch horses in heavy traffic without an iron fist.</p> <p>We can win this thing!</p> <p>Talk soon,</p> <p>Stuart</p>",
  "<p>The political TV advertisement featuring Binyamin Netanyahu and the slogan \"The world needs American strength, not apologies\" is likely to fuel claims that the Israeli prime minister is interfering in the US presidential election in support of Republican candidate Mitt Romney.</p> <p>It comes increasing during anxiety that Netanyahu has overplayed his hand in displays of warmth and enthusiasm for Romney while his relationship with Barack Obama grows more antagonistic. Some say Netanyahu is gambling too heavily on a Romney victory on November 6 and that if Obama is re-elected, the potential blowback could be damaging not just for the prime minister but for Israel itself.</p> <p>Mark Regev, Netanyahu's spokesman, said the advertisement had \"not been co-ordinated with us, we were not consulted and no one asked us for our permission\". In an interview last week with the Jerusalem Post, the Israeli prime minister rejected accusations of interference in the election, saying they were \"completely groundless\".</p> <p>But, according to Yossi Verter writing in Haaretz recently, US officials had relayed to a \"very senior Israeli figure\" that \"in the eyes of the Democratic administration, Netanyahu is perceived as campaigning on behalf of Mitt Romney.\" To the president and his aides, the Israeli prime minister's actions look like \"crude, vulgar and unrestrained intervention in the US election campaign\".</p> <p>Joe Klein of Time magazine described Netanyahu's recent behaviour as \"an unprecedented attempt by a putative American ally to influence a US presidential campaign\".</p> <p>The editor of the New Yorker, David Remnick, said Netanyahu seemed \"determined, more than ever, to alienate the president of the United States and, as an ally of Mitt Romney's campaign, to make himself a factor in the 2012 election\".</p> <p>Netanyahu's categoric denial of interference followed a leak by Israeli officials that Obama had declined to meet the Israeli prime minister during his visit to the US later this month. US officials denied there had been a deliberate rebuff. Some observers believed the story was planted by Netanyahu aides in order to show the president in a poor light for snubbing the leader of one of America's closest allies.</p> <p>The Israeli leader's fury with Obama appeared to reach a new level after his failed attempt to use the US election to bounce the president into setting clear \"red lines\" beyond which America will take military action against Iran's nuclear programme. In a press conference \u2013 from which footage was taken for the television advertisement \u2013 Netanyahu said without red lines, there could be no US-imposed red light to military action.</p> <p>In contrast, Romney has indicated that an administration led by him would take a more hawkish stance. His chief aide, Dan Senor, hinted that Romney as president would back a unilateral Israeli military strike on Iran.</p> <p>In July, Netanyahu warmly welcomed Romney to Israel along with his chief financial backer Sheldon Adelson, who is also a staunch supporter of the Israeli prime minister. The billionaire Adelson owns Israel Hayom, a free newspaper which invariably backs Netanyahu and his rightwing coalition government.</p> <p>During his visit, Romney said: \"I would treat Israel like the friend and ally it is \u2026 I cannot imagine going to the United Nations, as Obama did, and criticising Israel in front of the world. You don't criticise your allies in public to achieve the applause of your foes. If there were places where we disagree, I would hold these disagreements in private conversations, not in public forums.\"</p> <p>Romney and Netanyahu also appear to share a common view on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which is to maintain the status quo rather than advance towards an independent state for the Palestinian people. In remarks secretly filmed in May and released this week, the Republican candidate said: \"This is going to remain an unsolved problem \u2026 We sort of live with it.\" This reflects Netanyahu's approach towards the so-called peace process since his election in March 2009.</p> <p>The rapport between the two rightwing politicians dates back to the 1970s when they both worked at the Boston Consulting Group.</p>",
  "<p>Fashion retailer SuperGroup, famed for its Superdry brand, has become the latest UK company to receive a bloody nose from shareholders after nearly one in five either failed to back or voted against the reelection of co-founder Julian Dunkerton.</p> <p>There were also robust votes against chairman Peter Bamford, non-executive directors Steven Glew and Indira Thambiah, and new chief operating officer Susanne Given.</p> <p>Concerns had been raised by shareholder groups before Thursday's annual general meeting, with the Association of British Insurers putting an \"amber alert\" on the retailer's remuneration report \u2013 its second most severe warning \u2013 while shareholder group Pirc also recommended investors vote against the pay proposals.</p> <p>The pay deal drawn up for Given, who was poached from John Lewis, was singled out for particular criticism as her package includes a \u00a3350,000 base salary, as well as a \"golden hello\" worth \u00a31.1m in shares. Almost 19% of investors either voted against her election as a director or abstained and nearly 17% failed to back the remuneration report.</p> <p>The votes against directors were substantial given Dunkerton, who owns 26m shares, is understood to have exercised his right to vote. But the last year has been a rollercoaster ride for investors who backed what was previously regarded as one of the most successful stock market flotations of recent years. After listing at 500p in 2010 shares in the company, famous for its trademark T-shirts, hooded tops, check shirts and jogging bottoms, rocketed to a high of nearly \u00a319. Since then a series of profit warnings and mistakes \u2013 including a misfiring IT system and accounting errors \u2013 have weighed heavily on the company's value.</p> <p>Last month the resignation of Theo Karpathios, who founded the business with Dunkerton, was added to the catalogue of woes. On Thursday the shares closed down 10p at 625p.</p> <p>With a profit alert in April partly blamed on a mix-up between a plus and a minus sign in its financial forecasts, investors appear to be concerned about the retailer's financial rigour. There was a large vote at the AGM against the reappointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers as auditors.</p> <p>SuperGroup's most recent figures, published last week, showed signs of light at the end of the tunnel for the retailer, whose celebrity fans include Pippa Middleton and singer Ed Sheeran, as it announced a rise in first quarter sales.</p>",
  "<p>One of Britain's allies in the Afghan war has been been sacked in a political shakeup by President Hamid Karzai that saw 10 provincial governors replaced or removed.</p> <p>Karzai announced he would remove Mohammad Gulab Mangal from office as governor of the vital province of Helmand, a central focus in the Afghan war and the responsibility of the British military.</p> <p>Karzai's office declined to say why Mangal had been removed or if he would be reappointed to another governorship or political position.</p> <p>The southern province was the centre of the Afghan drug trade and a Taliban stronghold, making it a focal point for NATO and Afghan officials. Helmand claimed nearly double the number of coalition soldiers' lives compared to Kandahar, the second most deadly province in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Mangal played a key role in efforts to regain control of the province, quickly winning favour among international military and diplomatic officials. When he came to office in Helmand in 2008, he'd held governorships continuously since 2004 starting in Paktika and then moving to Laghman.</p> <p>He presided over Helmand during one of the most critical periods of the war, overseeing the influx of surge troops as NATO forces launched the Marjah offensive in 2010, one of the biggest campaigns of the Afghan war.</p> <p>\"Before his governorship there was complete insecurity in the province,\" said Muhammad Hassan Haqyar, an independent political analyst in Kabul, who explained that the province saw major improvements under Mangal's watch. \"There were also the good relations he had with the foreigners. They were definitely good for the people of Helmand. If you have good relations with international organizations, it helps you bring reconstruction to the province.\"</p> <p>The British embassy in Kabul put out a statement saying Mangal \"made a real difference to the life of ordinary Afghans in Helmand\".</p> <p>Previous attempts to oust Mangal by Karzai led to direct intervention from senior British figures, as he was seen as a man with whom they could work.</p> <p>Still, in manyways Mangal remained a controversial figure. Despite his generally positive relations with foreigners, the release of the Wikileaks diplomatic cables in 2010 revealed that he did not always have glowing reviews of his international counterparts.</p> <p>In the cables, Mangal privately criticised the British military for not leaving their bases enough and having only limited interaction with the local population.</p> <p>Among locals, there were also allegations that Mangal and his administration used the poppy eradication program to extort farmers and generate revenue for his administration. While these allegations were never confirmed, they were common.</p> <p>Despite these allegations, a number of locals say that during Mangal's tenure as governor the province, witnessed dramatic improvements in both security and development.</p> <p>Habiba Sadat, a member of parliament from Helmand, says that while she never had any personal problems with the governor, he was regarded as a divisive figure in the province.</p> <p>\"When I myself used to go to Helmand people would come cry to me because they had problems with the current governor. Also the security problems have recently increased and there were several attacks against police and checkpoints,\" she says. \"This was the right decision. A lot of people in Helmand are happy about it.\"</p> <p>Throughout Afghanistan, a total of 10 governors, including Mangal, will be removed or reassigned. The move comes during efforts by the Karzai administration to improve government efficiency to address concerns among foreign donors.</p> <p>\"We needed to change some governors because some provinces need better governance and better governments, some provinces needed fresh blood, and some governors will change to other provinces,\" says Hamid Elmi, a spokesman for Karzai. \"Of course some governors were not able to carry out their duties and they were not efficient any more so we needed fresh blood.\"</p> <p>In Afghanistan, governors are appointed by the president rather than elected. The 10 provinces with new governors include Kabul, Helmand, Takhar, Faryab, Logar, Laghman, Wardak, Baghlan, Nimroz, and Badghis.</p>",

Not apologies.\"</p> <p>One of the nonprofit group's founders, <a href=\"http://rightweb.irc-online.org/profile/secure_america_now\">John McLaughlin</a>, was an adviser to Netanyahu's Likud party in 2006 and <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/news/likud-beefs-up-campaign-staff-with-schwarzenegger-aide-1.62523\">has also worked for former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>. As a 501(c)4 group devoted to \"social welfare\", the group is not required to disclose its donors.</p> <p>The ad is the latest in a series of appearances by Netanyahu in the heated US presidential election. The prime minister made a point of being photographed with Republican challenger Mitt Romney on his visit to Israel in July and praised the candidate's views on Iran. </p> <p>In a Jerusalem press conference on the 9/11 anniversary, Netanyahu criticized the Obama administration's refusal to notify Iran of a \"red line\" that would trigger an attack on its nuclear facilities. Complaints by the prime minister's office about Obama declining a meeting at the UN next week have been eagerly used by Republicans in attacks on the president.</p> <p>Netanyahu's <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2012/09/12/netanyahu_on_iran_wait_for_what_wait_until_when.html\">remarks in the ad</a> are sentences taken out of order from the 11 September press conference, which followed a meeting with the Bulgarian prime minister.</p> <p>The likelihood that the ad will have an impact on the US election is extremely small. Netanyahu, who has been fighting the erosion of his domestic political coalition, is a polarizing figure among Jewish voters, who support the president by a large 69-25 margin, <a href=\"http://www.ajc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=ijITI2PHKoG&amp;b=846741&amp;ct=12190055\">according to the latest poll by the American Jewish Committee</a>. </p> <p><a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/polls/219619-poll-2-in-3-us-jews-want-obama-reelected\">A single-digit minority of Jewish voters</a> say Israel policy is the most important factor in determining their votes. </p> <p><a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2012-florida-president-romney-vs-obama \">The president is also leading Romney in Florida</a>, according to most polls, with one by Fox News this week giving him a five-point advantage, 49-44.</p> <p>But the use of Netanyahu's remarks in an anti-Obama swing-state ad underlines the extent to which his unusually public attacks on the administration's policy have become intensely politicized, and could have deeper consequences for his relationship with the White House in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/20/post-convention-polling-obama-consolidates-lead\">apparently likely event </a>that Obama wins in November.</p> <p>Previous ads produced by Secure America Now include one from July called Are We Safer? that uses graphic footage of the 9/11 attacks and an actor warning that \"our president apologizes for America\".</p> <p><a href=\" http://www.iaea.org/newscenter/focus/iaeairan/iaea_reports.shtml\">The International Atomic Energy Agency reported</a> last month that Iran had installed more than 2,100 centrifuges inside a fortified underground facility known as Fordow and continues to produce nuclear fuel. </p> <p>Only about a third of the centrifuges are operating, however, and the program was not close to producing a sufficient quantity of sufficiently enriched fuel to produce a weapon, according to inspectors, who continue to have access to the site.</p>",
  "<p>Amid all the flip-flopping and dissembling of the 2012 election, it comes as a bit of a shock to hear one of the presidential candidates say that his interest in politics stemmed from the first time he smoked dope. But then there is much about Gary Johnson, the Libertarian party's nominee for the White House, that is strikingly out of the mould.</p> <p>\"I think marijuana played a role in my libertarianism, because when in 1970 I smoked it for the first time I realized that everything the government said about it was a lie,\" he said. \"You know, you smoke marijuana, you're going to go crazy, you'll want to commit crime, you are going to go to the depths and never return \u2026 None of that was true.\"</p> <p>From those teenaged dope-smoking beginnings, Johnson, now 59, went on to become a successful businessman and a Republican governor of New Mexico, and is now seeking to carry the libertarian flame lit by Ron Paul during the primary election season into November's presidential race. It's true that he and his Libertarian party are relative minnows in an election cycle dominated by big corporate money \u2013 he has raised just $2m for his presidential campaign compared to the hundreds of millions being poured into Barack Obama's and Mitt Romney's campaigns.</p> <p>But there are signs that in the key swing states where the election will be won or lost, he is having an impact that could prove important over the final 60 days of the race. Polls are so tight in states such as Ohio, Nevada, Colorado, Virginia that any deflection of votes away from the two main contenders could be significant.</p> <p><a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/09/10/spoiler-alert-poll-finds-small-following-for-libertarian-candidate/\">A CNN/ORC poll last week</a> put him at 4%, which may not sound much, but given that a number of key states are essential tied between Obama and Romney even that sliver could be crucial. The poll also found that his third-party bid, combined with Jill Stein of the Green party, is eating into Romney's support base more than it is the incumbent president's.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396442032\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/9/20/1348156424689/Gary-Johnson-004.jpg\" alt=\"Gary Johnson\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gary Johnson. Photograph: Orlando Sentinel/MCT/Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Orlando Sentinel/MCT/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That explains why the GOP is acting so aggressively against him. They have tried to keep Johnson off the ballot in at least five states \u2013 Ohio and Virginia where they have already failed to do so, and Michigan, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania where court challenges are still ongoing.</p> <p>Johnson, talking in New York where he was on a media blitz, said he was unfazed by the Republican attempts to block him. He vowed that come November he would be on the ballot in all 50 states, which is not an idle promise as he is already included in 45 states.</p> <p>\"These challenges against me are just railroad jobs: it's straight out of the Wild West. I think it's a testament to the strength of our campaign that they are going to these lengths. The Republicans are afraid of me taking away votes from Romney: that's the bottom line.\"</p> <p>He might lack the riches that Ross Perot was able to inject into his third-party bid in 1992 \u2013 an effort that helped put Bill Clinton into the White House by splitting the rightwing vote \u2013 but Johnson insists he is in this to win a few states. He cites as central targets Wyoming, Montana, Nevada and Alaska \u2013 those western states with a history of frontier individualism that renders them open to the Libertarian message.</p> <p>He may be financially weak, but Johnson does have the benefit of coming after Ron Paul's energetic primary season. Paul's platform of small government, balanced budgets, an end to the war in Afghanistan and social freedoms such as marijuana legalization was essentially the same as Johnson's now.</p> <p>\"We may communicate things differently, but I don't see any difference between us in our policies,\" Johnson says.</p> <p>Paul has notably refrained from endorsing either Romney or Johnson \u2013 a failing that Johnson puts down to the fact that Paul's son, Rand, is a Republican senator. \"I think he's between a rock and a hard place,\" Johnson said.</p> <p>Still, Johnson says that since the end of the primaries his Libertarian campaign has felt a surge of energy as Paul's dedicated army of young followers has swung behind him. \"Now that Paul's out of the race, who represents all those folks? Is it Romney, or Obama or me? Well, clearly it's me. From our vantage point, there's been a massive movement of those people to our camp.\"</p> <p>That energy could be felt on Reddit, the internet community, where Johnson held an \"I am a\u2026\" chat session on Tuesday. He received more than 6,000 questions and comments and was second most popular item on the site.</p> <p>You can see why Johnson would intrigue and inspire young voters from the answers he gave to Reddit. Such as this one: \"I put the biggest threat to America as politicians who beat their chests over the threat of drugs, the threat of the illegal immigrant, the threat of terrorism, the threat of poor healthcare, all at a cost of bankrupting America\".</p> <p>Or this: \"As the Libertarian candidate, I am the only one talking about lowering welfare spending and warfare spending in the same sentence.\"</p> <p>The disproportionate threat that he poses to Romney is surprising, because in his policies he speaks at least as powerfully to progressive Americans as to conservatives. When he was governor of New Mexico between 1995 and 2003, he explored the possibility of legalizing marijuana in the state.</p> <p>His presidential slate includes support for gay marriage \u2013 \"what you do with your life is up to you, as long as you don't harm me\", he said \u2013 an attack on Obama for his record on civil liberties, and a pledge to bring the troops immediately out of Afghanistan.</p> <p>On the other side, while governor he famously used his veto 750 times \u2013 \"Governor Veto\" they called him \u2013 and he is committed to balancing the federal budget, overturning Obamacare and turning the health system over to the free market.</p> <p>\"The majority of Americans are fiscally responsible and socially accepting. I'm in that category of people \u2013 I think I'm representative of the majority of people in this country.</p> <p>\"Yet these people are let down by the two-party system. You've got Democrats that are supposed to be good on civil liberties but haven't been so good of late, and Republicans who are supposed to be good on dollars and cents but I'm not sure they have ever really been good at that. Combine them both, and arguably that's me.\"</p> <p>His big picture hope is that his presence in the race will open up political debate in the US, so that currently taboo subjects become acceptable in public discourse. \"I want to get enough votes to create a political safe ground,\" he said.</p> <p>\"So that Republicans think: gee! We can talk about having a truly balanced budget, and Democrats can actually talk about ending the wars and the drug war. That way we can change the world.\"</p>",
  "<p>The US appears to be emerging slowly from recession as young people leave home to look for work and historic increases in poverty start to slow, according to the latest census data. But the recovery is still leaving many Americans behind.</p> <p>The Census bureau released its 2011 American Community Survey (ACS), a wide-ranging look at the nation's economy and communities, on Thursday. The survey found some signs of hope for the jobs and housing markets that were hit so hard by the recession.</p> <p>About 12% of the nation's population, or 36.5 million people, moved to a new home in 2011, up from a record low of 11.6% the previous year. Moves among young adults aged 25 to 29 increased to 24.6% from a low of 24.1% in the previous year. The number of young adults living with their parents also fell to 13.6% from 14.2% in the previous year.</p> <p>The census found that median incomes dropped in 18 states, down from 35 states in 2010. In a potential blow to President Barack Obama, incomes dropped in Nevada, Ohio, North Carolina and Florida, all swing states in the 2012 election.</p> <p>William Frey, a demographer at Brookings Institution, said: \"On many levels we are continuing to slide in the wrong direction but just at a much slower pace.\" He said the combined punch on a national collapse in the housing market and the collapse in the jobs market had led a lot of young people in particular to \"put their lives on hold\" in the past few years.</p> <p>\"Now inter-state migration is picking up, it's still below 2007 levels, on a number of measures we are not moving down as quickly as we were,\" he said. \"It seems the worst is over.\"</p> <p>Despite some signs of recovery the census shows poverty remains a huge issue. About 15.9% of the US population had income below the poverty level in 2011, an increase from 15.3% in 2010. The number of people in poverty increased from 46.2 to 48.5 million during the same time period. While the poverty rate has now increased for four years in a row, the percentage increase between 2010 and 2011 was smaller than the change between 2008 and 2009, and between 2009 and 2010.</p> <p>The poorest metropolitan area was McAllen-Edinburgh-Mission in the Rio Grande valley of Texas. Some 37.7% of people in the area were living below the poverty line in 2011. The lowest poverty level was found in metropolitan Washington where 8.3% were in poverty.</p> <p>And while poverty slowed, food stamp use continued to climb. Food stamps have become an explosive political issue in the 2012 election. Earlier this month Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney used the food stamps issue to attack Obama's economic record.<br> \"When the president took office, 32 million people were on food stamps. And now that number is 15 million higher, almost 50% higher. Now, 47 million people on food stamps. You've got Americans falling into poverty under this president,\" he told Fox News.</p> <p>According to ACS 13% of US households received food stamps last year, the highest level on record and equal to one in eight families.</p>",
  "<p>Almost immediately after President Obama announced the killing of Osama bin Laden, top government officials, including then-CIA Director Leon Panetta and top terrorism adviser John Brennan, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/04/osama-bin-laden-killing-us-story-change\">made numerous false statements</a> about what took place. That included the claim that Bin Laden was killed after he engaged in a \"firefight\", that he <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/al-qaeda/8491108/Osama-bin-Laden-day-two-and-a-new-version-of-how-events-unfolded.html\">used his wife as a human shield</a> to protect himself, and that he was living in luxury in a $1m mansion.</p> <p>None of those claims, central to the story the White House told the world, turned out to be true. Bin Laden was unarmed and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/05/us/politics/05binladen.html?hp\">nobody in the house</a> where Bin Laden was found ever fired a single shot (a courier in an adjacent guest house was the only one to shoot, at the very beginning of the operation). Bin Laden never used his wife or anyone else as a shield. And the house was dilapidated, showed little sign of luxury, and was worth one-quarter of what it was claimed. <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/08/osama-bin-laden-killing-media\">Numerous other claims made by the administration</a> about the raid <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2011/05/debrief-bin-laden-raid-sea-burial-kill\">remain unanswered</a> because of its steadfast insistence on secrecy and non-disclosure (except when it <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2012/09/feds-hide-seal-name-given-to-hollywood-135685.html\">concerns Hollywood filmmakers</a>).</p> <p>Would it have mattered had the White House been truthful about the Bin Laden raid from the start? It would have undoubtedly made no difference for many people, who simply craved Osama bin Laden's death without regard to how it was done. But it certainly would have made a difference for at least some people around the world in terms of how they perceived of these actions and whether they approved \u2013 which is presumably why the White House was so eager to insist on these falsehoods and to ensure that the world's perception was shaped by them. (Please spare me the \"fog of war\" excuse: when the so-called \"fog of war\" causes the US government to make inaccurate claims that <em>undermine </em>its interests, rather than <em>bolster</em> them \u2013 as always happens \u2013 then that excuse will be plausible.)</p> <p>There's obviously an enormous difference between killing someone in a firefight and shooting him in cold blood while he's unarmed. The morning after the Bin Laden killing was announced, <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/05/02/bin_laden_12/\">I wrote</a> that although I'd have preferred he be captured and tried, \"if he in fact used force to resist capture, then the US military was entitled to use force against him, the way American police routinely do against suspects who use violence to resist capture.\" At least one legal scholar has <a href=\"http://opiniojuris.org/2012/08/29/author-of-no-easy-day-admits-to-committing-a-war-crime/\">changed his mind</a> about the legality of the killing, in the wake of evidence that Bin Laden was killed while lying on the ground, unarmed and severely wounded.</p> <p>But no matter. The White House's initial statements about what happened, false though they turned out to be, forever shaped perceptions of that event. Many people are unwilling to change their minds even in the wake of new evidence, while many others hear only of the initial claims made when news coverage is at its peak and never become aware of subsequent corrections. Combine that with the generalized \"Look Forward, Not Backward\" mentality <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K27oIJlAlA\">popularized by President Obama</a> \u2013 as embodied by <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/05/08/shut-up-and-move-on-kerry-says/\">John Kerry's \"shut up and move on\" decree</a> to those asking questions about what really happened in the Bin Laden raid \u2013 and those initial White House falsehoods did the trick.</p> <p>We now see exactly the same pattern emerging with the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya and the killing of the US ambassador. For a full week now, administration officials have <a href=\"http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/white-house-insists-benghazi-attack-was-not-pre-planned-was-all-about-a-movie/\">categorically insisted</a> that the prime, if not only, cause of the attack was spontaneous anger over the anti-Muhammad film, The Innocence of Muslims.</p> <p>Last week, White House spokesman Jay Carney <a href=\"http://pjmedia.com/tatler/2012/09/14/shocking-video-wh-spox-jay-carney-says-attacks-are-reaction-to-film-not-us-policy-and-were-not-pre-planned/\">insisted</a> that \"these protests, were in reaction to a video that had spread to the region.\" On Friday, <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/tv/carney-global-protests-directed-at-offensive-video-not-u-s-policy-or-the-obama-administration/\">he claimed</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"'This is a fairly volatile situation, and it is in response not to US policy, not to, obviously, the administration, not to the American people. It is in response to a video \u2013 a film \u2013 that we have judged to be reprehensive and disgusting. That in no way justifies any violent reaction to it. But this is not a case of protests directed at the United States, writ large, or at US policy. This is in response to a video that is offensive and \u2013 to Muslims.'\"</p> </blockquote> <p>On Sunday, UN ambassador Susan Rice, when asked about the impetus for the attack, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/09/ambassador-susan-rice-libya-attack-not-premeditated/\">said that</a> \"this began as, it was a spontaneous \u2013 not a premeditated \u2013 response to what had transpired in Cairo,\" and added: \"In Cairo, as you know, a few hours earlier, there was a violent protest that was undertaken in reaction to this very offensive video that was disseminated.\" In other interviews, she <a href=\"http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/09/17/un-amb-rice-libya-attack-was-spontaneous/\">insisted</a> that the Benghazi violence was a \"spontaneous\" reaction to the film.</p> <p>Predictably, and by design, most media accounts from the day after the Benghazi attack repeated the White House line as though it were fact, just as they did for the Bin Laden killing. Said <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/09/12/160989062/u-s-ambassador-to-libya-killed-in-attack\">NPR on 12 September</a>: \"The US ambassador to Libya and three other Americans were killed in an attack on the US consulate in Benghazi <em>by protesters angry over a film that ridiculed Islam's Prophet Muhammad</em>.\" The Daily Beast <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/09/12/riot-after-anti-islam-film-u-s-ambassador-to-libya-killed.html\">reported</a> that the ambassador \"died in a rocket attack on the embassy amid violent protests over a US-produced film deemed insulting to Islam.\" To date, numerous people <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/american-ambassador-killed-libya-sam-bacile-stevens-369785\">believe</a> \u2013 as though there were no dispute about it \u2013 that Muslims attacked the consulate and killed the US ambassador \"because they were angry about a film\".</p> <p>As it turns out, this claim is almost certainly false. And now, a week later, even the US government is acknowledging that, as <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2012/09/19/169102/us-official-calls-benghazi-consulate.html\">McClatchy reports this morning</a> [my emphasis]:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The Obama administration acknowledged for the first time Wednesday that last week's assault on the US consulate compound in Benghazi that left the US ambassador to Libya and three other Americans dead was a 'terrorist attack' apparently launched by local Islamic militants and foreigners linked to al-Qaida's leadership or regional allies.</p> <p>\"'I would say they were killed in the course of a terrorist attack,' said Matthew Olsen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center, told the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.</p> <p>\"It was the first time that a senior administration official had said the attack was <em>not the result of a demonstration over an anti-Islam video that has been cited as the spark for protests in dozens of countries over the past week</em> .'The picture that is emerging is one where a number of different individuals were involved,' Olsen said.\" [My emphasis]</p> </blockquote> <p>Worse, it isn't as though there had been no evidence of more accurate information before Wednesday. To the contrary, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chaos-at-the-consulate-as-militants-attack/2012/09/12/f92ad9d2-fcfe-11e1-8adc-499661afe377_story.html\">most evidence from the start</a> strongly suggested that the White House's claims \u2013 that this attack was motivated by anger over a film \u2013 were false. From McClatchy:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The head of Libya's interim government, key US lawmakers and experts contend that the attack appeared long-planned, complex and well-coordinated, matching descriptions given to McClatchy last week by the consulate's landlord and a wounded security guard, who denied there was a protest at the time and said the attackers carried the banner of Ansar al-Shariah, an Islamist militia.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Indeed, Libya's president has spent the week <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/politico-live/2012/09/libyan-president-no-doubt-consulate-attack-preplanned-135664.html\">publicly announcing</a> that there is \"no doubt\" the attack was planned well in advance and had nothing to do with the video.</p> <p>CBS News <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/report-never-anti-american-protest-benghazi-only-planned-attack_652761.html\">reported Thursday morning</a> that there was no anti-video protest at all at the consulate. Witnesses insist, said CBS, \"that there was <em>never</em> an anti-American protest outside of the consulate. Instead, they say, it came under planned attack.\" That, noted the network, \"is in direct contradiction to the administration's account of the incident.\" The report concluded: \"What's clear is that the public won't get a detailed account of what happened until after the election.\"</p> <p>The Obama White House's interest in spreading this falsehood is multi-fold and obvious:</p> <p>For one, the claim that this attack was just about anger over an anti-Muhammad video completely absolves the US government of any responsibility or even role in provoking the anti-American rage driving it. After all, if the violence that erupted in that region is driven only by anger over some independent film about Muhammad, then no rational person would blame the US government for it, and there could be no suggestion that its actions in the region \u2013 things like <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-16/nato-airstrike-kills-eight-women-civilians-in-afghanistan.html\">this</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/yemen/7806882/US-cluster-bombs-killed-35-women-and-children.html\">this</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/obama-to-abbas-u-s-will-veto-palestinian-statehood-bid-at-un-1.385932\">this</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/06/13/u_s_drones_deeply_unpopular_around_the_world/\">this</a> \u2013 had any role to play. </p> <p>The White House capitalized on the strong desire to believe this falsehood: it's deeply satisfying to point over there at those Muslims and scorn their primitive religious violence, while ignoring the massive amounts of violence to which one's own country continuously subjects them. It's much more fun and self-affirming to scoff: \"can you believe those Muslims are so primitive that they killed our ambassador over a film?\" than it is to acknowledge: \"our country and its allies have continually bombed, killed, invaded, and occupied their countries and supported their tyrants.\"</p> <p>It is always more enjoyable to scorn the acts of the Other Side than it is to acknowledge the bad acts of one's own. That's the self-loving mindset that enables the New York Times to write <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/20/opinion/the-united-states-and-the-muslim-world.html?\">an entire editorial today</a> purporting to analyze Muslim rage without once mentioning the numerous acts of American violence aimed at them (much of which the Times editorial page supports). Falsely claiming that the Benghazi attacks were about this film perfectly flattered those jingoistic prejudices.</p> <p>Then, there are the implications for the intervention in Libya, which Obama's defenders relentlessly tout as one of his great victories. But the fact that the Benghazi attack was likely premeditated and carried out by anti-American factions vindicates many of the criticisms of that intervention. Critics of the war in Libya warned that the US was siding with (and arming and empowering) violent extremists, including al-Qaida elements, that would eventually cause the US to claim it had to return to Libya to fight against them \u2013 just as its funding and arming of Saddam in Iraq and the mujahideen in Afghanistan subsequently justified new wars against those one-time allies. </p> <p>War critics also argued that the intervention would bring massive instability and suffering to the people of Libya; today,<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/libyas-central-government-exercises-little-authority-outside-capital/2012/09/19/d8f46610-0280-11e2-91e7-2962c74e7738_story.html\"> the Washington Post reports</a> that \u2013 just as the \"president of Afghanistan\" is really the mayor of Kabul and the \"Iraqi government\" long exercised sovereignty only in Baghdad's Green Zone \u2013 the central Libyan government exercises little authority outside of Tripoli. And intervention critics also warned that dropping bombs in a country and killing civilians, no matter how noble the intent supposedly is, would produce blowback in the form of those who would then want to attack the US.</p> <p>When the White House succeeded in falsely blaming the consulate attacks on anger over this video, all of those facts were obscured. The truth, now that it is emerging, underscores how unstable, lawless and dangerous Libya has become \u2013 far from the grand success story war proponents like to tell. As McClatchy noted in Thursday's report:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Libya remains plagued by armed groups nearly a year after the US-backed ouster of the late dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Yet the facility was primarily defended by local guards who may have been complicit \u2026</p> <p>\"Since the fall of Gaddafi last year, Libya's security has been dependent on a group of armed militias, including Ansar al-Shariah, that represent a wide variety of political strains and interests and remain heavily armed with weapons looted from Gaddafi storehouses. Interior Ministry forces and the Supreme Security Committee have been accused of complicity in recent attacks by Islamic fundamentalists on mosques and shrines affiliated with the moderate Sufi strain of Islam.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Then, there are the garden-variety political harms to the White House from the truth about these attacks. If the killing of the ambassador were premeditated and unrelated to the film, then it vests credibility in the criticism that the consulate should have been much better-protected, particularly on 9/11. And in general, the last thing a president running for re-election wants is an appearance that he is unable to protect America's diplomats from a terrorist group his supporters love to claim that he has heroically vanquished.</p> <p>The falsehood told by the White House \u2013 this was just a spontaneous attack prompted by this video that we could not have anticipated and had nothing to do with \u2013 fixed all of those problems. Critical attention was thus directed to Muslims (<em>what kind of people kill an ambassador over a film?</em>) and away from the White House and its policies. </p> <p>The independent journalist IF Stone <a href=\"http://www.ifstone.org/macpherson.php\">famously noted</a> that the number one rule of good journalism, even of good citizenship, is to remember that \"all governments lie.\" Yet, no matter how many times we see this axiom proven true, over and over, there is still a tendency, a desire, to believe that the US government's claims are truthful and reliable. </p> <p>The Obama administration's claims about the Benghazi attack are but the latest in <a href=\"http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2011/07/18/washingtons-untrue-claims-no-civilian-deaths-in-pakistan-drone-strikes/\">a long line of falsehoods</a> it has spouted on crucial issues, all in order to serve its interests and advance its agenda. Perhaps it is time to subject those claims to intense skepticism and to demand evidence before believing they are true.</p> <h2>Other matters</h2> <p>A former British army captain involved in co-ordinating drone attacks, James Jeffrey, has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/19/drone-warfare-deadly-civilian-toll\">an outstanding op-ed in the Guardian</a> explaining why drones are so odious and dangerous. I recommend it highly.</p> <p>Relating to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/16/conservatives-democrats-free-speech-muslims\">free speech debate</a> that has emerged over the last week, I have a question for those who insist that advocating or inciting violence is not and should not be included within the protections of free speech: should <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/07/fox-news-bob-beckel-calls_n_793467.html\">this statement</a> have led to an arrest? Relatedly: <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/21/opinion/21Ackerman.html\">many people believe</a> it was illegal for Obama to fight a war in Libya after Congress voted against the war's authorization, and many (including Obama) believe it would be illegal for the president to bomb Iran without congressional approval. Should advocacy of <em>those acts of illegal violence</em> be illegal and lead to arrest?</p> <p>The schedule of speaking events I'll be doing in late September and October has been slightly changed. All events are open to the public and <a href=\"http://ggsidedocs.blogspot.com.br/2012/09/late-septemberoctober-speaking-events.html\">event information is here</a>.</p>",
  "<h2>The big story</h2> <p>A violent reality check emerged this week: the moving image still has power to shock and disturb on a global scale. The crude anti-Islamic film Innocence of Muslims \u2013 allegedly a 13-minute trailer for a longer piece, which seems not to exist \u2013 showed that film, for better or worse, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2012/sep/17/innocence-of-muslims-demonstration-film\">does retain the power to influence world events</a>.</p> <p>The first most people became aware of the film was on (ironically<br>enough) the 11th anniversary of 9/11 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/11/egypt-protest\">when protestors in Egypt beseiged the US embassy</a>; already the story was a news event, rather than a film one.

  "<p>The Department for Transport (DfT) has launched a <a href=\"http://think.direct.gov.uk/cycling.html\">new campaign</a> for cyclist safety on the roads which, in summary, tells us: look, why can't everyone just get on?</p> <p>That's something of a parody, as despite its distinctly fluffy official title \u2013 \"Let's all look out for each other\" - the campaign from the DfT's <a href=\"http://think.direct.gov.uk/\">Think! road safety arm</a> has, at its heart, an eminently sensible message, and one I and many other on this blog have long argued.</p> <p>The DfT's point is that it's silly and divisive to discuss \"cyclists\" and \"drivers\" as if they're separate species. As the campaign points out, according to <a href=\"http://www.dft.gov.uk/statistics/releases/national-travel-survey-2010/\">the National Travel Survey</a> 80% of cyclists have a driving licence while one in five drivers ride a bike at least once a month.</p> <p>Stephen Hammond, the Tory MP who took over as road safety minister in the recent reshuffle from the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/bike-blog/2012/may/25/cycling-governed-dimwits\">reliably hapless Mike Penning</a>, has been wheeled out to provide equally sensible quotes to the effect that everyone had better get used to more cyclists being on the roads, what with the oft-cited \"Wiggins effect\" and all that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396438505\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/20/1348144767703/cyclead_460.jpg\" alt=\"DfT cycle safety poster\" width=\"460\" height=\"230\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The DfT's new safety poster</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>First, the praise: it's great that the DfT are trying to highlight cycle safety, and it's a very good idea to highlight the false divide between cyclists and drivers, which the poster released today does very well. On that point, when in this post I refer to \"drivers\" or \"cyclists\", read it as \"humans who happen to be driving/cycling at that moment and are not necessarily defined by it and use other forms of transport on other occasions\".</p> <p>Now, inevitably, the quibbles. Firstly, while a campaign using such tactics can hardly avoid dishing out advice to both drivers and cyclists \u2013 both are given six advice points each \u2013 the inescapable fact is that when it comes to incidents in which cyclists get seriously hurt, it is drivers who are more likely to be the problem. </p> <p>The joint advice, \"Look out for each other, especially when turning\", simply has that much more resonance when you're potentially on the receiving end of half a tonne of metal travelling at 30mph. </p> <p>This is borne out by statistics. The gold standard for this argument in the UK is a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/dec/15/cycling-bike-accidents-study\">2009 study by the DfT-affiliated Transport Research Laboratory</a>, which studied several years of accident data and concluded that in serious collisions involving adult cyclists, the driver was found to be solely responsible in about 60%-75% of cases, and riders solely at fault 17%-25% of the time.</p> <p>It's likely this is an underestimate of the true picture for two reasons. Firstly, those attributing fault were the police, who tend not to be overly pro-cyclist. Secondly, some of the accidents were fatal, meaning, of course, only the driver's account was heard.</p> <p>Whenever cycle safety gets mentioned debate tends to be dominated by complaints about cyclists running red lights. However antisocial or irritating this might be \u2013 I'd say very \u2013 it's not really a factor in this debate. The TRL statistics, which are to my knowledge by far the best UK evidence on this subject, found that where cyclists were seriously injured in collisions with other road users, them jumping lights or stop signs was a contributing factor in only 2% of cases.</p> <p>To return to the main subject, this is arguably a pointless quibble. You can't very well have a campaign highlighting the congruity of cyclists and drivers while pointing the blame finger mainly at one group. But it's worth mentioning, I think.</p> <p>My second worry is more specific, and was noticed first <a href=\"http://www.bikebiz.com/news/read/dft-unveils-road-safety-advice-that-swerves-away-from-the-highway-code\">by cycling journalist Carlton Reid on his BikeBiz website</a>. While the bulk of the advice to drivers in treating cyclists with courtesy is eminently sensible stuff, one line stands out. It reads: \"Give cyclists space \u2013 at least half a car's width. If there isn't sufficient space to pass, hold back.\"</p> <p>Half a car's width is really not very much. That most typical of cars, the Ford Focus, is 1.8m wide, excluding wing mirrors. A car passing 90cm from you at 40mph \u2013 let alone 60mph \u2013 doesn't sound like fun.</p> <p>As Reid points out it also seems to go against <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/TravelAndTransport/Highwaycode/DG_070314\">advice to drivers in the Highway Code</a>. This reads: \"Give motorcyclists, cyclists and horse riders at least as much room as you would when overtaking a car.\" The example photo shows a driver overtaking a cyclist with a gap of more or less a whole car's width.</p> <p>I've asked the DfT about this and they've promised to get back to me.</p> <p>But overall, let's give a muted cheer for the DfT. They've even gone to the trouble to get the heads of the RAC and AA to point out how many of their members also cycle, and the overall message really is long overdue: cyclists can't be dismissed or marginalised as an \"other\" group. Like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/18/mitt-romney-secret-video\">Mitt Romney's 47%</a>, we're not always the people you might think.</p> <h2>4.14pm update</h2> <p>The DfT, or rather a private PR company employed by them, has answered my query about the advice for drivers to leave \"at least half a car's width\" when overtaking cyclists, as mentioned above. They say:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It's important when you're driving to give other road users plenty of space. The Highway Code doesn't specify how much space as it's important that road users take all the circumstances into account when overtaking.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/chris-heaton-harris/28244\">Chris Heaton-Harris</a>, the Conservative MP for Daventry, is perhaps best known outside his constituency for his vocal stance against wind turbines.</p> <p>Earlier this year, he <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/feb/21/cameron-defends-wind-farm-mps\">organised a letter</a> signed by 101 fellow Conservative MPs - and a sprinkling from other parties - <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/parliament/2012/02/full-text-of-cut-the-subsidies-for-windfarms-letter-from-101-tory-mps-to-cameron-led-by-chhcalling.html\">calling on David Cameron</a> to end \"taxpayer subsidy, for inefficient and intermittent energy production that typifies on-shore wind turbines\".</p> <p>Heaton-Harris has since spoken at the first <a href=\"http://www.cumbriawindwatch.co.uk/blog/now-national-opposition-to-windfarms-conference-june-2012/\">National Opposition to Windfarms conference</a> held in June and continues to set out his stall on this issue frequently, both on <a href=\"http://daventrycalling.livejournal.com/tag/wind\">his blog</a> and in <a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com/uk/article/57125/chris_heaton_harris_no_more_new_windfarms_in_the_uk.html\">the media</a>.</p> <p>But now we learn of a new initiative organised by Heaton-Harris which suggests an attempt is being made to move anti-wind lobbying in the UK up a gear or two.</p> <p>I have been forwarded an email sent out by Heaton-Harris in August via a dedicated Gmail email address to, according to my source, \"companies and wealthy individuals\". Here's the email in full (minus personal information):</p> <blockquote> <p>From: Chris Heaton-Harris MP [mailto:trumpdinnerinlondon@gmail.com] <br>Sent: XX August 2012 </p> <p>Subject: An Invitation: Donald Trump Dinner in London - 6th October 2012<br> Dear XXXXXX, <br>Please forgive the \"cold call\" approach, but I was wondering if I could interest you in dinner?<br>I am the Member of Parliament for Daventry and was the person who put together the letter of over 100 MPs calling, so far unsuccessfully, for the Government to drastically reduce the subsidies available for wind turbines and I lead the campaign against these things in Parliament. You can find out more about me and this campaign here: <br>http://daventrycalling.livejournal.com/tag/wind <br>I have garnered a great deal of support for the campaign and one of my bigger supporters has kindly said he would speak at a big dinner event for me to raise money for my continuing campaigning in this area. He is a famous and controversial businessman who is the \"Boss\" in the American version of \"The Apprentice\" and was a candidate to be Republican Nominee to be President of the United States. My speaker on the evening is Donald Trump. <br>If all goes to plan, the dinner will be on 6th October and tickets are \u00a3275 each with tables for ten available for \u00a32,500.<br>I was hoping that you or your company might be interested in taking a table at the dinner or even sponsoring the event. I am aiming to get all sponsorship sorted by the end of this week, so that we can then start to sell the tickets with appropriate branding on them.<br>If you are interested, please give me a call on my mobile (XXXXXXXX) or reply to this e-mail and I will send you more details. If not, please forgive me for the intrusion.<br>Yours,<br>Chris<br>Chris Heaton-Harris MP.<br>Conservative Member of Parliament for Daventry.<br> <br>Mobile: XXXXXXXXX<br>Website: www.heatonharris.com</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, on 8 September, a slightly different invitation appeared on the <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/eastmids.conservatives/posts/469217776446016\">East Midlands Conservative's Facebook page</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>An invitation from Chris Heaton-Harris MP - dinner with Donald Trump</p> <p>Dear Fellow Conservative,</p> <p>I am writing to tell you about an exciting and very rare dinner opportunity that will take place on Saturday 6th October 2012. The well known Republican and business tycoon, Donald Trump, has very kindly agreed to take time out of his busy diary and fly over from New York to support my campaign against onshore wind turbines.</p> <p>Like many Conservative Party members, Mr Trump, who owns property in Aberdeen, holds very strong views on the inefficiencies of wind energy. At the dinner on 6th October Mr Trump will warn guests as to the very real threat from turbines to Britain's landscape and tourism industry, with the aim of raising public awareness.</p> <p>Obviously, with this dinner being less than a month before the Presidential Election in the United States, Mr Trump will talk about other political newsworthy topics and take a handful of questions.</p> <p>In order to accommodate Mr Trump's busy diary, the dinner is being held in London, at the Emirates Stadium, which is home to Arsenal Football Club.<br>Dinner will start with a champagne reception, followed by a 4 course meal. Tickets are \u00a3275 each.</p> <p>Tickets can be purchased via Daventry Conservative Association by phoning 01604 859721, or by responding to this email. Obviously, to get the commission, please ask your members to name your Association when ordering tickets.</p> <p>Yours faithfully,</p> <p>Chris<br>Chris Heaton-Harris MP.</p> </blockquote> <p>Intrigued to know how many people might be at the dinner, I called the events team at Arsenal's <a href=\"http://www.arsenal.com/emirates-stadium\">Emirates Stadium</a> in London. A spokeswoman told me that the <a href=\"http://www.venuedirectory.com/RoomView.aspx?roomid=19454&amp;venueid=6513\">Royal Oak suite</a> had been booked, which can seat 500 guests for dinner.</p> <p>But then she added: \"It's been cancelled, though, due to lack of interest. <a href=\"http://www.daventryconservatives.com/\">Daventry Conservatives</a> never returned the contract to us that we'd sent out to them.\"</p> <p>I then rang Daventry Conservatives to confirm that the dinner had been cancelled. Yes, they said, \"due to poor ticket sales\".</p> <p>So, even with the star attraction of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> (who \u2013 lest we forget \u2013 is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jul/10/donald-trump-100m-golf-course\">opposed to offshore turbines</a> being built within eyesight of his \u00a3100m luxury hotel development in Aberdeenshire), Heaton-Harris couldn't get his anti-wind fundraiser off the ground due to \"lack of interest\"? What does this tell us \u2013 if anything \u2013 about the real strength and depth of the highly vocal, media-supported anti-wind campaign in the UK? After all, when DECC published its latest public attitude tracker survey (<a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/assets/decc/11/stats/6410-decc-public-att-track-surv-wave2-summary.pdf\">pdf</a>) this week, it showed that only 12% of those surveyed are against onshore wind power (with 4% \"strongly opposed\") compared to 66% who support it.</p> <p>I called Heaton-Harris to get his account of the cancellation. He said:</p> <blockquote> <p>No, we didn't sell enough tickets. But we only had two weeks to do it. We've postponed it, rather than cancel it. We are now going to try and hold it in February or March, depending on Mr Trump's diary. He's very keen to help us. It is a party political fundraiser for Daventry Conservatives to help us continue with our [anti-wind] campaigning. So any funds raised will all be officially declared.</p> </blockquote> <p>If he does pull it off and sell out the 500-seat Royal Oak suite at the Emirates Stadium that will swell his local party office's coffers by \u00a3137,500, less costs. It's certainly going to be one to watch: not only to see if he fills up the room, but also which \"companies and wealthy individuals\" cough up the cash. Heaton-Harris told me he already has \"two people\" interested in sponsoring the event.</p>",
  "<p>China's manufacturing sector remained in recession territory for the 11th month in a row. The prospects for industry in the eurozone are getting worse. Despite Mitt Romney's gaffe-strewn campaign, America's faltering economy could yet deprive Barack Obama of four more years in the White House.</p> <p>For policymakers, these echoes of late 2008 are clearly worrying. Back then, the collapse of Lehman Brothers led to a collapse in industrial production and a sharp contraction in world trade. The current slowdown is nowhere near as severe as that suffered in the winter of 2008-09 but is evidence of just how hard it is to shake off the effects of the financial crisis.</p> <p>There are three big and interlocking problems. The first is Europe, where repeated application of sticking plaster cannot disguise the fact that economic weakness is spreading from the periphery to the core. The second problem is that little progress has been made in tackling the global imbalances that created the conditions for the crash of 2007. China's current account surplus is well down on its pre-crisis peak, but the growing trade tensions between Washington and Beijing are testimony to the slow pace of rebalancing.</p> <p>Finally, central banks and finance ministries have already used up large amounts of their available ammunition. China has started to ease policy, cutting the cost of borrowing and giving the green light to local infrastructure projects. But the stimulus is not going to be on anything like the scale seen in 2009-10. The US has just announced its third tranche of quantitative easing while the Bank of England appears to be gearing up for a fifth dose of asset purchasing. Public finances in the west are deep in the red.</p> <p>It is clear what ought to happen. A re-elected president Obama should sit down in the new year with China's new premier, Xi Jinping, and Germany's Angela Merkel to come up with a blueprint for global rebalancing and global reflation. That would involve a revaluation of the yuan and a commitment to stronger domestic demand growth in Germany.</p> <p>The chances of this happening, though, are slim \u2013 even assuming it is Obama rather than the more hawkish Romney sitting in the White House next year. The slowing of the global economy is making policymakers more inward-looking and defensive, with just about every country trying to export its way back to prosperity. Beijing's policy easing should be enough to prevent any further weakening in the economy, and there were signs from Thursday's purchasing managers' index that the manufacturing sector is past the worst. But the world economy looks a long way from returning to sustained, robust growth and the slowdown of 2012 looks set to continue well into 2013.</p>",
  "<p>Before the conventions, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/24/why-next-two-weeks-make-break-romney-ryan\">I wrote</a> that \"If Obama still leads by 1.5 points once the convention dust has settled, it's difficult for me to envisage how Obama will lose.\" We are now past the conventions and President Obama still leads.</p> <p>Any individual national poll is confusing, but the aggregate is a fairly clear Obama edge. Nine pollsters have conducted a survey with a median field date at least a week after the Democratic National Convention. President Obama has led in all of their surveys except for Rasmussen's. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396404499\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/19/1348092223646/nationalpolls_220.jpg\" alt=\"National polls, 2012\" width=\"220\" height=\"164\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The median result is Obama ahead by 4 percentage points. You might note that the Gallup and YouGov results are among registered voters. Even when we shave 2.5 points off of Obama's margin for a \"likely voter\" adjustment, the median result is still Obama, by 3 percentage points. </p> <p>For those who don't like doing the math, a 3-point lead is actually larger than the 1.5-point lead Obama had going into the conventions. The fact that I'm looking only at data one week (or later, for the RNC) after the conventions suggests to me that Obama didn't receive merely a momentary bump but may have gotten the campaign equivalent of a shot of cortisone that will last the rest of the campaign.</p> <p>The factors underlying this campaign have also not shifted in Romney's direction, but rather in Obama's. In May, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/may/16/2012-race-obama-approvals-romneys-favorables\">I wrote</a> that \"the 2012 race comes down to Obama's approvals v Romney's favorables\". Take a look at <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/mitt-romney-favorability\">this chart</a> of Romney's favorability ratings since 1 June. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396404500\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/19/1348092255901/favorables_460.jpg\" alt=\"Favorables 2012\" width=\"460\" height=\"228\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>What you see is steadiness or even a slight dip in favorables since the conventions. The absolute numbers are skewed because of different sample populations (likely voters v registered voters v adults), yet the trend is undeniable. Mitt Romney's main electoral failing has been a lack of favorability, and the conventions did nothing to change this factor. </p> <p>Meanwhile, President Obama's achilles heel had been his low job approval rating. A <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/obama-job-approval\">chart</a> of his approvals since the conventions shows a positive trend.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396404501\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/19/1348092316308/approvals_460.jpg\" alt=\"Approvals 2012\" width=\"460\" height=\"229\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>For the first time in almost a year and a half, Obama's approval is greater than his disapproval in the HuffPollster approval chart. Remember that Obama managed to lead this race when his approval still trailed his disapproval in the HuffPollster chart. As you might expect, his lead has increased, given the rise in his approvals. </p> <p>The state level data is less clear, but we still can make some keen observations. The baseline electoral college estimate looks like this:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396404502\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/19/1348092368577/electoralmap_460.jpg\" alt=\"Electoral map 2012\" width=\"460\" height=\"331\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>There isn't an analyst in the world who thinks that Barack Obama isn't leading in Ohio right now. It is also fairly clear that Obama's Ohio lead is wider than his national margin. The weighted <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2012-ohio-president-romney-vs-obama\">HuffPollster aggregate</a>, which accounts for house effects and weights state level to regional and national estimates, has Obama running 1.3 points ahead of his national percentage in Ohio. Romney's own political director <a href=\"http://townhall.com/columnists/guybenson/2012/09/18/inside_team_romneys_plans_to_win/page/full/\">admits</a> that it's not an \"easy state\".</p> <p>If Obama wins Ohio, he's at 255 electoral votes. A win in Florida puts him in the White House for a second term. Let's, for argument's sake, give Romney Florida, even though <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2012-florida-president-romney-vs-obama\">he trails</a> there. We'll also afford him <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2012-north-carolina-president-romney-vs-obama\">North Carolina</a>, where he does hold a small advantage. Romney then <em>must</em> take <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2012-colorado-president-romney-vs-obama\">Colorado</a> and <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2012-iowa-president-romney-vs-obama\">Iowa</a>. Both are states where he seems to be running at least equal to his national numbers, if not somewhat ahead. Still, he is probably losing to Obama in both.</p> <p>Even after giving Romney all these states where he isn't ahead, he is still only at 250 electoral votes. His deficit in <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2012-virginia-president-romney-vs-obama\">Virginia</a> is almost certainly greater than his nationwide hole. A loss in Virginia means he's got to take <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2012-new-hampshire-president-romney-vs-obama\">New Hampshire</a>, <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2012-nevada-president-romney-vs-obama\">Nevada</a>, and <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2012-wisconsin-president-romney-vs-obama\">Wisconsin</a>. The issue here is that there hasn't been a poll with Romney ahead in Nevada in the last year and a half. Likewise, Wisconsin also seems to be slipping from Romney's grip, with two polls out Wednesday pegging him down by at least 6 points. Only New Hampshire may be trending towards Romney.</p> <p>The bottom line is that the state level isn't any better than the national picture for Romney. In fact, you can argue that it is considerably worse. </p> <p>Some Romney supporters might argue that this election is still about the economy and the economy stinks \u2013 bad for the incumbent. The truth is that while the economy may not be booming, it is almost certainly good enough to get an incumbent re-elected. Econometric models <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/13/mitt-romney-barack-obama-economy\">projecting</a> the election have a 50:50 split. That should give Romney hope for a comeback, but it definitely doesn't guarantee one. John Sides makes a <a href=\"http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/09/11/here-we-go-again/\">powerful argument</a> that the economy, in fact, favors Obama. That's probably why you've seen Obama <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/inside-politics/2012/sep/19/poll-romney-losing-his-edge-economy/\">catching up</a> to Romney on the question of who can best manage the economy. </p> <p>But what about a game-changing event? <a href=\"http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/09/17/mitt-romney-and-that-47/\">Gaffes</a> like Romney's 47% remarks have shown no ability to move the polls. <a href=\"http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/septemberoctober_2012/ten_miles_square/do_presidential_debates_really039413.php\">Debates</a>, as John Sides points out, have historically almost never made a difference. A foreign policy fiasco would almost certainly result in a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rally_'round_the_flag_effect\">rally around the leader</a> effect, a la Carter in 1980, before the incumbent gets blamed. There isn't enough time for the \"blame\" part of the equation to occur before the election. </p> <p>That's why polls a few weeks <a href=\"http://politicalwire.com/archives/2012/09/17/the_timeline_of_presidential_elections.html\">after the conventions</a> are usually <a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2011-09-30-Blumenthal-wlezieneriksonfig5.6.png\">quite accurate</a> in predicting the result. The economy is usually factored in by voters at this time, and there isn't a campaign event that can alter the playing field fast enough.</p> <p>Simply put, there hasn't been a single candidate to come back after trailing by 3 points this late in the campaign in the past 60 years. </p> <p>When I look the current polling data and put it into this historical context, I just don't see a Romney victory. It's not that it <em>can't</em> happen; it's just that 3 points is a good lead in a race that has hasn't shifted easily. Indeed, I wouldn't be surprised if Obama's 3-point lead eventually shrank back to the pre-convention numbers that were so stable for so long. That would fit a <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/22/do-presidential-polls-break-toward-challengers/\">historical pattern</a> of tightening before an election. But this race is no toss-up: it now leans pretty hard in Obama's direction.</p>",

In a released broadcast he conceded: \"There is no easy way to say this.\"</p> <p>It was stressed that Clegg was apologising for making the pledge to the National Union of Students before the election not to raise tuition fees, but not for the eventual decision by the coalition to lift the cap on fees to \u00a39,000.</p> <p>The deputy prime minister made the decision to confess in an attempt to win back a hearing from a public that he feels, at least until recently, had tuned him out because of its unrelenting anger over the broken tuition fee pledge.</p> <p>Some of his advisers urged him against the apology, saying it would be taken as a sign of weakness, or merely disinterring an issue best left buried, but Clegg was convinced the confession was necessary after a summer tour of town hall meetings left him persuaded that the issue of the broken pledge would simply not go away, and was corroding trust.</p> <p>In the broadcast he said: \"It was a pledge made with the best of intentions \u2013 but we should not have made a promise we were not absolutely sure we could deliver. I shouldn't have committed to a policy that was so expensive when there was no money around. Not least when the most likely way we would end up in government was in coalition with Labour or the Conservatives who were both committed to put fees up.\"</p> <p>Promising to learn from his mistakes, he vowed: \"I will never again make a pledge unless as a party we are absolutely clear about how we can keep it.\"</p> <p>Clegg believes that with another coalition possible after the 2015 election, all three parties must be clearer about pledges that would survive coalition negotiations. He is aware some of the electorate will take his apology as a sign of vulnerability or the act of a desperate man at a time when his personal poll ratings are plumbing new depths, but he believes others will find his honesty refreshing. Clegg insists he will take his party into the next election and believes this move will help clear the path.</p> <p>In an admission of how much damage he has suffered, he said he accepted his apology \"won't be enough for everyone. But I owe it to you to be upfront about it. And I don't believe it should cast a shadow over everything else the Liberal Democrats are achieving in government. When we are wrong we hold our hands up. But when we are right we hold our heads up too.\"</p> <p>Clegg's aides said he had been wanting to make this full apology for a long time, but had only sensed in the past few months that the electorate might be in a mood to listen. He did not tell his coalition partners of his plan, but did consult the business secretary, Vince Cable, the architect of the tuition fees policy.</p> <p>As Clegg was touring the country in April 2010 signing the NUS promise not to increase tuition fees, his coalition negotiating team was planning to abandon the pledge.</p> <p>Cable on BBC Newsnight conceded he had been told before the election that the student fees pledge was unaffordable and said he had been sceptical about its affordability. \"It was an unwise commitment to have been made. We are collectively responsible. We all participated.\"</p> <p>He insisted it was not a stunt: \"It was part of a genuinely felt wish to assist the student population. We weren't able to carry through with it, but it was certainly deeper than a stunt.\"</p> <p>Fellow Lib Dem David Laws said he supported Clegg's apology.</p> <p>\"Yes, of course I do, every Liberal Democrat MP has a collective responsibility, this was a decision not just by Nick Clegg and Vince Cable but by all of us in the Liberal Democrat party.\"</p> <p>Laws, a close ally of Clegg who came back into government as schools minister this month after two years on the backbenches, denied that Clegg's making of a promise he knew he couldn't keep to win favour with his party represented a failure of leadership.</p> <p>He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: \"I don't think that's fair. He took on the party and told them what they didn't want to hear, which was that the pledge of abolishing tuition fees overnight was not affordable and we'd have to do it over two parliaments.</p> <p>\"He now regrets, and I now regret, and Vince Cable now regrets, that we didn't go further to point out how tough this would be, and we didn't make clearer in our manifesto the risk, given the fact that the other parties were committed to precisely the opposite policy.</p> <p>\"Both of them wanted to increase fees and that's why it would have been very difficult in coalition to deliver this policy.\"</p> <p>An Ipsos/Mori poll showed satisfaction with Clegg has fallen from 31% to 23% in the last month, while dissatisfaction rose from 58% to 66%. This gives him his worst ever net satisfaction rating, -43. He even has a negative net personal rating of -8 among Liberal Democrat voters at the 2010 election. By contrast David Cameron and Ed Miliband rate at +42 and +21 respectively with their voters.</p> <p>Shabina Mahmood, the shadow higher education minister, said: \"Clegg's apology for promising not to raise fees, but not for \u00a39,000 fees themselves, is too little too late for the students starting this week.\"</p> <p>Tom Wood, chair of Liberal Youth, said: \"The broken fees pledge was a cloud hanging over Liberal Youth, frustrating our efforts to highlight other important issues for young people. That cloud is now cleared.\"</p> <p>Liam Burns, the NUS president, said: \"Nick Clegg should be apologising to voters for breaking his pledge, not for making it in the first place.\"</p>",
  "<p>If Angela Merkel wins next year's elections, she will become Germany's second-longest-serving postwar chancellor after Helmut Kohl \u2013 and be heading towards becoming Europe's longest-serving female head of government, eclipsing Margaret Thatcher.</p> <p>Such a political triumph is not about to get any easier. Merkel could yet fall foul of the euroszone turmoil. And then there is also the fact that Germany's political landscape has become more fragmented than at any time since the end of the second world war.</p> <p>\"Germany is not becoming ungovernable, but it's definitely becoming harder to form governments,\" said Hans Kundnani, a Germany analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations.</p> <p>Five to six parties have been competing for seats in the Bundestag since East and West Germany were reunited in 1990, including the Christian Democrats; their Bavarian sister party, the CSU; the pro-business FDP; the Greens; and the PDS or Party of Democratic Socialism \u2013 later to become Die Linke, (the Left). Next year, a new force will try to join the mix, an upstart party called the Pirates, which has made striking gains in four state elections so far.</p> <p>The Freie W\u00e4hler, (free voters), a campaign group of Eurosceptic, anti-bailout campaigners is also trying to establish itself and while it has yet to enjoy the sort of poll successes of the Pirates, it is being tipped as a future player on the political scene, particularly if anti-European sentiment increases.</p> <p>\"There is a very considerable potential for dissatisfaction in Germany right now,\" said Gunnar Beck, a German reader in EU law at the School of Oriental and African Studies (Soas), University of London.</p> <p>The quiet revolution in German politics is being prepared in a small office space in Berlin's Mitte district, where the Pirates' head, Bernd Schl\u00f6mer, a criminologist by training, sits at a table surrounded by crates of Club-Mate energy drinks and shelves of computer equipment.</p> <p>\"There is a mood change taking place in Germany,\" he said. \"The other parties are suffering from the fact that they are not seen as innovative forces and we're benefiting from that.\"</p> <p>Germans, he said, want to be \"far more involved\" in the decision-making process. Though he admitted the difficulty faced by his party, whose main campaign issue is to push for more internet freedom, of \"trying to develop a political style from nothing\".</p> <p>He said it is unfair to criticise the party for its vague stance on major issues. It is developing them, he said, arguing that other more established parties are often no clearer.</p> <p>\"We have no answers to the euro crisis, but neither do the other parties.\"</p> <p>Yet just as his party is benefiting from the crisis drawing in an anti-establishment crowd, so the crisis should be seen as an opportunity.</p> <p>\"We should use the crisis to redefine Europe, to redefine Germany's political landscape. This crisis is a chance,\" he said, adding something you do not expect to hear from the mouth of a politician. \"My party's greatest ambition would be to become obsolete because everyone else copied us.\"</p> <p>The question is whether the party will be strong enough to change the system or whether, as many analysts rather suspect, it will become subsumed by it.</p> <p>\"The more the Pirates are involved in the parliamentary process, the more they'll have to play within the rules,\" said Gerd Languth, professor of political science at the University of Bonn. \"It cannot be ruled out that they'll enter the Bundestag, but there's still quite a lot of doubt.\"</p> <p>While the three-party traffic-light coalition (Greens, Liberals, SPD) is a possibility, or even a minority government, most experts predict a return to the grand coalition between the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats last seen in 2005. While at the outset it can seem unwieldy, general consensus seems to be that it can work more effectively in challenging times.</p> <p>While branding German voters highly traditionalist, and preferring to vote for a party rather than a personality, Languth, said that Merkel's own personality ratings had been so consistently high that \"it's hard to imagine that the Merkel factor won't play a role\" in the election outcome.</p> <p>He said there was no sign that Germany was in danger of becoming ungovernable. \"Because Germany's system is representative that means that six or more parties can still get into the Bundestag, which in theory might lead to a lack of stability, but it is also Germany's democratic advantage, above, say, Great Britain.\"</p> <p>The German system is also supported by the high degree to which Germans desire political consensus, he added. \"It's amazing how consensus-oriented the Germans are, in part due to the collective trauma of the 1920s and 30s. Add to that the fact they're also overwhelmingly pro-European and that simply increases the sense of consensus, which say, is greater than the will to topple Merkel.\"</p> <p>Many are fearful though of that consensus and its potentially stultifying consequences. The leftwing political commentator <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/feb/21/angela-merkel-hamburg-christian-democrats-germany\" title=\"\">Jakob Augstein</a> has said a Grand Coalition between the CDU and SPD would cause a \"German paralysis\".</p> <p>\"A Grand Coalition is not a symbol of our democracy but of a long and lingering illness ... It would feel like Germans had given up on their political system ... It amounts to a resignation. A silence,\" he recently commented.</p> <p>Kundnani said that what's happened in Germany is merely a reflection on what's happened elsewhere. \"Politics has become less tribal,\" he said. In other words, people are no longer voting for the same party for life and your party affiliations no longer determine the job you do.</p> <p>\"The big game-changer was the arrival of Die Linke, as a belated consequence of German unification, which led to the fragmentation of German politics and make it harder to have a two-party coalition,\" he said. \"When the Grand Coalition was formed in 2005 it was the only option left \u2013 largely because the Linke had eaten into the SPD vote so much that they could no longer head a government. Many said that there would be no more two-party coalitions, but it seems we're back to that situation.\"</p> <p>Constanze Stelzenm\u00fcller, a senior transatlantic fellow with the <a href=\"http://www.gmfus.org/\" title=\"\">German Marshall Fund</a> in Berlin, said she did not believe a Grand Coalition would be damaging to Germany: \"Though we know from experience it could be boring and painful, and that boredom and pain will be more or less depending on who the challenger is.\" Despite their current poor standing in the polls, neither would she exclude, she said, the scenario of a Social Democrat chancellor in the event of an economic downturn.</p> <p>What makes Germany complicated to govern is the federal parliamentary democracy structure put in place by the allies after the second world war \u2013 consisting of the two-chamber legislature, the Bundestag and the Bundesrat, plus the constitutional court that in effect polices it \u2013 which aimed to make the political landscape as inclusive as possible, said Wolfgang Nowak, director of Deutsche Bank's <a href=\"http://www.alfred-herrhausen-gesellschaft.de/en/\" title=\"\">Alfred Herrhausen Society</a> and a former adviser to the Social Democrat chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der.</p> <p>\"The German system works on the basis that it's better to have the opposition in parliament than on the street,\" he said. \"Whether that makes sense or not is another question, but what we have is a very complex electoral system which tries to bind all currents into one parliament. The executive in Germany is very, very tightly controlled. Is Germany weakened by that? Yes, of course. But is Britain stronger with a two-party government?\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15737185\" title=\"\">David McAllister</a>, the CDU prime minister of Lower Saxony, said stability was a relative concept. \"If you look at other countries with a proportional representation system, the German political system has been very stable over the last 65 to 70 years. Compare it to Italy, where political parties like the Christian Democrats have completely disappeared, or you look at the Netherlands or Denmark, it's quite clear that Germany has quite a stable system. And I'm not sure we will have a six-party system in the long term \u2013 the Linke seem to have reached their peak, and the Pirates? Well, they just have to grow up and start working on their programme if they want to have a chance but in the meantime they've taught us that we've got to explain more about what we're doing at all stages of the political process.\"</p>",
  "<p>It was, Angela Merkel reflects, the most galling mistake of her childhood. Not a lie or a betrayal, some malicious gossip or a fistfight but the moment in which the young girl from East Germany crawled into the resinous hollow of a tree wearing a new tracksuit sent to her from the West.</p> <p>The anecdote speaks volumes about a dutiful, conscientious, slightly awkward woman who, though pre-eminent in Germany for seven years, is still a relative enigma to her compatriots. It was a response to an array of questions put to her by S\u00fcddeutsche magazine as part of a broader inquiry: \"Who is this person who is governing our country?\"</p> <p>The answer: a woman who regrets not being able to go shopping without being recognised; who would most like to have supper with Vicente del Bosque, the manager of the Spanish football team; who powers down through hiking, cooking or laughing and whose biggest fear is, no, not the collapse of the euro, but getting caught unprotected in a thunderstorm.</p> <p>A man who knows Merkel better than most and admits to being referred to as her \"little pet\" is David McAllister, 41, an up-and-coming member of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and prime minister of Lower Saxony who has been tipped as a future chancellor (and also happens to be half Scottish). He puts her success down to her commonality. \"There's no ballyhoo with her,\" he says. \"She's very direct and down to earth. What Germans love is they see her on Friday in Brussels with Hollande, Obama, Cameron, whoever, and then they see in their newspaper the next day how directly after that she went shopping for her supper in the supermarket. The photograph of that wasn't fixed. Everyone knows that that's the way she is.\"</p> <p>He also credits her with modernising the CDU, a party whose members \u2013 typically Catholic, male, western, family-oriented \u2013 she has led as a Lutheran, eastern, childless woman. \"I think there are hundreds of thousands of people in this country who now vote for the CDU who wouldn't have done before her,\" McAllister added. He said that while well aware that Germans tend to vote for a party rather than a personality, the CDU is desperately trying to persuade people \"if you want Angela Merkel you've got to vote for the CDU,\" in recognition of how strong the Merkel factor is.</p> <p>Others are less charitable. The academic and former adviser to Helmut Kohl Gertrud H\u00f6hler, describes her as furtive, dangerous and a threat to Europe in her new book, The Godmother: How Angela Merkel Is Reshaping Germany, in which she coins the phrase \"System M\" to describe Merkel's modus operandi. \"For years, the press has concentrated on the question as to whether she governs well, or badly, or perhaps not at all,\" said H\u00f6hler. \"In reality, Merkel has developed an autocratic system,\" she said, and has \"already installed an autocratic regime\".</p> <p>She accuses Merkel of ruining the euro and undermining the political careers of many leading men in the CDU. She even mentions her in the same breath as German dictators of the last century and goes so far as to suggest her strict Lutheran pastor father's decision to bring her up in the authoritarian confines of the communist East, where Merkel moved with her family when she was just weeks old, was an extension of his deep desire to control her. But H\u00f6hler's book cuts against the grain of popular opinion, which still strongly favours Merkel. According to the latest poll her popularity rating is 61%, making her Germany's most popular politician.</p> <p>Wolfgang Nowak, director of Deutsche Bank's Alfred Herrhausen Society and a former adviser to the SPD chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der said the reason many people, including H\u00f6hler, were suspicious of Merkel was precisely because she kept so much to herself. \"The reason there's a System M is because it's the first time in German politics that a chancellor's office sticks so tightly together so that nothing is leaked. Merkel talks to just a very small, tight, trusted circle and those who are not in that circle are often envious or offended,\" he said.</p> <p>\"There's also the theory,\" said Constanze Stelzenm\u00fcller of the German Marshall Fund \"that Merkel is the kind of person that decides the more you say and the more you write, the more these things can be held against you and the less said the better, the more done the better. I'd guess her motto was: 'Let's get more done' and that strikes me as entirely sensible. Particularly in a media age, that's a sign of strength.\"</p> <p>Nowak added it is indeed true, as Hohler writes, that many men who once held big positions in the party are now gone, \"but not because Merkel killed them off, rather, they were simply unmasked for what they were \u2013 CDU career politicians, puppets or fraudsters\".</p> <p>Gunnar Beck, a reader in law from the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies, is rather more sceptical, saying that Merkel is only held in such high regard because those around her don't make the grade. He is critical of her diplomatic skills, as well as her judgment of character. \"By comparison to a rather unfortunate line of politicians who have been exposed for irregularities of various kinds, (including the former president and former defence minister) she appears to be the paragon of virtue and that's noticed by the electorate, albeit in the context of a low general standard. She's entirely above criticism in her personal life and work ethic, but you've got to put it into perspective. While she's a very good domestic political operator she is helpless abroad and she's also a spectacularly bad judge of character,\" he says, citing her promotion of many who have since fallen (including the president, defence minister and Nicolas Sarkozy) and others who have not, including the European Central Bank's president, Mario Draghi, and Jorg Asmussen, an executive board member of the ECB. Beck is also wary of the idea that Merkel has a sophisticated plan. \"She is a superbly shrewd party and domestic politician but has been repeatedly outmanoeuvred by Draghi, Monti, Hollande and others. There is no sign that she has a masterplan regarding the euro.\"</p> <p>Among those critical of Merkel's lack of vision is Hans Kundnani, a Germany analyst and editorial director at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \"What's needed now is someone who can talk up the benefits of the single currency, of Germany's role in the euro narrative, including the fact that it bears responsibility for this flawed currency, rather than saying: 'we're the victims of it,'\" he said. \"She's not particularly visionary or bold.\"</p> <p>Gerd Languth, a political analyst and Merkel biographer, said this was precisely what Germans liked about her. \"She is extremely pragmatic, and non-ideological, like most Germans are.\" She had, he said, been strengthened by the knowledge that despite criticism from outside Germany over her euro policies, the support for her within was stronger than ever. \"She notices that the more she's attacked from outside, the more the solidarity towards her within Germany grows,\" he said. \"Germans don't know what she wants, but the trust in her is unshakeable, and if the ship cants, she's the one they want to be at the helm.\"</p> <p>While there is at this stage, a year before a general election, quite a degree of expectation that Merkel will be re-elected, much is still at stake, not least, if the German economy takes a dive or the euro plunges into more misery, which could see the tide of popular opinion turning against her. Despite the growing disgruntlement towards her among Christian Democrats, Languth said he found it hard \"to imagine a CDU governing without Merkel if they're standing high in the polls\".</p> <p>What he is sure about though is that if Merkel were not re-elected \"she'd disappear from politics altogether\". Asked what he thought she would do, he said that unlike her predecessor and close friend of Putin, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, \"she would not go to work for Gazprom\".</p> <p><em>The final paragraph of this article was changed on Thursday, September 20 to read \"close friend\" of Putin rather than \"close fiend\". The error was introduced during the editing process</em></p>",

  "<p>As health secretary Jeremy Hunt struggles to get to grips with his new brief, it will become increasingly clear to him that the big issue he faces is shutting services. Lots of them.</p> <p>The evidence supporting the case for widespread reconfiguration of services keeps piling up. Just in the last few days Dr Hilary Cass, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, used <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/04/medicine-inefficient-way-rcpch-leader\" title=\"\">a fascinating interview with the Guardian's Denis Campbell</a> to point out that it simply isn't safe, let alone financially viable, to maintain the current 218 children's inpatient units. Poor quality in some of these centres appears to be contributing to the UK's high child mortality rate.</p> <p>In its report <a href=\"http://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/sites/default/files/documents/hospitals-on-the-edge-report.pdf\" title=\"\">Hospitals on the Edge?

This is a press statement better suited to the last financial war; the problem is not that the system as a whole is running into deficit <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/www.dh.gov.uk/en/MediaCentre/Speeches/Speecheslist/DH_4131925\" title=\"\">as it did in 2006 and 2007</a>. It is the increasing instability of many acute trusts.</p> <p>As the government's deficit reduction plans stall, the ringfence around the NHS budget looks increasingly unsustainable. The talk in local government is of another savage cut after the general election on top of the 28% already in train, with obvious consequences for social care. Defence is already stripped back. Ideological talk of welfare reform has slammed up against the limitations of policy practicalities and IT systems.</p> <p>The NHS is in danger of being caught in a double bind. It could lose funding while keeping the inefficiencies.</p> <p>Talk among influential figures in government in favour of ending the ringfence is fuelled by the waste they see in the NHS \u2013 poor integration with social care and the high level of avoidable emergency admissions among patients with long term conditions to name just two examples on a long list. But the government baulks at changing the way healthcare is delivered in order to drive out these inefficiencies.</p> <p>Against this backdrop the likes of the <a href=\"http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/\" title=\"\">King's Fund</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.nhsconfed.org/Pages/home.aspx\" title=\"\">NHS Confederation</a> are becoming <a href=\"http://www.nhsconfed.org/PressReleases/Archive/2012/Pages/Confed-comment-RCP-report.aspx\" title=\"\">increasingly frantic in their warnings about what needs to happen</a> and the consequences of inaction. Change has to happen in a planned way, not as a consequence of foundation trusts going bust.</p> <p>It would be unforgiveable if the government responded to the second report from the Francis Report with pious words about the paramount importance of patient safety, another few layers of regulation and verbiage about \"this must never happen again\", while failing to address precisely the weaknesses in hospital care which maximise the likelihood of Mid Staffs being repeated.</p> <p>The politics of winning public support for, or at least grudging acceptance of, reconfiguring hospital services is desperately hard. It needs a clear message about how healthcare needs and treatments have changed and why services need to be delivered differently compared with 50 years ago. The financial issues need to be highlighted as well, but the leading edge must be patient care.</p> <p>Like pensions, energy and defence, healthcare needs policy which is focused on the long term, not the next election. Hunt needs to face up to all this. If he just toys with the health service \u2013 a bit of private sector here, a bit of choice there \u2013 he might just as well go home. He needs to take big, tough decisions.</p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/healthcare/start.php\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the Guardian healthcare network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>"
