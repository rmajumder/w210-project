  "<p>Barack Obama has launched a strident attack on Mitt Romney's refusal to release more than two years of his tax returns, in a rare statement by the president on the issue.</p> <p>Taking questions from reporters in the White House briefing room, Obama brought up Romney's Swiss bank account, insisting that the average American \"would find that relevant information\". In the past, the Obama campaign has preferred to use surrogates to attack Romney on the issue.</p> <p>The president also addressed Todd Akin's comments on \"legitimate rape\", calling the phrase \"offensive\" and saying that \"rape is rape\". The exchange was the first time in two months the president had taken questions from White House reporters.</p> <p>At the press conference, Obama said: \"When it comes to releasing taxes, that's a precedent that was set decades ago \u2013 including by Governor Romney's father.</p> <p>\"I don't think that's in any way out of bounds [to ask for the returns], particularly when we're going to be having a huge debate about how we reform our tax code. I think we need to know that everyone's been playing by the same rules.\"</p> <p>In response to a question about whether Obama thought there was something Mitt Romney was \"not telling us\" in his tax returns, the president said there was a \"difference between not playing by the same set of rules, and doing something illegal\".</p> <p>\"We haven't suggested the latter,\" he said.</p> <p>Asked about the negative tone of the campaign, specifically about an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/09/romney-obama-bain-cancer-ad\">ad from a pro-Obama Super PAC</a> that linked Romney's time at Bain Capital to the death of a woman from cancer, Obama said he had not approved or produced the commercial, adding that it had \"barely run\". </p> <p>The president instead raised the issue of Romney's Swiss bank account, which Romney closed in 2010, saying that the average American \"would find that relevant information, particularly at a time when we know we're going to have to make tough choices about spending and taxes\". He again contrasted Romney's position with that of his father, who was governor of Michigan from 1963 to 1969.</p> <p>\"Governor Romney's own dad says: 'The reason I put out 10 or 12 years [of returns] is that any single year might not tell you the whole story.'\"</p> <p>Obama added: \"The American people have assumed that if you want to be president of the United States, your life's an open book \u2013 at least as far as your finances.</p> <p>\"This isn't overly personal here, guys, this is pretty usual. I don't think we're being mean by asking you to do what every other presidential candidate has done.\"</p> <p>The president also used the briefing to criticise Todd Akin, the Republican senate nominee for Missouri who asserted on Sunday that \"the female body has ways to shut pregnancy down\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/20/todd-akin-legitimate-rape-romney\">if subject to \"legitimate rape\"</a>. </p> <p>Akin had appeared on Mike Huckabee's radio show on Monday afternoon<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/richard-adams-blog/2012/aug/20/romney-campaign-todd-akin-live-politics?newsfeed=true#block-50326f8395cb03723d6abe55\"> to apologize for his comments</a>, saying that he had \"used the wrong words\" but would not leave the race \u2013 although reports have since suggested the Republican party may replace him on the ballot.</p> <p>Obama's briefing came shortly after Akin's appearance, the president insisting that \"rape is rape\".</p> <p>\"The idea that we should be parsing and qualifying and slicing what types of rape we're talking about doesn't make sense to the American people, and certainly doesn't make sense to me.\"</p> <p>Obama said the comments \"underscore why we shouldn't have a bunch of politicians, a majority of whom are men, making healthcare decisions on behalf of women\".</p> <p>Romney's spokesman Ryan Williams released a statement after the president's appearance, criticising Obama's response to the infamous Super PAC advert. </p> <p>\"After spending weeks refusing to denounce his Super Pac's scurrilous ad against Mitt Romney, President Obama once again failed to lead,\" Williams said.</p> <p>\"Worse yet, the president falsely alleged no one in his campaign had accused Mitt Romney of committing a crime. </p> <p>\"President Obama's failure to stand up to dishonest rhetoric and attacks demonstrates yet again he's diminished the office that he holds and his record is nothing more than business as usual in Washington.\"</p>",

No-one had called him to suggest he drop out, he said.</p> <p>His defiance came in spite of criticism from senior Republicans, including White House challenger Mitt Romney and senator John Cornyn, the head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which provides funding for candidates. Barack Obama also denounced his remarks.</p> <p>Both the Republican party and prominent political action committees, known as Super Pacs, said they would withdraw their support. Ad campaigns worth millions of dollars were being scrapped.</p> <p>Akin went on Huckabee's radio show in an attempt to save his position. He said: \"I've really made a couple of serious mistakes here which were just wrong, and I need to apologise for those. There is no such thing as legitimate rape. It's an evil act and it's committed by violent predators.\" He added: \"I've even known some women who have been raped and I know that it's a terrible, terrible thing.\"</p> <p>In spite of the row over his comment that \"legitimate rape\" rarely results in pregnancy, he argued his background and ability made him a big asset in unseating the Democratic incumbent Claire McCaskill.</p> <p>Republicans want him to step aside because the row is threatening the White House race, and reduces the chances of taking the Missouri seat, one the party is banking on to secure a majority in the Senate.</p> <p>In a statement, Cornyn said: \"I recognise this is a difficult time for him, but over the next 24 hours, congressman Akin should carefully consider what is best for him, his family, the Republican party, and the values that he cares about and has fought for throughout his career in public service.\"</p> <p>Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, also urged him to rethink his position, describing his comments as inexcusable.</p> <p>Obama, speaking at the White House at a rare press conference, denounced Akin's comment. \"Rape is rape. And the idea that we should be parsing and qualifying and slicing what types of rape we're talking about doesn't make sense to the American people and certainly doesn't make sense to me.\"</p> <p>He said that politicians, most of whom are men, should not be making healthcare decisions on behalf of women.</p> <p>While accepting that Romney had also denounced Akin, he said there was a significant difference between Democrats and Republicans on the issue. \"The underlying notion that we should be making decisions on behalf of women for their healthcare decisions, or qualifying 'forcible rape' versus 'non-forcible rape' \u2013 those are broader issues \u2026 between me and the other party.\"</p> <p>Asked if he thought Akin should quit, he said he had been chosen by the Republican party in Missouri and the decision was one for it to decide.</p> <p>Earlier, Romney used <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/314452/romney-akins-inexcusable-comment-robert-costa\">an interview with the National Review Online</a> to denounce Akin in unusually forthright language.</p> <p>\"Congressman Akin's comments on rape are insulting, inexcusable, and, frankly, wrong,\" Romney said. \"Like millions of other Americans, we found them to be offensive.\"</p> <p>He added: \"I have an entirely different view. What he said is entirely without merit and he should correct it.\" But he stopped short of calling for Akin to step down.</p> <p>Republican senator Scott Brown became the first member of the party to call publicly for Akin to resign. \"Rep Akin's statement was so far out of bounds that he should resign the nomination for US Senate in Missouri,\" Brown said in a statement.</p> <p>Brown's response is not surprising, given he is well to the left of the party, fighting to retain his seat in a tight race in liberal Massachusetts.</p> <p>Wisconsin senator <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ron4Senate/statuses/237582523465596928\">Ron Johnson also called for Akin to pull out</a>. On Twitter he said: \"Todd Akin's statements are reprehensible and inexcusable. He should step aside for the good of the nation.\" </p> <p>His intervention was more significant as Ryan is from Wisconsin and the latest poll suggests Romney has taken a narrow lead over Obama in the state.</p> <p>But even figures such as Karl Rove, George W Bush's strategist, told Fox News that Akin's \"got some real explaining to do\".</p> <p>Barack Obama's campaign team portrayed the comments by Akin as further evidence of what it has dubbed the Republican \"war on women\".&#xa0;</p> <p>The row began when Akin, in an interview with the St Louis channel KTVI-TV broadcast on Sunday,&#xa0;was asked about his opposition to abortion, even in the case of rape. &#xa0; </p> <p>\"It seems to me, from what I understand from doctors, that's really rare,\" Akin replied. \"If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. But let's assume that maybe that didn't work or something: I think there should be some punishment, but the punishment ought to be of the rapist, and not attacking the child.\" </p> <p>Akin won the Republican primary only this month with the backing of Tea Party groups. The Missouri race, against Democratic Senator Clare McCaskill, was seen as one of the most winnable for the Republicans in its bid to take control of the Senate.</p> <p>Akin is only narrowly ahead in the polls and pollsters predicted his remark is almost certain to lose him a lot of votes, especially among women.</p> <p>But the row could also have implications for the White House campaign as it has focused attention on an area of sensitivity for Romney: the views on abortion of his running mate Paul Ryan. </p> <p>In a statement released after Akin's remarks, Romney's campaign team said: \"Governor Romney and congressman Ryan disagree with Mr Akin's statement, and a Romney-Ryan administration would not oppose abortion in instances of rape.\"</p> <p>But the statement leaves questions about Ryan unanswered. Until the statement was released Ryan had been opposed to abortion even in the case of rape. Ryan was the co-sponsor of a House bill last year called the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act that included what it referred to as \"forcible rape\", though the phrase was later dropped after a backlash from women's groups.</p> <p>Romney has an ambiguous record on abortion, promising while campaigning for governor of Massachusetts not to change existing law but adopting&#xa0;a tougher position when campaigning to become the Republican presidential nominee. </p> <p>Ryan, by contrast, has been consistently opposed to abortion in almost all circumstances.</p> <p>Akin's opponent, Claire McCaskill, a close ally of Obama's, said that Akin had not addressed several issues raised by his original comments, including his comment that women's bodies closed down during rape. &#xa0; </p> <p>She called on Akin to apologise for that and other contentious statements, but rather than join the calls for him to quit she warned the Republican leadership that any attempt to oust him as the candidate would backfire. </p> <p>McCaskill, seeking re-election, was widely regarded as vulnerable but her opponent's remarks play into her strategy of painting him as an extremist, provided he remains the candidate.&#xa0;</p> <p>Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, head of the Democratic National Committee, sought to broaden the issue beyond Missouri politics, accusing Republicans of wanting to \"take women back to the Dark Ages\".</p> <p>She added: \"The real issue is a Republican party \u2013 led by Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan \u2013 whose policies on women and their health are dangerously wrong.\"</p>",
  "<p>When the Bo Xilai issue first erupted in March and the details of Neil Heywood's murder began to emerge, it was commonly accepted that this posed a huge challenge to the Chinese leadership at a most sensitive time \u2013 the imminent change in the composition of the party and government leadership, an event which is surely of greater significance for the world than the forthcoming US presidential election.</p> <p>There was understandable speculation that Bo Xilai's detention could lead to wider rifts in the party leadership that might prove very difficult to manage and which might even lead to the postponement of the forthcoming party congress until the early months of next year.</p> <p>Following the trial of Gu Kailai, Bo Xilai's wife, and her sentencing on Monday, we can now view these events from a different vantage point. Whatever the widespread misgivings about the trial and the closed nature of the proceedings \u2013 and the fact that the whole process has clearly been vetted at the highest levels \u2013 the explanation as to what happened, the verdict and now the sentence has commanded a certain degree of credence. The explanations, though far from comprehensive, are, in the circumstances, more or less plausible: the conflict between Gu and Heywood, the threat to her son, the nature of their financial dealings, and the subsequent murder.</p> <p>Likewise, the nature of the sentence \u2013 a suspended death penalty that could in practice mean a prison term of 14 years \u2013 has been viewed in the west as not inappropriate.</p> <p>After months when it appeared as if the scandal might derail the party leadership, it now appears as if it is once more firmly in control of events. Any wider rifts that might have existed now seem to be under control \u2013 or, more likely perhaps, the ructions following Bo's arrest were rather more limited than some have speculated, though in the absence of any hard information it is impossible to be sure.</p> <p>With the Gu Kailai trial now closed, there remains the key question of what will happen to Bo himself, the overwhelmingly dominant player, without whom Heywood would still be unknown and Gu likewise. Bo Xilai is being investigated for \"serious disciplinary violations\" and it is widely expected that some kind of conclusion will be reached in the matter prior to the party congress.</p> <p>Are there any conclusions that might be drawn at this stage, premature as they may well prove to be? From outward appearances, it seems as if the party is now within touching distance of overseeing a smooth transition to a new leadership, with Xi Jinping as the next president and Li Keqiang as the next premier. This will only be the second time this has been achieved since Mao, the first being the handover from Jiang Zemin to Hu Jintao. Similarly wholesale changes in the standing committee of the party, presently composed of nine people \u2013 and the body to which Bo was so energetically and ruthlessly campaigning to be admitted \u2013 are likely to be achieved without too much collateral damage.</p> <p>There has been much speculation that, with China facing a new and difficult set of challenges, the Bo case was likely to become entwined with a range of growing policy disagreements. The difficult policy choices have certainly not gone away but it would appear that the Bo case has been sidelined without it serving to exacerbate the debates that are occupying the present leadership and which will surely dominate the agenda of the incoming leadership. This is no mean achievement.</p> <p>It has been suggested, finally, that the Bo case is the biggest political conflict to have shaken Beijing since the Cultural Revolution. This has always appeared to be something of an over-statement. One only has to think of the prolonged struggle between Mao's chosen successor, Hua Guofeng, and Deng Xiaoping after Mao's death to realise that this was a febrile exaggeration. Given the issues that we now know were at stake in their argument, then whatever the present disagreements, they could hardly have been more fundamental or far-reaching than those between Deng and Hua. Deng, after all, was about to take China in an entirely new direction and utterly transform the country in the process.</p> <p><em>Martin Jacques is the author of When China Rules the World: The End of the Western World and the Birth of a New Global Order</em></p>",
  "<p>The 15 August gathering at Paul Ryan's alma mater, Miami University in southwestern Ohio, was already fired up when the congressman segued into a remarkable line:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The president, I'm told, is talking about Medicare today. We want this debate. We need this debate. And we will win this debate.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The crowd erupted in cheers. And with that, a most curious battle was joined.</p> <p>If the first few days of the Ryan nomination saw much confusion as to just who controlled the GOP ticket's narrative \u2014 the Romney campaign even appeared to disavow the \"Ryan plan\" within the first 24 hours \u2014 then its fifth day appeared to answer the question. In a season of some of the worst economic distress since the Great Depression, the Romney-Ryan duo is going to run on entitlements. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/11/mitt-romney-acquires-risky-asset-paul-ryan-vp\">As I noted on the day the VP pick was announced</a>, Mitt Romney is now running on the programmatic agenda \u2014 and the record \u2014 of his putative second.</p> <p>There is some logic to this, although the execution appears to have less. In the Tea Party era, fiscal rectitude, normally the province of Beltway media and policy types, is politically saleable at a popular level in ways it hasn't been since the 1920s. The problem is that there's not much data demonstrating its appeal beyond Republican primary electorates. The perennial unpopularity of the various Ryan plans, surely among the most mild examples of fiscal rectitude in existence (since they take 30 years to balance the federal budget), only underlines the point.</p> <p>This brings us to the political illogic in the Republican ticket's \"entitlements\" fight, which is, of late, on full display in the Mitt Romney Twitter feed: \"Interesting that @BarackObama admits that he cut $716bn from Medicare from current seniors to pay for Obamacare,\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MittRomney/status/236456318217617408\">reads one of many</a>. This is based upon a juxtaposition of two sets of data: the first being the enduring unpopularity of Obamacare, with 56% of Americans favoring full repeal in the latest Rasmussen poll; and the second being, as <a href=\"http://decoded.nationaljournal.com/2012/08/the-gop-counterargument-on-med.php\">Josh Krashaaur explained at National Journal on 17 August</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Polls conducted in 28 battleground districts for the National Republican Congressional Committee, obtained by National Journal, which suggest Republicans aren't as vulnerable on the Medicare debate as the conventional wisdom suggests.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The NRCC polls in question here did, indeed, yield positive numbers for the Republicans: when the details of the Ryan plan were set against those of the Democratic critique, the former came out ahead by a respectable, though not crushing margin. But the methodology as described seems to provide a poor template for a campaign, depending as it does on well-informed voters making well-considered choices. This may be music to the ears of Boston, which revels in the actuarial appeal and the irrefutable balance sheet; but it may be the same to those of Chicago, which specializes in the gut punch and the emotive appeal.</p> <p>It's worth recalling the perhaps apocryphal story of the woman gushing to Adlai Stevenson: \"You have the vote of every thinking person.\"</p> <p>\"That's not enough, madam,\" he replied. \"We need a majority.\"</p> <p>The plain fact is that the Romney-Ryan campaign messaging here is fraught with risk. The trope about entitlements in American politics is that they constitute the \"third rail\": untouchable at peril of electoral death. The Republicans aren't really challenging that. Instead, in the first presidential election since the birth of the Tea Party, they're casting themselves as the saviors of the federal entitlements state. This is a strange turn of events, and one is hard-pressed to imagine the Democrats not exceeding them in this sphere.</p> <p>If the GOP ticket succeeds at it, though \u2014 a big if \u2014 then it will signify a tremendous shift in the partisan positioning on the big issues in American life. If the Obama presidency has neutralized the Republican advantage in national security issues for the first time in a generation, then a Republican victory on this front would be another sign of a grand realignment in our national life. In US politics, even the most illogical choices may, with hindsight, prove to have made perfect sense.</p>",
  "<p><strong>I have noticed a lot of talk of late in the press about Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney's running mate, and his suits. Is this really an issue?</strong></p> <p><em>Matt, by email</em></p> <p>Yes, Matt, it is. Sure, there are other far more, shall we say, politically relevant issues, such as his <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelwaldholz/2012/08/13/why-ryans-medicare-fantasy-doesnt-merit-adult-conversation/\" title=\"\">frankly terrifying plans for Medicare</a> and how they will affect the elderly in the United States (other than Ryan's mother, that is, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/18/paul-ryan-mother-medicare-florida\" title=\"\">he duly trotted out</a> last weekend to prove that he is not the gerontocidal maniac he has been painted as being, at&#xa0;least not in the case of his mother.) There's <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/79856.html\" title=\"\">his belief that abortion shouldn't ever be legal</a>, even in cases of rape or incest. There's his <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/08/11/677051/meet-paul-ryan-climate-denier-conspiracy-theorist-koch-acolyte/\" title=\"\">scepticism about climate change</a>. There's his long-standing admiration for Ayn Rand, which, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/13/paul-ryan-ayn-rand-romney\" title=\"\">as my colleague Giles Fraser wrote</a> last week, and <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/222003-catholic-bishops-criticize-ryan-budget-cuts-to-food-stamps\" title=\"\">as Catholic bishops&#xa0;in the US also said</a>, somewhat contradicts his oft-trumpeted Christian faith. There's the way his selection makes Romney look more of a weak flip-flopper than ever, seeing as he has said he <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/aug/15/news/la-pn-romney-paul-ryan-medicare-cuts-20120815\" title=\"\">doesn't even agree with Ryan on&#xa0;various crucial issues</a> and yet&#xa0;nonetheless selected him, which I'm sure had <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/08/12/rupert-murdoch-gets-his-man-as-mitt-romney-picks-paul-ryan.html\" title=\"\">nothing to do with Rupert Murdoch</a> and various other&#xa0;big cogs pushing for Romney to&#xa0;do so.</p> <p>There's Ryan's occasional trouble with the truth, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2012/08/16/paul-ryans-stimulus-problem/\" title=\"\">to say nothing of consistency</a>, such as when it recently transpired that, despite voting against the stimulus bill, and his repeated denials that he&#xa0;then asked for stimulus funds on behalf of local businesses in Wisconsin (\"I'm not gonna vote [against] something and then write letters to the government to send us money. I did not request any stimulus money,\" he told a radio station in 2010), he actually did \u2013 and perhaps you can sense the way the wind is blowing in this sentence \u2013 send letters to the government asking for stimulus funds for local businesses.</p> <p>Finally, there's the fascinating contradiction this throws up for older white voters who don't particularly fancy voting for Obama but, on the other hand, want to hold on tight to their Medicare. All of this then leads us inexorably to the corner into which the Republican party seems increasingly determined to paint itself, a corner inaccessible to moderates and old-school Republicans and favoured only by the fringe and hysterical.</p> <p>So yes, there are things to discuss other than Ryan's suits. But that doesn't mean they shouldn't be discussed at all. I say that not from a fashion writer's perspective, nor even from a feminist's (although certainly the feminist part of me is cheered that a male politician's wardrobe has been perused in the US press with the kind of scrutiny usually reserved for the ladies. Equally, the fashion writer part of me is delighted that the mainstream press is as bugged by things such as&#xa0;shoulder pads and trouser lengths as&#xa0;me.</p> <p>Last week, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/ryan-and-romney-a-contrast-in-sartorial-styles/2012/08/14/da09ea70-e642-11e1-8f62-58260e3940a0_print.html\" title=\"\">the Washington Post&#xa0;devoted 700 words to discussing Ryan's \"sloppy\" suits</a>.

That's the&#xa0;least of his flaws, right? Sure but it's still an interesting stylistic tic of Ryan's because it's not that he dresses badly \u2013 it's that he buys clothes that are&#xa0;too big for him. Ryan is known to be quite a workout fiend and, judging from the sound of his exercise regime, must have the body of an Olympian. He's clearly no shrinking violet in terms of putting himself forward. Why&#xa0;\u2013 or what \u2013 is he hiding?</p> <p>There are only three possibilities:</p> <p>1. He used to be a bit plumper and hasn't had time to buy new clothes;</p> <p>2. He is compensating for his desired&#xa0;lack of coverage in older people's medical insurance by giving himself extra coverage in his clothes;</p> <p>3. He's one of Those Guys who, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/16/fashion/a-look-at-paul-ryans-fashion-sense.html\" title=\"\">as the New York Times's Bruce Pask puts&#xa0;it</a>, confuses ovesized clothes with masculinity and is therefore trying to compensate for his perceived lack of manliness by bulking up sartorially.</p> <p>Number 1 we can rule out because we know from photos Ryan wasn't plumper in the recent past. Number 2 is possible, but obviously ridiculous. Number 3 it is and it also explains Ryan's aggression towards the elderly, poor and women.

  "<p>Mogadishu is waking up from a 21-year nightmare. Countless buildings lie pulverised while people squat in tents amid the rubble but, at least for some in the capital, the war appears to have receded. Peace is a relative word, as two suicide bombers recently made clear, but in the past year al-Shabaab has suffered dramatic reverses, losing territory, revenue, and some measure of unity. The foreign armies that roamed Somalia are either putting themselves under the command of the African Union Mission in Somalia (Amisom), as is the case with the Djiboutian and Kenyan forces, or indicating that they intend to withdraw.</p> <p>The improvement in security has been enough to encourage <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/19/somalians-planning-better-future\" title=\"\">Somali expats to return</a>. A rare mood of optimism is in the air, as on Monday members of a new parliament were sworn in, whose first duty will be to choose a new president, prime minister and speaker. The process has been dogged by delays, as members have been nominated by tribal elders, vetted by a committee on the hunt for warlords, and subject to a welter of allegations of intimidation and corruption. But the hope is that, along with a new draft constitution, better governance will result.</p> <p>Is this optimism misplaced? Much will depend on how new the new government is. A&#xa0;UN report leaked recently showed how much of a problem the outgoing Transitional Federal Government (TFG) had become. As the same cast of characters are all reapplying for their old jobs as president, prime minister and speaker of parliament, the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/sc/committees/751/mongroup.shtml\" title=\"\">report of the UN Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea</a> was not merely of historical value.</p> <p>In May this year a World Bank report found that $131m, representing 68% of TFG government revenue, was unaccounted for. The monitoring group went one step further. It&#xa0;found that seven out of every 10 dollars never made it into the state's coffers, and almost one quarter of it was absorbed by the offices of the president, prime minister and speaker of parliament. That's almost as much as the whole government spent on security. If the TFG had a motto, it should be the popular Somali phrase: \"What's in it for me?\"</p> <p>Sheikh Sharif Ahmed, who has vowed to step down if he lost the vote of the parliament being sworn in, called the UN report fabricated and a lie. But it is clear that the extent to which people like Ahmed re-emerge in the new transitional arrangements will also be the extent of the challenge the new government faces. This is a country in which no election will be possible for some time to come. It has no working national institutions.

  "<p>The hallowed fairways of Augusta National, the home of golf's annual Masters tournament, are being opened up to women for the first time, ending an increasingly controversial and anachronistic ban on female membership which had survived for 80 years.</p> <p>Bowing to the not-so-modern concept of gender equality, the club announced on Monday it had invited two female members to join the club: former US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and South Carolina financier Darla Moore. </p> <p>\"This is a joyous occasion,\" club chairman Billy Payne said in a statement. \"We are fortunate to consider many qualified candidates for membership at Augusta National. Consideration with regard to any candidate is deliberate, held in strict confidence and always takes place over an extended period of time. The process for Condoleezza and Darla was no different.</p> <p>\"These accomplished women share our passion for the game of golf and both are well known and respected by our membership,\" Payne continued. \"It will be a proud moment when we present Condoleezza and Darla their green jackets when the club opens this fall.\"</p> <p>In a statement released by the club, Rice, who served in George Bush's administration, said she looked forward to \"playing golf, renewing friendships and forming new ones through this very special opportunity\".</p> <p>Moore, the vice-president of private investment firm Rainwater, said being asked to join the Augusta National represented \"a very happy and important occasion in my life\".</p> <p>The announcement marks the end of a rearguard action by Payne and the Augusta leadership against the march of sexual equality. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/apr/04/masters-2012\">As recently as the last Masters tournament in April, Payne had reaffirmed the all-male policy</a>.</p> <p>After successfully fending off demands to admit women members, the club faced intense scrutiny this year following the appointment of Ginni Rometty as IBM's chief executive officer. IBM is a major sponsor of the Masters, and Rometty's four predecessors had been invited to become members of the club. However, no such invitation was issued to Rometty.</p> <p>In the ensuing controversy, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/apr/06/augusta-national-golf-club-women-members\">Barack Obama and his Republican challenger Mitt Romney joined the calls</a> for Augusta to abandon its men-only rule.</p> <p>Martha Burk of the National Council of Women's Organisations, who has led the campaign for the club to admit women since 2002, said she was delighted at the news, but added that her invitation to join had yet to arrive. </p> <p>\"I am very pleased. The woman's movement has prevailed,\" she said. \"It took a decade, but we did it. It is definitely a vindication.\"</p> <p>She added: \"If I get an invite I will accept, absolutely.\"</p> <p>Burk had repeatedly clashed with then Augusta chairman Hootie Johnson, who defended the policy even when it meant losing television sponsorship. Corporate sponsors, unnerved by the controversy over sexism, pulled out of the 2003 and 2004 Masters tournaments.</p> <p>Before stepping down in 2006, Johnson conceded that Augusta National might one day have a woman in a green jacket, \"but not at the point of a bayonet.\" It became a battle cry for stubborn male members.</p> <p>Although under the previous policy women were prohibited from gaining membership, they were allowed onto the course as guests.</p> <p>It should not be surprising that Augusta National has taken so long to fall in line with the rest of society. The club, which opened in in December 1932, only accepted its first black member in 1990.</p>",
  "<p>The row over the \"legitimate rape\" comments of a Republican congressman has brought renewed attention on the staunchly pro-life views of the party's vice-presidential candidate, Paul Ryan.</p> <p>Mitt Romney's campaign managers moved swiftly to limit the damage from remarks made by Todd Akin, the Republican senate candidate for Missouri, who suggested women could not become pregnant from being raped.</p> <p>A \"Romney-Ryan administration would not oppose abortion in instances of rape,\" the campaign said in a statement. </p> <p>But commentators on Monday moved to point out that the statement appeared to contradict the Republican vice-presidential candidate's earlier positions on the issue.</p> <p>Ryan, a staunch pro-lifer, was a co-sponsor of a controversial House bill last year defining life as the moment of fertilisation and granting \"personhood\" rights to embryos. Abortion rights activist say the Sanctity of Human Life Act would have outlawed all abortions, restrict some forms of contraception, in-vitro fertilisation and stem-cell research. </p> <p>The bill never made it onto the floor of the house. All state attempts to introduce so-called \"personhood\" amendments into law have failed, even in conservative states. It was rejected in Mississippi in November 2011.</p> <p>Ryan also voted for and co-sponsored house bill dubbed the \"let women die\" bill by pro-choice campaigners. The bill would allow hospitals to deny emergency abortions, even when it is necessary to save a woman's life.</p> <p>He was also a co-sponsor of the ultrasound informed consent act, which requires a women seeking an abortion to undergo an ultrasound even if not medically necessary and forced doctors to provide images and descriptions of the foetus to her.</p> <p>His record on the issue of abortion and reproductive rights is such that the pro-life National Right to Life Committee awarded him a 100% pro-life voting record and said he had not once voted against its position in his 14 years in the House. It recorded 59 votes that Ryan took on abortion-related bills, including the partial birth abortion ban act and the no taxpayer funding for abortion act.</p> <p>Ryan, Akin and most of the House GOP s<a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/08/todd-akin-paul-ryan-redefining-rape\">upported a bill that would have narrowed the already few exceptions</a> to the laws banning federal funding for abortion \u2013 from all cases of rape to cases of \"forcible rape\".</p> <p>When Ryan was picked as Romney's running mate, the pro-life movement sent out press releases enthusiastically greeting his selection.</p> <p>Last week, President Barack Obama's campaign muddied the waters on Ryan's position on the issue. Shortly after the formal announcement of Ryan's selection, Obama's team tweeted that Ryan would ban would ban abortions even in cases of rape and incest and had sponsored a bill that would outlaw some forms of birth control. The Democratic campaign emailed female supporters to stress Ryan's views.</p> <p>\"Make sure the women in your life know: Paul Ryan supports banning all abortions, even in cases of rape or incest.\"</p> <p>However, although Ryan has favoured stricter anti-abortion views than Romney, he has favoured abortions in situations where an abortion is needed to save the life of the mother.</p> <p>\"I'm as pro-life as a person gets,\" Ryan told The Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine, in 2010.</p> <p>In a 2010 essay for a conservative thinktank, Ryan compared the US supreme court ruling that legalized abortion to the infamous 1857 Dred Scott decision, in which the court ruled that black slaves were not legally people. </p> <p>Ryan wrote: \"After America has won the last century's hard-fought struggles against unequal human rights in the forms of totalitarianism abroad and segregation at home, I cannot believe any official or citizen can still defend the notion that an unborn human being has no rights.\" </p> <p>When he first won election to Congress in 1998, Ryan vowed to oppose all abortions unless they were needed to save the life of the mother. He voted for a bill barring anyone besides parents from transporting minors across state lines for abortions. He also voted against a measure to allow women in the military to receive abortions in military hospitals.</p> <p>No one from the NRLC or Americans United for Life \u2013 two of the groups supporting Ryan \u2013 was available for comment when contacted by the Guardian on Monday.</p>",
  "<p>A dusty seaside car park with black folding chairs was the makeshift setting on Monday for the first parliament to sit in Somalia for more than two decades.</p> <p>About 250 MPs wearing new ID tags and, in some cases, the scent of cologne were sworn in by the chief justice on worn copies of the Qur'an in front of Somalia's national flag of a white star on sky blue background.</p> <p>It was a day that many hope will mark a new chapter after the civil war and bloodshed that followed the collapse of central government in 1991. But sceptics warn that the process is already tainted and prone to unravel.</p> <p>The inauguration was held at the main airport, one of the most heavily secured areas of the capital, Mogadishu, watched over by African Union peacekeepers in armoured Casspir personnel carriers. Just over a year after the militant Islamist group al-Shabaab was driven out of the city, suicide bombings and assassinations remain a constant threat.</p> <p>Although ordinary citizens could not vote, there was campaigning in Mogadishu, with election posters hanging on buildings and from cars, a scene scarcely imaginable when it was a war zone.</p> <p>By the end of the day, Somalia had achieved a parliament, still some way short of the final target of 275 members. There should also have been a new president and speaker but, in a transition process that has taken a year longer than the original 2011 deadline, the international community has had to lower expectations.</p> <p>For now, the oldest member of parliament, the former army general Muse Hassan, has been inaugurated as the interim speaker to oversee the political wrangling in weeks to come.</p> <p>The switch from the UN-backed leadership structure known as the transitional federal government (TFG), which ruled for eight years, to this new phase has been characterised more by selection than election.</p> <p>All the MPs vowing loyalty to the country's provisional constitution have had their names put forward by 135 traditional elders and been vetted by a technical selection committee in an attempt to ensure they are educated and gender balanced. The constitution demands that 30% of MPs are female; so far it is closer to 20%.</p> <p>The vetting process is also intended to exclude warlords, who have long been agents of chaos in the Horn of Africa country. The 27 Somalis and nine international observers on the committee said they had fended off telephone death threats and turned away brown envelopes of encouragement.</p> <p>The optimism of the moment is therefore qualified. \"It's a defining time in Somalia,\" said Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, chairman of the Peace and Development party. \"The playing field is not level and I'm not saying Somalia will get what it deserves, but it will be better than the status quo.\"</p> <p>On Sunday, two press conferences reflected the rhetoric of the process to date. An array of diplomats and UN officials painted an upbeat picture, claiming their efforts to steer Somalia's troubled transition back on course have succeeded, and brushing aside fears that there have been many false dawns before.</p> <p>\"It's going to be a qualitatively different parliament than anything you've seen before,\" said Augustine Mahiga, the UN special representative to Somalia. \"It's certainly the beginning of legitimate, representative and accountable institutions.\"</p> <p>But the Somali president, Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, has accused the selection committee members of overstepping their bounds by not including those he felt should be MPs.</p> <p>As a morning drizzle fell on inauguration day, rumours of protests and security worries circulated by text message.</p> <p>UN officials confirmed a quiet meeting was held between Mahiga and the president in an attempt to smooth things over, but the uneasy truce has left a sense of trepidation on the streets of Mogadishu.</p> <p>Abdi Fatah, a former parliamentary official who is now an aid worker, said: \"We're fearing that if he doesn't win, the president won't give up his palace. And his people \u2013 his clan \u2013 may do demonstrations in the streets.\"</p> <p>Some external observers have condemned the regionally brokered and UN-backed roadmap as deeply flawed. The International Crisis Group said: \"The current political process has been as undemocratic as the one it seeks to replace, with unprecedented levels of political interference, corruption and intimidation. The end of the transition roadmap process \u2013 a that is supposed to usher in an inclusive political dispensation\u2013 may fail to bring stability.</p> <p>\"Convening an incomplete parliament and electing a contested, tainted leadership in Somalia's polarised political environment could easily unravel the painstaking humanitarian, political and security progress made in the past three years. The extremist Islamist movement al-Shabaab is down but not out, and it is evolving, and plots to take advantage of the resulting chaos to regain power.\"</p> <p>Those benefiting from the capital's economic rebirth say the flow of investment, reconstruction and good intentions is fragile, and political instability could destroy all they have achieved.</p> <p>While the composition of decision-makers in the fledgling assembly is a mix of old timers and new faces, some analysts warn it could simply perpetuate an ongoing power struggle between the TFG speaker, Sharif Hassan Sheikh Adan, and the president.\u00ac</p> <p>It has turned into a numbers game. The magic number is 4.5, a formula that acknowledges the primacy of Somali clan loyalties, ensuring that the spoils of power can theoretically be divided between the four main groups \u2013 the Hawiye, Darod, Dir, and Rahaweyn \u2013 and the \"others\", an amalgamation of smaller clans.</p> <p>In coming days and weeks, the full 275-member parliament, a number divisible by 4.5, will vote for a speaker in a secret ballot, to be followed by a similar process for the presidency.</p> <p>But one new MP, Sahra Korrshell, 58, smiled with quiet pride as she explained that she had responded to the call of her clan, the Darod. She gazed over the sea of faces and reflected: \"It's a hard task ahead, but change is good. When new people come, they do things differently, and that's what Somalia needs now.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Republican candidate at the centre of a firestorm over his claim that \"legitimate rape\" rarely results in pregnancy is facing growing pressure to stand down as the row threatens to undermine both the party's White House and Senate campaigns.&#xa0;</p> <p>Todd Akin, a Tea Party-backed congressman from Missouri who is running for the US Senate, was rounded on by senior members of his own party, as well as his Democratic opponent and women's groups.</p> <p>Mitt Romney, the Republican candidate for president, used <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/314452/romney-akins-inexcusable-comment-robert-costa\">an interview with the National Review Online</a> to denounce Akin in unusually forthright language that throws into doubt Akin's survival as a candidate. &#xa0;</p> <p>\"Congressman Akin's comments on rape are insulting, inexcusable, and, frankly, wrong,\" Romney said. \"Like millions of other Americans, we found them to be offensive.\"</p> <p>He added: \"I have an entirely different view. What he said is entirely without merit and he should correct it.\"</p> <p>But he stopped short of calling for Akin to step down.</p> <p>Republican senator Scott Brown became the first member of the party to break ranks and call publicly for Akin to resign. \"Rep Akin's statement was so far out of bounds that he should resign the nomination for US Senate in Missouri,\" Brown said in a statement.</p> <p>Brown's response is not surprising, given he is well to the left of the party, fighting to retain his seat in a tight race in liberal Massachusetts.</p> <p>Wisconsin senator <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ron4Senate/statuses/237582523465596928\">Ron Johnson also called for Akin to pull out</a>. On Twitter he said: \"Todd Akin's statements are reprehensible and inexcusable. He should step aside for the good of the nation.\" </p> <p>His intervention is potentially significant as vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan is from Wisconsin and the latest poll suggests Romney has taken a narrow lead over Obama in the state.</p> <p>But even figures such as Karl Rove, George W Bush's strategist, told Fox News that Akin's \"got some real explaining to do\".</p> <p>Barack Obama's campaign team portrayed the comments by Akin as further evidence of what it has dubbed the Republican 'war on women'.&#xa0;</p> <p>The row began when Akin, in an interview with the St Louis channel KTVI-TV broadcast on Sunday,&#xa0;was asked about his opposition to abortion, even in the case of rape. &#xa0; </p> <p>\"It seems to me, from what I understand from doctors, that's really rare,\" Akin replied. \"If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. But let's assume that maybe that didn't work or something: I think there should be some punishment, but the punishment ought to be of the rapist, and not attacking the child.\" </p> <p>Akin won the Republican primary only this month with the backing of Tea Party groups. The Missouri race, against Democratic Senator Clare McCaskill, was seen as one of the most winnable for the Republicans in its bid to take control of the Senate.</p> <p>Akin is only narrowly ahead in the polls and pollsters predicted his remark is almost certain to lose him a lot of votes, especially among women.</p> <p>But the row could also have implications for the White House campaign as it has focused attention on an area of sensitivity for Romney: the views on abortion of his running mate Paul Ryan. </p> <p>In a statement released after Akin's remarks, Romney's campaign team said: \"Governor Romney and Congressman Ryan disagree with Mr Akin's statement, and a Romney-Ryan administration would not oppose abortion in instances of rape.\"</p> <p>But the statement leaves questions about Ryan unanswered. Until the statement was released Ryan had been opposed to abortion even in the case of rape. Ryan was the co-sponsor of a House bill last year called 'No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act' that included what it referred to as \"forcible rape\", though the phrase was later dropped after a backlash from women's groups.</p> <p>The Obama campaign, which has successfully dictated the agenda of the White House race over the last few weeks, is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6MTwBlJk5E&amp;feature=player_embedded \">running a campaign ad in swing states</a> focusing on Romney and Ryan's views on abortion. The ad said Romney had made his VP choice but \"what choice will women be left with?\"</p> <p>The ad says that both Romney and Ryan support proposals to outlaw abortion even in the case of rape and incest.</p> <p>Romney has an ambiguous record on abortion, promising while campaigning for governor of Massachusetts not to change existing law but adopting&#xa0;a tougher position when campaigning to become the Republican presidential nominee. </p> <p>Ryan, by contrast, has been consistently opposed to abortion in almost all circumstances.</p> <p>The row is a distraction the Romney-Ryan team did not need as the two were campaigning Monday in New Hampshire.&#xa0;On the stump together, they sought to discuss Medicare, an issue on which they are vulnerable, anxious to have the debate now rather than later in the campaign, and the slowness of the economic recovery.</p> <p>Akin, later on Sunday, partially backtracked from his earlier remarks, saying he had been speaking off the record and had \"misspoke\". <br>&#xa0;<br>He added: \"I recognise that abortion, and particularly in the case of rape, is a very emotionally charged issue. But I believe deeply in the protection of all life, and I do not believe that harming another innocent victim is the right course of action.\"</p> <p>His opponent, Claire McCaskill, a close ally of Obama, said that Akin had not addressed several issues, including his comment that women's bodies closed down during rape. &#xa0; </p> <p>She called on Akin to apologise for that and other contentious statements, but rather than join the calls for him to quit she warned the Republican leadership that any attempt to oust him as the candidate would backfire. </p> <p>\"I think for Washington party insiders to come in and try to invalidate the votes of Missourians would be radical,\" McCaskill said <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/20/claire-mccaskill-todd-akin-legitimate-rape_n_1810351.html?utm_hp_ref=elections-2012\">in a phone interview with The Huffington Post</a>. </p> <p>McCaskill, seeking re-election, was widely regarded as vulnerable but her opponent's remarks play into her strategy of painting him as an extremist, provided he remains the candidate.&#xa0;</p> <p>Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, head of the Democratic National Committee, sought to broaden the issue beyond Missouri politics, accusing Republicans of wanting to \"take women back to the Dark Ages\".</p> <p>She added: \"The real issue is a Republican party \u2013 led by Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan \u2013 whose policies on women and their health are dangerously wrong.\"</p>",

Perhaps it's a bottomless barrel. Or what if the barrel were to roll down a hill, making its bottom, measured relative to sea level, even lower than before? Urgent questions, I'm sure you'll agree.</p> <p>Except that \u2013 as former Obama campaigner Blake Zeff laid out this weekend in <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/blakezeff/this-isnt-the-nastiest-campaign-ever-708z\">an excellent piece at Buzzfeed</a> \u2013 the \"meanest campaign ever\" claim falls apart the minute you scrutinise it. \"It's not [even] the most negative campaign of your lifetime, unless you happen to be three years old,\" Zeff writes. This year, the Obama campaign has alleged that decisions made by Mitt Romney resulted in a Missouri woman's death; in 2008, Sarah Palin accused Obama of <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/04/palin-obama-is-palling-around-with-terrorists/\">\"palling around with terrorists\"</a>; in 2004, Dick Cheney suggested that a John Kerry presidency would put the US at risk of a <a href=\"http://articles.cnn.com/2004-09-07/politics/cheney.terror_1_dick-cheney-edwards-of-north-carolina-kerry-administration?_s=PM:ALLPOLITICS\">\"devastating\" terrorist attack</a>. John McCain tweeted that this year's campaigning was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenJohnMcCain/status/235779859354353664\">\"the worst I've ever seen\"</a>, apparently forgetting Karl Rove's efforts in 2000 to <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/dirty-tricks-south-carolina-and-john-mccain\">spread the rumour that he had fathered an illegitimate black child</a>. Remember Palin's <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2008/10/17/palin-touts-the-pro-america-areas-of-the-country/\">\"pro-America areas\"</a> of the country? What about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Horton\">Willie Horton</a>? Or the barrel-scraping of 1800, when Team Jefferson accused their rival, John Adams, of having a <a href=\"http://articles.cnn.com/2008-08-22/living/mf.campaign.slurs.slogans_1_jefferson-family-sally-hemings-vice-president-jefferson?_s=PM:LIVING\">\"hideous hermaphroditical character\"</a>, part of a campaign so generally negative that it would have given Brit Hume a conniption?</p> <p>Even if you could reliably measure meanness, then, this surely wouldn't be the meanest campaign ever. All we're witnessing is this year's version of what I suppose we'd better call the meta-campaign. It's a time-honoured tactic: when your campaign isn't going so well, simply make your campaigning about the campaigning instead. It is no surprise whatsoever that Romney's advisor Eric Ferhnstrom <a href=\"http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-08-19/news/ct-oped-0819-page-20120819_1_romney-campaign-team-romney-lis-smith\">has been leading</a> the \"meanest ever\" charge, nor that he should be joined in it by Trump, who as birther-in-chief long surrendered any standing to accuse anyone else of meanness. The promotion of Paul Ryan as a \"serious\" vice-presidential candidate \u2013 to be contrasted with that gaffe-prone liability Joe Biden, as if Biden's gaffe-proneness were somehow news \u2013 is arguably another example of the meta-campaign. Don't think too hard about what a Romney administration would actually do to Medicare, the insinuation goes; don't focus on whether the charges being made are truthful. Instead, give us credit for elevating the campaign by discussing the issue at all. </p> <p>To the politicians who deploy it, the benefits of meta-campaigning are obvious: you get to claim the moral high ground, implicitly casting yourself in the non-partisan position of a commentator on the campaigns, as opposed to a dirty-handed participant. More baffling is why <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/79748.html\">campaign reporters continue to fall for it</a>, year after year, then enthusiastically start making the \"meanest ever\" charge themselves. The most cynical interpretation is just that they need August stories. Nearer the truth, I suspect, is that it appeals to their obsession with appearing \"balanced\", regardless of the real distribution of mendacity between the two sides. In this sense, \"the meanest campaign ever\" is a premier case of the <a href=\"http://pressthink.org/2010/11/the-view-from-nowhere-questions-and-answers/\">View From Nowhere</a>. It pretends to neutrality (thereby offending nobody) while still purporting to embody a moral judgment and pack a rhetorical punch, thereby seeming astute. </p> <p>And if voters grow wise to all this? Then, I'm afraid, it'll be time for politicians to unleash the meta-meta-campaign: claiming the high ground by campaigning about how the other side is campaigning about the campaign. There's already a hint of this in <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/tv/gibbs-romney-cant-criticize-obama-tone-when-supported-by-right-wing-nutjob-donald-trump/\">Robert Gibbs's response</a> to the meanness charge (and I suppose this blog post is an example of it, too). And after that? Meta-meta-meta \u2026 you get the picture. This isn't the meanest campaign in history. But perhaps by November we'll be able to say with confidence that it was the most meta.</p>",
  "<p>I'm always interested in situations where preconceptions clash with hard facts and cause disquiet among partisans in one camp or another. Paul Ryan's promotion to Mitt Romney's ideological minder and running mate last week was one such example. (Should conservatives be thrilled or alarmed?) So was last <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/19/striking-south-african-miners-face-company-ultimatum\" title=\"\">Thursday's police massacre</a> of 34 striking miners in South Africa.</p> <p>If it had happened under the old apartheid regime \u2013 as it did at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpeville_massacre\" title=\"\">Sharpeville in 1960</a> when 69 protesters died or the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soweto_uprising\" title=\"\">far bloodier student uprising</a> when 700 were killed in 1976 \u2013 there would have been sustained uproar around the world.</p> <p>On Friday morning it did not even lead BBC bulletins and was on only one front page I saw. Like many protests and demonstrations \u2013 in South Africa, in Britain and in most places \u2013 it didn't get much media attention until it turned nasty. It's a paradox to ponder \u2013 a dangerous one.</p> <p>But in this case surely the non-reporting problem would be exacerbated because the police shooting at the Marikana platinum mine in Rustenburg, north of Johannesburg, presented us with a narrative with which we were unfamiliar, uneasy even. It was a hark back to the bad old days of oppression by the white minority regime.</p> <p>For liberals, black majority rule was going to be the answer \u2013 it still is \u2013 so a grim setback to progress like this is unsettling. The South African Nobel laureate <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadine_Gordimer\" title=\"\">Nadine Gordimer</a> did not hesitate to speak out, but few are so bold or eminent.</p> <p>The massacre doesn't fit any of the familiar stereotypes into which media organisations struggle to slot the daily flow of news. If only it had happened in Damascus we'd all have known what to do, this year anyway. Last year we would have said: \"No, nothing like that happens in Syria, even in the Arab Spring. It can't be significant,\" or \"no, it's not on Reuters or in the New York Times\".</p> <p>In fact, the strike and its context sounds increasingly familiar as details start to trickle out. The 3,000 striking miners have been demanding a tripling of their 4,000-rand-a-month (\u00a3306) salary from Lonmin, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonmin\" title=\"\">the London-based mine owner</a>. It was formerly known as Lonrho (Tiny Rowlands was its boss) and is struggling to survive as well as close to breaching its debt limits, as world platinum prices plunge.</p> <p>That doesn't much matter to struggling miners and their families. Nationalise the mines, say young radicals such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/julius-malema\" title=\"\">Julius Malema</a>, the former African National Congress (ANC) youth leader who stirred the strikers' fervour in a speech to the vast crowd on Saturday. Jacob Zuma, current ANC leader and South African president, should resign too, Malema helpfully added. Not a smart thing to say at a time like this by a man already expelled for troublemaking.</p> <p>You can see why the Zuma administration was slow off the mark, even allowing for the sloth, corruption and aloofness that its critics allege with ever greater emphasis. Returning hastily from a foreign trip, Zuma has now declared a week of national mourning. He will no doubt deplore Lonmin's call on strikers to return to work or face the sack (the threat didn't seem to be working on Monday morning).</p> <p>But it's likely to prove too little too late. To the strikers, the traditional National Union of Mineworkers was judged to be too cautious. It was also deemed too close to the ANC, an old ally from the apartheid era, and along with Cosatu, the South African TUC, too cosy with the new black South African elite and its white business leadership, Lonmin included. No wonder Zuma said \"it's not the day to apportion blame\". He must hope the commission of inquiry will kick it into the elephant grass.</p> <p>It's an old story that you could probably hear near any deep mineshaft in the world. The reaction is fairly familiar too: a militant breakaway in the shape of the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union to which young miners \u2013 known as \"Born Frees\" for obvious reasons \u2013 flocked. The police defence is familiar too. The strikers were armed and angry, they had killed two policemen and an Lonmin official in recent days. It was a public order issue.</p> <p>True enough, up to a point. None of us would like to be surrounded by angry young men with machetes, guns and tribal loyalties. But the police were armed too, with automatic weapons. They had water cannon, horses, radio contact with a helicopter, always a threatening noise above any demo. And \u2013 as with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Sunday_(1972)\" title=\"\">Bloody Sunday</a> in Derry in 1972, 13 deaths that still reverberate \u2013 it's always a good test to count the dead on both sides.</p> <p>A striker may have fired first \u2013 as reported by a photographer \u2013 but there were no police fatalities in Thursday's three minutes of mayhem. Two successive police chiefs have been forced to resign over corruption and incompetence. The old \"shoot first, ask questions later\" culture of Sharpeville and Soweto lingers on.</p> <p>The wider context for the Marikana confrontation is growing disillusionment with the pace of progress 18 years after the ANC first took power under its hero, Nelson Mandela. Jobs, healthcare, housing, electricity supplies, sanitation and educational reform: more may have been expected than could quickly be delivered, but black voters see their own leaders \"meeting capitalists in air-conditioned offices\", as Malema put it.</p> <p>So strikes and protests have increased, not led by the ANC and the big unions, as in the apartheid era \u2013 such people are now in power \u2013 but by the young. Two million South Africans go on strike every year but it goes largely unreported, an expert warned on the radio. It's easy to see why, but it's also unhealthy.</p> <p>Do we \u2013 or the French media for that matter \u2013 do better? The riots last week in Toulouse and \u2013 much closer to Dover \u2013 in Amiens were manifestations of minority frustration, frequently staged but usually ignored. France is a country with a deeply rooted culture of street protest, the legacy of 1789. Britain too, albeit much less self-consciously.</p> <p>Dairy farmers <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18930618\" title=\"\">have been protesting lately</a> over poor to zero profit margins exacted by big supermarket chains. Did you know? In the past year, students have marched (with plenty of publicity) over fees, the unions over public spending cuts. Tanker drivers blockade petrol refineries and the TV crews turn up.</p> <p>But how much public support does that generate? I'm not sure. Many people judge such protests on their individual merits rather than leap instinctively to one side of the barricade or the other. That's what seems to be happening over Julian Assange's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/aug/19/julian-assange-takes-aim-us\" title=\"\">well-publicised battles</a>.</p> <p>And should there <em>always</em> be more coverage than is now fashionable to keep us all in touch with other people's gripes? It was a demo against the Tottenham police failure to explain why Mark Duggan had been shot during a surveillance operation that triggered last August's mix of protest and opportunistic riots. Did mainstream media coverage make things better or worse? Or does social media now dictate the pace?</p> <p>On a smaller canvas, the BNP and its fellow travellers on the far right routinely try to exploit racially charged controversy, not least over the <a href=\"http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1508280_three-arrested-as-far-right-groups-try-to-storm-rochdale-town-hall-in-protest-over-grooming-case\" title=\"\">Lancashire sex grooming cases,</a> which inspired a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01g986h\" title=\"\">startling two-parter</a> in BBC1's Silent Witness series. Such flare-ups are rarely reported beyond the locality and \u2013 as, the Guardian reports on Monday \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/19/far-right-fragmenting-bnp\" title=\"\">far right is currently fragmenting</a>. But it will be back. Should we hear more about such protests when (if) they have clearly become part of a wider trend?</p> <p>Surely it is always unhealthy to pretend things aren't happening when they are? On balance, I think we should, however unsettling or unsavoury they sometimes are.</p>",

  "<p>Let's say you want to convince an entire province that the pipeline you're planning to run through some of its most treasured natural areas is a great idea. Probably the last thing you'd want to do is suggest that you didn't know what those treasured natural areas look like. And, the chances are, if you did, you'd probably hope not many people heard about it or, say, spread it around on Facebook. Unfortunately for Enbridge, the company that hopes to run the Northern Gateway pipeline from northern Alberta to the Pacific coast of British Columbia, all of those things have happened. But it's just the latest misstep in the increasingly complicated domestic debate over Canada's oil sands.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.canada.com/technology/Federal+regulators+reveal+likely+cause+pipeline+rupture+that+caused/6909371/story.html\" title=\"\">17 hours it took</a> for someone to notice oil gushing from Enbridge's pipeline in Michigan last year was, along with everything else, a ticking PR time bomb. Now the company's due a geography lesson, as Facebookers in Canada will tell you, given the way its newest cock-up is trending. Everyone's sharing the <a href=\"http://www.vancouversun.com/news/thewest/Enbridge+sinks+islands+angers+critics/7099740/story.html\" title=\"\">corporate drawing</a> of the Douglas Channel leading from the Pacific ocean to Kitimat, BC. A waterway packed with 1,000 sq km of pointy islands was shown in an Enbridge presentation to be open water. Enbridge says it was only for \"illustrative purposes\". Illustrative indeed. Five thousand people shared it from <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=512865092063017&amp;set=a.207149739301222.67089.133690159980514&amp;type=3&amp;theater\" title=\"\">LeadNow</a>. Another couple thousand from activist <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151114161718874&amp;set=a.10151052776208874.452108.5794733873&amp;type=1&amp;theater\" title=\"\">David Suzuki</a>. Even before this, one cabinet minister <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/08/03/northern-gateway-james-moore-enbridge_n_1738534.html\" title=\"\">was already wary of Enbridge</a>. Now? Who knows. But that oil still needs to go somewhere.</p> <p>It was never supposed to be this way for the Conservatives, the jobs-and-growth crew from out west \u2013 the team that's never been afraid to extol the benefits of Alberta's oil, or encourage their political foes to go and see for themselves the progress being made up there. And why shouldn't they? That's their bag. The natural resources minister even went so far as to claim that soon you might just be able to <a href=\"http://www2.macleans.ca/2012/05/31/eau-de-tailing-pond/\" title=\"\">drink from tailings ponds</a>. We'll have to see about that. For now, there are pressing matters beyond just the fact that the oil sands are an <a href=\"http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2009/03/canadian-oil-sands/kunzig-text\" title=\"\">eyesore</a>, and beyond the charges about greenhouse gases, and allegations of <a href=\"http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCATRE51568020090206\" title=\"\">increased disease</a> floating downriver. A government can handle that, out-manoeuvering environmental concerns with political rhetoric. Now, though?</p> <p>It started with Keystone XL, that gigantic artery TransCanada plans to graft onto the landscape from Alberta to Texas. The one, we might remember, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-10/obama-administration-postpones-keystone-xl-pipeline-decision.html\" title=\"\">President Obama</a> delayed to make himself look like a job killer or a Marxist or whatever. Well, that's his problem. But we have our own. The government still wants to mine jobs that are, like the bitumen itself, potentially untapped, but that's only if they can move the product. At least we have the Chinese. <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/chinese-frustrated-by-northern-gateway-regulatory-delays/article545314/\" title=\"\">Maybe.</a> Prime minister Stephen Harper jetted over to <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2012/02/11/harper-china-saturday.html\" title=\"\">pick up some pandas</a> and whatever guarantees he could gather that the Chinese would take that oil \u2013 just as soon as we could get it to the west coast on the cheap.</p> <p>That's not going to be easy. The Northern Gateway pipeline, still at assessment stage, is now also the subject of a <a href=\"http://www.calgaryherald.com/news/sight+Alberta+Northern+Gateway+pipeline+feud+with/7091843/story.html\" title=\"\">battle</a> between British Columbia and Alberta over who will get the most money out of the whole thing. The royalty rules are clear, as far as Alberta knows, but BC premier Christy Clark is <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/1237092--poll-finds-popularity-of-b-c-liberal-party-slipping\" title=\"\">looking for a bump</a> in the pre-election polls, so she's scrambling around for some turf to steal from the New Democrats, who would stop it altogether. So Clark will ride the pipeline \u2013 conceivably, right into the ground. Or out of it, if it comes to that.</p> <p>Which brings us back to Enbridge, whose past keeps coming back to haunt it and, in turn, anyone interested in expanding overseas markets.</p> <p>And don't forget the Europeans, those socialists, who can't recapitalise their banks as quickly as we <a href=\"http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCABRE8550Q620120606\" title=\"\">want them</a> to. But never mind. Onward to the <a href=\"http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/eu-ue/can-eu.aspx?view=d\" title=\"\">free trade agreement</a> that we're told will bring more jobs and growth and prosperity for both sides of the Atlantic. Perhaps it will, and all the better for it. And yet, there will still be that northern Alberta oil, subject to fuel quality directives the Europeans will need met before they hand over their cash. They are <a href=\"http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/media-room/news-release/2012/30a/6062\" title=\"\">unfairly stigmatising</a>, we say. Germany's chancellor Angela Merkel danced around a question on it at a press conference Thursday. Yes, she and Harper talked about the fuel directives and the oil sands, she said. The Germans are familiar with the problems that exist.</p> <p>Yeah? Tell us about it.</p>",
  "<p>A disaster is about to hit the NHS, which I am the first to foresee. It is totally beyond our control. According to Time Magazine, <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2121086,00.html\" title=\"\">there is going to be a shortfall of 63,000 doctors</a> \u2013 mostly GPs \u2013 in America by 2015. I ask myself where the Americans are likely to make up this shortfall. The UK of course. So expect a massive exodus from these shores.</p> <p>Why this shortfall is likely to happen is that Obamacare (the Affordable Care Act) will bring healthcare to 32 million Americans, who previously were uninsured. The Association of American Medical Colleges reckons that 63,000 doctors are needed to cope with the extra demand, and that number is going to get higher.</p> <p>To make matters worse, despite the acute need the US federal funding for residential training has been frozen since 1996. There is already a shortage. So, even if they start now, there isn't time to train the 63,000 by 2015.</p> <p>Most of the doctors needed will be GPs. And here lies another problem. Time Magazine says, \"interest in becoming a primary care physician has plummeted; the field's gruelling hours and relatively low pay have given it a second class status\". Currently, students gravitate to more lucrative fields like plastic surgery and dermatology. Last week, I asked whether the doctors, depicted by Bernard Shaw in the Doctor's Dilemma, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2012/aug/13/have-doctors-changed-since-1906\" title=\"\">had changed their attitudes</a> much since it was written in 1906. It looks as if they may have emigrated, and are alive and well and living in the US! The structure of healthcare, after all, over there has changed much less since the early 1900s, than the UK since the creation of the NHS.</p> <p>So, unless, Mitt Romney and the Republicans are elected in November and throw out Obamacare, as he has promised to do, prepare for mass emigration of our best GPs over the next three years.</p> <p>It is hard to comprehend how so many Americans swallow the Tea Party line on dismissing Obamacare and would rather leave 32 million fellow Americans without any healthcare.</p> <p>The American right has always been perceived as religious. Whatever happened to the Christian virtues of charity and care for the poor and needy? Worse still, Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney's running mate, wants make it even more uncharitable, by dismantling Medicare, the support system for the elderly.</p> <p>Healthcare in America costs twice as much per head of population as in the UK. And despite this extra money, life-expectancy in the US is almost two years lower than in the UK.</p> <p>American doctors are very bright, the better hospitals are possibly more skilled than ours, and \u2013 as I do not tire pointing out \u2013 our NHS is frayed at the edges, but how can anybody justify morally or effectively the pre-Obama system under which their doctors work? That 63,000 extra doctors are needed to provide adequate national coverage is a condemnation in itself.</p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2012/jul/16/become-member-guardian-healthcare-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the Guardian healthcare network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>"
