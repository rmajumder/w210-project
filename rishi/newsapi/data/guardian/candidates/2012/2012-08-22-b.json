  "<p>Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, is enjoying a surge of popularity that could propel him to victory in the country's next elections, an independent poll of voters' intentions suggests.</p> <p>Mugabe would command the support of 31% of voters in a presidential election, ahead of rival Morgan Tsvangirai on 19%, <a href=\"http://www.freedomhouse.org/article/zimbabwe-opinion-survey-reveals-hope-elections-cynicism-about-political-leaders\" title=\"Zimbabwe Opinion Survey Reveals Hope for Elections, but Cynicism About Political Leaders\">according to research for the US-based pro-democracy group Freedom House</a>. Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) dismissed the results, noting that Mugabe's supporters were outnumbered by voters who refused to declare their intentions. But it is likely to boost the confidence of Mugabe's Zanu-PF party heading into elections expected next year.</p> <p>The Mass Public Opinion Institute polled a nationally representative sample of 1,198 adult Zimbabweans between 23 June and 7 July 2012, Freedom House said. When asked who they would vote for if presidential elections were held tomorrow, 31% say they would back Zanu-PF, an increase from just 12% in a 2009 survey. Alarmingly for the MDC, only 19% expressed support for the party, a dramatic fall from 55% three years ago. Other parties registered just 2%.</p> <p>However, some 40% of respondents did not declare their voting intentions, making it hard to draw categorical conclusions.</p> <p>Asked who they would support in parliamentary elections, 47% of respondents said they would not vote, or refused to indicate who they would vote for. Some 20% said they would support the MDC (down from 38% in 2010) and 31% would back Zanu-PF (up from 17% in 2010).</p> <p>The results come as a surprise because for years there has been a near default assumption by the MDC, activists and media that Mugabe's 32-year rule was drained of popular support and is sustained only by rigged elections and violence and intimidation. Freedom House's survey implies that the 88-year-old could yet make a political comeback and win.</p> <p>It also resonates with signs of discontent about the MDC's performance in the unity government it formed with Zanu-PF following the disputed election of 2008. The MDC took responsibility for departments such as education and health and has been criticised for slow delivery. Some observers argue that MDC ministers have fallen in love with their official cars and other trappings of power.</p> <p>Susan Booysen, author of the interim report Change and 'New' Politics in Zimbabwe for Freedom House, said she encountered complaints that the MDC had lost touch with grassroots constituencies, whereas Zanu-PF was still visible and fighting party political battles there.</p> <p>\"I've heard people saying MDC is just not doing work in the constituencies and is spending too much time in the palace,\" Booysen added. \"They're taking for granted they're the crown princes. They are not capturing the desire for change. And there is still a desire for change among people.\"</p> <p>The MDC questioned the validity of the study. Douglas Mwonzora, the party spokesperson, said in Harare: \"The party respects the right of individuals and institutions to carry out opinion surveys on the views of the people of Zimbabwe from time to time. However, we note that surveys carried out under current conditions are difficult to rely on due to the fact that they are held under conditions of major fluidity.</p> <p>\"We note that a lot of people interviewed refused to disclose their political preferences. This is obviously for fear of intimidation and the violence they have been subjected to by Zanu-PF and its military junta. This margin of terror fundamentally impugns the conclusion that can be derived from this report.\"</p> <p>A statement from the party added: \"The MDC reasserts that it is still the most popular party within Zimbabwe. That it has had a positive impact on the lives of the people of Zimbabwe since it formed the inclusive government can never be doubted.\"</p>",
  "<p>The worlds of politics and weather are combining as tropical storm Isaac is expected to turn into a hurricane and hit Florida in time for the Republican national convention next week. Let's first talk about Isaac, and then we'll look at the websites where you and I can follow storms for the upcoming season.</p> <p>Right now, Isaac is <a href=\"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT4+shtml/221451.shtml\">140 miles east of Guadeloupe</a>, and could strengthen into a hurricane by Thursday. Hurricane watches are out for the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.</p> <p>The National Hurricane Center's five-day <a href=\"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/refresh/graphics_at4+shtml/170607.shtml?tswind120#contents\">tropical storm wind probabilities</a> page illustrates the where Isaac should be turning next. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395069449\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/8/22/1345665804325/Tropical-storm-Isaac-001.jpg\" alt=\"Tropical storm Isaac\" width=\"460\" height=\"368\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graphic: National Hurricane Center</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: National Hurricane Center</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p></p> <p>The NHC currently puts the probability of tropical storm winds hitting Tampa in the next 5 days at 10% to 20%. That may seem low, but that is about as high as you will get this far out. The probability will go up as confidence in the storm track does.</p> <p>The NHC current forecast track gives reason to believe the probability will go up in Tampa.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395069450\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/8/22/1345666035479/Tropical-storm-Isaac-001.jpg\" alt=\"Tropical storm Isaac\" width=\"460\" height=\"368\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graphic: National Hurricane Center</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: National Hurricane Center</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p></p> <p>As you can see, the NHC believes the most likely path puts Isaac over the Gulf of Mexico south of Naples, Florida at 8am on Monday. Forecast maximum wind speeds are 80mph, good enough for a level 1 hurricane. </p> <p>But let's get into some more details.</p> <p>First, note that there is still a wide range in where Isaac could go. Right now the NHC has a track of anywhere well to the east to well to the west of Florida. The error cone is there because there is a spread in the hurricane models.</p> <p>I won't bore you with all the reasons for these track differences, but it mostly has to do with how the models view <a href=\"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCDAT4+shtml/221449.shtml\">mid-level ridging</a> in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The stronger (weaker) the ridge, an area defined by high pressure, the harder (easier) time the storm, an area of low pressure, will have at strengthening and coming north.</p> <p>Second, the winds <a href=\"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/refresh/graphics_at4+shtml/170607.shtml?table#contents\">are forecast</a> to be fierce, but nothing historic. It is not wise to mess with a hurricane, but 80mph is different from the 125mph with which Katrina hit New Orleans. Indeed, the probability that Isaac is not a hurricane (maximum winds of 74mph or greater) on Monday morning is 70%.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshws.php\">sort of damage</a> one expects from a category 1 \u2013 minor home damage, tree branches down, and power outages \u2013 is not likely something that would postpone a convention for any long stretch of time. Isaac's interactions with islands of the Caribbean combined with its relatively weak standing at the moment is not going to allow for major strengthening.</p> <p>Third, the timing for Isaac is Monday, not later in the week. Hurricanes can meander and the time for Isaac to hit near Tampa is uncertain. Yet, we have a pretty good handle that Monday seems a lot more likely than any other day during the week. In fact, the GFS already has Isaac well past Tampa by 8am on Monday.</p> <p>Hurricane damage such as downed trees and power outages can last until well after the storm has passed. A category 1 hurricane's winds are, however, less likely to have longer lasting effects. Rains can certainly create longer-term flooding problems. At this point, the rain forecasts are pointing towards some flooding, but not biblical-style problems.</p> <p>So what does this all mean for Isaac and the RNC right now?</p> <p>Isaac certainly threatens Florida. The timing of the storm is such that a delay in the start of convention is a possibility. The storm's strength and timing do not at this point suggest that Paul Ryan's nomination as vice-president on Wednesday or Mitt Romney's nomination on Thursday are likely to be interrupted by Isaac.</p> <p>But of course, storm tracks do change.

  "<p>There's no education in the second kick of a mule, as the former Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn used to say. Even the Republican party knows that, as we can observe from its <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/20/todd-akin-defiant-leaders-withdraw-support\">desperate efforts to oust Todd Akin</a> as its Senate candidate in Missouri.</p> <p>In an unprecedented display of party unity the GOP has been beseeching Akin to stand aside. It's a list that includes Rush Limbaugh, Tea Party super pacs, Ronald Reagan's cryogenically-preserved brain tissue (probably) and practically every Republican wandering past a microphone this week. When everyone from Mitt Romney to <a href=\"www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/79976.html\">Sarah Palin is calling for you to go</a>, you'd have to think something was up, right?</p> <p>The GOP has learned its lesson from the 2010 midterm elections. Then the Republicans were riding a wave of electoral popularity but failed to win the big prize of control of the Senate. That was thanks to Christine O'Donnell, Sharron Angle and Ken Buck \u2013 a trio of overinflated Tea Party-backed candidates who won their party's nomination but in doing so destroyed the GOP's otherwise excellent chances of capturing seats in Delaware, Nevada and Colorado.</p> <p>Nobody in the GOP wants to repeat its 2010 mule-kicking, of weak, inexperienced Senate candidates botching millions of dollars in effort. And the stakes are even higher in 2012 since a toxic Senate candidate such as Akin can infect the presidential campaign of Mitt Romney, as he threatens to do.</p> <p>But the potential 2012 damage isn't so much from Akin's views on abortion \u2013 since those are relatively mainstream within the Republican party's grassroots \u2013 as what he said about rape. And that's what Romney is desperate to distance himself from.</p> <p>Abortion of course remains a hugely <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/147734/Americans-Split-Along-Pro-Choice-Pro-Life-Lines.aspx\">controversial and divisive issue</a>. Rape isn't, even if there is an antediluvian dispute about what constitutes rape. </p> <p>Let's briefly revisit what Akin said when asked about his total opposition to abortion, including those of a pregnancy resulting from rape: \"If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.\" Apart from an incredible level of biological ignorance, the phrase that terrifies Mitt Romney and the rest of the Republican party there is \"legitimate rape\".</p> <p>Romney already has great difficulties with women voters and inheriting a Taliban-like position on what constitutes rape isn't going to help him. Hence Romney's vice presidential running mate <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/22/ryan-pressed-to-explain-position-on-rape-and-abortion/\">Paul Ryan responding to a question on the term \"forcible rape\"</a> used in an anti-abortion bill he endorsed: \"Rape is rape. Rape is rape, period. End of story.\" Asked again to explain the term, Ryan replied: \"Rape is rape and there's no splitting hairs over rape.\"</p> <p>This is a neat trick for the Romney campaign to pull off. They can come out vehemently against Akin and his comments on the subject of rape, while glossing over any inconvenience of his views on abortion \u2013 and the fact that they are largely shared, in more politic terms, by many others in the GOP.</p> <p>But that point hasn't been grasped by some Democrats and some members of the media, who think they have caught up the Republicans in a trap of hypocrisy, pointing out that the Republican party platform to be adopted at the national convention in Tampa <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/election/2012/08/21/718461/2012-republican-platform-to-advocate-abortion-ban-without-rape-exception/\">endorses a without-exception ban on abortion</a> and even calls for a constitutional amendment to end it entirely:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Faithful to the 'self-evident' truths enshrined in the Declaration of Independence, we assert the sanctity of human life and affirm that the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed. We support a human life amendment to the Constitution and endorse legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to unborn children.</p> </blockquote> <p>Indeed, <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/08/paul-ryan-cosponsored-all-most-extreme-anti-abortion-bills\">Paul Ryan himself supports complete abortion bans</a>, and said today that he was \"proud\" of his <a href=\"firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/08/22/13416844-ryan-backed-more-than-one-forcible-rape-abortion-bill\">record on the subject</a>. It's a position in line with the <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/147941/Republicans-Unified-Democrats-Abortion.aspx\">mainstream of the Republican party base</a>, two-thirds of which describe themselves as \"pro-life\". Republican party activists are even more enthusiastic on the issue. That's not to say that pro-choice Republicans don't exist: the BBC's Newsnight found one to discuss Akin's remarks on Tuesday, which is like finding a dodo to talk about Charles Darwin \u2013 interesting but beside the point. </p> <p>Outside the GOP base, however, a solid <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/148880/Plenty-Common-Ground-Found-Abortion-Debate.aspx\">majority of voters support abortion being legal</a> for at least some reasons, rape and the health of the mother being the most frequently expressed ones. The Romney campaign has aligned itself with mainstream public opinion to avoid repelling independent voters on the subject \u2013 an uncomfortable pragmatic position that feeds the mistrust social conservatives already have of Romney. Which is why his campaign wants to limit the discussion about Akin to rape rather than abortion.</p> <p>As for Akin, we now have the <a href=\"http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/claire-mccaskill-s-political-strategy-paying-off/article_a745c5b6-9eaf-5ba0-9e32-8af5603bf86a.html\">comic prospect of his being attacked on all sides</a> by Republicans while being supported by Claire McCaskill, his Democratic opponent, who knows that if he stays in the race her slim chances of holding her seat are improved. The St Louis Post-Dispatch reports that McCaskill went so far as to say: \"I take him at his word that he realised what he said was wrong. I honestly do have sympathy for him.\" And <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/10/071003151131.htm\">crocodiles cry when swallowing their prey</a>.</p> <p>That led to the utterly bizarre sight of Republicans attacking McCaskill for supporting <em>their</em> candidate. \"It should not be lost on anyone that some of the only voices not calling for Congressman Akin to do the right thing and step aside are Claire McCaskill and the leaders of the pro-abortion movement,\" fumed the Republican National Senatorial Committee in a statement that belongs in a parallel universe.</p> <p>Akin's calculation is that if he hangs on and the polls remain close in Missouri, then the rest of the GOP could be forced to come around and support him, because the prospect of winning a Senate seat is just too juicy for it to ignore. It didn't work for Christine O'Donnell in Delaware, but she was a crackpot with no political experience. Akin is a veteran congressman expressing a view on abortion that sits comfortably within the Republican mainstream.</p>",

Compass tries to follow the principle of being the change we wish to see in the world. This means that no matter the cause, the progressive left cannot deny, downplay or ridicule the seriousness of rape and sexual assault to treat women's bodies as collateral in some wider battle. Women's rights are not secondary to liberal or class politics, they are, and should be, placed at their heart.<br><strong>Ruth Lister</strong><em> Labour, House of Lords</em> <br><strong>Dr Purna Sen</strong> <em>LSE</em> <br><strong>Lee Chalmers</strong> <em>Leadership consultant</em> <br><strong>Rosie Rogers</strong> <em>National co-ordinator, Compass</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008George Galloway's attempts at clarification of his offensive video pronouncements on rape are both muddled and inept. He says \"nonconsensual sex is rape\". If a man has sex with a sleeping woman, he cannot have her consent. So on Galloway's own definition, that must be a rape. This is still more so when her consent to the original sex was allegedly subject to his using a condom, which this time he was not using. It would be interesting to know at which point, on Galloway's weird view of the law, the man's right of \"insertion\" during \"the sex game\" runs out.</p> <p>Galloway then asserts that \"Julian Assange \u2013 let's be clear \u2013 has always denied the allegations. And this has all the hallmarks of a setup. I don't believe, from what we know, that the director of public prosecutions would sanction a prosecution in Britain. What occurred is not rape as most people understand it. And it's important to note that the two women involved did not initially claim it.\"</p> <p>The fact that Assange denies the allegations does not mean that the allegations themselves, if proven, do not constitute a rape. It just means that he denies that he did what would otherwise constitute a rape. The fact that the women's account has changed does not mean that the present allegations do not constitute a rape. It just means that the present allegations are contradicted by earlier allegations, which may or may not be reason to doubt the veracity of the present allegations.</p> <p>Galloway's view of the DPP's view is as irrelevant as it is ill-informed. Most people would certainly believe that a man having unprotected sex with a sleeping woman when she has previously insisted upon the use of a condom is a rape, but their view is equally&#xa0;irrelevant. The frequent assertions that what happened would not constitute rape in the UK are simply wrong, but they are still being trotted out.</p> <p>Julian Assange may be innocent. I don't know. He may be being set up. I don't know that either. But these are matters for the Swedish legal process. He hasn't even been charged yet. What I do know is that a man protesting his innocence is not a complete defence to a crime. Still less is it a reason to assert that even if the allegations are proved, a crime never took place. <br><strong>Daphne Romney QC</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008The suggestion in your editorial that the comments made by Todd Akin have anything in common with those made by George Galloway is frankly disgraceful. Akin wants to deny access to abortion even in cases of rape. This constitutes a grave attack on women's rights. Galloway was pointing out that the law requires a jury to believe that a person accused of rape might reasonably doubt that consent had been given if it is to convict and that \u2013 in the circumstances that he described \u2013 there was, in his view, no reason for such doubt. There is no attack on anyone's rights here. <br><strong>Simon McKeown</strong><br><em>London</em></p>",
  "<p>The Federal Reserve is prepared to act \"fairly soon\" unless the economy shows substantially stronger growth, according to minutes of the Fed's last meeting.</p> <p>With the US recovery still looking fragile, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes, released after the customary three-week lag, show growing support for action.</p> <p>\"Many members judged that additional monetary accommodation would likely be warranted fairly soon unless incoming information pointed to a substantial and sustainable strengthening in the pace of the economic recovery,\" according to the minutes.</p> <p>At their previous meeting in June, only \"a few members\" thought further stimulus would likely be needed.</p> <p>Bernanke may give more details when he speaks on 31 August. His speech at an economics summit in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, will come a week before the latest non-farm jobs report is issued, a statistic that has become a barometer of President Barack Obama's political health in the 2012 election cycle.</p> <p>The minutes follow on from the Fed's statement at the start of the month when officials said the economy had \"decelerated somewhat\" over the first half of the year. In July the commerce department announced that US gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 the broadest measure of an economy's health \u2013 grew at 1.5% in the second quarter, down from 2% in the prior three months, and 4.1% in the fourth quarter of 2011.</p> <p>Many economists predict that the Fed is likely to announce any action after its September meeting. With the economy still the central battleground of the election, Fed action is likely to trigger a political backlash. Republicans have already pressed Fed chairman Ben Bernanke to refrain from further action.</p> <p>\"The truth is the Federal Reserve cannot rescue Americans from the consequences of failed economic and regulatory policies passed by Congress and signed by the president,\" said the House financial services committee chairman representative Spencer Bachus, told Bernanke last month at a congressional hearing.</p> <p>The US economy appears to be in a tepid recovery with slowly improving jobs numbers and improvements in its devastated housing market. But since its June meeting, Fed officials noted, economic activity had slowed. Most policymakers agreed that \"economic growth was likely to remain moderate over coming quarters and then pick up gradually\" and that the unemployment rate would decline only slowly.</p> <p>With interest rates still close to all time lows, Fed officials are likely to choose a third massive round of bond buying \u2013 known as quantitative easing \u2013 in order to stimulate the economy.</p> <p>\"Many participants expected that such a program could provide additional support for the economic recovery both by putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and by contributing to easier financial conditions more broadly,\" the minutes stated.</p> <p>Dissent remains, however, with some FOMC members questioning the \"possible efficacy of such a program under present circumstances\" and concerned about its impact on the Fed's balance sheet.</p> <p>The minutes came after the Congressional Budget Office said the US was facing a budget deficit of over $1tn for the fifth straight year. The CBO also warned, as has Bernanke, that political squabbling over so-called \"fiscal cliff\", the expiration of year end tax breaks and imposition of draconian spending cuts, could push the economy back into a \"significant recession\" unless a resolution is found.</p> <p>David Semmens, senior US economist at Standard Chartered, said the minutes \"paint a picture of a committee more open to easing than the market was anticipating\". But he said the minutes were a snapshot and that economic data had improved since they were taken.</p>",
  "<p>Embattled Republican candidate Todd Akin hinted Wednesday for the first time that he might yet bow to the pressure to resign over the rape row that is putting at risk party hopes of taking control of the US Senate in November and disrupting its White House campaign.</p> <p>Akin, in an early morning interview with ABC, insisted he was staying in the race because he is uncomfortable with party bosses dictating who should run. But, asked whether he might yet quit, he said: \"I'm never going to say everything that could possibly happen. I don't know the future.\"</p> <p>The row over Akin's \"legitimate rape\" remark is wrecking carefully laid plans by Mitt Romney in the run-up to the Republican convention in Tampa, Florida, next week.</p> <p>Campaign speeches by Romney and his vice-presidential running-mate Paul Ryan on the economy, proposed defence cuts and other issues have been lost amid the Akin row and, to a lesser extent, revelations about a skinny-dipping Republican congressman on a fact-finding trip to Israel.</p> <p>Professor Michael McDonald, an election specialist at George Mason University, said the Republicans had been in a position to make lots of gains in the senate in 2010 but chose Tea Party candidates such as Christine O'Donnell and lost. \"This time what do we see but Akin shoot himself in the foot. It is like the Republicans do not want to win,\" McDonald said.</p> <p>New polls show Romney gained no bounce from his announcement of Ryan as his running mate and that he is running neck-and-neck with Obama. On top of that, weather forecasters are warning that tropical storm Isaac could hit Tampa next week as a hurricane .</p> <p>Akin has rejected calls by Romney, Ryan and other senior Republicans to resign as candidate in Missouri after saying in a television interview on Sunday that \"legitimate rape\" rarely leads to pregnancy, a comment that opened the way for the Democrats to renew their accusations that the Republicans are fighting a war on women.</p> <p>Republican leaders are hoping that Akin will quit if polls show a drop in support in Missouri or his hopes of funding from small donors fail to materialise. Brian Walsh, a spokesman for the Republican senatorial campaign committee, calling on him to go, said the stakes are far bigger than any one individual.</p> <p>William Kristol, the conservative writer who predicted Romney would choose Ryan, wrote in his Weekly Standard blog that Akin had given plenty of indications that he remained open to leaving the field and it was time for those close to Akin to persuade him to stand down.</p> <p>\"I have reason to believe that's now beginning to happen behind the scenes.

The Republicans have controlled the House since the November 2010 election and are four seats short of winning control of the Senate. Control of both chambers would allow the Republicans to throw up a series of obstacles to Obama if he was to win a second term and provide a powerful base for pushing Romney, should he win the White House, to the right.</p> <p>The Democrats have a majority of 53 to 47 over the Republicans in the Senate. There are only 33 of the 100 Senate races up for grabs in November, and most of these are safe. Only a handful are in contention, hence the importance of Missouri. After Missouri, the most vulnerable Democratic-held seats, according to political analysts, are Montana, Florida, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin. And it is not just a matter of Republicans taking seats but holding ones they already have, such as Massachusetts, held by Republican Scott Brown but traditionally a Democratic stronghold.</p> <p>Brown, along with other Republicans who see the row as damaging was among the first to call for him to resign and his Democratic opponent, Elizabeth Warren, issued an ad highlighting the issue Wednesday.</p> <p>Political analysts predict that if Akin remains, it will be make what should be an easy Republican victory in Missouri difficult, with some saying he is unelectable. But others see Missouri as one of the most deeply conservative states in the country, with a high proportion of Christian evangelicals and home-schoolers, and noted that initial polls showed support holding for Akin. <br>Street interviews with residents also showed a willingness to forgive him.</p> <p>Larry Sabato, professor of politics at University of Virginia, who correctly predicted Akin would not quit straight away, expects him to leave soon. \"My sense is he needs time to decompress and adjust. He was not just the candidate but likely to have been the next senator,\" Sabato said.</p> <p>He added: \"This was poorly timed for the convention. Romney and Ryan had wanted to talk about the economy. They are talking about abortion and rape. They did not plan on that.\"</p> <p>As long as Akin is in place, the issue will haunt the Republicans, in particular Ryan, whose stance on rape and abortion is similar \u2013 he is opposed to abortion even in cases of rape or incest.</p> <p>In an interview with KDKA, a CBS affiliate in Pittsburgh, Ryan denounced Akin's comments as outrageous.

  "<p>Palestinian leaders have accused Israel of interfering in internal Palestinian affairs and launching \"a deliberate campaign of distortion, hatred and incitement\", after the Israeli foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, called for elections to replace the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas.</p> <p>In a letter to EU foreign policy chief, Lady Ashton, and other members of the Middle East quartet, Lieberman accuses Abbas of heading \"a despotic government riddled with corruption\" and \"personally acting to undermine attempts to renew the peace process, despite Israeli gestures and confidence building measures.\"</p> <p>Lieberman accuses Abbas of having a \"weak standing\" among his own people and being \"uninterested or unable \u2026 to reach an agreement which would bring an end to the conflict\".</p> <p>\"General elections in the PA [Palestinian Authority] should be held, and a new, legitimate, hopefully realistic Palestinian leadership should be elected,\" Lieberman writes.</p> <p>The letter, dated 20 August, was published on Wednesday by the Israeli daily Haaretz, sparking a storm of protest from Palestinian officials.</p> <p>Abbas spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeineh described the text as \"incitement\" liable to create an \"atmosphere of violence and instability\".</p> <p>\"Lieberman's comments regarding elections in the PA constitute meddling in internal Palestinian affairs,\" he added.</p> <p>Hanan Ashrawi, an executive committee member of the PLO, which handles diplomatic contacts with Israel, said the letter demonstrated Israel's \"arrogance, manipulation of facts, and outright racism. Rather than complying with international law and signed agreements, the Israeli government has launched a deliberate campaign of distortion, hatred and incitement.\"</p> <p>Israel has complained previously about Abbas's refusal to restart peace talks over the continued expansion of Israeli settlements, but he has always been described as a potential peace partner.</p> <p>Officials representing Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu swiftly distanced him from his foreign minister's remarks. An aide to Netanyahu told the Guardian that the prime minister was not aware of the letter before it was sent.</p> <p>\"The letter by the foreign minister does not reflect the view of the prime minister, nor of the government as a whole,\" said the official. \"Palestinian president Abbas has created difficulties preventing the restarting of negotiations, but Israel nevertheless remains committed to continuing to try to engage with the Palestinians and of course we don't interfere in the election cycles of others.\"</p> <p>Observers of Israel's byzantine coalition politics said it was possible that the letter was released for internal political purposes, to boost the government's rightwing credentials and domestic popularity ahead of an imminent general election.</p> <p>\"This letter was not written overnight,\" said Gerald Steinberg, professor of politics at Bar-Ilan University. \"The letter says very explicitly what Lieberman has been saying to Israeli audiences, and what many Israelis believe. Lieberman has often played the role of saying things that Netanyahu may think but as prime minister is reluctant to say.\"</p> <p>But Steinberg also recalled that differences between prime ministers and foreign ministers are a long-standing Israeli tradition.</p> <p>\"This is very much part of Israel's political system,\" he said. \"The most blatant example was when Shimon Peres as foreign minister promoted the Oslo peace process behind the back of the prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin.\"</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/power-women/list/\" title=\"\">Forbes magazine's annual list of the 100 most powerful women on the planet</a> is long on politicians, philanthropists and entertainers, but short on influential Britons, with just the Queen and JK Rowling making this year's cut.</p> <p>Leading the list for the second year running is the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, followed by the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, the Brazilian president, Dilma Rousseff, and Melinda Gates, co-chair of the foundation that bears her name and that of her husband, Bill.</p> <p>The magazine \u2013 which refers to Merkel as the \"'Iron Lady' of Europe and the lead player in the eurozone economic drama that continues to threaten global markets\" \u2014 notes her embracing of the internet, green credentials and high public approval ratings in the run-up to next year's general election.</p> <p>Clinton, meanwhile is praised for her commitment to her job \u2013 \"this year alone she's travelled to 42 countries\" \u2013 her handling of the WikiLeaks cable crisis, and her uncompromising attitude.</p> <p>\"In November, [Clinton] urged Syrian President Bashar Assad to hand over his power and leave his country, and recently warned North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to chart a different course than his militant father,\" says Forbes. The magazine said supporters were still hopeful of Clinton making a presidential bid, despite her stated determination to move out of public life at the end of the year.</p> <p>Rousseff earns her place for her ambitious plans and programmes \"aimed at eradicating dire poverty and increasing access to education, medical care and sanitation services to those in need by 2014\". The politician, whose popularity stood at 77% two months ago, tells the magazine: \"What I want my legacy to be is this country to be increasing middle class, to be highly competitive and highly educated.\"</p> <p>Next up is Gates, who has used her money and influence to challenge the Vatican over its position on birth control.</p> <p>The first lady of the US comes in seventh place on the list, below Jill Abramson, executive editor of the New York Times, and Sonia Gandhi, the longest serving president of the Indian National Congress party.</p> <p>\"More popular than her husband in this important election year, Michelle Obama's positive approval ratings register at 66%,\" says Forbes. \"The first lady keeps a high profile with her mission to end childhood obesity, her commitment to military families and her stylish fashion picks.\"</p> <p>Hovering just outside the top 10 \u2013 whose remaining spots are claimed by Christine Lagarde of the IMF, the US homeland security secretary, Janet Napolitano, and Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook \u2013 is \"the Queen of Media\" Oprah Winfrey.</p> <p>She is far from the only cultural force to find Forbes recognition: Winfrey's friend Lady Gaga occupies 14th spot, a tribute to both her $52m earnings last year and her philanthropic work.</p> <p>Beyonce Knowles, \"actress, entrepreneur, musician\", is 18 places behind Gaga, but six places ahead of Jennifer L\u00f3pez and eight ahead of the Colombian singer-songwriter and philanthropist Shakira.</p> <p>The Queen is at No 26. \"She has been commemorating her 60th diamond Jubilee anniversary with parades, parties and by making peace throughout the realm,\" notes Forbes. \"In June she shook hands with former IRA commander Martin McGuinness during a visit to Northern Ireland that was seen as a symbol of significant easing of tensions in British-Irish relations. In lighter but similarly symbolic news the iconic clock tower of Britain's parliament building \u2013 widely, though incorrectly called Big Ben \u2013 was renamed in her honour this summer. It will be known as Elizabeth Tower.\"</p> <p>In the final quarter of the list, occupying 78th spot, is JK Rowling, soon to publish her \"first adult offering, a dark comedy titled The Casual Vacancy\".

  "<p>US home sales and prices rose moderately in July amid signs that the worst housing crisis in living memory may be coming to an end.</p> <p>According to the National Association of Realtors (NAR) existing home sales rose 2.3% to an annual rate of 4.47m units last month, a figure just below analysts' expectations. The median price for a home resale nationwide was $187,300 (\u00a3118,500) in July, 9.4% higher than in the same month a year earlier.</p> <p>\"Mortgage interest rates have been at record lows this year,\" said NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun. He said that low rates combined with signs of improvement in the job market were \"helping to unleash pent-up demand\".</p> <p>The collapse of the housing market is seen by economists as the most significant drag on the wider US economy. On Monday President Barack Obama said there were signs it was \"beginning to tick up\" again. But it remains extremely weak in states including Florida that are vital to his re-election campaign.</p> <p>Housing expert David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, said the news was \"encouraging\". Last month the S&amp;P Case Shiller home price index reported US home prices rose 2.2% in May over April.</p> <p>\"This is one more piece of data that suggest the recovery is for real,\" he said.

Lending criteria were tightened massively after the housing boom exposed shoddy practices across the industry. He said it now appeared that lending was moving back toward more normal standards.</p>",
  "<p>Silly me. I dared to feel a moment of hope this week, after the idiotic Missouri congressman and senatorial candidate Todd Akin, while discussing abortion rights and why nobody should have them, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/aug/20/missouri-todd-akin-legitimate-rape-abortion-video\" title=\"\">insisted that \"legitimate rape\", as he put it, rarely leads to pregnancy</a>.</p> <p>His fellow Republicans remarkably hastened to distance themselves from the ignoramus, and urged him to drop out of the senate race. The Republican National Committee <a href=\"http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2012/08/21/rnc-chair-says-akin-should-drop-out-funding-has-been-pulled/\" title=\"\">went so far as to pull funding</a> from his campaign. I dared hope Akin would prove the darkness before the dawn, the moment America's right wing would collectively snap out of it and cry: \"What happened? We've hit rock bottom! Republicans are supposed to be the party of small government, personal liberty and fiscal responsibility, remember? Not the haven for theocrats, science deniers and constant smouldering outrage at the thought of consenting adults engaging in non-procreative sexual activity!\"</p> <p>Nope. Turns out Republicans don't disagree with Akin's abortion views so much as deplore his discussing them in public. The first rule of the Medieval-Flavored Misogyny Club is don't talk about the Medieval-Flavored Misogyny Club, especially not a couple of days before GOP conventioneers announce their extremist anti-abortion plank in this year's campaign platform.</p> <p>As James Hohmann <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/79945.html\" title=\"\">reported</a> for Politico:</p> <blockquote> \"Even as Mitt Romney sought to quash the furor surrounding Todd Akin's 'legitimate' rape comments, the Republican platform committee [in Tampa, Florida] approved an abortion plank that includes no exemptions for rape, incest or even to save the life of the mother. <br>\"The platform committee instead approved draft language Tuesday, calling for a 'Human Life Amendment' that gives legal protection to the unborn.\" </blockquote> <p><em>Even to save the life of the mother</em>. The anti-abortion brigades need to quit calling themselves \"pro-life\" when they're clearly \"pro-forced gestation\", because there's nothing remotely pro-life about telling a pregnant woman, \"better you die in childbirth than live childfree\". Don't mistake me for some bleeding-heart liberal, here. I've no inherent objection to the death penalty; I concur that certain actions are so evil that whoever commits them deserves death by command of the state. I just don't think being a woman with an ectopic pregnancy qualifies.</p> <p>Forced-gestation supporters never explicitly say, \"I want to control women's sexuality\". Their justification for urging pregnant rape victims to give birth, or ordering women with life-threatening pregnancies to literally drop dead, is that once the sperm hits the ovum, the resulting zygote is equal to you and me and has a right not to be aborted identical to our right not to be murdered.</p> <p>And suppose the forced gestationists are correct, and a microscopic zygote really does deserve the same legal rights as us. Would that justify banning abortions for pregnancies that can be carried to term without killing the mother? No. Even if embryos have rights identical to yours and mine, we don't have the right to demand another person's body or biological functions be used to sustain our own. Imagine you need a bone marrow or liver transplant and only one person is a compatible donor for you. Have you the right to force her to donate against her will? Can you compel another to suffer pain for your benefit? Demand a woman submit to invasive procedures on her body, if necessary to keep yours alive? Commandeer the use of all her biological systems for the greater part of a year? Of course not. You can't even force your own mother to do this. But the GOP thinks you should \u2013 at least until the umbilical cord is cut.</p> <p>Do Republicans really think this will win them the election? I'm only half-joking when I wonder if the GOP's been commandeered by secret-agent Democrats aiming to make Obama the lesser of two evils, no matter how terrible a president he is. Many Americans like me, who voted for Obama in 2008, were soon dismayed to see that on multiple civil liberties issues (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/apr/18/tsa-mission-creep-us-police-state\" title=\"\">TSA</a>, government transparency, whistleblower punishment, drug war, drone wars, warrantless surveillance et al), he's measurably worse than Bush. Obama makes me yearn for the freedom I enjoyed under vice president Cheney and before 2009, I figured only powerful hallucinogens could ever do that. Had the GOP nominated some sane, moderate, pro-liberty candidates \u2013 <a href=\"http://jon2012.com/\" title=\"\">Jon Huntsman</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Johnson\" title=\"\">Gary Johnson</a>, perhaps \u2013 they might've had a real chance of overcoming Obama's incumbent's advantage and retaking the White House this November.</p> <p>Instead, they gave us candidates identical to Obama on every major civil liberty issue, save the two issues where they're even worse: \"You know what's really wrong with America? Too many gay people getting married, and too many straight women having sex. Vote Republican. We'll fix <em>them.</em>\"</p>",
  "<p>Most dramatists would kill to have a play revived every few years. One solution is to write an imperishable masterpiece; even better if it becomes a set text on the school or university syllabus. But a more reliable method is to choose a subject that excites cyclical interest \u2013 a tactic demonstrated by the late <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/gore-vidal\" title=\"\">Gore Vidal</a>.</p> <p>Vidal, who died last month, was always better known for novels, essays, screenplays, quips and controversies. But he also created a few pieces for the stage, and a new production of his 1960 drama The Best Man has been <a href=\"http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117947336\" title=\"\">playing at the Schoenfeld Theatre in New York</a> throughout the summer. Impressively, this is the second Broadway staging in just over a decade.</p> <p>Never short of self-confidence, Vidal would attribute the popularity of The Best Man to the brilliance of the script. But, while it does display the writer's remarkable facility with one-liners, its durability is down to the fact that it's set during a presidential nominating convention in an American general election year. As a result, every time Americans are choosing their next president, the play has come to tick the box for New York, Los Angeles or regional theatres. \"It gets done somewhere every four years without fail,\" Vidal once told me in an interview.</p> <p>It helps that \u2013 because the competitive psychologies and even policies of US politics have changed surprisingly little since the 1960s \u2013 The Best Man hasn't dated, although successive directors have added subtle period tweaks. In the current Broadway staging, for instance, the character of a former president (whom Vidal based on Eisenhower) is played by an African-American actor, James Earl Jones, which adds an Obama, or even post-Obama, spin to the plot.</p> <p>As Vidal had always hoped would be the case, he turns out to have written a theatrical equivalent of pop songs such as Slade's Merry <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6YbLZf8i5I\" title=\"\">Xmas Everybody</a>, which will have an excuse for revival as long as Christmas continues to take place. Admittedly, Slade went three better than Vidal and wrote something likely to be revisited annually rather than just quadrennially. The closest we have to a Slade-like play is Alan Ayckbourn's 1980 play Season's Greetings, which takes place during a disastrous family Christmas, and so is always bound to be found at at least one UK playhouse each year as a distraction from people's own festive hostilities. The brilliant <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-reviews/8191521/Seasons-Greetings-National-Theatre-review.html\" title=\"\">National Theatre version</a> at the end of 2010 \u2013 with a cast including Catherine Tate and Mark Gatiss \u2013 will surely have further encouraged its status as a perennial.</p> <p>With Vidalesque canniness, Ayckbourn has also written another seasonally themed piece \u2013 Absurd Person Singular (1972), which takes place over three Christmas eves \u2013 and, even though the Chichester revival this summer runs counter to the calendar, the production must make a tempting potential winter transfer to London. Despite writing 74 plays, though, Ayckbourn has so far avoided an Easter-specific piece. Perhaps the anonymous mediaeval authors of the mystery plays have first claim on that part of the theatrical year.</p> <p>A combination of dramatic genius, British examination syllabuses and the existence of the RSC mean that there will be a Shakespeare play in the UK on somewhere most days. But our national dramatist also has two seasonally topical plays among his output. A Midsummer Night's Dream is regularly to be found being performed outdoors by meteorologically optimistic theatre companies on or around 24 June, officially the middle of summer. And Macbeth, in which Shakespeare was perhaps most preoccupied with political and supernatural ideas, has become symbolic of Scottishness, and therefore a default choice for companies visiting the Edinburgh festival; the 2012 fringe programme lists <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/aug/12/macbeth-2008-tr-warszawa\" title=\"\">five direct stagings</a> and several more allusive variations.</p> <p>Festival Macbeths have become such a lazy reflex that a moratorium would seem to be called for. Other cyclical flowerings, though, are more welcome: Season's Greetings is the perfect adult pantomime. And it's perhaps some consolation for the loss of Gore Vidal that \u2013 unless his prediction of a future American president suspending democracy proves to be accurate \u2013 The Best Man will be a part of every election cycle.</p>",

His decision to stay on will be viewed with dismay by senior members of the Republican party.</p> <p>Speaking live on the Mike Huckabee radio show on Tuesday, Akin said that he had received a large amount of support from small, grassroots supporters, including donations, and this helped counter-balance withdrawal of support from Republican leaders. \"I just misspoke one word in one sentence on one day,\" Akin said. Akin had claimed women's bodies can prevent pregnancies in cases of \"legitimate rape\".</p> <p>An unusual coalition of senior and grassroots Republicans has been making a concerted effort to get him to quit, including Tea Party groups, some of which helped Akin secure victory in the primary last week.</p> <p>Under state election law, Akin would have faced no financial penalties if he had pulled out by 6pm ET on Tuesday, and the party would be free to pick an alternative. The next date for withdrawal would be 25 September, but that would require a court order to allow him leave the race. </p> <p>Leaving it until September could also mean he would face significant financial penalties, such as reimbursing the cost of reprinting ballot papers or other election material.</p> <p>But the Republicans' difficulties on abortion are unlikely to go away. On Tuesday, as the leadership turned up the heat on Akin, the party approved language in its platform calling for a constitutional amendment banning abortion with no explicit exemptions in cases of rape and incest.</p> <p>Meanwhile, another Republican congressman, Steve King of Iowa, inflamed the row, defending Akin and suggesting that he'd never heard of a woman getting pregnant from statutory rape or incest. </p> <p><a href=\"http://2012.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/08/steve-king-statutory-rape.php\">Talking Points Memo</a> on Monday reported that King told Iowa radio station KMEG-TV reported him saying: \"Well I just haven't heard of that being a circumstance that's been brought to me in any personal way and I'd be open to discussion about that subject matter.\" </p> <p>The controversy has also <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/20/paul-ryan-pro-life-akin\">focused attention on the anti-abortion views</a> of Romney's running mate, Paul Ryan. </p> <p>The Missouri seat held by McCaskill is regarded by Republicans as the top target in the campaign to take control of the Senate. McCaskill, who has used the row to portray Akin as an extremist, is urging him to stay in the race. </p> <p>The Republican Senate campaign committee and conservative Super Pacs have withdrawn about $10m in financial support for Akin. The last remaining hope for Akin is to attract donations from individual donors. </p> <p>If Akin eventually quits, he could be replaced either by Jim Brunner, a businessman who came second in the primary with 30% \u2013 6% behind Akin \u2013 or Sarah Steelman, a former state treasurer, who took 29%. Brunner has already been sounding out party members about replacing Akin.</p> <p>Public Policy Polling, in a survey conducted on Monday night, showed the row has not had any significant impact on voting intentions yet. Akin is leading McCaskill 44% to 43%, almost unchanged from May when he was ahead 45% to 44%.</p> <p>It may be that the poll was conducted too soon to fully register any unease with Akin.</p> <p>As well as possible repercussions for the Senate race, Democrats also see Akin as useful in highlighting differences between the Obama-Biden ticket and the Romney-Ryan ticket on abortion. </p> <p>In the light of the row, there will be pressure to change the draft to include exceptions for rape and incest.</p>",

It wants to comply with a court request that Assange should be sent to Sweden for questioning. Assange's supporters have tried to discredit the allegations, saying they are part of a plot to extradite him to the US.</p> <p>Senior politicians in Ecuador have implied much the same. Correas added his voice but said the case needed to be answered. \"I don't want to judge allegations that have not been proven and would not, in any case, be considered a felony in Latin American, too,\" he said. \"It has never been the intention of the Ecuadorean government for Julian Assange not to respond to those allegations.\"</p> <p>Ecuador has proposed interrogations by Swedish investigators on embassy property and has said it would support Assange going to Sweden if it could get reassurances from the UK government that he would not then be extradited to the US.</p> <p>Critics say this is grandstanding for domestic political reasons. Correa \u2013 already Ecuador's longest serving president for a century \u2013 will contest an election early next year. Although his support rates are high, one of his least popular moves has been to assert greater control over the media through lawsuits, referenda and closures of radio stations. Providing a haven for Assage \u2013 a champion of whistleblowers \u2013 may be designed to offset these negative perceptions.</p> <p>During the Q&amp;A on Tuesday Correa addressed this issue and defending an offensive against TV, radio and print. \"Don't let yourself be fooled by what's going. There is this image of the media as being about Woodward and Bernstein and Watergate and the struggle for freedom of expression. But that isn't the case here.\" </p> <p>The reality, he said, was more like the the novel Pantanle\u00f3n y las Visitadoras by Mario Vargas Llosa. \"Instead of grabbing the news they are blackmailing people. The press in Latin America is totally corrupt,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>One of Africa's most powerful and divisive leaders, Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia, has died of an undisclosed illness, raising fears of a regional power vacuum.</p> <p>David Cameron was among the world leaders who paid tribute to Meles, a towering political figure who shaped modern Ethiopia in his own image. The country is now one of Africa's fastest-growing economies and among the United States' closest allies on the continent. But human rights groups condemned Meles as an authoritarian strongman whose 21-year rule was marred by rigged elections and the persecution, imprisonment and torture of critics.</p> <p>Meles, 57, died in a hospital in Brussels on Monday after contracting an infection, authorities said. The prime minister had not been seen in public for about two months, and speculation about his health increased after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/08/ethiopia-meles-zenawai-not-seen\" title=\"\">he failed to attend a meeting of African Union heads of state in the capital, Addis Ababa, last month</a>.</p> <p>Thousands of mourning Ethiopians descended on the centre of the Addis Ababa as his body was flown back from Brussels.</p> <p>His demise raises the prospect of political turmoil in Africa's second most populous country. Kenya's prime minister, Raila Odinga, said: \"One fears for the stability of Ethiopia upon his death, because you know that the Ethiopian state is fairly fragile and there is a lot of ethnic violence \u2026 I don't know that [Ethiopian politicians] are sufficiently prepared for a succession: this is my fear \u2013 that there may be a falling out within the ruling movement.\"</p> <p>Hailemariam Desalegn, 47, appointed deputy prime minister and foreign affairs minister in 2010, will be sworn in as prime minister after an emergency meeting of parliament, said Bereket Simon, the communications minister. On Tuesday, state TV showed pictures of Meles against a soundtrack of classical music. Thousands of mourners thronged outside the airport in Addis Ababa as they awaited Meles's coffin, some holding portraits of the late prime minister and placards that said \"We will continue what you have begun.\" Groups of women dropped to the ground ululating and sobbing.</p> <p>One mourner, Rosa Betemariam, who had been living and working as a dental nurse in the US, said: \"I am devastated. I am visiting Ethiopia after not having been home for 20 years. I am overcome by joy and sadness. I am so sad at his passing but also amazed at what Meles has done for this country. I cannot recognise this city. His vision as a leader has transformed Ethiopia.\"</p> <p>Sitting in a khat bar, where people chew the narcotic leaf, Abraham Getachew, an engineering student, said: \"As a human being, I am upset at the news of his death. But I am not sad that we have lost him as a leader. We do not feel that we have benefited from his leadership. Seventy per cent of students cannot find employment. We want to play a part in the development of Ethiopia but we have not been afforded this opportunity.\"</p> <p>There were numerous tributes from within Africa and beyond. The African Union, which is headquartered in Addis Ababa, said: \"The death of Prime Minister Meles has robbed Africa of one of its greatest sons.\" Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said: \"Meles Zenawi was an economic transformer, he was a strong intellectual leader for the continent.\"</p> <p>Cameron described Meles as \"an inspirational spokesman for Africa\" on global issues. \"His personal contribution to Ethiopia's development, in particular by lifting millions of Ethiopians out of poverty, has set an example for the region,\" the British prime minister said.</p> <p>The US viewed Meles as a strong security partner in the war on militant Islamism and has given hundreds of millions of dollars in aid over the years. US military drones that patrol east Africa, especially over Somalia, are stationed in Ethiopia. At the end of 2006, Somalia's UN-backed government asked Ethiopia to send troops into Somalia to try to put down an Islamist insurgency. Ethiopian troops moved in and captured Mogadishu, but the Somali population rebelled against what it saw as an occupation and Ethiopian forces withdrew in 2009.</p> <p>Ethiopia again sent troops to Somalia in early 2012 as part of an increased international effort to pressure the al-Qaida affiliated group al-Shabaab.</p> <p>On Tuesday al-Shabaab welcomed Meles's death. \"We are very glad about Meles's death. Ethiopia is sure to collapse,\" spokesman Sheikh Ali Mohamud Rage told Reuters.</p> <p>Human rights groups have long denounced Meles's government for its use of arbitrary detention, torture and surveillance of opposition members. Under a 2009 anti-terror law more than 100 opposition figures have been arrested; the government insists it is tackling rebel groups that have links with al-Qaida and Eritrea. More than 10 journalists have also been charged under the law, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.</p> <p>Claire Beston, Amnesty International's Horn of Africa researcher, said: \"The 21 years of Meles Zenawi's rule were characterised by ever-increasing repression and widespread human rights violations. \"His government stamped out dissenting voices, dismantled the independent media, obstructed human rights organisations and strangled political opposition.\"</p> <p>She added: \"Ethiopia's jails are packed to the seams with suspected political opponents - from urban intellectuals to rural farmers. Torture and ill-treatment are commonplace. State resources, assistance and opportunities have been broadly used to control the population. Tens of thousands of Ethiopians were forced to flee the country during his rule.\"</p> <p>Critics saw Meles as paying only lip service to democracy. Opposition members accused him of rigging the 2005 election and, when demonstrations broke out, security forces killed at least 200 people and jailed thousands. Almost the entire leadership of an opposition group that won an unprecedented number of seats in parliament was jailed for life for treason.</p> <p>In 2010, Meles won a further five years in office while receiving a reported 99% of the vote in an election that the US and other international observers said did not meet international standards.</p> <p>Meles' legacy will be debated. Under him, Ethiopia recorded improvements in education with the construction of new schools and universities. Women gained more rights. In the mid-2000s Ethiopia experienced strong growth, tripling in size in 15 years, which won Meles plaudits. The International Monetary Fund in 2008 said Ethiopia's economy had grown faster than any non-oil exporting country in sub-Saharan Africa.</p> <p>But many Ethiopians complain that his close business ties with China did not translate into more jobs. Ethiopia remains heavily dependent on agriculture, which accounts for 85% of employment. Per capita income is only about $1,000 - about $3 a day.</p> <p>Henok Beyene, an artist, said: \"Meles was an autocrat. Ethiopians have no experience of democracy, we have only ever experienced leadership from autocrats. Zenawi's genius was in how he controlled the minds of his people. He led everyone to believe there was no alternative to his leadership by creating a climate of fear and intimidation.\"</p> <p>Meles is survived by his wife, Azeb Mesfin, an MP, with whom he had three children. State TV said funeral arrangements would be announced soon.</p>"
