  "<p>Argentina's top TV journalist Jorge Lanata has alleged that he was held in the basement of Caracas airport for nearly two hours while Venezuela's secret service erased his team's camera, computer and cellphone memories. Only then, he says, were they allowed to leave the country.</p> <p>Lanata, a harsh critic of the Venezuelan government of Hugo Chavez and of the Argentinian president Cristina Kirchner, was returning to Buenos Aires on a regular airline flight after covering the Venezuelan election. One of the most popular segments of Lanata's show is a comedy segment with Chavez and Kirchner impersonators that has made his show, <a href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?v=MAWY-eLdGqw\" title=\"YouTube: Periodismo Para Todos\">Periodismo Para Todos</a> (Journalism for Everyone), one of the most popular on Argentine television.</p> <p>The journalist said that he and his team were interrogated by Venezuelan secret police and accused of spying because, during his report last night for the Argentinian TV channel 13, he showed two written orders from Venezuela's secret service ordering his surveillance while in Caracas.</p> <p>\"We are very shaken and they erased all the material we were bringing back,\" said Lanata on his release. The passengers of Lanata's airline flight had to wait for nearly two hours while the journalist and his team were interrogated.</p>",
  "<p>The highly-respected Pew Research organization has published a poll \u2013 and it's a shocker: Mitt Romney leads President Obama 49% to 45% among likely voters. This is one of Romney's few \u2013 and certainly largest \u2013 national leads in a non-Rasmussen poll this year.</p> <p>The headline result on its own would be attention-grabbing, but the detailed findings are even more impressive. The Pew poll, at least in its registered voters electorate (Romney and Obama are tied among this subset), has been the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/simon-jackman/skewed-polls-nonsense_b_1923107.html\">most pro-Democratic polling outfit</a> this entire cycle. Their <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2012-general-election-romney-vs-obama\">last poll before this</a> had Obama ahead by 8 points among likely voters. Let's break down the poll further and try to figure out what it means.</p> <p><strong>1). There has been a <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2012/10/08/romneys-strong-debate-performance-erases-obamas-lead/\">major change in party identification</a><br></strong><br>I'd argue that a lot of the volatility is from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/27/unskewing-polls-party-id-bunk\">major switch in party ID</a>. Pew's likely voter screen jumped from a 10-point Democratic edge in party ID to a 5-point Republican lead. Their registered voter results show an 11-point Democratic lead turning into a tie.</p> <p>Among analysts, I've been one of the most ardent in arguing that party ID should not be what tells us whether a poll is right or wrong. That said, I've also pointed out that when you <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ForecasterEnten/status/231503188505796610\">concentrate on one pollster</a>, party ID should remain relatively stable. It's the reason I critiqued a July Pew poll that I felt was \"too Democratic\". You just shouldn't have 10- to 15-point swings in two weeks. I feel the correct party ID weighting among likely voters should be somewhere between 11 points pro-Democratic and 5 points pro-Republican, while a registered voter number should be between 11 points Democratic and a tie.</p> <p><strong>2). Pew has had wild October swings before</strong></p> <p>Pew Research reported Obama leads over John McCain of 14 and 15 points in <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/national.html\">October 2008</a>. These leads were larger than Obama's final lead of 6 points and previous lead of 7 points. Those numbers were not, however, the result of wild party ID swings. It could mean that this year something has fundamentally shifted \u2013 or Pew just got really unlucky with their sample. Either way, it's a lesson that any poll result should be questioned and compared with other results.</p> <p><strong>3). Romney's got a winning racial coalition in this poll</strong></p> <p>All through this cycle, you couldn't escape articles saying that Mitt Romney <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/thenextamerica/politics/obama-needs-80-of-minority-vote-to-win-2012-presidential-election-20120824\">couldn't win without winning white voters</a> by a 20-point margin. He's got a 21-point lead among them in this poll. That's impossible for Obama to overcome even if this country is becoming more diverse. That 21-point lead would likely give Romney a 1- or 2-point lead if the electorate looked as it did 2008. But given what seems to be a growing Democratic enthusiasm problem, it lifts him to a 4-point advantage.</p> <p><strong>4). Romney has broken through in the midwest in this poll</strong></p> <p>Given Obama's strength with African Americans, college-educated whites, and Latinos, many \u2013 myself including myself \u2013 have long believed that Romney needed to win in the one region where there are fewer of these demographic groups: <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/05/18/romney_faces_a_blue_wall_--_but_is_it_solid.html\">the midwest</a>. Romney leads there by 6 points overall and by 21 points among whites. That <a href=\"http://elections.nytimes.com/2008/results/president/national-exit-polls.html\">result is better</a> than George W Bush managed in 2004 and is also better than George HW Bush in 1988, who won there by 5 points. If the poll is right, Romney is going to be doing pretty darn well in Iowa, Ohio, and Wisconsin.</p> <p><strong>5). Obama has a problem among men</strong></p> <p>Romney and Obama are tied among women in this survey, but Romney leads by 8 with men. It puts a whole new spin on the term \"<a href=\"http://swampland.time.com/2012/08/29/the-gender-gap-is-hurting-romney-beyond-his-control/\">gender gap</a>\".</p> <p><strong>Conclusion: we can't take too much from any one poll</strong></p> <p>There are reasons to believe the Pew poll is probably too pro-Romney. Still, with this normally Democratic-leaning poll, and the Daily Kos- and SEIU-sponsored <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Taniel/status/255367755317002241\">Public Policy Polling national poll</a> (coming out tomorrow) also having Romney in the lead, it's fairly safe to assume that this is not down to some conservative push to call this race tied.</p>",
  "<p>Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/08/mitt-romney-foreign-policy-speech-text\">given his most detailed foreign policy speech to date</a>. But how does Romney's vision for America's place in the world compare to the policies currently being pursued by the Obama administration \u2013 and there any contradictions?</p> <h2>Syria</h2> <p><strong>Romney:</strong> Called for the arming of anti-Assad rebels with weapons powerful enough to combat \"tanks, helicopters and fighter jets\". Romney has consistently criticised Obama for not giving enough support to the rebels.</p> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> Has encouraged Gulf states to arm the rebels, but only with small arms, out of concern that more powerful weapons could fall into hostile hands after the revolution, as happened with the flow of guns out of Libya to other parts of north Africa, including Islamist rebels in Mali. The US has also offered training, intelligence information and military advice to the Syrian rebels.</p> <p><strong>Contradictions:</strong> While Romney criticises Obama for not doing enough to confront those he regards as Islamist extremists in other parts of the Middle East, including the newly elected government of Egypt, he would arm groups in Syria about which he knows little.</p> <h2>Libya</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397400444\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/13/1347532375488/A-US-flag-lies-amid-the-r-004.jpg\" alt=\"A US flag lies amid the rubble at the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya,where Chris Stevens was killed\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A US flag lies amid the rubble at the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya, where US diplomat Chris Stevens and three others were killed on 11 September Photograph: Stringer/EPA</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stringer/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Romney:</strong> Blamed Obama for failures around the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi that killed four Americans, including Chris Stevens, the US ambassador. Romney has accused Obama of failing to recognise that the attack is evidence that al-Qaida is still a force to be reckoned with and should be confronted in Libya. He also blamed the president for poor security at the consulate and for not confronting the Islamist militias responsible for the attack. Romney portrays this as a reflection of Obama's weakness.</p> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> Sought to strengthen the hand of the shaky new civilian regime in Libya, offering intelligence assistance including the use of drones to track extremist camps. The US has worked with the new government to try to draw the militias into the military and under central control, or to disarm them. But has steered clear of any suggestion of direct military intervention.</p> <p><strong>Unanswered questions &amp; contradictions:</strong> Romney has not said how he proposes to combat extremists in Libya. Ground troops or drone attacks are likely to create a severe backlash in a country where, while Nato's bombing raids were welcome and crucial in support of last year's revolution, there was strong opposition to foreign forces on the ground.</p> <p>In fact, Libya is a relative success story despite the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, illustrated by the large numbers of people in Benghazi who turned out to challenge the militiamen, driving them from their base, and to protest in support of the US.</p> <p>Romney seems to see no contradiction between his call to arm Syrian rebels while condemning Obama for not taking on armed groups in Libya.</p> <p>Romney is also open to charges of flip-flopping on Libya after initially opposing US air attacks in support of the rebels last year and then backing it.</p> <h2>Afghanistan</h2> <p><strong>Romney:</strong> Opposes the 2014 deadline for the withdrawal of the last US combat troops. He has accused Obama of effectively telling the Taliban it only has to keep fighting for another two years and then the Americans will be gone.</p> <p>Romney proposes sticking with Obama's transition of the main combat role to Afghan security forces by the end of 2014 but keeping a significant US military contingent in the country as back-up. He said that pulling out of Afghanistan too early will only lead to more war, and potentially more terrorist attacks on the US, because it will abandon Afghanistan to the extremists responsible for 9/11.</p> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> Set the deadline for withdrawal from America's longest war in the face of a now unpopular and, to many people, unwinnable conflict. It is also costly.</p> <p><strong>Unanswered questions:</strong> While Romney has committed to keep the US military in Afghanistan, he has not said how he intends to achieve what American forces have been unable to do in a decade of fighting \u2013 defeat the Taliban. One way out is to negotiate, although a Romney administration will find that hard to do given the language he has used to describe the Taliban.</p> <h2>Iran</h2> <p><strong>Romney:</strong> Previously criticised Obama for not taking a stronger stand in confronting Iran over its nuclear programme. The implication was that he believed the US should be willing to resort to military action sooner rather than later. But Romney has shifted ground toward Obama's position that increasingly tough sanctions are, for now, the way to press Tehran. Romney, notably, did not embrace the Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu's call for a \"red line\" that, if Iran's nuclear programme crossed, would automatically trigger an attack.</p> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> Puts the emphasis on diplomacy and sanctions, saying that Tehran is far enough away from developing a nuclear weapon that there is no urgent need for military action. But the president has repeatedly said he will not permit Iran to develop an atomic bomb and that he is prepared to use force to prevent it if necessary.</p> <p><strong>Unanswered questions:</strong> Romney, like Obama, has not specified at what point he would consider military action against Tehran. He also made no mention of diplomacy while supporting Obama's sanctions policy. But it's difficult to see how Romney could separate sanctions for the diplomatic track.</p> <h2>Israel-Palestine</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397400445\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/7/30/1343659358640/Mitt-Romney-in-front-of-J-004.jpg\" alt=\"Mitt Romney in front of Jerusalem's Old City\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">U.S. Republican Presidential candidate Mitt Romney is pictured in front of the Old City of Jerusalem as he delivers foreign policy remarks at Mishkenot Sha'ananim, July 29, 2012.   REUTERS/Jason Reed  (JERUSALEM - Tags: POLITICS) :rel:d:bm:GF2E87T1CO301 Photograph: Jason Reed/REUTERS</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Reed/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Romney:</strong> Was secretly recorded at a fundraising describing the Palestinians as not interested in peace and as committed to the destruction of Israel. On a visit to Israel in July, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/01/romney-israel-comments-lags-polls\">Romney portrayed Jewish culture as superior</a>, saying that it explained why Israelis were prosperous and Palestinians lived in relative poverty. The Republican candidate has also accused Obama of abandoning Israel and jeopardising its security over Iran. He has firmly allied himself with the Israeli government on almost every issue, including saying he would not press it to negotiate with the Palestinians.</p> <p>Romney attempted to row back in his foreign policy speech, saying that he will \"recommit America to the goal of a democratic, prosperous Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with the Jewish state of Israel\". He accused Obama of failing in that goal.</p> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> Early in his presidency he attempted to press Netanyahu to take peace talks seriously by freezing expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Netanyahu pushed back, and the pair's relationship has soured, made worse by differences over Iran. But Obama significantly increased military assistance to Israel and won praise from Netanyahu and Israeli military chiefs for it.</p> <p><strong>Contradictions and unanswered questions:</strong> Romney appears to have confused the Palestinian leadership in the West Bank with Hamas in Gaza, exposing a woeful ignorance of the issues which will make a difficult situation worse if he inherits the White House. He has effectively surrendered even the pretence at an American-led peace process and Washington as a neutral arbiter. That will only strengthen the view in much of the Arab world that US policy is driven primarily by serving Israel's interests.</p> <h2>Russia</h2> <p><strong>Romney:</strong> Has revived cold war era rhetoric by calling Vladimir Putin's Russia America's \"No 1 geopolitical foe\". He has portrayed Russia as a menace to the new democracies of eastern Europe. Romney has criticised Obama for missile reduction treaties and calling off plans for missile bases in Poland and the Czech Republic. Accuses Obama of showing weakness.</p> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> Attempted a \"reset\" with Russia but it quickly ran into the mire. He has since accused Moscow of \"evil behaviour\". However, Obama concluded that there were more pressing foreign policy problems and that it was important to maintain a working relationship on issues such as Iran and Syria.</p> <p><strong>Contraditions &amp; unanswered questions:</strong> Romney has attempted to defend his much-derided \"foe\" remarks by pointing to its power at the United Nations, including its blocking of stronger measures against Syria and its reluctance to impose sanctions on Iran. But he said that it does not make Russia an enemy and that it is not the primary national security threat to the US. Romney has not said how he will face down Moscow.</p> <h2>China</h2> <p><strong>Romney:</strong> On the one hand, he derides Obama for \"pivoting\" policy toward Asia when unrest in the Middle East and Putin's Russia are more immediate threats. On the other, Romney has warned about China's growing assertiveness \"sending chills through the region\". Romney is keen to take on China over what he says is unfair trading through the manipulation of the value of its currency.</p> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> The President's pivot toward Asia is as much about reassuring US allies \u2013 some of them newfound, such as Vietnam \u2013 worried about rising Chinese influence. What is billed as the biggest US military build-up in the region since the Vietnam war is more politically than militarily significant, as Obama treads a path of continuing to assert American influence in the region without getting into a confrontation with Beijing.</p> <p><strong>Unanswered questions:</strong> Besides threatening a trade war with China, Romney has not said how he intends to handle China's rising influence and power. But Beijing may conclude from Romney's criticism of Obama that it is not a priority for the Republican candidate.</p>",
  "<p>The veteran PBS anchor Jim Lehrer has defended his performance in last week's presidential debate, insisting he was \"not there to question people\".</p> <p>Lehrer has faced some criticism for failing to challenge questionable assertions by the candidates, for not pressing Mitt Romney on his 47% comments, and for allowing both to run over their allotted time.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/shows/bl/2012/oct/08/debate-host/\">Appearing on The Brian Lehrer Show on WNYC,</a> New York's public radio station, Lehrer \u2013 no relation to his host \u2013 said he was \"not apologetic\" and said the debate had been the first \"unrehearsed\" moment of the presidential campaign.</p> <p>After a caller criticised him for not grilling Romney over the covert video which showed him criticising 47% of the population, Lehrer said: \"The reason that I didn't ask is because I felt that those were the questions that the two candidates were to ask,\" Lehrer said.</p> <p>\"I was not there to question people. I was there to allow the candidates to question each other. \u2026 Certainly I could have brought up the 47% \u2013 there were all kinds of things I could have brought up. </p> <p>\"But I wanted to put it out there in front of the two candidates and let them \u2026 if 47% was to be brought up in a way that was unattractive to Romney then it was Obama's responsibility to do that.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.wnyc.org/widgets/ondemand_player/#file=%2Faudio%2Fxspf%2F242101%2F;containerClass=wnyc\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"54\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.wnyc.org/widgets/ondemand_player/#file=%2Faudio%2Fxspf%2F242101%2F;containerClass=wnyc\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Lehrer said he felt \"very comfortable\" about his performance, reiterating that he was there to \"facilitate\" debate rather than challenge the candidates.</p> <p>\"If they didn't want to do it then I wasn't going to do it for them. And that's my answer, and I have no apology. I'm not apologetic about it. I'm actually very positive about it.\"</p> <p>Lehrer, the executive editor of PBS's Newshour, was hosting his 12th debate on Wednesday night. Criticism began <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/04/jim-lehrer-debate-sucked\">as soon as the debate ended</a>. Chris Matthews, the pugilistic MSNBC host, said: \"Today, moderators are expected to be aggressive: they're going to ask a question, they throw it out there, they don't just say a topic. They ask a question.\" Former New York Times editor Bill Keller said Lehrer was \"roadkill\".</p> <p>Asked about Romney's repeated interruptions of Lehrer, he said people would be able to make up their own minds about the candidates' conduct.</p> <p>\"Everybody saw it. So if someone was to be turned off by the way Mitt Romney interrupted me, then they saw it. My point is that there was 67 million people who watched that, and there's no spin on this afterward. You can't spin what everybody saw,\" Lehrer said.</p> <p>Lehrer was also criticised for failing to keep the candidates to their pre-arranged time limits, with the delays so severe that the final segment of the debate was restricted to three minutes instead of the planned 15. The 78-year-old was unrepentant, however, insisting the debate had broken new ground and was the first \"unrehearsed, uncanned event of this campaign\".</p> <p>\"This was the first time in the history of American political campaigning where an incumbent president of the United States stood eyeball to eyeball to a challenger and they talked at each other, and they talked about things that matter, that each was allowed to challenge the other and respond to that challenge,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>The single best description that one can make about Mitt Romney's foreign policy agenda to date is that, quite simply, it's a critique, not a policy.</p> <p>Rather than lay out a vision for American power, or even an alternative to the national security stewardship of Barack Obama, Romney has been content to simply say why he thinks the president has done a lousy job, without offering voters any sense of what he would do differently as commander-in-chief. And <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/08/mitt-romney-foreign-policy-speech-text\">his speech at Virginia Military Institute Monday</a> was pretty much more of the same.</p> <p>Indeed, one would be hard-pressed to find a single substantive difference between what Romney is proposing as a candidate and Obama is actually doing as president. Consider, for example, Romney's discussion of Iran \u2013 an area in which he has claimed there are significant contrasts between his views and those of the president:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I will put the leaders of Iran on notice that the United States and our friends and allies will prevent them from acquiring nuclear weapons capability. I will not hesitate to impose new sanctions on Iran, and will tighten the sanctions we currently have. I will restore the permanent presence of aircraft carrier task forces in both the eastern Mediterranean and the Gulf the region \u2013 and work with Israel to increase our military assistance and coordination. For the sake of peace, we must make clear to Iran through actions \u2013 not just words \u2013&#xa0;that their nuclear pursuit will not be tolerated.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>I dare you to try and identify any difference between this policy and the policy currently being implemented by President Obama. Aside from perhaps a slightly more punitive approach to sanctions, and a more direct reference to the use of force in the last sentence, the two candidate's approaches are almost completely identical. Monday's entire speech from Romney was like this. </p> <p>\u2022 On Libya, Romney says he will \"support the Libyan people's efforts to forge a lasting government that represents all of them\" \u2013 this is President Obama's strategy.</p> <p>\u2022 On Egypt, Romney says, \"I will use our influence \u2013 including clear conditions on our aid \u2013 to urge the new government to represent all Egyptians, to build democratic institutions, and to maintain its peace treaty with Israel\". This is President Obama's current strategy in Egypt.</p> <p>\u2022 On Afghanistan, Romney says, \"I will evaluate conditions on the ground and weigh the best advice of our military commanders. And I will affirm that my duty is not to my political prospects, but to the security of the nation\". Again, this is the same approach taken by President Obama.</p> <p>The only single area where one could possibly find even a hint of variance between the two men is on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/08/romney-obama-failed-leadership-middle-east\">sending arms to the opposition forces in Syria</a> who, as Romney put it, \"share our values\". Good luck in determining that; but again, this, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/21/world/middleeast/cia-said-to-aid-in-steering-arms-to-syrian-rebels.html?hp\">according to the New York Times</a>, is to some extent already happening.</p> <p>Romney's entire speech relies on projecting a version of Obama's foreign policy that is simply belied by reality. For example, Romney continues to claim that \"the president has not signed one new free trade agreement in the past four years\", even though he has signed three \u2013 with South Korea, Panama and Colombia.</p> <p>Where Romney criticizes Obama, his objections are contradicted by his own platitudes. On the one hand, he talks about the struggle between \"democracy and despotism\" in the Middle East; at the same time, he attacks the Obama administration for not keeping troops in Iraq longer \u2013 even though the departure of US troops was the explicit desire of a freely-elected, democratic Iraqi government. Apparently, Romney's support of democracy is correlated, somewhat, with his own policy preferences.</p> <p>He says that he will call on America's Nato allies to pony up more for defense spending and hitting their Nato benchmarks \u2013 a perennial call from US policy-makers that has always fallen on deaf ears in Europe. The idea that Romney, who has directly insulted the UK, Spain, France and other European nations for their social welfare policies, will extract bigger shares of Nato's defense budget from them seems far-fetched at best.</p> <p>But Romney's foreign policy delusion is not limited to Europe. While he has repeatedly insulted the Palestinian people and said they have no real interest in peace with Israel, he says that a new president \u2013 a Romney presidency \u2013 \"will bring the chance to begin anew\" in resolving the conflict. And this from a man who says Barack Obama believes \"hope\" is a strategy!</p> <p>Perhaps the most delusional element of Romney's speech, though was this:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"It is the responsibility of our president to use America's great power to shape history \u2013 not to lead from behind, leaving our destiny at the mercy of events.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>To be sure, these are words that have a long history on the presidential campaign trail: paeans to American exceptionalism and influence on the world stage are nothing new. In 2008, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/16/uselections2008.barackobama\">Barack Obama spoke of his desire</a> \"to lead the world anew\". These sentiments are indicative of a larger and more troubling conceit in American foreign policy: the notion that we Americans possess the power to shape global events.</p> <p>During the cold war, arguably, the United States possessed some semblance of political suasion: the potential for planet-destroying nuclear war and the presence of a rival superpower had a way of grabbing the attention of like-minded nations. But in the post-cold war era, while the US remains a powerful global actor, we are miles away from omnipotence. To an extent greater than our politicians would like to admit, the United States is often \"at the mercy of events\"; and our ability to bend other nations and peoples to our will is surely limited.</p> <p>Even in places where the US has directly intervened, like Iraq and Afghanistan, our influence over nominal allies has been remarkably constrained. In places where we provide significant financial assistance: Pakistan, Israel and, again, Afghanistan, each of these nation's leaders do largely as they please, not as the United States demands. Minor considerations like reality did not, however, prevent Romney implicitly criticizing Obama's policy in the Middle East \u2013 and arguing that a better course exists:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We cannot support our friends and defeat our enemies in the Middle East when our words are not backed up by deeds, when our defense spending is being arbitrarily and deeply cut, when we have no trade agenda to speak of, and the perception of our strategy is not one of partnership, but of passivity.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>But no serious observer of the region believes that any of these policies would have any significant impact on the process of political transformation taking place in the Middle East. And Romney is silent about why, even in places where our engagement is the greatest, our influence appears to have such a minimal impact.</p> <p>In Mitt Romney's worldview \u2013 in so much as one can detect one \u2013 the key to American power lies in some amorphous notion of US leadership disconnected from the extraordinary challenges of actually conducting foreign policy. Talking about leadership and resolve is easy \u2013 doing it is the hard part.</p> <p>This explains, more than any other reason, why Romney's policy prescriptions are so vague and meaningless. It's the yawning chasm between what American power can actually achieve and what a politician seeking to be president says it ought to be doing.</p> <p>In the end, Romney doesn't have much of a coherent policy agenda and his critique is wildly off-base. His real problem, though, is that he barely seems to grasp how the world \u2013 and, in turn, American power \u2013 actually works.</p>",
  "<p>A world where Mitt Romney holds the single most powerful office may sound a very different place from that of Barack Obama. In many ways, however, it is likely to look uncannily familiar.</p> <p>On one global issue after another, the Republican candidate has lambasted his opponent for his alleged failure to stand up for US interests and values abroad \u2013 a traditional theme of Republican attacks on Democrats. But to the extent Romney has put forward concrete proposals, most have been all but indistinguishable from the status quo, according to both liberal and conservative analysts as well as diplomats in Washington.</p> <p>The main caveat concerns a future president Romney's response to a crisis, where instincts may prove more important than long-held plans. George Bush came to office in January 2001 with a conventional list of foreign policy priorities, led by a carefully rehearsed response to the rise of China, only to veer off sharply after the 9/11 attacks.</p> <p>The most immediate global crisis now which is likely to be on the top of the Oval Office in-tray for whoever wins next month's election, is the Syrian conflict. Arguably the most striking sentence in the <a href=\"http:////www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/08/mitt-romney-arm-syrian-rebels\" title=\"\">Republican candidate's speech</a> to the Virginia Military Institute on Monday relates to Syria. The current administration has allowed weapons supplies to flow to the Free Syrian Army (FSA) and other rebel groups from the Syrian diaspora, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, rather than provide them directly. Romney does not commit the US to supply arms, but talks about working with \"our international partners\" to deliver them. Whereas the Obama administration appears to have made great efforts to limit the flow largely to guns and ammunition, Romney said the rebels should be equipped with \"the arms they need to defeat Assad's tanks, helicopters, and fighter jets\".</p> <p>The FSA has already been able to get hold of anti-tank weapons, both improvised and hi-tech, with the result that Syrian government forces now use tanks much more cautiously; they rely on helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft for bombarding pro-opposition city districts. Providing shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missiles in significant numbers could decisively tilt the strategic balance and accelerate the fall of the regime. Romney argues that such actions now would strengthen US leverage in a post-Assad Syria, mitigating the resentment towards Washington expressed by most opposition groups.</p> <p>However, such a policy would also have a wide array of other consequences, both intended and otherwise. Romney presents the move as directed as much at Iran as Assad.</p> <p>\"Iran is sending arms to Assad because they know his downfall would be a strategic defeat for them,\" he said. \"We should be working no less vigorously with our international partners to support the many Syrians who would deliver that defeat to Iran, rather than sitting on the sidelines.\"</p> <p>Such a confrontation would have the same repercussions that persuaded Obama to stay at arm's length. Michael O'Hanlon, a national security expert at the <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/\" title=\"\">Brookings Institution</a> and an adviser to the CIA chief, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2012/jan/04/general-petraeus-whisky-cover-operators\" title=\"\">General David Petraeus</a>, said Iran could retaliate against US troops in Afghanistan. Furthermore, a substantial increase in the quantity and quality of the arms sent to the Syrian rebels would present a significant challenge to Moscow, previously described by Romney as America's \"no 1 enemy\". Russia might respond by upping its own support to Assad, raising the prospect of a proxy war.\"Syria may be the space where Romney may want to show he is prepared to confront Russia,\" O'Hanlon said. \"At the moment, the US is providing logistics. Obama feels that providing arms would cross a threshold with Russia ... Romney might not hold back in the same way.\"</p> <p>An escalation would have such far-reaching consequences, some Washington diplomats argued, that a Romney administration could well rethink the policy. They pointed out that his political career has hitherto been characterised principally by caution, and suggested that a true test of his intentions would be who, among the squabbling camps within his 30-strong coterie of foreign policy advisers, gets the big jobs if he wins.</p> <p>Currently, the advisers closest to the candidate are leaning towards the neo-conservative right, including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/14/mitt-romney-foreign-policy-advisers\" title=\"\">Richard Williamson</a>, a veteran of the Ronald Reagan and George W Bush administrations, <a href=\"http://www.rightweb.irc-online.org/profile/senor_dan\" title=\"\">Dan Senor</a>, who served as a spokesman for the US-led occupation government in Baghdad after the 2003 invasion. Liz Cheney, daughter of the former vice-president Dick Cheney, is believed to have written some of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/08/us/politics/romney-remains-vague-on-foreign-policy-details.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=0&amp;hp\" title=\"\">Romney's commentaries and speeches</a> and, according to the New York Times, has begun to join a weekly conference call on foreign affairs issues with the candidate.</p> <p>However, the strategist on the Romney national security transition team is <a href=\"http://rightweb.irc-online.org/profile/Zoellick_Robert\" title=\"\">Robert Zoellick</a>, a former World Bank president and exponent of the moderate \"realist\" school of Republican foreign policy. In the European embassies in Washington, most bets are on him to become secretary of stateif Romney wins. The narrow favourite for defence secretary is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/condoleezza-rice\" title=\"\">Condoleezza Rice</a>, who helped shape the more cautious foreign policy of Bush's second term, and was given high billing at this year's Republican convention.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.rightweb.irc-online.org/profile/kagan_robert\" title=\"\">Robert Kagan</a>, a neoconservative historian and adviser to the candidate, agreed that a Romney White House would be unlikely to make radical foreign policy departures.</p> <p>\"There is a tremendous amount of continuity between presidents,\" Kagan said at a debate about America's place in the world last week organised by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"Any new president only changes things 10 degrees one way or 10 degrees another.\"</p> <p>Some Washington observers did not even detect 10 degrees of divergence. Spencer Ackerman, a writer on national security for Wired magazine, even suggested that with today's speech, Romney was in effect running \"for Obama's second term\".</p> <p>\"So Romney's foreign policy would be Obama's foreign policy, just with meaner things to say about Obama?,\" Ackerman tweeted.</p> <p>On a range of the major foreign affairs issues outlined by Romney, the harsh words directed at Obama are not matched by a significant difference in policy. So, on the Arab spring, Romney promised to support the democratic movements across North Africa, including in Libya, where he had been a vocal sceptic over western intervention.</p> <p>Similarly, despite his close links with Binyamin Netanyahu and his cynicism over the chance of a Middle East peace settlement inadvertently revealed <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/romney-secret-video-israeli-palestinian-middle-east-peace\" title=\"\">in a leaked video last month</a>, Romney official policy on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the long-term Washington orthodoxy of support for the creation of a Palestinian state alongside its Jewish neighbour. A Romney administration might be less active than a second Obama term in pursuing such a two-state solution, but Robert Malley, a Middle East expert at the <a href=\"http://www.crisisgroup.org/\" title=\"\">International Crisis Group</a>, believes that Obama too \"sees there is, right now, no opportunity for a breakthrough.\"</p> <p>On Afghanistan too, Romney portrays himself as a fierce critic of Obama policy, but his formula for extricating the US \u2013 \"a real and successful transition to Afghan security forces by the end of 2014\" \u2013 is identical to Obama's plan.</p> <p>The most important foreign policy and national security decision the next president is likely to have to take is whether to launch an attack on Iran with the aim of destroying or at least hindering its nuclear programme, either alone or in concert with Israel and other allies. That choice, O'Hanlon says, \"will be the centrepiece of the next presidency, whoever wins\".</p> <p>\"Obama may already feel he has been mired in two wars and a recession. He wants to do other things, and he recognises the interconnectedness of a decision about war to the entire presidency. Romney probably leans slightly more hawkish,\" O'Hanlon said.</p> <p>In contrast to his pledge to take Iran on directly in Syria, Romney's use of language about the Iranian nuclear crisis is more cautious, and again represents a duplicate of Obama administration policy. Like Obama, he suggests his red line would be to prevent Iran \"from acquiring nuclear weapons capability\", and would use sanctions as his primary tool to that end.</p> <p>Malley said that: \"The people around Romney say he is as unlikely as Obama to launch a strike against Iran.\"</p> <p>However, some long-term observers of US engagement with Iran voiced concern that Romney's inexperience in foreign policy and his tendency to \"shoot from the hip\" rhetorically could upset the precarious but enduring common front with Russia and China on Iran, that the Bush and Obama administrations both made the focus of their policy.</p> <p>\"The Romney approach will not be fundamentally different from Obama's, with one huge exception. Romney and some of his people will say things internationally that will split the coalition Obama has been so careful to build up,\" said <a href=\"http://www.carnegieendowment.org/experts/?fa=expert_view&amp;expert_id=145\" title=\"\">George Perkovich</a>, an expert on non-proliferation at the Carnegie Endowment for International Affairs.\"No one wants to go to war. The military has made it clear that nothing can be achieved by it, and Romney would get confronted by the military on the issue on his first day in office.\"</p> <p>The true significance of a shift from an Obama to a Romney foreign policy may only be revealed if Israel presses it into the open by forcing the next president's hand. Romney may respond very differently to an unilateral Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear sites than Obama, whose cool relationship with the Israeli leader could well colour Middle East policy if he wins a second term.</p> <p>Democratic foreign policy advisers suggest that an Obama White House would quickly warn Iran not to try to widen the conflict by attacking US interests or its Gulf allies. But a limited Iranian response to an Israeli strike, especially one where Washington isn't warned, might well be tolerated. That might not be true of Romney, who diplomats and analysts predict might be slightly more ready to go to war at Israel's side if forced into a corner. But it is hard to predict the instincts of a man who has so far appeared to give foreign policy relatively little attention. Romney's world, like Obama's, is more likely to be shaped by events than by doctrine.</p>",
  "<p>The Venezuelan president, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, brandished the sword of independence hero Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar as he celebrated his re-election with a promise to further his government's brand of socialism during a new six-year term, in which he will face several economic challenges.</p> <p>\"Truthfully, this has been the perfect battle, a democratic battle,\" Ch\u00e1vez told the euphoric crowd outside the Miraflores palace. \"Venezuela will continue along the path of democratic and Bolivarian socialism of the 21st century.\"</p> <p>The triumph was shared by jubilant supporters throughout Sunday night after a hard-fought but convincing victory over the opposition challenger, Henrique Capriles.</p> <p>Tens of thousands of supporters descended on Caracas in cars, on motorbikes and minibuses, waving flags, honking horns and chanting: \"Viva la patria!\" (long live the fatherland).</p> <p>In the barrios of Catia and 23 de Enero \u2013 the heartlands of Chavismo \u2013 a party mood seized the streets as red-shirted residents danced and sang while fireworks exploded overhead. Some cried mock tears as they carried the \"political coffin\" of challenger Capriles.</p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez won 54.4% of the vote, 9.5 points ahead of his rival. The margin of victory gives Ch\u00e1vez a strong democratic mandate until 2018.</p> <p>Attention now focuses on whether he can use this popular endorsement to build on the gains of the past 13 years \u2013 notably a sharp reduction in poverty, unemployment and infant mortaility \u2013 while doing more to address rising concerns about violent crime, overdependence on oil and deteriorating infrastructure.</p> <p>He also faces an opposition that has united for the first time this year and gained votes despite what it said was an unfair playing field in terms of access to state resources and air time.</p> <p>Thanks to the record high turnout, Ch\u00e1vez also won more votes this time than in 2006, though the margin of victory was tighter than in any of his previous races. Supporters said this vindicated their claims that the opposition had concocted fake polls as well as rumours about the imminent demise of Ch\u00e1vez to cancer.</p> <p>\"Spin doctors have constructed a macabre operation that violates his privacy and human decency by telling all sorts of lies. They said his death was imminent and that he would arrive at the election in a wheelchair. But look at him,\" said a close aide. \"He's in complete condition to carry out the presidency.\"</p> <p>But the health concerns are unlikely to disappear. \"I think it's inevitable that a victory margin of less than 15% will lead to intense discussions within the Ch\u00e1vez camp,\" said Nicmer Evans, a political science professor at the Central University of Venezuela. \"The subject of illness has been neutralised until now, but it'll be reopened after the vote.\"</p> <p>Evans, who accurately predicted the outcome of the election, also expected a cabinet reshuffle. \"Ch\u00e1vez has been failed by the people around him. He needs to change his team. We'll see that after the election,\" he said. Senior officials said the government would boost measures to address violent crime and economic vulnerabilities among the worst affected.</p> <p>Among those who shifted allegiance from Ch\u00e1vez, a commonly heard cause was the growing fear of crime. In 2009, Ch\u00e1vez created a whole new security body \u2013 the National Bolivarian police force \u2013 but Venezuela still has one of the four highest murder rates in the world, with a murder every half an hour. The rate has almost doubled since Ch\u00e1vez took power to 45.1 per 100,000 of the population, in 2011.</p> <p>Tough economic challenges also lie ahead. Despite its oil wealth, Venezuela has borrowed heavily in recent years and is now running a fiscal deficit. The IMF estimates the deficit at 7.4% of GDP, although private sector analysts say the figure could be close to 20%. Ahead of the election, Ch\u00e1vez ramped up public spending, increasing pensions, building homes and raising the minimum wage. To meet debt obligations and pay for these measures, he will come under pressure to devalue the Bolivar \u2013 which now trades on the black market at more than double the official rate against the dollar \u2013 or significantly raise oil revenues, which account for 95% of Venezuela's export earnings.</p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez has outlined plans to more than triple production by 2020 from the heavy crude fields in the Orinoco Belt \u2013 which BP and Opec have identified as the world's biggest reserves of oil. That would push Venezuela past Iran in terms of output, but will require huge investment, technology transfer and a bigger skilled workforce. Some will come from existing partners \u2013 including China's CNPC, Chevron of the US and firms from Russia, Vietnam and India. Others, like BP and Shell, have so far been on the sidelines when it comes to developing new blocks. Managers at the state-owned PDVSA oil company said several multinationals were waiting until the outcome of the election to decide whether to participate in the expansion.</p> <p>If they hoped for change, it is unlikely to come. Miguel Tinker Salas, professor of Latin American Studies at Pomona College in California, said Ch\u00e1vez's victory implied continuity with an existing oil policy of state-led development, bolstering sales to China and using oil to shape foreign policy.</p> <p>Access to Venezuela's oil \u2013 as well as ideology and personality \u2013 help to explain how Ch\u00e1vez is seen overseas. In response to the election result, the US, which has seen its share of Venezuelan oil drop in the past decade, omitted direct recognition of the president's success. \"We congratulate the Venezuelan people for the high turnout and generally peaceful manner in which this election was carried out,\" said state department spokesman William Ostick. But President Ra\u00fal Castro of Cuba, which receives subsidised oil from its Caribbean neighbour, was among the many Latin American leaders who sent warm congratulations to Ch\u00e1vez on his victory. \"Ch\u00e1vez wins, the people win\", said the headline on the Diario Granma website of the Communist party of Cuba.</p> <p>But it would be wrong to characterise the politics of Venezuela as a simple re-run of the cold war. Ch\u00e1vez has a popular mandate and a very different set of challenges. Whether he will respond to his smaller margin of victory by moving closer to the centre or to more radical policies remains to be seen.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 17 December 2012 to clarify that although some private sector analysts put Venezuela's fiscal deficit at close to 20% of GDP, the IMF estimate is 7.4%.</p>",

His proposals, they said, were a mixture of neo-conservative ideas from the Bush era and policies that Obama was already pursuing.</p> <p>In his toughest language yet against Obama's foreign policy record, Romney said: \"When we look at the Middle East today \u2014 Iran closer than ever to nuclear weapons capability, with the conflict in Syria threatening to destabilise the region, with violent extremists on the march and with an American ambassador and three others dead likely at the hands of al-Qaida \u2014 it is clear that the risk of conflict in the region is higher now than when the president took office.\"</p> <p>Apart from a shift towards backing the supply of heavier weaponry to Syrian rebels \u2013 by Saudi Arabia and Qatar \u2013 Romney had little new to say and leaves unanswered many key foreign policy questions.</p> <p>He reiterated his intent to confront Russia \u2013 even though many American foreign policy analysts see al-Qaida rather than Russia as the main threat to the US \u2013 and Iran.</p> <p>Although the language on Iran is tough, Romney proposed a mixture of threats and sanctions that were not dissimilar to the Obama administration's current approach.</p> <p>In his speech, Romney made the case for a more interventionist US foreign policy. \"Our friends and allies across the globe do not want less American leadership \u2026 This is what makes America exceptional. It is not just the character of our country; it is the record of our accomplishments. America has a proud history of strong, confident, principled global leadership \u2013 a history that has been written by patriots of both parties.\"</p> <p>He accused Obama of \"missing an historic opportunity to win new friends who share our values in the Middle East, friends who are fighting for their own futures against the very same violent extremists, and evil tyrants, and angry mobs who seek to harm us.\"</p> <p>He quoted a Syrian woman as saying: \"We will not forget that you forgot about us.\"</p> <p>The speech was heavily trailed in advance, including an excerpt in which Romney promised more help for the rebels, who are out-gunned by the the forces of President Bashar al-Assad, which are using tanks, jets and helicopters.</p> <p>\"Iran is sending arms to Assad because they know his downfall would be a strategic defeat for them. We should be working no less vigorously with our international partners to support the many Syrians who would deliver that defeat to Iran \u2013 rather than sitting on the sidelines,\" he said.</p> <p>Romney's comments received a positive response from Syrian rebel leaders. Mustafa Sheikh, joint head of the Free Syrian Army military council, said: \"We welcome, and we need, any American support, whether that be weapons, money, or anything we can use. The Americans need not be afraid that their support will go to the wrong people, or be wasted. It will be appreciated and it will be valuable. We appreciate that this is now being discussed.\"</p> <p>Romney also criticised Obama over his handling of the killing of the US ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans, noting the contrast between the administration initially blaming riots over an anti-Muslim movie made in the US and a recent statement pointing to al-Qaida elements.</p> <p>One of the most awkward parts of the speech was Romney's reaffirmation of the traditional US role as a supposed arbiter in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This contrasted with his speech in May, caught on a secret video, in which he said the Palestinians were not interested in peace, the chances of a peace agreement was remote and the whole issue should be kicked down the field.</p> <p>On Afghanistan, over which Romney has faced a lot of criticism for failing to mention it during his Republican convention speech, he said he would not be tied to the deadline set by Obama for withdrawal by the end of 2014 and hinted he might delay it.</p> <p>\"The route to more war \u2013 and to potential attacks here at home \u2013 is a politically timed retreat that abandons the Afghan people to the same extremists who ravaged their country and used it to launch the attacks of 9/11,\" he said.</p> <p>The former secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, who has been called in to help the Obama team, told reporters that there was a lot of rhetoric but not a lot of specifics. She said Romney did not seem to understand America's role in the 21st century and his identification of Russia as the number one enemy reflected a nostalgia for cold war thinking.</p> <p>\"I would like to ask Govenor Romney and his advisers how he would do things differently,\" she said.</p> <p>The Obama campaign issued an ad saying Romney had already failed the commander-in-chief test, citing his accident-prone tour of the UK, Israel and Poland in the summer and various comments since then. </p> <p>The ad says: \"If this is how he handles the world now, just think of what Romney might do as president.</p> <p>It also said he was telling outright lies, as when he said Obama had signed no trade deals. Obama's team said he had signed three.</p>",
  "<div id=\"block-50731af958f91d7bbadac0e7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T18:27:05.937Z\">7.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>That's it, I'm afraid. Here are a few thoughts:</p> <p>\u2022 More people will turn up to David Cameron's speech on Wednesday - partly because it will be held in a much bigger hall. But the reception and atmosphere tonight was less like a political speech and more like some form of live entertainment: Boris was cheered and applauded to the rafters, and the scenes when he arrived in the middle of the crowd and made his way to the stage, with heads turning and people leaping up from their seats, bordered on megalomania. All this for a politician. Cameron's reception will be nothing like that. I think Boris showed tonight beyond doubt that in terms of his public image he is one of a kind, and is gathering strength. His conference speech last year was well-attended and well-received, but the fuss and buzz was nothing like this. Unbelievably, he is scheduled to speak again in the main hall tomorrow morning. The conference organisers could not have planned this better to build momentum for the mayor at the expense of Cameron.</p> <p>\u2022&#xa0;Boris was conspicuously loyal, praising Cameron and the coalition and attacking Labour and Eds Miliband and Balls. But wasn't it strange to say that \"while I am mayor\" Labour could get back into power - something surely designed to conjure up the image of himself as the leading anti-Labour force? And his firm opposition to a third runway at Heathrow seemed to be aimed squarely at the coalition: \"Move off that idea. It's not going to happen. We need a better solution.\" The supposed point of this rally, his passing on of advice on how to beat Labour, was skipped over speedily - perhaps because his own experience in London is almost completely irrelevant to the national Tory party's attempt to win in 2015.</p> <p>\u2022 He used all his usual rhetorical tricks: he was funny, irreverent, self-deprecating, multilingual, anti-French, policy-light, and a political clothes-stealer, even at one point making a slight dig at Margaret Thatcher, when he said: \"The 103 bodies that can dig up the roads - basically under Thatcherite legislation put down when very few private utilities existed \u2026 We have finally got to grips with the consequences of that legislation.\" To put it mildly, even this kind of timid criticism of Thatcher is unheard of here. But the crowd showed no objection, something as impressive and unexpected in its way as Boris's achievement in getting the London Olympic parade to cheer the name G4S.</p> <p>\u2022 I've learned one other thing too.

He is not in charge of Europe policy, but - in a crowded field - he is one of the most Eurosceptic members of the cabinet and in his speech he said he would not let the EU get involved in welfare decisions.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Now I have to deal with the European commission as they seek to interfere in our welfare arrangements, telling us we will have to pay benefits to anyone from Europe who comes here \u2013 from day one.</p> <p>This will destroy our existing tests which require claimants to live and work in the UK for some time, be job-seeking, or self-sufficient \u2026</p> <p>Ending these tests could cost of a minimum of \u00a3155m or even more.</p> <p>Nation states run their own welfare and we are not prepared to change that.</p> <p>So conference, let me simplify the message for the commission, in case they don\u2019t understand: ils ne passeront pas (they will not pass).</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T15:48:25.358Z\">at 4.48pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5072e9fe58f91d7bbadac0c6\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T14:58:06.809Z\">3.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Eric Pickles' speech - summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Turning back to the conference hall, we've now had speeches from Francis Maude, <strong>Eric Pickles</strong> and Iain Duncan Smith (who is still going).

She said that in her seat she got about 20,000 votes, Labour 18,000 and the Lib Dems 8,000. \"If the Lib Dem vote collapses and a large amount goes to Labour, I would lose my seat.\" Thirty-three of the 40 are in a similar situation. \"We need to be very, very nervous about a Lib Dem collapse,\" she said. \"By all means stick to hugging a hoodie, but please hug the Lib Dems too.\"</p> <p>Matthew Parris, the Times columnist and former Tory MP, disagreed with Rudd's approach. Before previous elections, \"that kind of talk, meetings like this, seemed awfully interesting \u2026 but when the election actually came it was judged by history to have been decided by quite different factors.\" The party the Tory party most had to fear was the Tory party itself, he said. The public understood the need for austerity \"but what people won't forgive is if the Conservative party descends into one of its periods of civil war \u2026 Stop obsessing about Ukip, stop obsessing about the Lib Dems, concentrate on unity. That's the only way to win.\"</p> <p>Jeremy Hunt, the new health secretary, said he agreed with Parris, and thanked him for writing a column saying he couldn't remember why he had once called for Hunt to resign. \"It cheered me up immensely!\" said Hunt. On election day the voters would be asking themselves not \"do I like the feel of Ed Miliband or is David Cameron a toff\" but \"did this group of people do fundamentally important things that other governments have ducked?

Small wages. Bitter cold. Long months of complete darkness. Constant danger. Safe return doubtful. Honour and recognition in case of success.\"</p> <p>The enemy was Labour, Hunt said, but the Tories would be helped by Ed Miliband's taking his party \"decisively to the left\".</p> <p>The panel was asked if the failure of the planned boundary changes was also a big problem for the Tories. Hunt said: \"It's clearly a setback. It's a massive unfairness in the system. It will make the mountain harder to climb.\"</p> <p>When the panel were asked if it would be a good idea to reduce the voting age, one of the delegates interrupted to yell: \"No!

But he could get more money from top rate taxpayers more easily.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It's pretty hard for any government to make serious savings without doing something on welfare. [Osborne has] ruled out a higher rate of income tax ... he's ruled out this big extra increase in housing taxation. What does that leave? It sort of depends on what you mean by the rich.</p> <p>You might mean by the rich that top 1% who pay 50p tax at the moment. If he's not going to do anything with that tax rate then beyond avoidance and evasion measures, there is not a lot you can do unless you're going to do something with wealth or housing.</p> <p>But if by rich you mean the four million or so of us who pay the 40p, then clearly you can do a lot more, including increasing that, increasing national insurance contributions, increasing other bits of council tax.</p> <p>[Osborne] didn't define what he meant by rich which makes it very easy for everyone to think I'm not rich, someone else is going to pay.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Nick Pearce</strong>, the director of the&#xa0;Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), said the Treasury could over time achieve huge savings by raising benefits in line with earnings rather than inflation.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Earnings growth has been weak this year, and using the relevant three-month average figure to July 2012 would mean benefits are uprated by 1.5%, rather than the 2.5% expected level of CPI.</p> <p>This might not look like much, but it will be applied to a baseline of some \u00a350bn of spending, depending on how wide the chancellor casts his net, and the new baseline will then be lower for the uprating in subsequent years - such that, by 2016/17, the government will be making quite large benefit savings.</p> <p>This kind of fiscal drag for the poor is a favourite Treasury manoeuvre to cut social security spending.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T15:59:48.592Z\">at 4.59pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5072ddc4c0e361310bc6c9e0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T14:05:56.899Z\">3.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's some more reaction to the George Osborne speech.</p> <p>From <strong>Craig Bennett</strong>, Friends of the Earth policy and campaigns director:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Generous shale gas tax breaks show the chancellor clearly isn\u2019t listening to the increasingly vociferous warnings from leading politicians, businesses and climate experts about his reckless dash for gas.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Paul Kenny</strong>, the GMB general secretary:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Slashing people's employment rights under the guise of ownership schemes won't create jobs and it won't create growth.</p> <p>His attempts to dupe the electorate that he knows what he is doing have been rumbled. George Osborne has as much knowledge about economics as a stick of rhubarb.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>John Longworth,</strong> director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC):</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Osborne was right to acknowledge that the country must face up to the challenge of global competitiveness through enterprise, effort, aspiration and a real sense of urgency. We face a choice of becoming a Ruritanian museum or a dynamic and prosperous economy, which could be uncomfortable for some in the Conservative party.</p> <p>The chancellor's announcement of a new form of business ownership, with individuals swapping greater employment flexibility for an equity stake in the company, could be a useful option for some new and fast-growing businesses. It is an innovative and imaginative proposal that deserves to be tried out, but it is unlikely to be a game-changer.</p> </blockquote> <p>From<strong> Len McCluskey</strong>, general secretary of Unite:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>George Osborne's repetition of 'we are all in this together' is an insult to millions of families struggling to make ends meet and meaningless to the one in seven children who regularly go without a hot meal. His cuts will turn decent people into desperate people.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Helen Barnard</strong>, programme manager for poverty at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Cutting benefits for groups who receive little public sympathy may make for a good conference speech, but it risks increasing poverty and hardship. And unless there is a follow-up masterplan for creating more and better jobs, massively increasing access to them and sorting out the housing crisis, it's not likely to do as much as those advocating further cuts are hoping to reduce the deficit or people's dependency on the state.</p> </blockquote> <p>From<strong> Campbell Robb</strong>, chief executive of Shelter:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Most under-25s who can live with their parents already do so. Being under 25 is being used as shorthand for people who don\u2019t have responsibilities or adult commitments, whereas in reality more than half of young people who claim housing benefit already have a family of their own. Others have left home to get married, move for job opportunities, or escape serious problems in their family home.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Sarah Jackson</strong>, chief executive of Working Families, a work-life balance charity:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Employers beware. Offering owner employee contracts - where employees effectively sell their employment rights for shares - is unlikely to deliver the highly motivated, engaged workforce you need.</p> <p>Few men or women with family responsibilities would want such a contract and we would advise callers to our free legal helpline to think long and hard before accepting such a one-way deal. Shares can go down as well as up. You could end up with no job security or employment rights and worthless shares.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Fiona Weir,</strong> chief executive of Gingerbread, the charity for single parents:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This announcement [the proposed welfare cuts] comes at a time when families are already struggling, and risks plunging even more children into poverty. It\u2019s vital that we separate fact from fiction. The vast majority of people who receive government support do so because they can\u2019t earn enough to support their families, or even find a job in the first place.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T16:05:57.920Z\">at 5.05pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5072d5db58f91d7bbadac0b7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T13:32:11.866Z\">2.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Nick Clegg</strong> has been talking about the welfare cuts being floated by George Osborne.

(<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/interactive/2012/sep/25/liberaldemocrats-clegg-cameron-miliband-interactive\">You can also see that in this graphic of Guardian/ICM polls since the election</a>.)</p> <p>\"The budget was the worst received budget since the late 1990s,\" said Ipsos Mori's Gideon Skinner. \"Across all ages, across all social classes, across men and women, the Conservative vote has fallen,\" he said. \"They have gone to the left, to the right. You've lost votes to Ukip, but the same number [5%] to Labour. It's not gone just to one wing or one demographic group. The fall is just as much among urban voters as it is among rural.\"</p> <p>\"David Cameron's ratings are falling as well,\" he added. Showing graphs comparing the popularity of incoming prime ministers, he said: \"Cameron's ratings are not a million miles away from where Gordon Brown's were at the same time.\"</p> <p>Ed Miliband, meanwhile, \"has at least steadied the fall\" in his ratings - but all these figures were compiled before the conference speech Miliband made last week that has been widely hailed as an important move towards improving his image.</p> <p>Skinner said of the 2012 budget: \"The rhetoric, the story of 'we're all in it together', it just doesn't resonate with people.\"</p> <p>One chink of light for the Conservatives was that the economy remained the public's number one concern. \"It's all about the economy, the economy, the economy and jobs,\" Skinner said, and the Tories still have a lead over Labour on that issue - albeit only one of 30-25.</p> <p>Fraser Nelson of the Spectator said the budget had been so disastrous for the government not because it was harsh, \"but because it was so comically, shambolically delivered. People just got the general sense that the government doesn't know what it's doing.\"</p> <p>Skinner mentioned in passing that Europe remained low on the public's list of concerns, but Rory Stewart, the Penrith and the Border MP with a colourful background in Iraq and Afghanistan, expressed scepticism about this, given that Cameron's EU \"veto\" in December 2011 had bumped up his personal ratings.</p> <p>\"Let's just focus on Europe for a second,\" he said (in truth, it's never far from the surface here), going on to say that there was a strong argument for an EU referendum given that \"since the 1970s people have not become comfortable with Europe and the politicians have not given people a chance to express that, and this is fundamentally unjust\". He conceded though that this didn't really matter much if people didn't feel strongly about this \"crisis of legitimacy\", as the polls suggest.</p> <p>My impression was that he didn't quite believe the polls on this point, however, and Nelson backed him on this, saying: \"They do [care about Europe]. They care about it a lot.\"</p> <p>Skinner said of Cameron's anti-EU poll boost: \"It was a one-off.

But Osborne said the sentiment still applied.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On the eve of the election, I told this conference: we're all in this together.</p> <p>It was more than a slogan. It spoke of our values and of our intent ...</p> <p>Three years later, my message remains the same:</p> <p>We're not going to get through this as a country if we set one group against another, if we divide, denounce and demonise.</p> <p>We need an effort from each and every one.</p> </blockquote> <p>In another passage in the speech he insisted that the Conservatives were the real one-nation party, although he defined one-nation almost entirely in terms of the group also being defined as \"strivers\".</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We modern Conservatives represent all those who aspire, all who work, save and hope, all who feel a responsibility to put in, not just take out.</p> <p>Whether it's the owner of the corner shop staying open until midnight to support their family.</p> <p>Or the teacher prepared to defy her union and stay late to take the after-school club.</p> <p>Or the commuter who leaves home before the children are up, and comes back long after they have gone to bed, because they want a better life for them.</p> <p>Or the pensioner, who has saved all their life, and doesn't want to spend it all as they want to pass something on to their children.</p> <p>Or the entrepreneur who doesn't cash out and pack up, but devotes their flair and energy to building the next success story.</p> <p>They are all part of one nation, one nation working together to get on.</p> <p>That is the nation we represent.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that, as the government tried to find savings worth \u00a316bn in the next spending round, he wanted 80% of the money to come from spending cuts rather than tax rises (as happened in the last round of spending cuts).</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that he and Iain Duncan Smith had agreed to reduce welfare spending by \u00a310bn by 2015 and he identified three areas where there would be cuts: indexing benefits in line with inflation; housing benefit for the young; benefits for families with several children.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For how can we justify the incomes of those out of work rising faster than the incomes of those in work?</p> <p>How can we justify giving flats to young people who have never worked, when working people twice their age are still living with their parents because they can't afford their first home?</p> <p>How can we justify a system where people in work have to consider the full financial costs of having another child, whilst those who are out of work don't?</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that he had increased taxes overall on the very richest in every budget he had introduced.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In every single year of this parliament the rich will pay a greater share of our nation's tax revenues than in any one of the 13 years that Labour were in office.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that when it came to getting the wealthy to pay more, his priority would be dealing with tax evasion and tax avoidance.</strong></p> <p>He would continue to insist on those with \"the broadest shoulders\" paying the most, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When it comes to the richest, the first place I will look is to those who are still not paying the taxes we expect them to pay today.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said it was unrealistic to cut the size of the public sector any faster than it is already being cut.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We're reducing the size of government, from almost 50% of our national income to 40%, in just five years.</p> <p>I just don't think it's realistic to cut a great deal faster than that.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that the government would not abandon its economic strategy.</strong></p> <p>Edward Heath did in 1972, and the result was \"more inflation, more strikes and the three day week\". Margaret Thatcher held firm in 1981 and she succeeded. Osborne said the government would follow Thatcher.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today, in the face of the great economic challenges of our age we resolve: we will press on and we shall overcome.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the government was \"the most radical and reforming\" for a generation.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that some western countries would become \"poorer and poorer\" in the face of global competition.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Western democracies like ours are being out-worked, out-competed and out-smarted by these new economies.</p> <p>The question for countries like Britain is this: are we going to sink or swim?</p> <p>And the truth is some western countries won't keep up, they won't make the changes needed to welfare and education and tax, they'll fall further and further behind ...<br>&#xa0;<br>... they'll become poorer and poorer.</p> <p>I am determined that will not be the Britain I leave to my children, or you leave to yours.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T15:37:58.637Z\">at 4.37pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5072cbcdc0e361310bc6c9d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T12:49:17.705Z\">1.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's reaction to Osborne's speech from <strong>John Cridland</strong>, the CBI director general.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The chancellor was right to remind Britain that there is no real alternative to deficit reduction.

And he failed to mention growth or set out any policies to deliver the jobs and growth we need to get the deficit down.</p> <p>The reason why George Osborne has been forced to talk about billions more cuts into the next parliament is because his failure to deliver economic growth means he will break his promise to balance the books by 2015. There do need to be savings in the welfare budget, but the benefits bill is soaring under this government because unemployment is so high.</p> <p>He will never be a one nation chancellor when he is pressing ahead with a tax cut for millionaires while asking millions of pensioners and families to pay more.

Our members know what it's like to take tough decisions in order to succeed, and he is right to stick to that path.</p> <p>The IoD applauds his innovative proposal on employee ownership, which could make a real difference to jobs and shareholding. This scheme has the potential to reduce the employment law burden on companies and make employees better off at the same time. The key to the success of the idea will be in encouraging employers and workers to make use of it.</p> <p>The chancellor is also right to hail the potential of shale gas. As we have argued, shale gas represents a really valuable asset, right on our own doorstep.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Chris Leslie</strong>, a shadow Treasury minister:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To hear the chancellor of the exchequer you\u2019d think that all was rosy in the garden, growth was motoring ahead. He didn\u2019t mention unemployment, he didn\u2019t really confront that issue about borrowing actually quite significantly higher \u2013 22% higher this year.

Removing housing benefit from under 25s will make it even more difficult for hard pressed young people to find employment and move on. It is not the answer. Neither is punishing children because a parent is out of work. There is already a welfare cap coming in which places limitations on benefits for large families. These further cuts to the welfare budget could spell disaster for the children and families we support.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Ceri Goddard</strong>, the Fawcett Society\u2019s chief executive:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If the government pursues yet another massive swath of welfare cuts it will be critical, and a legal requirement, that they properly assess and are upfront about how this could further disadvantage women far more than men.</p> <p>If, as seems likely, women will be yet again worst hit when it comes to a further reduction in welfare, the government will either have to properly and publicly justify this or tell us how they intend to mitigate the effects of such a such a skewed impact.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T13:28:53.744Z\">at 2.28pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5072c1d6c0e361310bc6c9ca\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T12:06:46.216Z\">1.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www.cpc12.org.uk/Speeches/George_Osborne.aspx\">The full text of Osborne's speech is now on the Conservative party's conference website.</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-1859f4f6-5ab7-4e59-a15e-d17f73f11a64\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/8/1349701628188/George-Osborne-010.jpg\" alt=\"George Osborne\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The chancellor in full flow.

Priti Patel (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Britannia-Unchained-Global-Lessons-Prosperity/dp/1137032235\">one of the rising stars of the Tory right wing</a>), said that if the European commission president Jose Manuel Barroso \"wants to press ahead with a treaty change before 2015 that is going to be a real wake-up call for our prime minister and our government\".</p> <p>She added: \"We cannot sit back and watch some shoddy deal \u2026 without giving the British public a say.\" This was a \"tremendous opportunity for a British prime minister to rebalance our relationship and put Britain first\".</p> <p>Daniel Hannan, the Tory MEP and popular anti-EU lightning rod, also called for a referendum. He pointed out that in May the combined GDP of the Commonwealth overtook that of the eurozone, and lamented: \"We are obliged to restrict trade with the growing bits of the world in the way that we didn't do in the 1930s.\" Meanwhile, \"Europe is now spiralling down as it mulishly does all the things that have caused it to be in its present predicament.\"</p> <p>The ubiquitous ConservativeHome editor Tim Montgomerie warned that it would be more difficult to win an EU referendum than many anti-Brussels campaigners thought. \"The polls are not as wide in our support as some of us would like to believe. From the AV referendum we know that the British people tend to prefer the status quo unless there is a very good reason to change, and I think that would be the case with either renegotiation or leaving.\"</p> <p>All that was before the anti-EU side had to grapple with the opposition of business and the media and before the EU could make \"cosmetic\" changes to try to head off a UK exit.</p> <p>He added: \"Are we organised for the moment if David Cameron finally - or some other person - gives it to us? Probably at the moment the answer to that question is no.\"</p> <p>Hannan and Patel agreed with all that, but Patrick O'Flynn of the Daily Express, also on the panel, demurred, saying: \"There is no status quo. We're having a fiscal union created.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Correction:</strong> The zombies were anti-euro, not anti-Tory.

But Cameron has done so fast: \"His shelf life has narrowed incredibly,\" says Tim Bale of the University of London, a historian of the modern Conservative party and its troubled post-Thatcher leaders. John Curtice of the University of Strathclyde, a leading authority on voter attitudes, says: \"People used to think Cameron was charismatic. But he is proving to be a kind of average prime minister. His ratings are not terrible, but he's not Thatcher, he's not Blair. He is not a dominant figure. Nobody loves him.

Labour, or his Tory critics, would be foolish to underestimate him. Gordon Brown made that mistake when he became Prime Minister, regarding his opponent as a chinless wonder and privileged weakling. In October 2007, in the week of the infamous election that never was, Mr Cameron bounced back with another powerful peroration: \u201cCall that election. We will fight. Britain will win.\u201d</p> <p>But the reminder of that speech, made five years ago last week, illustrates Mr Cameron\u2019s dilemma. By now his party is used to these last-minute rescue jobs. It knows that Mr Cameron excels at giving speeches in a crisis, when his back is against the wall.

Here are the main points. I've taken the quotes from the Press Association and <a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com\">PoliticsHome.</a></p> <p><strong>\u2022 Osborne has conceded that austerity could last until 2018.</strong><a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2b77439c-0f0d-11e2-9343-00144feabdc0,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F2b77439c-0f0d-11e2-9343-00144feabdc0.html&amp;_i_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fworld%2Fuk\"> Today the Financial Times (paywall) is splashing on a story saying that, based on its own calculation, Britain will not get the deficit under control until then. </a>Asked about this timetable, Osborne said: \"I'm saying, yes, the road is longer than anyone hoped. We've got to find more cuts.\" In a separate interview, when asked about the FT story, Osborne blamed Labour.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Look, who is responsible for creating these debts? I didn't rack up these debts. Ed Balls, who actually wants to take my job, is the man who racked up these debts.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Osborne said the Tories wanted some of the savings to come from welfare and that this was a dividing line with Labour.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Let me be clear, those with the broadest shoulders must bear the broadest burden but our perception of fairness - and this is perhaps where we differ from the Labour party - also extends to the welfare system.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He accused some people of abusing the welfare system.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We also think it is unfair that person leaves their home early in the morning and they pull the door behind them and they are going to do their job and they look at their next-door neighbour, the blinds are down and that family is living a life on benefits. That is unfair as well and we are going to tackle that as part of tackling this country's economic problems.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said he wanted a public debate on whether it was fair to limit child-related benefits available to the unemployed.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"When you are on benefits you automatically get extra money when you have a child, so, you can be better off ... We are just asking the question, does that work? Is that the right value we have in our society?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>He also questioned whether it was fair to pay housing benefit to people who go straight from school onto the dole, and he said the government would propose specific policy measures over the next few months to address these issues.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that advocating a 50p top rate of tax was \"a phoney conception of fairness\".</strong> Under the coalition, the rich were paying more in tax than under Labour, he said. But he abolished the 50p rate because it was making Britain \"uncompetitive\".</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The people who were paying the price for that phoney 50p rate were actually the poor looking for work, not the rich. So I found other ways to tax the rich. We\u2019re clamping down on tax avoidance in a way that has never been done before in this country.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T09:13:05.706Z\">at 10.13am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5072835958f93d334375427c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T07:40:09.442Z\">8.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>AntiAstroturfer in the comments has spotted a wonderful typo in an earlier post.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At 0814, a great typo:</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Q: Shouldn't you admit that you will miss your target to have debt falling by 2015?</p> <p>Osborne says he has cut the budget deficit by 25%.

All of this will require some tough choices, but those choices will be guided by clear principles and a vision of what the welfare system should be.</p> <p>It should be a support for those who need our help but also a system that always requires those who are out of work to make the same kind of choices as those in work.</p> <p>Now we must pose some of the questions we need to answer.

This followed controversy over proposals for a 2bn rand town, the first to be built since the end of apartheid, two miles (3.2km) from the Zuma homestead.</p> <p>\"Nkandlagate\" could not come at a worse time with violent strikes threatening to spread from mining to other industries and focusing attention on the gap between haves and have-nots. Zuma, 70, faces a tense re-election battle within the governing African National Congress in December.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Zuma said: \"I have paid visits to a number of areas where you can't believe that you are in South Africa. Why should I see that, as the president of the country, not even of the ANC, and think that I could sleep peacefully when I know there are people who live in things you can't even describe as a house?\"</p> <p>Those <a href=\"http://www.timeslive.co.za/opinion/editorials/2012/10/08/nkandla-splurge-giving-taxpayers-sleepless-nights\" title=\"\">words are being thrown back at him</a>, with some observers comparing his hometown patronage to some of Africa's least democratic leaders. \"He's behaving like a monarch rather than the president of the republic,\" said Aubrey Matshiqi, a research fellow at the Helen Suzman Foundation. \"It makes me think of the king of Swaziland or Jean-B\u00e9del Bokassa [self-crowned emperor of the Central African Republic].\"</p> <p>Upgrades to Zuma's private residence, which have soared to 238m rand from an estimate of 6.4m (\u00a3447,821) two years ago, include a helipad, underground living quarters with about 10 air-conditioned rooms, a medical clinic for the president and his family, houses for security staff, air force and police units, underground parking, playgrounds and a visitors' centre.</p> <p>Zuma \u2013 who shares the property with his four current wives and their children \u2013 previously said he would meet most of the bill, but government documents revealed he will pay 5%. Taxpayers already maintain two state residences in Pretoria and Cape Town.</p> <p><a href=\"http://mg.co.za/article/2012-10-08-00-nkandla-security-dwarfs-that-of-other-presidents-homes\" title=\"\">Newspaper reports</a> in South Africa said public spending on Zuma's residence dwarfed that for the past presidents FW De Klerk, Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki. Zuma came in for more criticism when his residence was declared a \"national key point\", meaning details are secret under an apartheid-era law.</p> <p>Thuli Madonsela, the public protector, has received several complaints about irregular expenditure on the residence and has begun gathering information which could lead to a full investigation.</p> <p>The civil society group Corruption Watch has also filed questions to the government.</p> <p>The president is already pressure after it emerged in August that ground had been broken for the construction of a new town in the area. Initial estimates show the government will invest more than 1bn rand (\u00a370m) of taxpayers' money, <a href=\"http://mg.co.za/article/2012-08-03-00-taxpayers-will-have-to-pick-up-r1-bn-tab-for-zumaville\" title=\"\">South Africa's Mail &amp; Guardian reported</a>, with a further 1bn rand required from the private sector.</p> <p>The development project, known as the Umlalazi-Nkandla Smart Growth Centre, will reportedly span 200 hectares, enough space for 10,000 middle-class homes. It will include government offices, a library, theatre, a school with boarding facilities, a community safety centre, a recreation centre with a swimming pool and tennis courts and light industrial units including an agricultural market.</p> <p>Residents of Nkandla \u2013 a rural backwater which has an unemployment rate of 47.4% \u2013 have already seen some tangible benefits from having the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/20/zuma-south-africa-politics\" title=\"\">number one citizen in their midst</a>. Julius Malema, the expelled ANC youth league president and Zuma's arch political enemy, has accused himZuma of building a \"New York City of KwaZulu-Natal\".</p> <p>The president has hit back at the criticism, arguing that people should not be penalised for happening to live near him. \"Why should people at Nkandla, 3km from where Zuma stays, starve?\" he <a href=\"http://mg.co.za/article/2012-09-13-jz-denies-instructing-ministers-to-fund-zumaville\" title=\"\">asked parliament</a> last month. \"Why must they be isolated? Why should others who are in other areas be more important than those? Should they be punished because they are neighbours of Zuma? I don't think so.\"</p> <p>The president insisted that he did not personally intervene on behalf of his hometown. \"The president has not instructed ministers to provide funding and a budget for the Nkandla-Mlalazi Smart Growth Centre. It is important to emphasise that even at a national level, Nkandla is not the only district that is receiving attention for rural development.\"</p> <p>But opposition politicians have seized their chance to hammer Zuma's credibility as a former Zulu herd boy still in touch with ordinary people. Lindiwe Mazibuko, parliamentary leader of the Democratic Alliance (DA), said: \"The DA has learnt that thousands of people living on the outskirts of Nkandla, in villages like Babanango, Kataza and Ebizimali, are still without the most basic services. Yet 2bn rand will be spent on a multi-purpose centre a few kilometres away from President Zuma's homestead.\"</p> <p>She added: \"How can a leader ask the country to make sacrifices, and tighten belts in hard times, when he leads such publicly-funded extravagance? This impoverished region of the country needs clinics, hospitals and decent classrooms. He has decided to build them literally in his own backyard. President Zuma's behaviour upends the very concept of social justice which is written into our constitution.\"</p> <p>Political commentators have also excoriated the president. Justice Malala <a href=\"http://www.timeslive.co.za/opinion/columnists/2012/10/08/zuma-is-above-mere-middle-class-morality\" title=\"\">wrote in the Times of South Africa</a>: \"On Friday we had the incredible spectacle of the minister of public works, the until-then-relatively-credible former trade union leader Thulas Nxesi, making a complete ass of himself as he tried to defend the fact that taxpayers' money is being used to build the president a 238m rand palace in his home village, Nkandla.</p> <p>\"When journalists cornered Nxesi he then revealed that, actually, we are judging the president from a middle-class viewpoint. I think the country is going to the dogs when we start saying that looting the state is part of African culture, which is basically what Nxesi was saying.\"</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney's pledge \"to use America's great power to shape history\" is likely to be applauded by those in Israel who interpret it as getting tough with Iran. But any indication that interventionism could extend to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would be much less welcome.</p> <p>Romney's message to Israel was that the US under his leadership would stand shoulder-to-shoulder with its ally, and that the evident personal warmth and ideological similarities between him and Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu would be in marked contrast to Obama's distance and chilliness.</p> <p>\"The relationship between the president of the United States and the prime minister of Israel, our closest ally in the region, has suffered great strains,\" said Romney. \"The president explicitly stated that his goal was to put 'daylight' between the United States and Israel. And he has succeeded. This is a dangerous situation that has set back the hope of peace in the Middle East and emboldened our mutual adversaries, especially Iran.\"</p> <p>Later he added: \"I will reaffirm our historic ties to Israel and our abiding commitment to its security \u2013 the world must never see any daylight between our two nations.\"</p> <p>Some of this is deceptive electioneering. Despite the acute tension between Obama and Netanyahu over the Iranian nuclear programme, the current president has also frequently reaffirmed the historic ties between the two allies, continued a policy of unswerving commitment to Israel's security, threatened to use the US veto against the Palestinians at the United Nations and pumped billions of dollars in military aid to Israel.</p> <p>But \"daylight\" on the Iran issue undoubtedly exists, especially around the issue of \"red lines\" which, if crossed, would trigger US military action. Obama has resisted Netanyahu's pressure to define any red lines. Yet Romney's speech also failed to meet this demand, pointed out Tel Aviv-based analyst Meir Javedanfar.</p> <p>In his speech, Romney pledged to \"put the leaders of Iran on notice that the United States and our friends and allies will prevent them from acquiring nuclear weapons capability\". Obama has repeatedly done the same.</p> <p>Romney went on: \"I will not hesitate to impose new sanctions on Iran and will tighten the sanctions we currently have. I will restore the permanent presence of aircraft carrier task forces in both the eastern Mediterranean and the Gulf region \u2013 and work with Israel to increase our military assistance and coordination. For the sake of peace, we must make clear to Iran through actions \u2013 not just words \u2013 that their nuclear pursuit will not be tolerated.\"</p> <p>Iranian-born Javedanfar said: \"There are two words he didn't say: red line. But he also didn't say he would continue with diplomacy. If Romney stopped talking to the Iranians, it would be very difficult to legitimise new sanctions, and very difficult to keep the Russians and Chinese on board.\"</p> <p>Romney's promise to impose new sanctions and enhance the US military presence in the region were not impressive, said Javedanfar. \"There are going to be new sanctions anyway. US forces are already stationed in Qata, and the fifth fleet is in Bahrain,\" he said, dismissing Romney's pledges as \"cosmetic\".</p> <p>Towards the end of his speech, Romney clarified his position on Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \"I will recommit America to the goal of a democratic, prosperous Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with the Jewish state of Israel. On this vital issue, the president has failed, and what should be a negotiation process has devolved into a series of heated disputes at the United Nations. In this old conflict, as in every challenge we face in the Middle East, only a new President will bring the chance to begin anew.\"</p> <p>This brief statement was an attempt to repair damage caused by the release of video-recorded comments made by the Republican candidate at a fundraising event in May. Then he accused the Palestinians of having no interest in peace and suggested the world needed to learn to live with this \"unsolved problem\".</p> <h2>'Obama has been no more nor less effective than Bush'</h2> <p>Despite suggesting only a new president could solve an old conflict, Romney's speech offered nothing fresh, said independent Palestinian analyst Mouin Rabbani. \"This sounds like what Obama said about his predecessor\".</p> <p>He went on: \"We've got to the point where we're best off not taking seriously any public statements from the US, but rather with a hefty grain of salt. Obama is committed to a negotiated two-state settlement but in practice has done absolutely nothing to promote this framework. Instead the US has used virtually all the instruments in its power to stop it \u2026 and US support for Israel is becoming more uncritical and unconditional.\"</p> <p>Asked if it would make any difference to the Palestinian cause if the world wakes up to a Romney presidency on November 7, Rabbani said: \"I woke up four years ago to an Obama presidency, and I've stayed awake since. If you can identify a substantial difference between Obama and his predecessors, I'd be very eager to hear it.</p> <p>\"If we are genuinely interested in peace in the Middle East, our first priority must be to get past the framework of a US-sponsored bilaterally-negotiated settlement. The US monopoly on this must be challenged. We need to find a different approach in which we don't rely on the US.\"</p> <p>Mark Heller of the Institute of National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University said Obama had indeed failed to advance the goal of a Palestinian state living side by side with an Israeli state, but so had his predecessors, and so probably would Romney.</p> <p>\"The question is: has Obama managed to promote that objective? And the answer is: no, he hasn't. But you could say that about every previous American president and probably every future one, too.</p> <p>\"Too many people over-estimate the power of a US president. Obama has been no more nor less effective than Bush, Clinton or Bush senior.</p> <p>\"The US has a significant and probably indispensable role to play when the circumstances are right. But the circumstances now are not favourable to active and productive US intervention.</p> <p>\"If Romney wins the election, there may be less friction between him and Netanyahu. But fundamentally, I'm not sure it makes that much difference. It's true there have been serious contretemps between Obama and Netanyahu, but fundamentally Obama has stood by Israel in his first term. I don't think a Romney presidency would be fundamentally different or better.\"</p>",
  "<p>The police and army in an increasingly violent Afghanistan will struggle to secure the country when foreign forces leave and the people face a corrupt presidential election in 2014, the Red Cross and a thinktank have warned.</p> <p>At stake is the limited and fragile stability that has insulated Kabul and most other urban areas from more than a decade of escalating aggression since the US invasion. There are growing fears the country could face a full-blown civil war after Nato troops hand over security to the Afghan police and army, and leave.</p> <p>\"Time is running out,\" said Candace Rondeaux of the International Crisis Group thinktank, in a blunt report about the handover from coalition to Afghan troops. \"Steps toward a stable transition must begin now to prevent a precipitous slide toward state collapse.</p> <p>\"Plagued by factionalism and corruption, Afghanistan is far from ready to assume responsibility for security when US and Nato forces withdraw in 2014.\"</p> <p>The Long Hard Road to the 2014 Transition also argues that time is running out to ensure a 2014 presidential vote is credible or acceptable. President Hamid Karzai is due to step down in that year and powerbrokers are already jostling for position.</p> <p>\"It is a near certainty that under current conditions the 2014 elections will be plagued by massive fraud,\" the report stated. \"Vote-rigging in the south and east, where security continues to deteriorate, is all but guaranteed. High levels of violence across the country before and on the day of the polls are likely to disenfranchise hundreds of thousands more would-be voters.\"</p> <p>The last decade has brought improvements for Afghans in areas including women's rights, health and education. But for many civilians, particularly in rural areas, the steady rise of the Taliban and insurgents linked with them has also brought insecurity and misery.</p> <p>\"I am filled with concern as I leave this country,\" the outgoing head of the Afghanistan office of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Reto Stocker, told journalists in Kabul. \"Since I arrived here, in 2005, local armed groups have proliferated, civilians have been caught between not just one but multiple frontlines, and it has become increasingly difficult for ordinary Afghans to obtain healthcare.\"</p> <p>The conflict was now less brutal for civilians, however, than was the fighting that tore Afghanistan apart in the 1990s, when noncombatants were often directly targeted as a deliberate means of warfare, he said.</p> <p>But many were still killed and injured, others had fled their homes to escape violence, and many Afghans who had escaped being drawn into the conflict still lived in abject poverty, extremely vulnerable to drought, flooding, earthquakes and other natural disasters.</p> <p>The fragile economy was also likely to suffer, as the departure of foreign troops would hit a country dependent on war spending, from construction to fuel transportation, Stocker added.</p> <p>\"Hardship arising from the economic situation or from severe weather or natural disaster has become more widespread, and hope for the future has been steadily declining,\" he said.</p> <p>Afghanistan's insecurity also appears to be fuelling its drug control problems. The country is already the world's largest producer of opium, with the UN saying on Monday the number of Afghan families growing cannabis as a cash crop leaped by more than a third last year.</p>",
  "<p>We now have fairly clear evidence that Mitt Romney received a substantial bounce coming out of last Wednesday's debate. So how big was the bounce, why did it occur, why was it surprising, will it last, and what does it mean for the race going forward? </p> <p><strong>1). The post-debate bounce was worth about 3-4 percentage points</strong></p> <p>I've taken a look at <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/pollster/\">all of the latest polls</a> conducted after the debate and compare them to polls prior to the debate. The median shift in those polls is 4 percentage points. You'll notice that some of these polls are from outfits with doubtful reputation (chiefly, Gravis Marketing and We Ask America). Even if you take those polls out, the median shift is still 3 percentage points. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397392099\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/8/1349715354583/toplineshift_220.jpg\" alt=\"Topline post debate shift\" width=\"220\" height=\"216\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>These shifts occurred over a multitude of polling outfits that have had both Democratic and Republican leans this cycle. The shifts have come in both registered and likely voter models. So, the bounce seems very real to me. </p> <p>The numbers also indicate that President Obama and Mitt Romney are likely within a point or two of each other nationally, if the election were held right now. Heading into the debate, Obama held a 3-4 point lead nationally. If you take a look at the national (US) numbers, we're looking at bounces between the pre-debate and current polls of about 2-6 points. This includes Rasmussen, which actually has Romney receding from his post-debate peak into a tie.</p> <p>It's far more difficult to understand where individual states may be at this point because the data is limited. The HuffPollster <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2012-ohio-president-romney-vs-obama\">Ohio aggregate</a>, which takes into account trends from national and other state polls, still gives Obama an edge. In turn, Obama is still favored to win the electoral college. That said, we need more data to be sure.</p> <p><strong>2). The bounce occurred because of Republican enthusiasm and Romney making himself acceptable to the American electorate</strong></p> <p>One of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/04/mitt-romney-won-debate-win-election\">biggest drags</a> on Romney recently had been that Republicans were deflated, while Democrats were filled with helium. Republicans required a good boost and they got it. Republican enthusiasm is up all across the board, including a 10-point increase in <a href=\"publicpolicypolling.com/main/2012/10/obama-leads-by-3-in-virginia.html\">Virginia</a> and an 11-point one in <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2012/10/obama-lead-down-to-2-in-wisconsin.html\">Wisconsin</a>, relative to Democrats. That has big implications because it guarantees what looks to be a fairly substantial Republican turnout advantage, relative to what you would expect if all registered voters casted a ballot. </p> <p>The real shot in the arm for Romney, however, has been that he's crossed the acceptability threshold. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/may/16/2012-race-obama-approvals-romneys-favorables\">In spring I wrote </a> about how voters did not approve of the job Obama was doing, but they didn't like Romney either. Usually, it's down to the conventions either to take care of this favorability problem or not. The Republican national convention did not help Romney much.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397392100\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/8/1349715393398/Favspost_220.jpg\" alt=\"Favorables post debate\" width=\"220\" height=\"146\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The debate has allowed Romney to attain a positive net favorability rating. Beforehand, Romney's <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/mitt-romney-favorability\">net favorability nationwide</a> in the HuffPollster aggregate was at -6 percentage points. The median shift in post-debate polls has been 7.5 percentage points. That's enough to move Romney for the most part into net positive territory.</p> <p>If Romney's favorability boost lasts, then the key electoral question is no longer which candidate do voters like more, but whether they approve or disapprove of the job Obama is doing. </p> <p><strong>3). Debates don't usually change the polls, which makes this one surprising</strong></p> <p>Ask pretty much any political scientist and they will tell you that general election debates <a href=\"http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/septemberoctober_2012/ten_miles_square/do_presidential_debates_really039413.php\">rarely make a difference</a>. The problem, of course, is that we have a very small sample size when it comes to debates. You can argue that the debates <em>did</em> make a difference in 2000, and perhaps also in 2004. </p> <p>Last Wednesday's debate changed the polls for three reasons. First, there were <a href=\"http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/04/presidential-debate-drew-more-than-70-million-viewers/\">70 million people</a> watching it. Second, Gallup has registered Wednesday night's affair as the <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/157907/romney-narrows-vote-gap-historic-debate-win.aspx\">biggest debate win</a> in presidential history. Romney's 50-point margin largely matches the <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/03/cnn-poll-romney-wins-debate-by-big-margin/\">CNN/ORC poll of debate watchers</a>.</p> <p>Anytime a candidate does that well in front of a huge audience, changes are likely to occur. Third, people's opinion of Mitt Romney were soft because he's the challenger. Romney has been pounded on the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/25/barack-obama-advertising_n_1913430.html?utm_hp_ref=elections-2012\">airwaves by negative ads</a>, but it turned out that Debate Mitt was not the Romney people had been seeing on television up until then. </p> <p><strong>4). There are signs Romney's bounce may be fading already</strong></p> <p>Romney had solid polling days on Thursday and Friday, but his polling since then has been decent, at best. <a href=\"http://www.argojournal.com/search/label/Rasmussen\">Rasmussen's Sunday polls</a> find Romney losing ground in Colorado, in Iowa, and nationally. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ppppolls/status/255108708835663872\">Public Policy Polling (PPP) said</a> Romney had his best day on Friday. Saturday and Sunday, on the other hand, looked like PPP's pre-debate polls. <a href=\"http://www.ipsos-na.com/news-polls/pressrelease.aspx?id=5812\">Ipsos and Gallup also have</a> Romney's numbers leveling out, if not receding.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/157907/romney-narrows-vote-gap-historic-debate-win.aspx\">Gallup's Sunday sample in its seven-day polling tracker</a>, which includes pre-debate days, was better for Obama than the pre-debate day it replaced. Obama had been tied with Romney in the post-debate polling sample (see table above), but that was certainly not the case in Sunday's sample \u2013 which has Obama back in the lead.</p> <p>I urge caution in reading too much into the individual days of polling sample, yet it's entirely possible that the debate surge is gone already. John Kerry probably had his greatest boost in the immediate days <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2004/president/us/general_election_bush_vs_kerry-939.html\">following the first 2004 debate</a> \u2013 before falling behind for the rest of the race. We probably should wait for a few more days of polling and see by midweek where we stand now in the 2012 election. </p> <p><strong>5). Either way, Romney has made this a race again \u2013 and could win it</strong></p> <p>This had been one of the steadiest races in presidential history. Hence President Obama's lead, no matter how small, seemed fairly secure. The mere fact that Romney was able to move the polling numbers suggests that he can move them again. The electorate isn't \"locked in\" to re-electing President Obama. President Obama may very well earn a second term; I think he probably will, but that is far from a foregone conclusion. </p> <p>The race right now is probably close enough that any further movement towards Romney on election day would probably lead to him winning.</p>",
  "<p>It is not uncommon to find statistics of dubious quality presented to party political conferences. However, even by the less than rigorous standards that seem to apply at these events, Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson's claim that <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-19868470\" title=\"\">only 12% of Scottish households</a> \"make a net contribution to the economy\" is quite remarkable.</p> <p>By way of supporting analysis, all Tory HQ have seen fit to publish is one brief Excel spreadsheet which desperately needs some narrative explanation. It is not an impressive document.</p> <p>Let's start with the basics: all the information sources cited are out of date. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures from the <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/household-income/the-effects-of-taxes-and-benefits-on-household-income/2009-2010/index.html\" title=\"\">Effects of Taxes and Benefits on Household Income</a> publication are drawn from the 2009/10 release; strange because the <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/household-income/the-effects-of-taxes-and-benefits-on-household-income/2010-11/etb-stats-bulletin-1011.html\" title=\"\">2010/11 data</a> have been available since June this year. Similarly, data from the joint Scottish government/ONS publication, Public Sector Employment in Scotland is taken from the <a href=\"http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2012/06/PSE200612\" title=\"\">Q1 2012 publication</a> and not the <a href=\"http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2012/09/8779\" title=\"\">Q2 data</a> published a month ago. This explains why the figures for public sector employment used in the calculation are wrong; currently 22.2% (23.5% if RBS and HBOS workers are included) of all Scottish workers are employed in the public sector, not 23.8%.</p> <p>Davidson's calculation also references the ONS data on income for all households. In doing so, she commits the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/18/romney-secret-video-government-dependent\" title=\"\">Romney-esque error</a> of failing to account for retired people. This is either lazy or deliberately misleading because the ONS provides such a breakdown in the very document she cites. The income of non-retired households is significantly higher than that for all households and would lead to very different findings.</p> <p>Hilariously, at a time when Davidson's party is campaigning hard for an end to Scotland's universal benefits such as free bus travel for OAPs, free prescriptions and free personal care, the calculation assumes that the distribution in Scotland of \"household income, benefits and taxes is the same as that of UK households\". It isn't. In Scotland, those in the upper income brackets are recipients of additional spend that is lost in her analysis.</p> <p>Also, the process by which Davidson's colleagues have tortured the <a href=\"http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Economy/GERS\" title=\"\">Government expenditure and revenue in Scotland</a> (Gers) data to settle on average benefits and public spend per household figures is, to put it kindly, somewhat vague. I could go on.</p> <p>Of course all this is a helpful distraction from the economic and social devastation her Westminster colleagues are visiting on the Scottish and UK economies. It also reflects an embarrassingly naive view about the nature of economic development in any advanced nation where public and private sectors must interact to generate sustainable growth.</p> <p>The facts of the matter are that Scotland's public spending to GDP ratio is only slightly better or worse than that of the UK as a whole depending on whether or not a geographical share of oil revenues is included in the calculation. Many of the most enduringly successful economies in the world manage to sustain public spending and public sector employment ratios at similar or higher levels.</p> <p>Davidson's grand idea that removal of \"government diktat\" is necessary to unleash Scotland's pent-up private sector potential is simply risible.

Allowing gay marriage would cause deep divisions in society \"without giving gays a single right they do not have in civil partnership\", he said.</p> <p>At a Coalition for Marriage rally on the fringe of the Conservative conference in Birmingham on Monday, Carey joined David Burrowes, the backbench MP for Enfield Southgate, and former MP Ann Widdecombe in protesting that neither the Lib Dem nor Tory 2010 manifesto included a pledge to legalise gay marriage.</p> <p>Carey claimed that in some countries where same-sex marriage had been made legal \u2013 including Mexico, Brazil and the Netherlands \u2013 it had led to unforeseen consequences such as three-person marriages.</p> <p>Asked about opponents of gay marriage being described as \"bigots\" \u2013 on one occasion by Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister \u2013 Carey said: \"Let us remember the Jews in Nazi Germany. What started against them was when they started to be called names.</p> <p>\"And that was the first stage towards that totalitarian state. We have to resist them. We treasure democracy. We treasure our Christian inheritance and we want to debate this in a fair way.\"</p> <p>Widdecombe said: \"This is not an anti-gay rally. It is defending marriage.\"</p> <p>Outside the town hall rally, attended by about 400 people, gay rights protesters accused the platform of promoting \"marriage apartheid\" by denying the right to marry on equal terms.</p> <p>Cameron has joined the US president, Barack Obama, in endorsing same-sex marriage and is poised to report on the results of a 12-week consultation before proceeding to legislate. All main parties, including the SNP government in Edinburgh, now endorse the change.</p> <p>Burrowes urged ministers to stage a referendum on the issue, as has been done in 32 US states with mixed results. He said there had been no pressure for a change to civil partnership before the election \u2013 \"no letters, emails or tweets\" from voters \u2013 but MPs' postbags were now full of the controversy. \"If the government can think again about pasties and caravans it can certainly do so about the important issue of marriage,\" he said.</p> <p>Widdecombe, a former Home Office minister, said such consequences would include the replacement of cherished liturgy and names such as \"mother\" and \"father\" with \"progenitor A and progenitor B\" or \"partners to the marriage\". Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the French president, was proposing to use the word \"carers\", she said.</p> <p>Carey argued that teachers, doctors and other professionals might be forced out of their jobs if they refused to embrace the proposed change to the law, an intolerant restriction on free speech that Widdecombe said could make the Church of England force disestablishment.</p> <p>\"I know, David Cameron, that is not the sort of Britain you want,\" she said.Carey hinted that the prime minister might have conceded the policy on \"pragmatic\" grounds to sustain his coalition with the Lib Dems \u2013 \"the very worst of reasons\".</p> <p>Ben Summerskill, the chief executive of gay rights group Stonewall, said: \"We're deeply saddened that Lord Carey seems to be resorting to student union abuse. The reality is that gay people are very well aware of the consequences of the Holocaust, for obvious reasons, and when someone descends to this level of rhetoric it suggests they don't think they have very powerful arguments to rely on.</p> <p>\"Lord Carey is perfectly entitled to his view and we respect that. It's the view of many people of his generation and we accept that, but to compare Cameron to Hitler is just sad as well as being entirely inappropriate.</p> <p>\"It's extraordinary that he should resort to this sort of invective and profoundly unchristian. There will be gay people of faith who are very disturbed by what he has said.</p> <p>\"The argument is lost already but that doesn't mean the battle won't be a rough one when the time comes. But it is surprising they couldn't come up with a more persuasive argument for this, the apex of their campaign for which they have had had plenty of time to marshall their arguments.\"</p>",
  "<p><em>The following remarks were prepared for delivery:</em></p> <p>\"I particularly appreciate the introduction from my good friend and tireless campaign companion, Gov. Bob McDonnell. He is showing what conservative leadership can do to build a stronger economy. Thank you also Congressman Goodlatte for joining us today. And particular thanks to Gen. Peay. I appreciate your invitation to be with you today at the Virginia Military Institute. It is a great privilege to be here at an Institution that has done so much for our nation, both in war and in peace.<br> For more than 170 years, VMI has done more than educate students. It has guided their transformation into citizens, and warriors, and leaders. VMI graduates have served with honor in our nation's defense, just as many are doing today in Afghanistan and other lands. Since the September 11th attacks, many of VMI's sons and daughters have defended America, and I mourn with you the 15 brave souls who have been lost. I join you in praying for the many VMI graduates and all Americans who are now serving in harm's way. May God bless all who serve, and all who have served. Of all the VMI graduates, none is more distinguished than George Marshall\u2014the Chief of Staff of the Army who became Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense, who helped to vanquish fascism and then planned Europe's rescue from despair. His commitment to peace was born of his direct knowledge of the awful costs and consequences of war. General Marshall once said, \"The only way human beings can win a war is to prevent it.\" Those words were true in his time\u2014and they still echo in ours. Last month, our nation was attacked again. A U.S. Ambassador and three of our fellow Americans are dead\u2014murdered in Benghazi, Libya. Among the dead were three veterans. All of them were fine men, on a mission of peace and friendship to a nation that dearly longs for both. President Obama has said that Ambassador Chris Stevens and his colleagues represented the best of America. And he is right. We all mourn their loss. The attacks against us in Libya were not an isolated incident. They were accompanied by anti-American riots in nearly two dozen other countries, mostly in the Middle East, but also in Africa and Asia. Our embassies have been attacked. Our flag has been burned. Many of our citizens have been threatened and driven from their overseas homes by vicious mobs, shouting \"Death to America.\" These mobs hoisted the black banner of Islamic extremism over American embassies on the anniversary of the September 11th attacks. As the dust settles, as the murdered are buried, Americans are asking how this happened, how the threats we face have grown so much worse, and what this calls on America to do. These are the right questions. And I have come here today to offer a larger perspective on these tragic recent events\u2014and to share with you, and all Americans, my vision for a freer, more prosperous, and more peaceful world.  The attacks on America last month should not be seen as random acts. They are expressions of a larger struggle that is playing out across the broader Middle East\u2014a region that is now in the midst of the most profound upheaval in a century. And the fault lines of this struggle can be seen clearly in Benghazi itself. The attack on our Consulate in Benghazi on September 11th, 2012 was likely the work of forces affiliated with those that attacked our homeland on September 11th, 2001. This latest assault cannot be blamed on a reprehensible video insulting Islam, despite the Administration's attempts to convince us of that for so long. No, as the Administration has finally conceded, these attacks were the deliberate work of terrorists who use violence to impose their dark ideology on others, especially women and girls; who are fighting to control much of the Middle East today; and who seek to wage perpetual war on the West.  We saw all of this in Benghazi last month\u2014but we also saw something else, something hopeful. After the attack on our Consulate, tens of thousands of Libyans, most of them young people, held a massive protest in Benghazi against the very extremists who murdered our people. They waved signs that read, \"The Ambassador was Libya's friend\" and \"Libya is sorry.\" They chanted \"No to militias.\" They marched, unarmed, to the terrorist compound. Then they burned it to the ground. As one Libyan woman said, \"We are not going to go from darkness to darkness.\" This is the struggle that is now shaking the entire Middle East to its foundation. It is the struggle of millions and millions of people\u2014men and women, young and old, Muslims, Christians and non-believers\u2014all of whom have had enough of the darkness. It is a struggle for the dignity that comes with freedom, and opportunity, and the right to live under laws of our own making. It is a struggle that has unfolded under green banners in the streets of Iran, in the public squares of Tunisia and Egypt and Yemen, and in the fights for liberty in Iraq, and Afghanistan, and Libya, and now Syria. In short, it is a struggle between liberty and tyranny, justice and oppression, hope and despair. We have seen this struggle before. It would be familiar to George Marshall. In his time, in the ashes of world war, another critical part of the world was torn between democracy and despotism. Fortunately, we had leaders of courage and vision, both Republicans and Democrats, who knew that America had to support friends who shared our values, and prevent today's crises from becoming tomorrow's conflicts. Statesmen like Marshall rallied our nation to rise to its responsibilities as the leader of the free world. We helped our friends to build and sustain free societies and free markets. We defended our friends, and ourselves, from our common enemies. We led. And though the path was long and uncertain, the thought of war in Europe is as inconceivable today as it seemed inevitable in the last century. This is what makes America exceptional: It is not just the character of our country\u2014it is the record of our accomplishments. America has a proud history of strong, confident, principled global leadership\u2014a history that has been written by patriots of both parties. That is America at its best. And it is the standard by which we measure every President, as well as anyone who wishes to be President. Unfortunately, this President's policies have not been equal to our best examples of world leadership. And nowhere is this more evident than in the Middle East.  I want to be very clear: The blame for the murder of our people in Libya, and the attacks on our embassies in so many other countries, lies solely with those who carried them out\u2014no one else. But it is the responsibility of our President to use America's great power to shape history\u2014not to lead from behind, leaving our destiny at the mercy of events. Unfortunately, that is exactly where we find ourselves in the Middle East under President Obama. The relationship between the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of Israel, our closest ally in the region, has suffered great strains. The President explicitly stated that his goal was to put \"daylight\" between the United States and Israel. And he has succeeded. This is a dangerous situation that has set back the hope of peace in the Middle East and emboldened our mutual adversaries, especially Iran. Iran today has never been closer to a nuclear weapons capability. It has never posed a greater danger to our friends, our allies, and to us. And it has never acted less deterred by America, as was made clear last year when Iranian agents plotted to assassinate the Saudi Ambassador in our nation's capital. And yet, when millions of Iranians took to the streets in June of 2009, when they demanded freedom from a cruel regime that threatens the world, when they cried out, \"Are you with us, or are you with them?\"\u2014the American President was silent. Across the greater Middle East, as the joy born from the downfall of dictators has given way to the painstaking work of building capable security forces, and growing economies, and developing democratic institutions, the President has failed to offer the tangible support that our partners want and need.  In Iraq, the costly gains made by our troops are being eroded by rising violence, a resurgent Al-Qaeda, the weakening of democracy in Baghdad, and the rising influence of Iran. And yet, America's ability to influence events for the better in Iraq has been undermined by the abrupt withdrawal of our entire troop presence. The President tried\u2014and failed\u2014to secure a responsible and gradual drawdown that would have better secured our gains. The President has failed to lead in Syria, where more than 30,000 men, women, and children have been massacred by the Assad regime over the past 20 months. Violent extremists are flowing into the fight. Our ally Turkey has been attacked. And the conflict threatens stability in the region. America can take pride in the blows that our military and intelligence professionals have inflicted on Al-Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan, including the killing of Osama bin Laden. These are real achievements won at a high cost. But Al-Qaeda remains a strong force in Yemen and Somalia, in Libya and other parts of North Africa, in Iraq, and now in Syria. And other extremists have gained ground across the region. Drones and the modern instruments of war are important tools in our fight, but they are no substitute for a national security strategy for the Middle East. The President is fond of saying that \"The tide of war is receding.\" And I want to believe him as much as anyone. But when we look at the Middle East today\u2014with Iran closer than ever to nuclear weapons capability, with the conflict in Syria threating to destabilize the region, with violent extremists on the march, and with an American Ambassador and three others dead likely at the hands of Al-Qaeda affiliates\u2014 it is clear that the risk of conflict in the region is higher now than when the President took office. I know the President hopes for a safer, freer, and a more prosperous Middle East allied with the United States. I share this hope. But hope is not a strategy. We cannot support our friends and defeat our enemies in the Middle East when our words are not backed up by deeds, when our defense spending is being arbitrarily and deeply cut, when we have no trade agenda to speak of, and the perception of our strategy is not one of partnership, but of passivity.  The greater tragedy of it all is that we are missing an historic opportunity to win new friends who share our values in the Middle East\u2014friends who are fighting for their own futures against the very same violent extremists, and evil tyrants, and angry mobs who seek to harm us. Unfortunately, so many of these people who could be our friends feel that our President is indifferent to their quest for freedom and dignity. As one Syrian woman put it, \"We will not forget that you forgot about us.\" It is time to change course in the Middle East. That course should be organized around these bedrock principles: America must have confidence in our cause, clarity in our purpose and resolve in our might. No friend of America will question our commitment to support them\u2026 no enemy that attacks America will question our resolve to defeat them\u2026 and no one anywhere, friend or foe, will doubt America's capability to back up our words. I will put the leaders of Iran on notice that the United States and our friends and allies will prevent them from acquiring nuclear weapons capability. I will not hesitate to impose new sanctions on Iran, and will tighten the sanctions we currently have. I will restore the permanent presence of aircraft carrier task forces in both the Eastern Mediterranean and the Gulf region\u2014and work with Israel to increase our military assistance and coordination. For the sake of peace, we must make clear to Iran through actions\u2014not just words\u2014that their nuclear pursuit will not be tolerated. I will reaffirm our historic ties to Israel and our abiding commitment to its security\u2014the world must never see any daylight between our two nations. I will deepen our critical cooperation with our partners in the Gulf. And I will roll back President Obama's deep and arbitrary cuts to our national defense that would devastate our military. I will make the critical defense investments that we need to remain secure. The decisions we make today will determine our ability to protect America tomorrow. The first purpose of a strong military is to prevent war. The size of our Navy is at levels not seen since 1916. I will restore our Navy to the size needed to fulfill our missions by building 15 ships per year, including three submarines. I will implement effective missile defenses to protect against threats. And on this, there will be no flexibility with Vladimir Putin. And I will call on our NATO allies to keep the greatest military alliance in history strong by honoring their commitment to each devote 2 percent of their GDP to security spending. Today, only 3 of the 28 NATO nations meet this benchmark. I will make further reforms to our foreign assistance to create incentives for good governance, free enterprise, and greater trade, in the Middle East and beyond. I will organize all assistance efforts in the greater Middle East under one official with responsibility and accountability to prioritize efforts and produce results. I will rally our friends and allies to match our generosity with theirs. And I will make it clear to the recipients of our aid that, in return for our material support, they must meet the responsibilities of every decent modern government\u2014to respect the rights of all of their citizens, including women and minorities\u2026 to ensure space for civil society, a free media, political parties, and an independent judiciary\u2026 and to abide by their international commitments to protect our diplomats and our property. I will champion free trade and restore it as a critical element of our strategy, both in the Middle East and across the world. The President has not signed one new free trade agreement in the past four years. I will reverse that failure. I will work with nations around the world that are committed to the principles of free enterprise, expanding existing relationships and establishing new ones. I will support friends across the Middle East who share our values, but need help defending them and their sovereignty against our common enemies. In Libya, I will support the Libyan people's efforts to forge a lasting government that represents all of them, and I will vigorously pursue the terrorists who attacked our consulate in Benghazi and killed Americans.  In Egypt, I will use our influence\u2014including clear conditions on our aid\u2014to urge the new government to represent all Egyptians, to build democratic institutions, and to maintain its peace treaty with Israel. And we must persuade our friends and allies to place similar stipulations on their aid. In Syria, I will work with our partners to identify and organize those members of the opposition who share our values and ensure they obtain the arms they need to defeat Assad's tanks, helicopters, and fighter jets. Iran is sending arms to Assad because they know his downfall would be a strategic defeat for them. We should be working no less vigorously with our international partners to support the many Syrians who would deliver that defeat to Iran\u2014rather than sitting on the sidelines. It is essential that we develop influence with those forces in Syria that will one day lead a country that sits at the heart of the Middle East.  And in Afghanistan, I will pursue a real and successful transition to Afghan security forces by the end of 2014. President Obama would have you believe that anyone who disagrees with his decisions in Afghanistan is arguing for endless war. But the route to more war \u2013 and to potential attacks here at home \u2013 is a politically timed retreat that abandons the Afghan people to the same extremists who ravaged their country and used it to launch the attacks of 9/11. I will evaluate conditions on the ground and weigh the best advice of our military commanders. And I will affirm that my duty is not to my political prospects, but to the security of the nation. Finally, I will recommit America to the goal of a democratic, prosperous Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with the Jewish state of Israel. On this vital issue, the President has failed, and what should be a negotiation process has devolved into a series of heated disputes at the United Nations. In this old conflict, as in every challenge we face in the Middle East, only a new President will bring the chance to begin anew. There is a longing for American leadership in the Middle East\u2014and it is not unique to that region. It is broadly felt by America's friends and allies in other parts of the world as well\u2014 in Europe, where Putin's Russia casts a long shadow over young democracies, and where our oldest allies have been told we are \"pivoting\" away from them \u2026 in Asia and across the Pacific, where China's recent assertiveness is sending chills through the region \u2026 and here in our own hemisphere, where our neighbors in Latin America want to resist the failed ideology of Hugo Chavez and the Castro brothers and deepen ties with the United States on trade, energy, and security. But in all of these places, just as in the Middle East, the question is asked: \"Where does America stand?\" I know many Americans are asking a different question: \"Why us?\" I know many Americans are asking whether our country today\u2014with our ailing economy, and our massive debt, and after 11 years at war\u2014is still capable of leading.  I believe that if America does not lead, others will\u2014others who do not share our interests and our values\u2014and the world will grow darker, for our friends and for us. America's security and the cause of freedom cannot afford four more years like the last four years. I am running for President because I believe the leader of the free world has a duty, to our citizens, and to our friends everywhere, to use America's great influence\u2014wisely, with solemnity and without false pride, but also firmly and actively\u2014to shape events in ways that secure our interests, further our values, prevent conflict, and make the world better\u2014not perfect, but better.  Our friends and allies across the globe do not want less American leadership. They want more\u2014more of our moral support, more of our security cooperation, more of our trade, and more of our assistance in building free societies and thriving economies. So many people across the world still look to America as the best hope of humankind. So many people still have faith in America. We must show them that we still have faith in ourselves\u2014that we have the will and the wisdom to revive our stagnant economy, to roll back our unsustainable debt, to reform our government, to reverse the catastrophic cuts now threatening our national defense, to renew the sources of our great power, and to lead the course of human events. Sir Winston Churchill once said of George Marshall: \"He \u2026 always fought victoriously against defeatism, discouragement, and disillusion.\" That is the role our friends want America to play again. And it is the role we must play.  The 21st century can and must be an American century. It began with terror, war, and economic calamity. It is our duty to steer it onto the path of freedom, peace, and prosperity.  The torch America carries is one of decency and hope. It is not America's torch alone. But it is America's duty \u2013 and honor \u2013 to hold it high enough that all the world can see its light. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.\"</p>",
  "<p>ProfJohn <a href=\"http://www.hagelin.org/about.html\" title=\"\">Hagelin</a>'s decision not to run against Mitt Romney and Barack Obama left this year's US presidential race without a major candidate who is a scientist and who acknowledges \u2013 publicly \u2013 his ability to both counteract gravity and prevent crime.</p> <p>Two decades ago, Hagelin and a team of fellow scientists performed a bold experiment. Their aim was to drastically reduce the amount of violent crime in Washington DC \u2013 a metropolis then noted for its high incidence of murder, rape and robbery. The Hagelin method was to systematically blanket the city with mental emanations from transcendental meditation and yogic flying.</p> <p>Hagelin is, by his own admission, a remarkable man. A professor of physics and director of the Institute of Science, Technology and Public Policy at the <a href=\"http://www.mum.edu/\" title=\"\">Maharishi University of Management</a>, in Fairfield, Iowa, he is a practised expert in quantum physics, transcendental meditation and yogic flying.</p> <p>Hagelin ran for president in 1992, 1996 and 2000, as the Natural Law Party's designated candidate. He was not elected in any of those years. In the <a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/2000presgeresults.htm\" title=\"\">election of 2000</a>, he lost to George W Bush by only 50,372,288 votes and to Al Gore by 50,916,183 votes. The Natural Law Party, based at the <a href=\"http://istpp.org/\" title=\"\">Institute of Science, Technology and Public Policy</a>, has since closed its national office.</p> <p>In 1993 Hagelin invented his crime-prevention recipe. His method consists of \"forming coherence groups in major cities to lower the stress throughout our society, in order to alleviate the prime cause of criminality\". In plain words, he pays people to meditate, and levitate themselves off carpets. When a sufficient number of skilled people do this at the same time and in the same place, the crime rate drops. It's a simple as that.</p> <p>Hagelin demonstrated this anti-crime technique in the summer of 1993. From 7 June to 30 July, 4,000 trained meditators meditated and levitated in or near Washington DC.</p> <p>At a press conference the following year, just weeks before the presidential election, candidate Hagelin announced the <a href=\"http://www.pnyv.org/fileadmin/images_articles/reports/Tm-Maharishi-Study.pdf\" title=\"\">results</a> of the experiment: it was a success. While the meditators were meditating and levitating, Washington's crime rate dropped by 18%.</p> <p>This was a fact. The crime rate did drop by 18%. However, the rate that dropped by 18% was not the number of crimes actually committed \u2013 in fact, during the experiment, Washington's weekly murder count hit the highest level ever recorded. The 18% drop was from Hagelin's computer prediction of what would have happened had his meditators not been meditating and levitating.</p> <p>For his influence on criminals, John Hagelin was awarded the 1994 <a href=\"http://www.improbable.com/ig/winners/#ig1994\" title=\"\">Ig Nobel Peace Prize</a>.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Marc Abrahams is organiser of the Ig Nobel prizes and editor of the Annals of Improbable Research</p>",
  "<p>Vladimir Putin has said the three jailed members of the anti-Kremlin punk band Pussy Riot \"got what they asked for\", days before a Moscow court is due to consider their appeal.</p> <p>\"It was right that they were arrested, and the court's decision was right,\" Putin told a journalist at NTV, a state-run television channel, during an hour-long documentary aired in honour of his 60th birthday on Sunday.</p> <p>Maria Alyokhina, 24, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, 22, and Yekaterina Samutsevich, 30, have been held in a Moscow detention centre since their arrest in March. They were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/17/pussy-riot-sentenced-two-years\" title=\"\"><br>sentenced to two years in prison</a> in mid-August on charges of \"hooliganism motivated by religious hatred\" after performing an anti-Putin \"punk prayer\" in a Moscow cathedral. They are to appeal against the sentence on Wednesday.</p> <p>A lawyer for the women, Nikolai Polozov, said Putin's comments were part of \"a planned propaganda campaign aimed at getting the court to form a negative opinion\" in the appeal case. \"This is pressure on the court.\" He compared it to comments Putin made before the sentencing on 17 August, when the powerful president said he thought the women should not be judged \"too harshly\". They were subsequently handed a two-year sentence instead of a possible seven.</p> <p>Putin claimed on NTV that he had played no role in the case. \"I have nothing to do with it,\" he said. \"They got what they asked for.\"</p> <p>The three women have been held in a Moscow detention centre since their arrest in early March. They have apologised for offending Russian Orthodox believers, but have insisted that their performance was a political act.</p> <p>Putin initially reacted to a question about the band with visible disgust and a laugh, asking the journalist, Vadim Takmenyov, whether he knew how to translate their name \u2013 Takmenyov said he could not say the word in front of Putin.</p> <p>\"You see, if you can't say it in front of me, it means it's an indecent word. These girls must be talented \u2013 they forced you all to say that word,\" Putin replied. \"Is that normal?\"</p> <p>\"One must not erode our moral foundation and undermine the country. What would be left then?\" the president wondered.</p> <p>The New Times, an independent magazine, aired a video on its website on Monday of Tolokonnikova inside her cell, a dingy green room stacked with bunk beds, blankets and a pile of boxes of milk. She is asked if she has enough books to relax and replies: \"I don't want to relax, my whole life is devoted to work.\" The women have remained defiant throughout their case.</p> <p>Putin used his birthday documentary as a chance to rubbish Russia's opposition movement, saying: \"There are many here who don't want Russia to get stronger.\".</p> <p>When asked if he followed polls \u2013 which show that Putin's popularity has slipped from heights that regularly had him polling at 70% approval ratings \u2013 the president said: \"I have a chemical, an internal feeling, in the correctness of what I'm doing.\" Putin's latest approval ratings have fallen to a post-election low of 37% in one survey and even pro-government pollsters only have him at 48%.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama's campaign team has accused Mitt Romney of wanting to pursue the same kind of foreign policy as George Bush that led the US into wars.</p> <p>The president's campaign claimed the Republican presidential candidate is positioning himself to the right of Bush on foreign policy with a speech Romney is due to make later today.</p> <p>Extracts of Romney's speech were released on Sunday and outlined mainly his position on the Middle East, provoking claims that he has been repeatedly shifting his line on Libya, Syria, the Palestinian territories and Iran.</p> <p>On Syria, Romney and his team have offered competing views on how far or how little the US should become involved. Unlike the Obama administration, which has so far resisted allowing rebels to receive arms capable of countering jets, tanks and helicopters, Romney is proposing that US allies in the Middle East lift those restrictions and start supplying the rebels with the arms they have been asking for.</p> <p>The Obama campaign issued an ad saying Romney had already failed the commander-in-chief test, citing his accident-prone tour of the UK, Israel and Poland in the summer and various comments since then. The ad says: \"If this is how he handles the world now, just think of what Romney might do as president.\"</p> <p>The Obama team released a 'memo' \u2013 in reality a press release&#xa0;\u2013 from two of its foreign policy advisers, Michele Flournoy and Colin Kahl, saying that Romney's speech is an attempt to reboot his foreign policy but that \"doesn't change the fact that he's repeatedly taken positions outside the mainstream and often to the right of even George Bush\".</p> <p>The pair add: \"This is not surprising, given that Romney is advised by the same people who were responsible for some of the worst foreign policy failures in American history, including the Iraq war. And now he wants to take us back to the same with-us-or-against-us approach that got us into wars without getting us out of them.\"</p> <p>Flournoy and Kahl said Romney had so far failed to provide details on the big foreign policy issues, such as what he would do differently from Obama in dealing with Iran's alleged pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability.</p> <p>An Obama campaign spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, said: \"We're not going to be lectured by someone who has been an unmitigated disaster on foreign policy every time he's dipped his toe in the foreign policy waters.\"</p> <p>This will be Romney's seventh foreign policy speech, with most of the earlier ones being heavily criticised for lack of content.</p> <p>On CNN on Monday morning, the news anchor Soledad O'Brien engaged in a series of testy exchanges with a Romney media spokeswoman, Tara Wall, over his position on the Palestinian territories. In the secret video released last month of a private speech in Florida, Romney was dismissive of the chances of resolving the Israeli-Palestinian issue, but in the extracts of the speech to be delivered later in Virginia, he talks up the need for an independent Palestinian state. In the secret video, Romney said the Palestinians were not interested in the pursuit of peace and that an independent Palestine could be used by Iran as a launchpad for attacks on Israel.</p> <p>O'Brien asked Wall which of the two positions Romney was advocating, creation of a Palestinian state or scepticism about the prospect.</p> <p>Wall responded that Obama had appeared on an entertainment programme rather than meet the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, in New York last month.</p> <p>\"Hold on, just hold,\" said O'Brien. \"My point is: it's completely contradictory. So my question is: which is it? OK, then tell me how it's not completely contradictory in your viewpoint, but don't talk about President Obama at this moment. Answer the question about Governor Romney.\"</p> <p>Wall said it was not her personal role to debate foreign policy and suggested putting on foreign affairs experts and \"let them go at it and pick this apart the way that you would like to have it picked apart.\"</p> <p>\"That's unfair,\" O'Brien replied. \"I'm just asking you about your message. That's unfair. I'm only asking you about a contradictory message.\"</p> <p>Wall said she rejected the idea that the message is contradictory.</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney is signalling a more active policy on the Syrian uprising than Barack Obama, calling explicitly for weapons deliveries to rebel forces and framing the conflict in geostrategic terms as one which can lead to defeat for Iran, Bashar al-Assad's principal ally.</p> <p>But the Republican candidate is also careful to stress the need to work with partners to \"identify and organise\" those members of the opposition \"who share our values.\" Only they will obtain the arms they need. And the US will not act alone.</p> <p>Clearly, defeating Assad's \"tanks, helicopters, and fighter jets\" will require more than the mostly light weapons that have been smuggled into Syria, via middlemen who work with the Gulf states and Turkey and are reportedly monitored and facilitated by the CIA. Anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons would probably make a big difference.</p> <p>But there is no mention of the US taking any action on the ground, involving the \"safe zones\" or \"humanitarian corridors\" the fragmented Syrian opposition would like to see.</p> <p>Romney's forward remarks on Syria also reference US and western concerns about the growing strength of Islamist and jihadi-type groups on the ground. By suggesting that Obama is \"sitting on the sidelines\" the Republican also signals a readiness to look beyond Assad to \"develop influence with those forces in Syria that will one day lead a country that sits at the heart of the Middle East\".</p> <p>On wider Middle Eastern issues, Romney seeks to establish his credentials as a clear-eyed enemy of terrorism, attacking Obama for his \"passivity\". On Libya he promises to \"vigorously pursue the terrorists who attacked our consulate in Benghazi and killed Americans\". The implication, again, is that \"vigour\" is lacking.</p> <p>On Egypt, at the heart of the dramatic changes of the Arab spring over the past 18 months, Romney signals readiness to make continuing US aid conditional on inclusiveness \u2013 in a coded reference to the Islamist-led government and minority rights \u2013 and maintaining the 1979 peace treaty with Israel.</p> <p>Tough talk on Iran includes the promise of \"new sanctions\" and a readiness to take unspecified actions. \"For the sake of peace, we must make clear to Iran through actions \u2013 not just words \u2013 that their nuclear pursuit will not be tolerated,\" Romney said. Specifically, he calls for the restoration of \"the permanent presence of aircraft carrier task forces in both the eastern Mediterranean and the Gulf region\" and working \"with Israel to increase our military assistance and coordination\".</p>",

Used as it is as a multisecond snapshot of popular culture, is an expression of the hive mind at work, an all-knowing, all-seeing, all-creating collective brain self-referencing for only one reason: because it can. And, for better or worse, it might change how we see our politicians.</p> <p>Last week's presidential debate didn't have a moment quite as gif-able as, say, <a href=\"http://s.buzzfeed.com/raw/bush-shoe-throw/bush-shoe-throw-03.gif\" title=\"\">President Bush's face-off with a flying shoe</a> </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397383839\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/8/1349688482749/bush-shoe-throw-03.gif\" alt=\"bush\" width=\"340\" height=\"240\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>for which there were a number of <a href=\"http://s.buzzfeed.com/raw/bush-shoe-throw/bush-shoe-throw-14.gif\" title=\"\">alternate realities</a> created by internet denizens and collected on Buzzfeed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397383840\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/8/1349688510750/bush-shoe-throw-14.gif\" alt=\"bush gif\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p> But it was only a starting point. Perhaps soon, a candidate could succeed or fail not on the strength of their zingers during a debate, but on the gifs they generate afterwards.</p> <p>At worst, some gifs might be meaningless or useless, if knowingly so. But at best, they can be the quickest, most effective form of satire we've yet come across. It's an instant piece of commentary, delivering the setup and punchline simultaneously. And it lives forever inside the collective cultural brain, rolling over and over into perpetuity. We've probably passed the point now of the soundbite and not just because sound is no longer needed. The gif, endlessly looping, replays the same scene forever and ever, thus outdoing the soundbite with its quaint finite format.</p> <p>Into this landscape walked Mitt Romney, by his own design an image of abstracted self-satire, already purposefully appearing like a high-definition, digitally rendered image of what an American president ought to look like were he to be carefully coded for the next big budget animated feature. And he begged to be gif-ed.</p> <p>There's really nothing to it. You can cut a Romney clip from the debate footage from Wednesday night, build a gif subtitled with a phrase like, \"<a href=\"http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbch1rKmzl1rg2rf7o1_500.gif\" title=\"\">I like coal</a>\" and walk away. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397383841\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/8/1349697472744/ilikecoal.gif\" alt=\"i like coal\" width=\"500\" height=\"230\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Or, mystifyingly, have him eat a <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/AASSH.gif\" title=\"\">corn dog</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397383842\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/8/1349697495848/mii_corn_dog.gif\" alt=\"coen dog gif\" width=\"504\" height=\"336\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Or have him dance, <a href=\"http://cdn.iwastesomuchtime.com/1062012001320ZM9m6.gif\" title=\"\">gangnam style</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397383843\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/8/1349697533817/mitt_dance.gif\" alt=\"mitt dance\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The effect differs with the context but, essentially, Romney's evening of debate was a series of endlessly gif-able moments, whether they stood out as instances of political expression, or just ripe for rather silly, pointless ridicule.</p> <p>It was different for Barack Obama. During last week's debate, the president either seemed to be talking from miles away or, when he was talking at all, was like a policy wonk with a photographic memory, reciting the latest White House economic briefing memo he just read in the toilet. His extremes were gif-able, but that was about it. </p> <p>Either he was <a href=\"http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbcgtkIZSc1rg2rf7o1_500.gif\" title=\"\">asleep</a>, </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397383844\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/8/1349688621366/tumblr_mbcgtkIZSc1rg2rf7o1_500.gif\" alt=\"gif\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p> <a href=\"http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbckiovqau1rg2rf7o3_250.gif\" title=\"\">babbling endlessly</a> or <a href=\"http://techstroke.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/lightsaber.gif\" title=\"\">brandishing a lightsaber</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397383845\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/8/1349697579882/lightsaber.gif\" alt=\"light saber\" width=\"500\" height=\"274\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Source: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/04/romney-obama-debate-live-gifs\">Guardian/Tumblr</a></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> So what? Maybe it's nothing, but while the post-debate gifs mostly centred on Romney, ridiculing his phrases and generally pointing out the problems he has as a candidate, the lasting cultural images of him will at least feature the messages he set out to project. His quotes were used. The words might appear in neon flashing lights or as satire, but there they are. His phrases were remembered, if only as part of a carnival internet sideshow. By contrast, not only was Obama entirely less memorable, but the internet considered him to have ultimately been completely silent. As far as the gifs are concerned, he might as well have said nothing at all. For a man running to be president again, that cannot be good.</p>",
  "<p>At the end of the second world war, the western allies shared an understandable desire to cement lasting international peace after a conflict that had cost so many lives. One of the most effective ways of achieving this, it was believed, was to ensure the economic growth of all countries. The ideas of US economic historian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/feb/17/guardianobituaries.usa\" title=\"\">Walt W Rostow</a>, particularly those in his 1960 book, <a href=\"https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/ipe/rostow.htm\" title=\"\">The Stages of Economic Growth</a>, represented one of the most influential attempts to systematise these thoughts.</p> <p>The product of a decade's work, the book gives us post-second world war development economics in a nutshell \u2013 or rather in the silver sweep of a DC-8 airliner cabin, since Rostow's primary analogy was that of \"take off\": an aeronautical rendering of the moment when, with sufficient capital and other preconditions in place, \"the old blocks and resistances to steady growth are finally overcome\".</p> <p>For Rostow, encouraging this process meant promoting new \"enclaves of modern activity\" that could be economically fused together to become the nation's \"normal condition \u2026 built, as it were, into its habits and institutional structure\".</p> <p>Like other modernisation theories, The Stages of Economic Growth was both a diffusionist and technocratic doctrine, since it sought to replicate within more traditional societies the benefits of rationality and progress already experienced in the wealthier parts of the world. It was an approach to development in which a group of experts sitting in their government offices would call forth the machinery of industrialisation and urbanisation to remake social relations on the ground.</p> <p>If this paternalist rendering of the economic trajectory of nations had a clear moral compass, it had a clear political compass too \u2013 just look at the book's subtitle: An Anti-Communist Manifesto. This brings home an important point about development: its inherently political nature. Development policy from the <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/marshall_plan/\" title=\"\">Marshall plan</a> onwards was a form of cold war ideological arm-wrestling. It allowed Soviets and Americans to test who had the better theories for social and economic progress in the Petri dish of the \"third world\", as it was then known, while allowing them to lay claim to the world's political space without wading into wholesale colonialism in the process.</p> <p>A graduate of Yale at the precocious age of 19, a contributor to the Marshall plan, and a speechwriter for President Dwight Eisenhower \u2013 in addition to being a tenured economist \u2013 Rostow was one of the brightest minds to challenge the USSR. When, in 1960, after reading The Stages of Economic Growth, John F Kennedy recruited the hawkish young Rostow to his election team, he would have his chance.</p> <p>Kennedy bought wholesale into what became known as the \"Rostow doctrine\", and the decade that followed \u2013 the first <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/sowc96/1960s.htm\" title=\"\">decade of development</a> in UN parlance \u2013 ensured that Rostow's ideas about modernisation spread far and wide.</p> <p>In the early 1960s the two-year-old Cuban revolution switched first its sugar quota and then its political allegiance from the US to the Soviet Union, helping Rostow's cause by reminding the US what was at stake in its dealings with the developing world. It helped him to promote Kennedy's flagship <a href=\"http://www.jfklibrary.org/JFK/JFK-in-History/Alliance-for-Progress.aspx\" title=\"\">Alliance for Progress in Latin America</a>, and then, under Lyndon Johnson, to justify US military policy in Vietnam.</p> <p>For Rostow, aid was always a weapon: something to be targeted rather than delivered. But for all his hawkishness over Vietnam he was adamant, too, that America's political ambitions were ultimately best pursued \"crabwise\", as he put it, through specific policies and programmes.</p> <p>However, within a year of Rostow's book being published, some of those developing nations, tired of being scrapped over in a struggle not of their own making, clubbed together to form the <a href=\"http://www.nam.gov.za/background/background.htm\" title=\"\">Non-Aligned Movement</a>: the first attempt to create a political bloc in the developing world.</p> <p>Even at its point of greatest influence, then, there was resistance to the politically laden and overdetermining visions of utopia in which modernisation theorists like Rostow traded. And by the end of the 1960s, Rostow was unceremoniously put out to grass: felled in the end by his unflinching commitment to the war in Vietnam. But there is no doubting that, until then, Rostow stood firmly at the helm of the burgeoning field of international development.</p> <p>Today the ideas, practice and perhaps especially the politics of development have moved on. Rostow's brash optimism (though maybe not his hawkishness) seems somehow out of place in our post-millennial world of \"poverty reduction\" and \"complex humanitarian emergencies\". Certainly most practitioners today, though not all, are more wary of assuming European and American history to be the norm, or of reading development as a linear or cumulative process.</p> <p>But Rostow's view that a dynamic private sector was to be supported by a strong but market-friendly state can still be found in many of today's public-private partnership models. And anyone even slightly informed on World Bank and IMF policies over the past 20 years will see the persistence of his belief that political influence is best delivered under the radar of economic investments. In these and other ways, the Rostovian crab keeps clambering on, a full half century later.</p>",
  "<p>Hugo Ch\u00e1vez has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/08/hugo-chavez-wins-venezuelan-election\" title=\"\">won Venezuela's presidential elections</a>, defeating his conservative rival, Henrique Capriles by more than 9% of the vote and guaranteeing a third six-year term as head of the Opec member nation.

The immense support that Ch\u00e1vez still has after 13 years in power is rarely captured accurately by outside accounts of the country.</p> <p>I myself was reminded of this fact just before the elections, when I had the good fortune of sharing a few drinks with a Venezuelan film colleague in a Caracas night spot affectionately referred to by locals, somewhat disconcertingly, as Stab Alley. The district is Chavista turf, miles away from the upper class clubs that attract the city's well-to-do. It was no surprise to see the comandante on the bar's battered television.</p> <p>Our conversation predictably turned to politics. Between sips of Cacique rum, my friend and I went back and forth on a range of topics, I was playing devil's advocate in criticising the government for its paternalism and failure to truly change the country's oil rent economy; he was defending the administration on nearly all fronts.</p> <p>I continued to pigheadedly press my colleague until he starkly turned to me and stated in a rather grave and unsettling tone: \"I would not hesitate to sacrifice my life to defend this president. He's the only one who has done anything for the Venezuelan people.\"</p> <p>This statement, uttered from the mouth of a college-educated Venezuelan worker \u2013 the equivalent of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/16/uselections2008-johnmccain-barackobama-debate-joe-the-plumber\" title=\"\">\"Joe the plumber\" in the United States</a> \u2013 took me aback. Gringo that I am, I couldn't fathom taking up arms to defend any politician, ever. So as the discussion came to a relatively awkward end, I was left to contemplate how Ch\u00e1vez, after all these years, could still provoke such die-hard loyalty in his supporters.</p> <p>No one can deny the concrete benefits that many Venezuelans have received since the leader of the nation's \"Bolivarian revolution\" first came to power in 1999. His government has expanded education and healthcare while slashing poverty and writing one of the world's most progressive constitutions. The economy has been good, thanks to high oil prices, and despite the failure to effectively address the question of security and violent crime, the incumbent president can boast of some solid accomplishments.</p> <p>But there is something deeper that has eluded the gaze of outside pundits who for years have portrayed Ch\u00e1vez as either an autocratic dictator or a petrol-rich buffoon. What Ch\u00e1vez is, in fact, is Venezuelan: there is no more authentic a representative of the country's character than him. He is gregarious, loquacious, intensely nationalistic, contradictory, sometimes petulant, and he displays an uncanny, chameleon-like ability to be everything to everyone.</p> <p>Critics describe these traits as simple \"populism\", but Ch\u00e1vez has also done something that no political leader before him has done. Unapologetically, relentlessly, the leftist head of state has succeeded in projecting the image of an independent and sovereign Venezuela onto an international stage. In doing so, he has snapped the tradition of subservience that characterised the nation for decades. This vindication of \"Venezuelan-ness\" on a global scale has been one of his greatest triumphs for a population that has longed to be recognised as being \"just as good\" as northern nations.</p> <p>Of course, there is a strong opposition movement in the country, one that takes the US and Europe as its societal models and who view Ch\u00e1vez with as much repulsion as \"the monkeys who live in the slums\", as a Venezuelan engineer once confided to me. But while there is surely passion on the opposition side, I have yet to encounter the sort of devotion that I have in the Ch\u00e1vez camp. And I certainly have not met anyone who has confessed a willingness to take a bullet for Henrique Capriles.</p>",

  "<p>American companies and its government should avoid doing business with China's two leading technology firms, Huawei and ZTE, because they pose a national security threat to the US, the House of Representatives' intelligence committee will warn in a report to be published on Monday.</p> <p>The Republican-controlled panel also says US regulators should block mergers and acquisitions in the US by the two companies, which are among the world's leading suppliers of telecommunications gear and mobile phones.</p> <p>The panel's report will cause transatlantic friction over the role of the Chinese companies. In the UK, Huawei is a major supplier to the telecoms provider BT, and has supplied infrastructure being used in the new 4G superfast mobile network built by Everything Everywhere \u2013 the merged Orange/T-Mobile. Huawei provides access to its source code for GCHQ specialists who have reportedly examined it for threats and passed it as safe for use.</p> <p>Huawei is a private company founded by a former Chinese military engineer, and has grown rapidly to become the world's second largest supplier, behind Sweden's Ericsson, of telecommunications network gear, with operations in more than 140 countries. ZTE is the world's fourth largest mobile phone manufacturer, with 90,000 employees worldwide, and fifth-largest maker of telecoms equipment.</p> <p>While both companies' sales of mobile devices such as smartphones have grown in the US, espionage fears have proscribed any move into network infrastructure sales.</p> <p>ZTE has also enjoyed growth in its sale of mobile devices, although in recent months it has faced allegations about banned sales of US-sanctioned computer equipment to Iran. The FBI is probing reports that the company obstructed a US Commerce Department investigation into the sales.</p> <p>The intelligence panel says ZTE refused to provide any documents on its activities in Iran, but did provide a list of 19 individuals who serve on the Chinese communist party committee within the company. ZTE's citing of China's state secrecy laws for limiting information it could release only added to concern over Chinese government influence over its operations, the report says.</p> <p>Reflecting growing US governmental and commercial concern over cyber-attacks traced to China, the report also recommends that US government computer systems not include any components from the two firms because that could pose an espionage risk.</p> <p>\"China has the means, opportunity, and motive to use telecommunications companies for malicious purposes,\" the report says. It also raises the diplomatic temperature by warning that \"Huawei and ZTE have failed to assuage the committee's significant security concerns presented by their continued expansion into the US \u2026 In fact, given their obstructionist behaviour, the committee believes addressing these concerns have become an imperative for the country.\"</p> <p>But Huawei's US vice-president for external affairs, William Plummer, hit back: \"Baseless suggestions otherwise or purporting that Huawei is somehow uniquely vulnerable to cyber mischief ignore technical and commercial realities, recklessly threaten American jobs and innovation, do nothing to protect national security, and should be exposed as dangerous political distractions from legitimate public-private initiatives to address what are global and industry-wide cyber challenges,\" he said. Huawei is a \"globally trusted and respected company,\" he said, insisting that it had cooperated with investigators.</p> <p>ZTE said it \"profoundly disagrees\" with the committee's claims: \"ZTE should not be a focus of this investigation to the exclusion of the much larger western vendors,\" it commented in an open letter.</p> <p>The recommendations are the result of a year-long probe, including a congressional hearing last month in which senior Chinese executives of both companies testified, and denied posing a security threat. The most recent hearing, in September, was titled <a href=\"http://intelligence.house.gov/press-release/hpsci-hold-open-hearing-national-security-threats-posed-huawei-and-zte\" title=\"\">\"Open hearing on national security threats posted by Huawei and ZTE\"</a>.</p> <p>The bipartisan report is likely to become fodder for a presidential campaign in which the candidates have been competing over their readiness to clamp down on Chinese trade violations. The Republican candidate Mitt Romney, in particular, has made it a key point to get tougher on China by designating it a currency manipulator and fighting abuses such as intellectual property theft.</p> <p>The committee made the draft available to reporters and wire services in advance of public release on Monday, but only under the condition that they not publish stories until the broadcast Sunday of a CBS 60 Minutes report on Huawei. In the CBS report, the committee's chairman, Republican Rep Mike Rogers, urged American companies not to do business with Huawei.</p> <p>\"Find another vendor [than Huawei] if you care about your intellectual property; if you care about your consumers' privacy and you care about the national security of the United States of America,\" Rogers said in comments broadcast on the programme.</p> <p>The panel's recommendations are likely hamper Huawei and ZTE's ambitions to expand their business in the US. Their products are used in scores of countries, including in the west. Both deny being influenced by China's communist government.</p> <p>\"The investigation concludes that the risks associated with Huawei's and ZTE's provision of equipment to US critical infrastructure could undermine core US national-security interests,\" the report says.</p> <p>The report says the committee received information from industry experts and current and former Huawei employees suggesting that Huawei, in particular, may be violating US laws. It says that the committee will refer the allegations to the US government for further review and possible investigation. The report mentions allegations of immigration violations, bribery and corruption, and of a \"pattern and practice\" of Huawei using pirated software in its US facilities.</p> <p>An unclassified version of the report will be released at 15:00 BST, though a classified annex with \"significantly more information adding to the committee's concerns\" will remain redacted.</p> <p>Similar concerns have led <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/29/huawei-ban-cyber-cold-war\" title=\"\">the Australian government to ban Huawei</a> from bidding as a supplier to the A$38bn National Broadband Network (NBN). And in November 2011, the US online security company Symantec dissolved a joint venture in which it was the 49% minority partner with Huawei because it feared being shut out of US government business.</p> <p>However, \"Huawei has not and will not jeopardize our global commercial success nor the integrity of our customers' networks for any third party, government or otherwise,\" senior vice-president Charles Ding testified to the committee in September, suggesting it would be corporate suicide to do so.</p> <p>The report says the companies failed to provide responsive answers about their relationships and support by the Chinese government, and detailed information about their operations in the US. Huawei, in particular, is criticised for failing to provide thorough information, including on its corporate structure, history, financial arrangements and management.</p> <p>\"The committee finds that the companies failed to provide evidence that would satisfy any fair and full investigation. Although this alone does not prove wrongdoing, it factors into the committee's conclusions,\" it says.</p> <p>In Washington, Huawei executive Plummer said on Friday that the company co-operated in good faith with the investigation, which he said had not been objective and amounted to a \"political distraction\" from cybersecurity problems facing the entire industry.</p> <p>All major telecommunications firms, including those in the west, develop and manufacture equipment in China and overlapping supply chains require industry-wide solutions, he added. Singling out China-based firms wouldn't help.</p> <p>Plummer complained that the volume of information sought by the committee was unreasonable, and it had demanded some proprietary business information that \"no responsible company\" would provide.</p> <p>In justifying its scrutiny of the Chinese companies, the committee contended that Chinese intelligence services, as well as private companies and other entities, often recruit those with direct access to corporate networks to steal trade secrets and other sensitive proprietary data.</p> <p>It warned that malicious hardware or software implants in Chinese-manufactured telecommunications components and systems headed for US customers could allow Beijing to shut down or degrade critical national security systems in a time of crisis or war.</p> <p>The committee concluded that Huawei likely has substantially benefited from the support of the Chinese government.</p> <p>Huawei denies being financed to undertake research and development for the Chinese military, but the committee says it has received internal Huawei documentation from former employees showing the company provides special network services to an entity alleged to be an elite cyberwarfare unit within the People's Liberation Army.</p> <p>The intelligence committee recommended that the government's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, bar mergers and acquisitions by both Huawei and ZTE. CFIUS is a multi-agency regulatory panel chaired by treasury secretary Timothy Geithner, and screens foreign investment proposals for potential national security threats.</p> <p>Last year, Huawei had to unwind its purchase of a US computer company, 3Leaf Systems, after it failed to win CFIUS approval. However, Huawei employs 1,700 people in the US, and business is expanding. US revenues rose to $1.3bn in 2011, up from $765m in 2010.</p>",
  "<p>An opposition victory, said Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, was as likely as snow in Maracaibo, a furnace of a city in western Venezuela. When hail subsequently fell on the city last month \u2013 reportedly the first in half a century \u2013 his opponents took heart. It was not snow, but maybe icy rain would suffice?</p> <p>It did not. Venezuela's president has vanquished his challenger and enraptured supporters to win a fourth term, extending his 14-year rule, health permitting, until 2019.</p> <p>Most opinion polls had given the 58-year-old a wide lead but a few showed him trailing, suggesting his cancer and the country's economic and social problems might end voters' faith in his revolution.</p> <p>Instead his electoral \"red machine\", a formidable combination of petro-state power and grassroots activism, mobilised the chavista base and floating voters to renew the mandate for \"21st-century socialism\" and the \"Bolivarian process\".</p> <p>His illness, along with Venezuela's high crime rate and crumbling infrastructure, risked swinging history's pendulum against him. But the victory showed enduring charisma and political mastery. A question mark, however, hovers over how long he will live to rule. Ch\u00e1vez claims to be cured but some palace insiders say the cancer is terminal.</p> <p>As results were announced some opponents cried foul, saying the president had abused state resources and illegally tilted the playing field against <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/03/henrique-capriles-topple-hugo-chavez\" title=\"\">Henrique Capriles, 40, a state governor who had barnstormed the country, whipping up ecstatic support</a>.</p> <p>It was a familiar lament but Ch\u00e1vez, a shrewd strategist behind the clownish stunts, has for 14 years made a consistent, triumphant assertion: \"<em>Somos la mayor\u00eda</em>.\" We are the majority.</p> <p>It is the pillar of legitimacy that props up his socialist experiment and protects it from critics at home and abroad who claim Venezuela is veering towards autocracy and tyranny.</p> <p>After each election landslide, Ch\u00e1vez has emerged on to the \"people's balcony\" in Miraflores, the presidential palace in downtown Caracas, to savour acclaim from the crowds below.</p> <p>It has been an extraordinary journey dating back to 1982. Ch\u00e1vez, a poor boy from the plains who adored folk tales and stories of Simon Bol\u00edvar, the 19th-century liberator, was a young army officer with a dream: revolt.</p> <p>Petrodollars and peaceful alternations of power between two parties had made this corner of South America a supposedly prosperous democracy but beneath the sheen festered oil dependence, corruption, poverty and social exclusion.</p> <p>The then Lieutenant Hugo Ch\u00e1vez recruited fellow officers into a conspiracy to overthrow the establishment and usher in a new, better democracy. After a decade of plotting, in February 1992, they attempted a coup. It was a military fiasco, letting the unpopular president, Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez, survive, but Ch\u00e1vez, by now a lieutenant colonel, turned his televised surrender address into a political triumph. Eloquent and dashing in his red beret, he introduced himself to a startled nation \u2013 \"listen to Comandante Ch\u00e1vez\" \u2013 and said his objectives had not been met \"<em>por ahora</em>\" (for now). He deserved 30 years in jail, went the joke: one for the coup, 29 for failing.</p> <p>Pardoned and released after two years, he was adopted as a figurehead by a coalition of grassroots movements and small leftwing parties and stormed to victory in the 1998 election, cheered not only by the poor but a middle class fed up with an ossified establishment. With a barrel of oil just $8, the petro-state was near broke.</p> <p>Few outside Venezuela, until then best known for beauty queens and oil, knew what to make of this mercurial figure who praised Fidel Castro and promised revolution but said he was neither left nor right but seeker of a Blairesque \"third way\".</p> <p>It was often forgotten later but Ch\u00e1vez's early economic policies were moderate, in some ways even conservative. He retained the previous government's finance minister, toyed with privatising telecommunications and spoke of fiscal rectitude.</p> <p>Politically, however, he steamed ahead with a referendum and elections for a new constitution and system of government. It was in many ways progressive and addressed social exclusion but also greatly enhanced executive powers and permitted two consecutive terms.</p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez's vehement rhetoric against the wealthy as \"squealing pigs\" and \"vampires\" who looted the oil wealth endeared him to the barrios but alienated the middle class and traditional elites. The country divided into a third who adored Ch\u00e1vez, a third who despised him and a third who floated in the middle.</p> <p>Opponents called him a monkey and worse. In April 2002 the elites <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/apr/12/venezuela\" title=\"\">briefly ousted him in a Bush-administration-backed coup</a>, tried again with an oil strike, then a recall referendum, dramas which stained the opposition and burnished Ch\u00e1vez's legend.</p> <p>Even so he would have lost the 2004 referendum, he admitted, were it not for the recovery in oil prices and help from Castro who sent thousands of Cuban doctors, nurses and teachers to staff social programmes in the slums known as <em>misiones</em> (missions). They multiplied and consummated Ch\u00e1vez's bond with the poor. Poverty decreased, health indicators improved and thousands got jobs in the expanding state sector. The moribund opposition boycotted the 2005 national assembly election.</p> <p>Emboldened, the president became more radical, declared himself a socialist and started nationalising \"strategic industries\" and expropriating millions of hectares of \"unproductive\" land. He stormed to a second term in 2006 with 63% of the vote. He declined to take part in a debate with his challenger, a gruff, opposition governor named Manuel Rosales, on the grounds that \"an eagle does not hunt flies\".</p> <p>It was his apogee: the economy roaring, the people on-side, globally feted for condemning the US invasion of Iraq. He called George W Bush a donkey, Mr Danger, an asshole and, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/sep/21/usa.venezuela\" title=\"\">during a memorable UN speech, the devil</a>. Supporters such as the former London mayor, Ken Livingstone, the actors Sean Penn and Danny Glover and the polymath Noam Chomsky paid homage in Caracas. The president dominated airwaves, commandeering radio and television for folksy, freewheeling speeches which lasted hours.</p> <p>But problems began to mount. Pulling the plug on RCTV, an opposition TV station which had backed the 2002 coup, triggered student protests which climaxed with Ch\u00e1vez <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/dec/03/venezuela.usa\" title=\"\">losing a 2007 referendum to abolish political term limits</a>.</p> <p>The web of currency and price controls and harassment of the private sector produced inflation and sporadic shortages. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/10/venezuela-caracas-gang-warfare-murder\" title=\"\">Violent crime spiralled</a>. The opposition revived and made inroads in 2008 regional elections, wresting back Caracas and even slums such as Petare, previously chavista bastions.</p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez tightened control over his own movement, as well as the armed forces and judiciary, and won a second attempt to abolish term limits in a 2009 referendum. Some opponents were jailed, purportedly for corruption, and others fled to exile. Ch\u00e1vez spoke of ruling until 2030, an ambition echoed by a growing state media empire which promoted a personality cult.</p> <p>Rolling power cuts and crumbling infrastructure cost his PSUV party the popular vote in 2010 national assembly elections \u2013 \"we are the majority\", crowed the opposition \u2013 but gerrymandering gave it most seats.</p> <p>Few doubted Ch\u00e1vez would win a third term \u2013 a third of the population still revered him and petrodollars and institutional control would woo the <em>ninis</em> \u2013 until last year when he was struck down by cancer, a disaster for a system of government and political campaigning built around his personal energy and charisma.</p> <p>While Capriles campaigned vigorously, Ch\u00e1vez remained largely confined to the palace and a few, relatively fleeting public appearances. But petrodollars funded an emergency house-building programme and a reboot of decaying missions, a fiscal splurge which boosted economic growth to 5%. Ch\u00e1vez also warned of civil war if he lost, casting himself as the unlikely friend of the wealthy because he represented stability.</p> <p>Even with the chief partially incapacitated, and some rallies cancelled or poorly attended, the formidable electoral \"red machine\" cranked into high gear. Billboards, posters and murals sprouted across the country. Ch\u00e1vez dominated television, if not always in person then through surrogates. His voice filled the radio dial. Civil servants were bussed to events in huge convoys, a mobile army. Workers from the <em>misiones</em> roved the barrios handing out campaign leaflets and signing up people to expanded social programmes. A frenetic house-building programme gave thousands of families new homes and put hundreds of thousands more on a waiting list, saying they would be housed after the election if Ch\u00e1vez won.</p> <p>Patronage may have helped turn out the vote, but Ch\u00e1vez could also count on a powerful affinity with Venezuela's poor, said Michael Shifter, president of the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue thinktank.</p> <p>\"Despite his illness, I still think he retains a large emotional connection with a lot of Venezuelans that I think were not prepared to vote against him,\" he told the Associated Press.</p> <p>State media depicted Capriles as an agent of the oligarchy and US imperialism who would introduce savage neoliberal austerity. Chavista activists disrupted his events \u2013 blocking motorways, throwing bottles and, in one case, shooting dead three people. The consulate in Miami was closed, disenfranchising much of the pro-Capriles diaspora.</p> <p>Even cancer, in some ways, helped Ch\u00e1vez's campaign. After disappearing from view for treatment, stoking mystery and alarm, he would reappear, Lazarus-like, and proclaim triumphant resurrection. Speculation about his health and squabbling between rival courtiers \u2013 there is no obvious successor to keep the movement's factions together should he die \u2013 could roil his fourth term. All that matters for now is that the campaign successfully brushed over the issue.</p> <p>Opponents complained about dirty tricks and abuse of state resources but to supporters the comandante's victory proved yet again the veracity of his venerable campaign slogan: \"<em>Ch\u00e1vez es el pueblo</em>\". Ch\u00e1vez is the people.</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney will call for an escalation of the conflict in Syria by arming rebels with the heavy weapons needed to confront president Bashar al-Assad's tanks, helicopters and fighter jets.</p> <p>Romney is to make the proposal on Monday in what his campaign team has billed as a major foreign policy speech in Lexington, Virginia.</p> <p>In extracts published in advance, he opened up the prospect, if he becomes president, of a US-Iranian proxy war being fought in Syria. </p> <p>\"Iran is sending arms to Assad because they know his downfall would be a strategic defeat for them. We should be working no less vigorously with our international partners to support the many Syrians who would deliver that defeat to Iran \u2013 rather than sitting on the sidelines,\" he said. </p> <p>The proposal would mark a significant shift from Barack Obama's administration's policy of trying to keep the conflict a low-intensity one amid fears it might turn into a regional war. Obama is putting pressure on Saudi Arabia and Qatar, the main backers of the rebels, to restrict the supply of weapons to small arms.</p> <p>The Republican presidential candidate has made several attempts at establishing his credentials to be commander-in-chief but those speeches made little impact. Against the background of his win over Obama in last week's debate, the Romney campaign team is hoping this speech will be better received.</p> <p>The speech is aimed at countering critics who say he has not had much to say so far about foreign policy and given little indication of the lines he would pursue as president. </p> <p>He has a large team of foreign policy advisers \u2013 more than 30 \u2013 a mixture of realists and neo-conservatives. The aggressive language in the extracts of his speech released indicate he is leaning towards the neo-conservatives. </p> <p>Romney's comments that will have the most bearing on the election campaign are his return to criticism of the Obama adminstration over its handling of the killings of the US ambassador, Chris Stevens, and three other Americans at the consultate in Benghazi, Libya.</p> <p>\"The attack on our consulate in Benghazi on September 11th, 2012 was likely the work of the same forces that attacked our homeland on September 11th, 2001. This latest assault cannot be blamed on a reprehensible video insulting Islam, despite the administration's attempts to convince us of that for so long,\" Romney said.</p> <p>\"No, as the administration has finally conceded, these attacks were the deliberate work of terrorists who use violence to impose their dark ideology on others, especially women and girls; who are fighting to control much of the Middle East today; and who seek to wage perpetual war on the west.\"</p> <p>Romney, after mishandling his initial response to the killings, is seeking to tap into widespread resentment and anger in the US, especially among conservatives, at what they regard as lack of gratitude among Libyans for American help during the Arab spring.</p> <p>He accused Obama of failing to provide unequivocal support for the rebels in Syria. \"I will work with our partners to identify and organise those members of the opposition who share our values and ensure they obtain the arms they need to defeat Assad's tanks, helicopters, and fighter jets.\"</p> <p>He anticipated that the rebels will one day lead the country and the US should align itself with them, given the country's position at the heart of the Middle East.</p> <p>He said he and Obama share a desire for a safer, freer and more prosperous Middle East. </p> <p>\"I share this hope. But hope is not a strategy. We cannot support our friends and defeat our enemies in the Middle East when our words are not backed up by deeds,\" he said.</p> <p>He warned Iran not to pursue a nuclear weapon capability and said the US had to back this up \"through actions, not just words\", and urged an expansion of the aircraft carrier presence in the eastern Mediterranean and the Gulf.</p> <p>On Afghanistan, over which Romney faced a lot of criticism for failing to mention during his Republican convention speech, he said he would not be tied to the deadline set by Obama for withdrawal by the end of 2014 and hinted he might delay it.</p> <p>\"The route to more war \u2013 and to potential attacks here at home \u2013 is a politically timed retreat that abandons the Afghan people to the same extremists who ravaged their country and used it to launch the attacks of 9/11,\" he said.</p> <p>He expressed support for the US-proclaimed objective of creation of a Palestinian state.</p>",

Some votes were still to be counted, but the council said the result was not in doubt.</p> <p>Pumping his fist in the air, Ch\u00e1vez address his supporters from the balcony of the presidential palace as a barrage of fireworks lit up the sky. \"The revolution has triumphed!\" Ch\u00e1vez told the crowd, saying his supporters \"voted for socialism.\"</p> <p>\"Today we've shown that Venezuela's democracy is one of the best democracies in the world, and we will continue to show it,\" he shouted, waving a replica of S\u00edmon Bolivar sword. </p> <p>As the result was announced, his supporters burst into cheers and songs of \"Viva La Patria\" and \"Ooh Aah, Ch\u00e1vez won't go.\"</p> <p>\"I'm crying with joy,\" said Alirio Guevara, a fisherman from Vargas, who came to Caracas to vote and joined the joyous crowds at the Ch\u00e1vez campaign headquarters. \"In the next six years, we will deepen the revolution.\"</p> <p>In accepting defeat, Capriles took solace in picking up more votes than any previous challenger and restricting Ch\u00e1vez to a single-digit margin of victory. </p> <p>\"In order to win, one must know how to lose. For me the people's voices are sacred. For those who feel sad, I tell them, 'we started to build a road and there it is'. We have 6 million people who want a new road.\"</p> <p>Underlining the intense interest in the campaign, the turnout among the 19 million registered voters was a record 80.4%.</p> <p>Many analysts had warned that a slim margin of victory could lead to violence, but with an almost double-digit gap there was no immediate indication of unrest on Sunday evening.</p> <p>Venezuelans had queued under the sun for up to five hours to cast their vote amid expectations of a possible change, prompted by vastly contrasting opinion surveys in the weeks before the poll. </p> <p>After the result was announced, Ch\u00e1vez tweeted: \"Thank you, my God. Thanks to everyone. Thanks my beloved people!!! Viva Venezuela!!!! Viva Bolivar!!!!!\"</p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez has held on to power for more than a decade despite an attempted coup, a nationwide oil strike and a yearlong fight with cancer, which may not be over. </p> <p>With many voters unhappy at one of the world's highest murder rates and crumbling infrastructure, his party had lost ground in recent legislative elections and his long illness had clearly restricted his campaign appearances, particularly in contrast to his 40-year-old rival who was making two stops a day in a energetic campaign that criss-crossed the country.</p> <p>The opposition had felt this was their best chance to regain power, but the president ended strongly with a giant rally of hundreds of thousands of supporters in Caracas on the final day of the campaign on Thursday.</p> <p>On the campaign trail, president Ch\u00e1vez vowed that if re-elected he would use the next six years to correct past mistakes, to continue to build a socialist alternative to the capitalist model, and to continue using the country's vast oil revenues to redistribute wealth, promote the revolution overseas and to bolster ideological allies such as Cuba and Nicaragua.</p> <p>But analysts say his reduced margin of victory \u2013 down from 26% in 2006 and 16% in 1998 \u2013 may prompt changes in the cabinet and the government's policy, particularly with regard to public security and the economy. Health concerns are also likely to linger.</p>",
