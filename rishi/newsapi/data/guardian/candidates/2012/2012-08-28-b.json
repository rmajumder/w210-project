  "<p>Unhappy Republican delegates have staged a rare revolt at the party's national convention in Tampa, noisily protesting against rules changes they claim crack down on grassroots supporters.</p> <p>The protesters accused the party leadership of steamrolling the changes through. They shouted \"object\", \"point of order\", \"division\", \"liberty\" and \"USA\" as John Boehner, the House speaker, pressed ahead, ignoring them.</p> <p>Boehner claimed the rules had been passed by a voice vote in spite of the protests.</p> <p>The revolt was staged by delegates mainly from Texas and Maine, some of them supporters of the libertarian Ron Paul.</p> <p>One of the protesters, Phillip Payne, 33, owner of a land-surveying company and member of the Texas delegation, said: \"This is a power grab.\" </p> <p>Wearing a cowboy hat like his fellow Texan delegates, he blamed the party leadership in general rather than the presidential candidate Mitt Romney. \"It is a about principle. It is not about Paul. It is a liberty issue,\" Payne said.</p> <p>\"This is going to disenfranchise a lot of enthusiastic grassroots people such as the Tea Party activists,\" he added.</p> <p>It is rare at modern conventions to have such revolts, given how carefully orchestrated they have become. They are especially rare for Republicans, who are usually highly disciplined.</p> <p>The protest reflects to some extent the split in the Republican Party between the old establishment and the relatively new Tea Party activists and the libertarians gathered round Paul.</p> <p>In a further sign of the continuing trouble Paul and his supporters pose for Romney and the Republican leadership, the delegations from Minnesota, Nevada and Iowa announced on the convention floor that they were voting for the Texas congressman, even though he failed to win those or any other states during the primary and caucus process.</p> <p>This was possible because Paul's extensive grassroots network was able to dominate congressional district and state conventions in these states and elsewhere. </p> <p>It is this sort of under-the-radar delegate strategy that the Republican leadership wanted to stop by changing the party's rules, to the fury of some delegates. </p> <p>They objected to a change to Rule 12 that would allow Republican leaders to make changes to party rules between conventions. Until now, changes could usually only be made at conventions. </p> <p>The other objection was to Rule 16 that would require states to allocate delegates according to the statewide vote rather than a winner-take-all approach. This is aimed at states such as Maine where Paul supporters are accused of taking over the nominating process, allocating 20 of the 24 delegates to Paul.</p> <p>As part of the revolt, protesters attempted to gather the 29 signatures needed from members of the party rules committee. This would have allowed minority reports objecting to the rules changes to be heard on the floor. But the protesters failed to secure the necessary signatures.</p> <p>One of the minority reports objecting to the changes came from the Texas delegation.</p> <p>Melinda Fredericks, 52, is a member of the Texas delegation but also a member of the rules committee. She had supported the Texas minority report.</p> <p>She expressed sorrow that the changes had gone through. \"I am not happy about it,\" she said. \"I have conflicting feelings.\" She was disappointed there had not been enough notice to allow time to discuss it with her delegation.</p> <p>She added, however, that the Texas delegation had secured some concessions. The leadership power to make changes between conventions would only apply up until 2014 and not the next convention in 2016.</p> <p>But the Texans were not united in protest. Some resented the public display of protest. Jan Koehne, 71, a rancher and gun seller, said some of the protesters were not active members of the party, rarely taking part in the state conventions, and did not understand that decisions were reached gradually.</p>",
  "<p>Spain's attempts to stave off a full bailout were dealt a blow on Tuesday when the regional government of Catalonia said it needed \u20ac5bn (\u00a33.97bn) from a central government rescue fund.</p> <p>It came as figures showed Spanish banks saw \u20ac1 withdrawn for every \u20ac20 deposited in July \u2013 making it the worst month for deposit flight in 15 years \u2013 and Spain's statistics institute revealed the recession was worse than thought, with the economy shrinking at an annual rate of 1.3% in the second quarter.</p> <p>Catalonia is one of half a dozen regional governments shut out of markets and needing government help to roll over debt and fund budget deficits. Regions have a combined debt of \u20ac145bn, with \u20ac36bn needing to be refinanced this year.</p> <p>Prime minister Mariano Rajoy's conservative government may eventually take direct control of the region's finances. But regional prime minister Artur Mas, of the Catalan nationalist Convergence and Union coalition, has threatened a snap election if that happens. His spokesman, Francesc Homs, rejected any \"political terms\" for borrowing the money.</p> <p>A report by the Fedea thinktank predicts Catalonia, which accounts for one fifth of the economy, will miss the 1.5% deficit target set this year, with an expected 2.5% deficit making it the second-worst performing region. Revised figures showed the Spanish recession started three months earlier than previously indicated. \"The data shows the recession started in the third quarter of last year,\" secretary of state for the economy, Fernando Jim\u00e9nez, admitted.</p> <p>\"The downturn in the Spanish economy is deeper than previously thought and accelerating,\" warned Robert O'Daly of the Economist Intelligence Unit.</p> <p>Unemployment is already at 25% but the speed at which jobs are disappearing quickened to an average rate of 800,000 jobs a year in the second quarter, according to the statistics institute.</p> <p>European council president Herman Van Rompuy said on Tuesday it was up to Spain to decide whether to seek eurozone help, after meeting Rajoy in Madrid. Rajoy repeated that he needed more details from the European Central Bank to help him decide.</p> <p>Sources at the Bank of Spain claimed the sudden drop in deposits was mostly due to banks withdrawing money placed with other entities, but the fall came amid growing consumer anger with retail banks. Tens of thousands of small savers are set to be hit with losses on preference shares they bought in former savings banks that now need bailing out by the eurozone's rescue fund.</p> <p>Spanish banks can take up to \u20ac100bn (\u00a379.7bn) from the fund, but preference shareholders must first bear losses of up to 80%. Many savers who bought the shares thought they were risk-free deposits from high street banks.</p> <p>Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank, abruptly withdrew from delivering a speech in the US next weekend, citing pressure of work as he prepares two important moves on the euro crisis.</p> <p>Draghi was due to speak at the annual economic policymaking elite gathering at Jackson Hole in Wyoming on Saturday before an audience of global central bankers. But he is preparing to unveil controversial moves next week aimed at pushing down the costs of borrowing for Spain and Italy by launching ECB bond-buying interventions in the financial markets, a policy bitterly criticised by Germany's powerful Bundesbank.</p> <p>Draghi is also engaged in behind-the-scenes politicking over the shape and powers of a new eurozone bank supervision authority. A few days after Draghi announces the bond-buying policy, following an ECB governing council meeting next week, the European commission is to deliver proposals for the new eurozone bank regulator, calling for the ECB to be given extensive new powers as the key supervisory authority.</p> <p>J\u00f6rg Asmussen, the German member of the ECB's six-strong executive who has co-drafted the bond-buying scheme for Draghi, disclosed on Monday some of the conditions required to trigger ECB action.</p> <p>The ECB will intervene in the secondary markets to buy bonds with short maturities, he said, but only if the eurozone's bailout funds first became active in the primary markets \u2013 in other words directly buying up distressed government bonds.</p> <p>That introduces a strong element of politics and likely delays since eurozone governments and finance ministers will need to decide to use the bailout funds before ECB action is triggered.</p> <p>Any country benefiting from the bond-buying would need to request a bailout and succumb to eurozone terms, situations that Rajoy and his Italian counterpart, Mario Monti, are anxious to avoid.</p> <p>Asmussen also made clear the ECB was keen to be granted the new banking supervisory powers, but warned the commission in Brussels it would only take on the role on its terms.</p> <p>\"The ECB is ready to accept this responsibility, but under certain conditions,\" he said. \"The ECB has to be given all the instruments needed to carry out the tasks of bank supervision effectively. In particular, that means access to all the necessary information, intervention rights and the right to close down non-viable banks.</p> <p>\"Without these minimum tools, the ECB will not take on the responsibility. The risk to the reputation of the institution would be too &#xa0;great.\"</p>",
  "<p>Unless you're from there, you probably cannot name the mayor of Tulsa, Oklahoma, or of Lexington, Kentucky, or of Anchorage, Alaska. But you probably know the mayor of Newark, New Jersey \u2013 a city smaller than all of these, and once known only for the novels of Philip Roth and an airport. And if you don't, trust me: you soon will.</p> <p>Perma-smiling, bald-pated Cory Booker may only govern the 67th most populous city in America, but he is everywhere. This June, he gave the <a href=\"http://news.stanford.edu/news/2012/june/transcript-cory-booker-061912.html\">commencement speech at Stanford</a>, California, invoking Mother Teresa and lamenting that \"we are a nation that has become so polarized,\" incapable of coming together in some pure land beyond ideology. On Twitter, he is an unstoppable self-promoter, and a million-plus followers (four times more people than actually live in Newark) gorge on retweeted hosannas from his admirers and mysterious platitudes such as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CoryBooker/status/238135770882400257\">\"Be Hope\"</a> or \"If u fear it, u give it power.\" Oprah herself flew into to Newark to discuss his recent made-for-TV dash into a burning building \u2013 and to quiz him on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OR3Zi0eBcvo\">why he's still single</a>.</p> <p>This week, Booker has to cool his heels while another New Jersey politician has the spotlight: Chris Christie, the governor, delivers the keynote address at the GOP convention on Tuesday night. But the big man's star is falling fast, and Booker knows it. New Jersey has one of the highest unemployment rates in America \u2013 at 9.8%, it's not only well above New York and Connecticut, but even worse than woeful Michigan. After nearly three years in office, Christie's only major legacy is the cancellation of the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/13/opinion/gov-chris-christie-and-the-tunnel-project.html\">nation's largest public transportation project</a>, the decades-long effort to build a new rail tunnel to Manhattan, which allowed him to pose as a \"principled\" budget-cutter \u2013 while commuters languish in underpasses more than a century old.</p> <p>And Christie's once amusing surliness is beginning to look more like pointless belligerence. Remember the Navy Seal whom he called an \"idiot\" and <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0312/73897.html\">cautioned</a> that \"your rear-end's gonna get thrown in jail\"? Or the press conference where <a href=\"http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/national_world&amp;id=8721053\">he snapped</a> \"Are you stupid?\" at a reporter \u2013 also an \"idiot\", apparently \u2013 who dared to ask whether the governor would address the state legislature? And we shouldn't forget last month's <a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2012/07/06/chris-christie-governor-jersey-shore-video-boardwalk-fight/\">Jersey Shore showdown</a>, when he bellowed insults at a passer-by while clutching an ice cream cone. It's taking a toll: asked to describe their governor, <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/07/gov_christie_no_less_popular_t.html\">New Jerseyans mostly answer</a> \"bully\" and \"arrogant\".</p> <p>I'm not sure how seriously we should take the splash in Monday's New York Post that Mitt Romney <a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/christie_had_veeping_doubts_b1gkN5io8CtDgcuiuEgMqL\">asked Christie to join the Republican ticket</a>, and Christie refused to board what he (correctly) perceived to be a sinking ship. But if he thinks that the 2012 presidential election isn't going to end well, just wait until next year. Christie may not yet be done for \u2013 but the cult of Cory smells blood, and multiple sources have reported that Booker has been meeting with state party bosses to prepare for a gubernatorial run next year. Barack Obama's team, which has little affection for Booker after the Newark mayor criticised the presidential campaign's messaging about Romney and Bain Capital, are putting him in prime time next week all the same. </p> <p>Booker has never made a secret of his hunger for power beyond Newark, but until now, most in New Jersey thought he'd wait until 2014, when Frank Lautenberg, the oldest man in the Senate, at last steps down. But that was then. Now, it looks as if Christie could be toppled, and while Booker does care about the city of Newark, he's not staying there a day longer than he needs to.</p> <p>And after that, who knows? Oprah does, I suspect. To her question about presidential ambition, Booker gave a characteristically inconclusive response:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"It's not something I can visualize right now.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>He might not yet be a shoo-in for the governor's mansion, and whatever he wants after that, but remember: Cory Booker is not his own man. There is a reason why the mayors of Tulsa and Anchorage will not be on prime-time television this convention season, and it has nothing to do with Booker's toothy grin. Booker is a young man in a hurry, and to get out of Newark, he had made all the right friends. Mark Zuckerberg, famously, threw Booker $100m for Newark schools after the mayor seduced the boy wonder at a dinner in Sun Valley. (Zuckerberg announced the gift, with both Booker and Christie beside him, on \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Mark-Zuckerbergs-Big-Announcement-Video\">where else?</a> \u2013 the Oprah Winfrey show.) Steven Spielberg loves Booker; Barbra Streisand helped bankroll his last campaign. </p> <p>And if you're a politician in the New York metropolitan area, Hollywood and Silicon Valley are afterthoughts when you can just go where the money is: right downtown to Wall Street. (Though thanks to Christie, the drive there from Newark could take you a whole hour.) Do you really think that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/21/us/politics/cory-a-booker-criticizes-obamas-bain-ad.html\">Booker lashed out</a> at the Obama campaign's successful demonization of Romney's Bain Capital career \u2013 which he <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsdD3AvSgVQ\">tried to roll back</a> hours later with obvious condescension \u2013 because it wasn't courtly enough for the gentlemanly sport of presidential campaigning? For that matter, do you think that he <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/16/nyregion/police-evict-occupy-newark-protesters.html\">evicted Occupy Newark</a> out of concern for the grass? Of course not. Nobody who has spent this long to climb this high goes on Meet the Press without a game plan.</p> <p>No, by stepping out in defense of high finance, and then by making it clear that his reversal was only on orders from Chicago, Booker has put himself in the catbird seat for 2013 and onward. If, as seems likely, Obama wins a second term, then the temptation will be strong among the area's bankers and private equity titans to back the hard-driving Christie for a second term as governor. (Jersey City hosts the back offices of many Wall Street firms, and during Christie's lobbyist days, he <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/05/nyregion/05corzine.html\">succeeded in getting securities fraud exempted</a> from New Jersey's consumer fraud act.)</p> <p>But Booker, darling Booker, will have a case to make. Wall Street will not have to choose between an unsuccessful governor and a populist insurgent, because Booker is safely one of them.</p> <p>When Booker wails about polarization and pulls out the come-together pabulum, he's clearly channeling a previous black state politician suddenly thrust on the national stage. And the parallels are there: like the young Obama, Booker has the charm, the brain, and the fundraising ability to go very, very far. But the president, as <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/08/27/120827fa_fact_mayer\">Jane Mayer exhaustively documented in last week's New Yorker</a>, has always found it tiresome to suck up to money, and has actually got worse at it over time. The money was always a means to an end.</p> <p>Whereas Booker really does believe that rich guys know best \u2013 and whether he ends up in Newark, in Trenton, or in Washington, his supposedly post-ideological politics are really just a way to maintain the status quo and reduce government to a billionaire- and corporate-funded charity. Which, to be frank, explains why the world of finance loves him. It may briefly feel nice to donate to charity. But the real reason you do it is for the tax break.</p>",

  "<p>Ron Paul and his fervent supporters, both inside and outside the Republican Party's convention hall in Tampa, remained a thorn in the side of Mitt Romney on Tuesday.</p> <p>The libertarian Texas congressman lost the nomination race to Romney and is now retiring from politics. But his presence in Tampa has provided a distraction from the seamless show of party unity desired by Republican planners, even though a dispute between his supporters and Romney campaign officials over party rules had been settled.</p> <p>When Paul entered the convention centre ahead of the official start of the convention on Tuesday, his backers among the delegates cheered and chanted his name, drowning out some competing chants for Romney.</p> <p>Some of his supporters said they would disrupt proceedings later on Tuesday, ahead of the roll-call that will formally nominate Romney as the Republican presidential candidate.</p> <p>The Paul supporters are still angry over changes to the party rules that have stripped some delegates of their voting rights.</p> <p>David Boyera Paul supporter from Falmouth, Maine, said of the 24 delegates from that state, 20 are Paul supporters. As part of backroom negotiations, that number has been cut to ten. \"They do not want a convention. They want a coronation,\" said Boyer 23. He added he is not disputing that Romney is the nominee and is not challenging that but he is concerned only about protecting grassroots power.</p> <p>He said that would mount a challenge ahead of the roll-call by asking to take the microphone. If he fails and is denied a chance to have his say, he will be followed by other delegates, all other nine remaining Paul supporters, each going up in turn. He said other delegations, including Texas and Massachusetts, are sympathetic and will also support them.</p> <p>Among the Maine delegates stripped of their voting rights is Cody Morgan, 19. Both Boyer and Morgan said the last-minute decision by a committee made up of nine members of the Republican establishment was unfair. The delegates had paid for air fares and hotels only to find they would not be able to vote, relegated to the status of guests, they said.</p> <p>Meanwhile outside on the streets of Tampa hundreds of Paul supporters \u2013 who embrace his mix of extreme right-wing hostility to government with more liberal views on foreign policy and social issues \u2013 demonstrated on street corners.</p> <p>A group of about 50 held up Ron Paul placards and signs by the main road going into the convention centre where Romney will be nominated this week. Though most of them identified as Republicans, they had little good to say about Romney and were full of praise for Paul.</p> <p>\"What he says is so real. He speaks about the issues that effect real people. He is the only one who understands economics,\" said Darrell Young from Georgia.</p> <p>Elsewhere Paul supporters walked the streets holding old Paul campaign signs or stood on street corners hailing traffic. They got a few horn beeps in return, including from several cars painted in Ron Paul slogans and portraits.</p> <p>Devon Spencer and Victor Escobar had driven three days from California just to be in Tampa and had attended the mass Paul rallies over the weekend. Like many Paul supporters they had nothing good to say about Romney and had no plans to vote for him.</p> <p>\"Romney and Obama are the same. They are financed by the same people,\" Spencer said.</p> <p>Some of those views can even be found inside the massed ranks of delegates who will nominate Romney. Despite not winning a single state by popular vote, Paul's campaign began a \"delegate strategy\" exploiting party rules and their activists' enthusiasm to gain far more delegates than the share of the vote Paul won during the nomination contest.</p> <p>However, challenges by Romney-supporting legal teams and state officials has seen many of those delegates shorn away \u2013 but not all. Evan Kenney is a Ron Paul supporter from Romney's home state of Massachusetts who first won his delegate slot, then saw it taken away and then had it reinstated.</p> <p>Though he is committed to vote for Romney's nomination, he said he was<br>doing his bit to put forward dissenting views by talking about libertarian-style issues.</p> <p>Nor would he commit to voting for Romney in November, saying he would do so only if Romney adopted some Paul-sounding policies in bringing troops home and monetary policy. \"I hope I can vote for Romney,\" Kenney said.</p> <p>The idea that even within the convention hall there are outspoken delegates critical of Romney is anathema to the way modern political conventions are meant to unfold.</p> <p>They are expected to be PR-driven efforts aimed at showing party unity and introducing Romney to a wider audience.</p> <p>Yet the Ron Paul delegates, though so small in number they can do little to upset the actual process, have been able to inject some level of dissent that party bosses have been frustrated by.</p> <p>One supporter, Bobby Regi from Denver, was patiently waiting in line to get inside the convention holding a \"Ron Paul for president\" sign and even clung to the far-fetched hope Paul might still be nominated in Tampa. \"I think Ron Paul could still be president,\" Regi explained.</p> <p>That might explain the recent bid by Republican National Committee officials and other party leaders to change the rules for the 2016 race. New regulations had been drawn up that would have allowed a nominee to veto delegates sent to the convention.</p> <p>The move was seen as a power grab by the national party against state party officials and would have made insurgent campaigns like Paul far less likely in practise.</p> <p>However, several groups of party activists, ranging from RNC lawyers to Paul supporters to outraged state parties, opposed the change and threatened a potentially embarrassing vote over the party rules on the convention floor.</p> <p>However, the Houston Chronicle reported that the new rules had been changed in the face of the opposition, especially from the large and powerful Texas delegation. The compromise deal now allows delegates to selected by local state rules and organisations but voids them if they vote for someone other than the nominee.</p> <p>But other activists have warned they are still not satisfied. The conservative grassroots FreedomWorks group had emailed its supporters on Tuesday to urge them to still call delegates on the RNC Rules Committee and tell them to \"stop the RNC powergrab\".</p> <p>The dispute also brought in Tea Party favourite Sarah Palin who on Monday night had posted about the issue on her Facebook page and called the changes a \"direct attack\" on ordinary Republican conservatives by elite party officials.</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney's campaign team has downplayed the Republican presidential challenger's chances of achieving a vital poll bounce from the party's convention, blaming the havoc caused by hurricane Isaac.</p> <p>As Romney flew into Tampa, Florida, two days early in an attempt to kickstart the sputtering convention into life, his senior campaign strategist Stuart Stevens moved to lower expectations that the event would lead to a poll boost. \"All bets are off,\" he told reporters on the plane from Boston.</p> <p>Only two weeks ago, Romney officials had confidently predicted a poll bounce of at least 5% and possibly as high as 11%.</p> <p>Romney, neck-and-neck in the national polls with Barack Obama, had been looking for a large jump in the polls as a result of primetime television coverage of the convention, which finally opened Tuesday after the first day was cancelled amid warnings that Isaac was heading for Tampa.</p> <p>Romney had not been planning to arrive until Thursday when he is scheduled to deliver a primetime television speech that is expected to attract an audience of 30 million or more. But he is now competing against television coverage of Isaac, due to hit the Louisiana coast in the early hours of Wednesday. </p> <p>New Orleans, which was hit by hurricane Katrina exactly seven years ago with the loss of 1,800 lives, is in the storm's path, leaving GOP strategists fearing what they term \"split screen\" media coverage, one showing disaster and the other Republicans cheering and celebrating in Tampa.</p> <p>Isaac has completely disrupted Republican election planning. The Romney team needed a substantial poll bounce this week not least because next week it will be the turn of the Democratic party to secure primetime television, at their convention in Charlotte, North Carolina.</p> <p>At the very minimum, the Romney team had hoped to have established a lead that would cancel out Obama's bounce next week.</p> <p>Stevens said he could not predict what will happen in the polls now. \"I have no idea. Of course, this convention is different because of the hurricane. The conventions are different now. They're later now. We're having back-to-back conventions,\" he said.</p> <p>The Obama campaign spent $120m in advertising over the summer, mainly in the swing states, seeking to define Romney as a rich, elitist candidate who had made his fortune off the backs of sacked workers.</p> <p>Although he virtually tied with Romney in the national polls, the Democratic ad campaign appears to have paid off, giving Obama poll leads over Romney in all but two of about 10 swing states. This was to have been Romney's big week, his opportunity to regain lost ground.</p> <p>The main business of the day Tuesday was for the convention to formally adopt Romney as the party's presidential nominee. Although he won the primaries and caucuses against other Republican challengers months ago, he is not legally the challenger to Obama until chosen by a roll-call of delegates at the convention. </p> <p>Once chosen, he can unleash the millions of dollars he has been accumulating for the campaign, hoping to outspend Obama two-to-one in ads over the fall.</p> <p>That plan would have to be revised if there was substantial damage and loss of life along the Louisiana coast.</p> <p>Party officials expressed cautious optimism that the convention will be held without interruption, albeit with a revised schedule that sees some of the speakers who had had slots on Monday being crammed in later in the week. </p> <p>Russ Schriefer, the convention organiser, said: \"We are at full steam ahead with our Tuesday-Wednesday-Thursday schedule.\"</p> <p>Some delegates who were out partying on Monday evening expressed hope that Romney and other speakers at the convention will spend less time attacking on Obama and saying more about what policies Romney would implement as president.</p> <p>Ann Romney was given the primetime slot on Tuesday evening, with the brief of humanising her husband, filling in personal details about a politician so often seen as detached, an image Republicans hope he can help discard this week.</p> <p>Part of her task is also to try to increase her husband's appeal among women voters, among whom Obama enjoys a big poll lead.</p> <p>In a CBS interview on Tuesday morning, she spoke about a miscarriage she suffered in her 40s. Her husband, usually reticent about revealing details of his personal life, appeared taken aback with her openness.</p> <p>She said her son Craig had been devastated when told she was going to lose the baby.</p> <p>\"I was home by the time [Craig] got home from school that afternoon. And he walked in the door, and he was about 10, 11 years old. And he fell on the floor and just burst into tears. And the poor little kid had been at school all day long holding this sorrow inside of him. And having no one to speak to, no one to comfort him, no one to explain what was going on,\" she said.</p> <p>Her husband said he had not heard the story about their son's reaction before. \"I hadn't heard the story about Craig coming home from school that day and being so devastated,\" said the presumptive GOP nominee. \"I'm not surprised. He's a very tender heart and a wonderful father today himself.\"</p>",
  "<p>Are there any bits of American campaign jargon more annoying than the word \"optics\"?</p> <p>It's inescapable this week, thanks to hurricane Isaac: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/28/isaac-hurricane-new-orleans\">Republicans in Tampa are worried about how it will look</a> if television pictures show them partying while the storm wreaks destruction on Gulf Coast communities.</p> <p>But wait! Did you notice how I just managed to explain the GOP's dilemma without using the word \"optics\"? That's because it's a staggeringly pointless piece of jargon that just means \"how things look\" or \"public perception\". Jargon is occasionally defensible when it expresses, in a syllable or two, something that would otherwise take paragraphs to explain. \"Optics\" doesn't do that. Yet <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/80195.html\">here, courtesy of Patrick Gavin at Politico</a>, are 13 instances of campaign personnel or journalists using it in the last few days. (For more, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;output=search&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=site:politico.com+%22optics%22&amp;oq=site:politico.com\">just read Politico any day</a>: its writers love the term.)</p> <p>\"So maybe the biggest problem Republicans will have is optics,\" as CNN's Carol Costello put it. \"You can't have Kid Rock tearing down the house while Isaac tears down houses.\"</p> <p>Indeed.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu/status/240449419433107456\">Journalism professor Jay Rosen is surely right</a> that \"optics\" is a prime symptom of the <a href=\"http://jayrosen.posterous.com/the-savvy-press-and-their-exemption-from-the\">Washington media mindset he calls \"the savvy\"</a> \u2013 \"that quality of being shrewd, practical, well-informed, perceptive, ironic, 'with it', and unsentimental in all things political.\" Such special terms help foster a bond between actual campaign insiders and journalists who want to feel like insiders. As <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/magazine/07FOB-onlanguage-t.html\">Ben Zimmer noted in a New York Times \"On Language\" column</a> on \"optics\" a couple of years ago \u2013 he traced the term's birth, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics\">as a piece of political jargon, to 1978</a> \u2013 it also sounds scientific because, in its original meaning, it is. It thus gives chatter about campaign tactics the appearance of a highly technical body of knowledge, like advanced physics, and makes its users look good.</p> <p>You might even say that \"optics\" is largely a matter of optics, although, of course, I never would.</p> <p>One sinister aspect of all this is the way that \"optics\" helps lend the problem of appearances a sort of stand-alone reality, shorn of all context. Defining the Isaac/Tampa situation as \"a problem of optics\" inevitably implies that it's <em>merely</em> a problem of optics: an embarrassing coincidence, as when newspapers inadvertently juxtapose news stories and ads in tasteless ways. But that's not the case here. Images of weather damage alongside convention-hall balloon drops would be a problem for a reason: because the appalling government failures of Katrina happened under the last Republican president. And because Paul Ryan has <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/blog/169574/gop-concern-disaster-preparedness-doesnt-extend-beyond-tampa\">proposed deep cuts to disaster relief funds</a>. And because the GOP has <a href=\"http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal/2011_08/cantor_no_emergency_disaster_r031861.php\">sought to hold hurricane-relief funding hostage</a> to its tiny-government crusades. Even TV footage of Isaac <em>not</em> proving disastrous \u2013 of, say, New Orleans' reinforced levees holding up \u2013 would draw attention to the helpful role of government in letting societies function, a truth that the Romney campaign has set itself resolutely against.</p> <p>More abstractly \u2013 but no less importantly \u2013 pictures of partying delegates alongside hurricane damage could only emphasize the fundamental disconnection between modern political campaigning and most of the rest of reality. They would underline that 21st-century conventions are, indeed, pure \"optics\", floating free from the facts of most people's lives. Even if the Republicans didn't have a hugely problematic record when it comes to disaster relief, the juxtaposition would risk throwing the strange, choreographed pointlessness of campaigning into stark relief.</p> <p>This is certainly a problem. But it isn't a problem of optics.</p>",
  "<p>My favourite TV programme of all time is, easily, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/apr/10/arrested-development\" title=\"\">Arrested Development</a>, the brilliant show about the fall of a once powerful family, brought down by their own weaknesses, corruption and self-centredness. The sensible adult son, Michael Bluth, tries to rescue his family name and reunite his relatives but the family have no interest in helping Michael or themselves, bent as they are on self-destruction. Whether this is down to selfishness, short-sightedness or stupidity is not always clear but, for whatever reason, Michael can only watch as his family careen ever closer to their end, acting more deranged as they go.</p> <p>I think it is my fondness for Arrested Development that explains my enjoyment of the Republican convention currently taking place in Tampa, Florida. \"Taking place\" was nearly an overstatement as the convention has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/aug/27/tropical-storm-isaac-hits-florida-video\" title=\"\">curtailed owing to fears over hurricane Isaac</a>. Strangely, there&#xa0;has been no word from former presidential candidate and dementor Michele Bachmann or modern-day Savonarola Pat Robertson about how this storm signifies holy displeasure, even though both have previously connected meteorological shifts with God. One year ago, Bachmann <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/michele-bachmann-rally-draws-over-1000-in-sarasota-but-some-prefer-rick/1188559\" title=\"\">claimed</a> that hurricane Irene, which caused at least 56 deaths, was God saying: \"'Are you going to start listening to me here?' \u2026 Government is on a morbid obesity diet and we've got to rein in the spending.\" Robertson <a href=\"http://articles.cnn.com/2010-01-13/us/haiti.pat.robertson_1_pat-robertson-disasters-and-terrorist-attacks-devil?_s=PM:US\" title=\"\">said </a>that Haiti's 2010 earthquake, in which at least&#xa0;100,000 people died, was retribution for the country's \"pact with the devil\". Maybe their speeches were among those that had to be cut because of the weather.</p> <p>This storm, as well as providing political journalists with the most obvious pathetic fallacy and metaphor since Emily Bront\u00eb wrote Wuthering Heights, is both practically and historically awkward for Romney. The Republican party does not have good <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIUzLpO1kxI\" title=\"\">associations</a> with hurricanes, a point only underlined by Isaac, which as well as derailing the convention is <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-isaac-20120828,0,6904391.story\" title=\"\">hitting New Orleans</a>, seven years after the city was all but destroyed by Katrina, a name as <em>verboten</em> among Republicans as G-E-O-R-G-E W B-U-S-H.</p> <p>No party is ever homogenised in its views but, as the New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/27/us/politics/republicans-worry-about-keeping-factions-reined-in.html?_r=1&amp;ref=politics\" title=\"\">reported</a>, the Republican party is \"more factionalised \u2013 ideologically, politically and culturally \u2013 than Republican leaders could imagine in recent history\", and many of the factionalisations are diametrically opposed, such as the hardline social conservatives versus the economic libertarians, who are far less interested in abortion and gay marriage than their vocal brethren.</p> <p>I suspect that the once <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyp2QIGejq4\" title=\"\">pro-choice</a> Romney would prefer these aforementioned vocal conservatives to keep shtoom, seeing as their hardline attitude is a proven vote-loser. Since Missouri Republican Todd Akin's infamous interview last week referring to \"legitimate rape\" he has <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444358404577609942764318520.html\" title=\"\">fallen</a> 20 points in the polls and fewer than two in 10 Americans <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=123314&amp;page=1#.UDym37_ud6N\" title=\"\">support</a> all abortions being banned with no exemptions. Yet, like the Bluths, these guys just can't help themselves. Pennsylvania Senate candidate Tom Smith recently justified his \"no exemptions\" stance by <a href=\"http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2012/08/gop_senate_candidate_likens_ra.html\" title=\"\">saying</a> that a woman becoming pregnant out of wedlock is \"similar\" to pregnancy from rape: \"Put yourself in a father's perspective; yes, it is similar,\" he bleated, proving, were proof needed, that these politicians are unable to put themselves in the woman's perspective and so obsessed with what goes in and out of a woman's vagina that they can't distinguish between rape and consensual sex.</p> <p>As MSNBC's Rachel Maddow <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/48739908/ns/msnbc-rachel_maddow_show/t/rachel-maddow-show-monday-august/#UDymJ7_ud6N\" title=\"\">discussed</a> last week, these tendencies always existed quietly on the sidelines but \"as the Republican party has slipped its moorings post-Bush and Cheney \u2026 these folks have taken over\" and one of them, Paul Ryan, is now the VP candidate. One of Romney's difficulties is that he has to kowtow to these folks&#xa0;on abortion and immigration, but without <a href=\"http://2012.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/08/platform-could-be-messaging-minefield-for-gop.php\" title=\"\">alienating</a> mainstream voters.</p> <p>There is a distinctly apocalyptic feel to this convention. At a <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-gingrich-obama-condones-killing-of-unborn-children-20120826,0,3983266.story\" title=\"\">Faith &amp; Freedom Coalition gathering</a>, former presidential candidate Newt Gingrich and organiser Ralph Reed waxed firebrand evangelical, with the former claiming that President Obama condones the killing of children and the latter describing Obama's America as \"a&#xa0;pockmarked bleak landscape\".</p> <p>This sense of doom is understandable. In a recent <a href=\"http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/08/21/13399788-nbcwsj-poll-heading-into-conventions-obama-has-four-point-lead?lite\" title=\"\">WSJ/NBC poll</a>, Romney scored a grand total of 0% support among black Americans. Yet as white babies now <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/17/us/whites-account-for-under-half-of-births-in-us.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">account</a> for less than half of the births in the US, something will have to give soon in the Republican party's current incarnation.</p> <p>Political reporter Jonathan Chait <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/08/2012-or-never-for-gops-white-base.html\" title=\"\">suggests</a> this explains Romney's hardline approach to the welfare state, trying to get in the changes while he can. Or maybe Romney \u2013 a man so value-free he, as David Brooks <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/28/opinion/brooks-the-real-romney.html\" title=\"\">writes in the New York Times</a>, would keep a mood ring transparent \u2013 is simply going where the party wind blows, even as it blows him over the cliff. It at least partly explains the self-destructive hysteria that has infected the Republicans.</p> <p>At the end of Arrested Development, Michael realises there is no&#xa0;saving his family and flees to Mexico. Considering some of Romney's<a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/2012-gop-presidential-candidates-views-on-immigration-issues/\" title=\"\"> recent statements</a> about immigration, that country probably wouldn't even&#xa0;have him any more.</p>",
  "<p>Spanish banks lost \u20ac1 out of every \u20ac20 deposited with them in July, making it the worst month for deposit flight in 15 years as rumours grew that the country is edging closer to a full bailout.</p> <p>News that banks were losing deposits came as Spain's statistics institute revealed the current recession is worse than thought, with the economy shrinking at an annual rate of 1.3% in the second quarter.</p> <p>\"The downturn in the Spanish economy is deeper than previously thought and accelerating,\" warned Robert O'Daly of the Economist Intelligence Unit.</p> <p>Against this background, European Council president Herman Van Rompuy said it was up to Spain to decide whether to seek eurozone help, after meeting prime minister Mariano Rajoy in Madrid. Rajoy repeated that he needed more details from the European Central Bank to help him decide.</p> <p>Tuesday's revised figures showed recession started three months earlier than previously indicated. \"The data shows the recession started in the third quarter of last year,\" secretary for state for the economy, Fernando Jim\u00e9nez admitted.</p> <p>A collapse in internal consumption in a country squeezed by government austerity and massive unemployment is largely to blame for the recession, as this fell at an annual rate of 3.9% in the second quarter.</p> <p>Unemployment is already at 25% but the speed at which jobs are being destroyed quickened to an average rate of 800,000 jobs a year in the second quarter, according to the statistics institute.</p> <p>That helps explain why Spaniards, and their companies, are both reducing spending and putting less money in the bank.</p> <p>Sources at the Bank of Spain claimed the sudden drop in the amount on deposit was mostly due to banks withdrawing money placed with other entities, but the fall came amid growing consumer anger with retail banks.</p> <p>Tens of thousands of small savers are set to be hit with losses on preference shares they bought in former savings banks that now need bailing out by the eurozone's rescue fund.</p> <p>Spanish banks can take up to \u20ac100bn (\u00a379.7bn) from the fund, but preference shareholders must first bear losses of up to 80%. Many savers who bought the shares thought they were risk-free deposits from high street banks.</p> <p>A new law due to be passed on Friday should settle their part of the bill for a banking crisis whose origins lie in the residential housing bubble that burst four years ago.</p> <p>The new law should also set up a state \"bad bank\" to absorb toxic real estate \u2013 largely worthless building land and unsold new properties \u2013 that forced the nationalisation of several banks.</p> <p>Attempts to stave off a full bailout took a blow on Tuesday when the regional government of Catalonia said it needed \u20ac5bn from a central government rescue fund.</p> <p>Catalonia is one of half a dozen regional governments shut out of markets and needing government help to roll over debt and fund budget deficits. Regions have a combined debt of \u20ac145bn, with \u20ac36bn needing refinancing this year.</p> <p>A report by the Fedea thinktank predicts Catalonia \u2013 which accounts for one fifth of the economy \u2013 will miss the 1.5% deficit target set this year, with an expected 2.5% deficit making it the second worst performing region.</p> <p>Rajoy's conservative central government may eventually take direct control of the region's finances.</p> <p>Regional prime minister Artur Mas, of the Catalan nationalist Convergence and Union coalition, has threatened a snap election if that happens. His spokesman, Francesc Homs, rejected any \"political terms\" for borrowing the money.</p> <p>But as Spain pinned its hopes for avoiding a full bailout on future bond-buying by the European Central Bank, not all news was bad. On Tuesday it managed to borrow \u20ac3.6bn for three and six months at much lower rates than in recent auctions.</p> <p>Exports continue to grow, while unit labour costs fell 2% \u2013 signs that a gradual internal devaluation may be happening.</p> <p>Spain, meanwhile, has enjoyed a summer tourist boom, which generated 9% more income this July than a year earlier.</p>",

In the Netherlands, the euro will dominate a general election campaign that could see another incumbent leader unseated. And in Karlsruhe, Germany's top judges will rule on whether Europe's new bailout mechanism, a key plank in the region's response to the crisis, is legal.</p> <p>Europe's leaders cannot win the battle to save the euro in September, but they can certainly lose it.</p> <h2><strong>Around 5 September: Troika returns to Athens</strong></h2> <p>The debt inspectors return to Greece next week to finish their assessment of the country's long-term growth and debt reduction. The troika's verdict will determine whether Greece receives the next slice of bailout aid, worth \u20ac31.2bn (\u00a324.8bn). Greece's pleas for its austerity programme to be delayed by two years also hang on the report. Back in July, officials from the International Monetary Fund, the ECB and the European commission warned Athens that it was set to miss 210 out of 300 targets, a figure described as \"staggering\" by Martin Koehring at the Economist Intelligence Unit. He fears that a poor report could lead to Greece being ejected from the euro, triggering \"severe contagion\" within the eurozone.</p> <p>\"The Greek bank recapitalisation scheme depends on Greece receiving this \u20ac31.2bn tranche; hence, further delays would create uncertainty about Greek financial stability, and could eventually trigger a Greek disorderly default and euro exit,\" said Koehring.</p> <p>He also fears that some German politicians have concluded, wrongly in his view, that the eurozone could now survive if Greece tumbled out.</p> <p>\"In our view, at a time when the euro area's mechanisms to prevent major contagion are not yet in place (the ECB is not yet a lender of last resort and the euro area's permanent rescue fund has not even been ratified yet), a 'Grexit' could undermine German chancellor Angela Merkel's euro rescue strategy fundamentally \u2026 A 'Grexit' before the firewall around Spain and Italy is sufficiently strong could thus herald the end of the euro area as a whole.\"</p> <p>The report was scheduled for mid-September, but could drag into October (as they say in the City, bad numbers take longer to add up\u2026).</p> <h2><strong>6 September: ECB governing council meeting</strong></h2> <p>It is not often that a monthly meeting of the ECB's governing council is described as eagerly awaited. Expectations are high for a major new bond-buying programme to drive down Spain and Italy's borrowing costs, but there are also fears that the Bundesbank will refuse to allow it. After ECB president Mario Draghi pledged last month to do everything within his mandate to protect the eurozone, City experts fear a rout if he fails to deliver. \"Prices are only where they are now because there is a very material expectation priced in that the ECB will intervene. If September's meeting gives those expectations a knockback, we're really in trouble, and could see a level of crisis not seen before,\" said Paul McNamara at investment management firm GAM. McNamara believes it is crucial that the ECB puts its balance sheet into play to calm the crisis.</p> <p>There were rumours last week that the ECB might announce new caps on Spain and Italy's borrowing costs. This appears unlikely, though. McNamara predicts Draghi will \"keep Italy and Spain's feet to the fire\" by pledging to make unlimited interventions, but not at a set price. That would maintain the pressure on both countries to keep reforming their economies.</p> <p>\"The balance of probability is very strong that we will not seen an explicit yield target,\" said McNamara. It is also likely that the ECB will only agree to start mopping up sovereign debt in the 'secondary market' if the eurozone's bailout funds have already begun buying bonds at auction, following a formal request for help from a sovereign.</p> <h2><strong>12 September: German constitutional court ruling</strong></h2> <p>Germany's highest court is considering whether the European stability mechanism, the new permanent bailout fund for struggling eurozone countries, is legal. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/aug/28/eurozone-bailout-german-objections\" title=\"\">Opponents of the fund claim it violates the \"no bailout\" clause written in the Maastricht treaty, and could leave Germany facing immense losses</a>. The court could insist on certain amendments, or qualifications, in return for Germany's backing. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, fears that anything short of full approval would \"leave that spanner in the works\", as questions over the fund would drag on into the autumn. Confusion would also undermine any decisions taken by the ECB on 6 September.</p> <h2><strong>12 September: Netherlands general election</strong></h2> <p>The Dutch government <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/apr/23/eurozone-crisis-austerity-dutch-government\" title=\"\">collapsed in April 2012</a> after far-right leader Geert Wilders refused to back its emergency budget. Four months on, it is left-wing leader Emile Roemer, not Wilders, who is on track for major gains at the ballot box. Latest polls put Roemer's Socialist party ahead of the incumbent Liberals. This matters because if Roemer wins he is likely to push for a less austere approach to the crisis, potentially shaking the northern European consensus. Political analysts warn, though, that the Socialists may struggle to form a coalition.</p> <h2><strong>Late September: French budget for 2013</strong></h2> <p>With public support already sliding, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's government could face a backlash when it presents its budget for 2013. It is likely to cut its growth forecasts, which would mean new spending cuts or higher taxes to keep France's deficit reduction plans on target.</p>",
  "<p>If you've been following the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/pussy-riot\" title=\"\">Pussy Riot</a> story in Russia, you have by now read any number of pieces decrying the chummy relationship between church and state, amid new fears that Russia is going back to the dark ages. But to interpret the imprisonment of political activists at the church's behest as a regression is to miss the point. For Russia is not a nation looking backwards but resolutely moving forward, on a course set out for her long ago at the very founding of the Russian Orthodox church.</p> <p>The Russian church was born out of the <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/88250/caesaropapism\" title=\"\">byzantine system of Caesaropapism</a> \u2013 literally, Caesar before pope \u2013 which from the get-go empowered Russia's leaders not just to rule over the church but also to use it for political gain. \"The duty of the clergy,\" Orlando Figes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/orlando-figes?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">explained in Natasha's Dance: A Cultural History of Russia</a>, \"was to uphold and enforce the tsar's authority, to read out state decrees from the pulpit, to carry out administrative duties for the state, and inform the police about all dissent and criminality\".</p> <p>Fast forward several very dark centuries (most notably the one belonging to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_IV_of_Russia\" title=\"\">Ivan the Terrible</a>), and decades of brutal Bolshevik persecution, to Joseph Stalin who, in the face of Teutonic invasion, resurrected the Orthodox church and co-opted its emaciated remains into the state apparatus to fight in the war against Russia's internal and external enemies. The church justified its consent as the only way to ensure its survival but in the intervening decades, the clergy's vociferous support of the Kremlin made it difficult to say where state ambition ended, and the church's began.</p> <p>For a brief blink after Soviet collapse, the co-dependency between church and state appeared to have imploded, much like the country itself. Boris Yeltsin bowed in mosques, sang in synagogues and struggled to keep upright during mass but, much like the women of Pussy Riot, he did not cross himself correctly, nor did he demonstrate a particular desire to promote the Orthodox cause. For Patriarchate Yeltsin was a \"podsvechnik\", or candleholder, meaning he did as much for the church as an inanimate object dripping with wax.</p> <p>Enter Vladimir Putin, the man whose cold, grey eyes revealed to George W Bush \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/may/20/russia.usa\" title=\"\">a sense of his soul</a>\". That was after Putin told the former US president a story about a fire that had burned down his dacha outside St Petersburg: Putin had dashed into the inferno to rescue his two sleeping daughters from death. When an aluminium cross given to young Vladimir by his devout mother was later found among the ashes, the Russian leader said he had a \"revelation\". In other words Putin, like Bush, claimed to be born again.</p> <p>It is easy to dismiss this story as a classic example of an apparatchik having cased and turned his target. Only the Putin era tells many such stories: the president taking sacrament on state-run television. The president travelling on holy pilgrimages and surrounding himself with other \"Orthodox Chekists\", men like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/12/st-petersburg-bans-homosexual-propaganda\" title=\"\">Georgy Poltavchenko</a>, an old KGB hand who in 2002 told a university audience that Russia was \"God's chosen country\".</p> <p>The church has mostly played the role of enthusiastic accomplice: Orthodox priests sprinkled holy water on nuclear warheads and blessed military factories, navy vessels and army aeroplanes while mugging for cameras. \"Orthodox culture classes\" were introduced in public schools. The president's enemies <a href=\"http://www.kommersant.com/p905231/r_530/human_rights_and_freedoms/\" title=\"\">were steadily condemned</a> (the young women of Pussy Riot were officially denounced as \"anti-Russian forces\"). The dissident Gleb Yakunin excavated evidence from the KGB archives in the 1990s that fingered high-ranking priests as KGB agents, including the former head of the church, Aleksei II, and the current, Patriarch Kirill I. When we met in Moscow a few years ago, Father Gleb put it this way: \"Having spent so many years being psychologically coerced by the KGB, the church is readily adaptable.\"</p> <p>The Pussy Riot women were locked up for protesting against a meeting between Putin and Patriarch Kirill one month before Putin's re-election. The politician had asked the priest for his blessing. The old priest <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/02/08/uk-russia-putin-religion-idUKTRE81722Y20120208\" title=\"\">did one better</a>, pronouncing the Putin era \"a miracle of God\". \"We must move away from the primitive notion of separation between church and state,\" Putin said in response. \"On the contrary, we must devote ourselves to the totally different idea of co-operation.\" He then pledged $120m to build more churches.</p> <p>And so Russia moves forward. No, this is not a return to the ancien regime; not a Byzantine or imperial or Soviet homecoming, as the Putin presidency has been described. It is the evolution of all of these things, the next act, the latest triumph by Russia's rulers over enemies real and imagined in the long and sorrowful history of a nation determined to be the centre of the world.</p>",
  "<p>\"Politics is theatre,\" said the late Harvey Milk. \"It doesn't matter if you win. You make a statement. You say, 'I'm here, pay attention to me.'\"</p> <p>There is nothing quite as self-consciously theatrical as a presidential-nominating convention. Once a place where candidates were actually chosen, platforms hammered out and debates hosted, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/aug/24/dan-rather-gary-younge-longer-video?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+theguardian%2Fmedia%2Frss+%28Media%29\">they are now little more than infomercials</a>, with all the nutritional content and social value of a TV microwave dinner for one.</p> <p>At a time when Americans are increasingly disenchanted with their mainstream political culture, this is the two big parties' quadrennial opportunity to hog primetime, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/01/uselections2008.usa\">cover it with confetti</a>, bury it in balloons and say: \"I'm here, pay attention to me.\"</p> <p>But the political function of conventions has withered in inverse proportion to its electoral importance. Because nothing is decided, everything can be curated. Its role is no longer to chose a nominee but to display them; not to engage in politics but perform it. After a gruelling primary and deluge of negative ads, it's a party's single best chance to reintroduce their candidate on their own terms.</p> <p>That would describe Mitt Romney's journey to Tampa thus far. Despite a huge monetary advantage against a weak and eccentric field, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/mar/21/illinois-republican-primary-mitt-romney\">he struggled to stamp his authority</a> on a race against opponents who should have been rounding errors.</p> <p>Since then, there has been an onslaught of ads from the Obama campaign that have turned what he believed to be his principle strength \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/18/mitt-romney-turning-into-john-kerry-2012-election\">his business experience</a> \u2013 into a weakness.</p> <p>The upshot? <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2012/08/02/romneys-personal-image-remains-negative/\">People don't much like him</a>. Given any polling metric on favourability \u2013 \"<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/romneys-favorability-ratings-stall/2012/08/07/b9b8c612-e0fa-11e1-a421-8bf0f0e5aa11_blog.html\">Does he understand the concerns of people like you</a>\", \"<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-20/obama-leads-in-poll-as-voters-view-romney-as-out-of-touch.html\">Is he in touch with average Americans</a>\" \u2013 he both fails and trails. </p> <p>The fact that Democrats don't like him is to be expected. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/14/opinion/granderson-romney-likeability/index.html\">As one Democratic CNN contributor put it</a>: \"There are moments in some of Romney's speeches in which he comes across like the guy who doesn't wave when you let him into traffic, because in his mind, he was able to merge on his own \u2026 Few people ever like that guy.\"</p> <p>The problem is Republicans don't like him much either. </p> <p>Last month in West Virginia <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/issues/58_1/John-Boehner-Voters-Need-Not-Love-Mitt-Romney-215934-1.html\">a woman asked Republican House speaker John Boehner</a>: \"Can you make me love Mitt Romney?\" Boehner said: \"No. Listen, we're just politicians. I wasn't elected to play God. The American people probably aren't going to fall in love with Mitt Romney.\"</p> <p>The task of the Republican establishment in this primary is as straightforward as it is tough. They have three days, weather permitting, to authenticate Romney. They have to transform him from a political candidate into a likeable person people can relate to; to convince the public that he is more than the sum of his calculations; to turn a resume into a human story; to make flesh from wood. To turn the first viable Mormon presidential candidate into a person Americans would like to have a beer with.</p> <p>This challenge exists on two fronts. The first is ideological and is primarily an issue for Republicans. Over the years he has taken a number of <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2104314,00.html\">positions at odds with the GOP's new conservative orthodoxy</a>. He has been pro-choice, pro-cap and trade and introduced the blueprint for Obama's healthcare plan in Massachusetts. After four years of careering to the right and vowing no compromises the Republicans have ended up with a candidate with a record to the left of some Democrats. </p> <p>Put bluntly, many do not trust him because they do not believe that in his gut he is a devout conservative. There is no real solution to this. What is done is done. He can only hope that the selection of Paul Ryan fires up the base and that those not excited by him are sufficiently repelled by Obama to get to the polls.</p> <p>The other is personal and an issue for everybody. He is incredibly stiff, particularly when compared to Barack Obama. He's been running as a CEO and to many that's precisely whom he reminds them of. Not their leader but their boss. <a href=\"http://www.garyyounge.com/?p=\" 1421\"\">As Mike Huckabee observed in 2008</a>, \"People would rather elect a president who reminds them of the guy they work with, not the guy who laid them off.\"</p> <p>There is no easy solution to this either. The problem is not just that he's too scripted. It's that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/feb/29/mitt-romney-republican-nomination-win-michigan\">when he strays from the script things get worse</a>. That's when he starts offering primary opponents $10,000 bets, talking about his friends who own Nascar teams and boasting that his wife has \"a couple of Cadillacs\". Each time he reminds people not only that he's a very rich man \u2013 which is not a big problem in American politics \u2013 but that he has a tin ear for the sensitivities of an electorate struggling through a deep recession.</p> <p>In an election where <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/comment/2012/08/searching-for-the-undecided-voter.html\">most people have already made up their minds</a> and there are few real undecideds, there is only so much Obama-bashing can really achieve. The convention organisers must find a way to either write him a script in his own voice that makes him look comfortable in his own skin or to teach him how to go off script without losing the plot. All the time the string of surrogates must vouch for him as a man of principle and colour in the spaces of his personal story beyond business without going outside the lines.</p> <p>In March Romney's campaign adviser Eric Fehrnstrom was asked if the candidate was being pushed too far to the right. \"Well, I think you hit a reset button for the fall campaign,\" he said. \"Everything changes. It's almost like an <a href=\"http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/romneys-etch-a-sketch\">Etch A Sketch</a>. You can kind of shake it up and restart all over again.\" </p> <p>The hurricanes are here. Summer is drawing to an end. His opponents have drawn him as Forrest Gump. When the shaking is done his handlers have to turn him into Tom Hanks. Let the show begin.</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney is flying into Tampa on Tuesday morning in the hope of kickstarting the Republicans' sputtering national convention into life.</p> <p>After tropical storm Isaac forced the cancellation of Monday's planned opening, the main business of Tuesday will be to hold a rollcall of delegates to officially nominate Romney as the Republican presidential nominee, a formality that will allow him to unleash millions of dollars he has been accumulating for the campaign.</p> <p>Even if business is disrupted later this week if Isaac creates havoc in New Orleans, Romney will at least have completed the bare minimum \u2013 the necessary legal process of the rollcall.</p> <p>Party officials are hopeful that, short of a disaster in New Orleans, they will be able to complete the remaining three days of the convention without further interruption.</p> <p>Russ Schriefer, the convention organiser, said on Monday evening: \"We are at full steam ahead with our Tuesday-Wednesday-Thursday schedule.\"</p> <p>The Republican national committee chairman, Reince Priebus, insisted no further changes to the schedule were planned nor had there been any discussion about extending the convention to Friday. </p> <p>Priebus acknowledged that events in New Orleans could alter convention plans. \"If we have to do anything to incorporate some of the occurrences around this into our schedule and programme \u2026 and what that means I don't know. I can just assure you we are moving on. We're planning on having all three days. We will be nimble if we need to be,\" Priebus told CNN.</p> <p>The convention hall was largely empty Monday apart from journalists. Delegates spent the rain-soaked day in their hotels or at many receptions that went ahead despite heavy downpours.</p> <p>Some supporters of Ron Paul, the libertarian who was among Romney's challengers for the nomination earlier this year, could mount a small demonstration during the rollcall. But party organisers expressed confidence this will not happen after a backroom compromise was worked out over complaints that grassroots power was being curtailed.</p> <p>As well as the rollcall, the party has a line-up of speakers on Tuesday that include Rick Santorum, Romney's main challenger during the primaries and caucuses, governor of South Carolina Nikki Haley, one of the rising stars of the party, and the popular New Jersey governor Chris Christie. Ann Romney has been given top billing. Her task is to humanise her husband, filling in personal details about a politician so often seen as detached, an image Republicans hope he can help discard this week.</p> <p>Wednesday, unless there is further disruption, is scheduled to be dominated by Romney's running mate Paul Ryan and Thursday by Romney, when he makes his nomination acceptance speech.</p> <p>Republicans have not released Romney's schedule for Tuesday. Normally, the candidate would not turn up at the convention venue. Romney could break with that tradition to hear his wife speak or he could may opt to watch it from a hotel room.</p> <p>Isaac has distracted attention from what would have been \u2013 and may still be \u2013 one of the big issues of the week, the party split over abortion. Romney, in an interview with CBS on Monday, said he opposed abortion except \"in the case of rape and incest, and the health and life of the mother\". Until now, the only exceptions he had allowed were rape and incest. Ryan opposed exceptions for incest and rape too until he joined the ticket.</p>",

One solution that so far seems to have been overlooked by governments and the media in the impasse on WikiLeaks's Julian Assange since Ecuador granted him asylum is for the UK government to allow his safe passage from Ecuador's embassy in London to Ecuador's embassy in Stockholm, Sweden. This would meet all parties' obligations under both domestic and international law. The UK could meet its obligations to transfer Assange to face the criminal investigation in Sweden. Sweden could have the opportunity to pursue its investigations in Sweden. Ecuador could maintain international law obligations to protect Assange from extradition to the US to face unfair trial on espionage charges and a potential death penalty. And Assange himself would have the opportunity to have the alleged criminal charges addressed through the normal legal processes.</p> <p>When solutions exist that meet the obligations of all parties, it seems extraordinary that the UK would risk undermining long-standing diplomatic principles for providing political asylum to dissidents faced with political persecution.<br><strong>Michael Hamel-Green</strong><br>Coburg, Victoria, Australia</p> <p>\u2022 The right of asylum in embassies is one of the most sacred of Latin American traditions.

  "<p>The Romney camp has finally gotten it.</p> <p>No, not about whether rape can ever be \"legitimate\". Or whether contraception is a fundamental right. No, what they have finally gotten is that they are likely to lose this election because of women.</p> <p>Clear evidence of this is the <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/health/2012/08/26/745521/romney-touts-romneycare-im-the-guy-that-got-healthcare-for-all-the-women-and-men-in-my-state/?mobile=nc\">volte-face the Romney camp has done in the past few days on \"Romneycare\"</a>, a topic that it had treated as thoroughly radioactive until now. And the Obama camp is banking on a case of irreconcilable differences between the Republicans and, come November, a majority of voting women to put them over the top.</p> <p>In a sane Republican party, Romneycare, the healthcare overhaul Romney implemented as governor of Massachusetts and which Obamacare closely resembles, would be a major selling-point. It's overwhelmingly popular in Massachusetts, delivering to residents the highest percentage of insurance coverage in the country.</p> <p>But sanity long since quit the Republican party. Republicans just plain hate Obamacare and they've pledged to wipe it out, root and branch. Romney, ever compliant towards the radicals in his party, ran away from his own signature governing accomplishment during the primary season as fast as he could.</p> <p>Until now. In a <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/08/26/romney-reinforces-his-support-for-women-points-to-record/\">Fox News interview on Sunday, Romney declared</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"With regards to women's healthcare, look, I'm the guy that was able to get healthcare for all the women and men in my state.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The host, Chris Wallace, parried, \"So you're saying, look at Romneycare?\" To which Romney replied, \"Absolutely. I'm proud of what we did.\"</p> <p>In belatedly embracing Romneycare, <a href=\"http://thehill.com/opinion/columnists/markos-moulitas/222119-gender-gap-will-remain-for-romney-\">Romney is trying to make up lost ground</a> on a policy that women are significantly more likely to support than men. By a wide margin, women are more likely to support health insurance requirements than men. Yet Romney, as always, hopes to have it both ways. He hopes that the public won't notice that, in order to satisfy his party, what he is really promising is not only the repeal of Obamacare, but also the destruction of Medicare, to be replaced by the Ryan voucher plan.</p> <p>So, it's unlikely that a few insincere words delivered via a Fox News interview is going to mend Romney's broken relationship with women. And the fact is, it was never good to begin with.</p> <p>Romney has consistently suffered from a significant gender gap, with Obama's lead among women clocking in at between 16 to 20 percentage points in April. <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/poll-obama-romney-neck-and-neck-ahead-of-party-conventions/2012/08/26/62882360-efc3-11e1-adc6-87dfa8eff430_story_1.html\">Although that has since narrowed</a>, a recent <a href=\"http://polltracker.talkingpointsmemo.com/\">ABC/Washington Post poll gives</a> Obama a 6 percentage point advantage nation-wide among women. Obama's advantage with women continues to more than offset Romney's advantage with men \u2013 enough, at this point, to deliver victory to Obama in November.</p> <p>What the Romney camp is trying to come to terms with is that, in this election, caring and compassion are trumping perceptions of competence in managing the economy. In a recent CNN poll, 53% of likely voters stated that Obama is more in touch with the problems facing middle-class Americans, compared to only 39% who stated that Romney is more in touch. In contrast, Romney bested Obama by 48% to 44% on competence in managing the economy. Tellingly, though, Obama leads Romney 60% to 31% on the question of who is more in touch with the problems facing women today.</p> <p>In reality, Romney's plan (that is, Paul Ryan's plan) for the economy would be an utter catastrophe, with savage cuts to government spending leading to a severely depressed economy, a skyrocketing deficit, and untold misery for the average American for years on end while the rich benefit. Despite Romney's unmerited reputation for competence in stewarding the economy, voters \u2013 women voters, to be exact \u2013 are signalling that Romney's vision of America is too extreme, too callous, too destructive.</p> <p>Arguably, it might be the wrong comparison, but the conclusion is correct. I'll take it, flaws and all.</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney might think the most he has to deal with this week is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/27/republicans-disruption-isaac-new-orleans\" title=\"\">the approach of tropical storm Isaac</a> and his upcoming convention speech, but the Republican presidential candidate has also just been landed with a 130-year-old bill for $25,000 (\u00a316,000) from the author Judith Freeman.</p> <p>Freeman, author of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/28/usa.biography\" title=\"\">a well-received biography of Raymond Chandler</a> and four novels, has traced her family history back to the 1870s, when her great-grandfather William Jordan Flake and Romney's great grandfather Miles P Romney \"were patriarchs of adjoining Mormon communities in the high, cold, hard country of northern Arizona, a region known as Apache County\". Although both men ran into trouble with local communities over their \"scandalous practice of polygamy\", Flake was a \"deeply respected man\", according to Freeman. Romney, on the other hand, was described by one newspaper editor as \"a mass of putrid pus and rotten goose pimples; a skunk, with the face of a baboon, the character of a louse, the breath of a buzzard and the record of a perjurer and common drunkard.\"</p> <p>US marshals were rounding up polygamists and arresting them at the time, and both men became targets and were eventually arrested. Flake posted bail of $1,000 for Romney, who had no money, <a href=\"http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?type=&amp;id=877&amp;fulltext=1&amp;media=\" title=\"\">Freeman writes in the Los Angeles Review of Books</a>, and \"now we come to the matter I'd like to bring up with Mitt\".</p> <p>Miles P Romney, she says, then fled to Mexico, where Mitt's father George was born, while Flake served a six-month sentence for polygamy.</p> <p>\"The point is Miles P Romney never bothered to repay my great-grandfather Flake the thousand dollars he owed him for posting his bail. Since it's never too late to make a situation right, and since Mitt Romney seems to have sufficient funds now to cover his ancestor's old debt, I'd like to call upon him to do so,\" writes Freeman. Since the younger Romney's estimated fortune is some $230m, the bill should not be too much of a stretch.</p> <p>She has worked out that $1,000 from the 1880s would be worth about $25,000 today \u2013 she's willing to let the interest slide. \"Because William Jordan Flake has about 15,000 descendants living at the moment, I realize I'll have to divide up the money should Romney do the right thing and write out that check,\" she says. \"However, I want to assure Mitt that I'm more than happy to be the disburser of the funds and I guarantee that all the Flakes of the world will get their fair share the moment he does the right thing.\"</p>",

Venezuela's President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez has reportedly been acting as a facilitator for the preliminary talks.</p> <p>The last time time the Farc sat down to peace talks in 1999 the government granted the rebels a 42,000 square kilometre swath of land as a safe haven in which to conduct the negotiations. But after two years the Farc were stronger, larger and bolder than ever in their attacks on the military and civilians. Talks broke down in 2002 after the Farc hijacked a commercial plane and kidnapped a senator.</p> <p>\"We are going to learn from the errors of the past,\" said Santos in a clear reference to those failed talks. \"Any [peace] process has to lead to the end of the conflict, not prolong it.\"</p> <p>Even as preliminary talks have been going on the Farc have stepped up their attacks in an apparent show of strength before discussing peace. According to the defence ministry acts of \"terrorism\" were up 53% in the first seven months of this year compared with the same period last year. On Sunday a car bomb blamed on the Farc killed six people including two children in the south-eastern town of Vistahermosa.</p> <p>But the guerrilla leadership has been making peace overtures for months. In January the Farc's new senior leader, Rodrigo Londo\u00f1o, also known by the alias Timichenko, called for talks and then announced an end to kidnapping for ransom, which had been one of the government's demands.</p> <p>In April the group released the last 10 of its security force hostages, some of whom had been held for 14 years.&#xa0;The government then got congress to approve a constitutional amendment that lays the legal groundwork for an eventual peace process with rebels.</p> <p>The country's second-largest guerrilla group, the National Liberation Army, or ELN, told Reuters on Monday that it would join the Farc in peace talks with the government.</p>"
