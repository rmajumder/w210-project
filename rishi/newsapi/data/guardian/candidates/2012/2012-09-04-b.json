  "<p>The Obama campaign's use of sophisticated digital tools designed to oil its ground operation and increase engagement with voters on the doorstep could give the president a one or two point advantage over Mitt Romney in the key battleground states upon which the outcome of the election depends, his campaign manager has predicted.</p> <p>Jim Messina, who heads an army of several hundred staffers that has been working for 18 months to secure Obama's re-election, said that the digital campaign that has been assembled this year to interact with voters is \"light years ahead of where we were in 2008. We're going to make 2008 on the ground look like Jurassic Park\".</p> <p>He also claimed that Democrat's investment in innovations <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/14/obama-digital-campaigning-dashboard\">such as the canvassing tool set Dashboard</a> and a massive database of voters' details <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/17/obama-digital-data-machine-facebook-election \">that interfaces with Facebook</a> had left the Republicans standing.</p> <p>\"The Romney campaign are doing more than the McCain campaign did [in 2008], I want to give them credit for that. But they are nowhere near where we are on the ground,\" Messina told an event at the Democratic National Convention sponsored by ABC News and Yahoo News.</p> <p>He gave examples from two important swing states \u2013 North Carolina where the convention is being held and where the Obama campaign has 50 field offices up and running while the Romney campaign has yet to open its 20th; and Ohio where the disparity on the ground is even greater at 100 Obama offices to Romney's 30.</p> <p>Messina said that a two-point bounce in key swing states such as Florida, Ohio, Iowa and Colorado could be decisive in determining the outcome of the 6 November election. \"This election is going to be very close. We have been building a ground operation that will give us the one or two points that we need to win these states and we are on track to do that.\"</p> <p>Messina's comments on the 2012 election's ground war were unusually direct for the Obama campaign. The Chicago headquarters that is spearheading the effort to re-elect the president normally avoids discussion of its technical operations for fear of giving away trade secrets to the opposition.</p> <p>The Chicago team prides itself with having developed over the past five years, since Obama launched his first bid for the White House in 2007, the most sophisticated digital campaign in global political history. It is centred around a gargantuan unified database of millions of voter files which, through Dashboard, volunteers can access anywhere at any time. That, combined with Facebook and online micro-targetting of specific groups of undecided voters, has allowed the campaign to amplify and extend the traditional door-to-door efforts of volunteers digitally.</p> <p>While Obama has put a large portion of his war chest behind the largest and best oiled ground operation ever seen, Romney and his Super PAC supporters have taken a more conventional approach of blitzing battleground states with largely negative television advertising. The outcome of the presidential race could in part hinge on this fundamental difference \u2013 a modern digital campaign versus a conventional TV one.</p> <p>Ben LaBolt, the Obama campaign's chief spokesman, said that the president had an important advantage over his Republican challenger. Obama took the unprecedented decision at the end of the 2008 race to leave his digital campaign largely intact, redirecting it to help fight battles faced by his administration such as the passage of healthcare reform.</p> <p>That means that he was able to start campaigning for re-election historically early. \"We have been organising in this campaign for 500 days; while the Republicans were out there pummelling each other during the primaries, our supporters were talking to their friends and neighbours about the president's record and vision,\" LaBolt said.</p> <p>While the 2012 digital campaign launched by the Obama team undoubtedly looks slick, many of the claims made for it have so far been unsubstantiated by any solid data. Messina claimed that the campaign has registered 150% more voters and knocked on 147% more doors this year than at this stage in 2008, though whether or not that translates into actual votes cast remains one of the big questions of this presidential election cycle.</p>",

  "<p>First lady Michelle Obama will have the starring role on the opening day of the Democratic convention, tasked with winning back disaffected voters and defending some of the president's more unpopular decisions such as healthcare reform.</p> <p>Campaign aides told reporters before the first lady's primetime keynote address in Charlotte, North Carolina on Tuesday night that she was in the best position to offer a personal insight into the president's almost four years in office, a period that has seen the euphoria that greeted his election give away to disillusionment.</p> <p>Stephanie Cutter, Obama's deputy campaign manager, said that unlike Ann Romney at the Republican convention last week, Michelle Obama did not need to introduce herself or her husband to the American people.</p> <p>\"Everybody knows the first lady, everybody knows the president. But what the first lady can do better than anybody else is give a lens into the values that drive the president.\"</p> <p>Michelle Obama, who is consistently more popular than her husband in opinion polls, is aiming to cement the support of women, Latinos and the gay community \u2013 the president has a significant lead among all three \u2013 and re-energise liberals disappointed that the president has not done enough. In her speech, she will spell out some of Obama's personal motivations behind key decisions.</p> <p>The prevailing mood among delegates in Charlotte is anxiety over Obama's re-election prospects as economic recover remains sluggish \u2013 a stark contrast to the optimism and confidence of the 2008 convention.</p> <p>The economy will dominate the event, which kicked off amid a row over whether voters were better off now than four years ago. A poll for<a href=\"http://gop12.thehill.com/2012/09/the-hill-poll-tough-fundamentals-for.html\"> the Hill magazine on Monday </a>found that 52% of voters surveyed felt worse off now than when Obama took office, and that 54% that he did not deserve re-election based solely on his job performance.</p> <p>Obama will attempt to overturn those concerns on Thursday night at a rally in a 73,000-seater football stadium where he will deliver his speech accepting the Democratic nomination. It will focus almost entirely on the economy, and will lay out a \"road map for what the next four years should look like\", White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer told a Politico panel session on Tuesday morning.</p> <p>Michelle, who initially advised her husband against going into politics and who was reluctantly co-opted into campaigning in 2008, has been much more active in this campaign, particularly with fundraising. She has given 24 speeches since March in 10 states.</p> <p>Speaking at an ABC News and Yahoo News event in Charlotte, Cutter indicated that the first lady would be talking about some of the personal experiences in the president's life that has led him to make some of the difficult and \"unpopular\" choices he has made in his first term. </p> <p>She gave the example of his health reform, dubbed \"Obamacare\" by his opponents. The health reform was motivated in part, Cutter suggested, by the fact that Barack Obama's mother, Ann Dunham, struggled to find health insurance as she was dying from cancer.</p> <p>\"Very politically unpopular, a tough thing to get done, we've been trying for 70 years to get it done. But his mother had a healthcare story in her final days, and it was that memory that drove him to get healthcare done.\"</p> <p>Cutter also pointed to the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, the first bill signed into law by the president that increased the power of women suffering from discrimination to seek legal redress. She said that the president's grandmother had been passed over for promotion at the local bank where she worked by male workers doing the same job she did.</p> <p>\"These choices come from a place of personal experience, and Michelle can speak very personally about that motivation and values and all of the things that drive him to do the things he does. She is a first-person testament to what the president has done over the last four years to show some pretty strong leadership in trying times,\" Cutter said.</p> <p>Ledbetter is among those invited to speak to the convention.</p> <p>Obama and vice-president Joe Biden are to be formally nominated as the party's White House candidates on Wednesday.</p> <p>In his speech on Thursday, Obama will set out his plans for a second term, including completion of healthcare and education reforms.</p> <p>A theme that appears to be developing from the Obama campaign is that should voters give him the chance of a second term, he would use it to create \"an economy built to last\". </p> <p>Ben LaBolt, Obama's campaign press secretary, said the focus of the convention would be \"on the pillars of an economy built to last: energy, manufacturing, education, restoring economic security for the middle class with investments in these areas instead of cutting back.\"</p> <p>The party would hear, he said, \"where we are going to go from here. That's what we didn't hear [from the Republicans] in Tampa last week.</p> <p>But other campaign staff hinted that there would be little new in the way of policy detail in Obama's speech.</p> <p>Aides suggested that the president would also show an element of humility over his record. </p> <p>Senior White House adviser Valerie Jarrett, an old ally of the Obamas from Chicago and now one of the most powerful people in the administration, admitted the president had made a mistake in his first year in office by failing to get out around the country to sell his reforms.</p> <p>Speaking at a convention event organised by Bloomberg, she said the president \"did not appreciate how important it was to tell that story\".</p> <p>Wednesday's keynote speech by Bill Clinton, who was critical of Obama during the 2008, is the only convention speech not yet vetted by the Obama campaign team.</p> <p>Jen Psaki, a campaign spokeswoman travelling with the president, claimed to be relaxed about the lack of an advance copy: \"We have absolute confidence about what he's going to say.\"</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 \"Are you better off than four years ago?\" was the question dominating the news cycle as the Democratic convention got underway in Charlotte today \u2013 though a fairer one, arguably, might have been \"are you better off than if John McCain had been elected, not least since he might have triggered an impulsive nuclear war just because he was in a bad mood one morning?\" Be that as it may, there's one group that's clearly worse off than in 2008: America's campaign journalists. Covering what they're calling \"the worst campaign ever\" (<a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/worst--campaign--ever--obama-and-romney-aren%E2%80%99t-telling-the-truth-about-much--does-it-matter-.html\">Yahoo News</a>) is \"joyless\" (the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/02/magazine/feel-the-loathing-on-the-campaign-trail.html?pagewanted=all\">New York Times</a>), \"a grinding, joyless slog\" (<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0612/77620.html\">Politico</a>), marked by \"ennui\" (<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0612/77620.html\">Dan Rather</a>) and a \"treadmill existence\" (<a href=\"http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=8C836088-D953-46EB-9B4B-322D6A2CF339\">Politico again</a>). Except that in North Carolina, their hotels don't necessarily even come with treadmills. Staff of the Daily Caller website have been assigned \"the worst hotel you can imagine\", <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/315765/crack-hotels-dnc-john-fund\">complains its editor</a>, Tucker Carlson. \"Two guys were dealing drugs in the room next to me, and a prostitute was working out of the parking lot,\" adds a reporter for the conservative National Review \u2013 who you might have expected to celebrate such displays of entrepreneurialism, but who fled to alternative accommodations instead. Oh, and it's <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=charlotte+nc+weather&amp;aq=f&amp;sugexp=chrome,mod=0&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">forecast to rain</a> most of the week in Charlotte, because Barack Obama doesn't believe in America.</p> <p>\u2022 The party conventions, another prominent American journalist observes, are \"vulgar\", \"ugly\", \"stupid\" and \"tedious... one sits through long sessions wishing heartily that all the delegates and alternates were dead and in hell.\" But that was <a href=\"http://articles.boston.com/2012-09-02/opinion/33536770_1_republican-convention-presidential-convention-ipad-apps\">H L Mencken, writing in 1924,</a> which perhaps helps keep the \"worst campaign ever\" stuff in perspective. </p> <p>\u2022 Have you seen the video, which just surfaced this week, of Republican Senator Orrin Hatch and the rest of the Utah delegation at the Republican convention, <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/mckaycoppins/orrin-hatch-does-a-call-me-maybe-video\">covering Carly Rae Jepsen's chart-topping single Call Me Maybe</a>? No? Good. Keep it that way. </p> <p>\u2022 Back in June, the world learned of the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mitt-romneys-summer-vacation-full-of-competitive-sports-and-family-meetings/2012/06/30/gJQAsDFDEW_story.html\">\"Romney Olympics\"</a>, a \"highly competitive regimen of sports and games\" in which the vast Romney family is expected to participate during holidays. (Activities include biking, swimming and running, but also, the Washington Post revealed, \"who can hammer the most nails into a board in two minutes\"; weirdly, \"affixing dogs to roof-racks\" doesn't feature.) Just in time for his make-or-break speech on Thursday, the Obama campaign has finally responded, via <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/03/us/politics/obama-plays-to-win-in-politics-and-everything-else.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;hp&amp;pagewanted=all\">a New York Times profile</a> portraying the president as even more annoyingly hyper-competitive than his opponent. \"When you all have kids, it's important to let them win,\" he once told White House interns. \"Until they're a year old. Then start winning.\" In his own words, he's \"a surprisingly good pool player\" \u2013 and, Jodi Kantor reports, \"his idea of birthday relaxation is competing in an Olympic-style athletic tournament with friends, keeping close score\". Shall we call off this joyless campaign, and have the candidates settle things by triathlon instead?</p> <p>\u2022 The presidential candidates only, that is. Not the vice-presidential candidates. Paul Ryan would <a href=\"http://www.paulryantimecalculator.com/\">claim far better results</a> than he really obtained, and nobody wants to see Joe Biden in swimming trunks.</p>",
  "<p>The odds against an Israeli military strike on Iran in the next few months appear to be lengthening, and perhaps the strongest evidence comes from none other than Binyamin Netanyahu, the man who has beaten the war drums loudest over the past few months. </p> <p>By calling for<a href=\"http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4276757,00.html\"> clear international (read US) 'red lines'</a> containing Iran's nuclear programme, the Israeli prime minister has put the focus back on diplomacy, and given himself a ladder to climb down from his earlier rhetoric.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Ehud Barak, the defence minister who had claimed that Iran was approaching a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/29/magazine/will-israel-attack-iran.html?pagewanted=all\">'zone of immunity'</a> beyond which it could not be stopped, is now reported to be <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/the-barak-livni-axis.premium-1.462096#.UEYkt0aRCqQ.twitter\">against an Israeli attack (\u00a3)</a> before the coming US presidential elections.</p> <p>Consequently, Mike Rogers, the head of the US House intelligence committee returned from a visit to Israel with the conviction that Israel <a href=\"http://thehill.com/conventions-2012/gop-convention-tampa/246087-intel-chairman-israel-waiting-until-after-us-election-for-iran-strike\">will not launch an attack</a> before the US vote in November. According to The Hill online, the Republican congressman said the Israeli threat had lifted for now, \"because I think they believe that maybe after the election they could talk the United States into cooperating\".</p> <p>Such cooperation would be more likely in the event of a Mitt Romney victory in November, and with the poor state of the US economy, that seems increasingly possible. Netanyahu would look particularly foolish if he led Israel into a conflict on its own, just weeks before a close US ally came to power in Washington. The former CIA chief and current Romney adviser, Michael Hayden, was in Israel yesterday echoing the Obama administration message that <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/former-cia-chief-tells-haaretz-decision-on-iran-strike-can-wait.premium-1.462519\">military action can wait. </a></p> <p>Writing in Haaretz, the columnist Amos Harel, <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/in-the-iranian-poker-game-netanyahu-and-barak-have-overplayed-their-hand.premium-1.462525\">notes that Israel Hayom (\u00a3) </a>, owned by the American casino magnate and one of Romney's biggest backers, Sheldon Adelson, and which is widely viewed as a Netanyahu mouthpiece, has considerably toned down its coverage of Iran's nuclear programme in recent days. Harel's reading is that Netanyahu and Barak have overplayed their hand in poker terms, and have realised they have damaged Israel's relationship with the US for little or no strategic gain.</p> <p>David Remnick <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/09/03/120903fa_fact_remnick\">reports in the current edition (\u00a3) </a> of the New Yorker on the substantial lobby in the Israeli security and intelligence agencies who are opposed to unilateral Israeli action this year. The patron saint of the dissidents, the former Mossad chief, Meir Dagan, tells Remnick in a particularly striking passage: </p> <blockquote> <p>After 33 years in the military and intelligence...[y]ou discover it is possible to get dragged into something and then it is hard to explain why it all happened. It's easy to go from being a victim to being an oppressor. You always have to pay attention to your internal moral compass and ask the right questions. </p> </blockquote> <p>The background to all this is <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2012/sep/04/iaea-report-full-document\">the latest report</a> from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on the Iranian programme which failed to provide an unambiguous springboard for urgent action. It showed relentless progress, with a rough doubling of the number of centrifuges installed at Fordow, a heavily-protected site dug into the side of a mountain, and the main focus of Israeli and western concern. But the new centrifuges have not been turned on. The number of machines actually producing 20%-enriched uranium (critical because it can relatively easily be turned into weapons grade material) at Fordow has remained constant.</p> <p>And although IAEA reported that Iran has so far produced near 190 kg of 20%-enriched uranium, (theoretically enough for a warhead if it was further enriched) it has used 71 kg of that total for the production of reactor fuel plates, which are harder to turn into weapons-grade fuel.</p> <p>As Shashank Joshi <a href=\"http://www.rusi.org/go.php?structureID=commentary&amp;ref=C5044947B3D809#.UEYFn79y9E4\">argues in an analysis </a>for the Royal United Service Institute, it is questionable whether Barak's 'zone of immunity' idea made much sense in the first place. Fordow is under IAEA safeguards monitoring, so any attempt to \"break out\" and enrich to weapons grade would be flagged in advance. As there is no sign that Fordow is being fortified any further, the immunity of the programme does not seem to change. The 'zone of immunity' concept, Joshi says, should be 'understood primarily as a rhetorical device', and that rhetoric - this week at least - is sounding increasingly hollow.</p>",

We will preserve for our children this last best hope of man on earth, or we will sentence them to take the first step into a thousand years of darkness. If we fail, at least let our children and our children's children say of us we justified our brief moment here. We did all that could be done.</p> </blockquote> <p>The couple says that in the 2008 election, 30 million evangelical Christians stayed home on voting day, allowing Obama to win the election by 10m votes. To prevent that from happening again, they encourage evangelical voters to \"unite for god and country\" and vote this November.</p>",
  "<p>The contrast between the Democrats and Republicans couldn't be sharper when comparing the policy platforms adopted by the two parties at their respective national conventions. But the more revealing comparison is between the <a href=\"http://www.democrats.org/democratic-national-platform\">Democratic party platform of 2012</a> and its 2008 edition.</p> <p>Between the two parties this year, gay marriage, abortion, comprehensive immigration reform, healthcare and welfare spending all offer clear and distinct policy differences. In each case the Democrats are in favour and the Republicans are against.</p> <p>Although the official party platforms carry no real weight, with candidates free to adopt or discard them as they see fit, they do highlight one important point: while the Republican platform differs from that of the official Romney/Ryan ticket positions in a number of places, most notably on abortion, it would be hard to insert a \"Obama-Biden 2012\" bumper sticker between the Democratic platform and the presidential ticket.</p> <p>Aside from the political potshots the Democratic platform aims at Mitt Romney, the most significant new language is in its ringing endorsement of gay marriage, which largely aligns with Barack Obama's own recently changed stance. The 2012 platform reads:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We support marriage equality and support the movement to secure equal treatment under law for same-sex couples \u2026 We oppose discriminatory federal and state constitutional amendments and other attempts to deny equal protection of the laws to committed same-sex couples who seek the same respect and responsibilities as other married couples.</p> <p>We support the full repeal of the so-called Defense of Marriage Act [Doma] and the passage of the Respect for Marriage Act.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=78283\">That's a shift from the 2008 platform</a>, which skated over the issue with vague language of supporting \"equal responsibility, benefits, and protections\".</p> <p>Under the Obama administration, the department of justice has stopped defending Doma, but there have been no moves towards repealing it. That's unlikely to change soon, barring a dramatic change in the make-up of the House of Representatives.</p> <p>But the 2012 and 2008 editions differ most markedly over national security and civil liberties, especially the closure of the notorious US prison site at Guantanamo Bay; overturning the post 9/11 anti-terrorism laws such as the Patriot Act and trying alleged terrorists through domestic US courts. In 2008 the Democratic party unequivocally stated:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We will not ship away prisoners in the dead of night to be tortured in far-off countries, or detain without trial or charge prisoners who can and should be brought to justice for their crimes, or maintain a network of secret prisons to jail people beyond the reach of the law.</p> <p>We will respect the time-honored principle of habeas corpus, the seven century-old right of individuals to challenge the terms of their own detention that was recently reaffirmed by our supreme court.</p> <p>We will close the detention camp in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, the location of so many of the worst constitutional abuses in recent years.</p> </blockquote> <p>After struggling and failing to meet his own deadline to close Guant\u00e1namo and move terrorism trials to the mainland, and now influenced perhaps by the unhappy realities of being in office, Obama's policy as laid out in the 2012 platform speaks in measured tones of \"checks and balances\":</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Advancing our interests may involve new actions and policies to confront threats like terrorism, but the president and the Democratic party believe these practices must always be in line with our Constitution, preserve our people's privacy and civil liberties, and withstand the checks and balances that have served us so well. That is why the president banned torture without exception in his first week in office. That is why we are reforming military commissions to bring them in line with the rule of law. That is why we are substantially reducing the population at Guant\u00e1namo Bay without adding to it.</p> <p>And we remain committed to working with all branches of government to close the prison altogether because it is inconsistent with our national security interests and our values.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2012/09/democratic-platform-again-seeks-guantanamo-closure-134261.html\">Politico's Josh Gerstein points out</a> that \"aside from the non-specific mention of 'new actions and policies' related to terrorism, there's no explicit reference in the new platform to Obama's dramatically ramped up use of drone strikes to kill suspected terrorists\".</p> <p>On Afghanistan, the 2008 platform's bold talk of educating Afghan girls and rebuilding the country's economy \"from the bottom up\" has disappeared, replaced in the 2012 platform by grim, pragmatic language of reversing the Taliban's momentum and giving Afghans \"the time and space to build the capacity of their security forces\" while preparing for the withdrawal of US forces by 2014.</p> <p>The 2012 platform also responds aggressively to a new threat: the Citizens United supreme court ruling that opened a gusher of untrammeled money into American politics. \"We support campaign finance reform, by constitutional amendment if necessary,\" is the platform position, one that President Obama announced last week.</p> <p>In all, the 2012 Democratic platform is recognisably related to its predecessor but, like the campaign it represents, it is indelibly stamped with the political pragmatism and rolled-back rhetoric of the Obama administration's four years in office.</p>",

  "<p>America's big automakers enjoyed bumper sales in August as US consumers snapped up new cars and gave a boost to President Barack Obama's bailout of the industry.</p> <p>GM sold 240,520 new vehicles last month, its highest figure for the year and 10% higher than in August last year. Chrysler's sales rose 14% compared to August 2011 to 148,472, its best August sales figure since 2007.</p> <p>Both companies were bailed out by the Obama administration and forced into bankruptcy. That bailout has become a central plank of Obama's re-election campaign and has been attacked by his Republican Mitt Romney as \"crony capitalism\".</p> <p>Ford, the only major US car firm not to enter bankruptcy, reported a sales increase of 13% to 197,249 vehicles as drivers bought smaller cars.</p> <p>The sales figures come as Obama is expected to champion his auto bailout at this week's Democratic convention. GM's results contained another fillip for the president: a new sales record for its controversial Chevy Volt.</p> <p>The plug-in hybrid electric car has proven a politically charged vehicle with the government accused of meddling in GM's affairs in order to get the car built, charges senior GM officials have denied.</p> <p>The car been attacked on a number of occasions by Mitt Romney who has called it \"an idea whose time has not come\". In February Obama said he intended to buy a Volt when he leaves office.</p> <p>GM sold 2,831 Volts last month, its best sales ever. The sales came as overall sales at Chevrolet jumped 25%.</p> <p>Michelle Krebs, auto-industry analyst at Edmunds.com said pent-up demand for cars and easier access to credit were driving sales up and were likely to continue to do so.</p> <p>\"The average car on the road is now over 10 years old, that's a record number,\" she said. \"We are on track to sell 14.4m cars this year; there's an awful lot of pent up demand.\"</p> <p>She said the figures were \"good news for Detroit and good news for Obama. Clearly GM and Chrysler wouldn't have been around if it hadn't been for the bailout\".</p>",

  "<p>What if members of the United States Congress, now returning from their summer recess, were to receive a \"back to school\" letter from concerned citizens? Here is what a first draft might look like.</p> <h2>Dear Member of Congress:</h2> <p>Welcome back to the Capitol. We hope that you had a good summer break, and that you return to Washington not just rested, but also energised to take on our country's mounting economic challenges.</p> <p>The news has been mixed during your absence. We have seen some improvement in economic data, but not enough to suggest that we are any closer to overcoming decisively this painful period of low growth and high unemployment. And, with a self-inflicted fiscal cliff looming \u2013 one that could send our country back into recession, pulling the rest of the world with us \u2013 businesses are reluctant to hire and invest in new capital goods. Fortunately, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/31/markets-fed-chairman-ben-bernanke?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">Federal Reserve has signalled its intention to remain active</a>, but its policy tools are poorly suited to the challenges that we face.</p> <p>Meanwhile, global difficulties remain substantial. We continue to face strong headwinds originating from the deepening European debt crisis, as well as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. China, once the world's unstoppable growth engine, is slowing. And, despite all the happy talk, multilateral policy co-ordination is essentially non-existent.</p> <p>All of this calls for courageous and visionary economic leadership; otherwise, our problems will fester and grow, and the solutions will become even more complex. Already, too many of our economy's difficulties, including worrisome trends in youth joblessness and long-term unemployment, risk becoming structurally embedded.</p> <p>No doubt you have also noticed that, with less than 10 weeks to go until the November presidential election, our country is in the grip of an increasingly ugly political campaign. So, with this combination of bad economics and bad politics, we look to you for direction and leadership. It is that simple, and that important.</p> <p>We need you to overcome a prolonged period of congressional paralysis and polarisation in order to address the country's malaise. We need you to pivot in your responses from the tactical to the strategic, from the cyclical to the secular, from the partial to the comprehensive, and from sequential to simultaneous reforms.</p> <p>If this call to national duty is not enough, we would remind you of your own self-interest. According to the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, your support among us, the electorate, stands at just 12%.</p> <p>We concede that there is no magic wand to overcome our country's problems. After all, for too many years leading up to the global financial crisis, America \"bought\" and \"borrowed\" its growth by leveraging balance sheets, rather than \"earning\" it through increased competitiveness. The result was massive misallocation of human resources, insufficient infrastructure investment, over-reliance on credit entitlements, and, of course, unsustainable debt. To make matters worse, this occurred at a time when systemically important emerging economies hit their \"developmental breakout phase,\" powered by trade and other aspects of globalisation.</p> <p>We do not expect you to solve America's problems overnight. Instead, we look to you to embark on an appropriate and sustainable policy path. So, as you unpack your bags and renew old friendships and rivalries, please keep the following in mind.</p> <p>Changing course requires that you, together with the president, have a much more open and consistent economic dialogue with us, the general public, about the challenges that we face. It also requires that you and the president converge on a multi-prong, multi-year policy initiative that, at a minimum, makes simultaneous advances in six critical areas:</p> <p>\u2022 Fiscal reform: We desperately need you to eliminate the looming fiscal cliff in the context of medium-term reforms of both the tax system and entitlements. This would also allow for greater fiscal stimulus at a time when other components of aggregate demand are slowing.</p> <p>\u2022 Labour-market reform: Persistently high unemployment and large-scale withdrawal from the labour force are a constant reminder of a malfunctioning labour market that needs support through better training and retooling. Reform must also address the related challenges of a lagging education system and an insufficient social safety net.</p> <p>\u2022 Housing and housing finance: At the root of the global financial crisis, the troubled US housing market continues to act as a millstone around the economy's neck. The longer the problems persist, the greater the pressure on consumer and business sentiment, and the harder it is for the unemployed to find and relocate to new job opportunities.</p> <p>\u2022 Clogged credit pipes: With banks' balance sheets contracting, too many small and medium-size companies are unable to mobilise credit for investment and growth. Recognising that it will take years until banks are properly stabilised, America needs to build new conduits for credit.</p> <p>\u2022 Infrastructure: Those of you who have travelled abroad know that our infrastructure is desperately lagging that of a growing number of countries. This makes it even harder for our companies to compete and prosper.</p> <p>\u2022 Global policy co-ordination: America's traditional leadership role has evaporated in recent years as our problems have made us more insular and inward-looking. This would not be a major problem if the resulting vacuum had been filled. But that has not happened. On the contrary, the G7 has lost relevance, the International Monetary Fund is hampered by its representation and legitimacy deficits, and the G20 is still finding its feet.</p> <p>Engineering such an agenda is not an overwhelming challenge. But that will provide little comfort if you, our elected representatives, do not collaborate effectively.</p> <p>The choice Congress faces this term is simple: either address head on America's challenges, or risk being remembered as the body whose dithering condemned future generations to being worse off than their parents.</p> <p>Yours sincerely,</p> <p>Concerned citizens</p> <p>__________________________________________________________</p> <p>Copyright: <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/\" title=\"\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2012</p>",
  "<p>President Barack Obama will meet local officials in Louisiana on Monday to assess the \"ongoing response and recovery efforts\" after the damage caused by hurricane Isaac.</p> <p>The trip, part of a four day cross-country tour leading up to the Democratic national convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, comes as Louisiana continues to battle floodwater and power outages.</p> <p>It was estimated that about 200,000 people were still without electricity.</p> <p>Meanwhile, five days after the hurricane struck land, thousands of residents remained in evacuee shelters or were with friends and relatives, waiting for the all clear to go home.</p> <p>At least seven people are thought to have died in the US as a result of the hurricane \u2013 five in Louisiana and two in Mississippi \u2013 and thousands were displaced. The number of people registered at Red Cross and community shelters was put at 2,800 people, down from an earlier estimate of 4,000.</p> <p>Many of those caught up in the latest evacuation remain fearful of what awaits them at home.</p> <p>\"This is the second time we've lost our home. We lost it in Katrina,\" said Angela Serpas, from severely flooded Braithwaite in Plaquemines parish.</p> <p>Serpas and her daughter are currently staying with in-laws while waiting for the green light to go back home.</p> <p>In other parts of the state affected by Isaac, life is beginning to return to normal. Offshore oil rig workers returned to platforms and drilling rigs over the weekend.</p> <p>And although large residential pockets remain without power, lines have been restored to hundreds of thousands of homes.</p> <p>In New Orleans, the annual Southern Decadence festival \u2013 a gay pride celebration \u2013 went ahead over the weekend as planned. In Baton Rouge, thousands of gamblers gathered for the opening of Louisiana's newest riverboat casino \u2013 delayed by three days by the hurricane.</p> <p>But other parts of the flood-hit state remained under water. Much of Plaquemines parish, a vulnerable finger of land that juts into the Gulf of Mexico, continued to struggled to disperse as much as five feet of floodwater.</p> <p>\"I've never seen water come up this quick this fast,\" Parish president Billy Nungesser said.</p> <p>Nonetheless, local business owners and residents will be allowed to return temporarily with police escorts on Monday.</p> <p>In Saint John the Baptist parish, authorities are still eyeing the threat from high river levels. Over the weekend, evacuation buses and about 150 national guard soldiers were sent to the parish in case stranded residents needed assistance.</p> <p>President Obama will deliver remarks from Saint John the Baptist Parish later on Monday after seeing firsthand the post-hurricane clean-up operation.</p> <p>Mitt Romney visited the state Friday. In 2005, president George Bush was fiercely criticised for his slow response to Katrina, a hurricane that killed 1,800 people. In the immediate aftermath of the destruction, Bush opted to observe the damage from Air Force One, rather than setting foot on the ground.</p> <p>With an election just around the corner, neither Romney nor Obama were willing to make the same mistake.</p>",
  "<p>What is it about electronic components group <strong>Premier Farnell</strong> that its directors seem so attractive to leisure groups?</p> <p><strong>Whitbread</strong>, the hotels, pubs and Costa Coffee group, has poached Nicholas Cadbury from Premier Farnell to be its new finance director. Cadbury replaces Christopher Rogers, who has become managing director of Costa, a move which rekindled City speculation that the coffee shop business could ultimately be demerged from Whitbread.</p> <p>As well as working at Premier Farnell, Cadbury also spent three years working at Dixons Retail, including holding the finance director job.</p> <p>Shares in Whitbread - which is due to issue a trading up date on Thursday - have edged 1p lower to \u00a321.25. Ian Rennardson at Jefferies said:</p> <blockquote> Hampered by relatively difficult comparisons, we expect Whitbread to report flattish second quarter like for like sales against the 4.5% achieved in the first quarter. We continue to think that the underlying growth at Whitbread looks to be fairly valued. We leave our forecasts, which are in-line with consensus, unchanged and reiterate our hold recommendation with a maintained 1770p price target. <br> </blockquote> <p>Premier Farnell, which in May saw chief executive Harriet Green quit to join tour operator Thomas Cook, is down 2.4p at 190.6p.</p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> has fallen 25.17 points to 5723.24 as investors turned cautious ahead of Thursday's key European Central Bank meeting, where president Mario Draghi is set to spell out more details of a proposed bond buying programme. News that ratings agency Moody's had changed its outlook on the European Union to negative puts more pressure on the ECB to act. Meanwhile analysts will also be keeping an eye out for US manufacturing data due out later.</p> <p>Among the fallers <strong>Land Securities</strong> has lost 14p to 779.5p after UBS cut its rating on the property group from buy to neutral, with a reduced 840p target price, while JP Morgan Cazenove moved from overweight to neutral.</p> <p><strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> is 4.8p lower at 221.7p. Ian Gordon at Investec has downgraded from buy to hold, saying:</p> <blockquote> The Labour Party adopted D:Ream's hit, \"Things can only get better\" as its campaign tune for the 1997 general election, but it heralded a false dawn. Investors in RBS have had too many false dawns \u2013 \"underlying\" operating profits performing broadly \"in line with expectations\" but continuing to be dwarfed by material negative one-off items, of which there are still more coming down the pipe. Reducing Non-Core drag softens the blow, but after another modest rally, we throw in the towel. Downgrade to hold. <br> In absolute terms, it remains speculative, and while it still appears moderately cheap as a long-term recovery play, we expect to see better entry levels emerge. </blockquote>",
