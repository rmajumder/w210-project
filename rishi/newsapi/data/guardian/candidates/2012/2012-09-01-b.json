  "<p>Attention, Tory MPs and reactionaries of every stripe! You thought you hated the Olympic opening ceremony? Then brace yourselves for the arrival of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00y08rk\" title=\"\"><em>The People's Songs</em></a> on Radio 2 (yes, that's state-funded radio), in which flop-fringed fop Stuart Maconie will construct a history of modern Britain through 50 popular (though not always pop) songs. So far, so list-culture inoffensive, right?</p> <p>Well, kind of: except the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/9509040/Do-these-10-songs-represent-modern-Britain.html\" title=\"\">first 10</a>, revealed ahead of the series, to be broadcast in January, might ruffle the feathers of those on the hunt for more Boyle-inspired \"leftie multicultural crap\". Not We'll Meet Again, obviously, nor probably even She Loves You, which Maconie describes as an embodiment of post-austerity dynamism.</p> <p>But <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCUcbRTB6Rs\" title=\"\">Millie Small</a>'s My Boy Lollipop, the first ska song to become a smash hit? <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3Fa4lOQfbA\" title=\"\">Je T'Aime... Moi Non Plus</a>, with its Frenchified naughtiness? That's before we even get to the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtUH2YSFlVU\" title=\"\">Sex Pistols and God Save the Queen</a> or the Shamen's house classic <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFJdUJg4wOk\" title=\"\">Ebeneezer Goode</a>, once banned by the BBC and now feted by its most traditionally conservative radio station.</p> <p>(Will Maconie reflect on the lyric \"Has anybody got any veras?\", a request for cigarette papers derived from slang that rhymes the aforementioned \"Vera Lynn\" with \"skin\"? Your call, Stuart: I just think it would make a nice little link.)</p> <p>Sit in a room reading a book and the book takes you somewhere else. Play a song and the song becomes the room, or the street, or the riot. This is not to play one art form off against another, but to point out that the ambient nature of music, its ability to permeate and saturate, means that it will always provide us with a way to talk about politics, history and culture, even \u2013 and perhaps especially \u2013 when they don't overtly constitute its subject matter.</p> <p>The programme's title, coupled with Maconie's appeal for listeners to get in touch with their personal stories and memories, lets you know that this is unlikely to be one for musicological purists; its presenter has already conceded that the featured songs aren't necessarily going to be \"the greatest records ever made\", adding that what he didn't want to make was \"another one of those how <em>Pet Sounds </em>or <em>Sgt Pepper </em>was recorded\" shows.</p> <p>Fine: there are enough of those, although listeners might draw the line at the inclusion of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7aPp-4z-uw\" title=\"\">Y Viva Espa\u00f1a </a>simply to illustrate the cultural impact of the package holiday.</p> <p>But what programmes such as these can show is the extent to which music moulds society as well as forming its soundtrack. One of the first tranche of songs named is Lonnie Donegan's version of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_aIQ1_sAVg\" title=\"\">Rock Island Line</a>, an American folk song that transferred easily into the 1950s skiffle boom; from Arkansas prisoners to British teenagers mimicking Donegan with one-string basses fashioned from tea chests and broom handles. And what it should also demonstrate is that the diversity of popular culture is the glue that holds us together.</p> <p>From Y Viva Espa\u00f1a to Frankie Goes to Hollywood's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTOQUnvI3CA\" title=\"\">Two Tribes</a> \u2013 neither of which would feature among my Desert Island Discs \u2013 popular music has continually morphed and mutated; often we forget that what now seems mainstream was once new and shocking.</p> <p>At its best, what drives the form is ingenuity and restless recombination, something that a musician such as Damon Albarn, flitting between genres and countries and cultures, has understood only too well. At its worst, it is tired and lazy and derivative, perhaps best summed up by a friend who described the Olympic closing ceremony as \"a depressing old dome-era shitbag of pop\".</p> <p>It should be like a circus. Let's hope that Albarn proves to be the ringmaster and the likes of Simon Cowell the novelty act.</p> <h2>Dear readers, an apology: I might've misread Joey Barton</h2> <p>The transfer deadline, which came and went last Friday night with the usual febrile mixture of rumour, rapture and recrimination \u2013 all of which emotions are swiftly succeeded by a terrible sense of anti-climax \u2013 saw the departure from these shores of one Joey Barton.</p> <p>As he headed for Olympique de Marseille, tweeting his excitement and relief along the way, it was tempting to imagine him mouthing Malvolio's lines when he quits the stage: \"I'll be revenged on the whole pack of you.\"</p> <p>Like I said, it's a febrile time, but Joey B really does have me in a bind. Ever since I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/apr/14/joey-barton-interview\" title=\"\">interviewed</a> him for this newspaper earlier in the year, I've followed his progress with interest \u2013 and, on occasion, not a little alarm. When I met Barton, I liked him a lot; he was warm, thoughtful, funny and \u2013 especially in light of the hoops you'd have to jump through to get anywhere near most Premier League players \u2013 accessible.</p> <p>I wrote about how he'd tried to rout his demons, about how he was coming to terms with his frailties. I also wrote about the snobbery with which people reacted to the sight of a man, born working class, going to an art gallery or reading a book.</p> <p>I'll be truthful: I hoped that he'd stay out of trouble. I didn't really want him to get sent off on the last day of the season and get a <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">12-match ban for violent conduct </a>that heralded the beginning of the end of his career at QPR.</p> <p>I didn't want to see him on Twitter railing at the club for making him train, as he diplomatically put it, \"with the kids and fellow Taliban members\". Oh, Joey! I still like you, but you do make it hard sometimes. At the moment, there appears to be a truce in the air, with the ink drying on the transfer paperwork and conciliatory tweets; and today sees Barton turning 30 and the possible dawning of a new age of maturity. So, let us just say, bon voyage, bonne chance and please, please, try to keep hors de combat.</p> <h2>Can the Man With No Name save the Man With No Shame?</h2> <p>You can see what the idea was. In theory and on a good day, the guest speaker at the Republican convention might have delivered a lot of bang for your buck. Let's think it through one more time: you get the actor who most voters regard as the perfect embodiment of traditional American values. In the popular imagination, not only is he the scourge of bad guys at home and abroad, the cleaner-upper of crime-ridden cities and corrupt western towns, he's also been seen as an actual presidential bodyguard. What Mitt Romney needed to remember was that <em>In the Line of Fire</em> is a fiction and that entertainers are notoriously difficult to corral.</p> <p>At least <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19434705\" title=\"\">Clint Eastwood </a>only chatted amiably, albeit bafflingly, to an empty chair. Let's not forget that, at the 1983 Young Conservatives conference, wild-eyed fun machine Kenny Everett urged the party faithful to bomb Russia and kick away Michael Foot's stick. (Incidentally, you're at liberty to have who you like once you've won: witness Bill Clinton spicing up the 53rd inaugural ball with Mikhail Baryshnikov and Kenny G.)</p> <p>Romney must have hoped that Eastwood would function as, essentially, a walking manifesto. Added to which, he is what the presidential hopeful aspires to be \u2013 politically successful, determinedly his own man and beloved of the nation. What he forgot is that the jazz-loving, history-challenging (<em>Letters From Iwo Jima</em>, anyone?), transcendental-meditating Eastwood is, above all, an artist. And they, my friends, are simply not to be trusted.</p>",
  "<p>After a few weeks in which Amazon customers have transformed the shopping site into the go-to venue for competitive, gender-related comedy, Bic will be aware that the modern world is no place for a special lady's pen. Specifically, online satirists have vied, so inventively, to express disdain for its pastel <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/30/bic-pen-for-her-amazon-reviews_n_1842991.html\" title=\"\">Bic for Her</a> retractable ballpoints with a \"slimmer barrel designed to fit more comfortably in women's hands\", that the quality of pen jokes, in the shape of fake customer reviews, outshines anything recently reported from the Edinburgh fringe festival, including its winning one-liner: \"You know who really gives kids a bad name? Posh and Becks\".</p> <p>Compare this top-rated Bic for Her review: \"I bought this pen (in error, evidently) to write my reports of each day's tree-felling activities in my job as a lumberjack. It is no good. It slips from between my calloused, gnarly fingers like a gossamer thread gently descending to Earth between two giant redwood trunks.\" Another reviewer takes a different view: \"I tried these on a whim and I have to say I wasn't very impressed. The applicator mechanism is much too fiddly and the plastic tampon inside far too thin...\"</p> <p>The title of my favourite Bic for Her review, discovered, you may imagine, after numberless hours of back-breaking investigation, would actually work as a one-liner: These Made Me Gay. \"Don't let these monstrosities into your workplace,\" the reviewer continues, \"or you will become an abomination as I have! Damn you, Bic! You are advancing the Gay Agenda, knowingly or not!\"</p> <p>Following decades of misery caused by plastic pens destined (once their cristal \u2030 housing and iconic streamlined cap have parted company) to leak all over the lining of a lady's bag, perhaps it is natural if many women now conclude that, even in the ballpoint world, what goes around comes around. If, as a woman judge said last week, the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2194963/Female-judge-Zoe-Smith-warns-bag-snatcher.html\" title=\"\">theft of a bag</a> is up there, pretty much, with the extinction of her entire personality, then an indelible bag stain must come a close second.</p> <p>And yet anyone who believes that the scheme of karmic inevitability still leaves a role for human mercy might want to examine the mitigating circumstances surrounding Bic for Her. Consider the context: an Amazon site in which sales of ladies' gardening essentials, ladies' running shoes and ladies' face creams, to name just a few gratuitously gendered and often superfluously pastel and flowery items, continues unmolested by satirists.</p> <p>Admittedly, the relevant manufacturers have probably avoided making asinine design claims that imply a disabling female weakness and have thus escaped the extremes of online sarcasm. That aside, is there anything culpably Bic about offering gendered products that either appeal or, if you will, condescend, to adult women through the use of shapes, colours and notions that are demonstrably culturally understood to be feminine, thus making them popular with some, but not all, female customers?</p> <p>Pink phones, for example. Pink car insurance branding. Pink bibles for female religious believers. As for pens, the company might argue, what, other than product description, makes its cheap pastel ballpoints any more absurd than Mont Blanc's Ingrid Bergman La Donna ballpoint from its Diva range, \"coated with a mother-of-pearl style lacquer, decorated with Ingrid Bergman's signature. Red gold-plated clip set with a royal-purple amethyst\".</p> <p>If it is Bic's clumsy \"for her\" designation that arouses such sustained mockery, along with the \"designed to fit more comfortably\" allusions to allegedly female needs, then the warm reaction to the US Republican party's new \"for her\" political message, specially designed to fit in women's hearts, should reassure the company that its own, significantly less demeaning sales pitch will one day be forgotten.</p> <p>Outside the world of Amazon satirists, as Ann Romney has demonstrated, many people are delighted to listen to a gendered politics that portrays women as emotional spectators of the party scene, susceptible only to dimwitted, \"for her\" appeals relating to love, motherhood, Welsh cakes and visceral lady feelings. Or as Mrs Romney put it: \"If you listen carefully, you'll hear the women sighing a little bit more than the men. It's how it is, isn't it? It's the moms who always have to work a little harder, to make everything right\".</p> <p>For this, and much Bic-plus rambling about the female condition \u2013 \"I'm not sure if the men really understand this, but I don't think there's a woman in America who expects her life to be easy!\" \u2013 Ann Romney has been hailed as the inspired, super-normal saviour of her husband, whose peerless lady-escorting abilities had previously gone unacknowledged in the commotion about abortion, contraception and rape.</p> <p>\"<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-19406822\" title=\"\">He will take us to a better place</a>,\" Mrs Romney told Americans, alluding to some key romantic reminiscence, \"just as he took me home safely from that dance.\" Could Michelle, women will want to know, say the same for Obama? Forget abortions and the economy: did he watch her safely in through her father's front door after that unforgettable night, and then stare fixedly at the house until the light died in her window behind a pair of fluttering pink curtains? Or was Obama the kind of brute who would heedlessly push a girl into an unlicensed minicab without checking if she has the outrageous fare that will certainly be extorted by its leche rous, illegal alien driver?</p> <p>Anyway, if Ann Romney had been a ballpoint on Amazon, she would have been flamed by now. Damn You, Ann! First, I start sighing competitively and now I find that voting with my heart has turned me gay! Instead, the preposterous lady rhetoric has inspired extravagant praise, even among her party's natural critics. The <em>Boston Globe </em>said hers was \"the best convention speech by any candidate's spouse \u2013 and certainly the most important\".</p> <p>The obvious question, with British conferences coming up is: could it happen here? Although Mrs Cameron is generally kept busy designing pink bibles and notebooks with OMG on the front, that there is no depth guaranteed unplumbable by a loyal political wife has previously been demonstrated by Cherie Blair, introduced to voters as a \"keen knitter\", and by Sarah Brown, extolling the goodness of Gordon, her \"hero\". Mrs Cameron confided, equally objectively, that Dave has \"never let me down\" (albeit that was before the Rebekah lolz). If this drivel rarely gets the kind of savaging it deserves it's possibly because the language, however cringe-inducing, is so personal.</p> <p>Maybe Mrs Brown genuinely thinks we'd like, as women, to replace her in the Kirkcaldy bedroom, watching while Mr Brown wakes up \"thinking about the things that matter\". President Obama wakes up, Michelle says, all \"snore-y and stinky\". Mr Romney, halitosis levels unrecorded, \"will wake up every day\", says Mrs R, \"with the determination to solve the problems that others say can't be solved\". Fine. But are any of these politicians proven to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles?</p>",
  "<p>Just over two months ago, the small Dutch community of Almelo woke up to a tragedy that turned out to have national repercussions. On a modest street in a rundown area, Aziz Kara, a 64-year-old Turk, became embroiled in a ferocious argument with his neighbours. When he was struck to the ground, the impact of the blow put him into a coma. Ten days later Kara died of a brain haemorrhage.</p> <p>In normal circumstances, the death would have preoccupied only the local media. But as the Netherlands prepares for its second national election in two years, Kara's case was different. When relatives and the local community organised a silent march through the streets of Almelo, politicians and mourners came from The Hague and across the country. National newspaper columns were devoted to the incident, which quickly became a PR disaster for arguably the most influential far-right politician in the European Union, Geert Wilders.</p> <p>To Wilders's acute discomfort, the man who allegedly beat Kara to the ground was called Henk. And his wife \u2013 who apparently shouted racist abuse at the victim on the ground \u2013 was called Ingrid. The resonance of the names was lost on no one. In the last two years, the Netherlands has learned to live with another \"Henk and Ingrid\" \u2013 a fictional couple born of Wilders's own populist imagination. Just as Basildon man and Worcester woman became stars of elections in Britain, Wilders's blue-collar caricatures were successfully deployed to voice the anti-immigrant, anti-Islam sentiments of his Freedom party (PVV). \"Henk and Ingrid are sick of paying for Ali and Fatima,\" went one anti-immigrant slogan.</p> <p>After Kara's death that didn't sound so good. \"Henk and Ingrid are real,\" tweeted one TV personality. \"And they just killed someone in Almelo.\"</p> <p>Wilders has since dropped all reference to Henk and Ingrid. But the backlash against the PVV after the killing indicated that its culture war with Islam is no longer making the political weather in Holland. Wilders, the divisive, charismatic showman of national politics, is projected to take only 18 of the 150 available parliamentary seats on 12&#xa0;September, well down from 24 two years ago.</p> <p>\"Those Wilders cultural themes are not dominating the public debate,\" said Chris Aalberts, a cultural historian at Erasmus University in Rotterdam. \"The big election issues right now are economic \u2013 health, social security \u2026 and Europe\".</p> <p>It is a change that could have huge consequences for the eurozone's political landscape at a delicate moment. For control of the Oranje zeitgeist has not returned to the handful of mainstream national parties which traditionally form coalitions in the Hague. Instead, as austerity bites hard even in this prosperous northern bastion of the eurozone, the newest political insurgency to sweep the Netherlands is coming from the radical left.</p> <p>The Dutch Socialist party (SP) is an organisation once known for its Maoist sympathies and habit of throwing tomatoes at political opponents. It now finds itself within touching distance of becoming the biggest parliamentary force, eclipsing its more moderate rivals in the Labour party and on course to gain at least 30 parliamentary seats. Just as the unexpected success of the leftwing Syriza party in beleaguered Greece set alarm bells ringing in Brussels, the SP has become another surprise package of European politics at a time when more centrist politicians seem to lack ideas.</p> <p>While Wilders's party made its name through divisive ideas such as a tax on Muslim headscarves, a favourite SP slogan reads: \"There's enough to go round for everyone.\" But that inclusive message is intended to carry menacing implications for bankers, business and the EU powerbrokers of Brussels. Anti-austerity and exasperated by endless eurozone bailouts, the SP's leader, Emile Roemer, 50, has pledged to abandon the government's plan to bring the budget deficit below 3% by 2013, largely through healthcare cuts and wage freezes, and face down German chancellor Angela Merkel and the European commission if they object.</p> <p>Conservative plans to extend the retirement age from 65 to 67 would also be torn up. And in an echo of French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's intention to raise more money from the very rich, income tax would be raised from 52% to 65% on those earning above \u00a3119,000 a year. A public investment programme, partly financed by the proceeds, would be aimed at turning around the ailing Dutch economy.</p> <p>For an avuncular former teacher, known for a toothy smile and sometimes nicknamed \"Fozzie Bear\", it adds up to an uncompromising platform designed to cause palpitations in both the Amsterdam stock exchange and European commission corridors.</p> <p>On Europe, Roemer has still more to say. A eurozone banking union has been ruled out, as has the so-called European stability mechanism (ESM), which would allow fines to be imposed on countries refusing to maintain balanced budgets. There would be no more Dutch agreement to bailouts of Greece, or any other country.</p> <p>For a once-marginal party that used to stay out of parliamentary politics, this twin strategy \u2013 targeting cuts at home and bailouts abroad \u2013 has struck a deafening chord. The Netherlands no longer feels like a safe haven in the eurozone storm. In May, the European commission predicted that the economy would contract by nearly 1% this year. House prices are falling at an alarming rate and in July the rating agency Moody's publically contemplated a downgrade of the country's cherished triple A rating on government debt.</p> <p>Many voters have had enough. In one poll, some 70% expressed a preference for greater economic stimulus and fewer cuts in 2013. Another survey found that only 58% of Dutch people were now in favour of EU membership, compared with 76% in 2010, a drop that represents a major wobble in one of the founder members of the EU.</p> <p>Over a few months, the mild-mannered Roemer has transformed the political debate. Prime minister Mark Rutte has taken to warning that an SP-led government would imperil the country. \"The SP has the economic themes,\" said Aalberts. \"And the foreigners Dutch people are concerned with at the moment are Polish and Greek, not Muslim.\"</p> <p>There was ample evidence of that at the Wesselerbrink market in Enschede, where the SP was doing a thriving trade in symbolic foam \"protest\" tomatoes, handed out to passersby in one of the city's poorer areas. In this eastern city, which boasts a proud industrial heritage but has a highly uncertain future, the talk among the shoppers was of medical charges, money worries and the malign influence of Brussels bureaucrats and profligate Greeks.</p> <p>\"I worked until I was 43,\" said Kim Bozuwa, who needs a \"scootmobile\" to get around. \"Then I smashed my kneecap in a fall. I've also got diabetes. If the Conservatives win, I'm going to have to pay far more in payments for my medical care. Why? It's not as if I can choose whether to have the medication or not.\"</p> <p>Lillian, a pensioner who has lived in Enschede most of her life, was also contemplating a vote for the SP. \"I've already got a reduced pension thanks to the crisis,\" she said. \"I can't see why we should take orders from Brussels to cut our living standards. Half of the bureaucrats there do nothing that's any use to anyone and half are on the make. It's an elite mafia. And the Greeks lied to enter the eurozone. They altered their figures to make sure they got in.\"</p> <p>Wim Kooiker, a market regular, echoed her sentiments and went a step further. \"The Netherlands should get out of the EU. First it was Greece that needs the bailouts, then Spain, soon it will be Italy and then it will be France. We should get out and so should England!\"</p> <p>This month promises to be tumultuous for the eurozone. On the same day that the Dutch vote, a German constitutional court will rule on the legality of a formal rescue fund for euro members, amid mounting fears of a Greek exit. An anti-austerity uprising in the Netherlands would add to the sense that Europe's policymaking elite has lost its way.</p> <p>Could it happen? With no experience in national government, Roemer struggled in the opening televised debates. It is possible that even if the SP scores a resounding success at the polls, centrist parties will combine to ensure it is excluded from any coalition. But the message of the Dutch election campaign of 2012 is unmistakable. In yet another eurozone country, a huge disconnection has emerged between popular sentiment among voters and the policy consensus maintained by a beleaguered political elite.</p> <p>In Greece, Syriza and its leader, Alexis Tsipras, drew the benefit. In Italy, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/21/parma-mayor-pizzarotti-beppe-grillo\" title=\"\">a maverick comic named Beppe Grillo</a> has become the most popular political figure around. In Holland, a temptation to ditch austerity and go it alone is changing a political landscape dominated for 10 years by multiculturalism and race.</p> <p>As the owner of an engineering company in Enschede, Uulke Visser makes for an unusual SP activist. Unsurprisingly, he admits to a sense of excitement as an extraordinary campaign comes to a climax. \"This party stands for the opposite of 'what's in it for me?'. It's about investing in people and their prospects. Here in the Netherlands we have a group of people who are getting desperate. They're asking, 'Is this all we can expect?'. And they're thinking things will only get worse. It could yet be the biggest moment in the history of the Socialist party.\"</p>",
  "<p>After the traditional August lull, there is foreboding in Brussels and other European capitals about what lies ahead for the euro in the autumn. In what promises to be a momentous few weeks, the spotlight will fall first on Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, who is expected to unveil intervention moves in Frankfurt on Thursday aimed at capping borrowing costs for Spain and Italy and preventing the crisis spiralling out of control.</p> <p>Draghi faces the wrath of Germany's Bundesbank, which is withering about his plan to intervene in the secondary markets to buy up sovereign debt and prevent Rome's and Madrid's borrowing costs becoming unaffordable. Whether this will work is in doubt. Previous ECB interventions \u2013 buying Italian bonds last summer or flooding EU banks with cheap three-year loans \u2013 brought temporary respite for the currency, but no durable resolution.</p> <p>The Draghi proposals will also come hedged with caveats and conditions that will delay ECB action, in effect piling the pressure on the eurozone's political leaders to take the primary role in dealing with the crisis.</p> <p>A few days later, on 12 September, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the European commission president, will deliver his annual state of the union speech to the European parliament as Brussels tables a draft law on a radical new regime for supervising and regulating eurozone banks. This represents a quantum leap in the way the EU is run, for the first time putting the eurozone's banks \u2013 at issue is how many of them \u2013 under the authority of the ECB, a massive increase in the central bank's powers.</p> <p>The \"banking union\" is supposed to be the first step, followed by a fiscal union and ultimately a eurozone political union, in effect leading to a much more integrated eurozone political federation within a decade. This is roughly the German vision of where things are going or should go. The problems are immense. The arguments will be bitter.</p> <p>Also on 12 September, the election in the Netherlands will reveal the extent to which Euroscepticism has grown among the Dutch, while Germany's supreme court will rule whether the eurozone's new permanent \u20ac500bn bailout fund, the ESM, is compatible with German law. It was supposed to start operating in July.</p> <p>After this, the spotlight will turn to Greece and whether, following months of political paralysis, it is doing enough to meet the terms of its second bailout, whether it needs more money \u2013 in effect, a third bailout \u2013 and whether it is able to stay in the euro at all.</p> <p>The European fiscal and budgetary police force known as the \"troika\" \u2013 and to the Greeks as \"the men in black\" \u2013 will descend on Athens this week to go through the books amid pleas from the Greeks that they need more time, and therefore more money, to meet the debt and deficit reduction targets imposed as the price of the bailouts.</p> <p>There is little stomach across the eurozone for a third bailout, but there are also growing signs of nervousness at the impact a Greek exit from the euro would have.</p> <p>In under three years of euro crisis, there have been umpteen \"make-or-break\" and \"last-chance\" moments for the currency, usually resulting in muddling through, doing just enough to gain a little more time, delaying the denouement to the Greek and the broader European drama.</p> <p>How long that strategy can survive is anyone's guess, but the sense in Brussels is that the stakes are rising and between now and Christmas the euro's fate will probably be decided.</p> <p>The most tired clich\u00e9 in European affairs is the transport metaphor invariably used to describe the relationship between Berlin and Paris \u2013 the Franco-German \"motor, \"engine\", \"tandem\", \"axis\". It remains truer than ever, however, that there can be no durable fix to the crisis without an accommodation between Angela Merkel and the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.</p> <p>Since Hollande was elected in May, he has mounted one challenge after another to Merkel's authority, climaxing in June when he sided with Italy and Spain to defeat the Germans at an EU summit.</p> <p>Both sides acknowledged last week that things can't go on like this, agreeing to set up a high-powered working group to deliver common policies with both countries' finance ministers meeting fortnightly.</p> <p>The Germans and the French remain far apart on policy, on how to fix the crisis and on the overall political future of the EU and the eurozone.</p> <p>But the new arrangements will necessarily produce compromises for the long haul of gradually building a more integrated eurozone federation. First, however, the key leaders will need to navigate and survive what promises to be a very hot autumn.</p>",
  "<p>There were 15,000 journalists in Tampa covering Mitt Romney's coronation. But what did they do, apart from eat, fill out expenses claims and watch a pre-packed TV spectacle with even less primetime exposure than ever? Well, they could fact-check the wilder shores of GOP rhetoric (a great growth industry) but that still left 14,500 with not much to do. So why, if Gary Lineker and the two Alans can cover a European football championship in the Ukraine from Salford Quays, does anyone need to go near a conference hall again? Ask yourself that in Charlotte this week; or perhaps as the Lib Dems pack for Brighton.</p>",
  "<p>Each nugget of data about the health of the American housing market or the mood of its consumers will be eagerly seized upon and carefully spun by Barack Obama and Mitt Romney in the coming weeks, as they fight to prove they should be trusted to run the world's largest economy. The US has shrugged off the after-effects of the sub-prime downturn more effectively than the eurozone, and is certainly in ruder health than the stagnating UK, expanding at an annual rate of 1.7% according to <a href=\"http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/gdpnewsrelease.htm\" title=\"\">the latest numbers</a>.</p> <p>Yet the background music for what promises to be a closely fought presidential campaign is of a country less certain than for many years of its place in the world \u2013 hamstrung by public and private debt; anxious about the disappearance of traditional jobs to low-cost markets overseas; worn down by a prolonged period in which living standards for middle America have moved sideways. If the <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w18315\" title=\"\">latest analysis</a> by the US economist Robert Gordon is correct, America's voters have every reason to be concerned \u2013 not just about whether the economy can weather the slowdown in China and Europe over the next 12 months, but about its growth prospects for decades to come. At the centre of his argument in a provocative new paper, \"Is US Economic Growth Over?\", is the insight that the latest wave of hi-tech innovation sweeping out from the US west coast may be less of a boon than its cheerleaders hope.</p> <p>As Silicon Valley twentysomethings waltz off with mega-billions, it's tempting to conclude that the internet has wrought the most radical transformation of the economy in modern history; and as Apple's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/25/apple-samsung-patent-infringement-trial?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">big-bucks patent case</a> against Samsung made clear, the corporate profits to be made and lost in what used to be called the \"new economy\" are immense.</p> <p>But Gordon warns that the growth dividend from the latest wave of innovations has actually been far smaller than that from what he calls the second industrial revolution, in the 19th century. In fact, he believes that the seemingly relentless expansion of the American economy could be about to run into the sand. Industrial revolution one, from about 1750 to 1830, brought steam and railways, Gordon argues; number two, from 1870 to 1900, gave us flushing toilets, electric light, the internal combustion engine and the telegraph, among a host of other benefits; and number three, from the 1970s onwards, computers.</p> <p>Gordon does not deny that there have been productivity gains from computers \u2013 serried ranks of secretaries in typing pools and filing cabinets full of punch-cards have been rendered obsolete; we can organise our lives with a barrage of text messages in the time it once took to pen a single note.</p> <p>And he acknowledges that productivity growth did improve, to 2.5% a year between 1996 and 2004, from 1.4% in the previous 15&#xa0;years, as the benefits spread through companies and homes \u2013 but he argues that many of these were one-off changes, which cannot now be repeated. Instead of speeding up production lines and freeing workers for less menial tasks than typing or filing, he argues, today's major inventions are focused instead on ever more elaborate consumer gadgets. \"Attention in the past decade has focused not on labour-saving innovation, but rather on a succession of entertainment and communication devices that do the same things as we could do before, but now in smaller and more convenient packages.\"</p> <p>He asks his readers to carry out a thought experiment: would they rather keep 2002 electronic technology, but lose anything invented in the past decade; or keep the full package of post-2002 innovations, including Twitter, their MP3 player and their iPad \u2013 but give up running water and indoor toilets, just two of the key inventions that transformed the world in the late 19th century.</p> <p>In case you're wavering, he makes it clear that: \"You have to haul the water into your dwelling and carry out the waste. Even at 3am on a rainy night, your only toilet option is a wet and perhaps muddy walk to the outhouse.\" Surely, he insists, even the most hardened Twitter addict would choose a flushing loo over their smartphone.</p> <p>Not only has much of the gain from gadgetry already been banked, Gordon claims, but even if the productivity improvements that took place from 1987 to 2007 were maintained, the US economy will be hampered in the coming decades by powerful headwinds. These include the heavy weight of consumer debt accumulated in the runup to 2007, and the reversal of the demographic dividend that came as the postwar baby-boomer generation grew up, joined the workforce, and paid their taxes.</p> <p>Gordon estimates that once all these challenges are taken into account, GDP growth per capita could slow to just 0.2% a year. That's still economic progress, of a sort \u2013 but it does mean, as Gordon argues, that the 21st century, unlike the 20th, will not be an \"American century\"; and today's young Americans must confront a very different future to that of their parents.</p> <p>They will have to think harder about rationing scarce resources, and perhaps take a humbler stance in relation to their foreign rivals \u2013 something we Brits have become increasingly used to since our own dominance of the global economy gave way to US hegemony.</p> <p>Gordon cheekily points out that per capita growth of 0.2% a year is the same rate economists believe Britain achieved on average in the 600 years or so before the first industrial revolution, which are better remembered for feudalism, illiteracy and back-breaking toil than the onward march of economic progress. But as the star-spangled banner flutters behind a thousand presidential stump speeches between now and November, don't expect to hear too much about that.</p>",
  "<p>It has long been conventional wisdom in Washington political circles that Condoleezza Rice did not desire a future in high political office. After being President George W Bush's national security adviser and then his secretary of state she would simply bask in the afterglow of a career at the heart of global geopolitics.</p> <p>Rice had been so personally loyal to the Bush clan, it was believed that she would leave the stage along with them. She would be happy indulging her twin passions of academia and sports as a faculty member of prestigious Stanford University and, just recently, one of the first women to break into the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/othersports/augusta-national-gains-stature-by-admitting-condoleezza-rice-darla-moore/2012/08/20/3f2f97ca-eb01-11e1-b811-09036bcb182b_story.html\" title=\"\">Augusta National Golf Club</a>.</p> <p>So, when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/30/condoleezza-rice-paul-ryan-republican-convention\" title=\"\">Rice </a>took to the stage at the Republican convention in Tampa, not much in the way of excitement was expected. But when she stepped down 20 or so minutes later, it was into a political world upturned. Not only had the usually calmly spoken, wonkish Rice given an emotional, barn-burning speech of the sort that had thousands of conventioneers cheering in the aisles but it had also hinted in no uncertain terms at the White House.</p> <p>She teed it up like a seasoned campaigner. \"On a personal note,\" she began teasingly after endorsing Mitt Romney to run against President Barack Obama. Then she dipped into her own biography in a way that sounded suspiciously like a stump speech. \"A little girl grows up in Jim Crow Birmingham \u2013 the most segregated big city in America. Her parents can't take her to a movie theatre or a restaurant, but they make her believe that even though she can't have a hamburger at the Woolworths lunch counter, she can be president of the United States,\" Rice said.</p> <p>She has used similar lines before. But, as Rice knows full well, in American politics context is everything and there is no mistaking the context of a national Republican convention. Suddenly, Rice was back at the heart of the action and her ambitions were the hot topic of gossip at Tampa. An intense bout of speculation earlier this year that Romney might pick her as a running mate had been dismissed by most as posturing to show the former Massachusetts governor had a woman on his shortlist.</p> <p>Now it looked like it had been real. If Romney loses in 2012, will we see Rice run in 2016? Or, as she has never run for elected office before, maybe she will start smaller and test out the waters first \u2013 as a California senator, perhaps? \u2013 and then run in 2020. With a few well-picked words and a gift for stirring oratory that many were unaware of, Rice had opened up a stunning new world of possibility: that America's next black president might be a woman and a Republican. That is the thing about the assumptions of conventional wisdom: they can be so easily turned on their head by actual events.</p> <p>Condoleezza Rice, 57, was not exaggerating one jot in the description of the disadvantages of her childhood. Born on 14 November 1954, Rice's childhood was spent in the segregated Deep South where the racial lines were stark and patrolled by the threat of violence. It was something her family knew all about. Rice's father, John Wesley Rice, was a minister but that did not stop him from arming himself with a shotgun, along with other black men in the neighbourhood, when racist whites threatened to attack in the early 1960s (Rice cites the moment as being behind a firm belief in gun rights).</p> <p>In the troubled times of the 1950s and 1960s, few places were worse than Birmingham as America's blacks struggled their way through the civil rights movement. In 1963, a horrific <a href=\"http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAC16.htm\" title=\"\">church bombing</a> in the city (nicknamed grimly \"Bombingham\") shocked the nation as it killed four young black girls, including 11-year-old Denise McNair, one of Rice's childhood friends.</p> <p>\"I know a little bit of what it's like to have somebody try to terrorise a community. These little girls weren't going to hurt anybody. They didn't have any political power,\" she once told an interviewer. \"</p> <p>Yet Rice's childhood was not one defined by trauma. Far from it. Her family, including her high-school teacher mother, Angelena, was a close-knit unit; she was an only child and the focus of her parents' love and ambitions. The Rices also belonged to the small segment of black southern society in Birmingham that formed a solid middle class. Rice's prodigious childhood talents were nurtured. She was a talented pianist (and still plays almost to a professional level). Her unusual name comes from the Italian musical term \"con dolcezza\", meaning \"with sweetness\". She learned foreign languages from a young age, did ballet and figure-skating. In 1967, the family moved to Denver and Rice won a place at the University of Denver in 1971 to study political science.</p> <p>For many Democrats, that story would tick various liberal boxes, just as Barack Obama's biography as a mixed-race child raised by a single white mother from Kansas does. But Rice, as the talented child of a southern preacher who saw first hand the violence of racism, instead eventually drew conservative lessons from life. Her family taught a solid, middle-class work ethic of buckling down, working the system to the best of your ability and trusting America to get it right in the end. Which, in Rice's case at least, it did.</p> <p>Rice worked at her studies, got a masters from Notre Dame, worked briefly in the State Department of President Jimmy Carter and then got a Phd from the University of Denver. She specialised in the Soviet Union, developing hardline conservative foreign policy views, and was eventually hired at Stanford. It was there she first came to the attention of the political clan that would become her second family: the Bushes.</p> <p>Introduced by Bush family adviser Brent Scowcroft, Rice became a family confidante. She served President George HW Bush and then his son, working as George W Bush's foreign policy adviser during the 2000 campaign. After he won, he named her national security adviser and then, in his second term, she became secretary of state. The two were very close, bound by a love of football, prayer and each comfortable with their end of the president-adviser relationship. (She even once mistakenly referred to Bush as \"my husband\".) Of course, it helped that Rice keeps her personal life private. That has fuelled various rumours about her sexuality. She was briefly engaged to a football player in the late 1970s. She explains her solitary ways by simply being so immersed in work.</p> <p>But what one thinks of Rice depends on what one thinks of the Bush years. For many Democrats, and even more people abroad, that means a close association with a failure to spot 9/11 coming, the dreadful horrors of the invasion of Iraq and the neocon ascendancy of the 2000s. So, while Republicans feted and praised Rice after her speech in Tampa, not everyone was pleased to see her. A day before she took to the podium, a group of leftwing protesters tried to enter a Tampa arts centre where Rice was appearing with the intention of \"arresting\" her for war crimes.</p> <p>Yet, if Bush is still not exactly missed by many Republicans , it appears Rice has shed any doubts with the party base left over from her role in his administrations. Partly that may be to do with her race. Republican officials are acutely aware of the lily-white nature of much of their party and when it does try to \"diversify\" that usually means Hispanics. One recent survey showed support for Romney at 0% \u2013 yes, 0% \u2013 among black Americans.</p> <p>In Tampa, two convention-goers were ejected for throwing nuts at a black CNN journalist. Rice offers a high-profile antidote to all of that ugliness. She makes a point of never playing on her race. She is determined that she should be judged on her abilities. She told one interviewer who broached the subject: \"Let me explain to you: I speak French, I play Bach, I'm better in your culture than you are.\"</p> <p>There do not seem to be many obstacles to Rice within the Republican party. When the vice-presidential speculation was circulating, one public opinion poll put Rice as the favourite choice, ahead of eventual pick, <a href=\"http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/08/29/13557231-ryan-accepts-vp-nod-lets-get-this-done?lite\" title=\"\">Congressman Paul Ryan</a>. It is clear that if Rice wants to enter party politics and run for office then there is a receptive Republican audience waiting for her. It will be up to her to make a decision. If she stays out of the spotlight, her academic career and the lucrative lecture circuit will always await. Her Tampa speech will be remembered as a one-off, full-throated roar of what might have been.</p> <p>But if she takes a risk, if she really does go for it, last week will mark the beginning of something entirely new and unexpected.</p> <p>* This article was amended on 6 September 2012 to make it clear that the experience of watching her father defend their neighbourhood against white supremacists made Condoleezza Rice a firm believer in gun rights. The piece originally said that these experiences made her a believer in gun control.</p>",
  "<p>OK, here's the statutory health warning: for a long, long time, people have been saying that the next US presidential election will be \"the internet election\". And thus far, all those predictions have turned out to be wrong, at least if one interprets them as claims that the outcome of the election is effectively determined by online activity.</p> <p>The inspiration for all this speculation about the political impact of the net is an older communications technology \u2013 television. In the 1950s, people speculated endlessly about that medium's impact on politics, but it was only in 1960, with the famous <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6Xn4ipHiwE\" title=\"\">televised debates</a> between John F Kennedy and Richard Nixon, that speculation hardened into certainty: TV was the key factor in presidential politics.</p> <p>And that was the conventional wisdom for the next three decades, until the web turned the internet into something that \"ordinary\" people began to use.</p> <p>For at least a decade since, people have been seeking an analogous tipping point for online media. Some argued that Barack Obama's mastery of social networking in 2008 was critical in ensuring his election. Sceptics countered with the view that the impact of online media paled into insignificance compared with the damage the Republicans inflicted on themselves by nominating Sarah Palin as John McCain's running mate and aspiring vice-president.</p> <p>So will the 2012 election provide the tipping point, the moment when the internet plays a decisive role in influencing how people vote? Given the penetration of the network into daily life, it's obviously implausible to maintain that it isn't having <em>some</em> impact on politics. The yawning gap that existed in the 1990s between cyberspace (where people do \"social networking\") and \"meatspace\" (where they go to polling stations and vote) has clearly shrunk. But by how much?</p> <p>Judging by current online activity, if the internet decided the outcome Obama would win by a mile. His <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/barackobama\" title=\"\">Facebook page</a>, for example, has more than 28m \"likes\" and had more than 1.7m people \"talking\" about it when I last checked. <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/mittromney\" title=\"\">Romney's page</a> has a mere 5.5m \"likes\" (but more than 2m people were \"talking\" about it). On Twitter, Obama is way ahead by all the <a href=\"http://2012twit.com/\" title=\"\">significant metrics</a>: followers (19m to Romney's 954,000); number of followers added in past 24 hours (46,000 v 13,000); mentions (59,000 v 29,000); retweets (25,000 v 6,600); retweeters (22,000 v 5,000). I could go on, but you get the picture.</p> <p>Last week also saw a revealing contrast between the two camps. Romney's crowd put everything into an intensively scripted, 1980s-style rebranding of their candidate, using all the tired old tricks of <em>Mad Men</em> and old media. Obama, in contrast, just turned up on Reddit.com and did an AMA (Ask Me Anything) <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/us-news-blog/2012/aug/29/barack-obama-ask-me-anything-reddit\" title=\"\">session</a>, which brought the site to its knees. If you don't know about Reddit then I suggest you take a look; then ask yourself how many contemporary British politicians you can think of who would dare to do an AMA session on it. (My answer: one \u2013 John Prescott.)</p> <p>The big question is whether Obama's online dominance will make much difference. My hunch is that it won't. This is not because the net isn't important, but because of the peculiar nature of this election. According to a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/the-incredible-shrinking%E2%80%94and-increasingly-valuable%E2%80%94undecided-voter/2012/07/23/gJQAcRMH4W_blog.html\" title=\"\">recent poll</a>, most voters have already made up their minds and only about 6% remain undecided as to how they will vote in November. One analyst, <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2012/07/15/paul-begala-on-the-swing-voters-who-will-pick-the-president.html\" title=\"\">Paul Begala</a>, a former adviser to Bill Clinton, thinks that the election will be decided by just 4% of the voters, in six states \u2013 Virginia, Florida, Ohio, Iowa, New Mexico and Colorado. That's 916,643 people, or \"fewer than half the number of people who paid to get into a Houston Astros home game last year\".</p> <p>Most of these \"undecideds\" are not interested in politics. But they are almost certainly among the <a href=\"http://www.socialbakers.com/facebook-statistics/united-states\" title=\"\">164m Americans currently on Facebook</a>, which is why one commentator, <a href=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/news/428530/facebook-the-real-presidential-swing-state/\" title=\"\">David Talbot</a>, has dubbed it \"the real presidential swing state\". The thing about Facebook is that many users reveal fine-grained information about themselves \u2013 home town, age, education, preferences, friends. People who are uninterested in politics are unlikely to be swayed by overtly \"political\" messages, but they might be amenable to messages from their Facebook contacts. So, voters in swing states such as Ohio or Florida who have \"liked\" a Facebook page describing Romney as a \"vulture capitalist\" might suddenly find themselves getting messages from \"friends\" reminding them that they buy stationery from Staples, a successful company that Romney invested in.</p> <p>Even in a networked world, all politics will ultimately turn out to be local politics.</p>",
  "<p>Armando Iannucci has a confession to make. \"The thing is, I don't despise them,\" he says. \"I've always been fascinated by politics. Read up on political history. Love all the election shows. I am a political geek.\"</p> <p>At the age of 14 or 15, he would take himself off to a public library in Glasgow to read Hansard. I remark that William Hague is the only other person who has ever been heard admitting to the nerdish compulsion to read the parliamentary record as a teenager. \"Yeah,\" he nods, wincing slightly. \"I know.\"</p> <p>We have met for lunch in a break between final edits of the new series of <em>The Thick of It</em>. The hugely acclaimed comedy has achieved the rare feat of being a hit with viewers, channel controllers, critics, juries of TV awards and the targets of its superbly realised satire. It has not only influenced how viewing voters think about government, it is also a reference point for how the practitioners of politics perceive themselves. I tell him that, in the 48 hours before we meet, I have heard a Downing Street official describe a meeting at Number 10 as \"like a scene from<strong> </strong><em>The Thick of It</em><strong>\"</strong>, and a senior aide to Ed Miliband has told me of a conversation in the Labour leader's office \"so surreal it could have been scripted by Armando Iannucci\".</p> <p>He has always taken meticulous care to make the show feel real, so he is bound to be tickled by approving notices from his victims. He recalls meeting James Purnell, who was culture secretary at the time, at a Royal Television Society dinner. They talked about the very first episode when the cast are in the back of a car feverishly trying to concoct a policy on the hoof. Purnell said: \"I've been in the back of that car.\"</p> <p>When<strong> </strong><em>The Thick of It</em><strong> </strong>was last on screen three years ago, Labour was still in power<strong> </strong>and therefore the primary target. The latest \u2013 and, he reveals to me, probably the last \u2013 series begins by training its sights on the coalition. Peter Mannion, the world-weary, technologically inept old-school Tory played by Roger Allam, channelling a substantial helping of Ken Clarke, is now in charge at Dosac, the Department of Social Affairs and Citizenship. He is in uncomfortable tandem with a minister from \"the Inbetweeners\", as the Lib Dems are called. There is a natural comic dynamic from the two of them \"trying to look like a public united front but secretly trying to get the credit for whichever policy\". Dosac's former Labour boss, the hapless Nicola Murray<strong>, </strong>played by Rebecca Front, has become leader of the opposition by a quirk of the block vote mechanism that no one understands. The cast may have shuffled positions, but the animating spirit of the satire remains the same: the cunning plans of the political class come farcically unstuck in ways that reveal them to be clueless, hopeless and powerless.</p> <p>Iannucci makes viewers wait for the return of his mesmerising monster. It is not until episode 2 that we are reintroduced to Peter Capaldi as Malcolm Tucker, the confabulation of all that is most foul about spin doctors. I wonder if his creator ever worries that his most loathsome character is also his most popular. \"Yes, I do worry. I find it very worrying.\" He finds it especially anxiety-inducing when he meets real-life spin doctors because \"they always talk about how much they like Malcolm and<strong> </strong>how they try and emulate Malcolm. And I think, have we got this wrong?\" When the production went to film in Downing Street, some of the inhabitants of Number 10 came out, wanting to have their pictures taken with Capaldi/Tucker. \"Obviously, we all look forward to the Malcolm moments in the same way we look forward to the Darth Vader moments in <em>Star Wars</em> and Satan's speeches in <em>Paradise Lost</em>. But isn't he meant to be a horrible cunt? Isn't that who Malcolm is? So why are all these people saying, 'Do you know the one I want to be? I want to be the horrible cunt.' Doesn't that say something about politics?\"</p> <p>Perhaps it does. Perhaps it also says something important and not very healthy about the impact of what he puts on our screens. I love <em>The Thick of It</em>, but I tell him that I am also gnawed by a worm of anxiety that there are viewers who will take it not as a satire of some of the worst dimensions of politics but a representation of the totality of politics. When the denizens of his version of Westminster can't organise a photo opportunity without collapsing into calamity, never mind execute a policy that might improve someone's life, what is he trying to say about government to voters? He responds that the show \"never set out to have an agenda. It wasn't a manifesto. It was entertainment.\"</p> <p>The principal driver has always been comedic. \"We see these grand looking buildings down Whitehall. So you assume the people within them kind of know what they're doing with power. And part of the comedy is going through those doors and discovering that they don't really. Although it's a big job, it's actually little people.\"</p> <p>The contrast between the outward pomp and the inner reality also drives the comedy of <a href=\"http://skyatlantic.sky.com/shows/veep\" title=\"\"><em>Veep</em></a>, his American show screened in Britain on Sky Atlantic. Taking his satire across the Atlantic entailed some risk, I suggest, because Americans tend to idealise their democracy much more than the British.&#xa0;\"I think you're right. The interesting thing in America is how much they respect the office even though they're contemptuous of the office-holder. A lot of people were asking, do you think America is going to be ready for this? I thought I was going to get, what brings you here, a Brit, telling us about our politics?\"</p> <p>As it turns out, the show is another hit. If there was any hate mail from outraged Americans \"it hasn't got to me \u2013 probably goes to HBO\". It's <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/03/julia-louis-dreyfus-emmy-veep_n_1735534.html\" title=\"\">up for an Emmy</a> and HBO has commissioned a second season. Three researchers were employed in Washington to help with the \"accuracy\", and he worked \"very closely with the cast\" to avoid scripting references or gags that wouldn't work for an American audience. After a while the actors stopped saying: \"We think that's a bit English.\" Instead, they made \"a set of noises\", an idea started by Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who plays the title role. \"She would say, 'We think that's a bit haw-haw-haw.\"'</p> <p>The position of vice-president, described by one of its real-life occupants as \"not worth a bucket of warm piss\", has all the trappings of high office and no real power, making it the perfect subject for Iannucci. A running joke has the Veep asking her assistant: \"Did the president call?\" and always receiving a negative answer.</p> <p>How did the lad who got his teenage kicks from Hansard turn into our most gifted TV satirist, with shows bathed in praise on both sides of the Atlantic? I wonder if it's something in his Italian DNA. Italians have more reasons than most to feel betrayed by government. After mulling on it, Iannucci says he can see how his take on politics might have been shaped by his father. Before he emigrated to Britain, Dad was a journalist in Mussolini's Italy, wrote for an anti-fascist newspaper \"and then had to take to the hills and join the partisans, and as soon as the war was over he got out\". He found a new home in Glasgow but he wasn't a British citizen so he couldn't vote. \"I remember saying to him, 'Are you not frustrated you can't vote in the election?' He said, 'Well, the last election I remember, Mussolini got in.' So, you know: what good is your vote? Maybe it was that side.\"</p> <p>Mum was a first-generation immigrant. She was born in Glasgow but to an entirely Italian family. \"So it's all Italian blood.\" Yet his parents \"never brought us up speaking Italian because they thought it's better to feel integrated\". As a result, \"you feel Scottish, but not quite. But neither do you feel completely Italian. You're always slightly standing back from it and kind of observing\".</p> <p>Not sure whether you are inside or out?</p> <p>\"Yeah,\" he responds. \"Just, well, feeling half in and half out.\"</p> <p>Now, though, he is most definitely in with the British establishment. He has been begonged with the Order of the British Empire, an irony I want to spend some time teasing him about. You could easily imagine an episode of <em>The Thick of It</em> crafted around the comedy of pinning this Whitehall bauble on a man who makes his living from ridiculing government. Why accept an OBE? \"I thought it would be funny. That's why,\" he says, a touch defensively. Funny \u2013 how? \"I just think it's hilarious.\" He quickly adds: \"I mean, I'm not intending to use it or anything.\"</p> <p>So the credits of the new series don't say \"Armando Iannucci OBE\"?</p> <p>\"No,\" he recoils. \"I just think it's like\u2026 I mean either you accept awards or you don't. You know, either you put yourself forward for Baftas and whatever or you don't.\"</p> <p>Mmm. You win a Bafta because your peer group wants to salute outstanding work. You get an OBE because an official in the Cabinet Office has put you on a list.</p> <p>\"Someone must have nominated me,\" he protests. Or maybe some civil servants thought they would have the last laugh on the great satirist by dangling a morsel from the establishment's table in front of him to see whether he would gratefully bite. Didn't that occur to him?</p> <p>\"To be honest, I don't care if they think that. I don't care. I just thought it'd be funny and I was looking forward to ringing my mum and telling her.\"</p> <p>She was proud? \"Very pleased, yeah.\"</p> <p>This prompts me to the speculation that he accepted the OBE in part because of the ambivalent feelings about identity we had explored earlier. The honour was a badge of acceptance. He doesn't quarrel with this idea; indeed he eagerly embraces it as a much better explanation than the earlier ones he has offered. \"Yeah,\" he says vigorously. \"My grandfather [on his mother's side] was rounded up during the second world war and put in a camp because he was Italian. So there's that element: have we quite fitted in? Do people see us as British? So I can now say, right, OK, there you are, here's a document that proves it, so don't worry. Other than that, I see it as very nice, happy to get the recognition and then put it to one side and don't mention it again.\"</p> <p>Where would he stop? Is he hoping for a knighthood next?</p> <p>\"I think that would be taking the joke too far.\"</p> <p>A question I am keen to get my teeth into is whether the treatment given to politics on British television has gone beyond a joke. He may say he does not despise politicians, he may insist that his agenda is no more than comedic, but I want to investigate whether he feels any responsibility for the fact that so many of the British do hold politics in a deep contempt, a contempt that is often richly deserved but which can also be indiscriminate, lazy and ultimately poisonous for democracy. Iannucci describes himself as \"a sort of vague, woolly liberal with a small l. Left of centre-ish.\" Yet the moral we are invited to draw from his work is not at all \"left of centre-ish\". <em>The Thick of It</em> tells us that politics is a profession populated only by fools and knaves. The laughs nudge the viewer to the profoundly serious conclusion that all government is crap. Does he ever worry that, whether he means to or not, his message is basically the same as that of the Tea Party and Fox TV?</p> <p>\"Wow,\" he says, taken aback. \"I'm not sure it says government is crap. I think it says the people in government are crap.\"</p> <p>Does that make any difference? Either way, isn't he guiding the audience to the reactionary or nihilistic view that government is pointless? He approaches the question sideways by explaining how his thinking has developed. The first series of <em>The Thick of It</em> \"was very much coming in on the back of Blair and Iraq, and how did that happen?\" It was driven by an idea of Blair as \"someone with a domineering, centralised control over government\" with \"a group of bully boys, the enforcers, who would visit departments and just tell the minister this is what you say, this is your newest line to take, this is your view\". In the second series, \"I started feeling a little bit of sympathy for politicians. We the people put this pressure on them to be absolutely perfect, to not stumble, to have a fully thought-out, fully budgeted opinion on every topic we throw at them. Not to buy anything, not to have a salary, not to go on holiday, none of that. I actually started feeling sorry for them.\"</p> <p>Making this latest series has led him to a more fundamental conclusion. \"This time around I've kind of come at it with a feeling that the whole system just doesn't work. And it's primarily because we have a generation of politicians who have done nothing apart from politics. They do the politics degree, become a researcher, become an adviser, become an MP; they're in the cabinet by the time they're 39.\"</p> <p>True enough. Books have been written about the rise to dominance of a professional political class. Whatever their ideological differences, David Cameron, George Osborne, Ed Miliband, Ed Balls and Nick Clegg have this in common: they have spent all, or nearly all, of their adult lives in politics. Despite their lack of experience of anything else, says Iannucci, warming to this theme, \"the generation we have now running politics has felt all the more the need to interfere in minute detail in the working of every department. So it's not just about the big plans \u2013 like how many hospitals can we afford. It's what kind of books you should be reading, how to do homework. What we have are people with no experience, but trying to micro-manage.\"</p> <p>That is a speech, I remark, which would be welcomed with loud applause by many Tories. Absolutely right, they would cry: let's have much less government, sack most of the civil service, roll back the meddlesome state. He again protests that this is not his agenda. \"There's an alternative view. The machinery of government can work, but what you [the politician] need is not to feel that you are infallible. It's all right to take your time and actually listen to people with more specialist knowledge. Because the other thing that's weird is that someone could be running, say, the health service for 18 months and then overnight is in charge of the military or police or prisons \u2013 do you know what I mean?\"</p> <p>I do. Mind you, I have my doubts that government by \"experts\", also known as vested interests, would always prove to be a great experience for the voters. Is he saying that the army should answer only to generals, education policy should be made only by teachers and how we run jails should be the sole prerogative of prison officers?</p> <p>\"No, no, no, no, no,\" he responds. \"But I think what's happened, as you pointed out, is as they got less and less direct power, we've built up this idea of politicians being these super beings from whom all final decisions flow, and I just feel that something's kind of not right. I don't have the solution to it. It's just an observation that I feel it doesn't work.\"</p> <p>In portraying those who govern us as blundering idiots or amoral schemers, he splices the two strongest traditions of political satire on British television. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FRVvjGL2C0\" title=\"\"><em>Yes Minister</em></a> and its sequel <em>Yes, Prime Minister</em> depicted politicians as the gulled puppets of wily civil servants. Antony Jay and Jonathan Lynn had a great success with that in the 1980s, despite their show being utterly untrue to reality. Margaret Thatcher, the least Jim Hackerish of politicians, was bending the civil service \u2013 and a whole lot else \u2013 to her will.</p> <p>The politician as machinating villain inspired the antihero of Michael Dobbs's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylu3x72WHTs\" title=\"\"><em>House of Cards,</em></a> in which a satanic Ian Richardson as Francis Urquhart murdered his way to the premiership. Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran created the Thatcherite grotesque, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKFsEt_3zzk\" title=\"\">Alan B'Stard</a> for Rik Mayall.</p> <p>While consistently excelling at satirising Westminster, British television has failed \u2013 in fact, rarely even attempted\u2013 to dramatise politics as it really is. The Americans had a go with <em>The West Wing</em>. Aaron Sorkin's show was too romantic to be entirely realistic \u2013 \"a liberal wet dream\" of an American presidency, as <em>Wall Street Journal </em>columnist Peggy Noonan described it. Its considerable merit was that it attempted to show politicians and their advisers wrestling with sophisticated policy dilemmas and hard moral choices, sometimes getting it wrong and sometimes right.</p> <p>The Danish political drama, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b019ch5q/episodes/guide\" title=\"\"><em>Borgen</em></a>, recently shown on BBC4, is a classy, gripping and highly textured series that gives an authentic sense of the pressures of running a modern government and how the stress can destroy relationships, even between fundamentally decent people.</p> <p>I ask Iannucci why he thinks British television has not been capable of producing something comparable? Part of the problem, he says, is persuading TV executives to commission anything about politics. \"I remember when I was getting <em>The Thick of It</em> under way. It was a time when if you said 'politics' to them, they'd say, 'No, people aren't interested. Boring. Wouldn't get viewers.'\"</p> <p>He was fortunate: \"I think I was quite lucky because BBC4 was just starting and that was seen as being a bit experimental \u2013 so we could try it. If it didn't work, it didn't work. At least we tried it. And it also meant we didn't have much money, so that affected the style of it, the very fast shooting style.\"</p> <p>He thinks it may also have something to do with Americans having developed a different attitude towards television. \"They just take it more seriously. It used to be film was the art form. I think they realise, as TV screens have got bigger, TV is like a movie experience in the home. So now you can actually do more with television, up the game and do more challenging work. We're just beginning in the UK to think we've been caught napping.\"</p> <p>The next challenge for him is whether there is much more satirical juice to be squeezed out of our political lemons. Fiction now struggles to compete with reality when Boris Johnson makes an arse of himself by getting stuck on a zip wire, Jeremy Hunt almost clouts a bystander with an Olympic bell, the budget unravels over taxes on pasties, David Cameron texts \"lol\" to a tabloid executive without knowing it stands for \"laugh out loud\" and Francis Maude recommends that people prepare for a petrol shortage by filling up their jerry cans. I put it to Iannucci that it is time to swivel his guns on to a fresh target, to go after people who really wield great, global, unaccountable power: bankers, say, or the magnates of social media.</p> <p>This suggestion is greeted with a smile: \"I'm thinking that very thought.\"</p> <p>He goes on to explain: \"Probably this will be the last series of <em>The Thick of It</em>. The door is left open at the end to come back and do specials. But I feel I have explored every crevice now and it's time to take stock and move on. I'm thinking about the power of the internet.\"</p> <p>This sounds like an excellent idea. Who, after all, has the more power: a British cabinet minister or the emperors of Google?</p> <p>\"Exactly,\" he nods. \"Microsoft, Google, Facebook: you have these twentysomethings who have a way into billions of households. It's what we were talking about earlier: where's the power gone? The power is gravitating towards these companies.\"</p> <p>He reveals that he has already done a script for HBO for a show set in Silicon Valley.</p> <p>\"I'm also interested in that personal thing of what it does to you when you're 25 and you're a multibillionaire and everyone in the world knows who you are.\"</p> <p>I'm glad to hear this. It is long past time that the over-revered, under-scrutinised, vastly rich and powerful spiders of the web felt the business end of a sharp satirical stick. I can't think of anyone better to wield it than the brilliant geek from Glasgow.</p>",

Vote. That's the best response. Vote and get some of your best friends to vote,\" he told the audience at a rally on a campus of Colorado State University.</p> <p>The tone of urgency was notable. The 2008 version of Obama had no trouble getting people to go to the ballot box during his historic election win. But in 2012 it is a different game. Battered by the realities of four years in office and with a party base that often believes he has let them down, Obama is facing an enthusiasm gap as he prepares to rally Democrats at their nomination convention in Charlotte, North Carolina.</p> <p>It will not be an easy task and his speech on Thursday night will be a test of whether Obama the president can rekindle the sort of emotion that saw Obama the candidate run one of the most remarkable campaigns of modern American history. \"A lot of people feel that it has been politics as usual and there has been no fundamental change. It is a real problem for him,\" said Professor Shaun Bowler, a political scientist at the University of California at Riverside.</p> <p>That enthusiasm gap in the fight against Republican challenger Mitt Romney can be read in poll numbers. At this point in 2008, 63% of Americans viewed Obama favourably. Now it is 53%. It can also be seen at the rallies. Though Obama can still draw a crowd, the numbers, and the venues, are smaller than four years ago.</p> <p>Commentators remark on a noticeably flatter atmosphere. It is an issue acknowledged in Obama's speeches, where he makes cracks about his greying hair and refers to his famous \"hope and change\" slogan of the last campaign. \"They'll tell you that if you believed in change four years ago then you were foolish. They hope you'll be discouraged and stay away [from the polls] this time,\" Obama told a mostly student crowd in Iowa at another campaign stop.</p> <p>Of course, talking about a problem is a surefire way to acknowledge that it exists. Though no one has to tell Bob Fulkerson about it.</p> <p>Fulkerson is co-founder of the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada, a group that campaigns on left-leaning causes in the vital south-western swing state. In 2008 Obama won Nevada by 12 points. Now it is a close-run race. As he knocks on doors throughout the state, Fulkerson can feel the difference. \"He was a knight in shining armour. Four years later? OK, there is some disappointment,\" he said. \"We still have to fight like hell to get this guy re-elected.\"</p> <p>The reasons for the disappointment are twofold. First is the continuing economic malaise and high unemployment still gripping America. Though he came to power in the midst of an economic crisis, Obama has stabilised the situation rather than kick-starting a boom. That allows Republicans to attack his economic record. Second, there has been a series of policy disappointments.</p> <p>Obama sent more troops to Afghanistan, failed to close the detention camp of Guant\u00e1namo Bay and his healthcare reforms are unpopular with both left and right. His curbs on Wall Street have been seen as weak and his administration as still too close to the banking industry.</p> <p>The situation also explains the staggering level of negativity in the all-important \"ad wars\" flung at the Romney camp. Obama's team, led by famed \"hatchet man\" David Axelrod, has assaulted voters in vital swing states with brutal takedowns of Romney. They have featured Romney singing off-key, speculated openly that he might not pay taxes and played dirty when it comes taking remarks out of context. A low point came when Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid speculated publicly that Romney might not have paid tax for a decade, even while admitting he had no idea if the allegations were true.</p> <p>It is a long way from the sunny optimism of 2008. \"This has been a dismal election campaign,\" said Larry Haas, a political expert and former aide in the Bill Clinton White House. However, Haas believes that Obama still has key advantages such as the organisation left over from the 2008 campaign that will provide hard-to-beat numbers of boots on the ground. \"The president built a very impressive operation in 2008 and he has spent four more years building it up. That will ensure he gets the maximum number of people out to vote,\" Haas said.</p> <p>Obama has also been helped by his opposition. The Republican nomination race was marked by bizarre and eccentric campaigns. When Romney emerged as winner it was as head of a conservative base yet to warm to him. He has been hindered by a lack of charisma, by his image as a wealthy financier and by his choice of hard-line social and fiscal conservative Paul Ryan as a running mate.</p> <p>That is certainly what Fulkerson finds in the cities, suburbs and small towns of Nevada. While Obama and the Democrats may be a tougher sell this year, persuading people that they should worry about Romney and Ryan is easy. \"The stakes are too high to give up now,\" Fulkerson said. \"Except it's not hope and change any more, it is more hope and fear.\"</p>",

To chants of \"four more years, four more years\", the president called on voters to help him take the country forward.</p> <p>\"We have come too far to turn back now, that is why I'm asking for a second term,\" he said.</p> <p>The president contrasted his agenda with that of the Republicans, a blueprint for America that was \"better suited for the last century\".</p> <p>The Republican convention didn't offer \"a single new idea\", Obama said, added: \"It was a rerun. We'd seen it all before, you might as well have watched it on a black-and-white TV\".</p> <p>The Iowa set-piece event kicked off a four-day tour of swing states as Obama makes his way to Charlotte, North Carolina, for the Democratic National Convention next week.</p> <p>Saturday's campaigning serves as a potential political barometer as to where the momentum lies in the race at present.</p> <p>And despite a convention that was blown off course \u2013 initially by tropical storm Isaac and then by a somewhat bizarre star turn by actor/director Clint Eastwood \u2013 Romney appeared to campaign with a little more swagger on Saturday.</p> <p>His rhetoric was delivered with greater passion than is usual for a candidate that many have accused of being too wooden. At one point, he even appeared to tear up a little, as an enthusiastic crowd in Cincinnati broke into a chant of \"Mitt, Mitt, Mitt\".</p> <p>He was aided by a decision to give the candidate's wife Ann a greater prominence. Mrs Romney was one of the stars of the Republican convention in Tampa, managing to humanise her husband in a much-praised address to the party faithful.</p> <p>Encouraged by her reception, Republican strategists have seemingly decided to give the candidate's spouse a more central role.</p> <p>Introducing her husband, Ann Romney noted that many families in America were suffering as a result of a sluggish economy.</p> <p>\"Help is on the way,\" she told the cheering crowd, handing over to husband Mitt.</p> <p>For his part, Romney gave a recap of his convention address, using many of the same key phrases and throwing around the same accusations of fiscal mismanagement at the White House incumbent, while also mocking Obama's aspirations to combat global warming</p> <p>He also laid out a campaign platform that includes making North America energy independent, lowering taxes and reducing the national debt.</p> <p>Romney also sought to present himself as the \"unity\" candidate, lashing out as what he perceived to be the \"divisiveness and bitterness\" of the Obama campaign.</p> <p>\"I will bring us together,\" he told supporters, adding that under his watch \"America is going to come roaring back\".</p> <p>The country is overdue a \"winning season\", Romney added.</p> <p>Obama's criss-crossing of the country is aimed at countering the Republican candidate's message, and putting a halt to any post convention Romney bump.</p> <p>After Iowa, Obama will campaign in Colorado and Ohio in a busy weekend schedule.</p> <p>The focus on key states comes amid polling that suggest a tight White House race, which could be decided by where independent voters decide to put their cross come election day.</p> <p>Obama will get the chance to appeal to a national audience on Thursday when he will deliver his keynote convention address.</p> <p>That speech is expected to hang on pledges to end tax cuts for the rich, while putting more effort into education, energy and debt reduction.</p> <p>It has been reported that he will dismiss Romney as a peddler of failed trickle-down ideas that will hurt struggling families.</p> <p>Obama campaign aide Stephanie Cutter said the convention would rely less on rallying the base or levelling \"petty attacks\" on his rival, but would rather focus on \"what we need to do with the country to move us forward, not back\".</p> <p>\"We don't need to reintroduce the president or reinvent him, as in the case with Mitt Romney,\" she said. \"Instead, our convention will tell the story of the last four years, how the president made some tough choices to help a country and the economy recover.\"</p>",
  "<p>When Mitt Romney took to the stage in Tampa last week to cap three days of conventioneering his real audience was not the entire nation of America. Instead, like all political advertising in the close 2012 race, it was geared toward a narrow band of swing states that will decide the election.</p> <p>Forget California, New York or Texas. Those states are already either red or blue. Instead it is the \"purple\" America of Ohio, Virginia, Florida, Colorado, Iowa, New Hampshire, Wisconsin and Nevada that really matters.

  "<p>God loves Republicans, as they'll be the first to tell you. A Florida pastor is taking credit for praying <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/29/hurricane-isaac-louisiana-levee-flood\" title=\"\">Hurricane Isaac</a> away from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/29/republican-national-convention-ryan-live\" title=\"\">Republican national convention</a>. Instead, the wind and water went off to smite the wicked (and largely Democratic) city of New Orleans.</p> <p>The GOP faithful see the US as a chosen nation, blessed with prosperity through a special relationship with the almighty. At the convention in Tampa, speaker after speaker invoked the deity almost as often as they talked about money. There's a long history of this, of course, going back to the Puritans. John Robinson, pastor to the Mayflower pilgrims, said: \"The blessings of the Lord make rich, and as riches are themselves God's blessings, so we do desire them, for the comfortable course of our natural and civil states.\"</p> <p>Mitt Romney and his running mate Paul Ryan both tout their faith as the foundation of their politics and, though Romney's a Mormon and Ryan a Roman Catholic, both espouse puritan notions of wealth through righteousness, never mind what Jesus said about how it's \"easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God\". Perhaps when he goes to meet his maker, Romney will just whip out his platinum card and buy a very large needle.</p> <p>Ryan, whose path to prosperity budget blueprint has made him a star among ultra-conservatives, largely ignores his church's teachings on social justice. His plan would slash $6tn from everything except the Pentagon war machine and America's fat and happy plutocracy. More than 60% of Ryan's cuts would hit programmes for the poor, the old, the sick and the unemployed. America's Catholic bishops, not exactly commie pinkos, sent a letter to Congress calling Ryan's attack on the poor \"unjustified and wrong\". Perhaps Ryan didn't pay attention in Sunday school; perhaps he hid <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fountainhead\" title=\"\">The Fountainhead </a>inside his New Testament.</p> <p>Not everyone would lose out in Ryan's scheme: the richest would get a tax break. Romney \u2013 the standard-bearer for the 1% \u2013 would pay less than 1%. Praise the Lord!</p> <p>Once the party of civil rights, progressive gender politics and environmental stewardship, today's Republicans are obsessed with cutting taxes and imposing their version of sexual morality on a depraved \"reality\" TV-watching populace. You'd think they were disciples of Michael Wigglesworth, the 17th-century Massachusetts preacher whose pronouncements (as Huck Finn said of Pilgrim's Progress) were \"interesting but tough\".</p> <p>Like Romney, Wigglesworth was a Harvard graduate; like both Romney and Ryan, he had an unflinching, un-nuanced sense of sin, as expounded in his 1662 best-selling poem <a href=\"http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/1253/\" title=\"\">The Day of Doom</a>. God appears at the Last Judgment and brusquely separates humanity into sheep (good) and goats (bad). \"Amorites and sodomites\", drinkers, people who lived virtuously though without faith, people who couldn't understand the Bible, people who never heard of the Bible, people who didn't get a chance to repent, people who counted on God's last-minute mercy, uppity women and \"reprobate infants\" \u2013 unbaptised babies \u2013 all headed for eternal torment.</p> <p>The babies put up a fight, arguing they shouldn't be blamed (they're babies, after all) but God says sorry, rules are rules. The best he can do is give them \"the easiest room in hell\".</p> <p>Ryan is not, as far as we know, a reader of Wigglesworth. He's a long-time disciple of Ayn Rand, though lately he's been trying to disassociate himself from her, what with her being a pro-choice atheist (he's just now figuring that out?). He hasn't weighed in on the way her fiction romanticises rape. Perhaps he should, given his association with the notorious Missouri Republican Todd Akin \u2013 the guy who opined that victims of \"legitimate rape\" didn't get pregnant. This past congressional session, Ryan joined Akin and other Republicans in trying to redefine rape and push a \"personhood\" bill, giving zygotes the same 14th amendment rights as citizens.</p> <p>Lately Ryan's been citing Thomas Aquinas. He should take another look at <a href=\"http://www.ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/summa.html\" title=\"\">Summa Theologica</a>. In part II, St Thomas argues: \"Whatever a man has in superabundance is owed, of natural right, to the poor for their sustenance. So Ambrosius says, and it is also to be found in the Decretum Gratiani: 'The bread which you withhold belongs to the hungry: the clothing you shut away, to the naked: and the money you bury in the earth is the redemption and freedom of the penniless.'\"</p> <p>The call to share seems pretty clear, but Ryan (and Romney) cling to the conviction that America should reward those to whom much has been given, and take from those who have next to nothing. Romney tithes (his wife has been quoted as saying that when they give their cheque to the church, \"I actually cry!\"), but he won't release his tax returns and refuses to acknowledge that a little charity sprinkled on top of social Darwinist economics still tastes bitter to most Americans. It's all about profit. William Perkins, a Cambridge divine very influential in 17th-century New England, endorsed a society of haves and have-nots: \"If we happen to have inherited much property, we are to enjoy these in good conscience as blessings and gifts of God.\"</p> <p>In the puritan tradition, money was a sign of God's favour, even of virtue. Three centuries later, Americans still think rich people (even Donald Trump) must be doing something right. Jesus's \"feed my sheep\" stuff? That's socialism. If those sheep were real Americans, they'd get up off their woolly backsides and get a job. Maybe they're just goats in disguise, the undeserving poor. As Wigglesworth put it:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>You sinners are, and such a share <br>As sinners may expect,<br>Such you shall have; for I do save<br>None but my own elect.</p> </blockquote>"
