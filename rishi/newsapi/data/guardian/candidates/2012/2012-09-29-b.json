[
  "<p>In Blackburn's new market, a strange, sanitised place in the airless basement of a shopping centre, Jack Straw is buying fresh fish for his dinner and I am trying hard not to feel too much like a spare part. When he asked me to follow him in here, I was convinced this was a move designed to make him seem, in my eyes, more humble: the ex-minister carefully examining the mackerel and the maris pipers, just like the rest of us. I could easily have waited in the car with one of the protection officers who still travel with him whenever he visits his constituency. Now, though, I see that ordinariness isn't the half of it. It was surely the stallholders he wanted me to see: specifically, their reaction to him. For in Blackburn Market, at least, no one seems tempted to spring an unfortunate question about Iraq or extraordinary renditions. Rather, it is as if a distant but much loved uncle has arrived in town. There is gossip and there is banter. There are warm handshakes and updates on business. There is even \u2013 from one of the women behind the sandwich stall \u2013 a smacking great kiss.</p> <p>Straw has been Blackburn's MP for 33 years; he replaced Barbara Castle, for whom he had worked as a special adviser (something of a talent-spotter, Castle once said that she had employed Straw for his \"guile and low cunning\"). He loves the town, or so he says, and on the train up this morning \u2013 we travelled in what he calls, euphemistically, \"soft class\" \u2013 he happily bombarded me with Blackburn facts: the people, the places, the problems. In the unmarked police car that brought us from Preston to the town, he pointed out all the sights: the brewery, the abandoned mills, an unlikely shop called Reidys, otherwise known as the \"musicians' superstore\".</p> <p>His tourist-guide zeal is so passionate, you might take him for an exile, a deracinated Lancastrian, rather than for what he really is \u2013 an Essex boy, with homes in London and the Cotswolds. He faltered only when faced with the monolith of the 1960s extension to the town hall; not even he&#xa0;could find anything nice to say about that.</p> <p>Straw finishes his shopping \u2013 \"They're concerned, quite rightly, about plans to let some stalls to artisans at a reduced rate,\" he tells me as we scoot out \u2013 and we get on with the rest of our day. It's busy. First, we go to his constituency home (stoutly Victorian and now with added bulletproof glass), so he can drop off his shopping and submit to the first of several interrogations by me. Then we visit an engineering company, one that is having trouble with its bank. Lunch is taken at the constituency office, after which it's back in the car to see the police chief. Finally \u2013 it's by now tea time \u2013 Straw heads to the community centre where he will hold the first of two regular surgeries.</p> <p>As we walk in, it's clear the first of these will overrun wildly: the queue extends far beyond the cluster of chairs by the door. I shoot him a glance. Is he flagging? Apparently not. \"Right!\" he says, clapping his hands together. \"Let's get on with this.\" He has been holding surgeries for more than three decades, yet he still has all the enthusiasm of the tyro.</p> <p>It is, of course, a masterstroke to let me sit in on these meetings, an even defter move than dragging me to the shops. For this is Straw at his best: patient, kind and determined in the case of those whose need is obvious; firm and fair in the case of those who are trying it on. His knowledge \u2013 of the benefits system, of local housing, of the insurance industry \u2013 is pretty wide, but when he thinks someone has reached the end of the bureaucratic road, he would rather tell them than dish out false hope by promising to write futile letters. Unlike many politicians, he talks to those who come to see him in exactly the same way as he speaks to, say, his special adviser; not for him the phony glottal stop.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396916880\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/9/28/1348843884245/Jack-Straw-001.jpg\" alt=\"Jack Straw\" width=\"220\" height=\"331\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack Straw enjoys a pint before he watches Blackburn Rovers.

How do you do it? I ask him afterwards. He grins. \"What? Yes. Well. I don't know.\" We look at each other for a moment. Is he lost for words? Unlikely. But the clock is ticking. If he's late for his next engagement \u2013 Blackburn Rovers are playing Barnsley and his daughter, Charlotte, is coming over from Manchester specially \u2013 there will be trouble.</p> <p>Having witnessed all this, it's not hard for me to work out how Straw has hung on to Blackburn for so long (and he intends to stand at the next election at least; the Lords, he says, is not for him). He keeps his seat toasty and warm. An altogether trickier question is how he managed to pull off the great feat of remaining in the cabinet through all 13 of the feud-ridden Blair/Brown years (the only other people to do so were Brown himself and Alastair Darling; Straw was home secretary, foreign secretary, leader of the House and, finally, justice secretary). Is the answer to be found in his new memoir? Perhaps. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781447222750\" title=\"Last Man Standing\"><em>Last Man Standing</em></a><em> </em>is a very long book \u2013 his first draft came in at a mind-boggling 200,000 words \u2013 with a careful, slightly pedantic tone that sets it somewhat apart from the bitchy memoirs of his peers. Even now his frontbench career is over, it seems, he is reluctant to fall out with people. In this sense, he is the ultimate politician.</p> <p>But his diplomacy (slippery or adroit, depending on your point of view) also has its foundations in his childhood, for it was there that he learned the shape-shifting that has been vital to his survival \u2013 and this is why, I think, his book begins with an acquaintance telling him: \"Your father has just married my mother\", rather than with, say, Tony Blair uttering the fatal words: \"I'm making you the foreign secretary.\"</p> <p>In his Blackburn kitchen, Straw pours coffee. \"I haven't talked about my childhood in detail before,\" he says. \"I don't think you should wear these things on your sleeve. For a politician, it's a bit like talking about God.\" But does he agree that it is the key to his success? He looks slightly uncomfortable. On the one hand, he clearly relishes its narrative drama. On the other, he is reluctant to admit that it is chameleons who make the best politicians. \"Um\u2026 well, you can't change your background, can you? But it has given me a facility to be\u2026 <em>at ease</em>.\"</p> <p>Straw and his four siblings grew up in a flat on an Essex council estate. His father, Walter, a conscientious objector who was jailed for his refusal to fight, was an insurance salesman. His mother, Joan, was a teacher. Their marriage was desperately unhappy. At night, Straw would lie in bed listening to the rows, the racket echoed by a neighbour below banging a broom furiously on his ceiling in a desperate effort to restore peace. His father was moody, self-pitying and socially isolated; on one occasion, his shocked son saw his protective maternal uncles beat him up, a humiliation that resulted in Walter attempting, albeit half-heartedly, to gas himself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396916881\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/9/28/1348844237413/Jack-Straw-as-a-baby-with-001.jpg\" alt=\"Jack Straw as a baby with his father, Walter\" width=\"220\" height=\"309\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack Straw as a baby with his father, Walter, who became estranged from his family.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Straw took refuge in books. He loved Anthony Buckeridge's Jennings stories and it was under their influence that he applied for, and won, a scholarship to Brentford School. (He liked school, but it took a while. He ran away repeatedly at first. There was also, later, a horrific incident in which a student in his house gassed himself; the boy believed he was gay and couldn't bear the shame of it.) In 1957, however, shortly before Straw took up his place at Brentford, his father left. He did not see him again for 10 years. Walter only came back into his life when, shortly before Straw's finals at Leeds University, an acquaintance called Reg Gratton, the editor of the student newspaper, approached him as he was on his way to the library and announced that he and Straw were now step-brothers.</p> <p>What happened after this? In <em>Last Man Standing</em>, he reveals only that he and his siblings were eventually reconciled with Walter. \"Well,\" he says. \"I got his address, I wrote to him and we arranged to meet. I told Suzy [his sister], but not the others, and I didn't tell my mother because, at that stage, you had to wash your mouth out with carbolic soap if you spoke about our father in anything other than pejorative terms.\" Was he nervous? \"I was\u2026 anxious. Then, when he picked me up at Epping station, the conversation restarted almost without him pausing for breath: he began justifying himself in relation to my mother, going on about what a hard time he'd had, how unpleasant her brothers had been. It was awful.</p> <p>\"But then the others gradually got in touch and, after a while, the relationship [with us] normalised. When he died, we all made speeches at the funeral and it was rather wonderful.\" Did he love his father? \"Yes, I loved him. I felt he was my dad and I'd always yearned for a relationship with him. But I couldn't rely on him. I was on my own. He wasn't\u2026 solid.\"</p> <p>After his finals, Straw began his political career, moving smoothly through the various ranks: president of the NUS, Islington councillor, political adviser to two cabinet ministers, Barbara Castle and then Peter Shore. Somewhere along the way, he also qualified as a barrister. Though he had been through a divorce \u2013 he and his first wife, Anthea, separated soon after they lost their daughter at six days old \u2013 he was by now happily remarried to his \"soulmate\", Alice Perkins, a high-flying civil servant, and they had a baby boy, Will. Outwardly, his life was successful, happy, on course. The boy who, aged four, stood on a chair in the kitchen and shouted: \"All peoples be quiet!\" was on his way.</p> <p>Inwardly, though, he was in turmoil \u2013 and in 1981, he fell into a deep depression. Does he believe this was connected to his childhood? \"Yes, I've no doubt about that. There were various other traumas. I'd recently lost my hearing in one ear [the result of an infection] and there was the worry I would lose the second ear, too. Meanwhile, various militants in my local party were trying to get me out. But the root of it certainly went back to my childhood. I didn't have a nervous breakdown, but I was close to one.\" How did it manifest itself? \"Bad dreams. Horrible, horrible dreams. Waking up, shouting.\"</p> <p>His mother-in-law suggested that he see a psychotherapist and for the next decade, he did, twice a week. \"It turned out to be really important. I was able to talk about things that had happened in my life that I hadn't been willing to talk about before, and to try better to understand why I had [certain] anxieties.\" In <em>Last Man Standing</em>, he writes that he suffered from \"impostor syndrome\", expecting that everything he'd achieved would inevitably be taken away from him. To me, though, he makes a different point. \"I still had the view that 96% of what had happened was my father's fault. [In therapy] I gradually came to the view that there isn't an algorithm for these things and that even if there was, what would be the point? I was luckier than most. I was able to get on in life, thanks to my mum. But part of me is my dad. I realised that I would rather have some benign views of my father than spend the rest of my life feeling contemptuous of him.\"</p> <p>Does he believe more of his colleagues should try seeing a shrink? A lot of people outside Parliament think that politicians \u2013 to use a non-psychiatric term \u2013 are mad. \"I don't think they're any madder than Jeremy Paxman or John Humphrys!\" he snorts. But then he concedes: \"At the higher levels, people's flaws come out, and some find it really difficult to cope with that, and it leads to bad behaviour by them, and they're economical with the <em>actualit\u00e9</em> or blaming other people all the time.\" Would he, I wonder, be talking about anyone in particular? According to <em>Last Man Standing</em>, John Smith was a functioning alcoholic. Blair, meanwhile, has \"cold eyes\". As for Gordon Brown, whose leadership campaign Straw agreed to manage, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/feb/21/jack-straw-plotted-against-brown\" title=\"his misgivings apparently set in early on\">his misgivings apparently set in early on</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396916882\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/9/28/1348844026924/Jack-Straw-008.jpg\" alt=\"Jack Straw\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As foreign secretary on 26 February 2003, flanked by John Prescott and Tony Blair, opening the Commons debate on military intervention in Iraq.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Why did Brown go in for so much negative briefing and why, I wonder, was no one in the party able to put a stop to it? \"Well, in retrospect, Tony should have moved him to, say, the Home Office. It was very deep in his [Brown's] psyche. I've thought about it a lot and I'm afraid it goes to his character. We all have extremes of character, but his are much wider. And he had round him bad people. He allowed them to do that stuff. It was insecurity. People who are in power who are desperate about the next step can get very neurotic. I don't want to throw the word paranoia around, but you can see people start to become fearful of others and it builds up in their heads. What gradually emerged with Gordon, which was a shock to his cabinet colleagues and the deepest trauma to him, was that he could not do the job and he has since retreated, and we don't see him. There is, sadly, no connection between an obsessive desire for a post and the ability to do it.\"</p> <p>Straw was appalled by the Browns' friendship with the former editor of the <em>Mirror</em>, Piers Morgan (it was Morgan who in 1997 telephoned Straw to tell him that his then teenage son, Will, had \"sold\" cannabis to a <em>Mirror</em> reporter). \"It is inexplicable that he got himself tied up with people like that. You deal with him on a very long spoon and you hold your nose.\"</p> <p>But Straw attended the wedding of Rebekah Wade, then the editor of the <em>Sun</em>, to Charlie Brooks. Does he regret that, too? \"It's hard, that. If I'd known then what I know now\u2026\" Naturally, I assume he's talking about phone-hacking. But, no. \"It wasn't that the <em>Sun</em> switched its support [from Labour to the Tories], it was the manner of it, which was nasty. It must have been in her mind at the time of the wedding that she was going to shaft Gordon.\"</p> <p>Did he attend because he liked Wade or because he wanted to keep her on side? \"Both. Alice was away. I was kicking my heels that evening, so I went. I liked her.\" Did he have a good time? \"I just observed the scene, which was the most extraordinarily lavish wedding I've ever been to.\"</p> <p>Straw sold the serialisation of his memoir to the<em> Daily Mail.</em> No qualms about that? \"If I had that many qualms, I would have tried to block the sale. So the answer is 'no'. I realise this is a crime before the people's court, but I've got a lot of respect for Paul Dacre. I've known him for over 40 years [he and the <em>Mail</em>'s editor were contemporaries at Leeds]. I've found him straight and he's a good journalist.\"</p> <p>And so to Iraq, though Straw is so amazingly verbose, this conversation has to take place two days later, in his Commons office. Straw's critics will say that in <em>Last Man Standing</em>, he yet again tries to have it both ways: that as foreign secretary, he backed the war, but that he also wants us to believe he was (in some other, more nuanced way) against it, at least at first. You can't hold two positions at once, I tell him. \"But I don't,\" he says, \"I was in favour of the war.\" He then launches swiftly into the usual spiel about legality, Resolution 1441, his desire to avoid a war by going through the \"UN route\" and the horror of Saddam. But isn't legality, in these kinds of conversations, a framework behind which he can hide? His book is striking for its failure to address the question in a wider moral sense \u2013 just because something is lawful doesn't make it right \u2013 though he does note that his wife, son and daughter would have been on the big anti-war march had family loyalty not been at stake.</p> <p>\"Well, it was the most serious decision I've ever had to take and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. Bear in mind what my family felt. It wasn't as though the arguments weren't being tested.\" Did you have rows? \"No, we had discussions. It was too serious to have a row about.\" I tell him that he looked unusually nervous <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/jan/21/jack-straw-chilcot-military-action-iraq\" title=\"when he appeared before the Chilcot inquiry\">when he appeared before the Chilcot inquiry</a>. \"Your interpretation is correct. It was quite an ordeal.\" Waiting for the inquiry's report must be like waiting for an exam result. \"No, it's not quite like that.\" He believes Chilcot will criticise the lack of process in cabinet and the aftermath of the war, but not, in the end, its legitimacy.</p> <p>A cause of rather more anxiety is, perhaps, that of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jun/28/libyan-dissidents-action-government-rendition\" title=\"Abdel Hakim Belhaj\">Abdel Hakim Belhaj</a>, the Libyan military commander who is suing Straw for his alleged complicity in illegal rendition and torture. But he can't say anything at all about this. \"We're in the middle of a legal process,\" he says, his hand rising to make a \"stop\" gesture. When is this process likely to be over? \"I don't know.\" He sounds cross (he has also, I notice, suddenly started using my Christian name a lot). \"You've never seen me cross!\" he says. And then: \"Look, I feel as strongly against torture as you do. It's unreliable. We discovered that in the Tower of London in the 16th century. But it's wrong anyway.\" And then: \"Are you comfortable sitting there?\"</p> <p>It's clearly time for me to push off. On the way out, we pass the office of the Conservative MP Sir Peter Tapsell who, at 82 and having served in the Commons continuously since 1966, is the father of the House. Will Straw one day succeed him? I don't know. Something may blindside him \u2013 and us \u2013 yet. But my strong hunch is that this is his latest ambition. Straw has a mania for the gym and a fetish, like Tony Blair, for clean shoes. His greatest addiction, though, is undoubtedly to the glad-handing that comes as standard in political life. I tell him that I know the way to Westminster tube station perfectly well, thanks, but he walks me there all the same \u2013 the better, I suspect, to lock eyes, just for a moment, with some poor, unsuspecting member of the electorate.</p>",
  "<p>Malcolm Muggeridge claimed when he gave up the editorship of <em>Punch</em> in 1957 that public life in our times had become so absurdly comic that it was beyond the capacity of humorists to ridicule it. Well, there's nothing in <em>The Campaign</em>, a lumpen political farce about the battle of two South Carolina Republicans to represent a congressional district in Washington DC, to match the recent antics of Romney, Ryan and the Tea Party. The film's co-producers, Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis, play respectively the&#xa0;lecherous, idiotic hypocrite defending his seat and the dimwit chosen by two rich rightwing brothers (played by John Lithgow and Dan Aykroyd and clearly based on Charles and David Koch) to oppose him. All four overact wildly.

  "<h2>Spain</h2> <p>Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy has battled for months to avoid the indignity of applying for a formal bailout from his European partners.</p> <p>With Spain much closer to the single currency's heart \u2013 both geographically and politically \u2013 than laggardly Greece, Rajoy has received plenty of support, including the promise of a \u20ac100bn injection of funds directly into the bombed-out banking sector. After <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/28/spanish-banks-stress-test-blackhole\" title=\"\">Friday's announcement of the results of an audit of the sector revealed a \u20ac60bn black hole</a>, those funds will be essential.</p> <p>But with borrowing costs for Spain climbing close to the 6% level that has repeatedly signalled danger throughout the crisis, most euro-watchers expect Rajoy to be forced to accept a package of aid, along with the strict list of terms and conditions that would imply.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Moody's is expected to deliver its verdict on Spain's sovereign debt rating in the coming days, and a downgrade could just be the catalyst the markets need to drive up Madrid's borrowing costs to dangerous levels.</p> <p>Last week's Spanish budget, which contained numerous new spending cuts and reform measures and won the approval of the European commission, was widely seen as a bid to pre-empt any extra austerity measures that Spain's creditors might be likely to impose.</p> <p>A bailout would allow European Central Bank president Mario Draghi to deploy his \"outright monetary transactions\" and make unlimited purchases of Spain's bonds. But going cap in hand to the troika \u2013 the ECB, European commission and International Monetary Fund \u2013 would still be a deep political humiliation for Rajoy, at a time when Spain's regional leaders are jockeying for independence and sky-high unemployment of more than 25% is imposing an excruciating cost on the population.</p> <p>Even if Rajoy can drive through the measures needed to secure a bailout in the face of mass public opposition, hold the Spanish state together despite growing separatist sentiment and rebuild the country's battered banks, the road back to prosperity looks like a long, hard one \u2013 and that's already a lot of ifs.</p> <h2>Greece</h2> <p>Rumour has it in Brussels that eurozone politicians have sworn not to push Greece out until after Barack Obama is safely back in the White House. But few analysts believe it has a long-term future in the single currency.</p> <p>After fraught negotiations that stretched on all summer, the coalition government, led by Antonis Samaras, appeared last week to have reached agreement on a new package of cuts, which it hopes will satisfy the demands of the troika.</p> <p>But Greece's economy remains in a wrenching recession, and it looks likely they will continue to miss the goals set by international lenders, even if the next \u20ac31bn (\u00a324.7bn) disbursement from its bailout fund is released. Eventually, Greece's partners may decide to let it go \u2013 especially if they believe they have elected a solid firewall that would prevent a \"Grexit\", as it's known, creating a devastating chain reaction in financial markets.</p> <p>And Greece could yet decide to leave of its own accord, if domestic political pressure becomes too intense. With Samaras elected on a promise he would exact concessions from the country's creditors, the political reaction to a fresh round of cuts from a population already scarred by the downturn is likely to be furious. Protesters threw Molotov cocktails at riot police at a protest during last week's general strike, the latest of many as the workforce has endured cuts in benefits, wages, pensions and public services to meet the troika's deficit targets.</p> <p>In theory, the \"internal devaluation\" Greece is going through is aimed at making the country's goods more competitive on world markets by cutting the cost of production. But there is little sign that growth is about to be restored.</p> <p>\"If you look at what Greece is going through, it's comparable with the Great Depression,\" says Dario Perkins of Lombard Street Research, pointing out that economic output has already plunged an extraordinary 20% since the start of the crisis. \"The US Great Depression didn't end because of austerity, it ended because they left the gold standard and they had a massive devaluation, and because fiscal policy was moving in the right direction.\"</p> <h2>Hardliners</h2> <p>One of the things that most alarmed Europe's financial markets last week was the outcome of an obscure meeting in Helsinki that suggested the single currency's paymasters have decided to play hardball.</p> <p>Finance ministers from the Netherlands, Germany and Finland \u2013 the eurozone's paymasters, and also its most hardline members \u2013 gathered for talks in the Finnish capital and issued a statement clarifying the eurozone rescue deal that was reached after make-or-break talks in June.</p> <p>At the time, the agreement appeared to mark a positive departure in the crisis, helping to sever the connection between the balance sheets of sickly banks and the finances of states. It was agreed \u2013 or so it appeared \u2013 that the eurozone bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), would be allowed to inject money directly into ailing banks in eurozone countries.</p> <p>That would prevent their governments from having to apply for a full-blown bailout, with all the attendant misery of troika inspections, and halt the vicious circle in which bank bailouts shift losses onto the public finances and weaken public finances by depressing the value of the government bonds that are the banks' main source of capital.</p> <p>However, after last week's discussions in Helsinki, the canny northern Europeans spelt out their conditions. Before the ESM can bail out banks, they insisted that the eurozone-wide banking union must be \"established\" and its \"effectiveness\u2026 determined\" \u2013 which is a tough hurdle, since the plan so far remains a glint in Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso's eye.</p> <p>More importantly, they insisted that \"legacy assets\" \u2013 that is, all the dodgy loans from the credit crisis era, must remain \"the responsibility of national authorities\".</p> <p>At a stroke, they seemed to dash Ireland's hopes of receiving help from its eurozone neighbours for the cost of its massive banking bailout and undermine Spain's hopes of repairing its financial sector without Madrid going cap in hand to the troika.</p> <p>But most damagingly, the announcement from Helsinki underlined the fact that, in the long-running eurozone crisis, the devil is always in the detail.</p> <h2>Italy</h2> <p>With Spain still firmly in the markets' crosshairs, Italy's moment of danger appeared to have passed, at least for the time being. But after 30,000 strikers forced the closure of the Colosseum on Friday as they marched in Rome against the government's public sector cuts, political support for austerity in the eurozone's third-largest economy is looking increasingly fragile.</p> <p>A year into a deep recession, the technocratic prime minister Mario Monti, installed last November after intense pressure from the markets and eurozone politicians helped force Silvio Berlusconi out of office, is struggling to meet his budget goals. His support is also fading \u2013 though he said last week that he might agree to stay on if elections, due to be held in the spring, failed to yield a definitive result. He has acknowledged the concerns of protesters, saying his austerity policies have subjected the public to an \"unprecedented amount of sacrifices\".</p> <p>When the ECB president Mario Draghi announced his policy of \"outright monetary transactions\" \u2013 or OMT \u2013 the expectation in financial markets was that Italy would follow Spain in asking for an official EU bailout so that it could benefit from the scheme, which is designed to bring down weaker governments' borrowing costs by buying their bonds.</p> <p>But that would be a severe political humiliation \u2013 and, what's worse, it is not even clear that Europe has the money. As Karen Guinand of the bank Lombard Odier put it in a research note last week: \"If and when Spain does appeal for help, another problem will then emerge: much of the EFSF/ESM [bailout fund] resources would probably be used up \u2026 leaving little for&#xa0;Italy.\"</p> <p>Once a Spanish bailout happens \u2013 and most analysts now believe it is a case of when, not if \u2013 attention will inevitably turn to Italy, just as the country gears up for a general election in which Berlusconi and his supporters are expected to run on an anti-euro ticket. The former prime minister last week <a href=\"http://euobserver.com/political/117689\" title=\"\">described the single currency as a \"big swindle\"</a>; staying inside the euro will require more painful sacrifices, and Italians may decide that they have had enough.</p> <h2>Growth</h2> <p>Even if all the other pieces fall into place \u2013 the Spanish bailout, the latest tranche of the Greek rescue, Mario Draghi's bond-buying splurge \u2013 there remains the question of whether the widely diverging fortunes of the eurozone's economies can be brought closer together.</p> <p>Europe's statistical agency, Eurostat, expects the eurozone economy to contract by 0.3% in 2012, and expand by a paltry 1% next year.</p> <p>But that average disguises a sharp divide: while the powerhouse of Germany continues to expand \u2013 though at a less healthy pace than in the last 12 months \u2013 much of the rest of the single currency area is trapped in a deep recession, unable to compete with the wealthy economies of the north, where, certainly in Germany's case, falling real wages over a number of years have created a super-competitive manufacturing sector.</p> <p>\"The bigger issue for us always is: does any of this address the underlying problems?\" says Jonathan Loynes, European economist at Capital&#xa0;Economics.</p> <p>\"Even if the ECB comes out with all guns blazing, all it's doing is dealing with one of the symptoms: it's not reducing anyone's debts.\"</p> <p>He fears that while Europe's politicians may be able to paper over the cracks with emergency bailouts in the short term, voters in Germany and the other \"core\" economies in the currency bloc may not be willing to countenance the large-scale financial transfers that would be necessary if Greece, Portugal and Spain were to be brought up to speed with the rest of the eurozone.</p> <p>Dario Perkins of Lombard Street Research warns that public opinion in all the struggling economies \u2013 Portugal, Greece, Spain and Italy \u2013 is likely to become increasingly impatient if the universally prescribed recipe of austerity fails to improve people's lives. \"You can't continue with no growth indefinitely: these are democracies.\"</p>",
  "<p>On 5 October 1962, a new sound filled the nation's airwaves. It was raw, simple, direct and sexy. \"Love, love me do,\" sang Lennon and McCartney, \"You know I love you.\" The Beatles had arrived, and a new generation had a new soundtrack to their lives. Seventeen years after VE Day and VJ Day, the war was finally over. Nothing \u2013 in culture, in society, in the everyday world itself \u2013 would ever be quite the same again.</p> <p>When, exactly, did the 1960s began? Was it when JFK announced he was running for president (31 January 1960)? When Harold Macmillan acknowledged \"the winds of change\" sweeping through colonial Africa (3 February)? Or when the chain-smoking Princess Margaret announced her engagement to a commoner, photographer Anthony Armstrong-Jones, on 26 February? Or was it when Kennedy finally won the US election, by a whisker, on 9 November?</p> <p>Some would go further, and deny that any kind of transition occurred until the new American president had, thrillingly, been sworn in on the icy-blue morning of 20 January 1961. Until then, they say, the west was still in the grip of the sclerotic gerontocracy represented by Eisenhower and Khrushchev. One thing is certain: the 1950s took a while to pass into the limbo of lost time.</p> <p>In our reckoning with the past, never underestimate the potency of a really good line. For Philip Larkin, the \"annus mirabilis\" that would confirm his discovery of sexual intercourse, and thereby launch the new decade, famously fell (\"rather late for me\") between \"the end of the Chatterley ban and the Beatles' first LP\". Ever since Larkin, it has become commonplace to suggest that the 60s only struggled out of bed to face the world as late as 1963.</p> <p>Really? The joyless columns of the almanac contain persuasive evidence that the 60s actually kicked off in October 1962. In the US, for instance, Monday 1 October was the day the first black student, James Meredith, enrolled in the previously all-white University of Mississippi. Civil rights activists were on the move. This was the month that became a hinge between the pinched grey days of the 50s and the Technicolor decade to come.</p> <p>We are, in other words, about to celebrate the 50th anniversary of a neglected moment when the baby boomers came bursting through the heavily policed doorway of a diminished present into the gaudy playground of the near future. Even before October, 1962 was shaping up nicely as the dawn of a new decade.</p> <p>In January the first Beatles recording, a song entitled My Bonnie, credited to Tony Sheridan and the Beat Brothers, was released by Polydor. In February the US put an astronaut into orbit for the first time, when John Glenn was launched from Cape Canaveral on Friendship 7. After three circuits of the Earth, Glenn splashed down in the Atlantic. The race for the moon \u2013 a defining 60s challenge \u2013 had begun.</p> <p>On 7 April, in a footnote to the phenomenon not yet known as \"popular culture\", a certain Brian Jones was introduced to two young musicians, Michael Philip (\"Mick\") Jagger and Keith Richards, at a jazz club in Ealing, west London. They formed their band, the Rolling Stones, later that year. <a href=\"http://www.rollingstones.com/crossfire-hurricane/\" title=\"\">A documentary to be shown</a> at next month's London film festival is dedicated to what happened next.</p> <p>On 16 April, there was more music for the ages: folk singer Bob Dylan, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/mar/18/bob-dylan-debut-1962-anniversary\" title=\"\">who had recently released his debut album</a>, first performed Blowin' in the Wind in a club on West 4th Street, New York City. Meanwhile, on 14&#xa0;June, <em>Steptoe and Son</em> began a 12-year run on BBC TV where it became, in the words of one critic, \"the most popular situation comedy in British television history\".</p> <p>1962 was also a crucial year in the politics of the cold war. In June, the second phase of building the Berlin Wall began. In the months that followed, several East German escapees perished in no man's land, a killing ground of landmines and barbed wire.</p> <p>Marilyn Monroe was on 5 August found dead in her bed in Los Angeles, from an overdose of Nembutal. The following day, Nelson Mandela was arrested in South Africa; he would later be convicted of sabotage and, having narrowly escaped the gallows, given a life sentence.</p> <p>Autumn rolled in, and the 60s arrived with the sound of a bluesy \"dockside harmonica\", and a hint of sadomasochism: the launch of Love Me Do and the UK premiere of the first James Bond movie, <em>Dr No</em>, on the same day, Friday 5 October. The Beatles' raw working-class candour, mixed with Lennon's riff, went into the nation's teenage bloodstream like a drug.</p> <p>Overnight, it seemed, there was a new style, language, and rhythm, adding up to a new repertoire of private, personal possibility. The contraceptive pill (on sale in the UK from January 1961) was liberating sex from the joyless tyranny of the condom. The 50s \"gramophone\" was becoming the 60s \"record-player\". Suddenly the hunt was on, in the words of Lennon and McCartney, for \"someone to love, somebody new\".</p> <p>Time flows like a broad river, but history comes in strange eddies and sudden torrents. The prime minister of the day, Harold Macmillan, was once asked about the most likely threat to his government's stability. \"Events, dear boy, events,\" murmured the languid Old Etonian. The credits had hardly rolled on <em>Dr No</em>, and Love Me Do had scarcely begun its climb into the lower reaches of the Top 20, before October 1962 became dominated by two events that would shape the decades to come.</p> <p>On 11 October,<strong> </strong>Pope John XXIII opened the Second Vatican Council, popularly known as Vatican II, and the inspiration for Tom Lehrer's celebrated satirical song, The Vatican Rag.</p> <p>More importantly, it started a process of church liberalisation and sponsored within the Catholic church a reconsideration of marital relations and sexuality. The aftershocks of these debates continue to reverberate through the conservative papacy of Pope Benedict XVI. The issues confronted by Vatican II remain as central to Catholicism as, in international relations, nuclear weapons do to the peace of the earth.</p> <p>In superpower politics, 1962 remains the archetypal postwar year. On 14&#xa0;October, the day after the Broadway premiere of Edward Albee's <em>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</em> (which placed another ancient institution \u2013 marriage \u2013 under the spotlight), a US spy plane photographed four mobile Soviet nuclear missile launchers in western Cuba. On 22 October, Kennedy broadcast that \"unmistakable evidence has established the fact that a series of offensive missile sites\" had been established in Cuba by the Soviet Union \"to provide a nuclear strike capability against the western hemisphere\". He went on: \"I call upon Chairman Khrushchev to halt and eliminate this clandestine, reckless and provocative threat to world peace.\" The world held its breath. Was this Armageddon? After the missile crisis, the fate of the earth crystallised progressive thinking on the left. The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, founded in 1957, acquired a new purpose. The Aldermaston march, the CND symbol and its slogan \"Ban the Bomb\" became an integral part of the youth culture of the 1960s, shaping Labour party policy long into the 1980s.</p> <p>On 28 October, after days of intolerable suspense, Moscow radio broadcast Khrushchev's response, \"the discontinuation of further work on weapons construction sites\". As Khrushchev promised \"to dismantle the arms, to crate and return them to the Soviet Union\", the freighters carrying the missiles turned back mid-ocean. In this terrifying standoff, it was said that the Russians had \"blinked\".</p> <p>Slowly, life returned to some kind of normality, with seeds for the future, too. On 3 November, the <em>New York Times</em> made the first reference in print to the miracle machine known as the \"personal computer\". A few days later, on 7 November, an angry Richard Nixon, defeated in the race for governor of California, told reporters: \"You won't have Nixon to kick around any more, because, gentlemen, this is my last press conference.\" If only. On the same day, Khrushchev announced that the withdrawal of Soviet missiles from Cuba was complete.</p> <p>In the UK, watching the world crisis from the sidelines, jokes were another weapon: the 60s satire boom was about to explode. On 25 November, the first episode of <em>That Was the Week That Was </em>aired on BBC TV, raising the domestic blood pressure of Tunbridge Wells.</p> <p>While Britain became accustomed to its role as an attendant lord on the world stage, it was former US secretary of state Dean Acheson who, on 5 December, delivered a brutal critique of our ambitions to play the lead. \"Great Britain has lost an empire and has not yet found a role,\" said Acheson. \"The attempt to play a separate power role \u2026 is absolutely played out.\"</p> <p>None of this would discourage the empire dreams that would animate many crucial moments in \"the 60s\". David Lean's epic <em>Lawrence of Arabia</em> had its worldwide premiere in London on 10 December. A more dystopian worldview was expressed in Anthony Burgess's <em>A Clockwork Orange</em>, published just before the end of the year.</p> <p>Whatever the decade, there's always the weather. On 22 December the \"big freeze\" gripped the country in an iron fist and didn't let go until March. In this bleak midwinter, Sylvia Plath saw her pseudonymous novel <em>The Bell Jar</em> fall stillborn from the press, completed her <em>Ariel</em> poems, wrote a last letter to Ted Hughes, and put her head in the gas oven. Larkin's \"annus mirabilis\" had begun. But that's another story.</p> <p>Looking back, 1962 now seems to be the fascinating antechamber to the great party that was the 60s. But it's also a time capsule. Here are issues \u2013 civil rights nuclear disarmament, radical feminism, the dystopian imagination, secularisation \u2013 with which we are still grappling. But then the world was young \u2013 Lennon was about to turn 22, McCartney was just 20 \u2013 and Love Me Do, three words, two basic chords and a pocket harmonica, could change the hearts and minds of a generation.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 4 October 2012 to correctly identify former Secretary of State Dean Acheson as the speechmaker who said \"Great Britain has lost an empire and has not yet found a role\", not Dean Rusk.</p>",
  "<p>In some ways, it is just like old times. Huge crowds mob the presidential candidate as he swings through dusty villages and towns promising a new Venezuela. They surround his bus, chanting his name, and when he emerges they scream and surge forward, desperate to embrace him. Many clutch notes \u2013 handwritten pleas for a job, a house, an operation \u2013 and if they manage to slip them into his hands or pockets they near explode with joy. \"He knows things can't go on like this. He knows we're ready for a change,\" Josmir Meza, 25, a student, shouted over cheers.</p> <p>The trouble for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/hugo-chavez\" title=\"\">Hugo Ch\u00e1vez</a> is that he is no longer that candidate. In 1998, he was an insurgent outsider, a young, athletic campaigner who promised to overthrow the established order and \"refound\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/venezuela\" title=\"\">Venezuela</a>. He was unstoppable and roared to victory.</p> <p>Fourteen years later, however, as he seeks a third term in next Sunday's election, it his youthful challenger, <a href=\"http://www.newint.org/blog/2012/09/25/venezuela-elections-capriles-chavez/\" title=\"\">Henrique Capriles</a>, 40, who electrifies the crowds.</p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez, 58, in contrast, is an ailing, elusive figure who now represents the establishment. He wishes not to storm the presidential palace, Miraflores, a pink, neocolonial spread in downtown Caracas, but to keep it. Having dominated Venezuela like a colossus, leading his socialist revolution to consecutive electoral landslides, he is facing the electoral fight of his life.</p> <p>With both sides depicting the vote as an existential test to vanquish or save the unique political and economic experiment known as chavismo, the stakes could scarcely be higher. If Ch\u00e1vez loses, his movement will almost certainly fracture, dismaying foreign supporters who hailed the \"<a href=\"http://worldnews.about.com/od/venezuela/f/bolivarianrevolution.htm\" title=\"\">Bolivarian revolution</a>\" as a leftwing showcase. If he wins, critics at home and abroad will warn of a slide into autocracy and dysfunction.</p> <p>Either way, it will be another chapter in the great drama that is the life of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. How a boy from a humble family in Sabaneta, a speck of a town on the vast grasslands known as <em>los llanos</em> rose to become not just president but a global figure simultaneously adored and reviled is a remarkable tale.</p> <p>Like the fireside legends of horsemen, demons and rebels that so enchanted the young Hugo \u2013 he memorised the poems, stories and songs \u2013 his rise is the stuff of myth. He was the second son of schoolteacher parents; if a girl, they planned to call him Eva (Venezuela's version of Eve), complementing the firstborn who was called Adan (Adam), but instead named him after his father. As more children arrived (six, all boys), the two eldest were sent to live with their grandmother, Rosa, a kind, industrious woman who doted on the boys.</p> <p>Hugo was by all accounts a happy, chatty boy who when not at school played baseball with a homemade bat and ball, painted, read books and supplemented household income selling his grandmother's \"spiders\", sugar-coated papaya strips. \"I would go round shouting, 'Hot spiders, tasty spiders for pretty girls!'\" he recalled recently. As a skinny teenager with big feet he was nicknamed Goofy.</p> <p>By the 1960s, Venezuela, once a sleepy corner of South America ruled by dictators, was a fledgling democracy with growing oil revenues and hunger for modernity. A new elite and middle class grew amid the skyscrapers but most rural migrants ended up in hillside shacks around cities.</p> <p>Hugo, a talented baseball player, dreamed not of politics but pitching for the major leagues. He became a military cadet hoping to vault from the academy to baseball clubs in Caracas. Instead, he fell in love with soldiering. \"A uniform, a gun, an area, close-order formation, marches, morning runs, studies in military science \u2013 I was like a fish in water,\" he recalled later.</p> <p>As Ch\u00e1vez moved up the ranks, he studied the writings of <a href=\"http://www.embavenez-us.org/kids.venezuela/simon.bolivar.htm\" title=\"\">Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar</a>, the 19th-century liberator who ousted the Spanish, as well as philosophers such as Nietzsche and Plekhanov. He also noted extreme poverty and inequality amid the oil boom. Inspired by revolutionary military leaders in Panama and Peru, and leftwing Venezuelan intellectuals, an idea began to form: revolt.</p> <p>Over a decade, he gathered fellow officers into a conspiracy to replace what they saw as a venal, sham democracy with a progressive, real democracy. The February 1992 coup was a military fiasco, letting the unpopular government survive, but Ch\u00e1vez turned his televised surrender address into a political triumph. Eloquent and dashing in his red beret, he introduced himself to a startled nation \u2013 \"listen to comandante Ch\u00e1vez\" \u2013 and said his objectives had not been met \"por ahora\", for now. He deserved 30 years in jail, went the joke: one for the coup, 29 for failing.</p> <p>Pardoned and released after two years, he was adopted as a figurehead by a coalition of grassroots movements and leftwing parties and stormed to victory in the 1998 election, cheered not only by the poor but a middle class fed up with ossified political parties. With a barrel of oil just $8, the petro-state was near broke.</p> <p>Few outside Venezuela, until then best known for beauty queens and oil, knew what to make of this mercurial arrival who praised Fidel Castro but said he was neither left nor right but seeker of a Blairesqe \"third way\". Within a few short years, Ch\u00e1vez became one of the world's most recognisable and polarising figures.</p> <p>Vehement rhetoric \u2013 he railed against the wealthy as \"squealing pigs\" and \"vampires\" who looted oil wealth \u2013 endeared him to the poor and alienated the middle class and traditional elites. They called him a monkey and worse. In April 2002, the elites briefly ousted him in a Bush administration-backed coup, tried again with an oil strike, then a recall referendum. Ch\u00e1vez survived and grew more radical, declaring himself a socialist and nationalising swaths of the economy. Soaring oil prices gushed billions into the treasury, which he used to fund Cuban-run health clinics and other social programmes, easing poverty. He created a state media empire that promoted a personality cult and tightened executive control over the armed forces, the judiciary and the legislature.</p> <p>He called George Bush a \"donkey\", \"Mr Danger\", \"an asshole\" and, during a memorable UN speech, \"the devil\". Supporters such as Ken Livingstone, Sean Penn, Danny Glover and Noam Chomsky paid homage in visits to Caracas. After winning a second term in 2006, Ch\u00e1vez won a referendum abolishing term limits and talked of ruling until 2021, then 2030. That looks fanciful now. Ahead in some polls, he trails in others.</p> <p>He remains revered in the barrios. \"He is a gift, he means everything to us,\" said Aleira Quintero, 55, a red T-shirted canvasser in Petare. But even supporters are fed up with horrific crime rates, inflation, shortages and crumbling infrastructure. Bridges collapse, refineries blow up, blackouts shroud cities.</p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez has proved a shrewd political strategist and inspired communicator but disastrous manager, warping the economy with contradictory controls, creating and dissolving ministries by caprice, launching and abandoning initiatives, neglecting investment and maintenance. Despite record oil revenues, Venezuela is borrowing billions to try to plug the holes.</p> <p>Charisma, giveaways and institutional control, not least the ability to monopolise the airwaves, could yet clinch re-election but Chavez faces two formidable obstacles.</p> <p>Drained and bloated by cancer treatment, he sometimes has trouble walking. Instead of the barnstorming of old, his public appearances are few and often melancholic. \"If it were up to me, you know I'd get down off this stage and I'd go walking, as in times past,\" he told a rally, tears in his eyes. Some supporters fear the cancer is terminal and that a vote for Ch\u00e1vez is a vote for uncertainty and power-grabs by unloved ministers and courtiers.</p> <p>The other obstacle is Capriles. Unlike previous inept, shrill opposition leaders, the state governor is a disciplined, energetic campaigner. A jogger and basketball player, his nickname is El Flaquito, the skinny one. He has seized the initiative by crisscrossing the country, visiting 274 towns, and casting himself as a centrist who will keep Ch\u00e1vez's social programmes while offering competent administration. To woo \"soft chavistas\" he does not call Ch\u00e1vez a dictator or even Ch\u00e1vez. Conscious of the name's power, Capriles calls him \"the candidate of the (ruling party) PSUV\".</p> <p>Whether the president wins or not \u2013 and given his electoral track record you would be foolish or brave to bet against him \u2013 his fame will live on. In or out of power, there will be no forgetting the name Hugo Ch\u00e1vez.</p>",
  "<p>Call it the \"close your eyes test\". The challenge faces every leader of the opposition. Whether or not they pass is invariably crucial to their eventual success or failure. Can voters close their eyes and imagine this person standing on the threshold of Number 10 telling the country that Her Majesty has just invited them to form a government? So when Toby Helm, our political editor, and I went to interview Ed Miliband for today's <em>Observer</em>, I asked the Labour leader whether he thought people saw him as a future prime minister. After a pause, he replied: \"Well, that's for them to decide\", a response that did not ooze confidence.</p> <p>His aides protest that it is always hard to look prime ministerial until you are actually prime minister and some of his personal ratings are at least heading in the right direction as voters and commentators, some of whom originally and foolishly wrote him off as a Labour version of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/iain-duncan-smith\" title=\"\">Iain Duncan Smith</a>, reassess his qualities. Though still negative, his net approval rating on the <a href=\"http://yougov.co.uk/\" title=\"\">YouGov</a> tracker has improved 31 points since mid-January while David Cameron has slumped by 25. \"The more people get to see of Ed, the more they like him,\" says one of his senior staff, though it could be that the converse is the more important dynamic: the more people see of David Cameron, the less they like him.</p> <p>People may be warming to the Labour leader, but when asked whether he looks prime ministerial, the answer from our opinion poll today is a big, rude raspberry. On several of the key qualities that voters look for in a leader, he is rated very poorly. Only 28% of respondents can imagine him as prime minister; 63% cannot. That is a bad fail of the \"close your eyes test\".</p> <p>This encourages Tories to believe that, for all the difficulties of the coalition and despite the severe decline in their man's personal ratings, they can win the next election by making it as presidential as possible. Their plan is to try to brand the Labour leader as too weird and too left wing to put inside Number 10. In some ways, as he remarks in our interview, this is rather flattering. Tory propagandists would not be personally targeting him if they did not take the idea of Prime Minister Miliband seriously. You also have to wonder what leaking their scheme says about their judgment. If you plan a surprise attack it is usually thought best to, well, keep it a surprise. Personal campaigns against opponents have a record of backfiring because voters decide it says more about the nastiness of those doing the attacking than it does about the object of the attack. Mr Miliband might also take some encouragement from the fact that previous Tory efforts to define him negatively have not been terribly effective. The \"Red Ed\" tag that they tried to stick to him when he first became leader never really caught on.</p> <p>That said, important members of the shadow cabinet think he would be unwise to be complacent. Mr Miliband is just about old enough to remember how the Tories, in co-ordination with the right-wing tabloids, turned the public images of <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/book-review--how-worzel-came-to-save-the-labour-party-michael-foot--mervyn-jones-victor-gollancz-20-pounds-1369303.html\" title=\"\">Michael Foot</a> and <a href=\"http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=171485&amp;sectioncode=5\" title=\"\">Neil Kinnock </a>into Worzel Gummidge and the Welsh Windbag. Tabloid power has been diluted by the growth of new media, but ferocious press attacks can still have a destabilising, demoralising and debilitating effect.</p> <p>The Labour leader is additionally vulnerable because to much of the electorate he is still largely a blank canvas. Some voters may be aware that he is the son of Jewish refugees from the Nazis, a story he has often told. There was that bit of confusion about whether or not he was going to get married and, for many voters, that and beating his brother is probably the sum total of their knowledge about the man who would be their next prime minister. How to convey his personality to the public has been intensely preoccupying his circle in the run-up to his conference speech. There are certain things he can do nothing about. As he has said himself, if you asked spin doctors to design the perfect leadership candidate, they would not come up with Ed Miliband. Image-makers would probably describe something like Mitt Romney, which goes to show that having presidential teeth and hair is not the same as being presidential.</p> <p>The Labour leader cannot help coming over as agreeable, idealistic, a bit pointy headed and rather earnest, because that is what he is. Much of his summer holiday on a Greek island was spent reading books of social and economic theory. He has invited an American political philosopher, <a href=\"http://www.gov.harvard.edu/people/faculty/michael-sandel\" title=\"\">Michael Sandel</a>, to address the conference. He will never be convincing as the blokey candidate with whom you'd most like to share a pint. He is a career-long member of the professional political class. He read PPE at Oxford, worked with me on a politics programme on Channel 4, landed a job as a special adviser, took a sabbatical at Harvard when working with Gordon Brown and Ed Balls became just too much, returned to Britain to be guided into a safe seat and not long after was in the cabinet.</p> <p>True enough, the state educated him, in Leeds and then at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/aug/02/haverstock-school-labour-leaders-eton\" title=\"\">Haverstock comprehensive</a> in north London, a contrast with David Cameron that I expect to be highlighted in his speech. But in its way his childhood was as rarefied as that of the Tory leader. Not many people grow up in a household in which the most famous intellectuals of the left gather around the kitchen table. He cannot claim to be another Abe Lincoln, rising to greatness from log cabin poverty. In a nice irony, thanks to the London property boom, the Miliband brothers inherited a tidy windfall from their Marxist father.</p> <p>The sort of stunts performed by previous leaders of the opposition \u2013 Tony Blair doing headers with Kevin Keegan, David Cameron riding with huskies in the Arctic Circle \u2013 won't work for him. We are now familiar enough with such manipulations to have become suspicious of them and anyway there would be a high risk of him looking like a prat. So his best bet is to attempt to flip the flaws in his image into an advantage. The earnestness and wonkishness at least suggest an authenticity that might be contrasted with the sort of slickeries practised by David Cameron en route to power.</p> <p>And there are things that he can do something about. One is to make speeches in plainer English. His interest in ideas is an attractive quality, but when he rises to speak on Tuesday it will be essential that he does not talk as though he were addressing a thinktank. Concepts such as \"predistribution\" are stimulating, even potentially popular if turned into practical policies. This year's speech, like last year's, will focus heavily on \"responsible capitalism\", but it will only win him a hearing among mainstream voters if it is expressed in clear, engaging and populist language. Mrs Thatcher read Hayek, but she did not often quote him when she was trying to get votes. She instead told audiences that she would sell them their council houses.</p> <p>What should most worry Mr Miliband is how few voters think he is capable of making a tough decision. I am sure he would protest that this is not fair. Did he not stand against his own brother for the leadership? Did he not show cojones when he led the condemnation of Rupert Murdoch? And now, in our interview, he issues a drastic ultimatum to the banks. The public is not convinced. Just 14% of the respondents to our poll rate him \"able to take tough decisions\". That could be in part because they sense that he picks relatively easy targets. No one in the Labour party is going to be upset when their leader attacks News Corp or the City. One way to go about persuading the electorate that he is steely enough for the job would be to pick some battles with his party, but he has rejected that Blair model of how to define your leadership. We have yet to see in him a capacity to challenge labour's ideological comfort zones or to take an unpopular position because he believed it to be right.</p> <p>This weakness matters greatly because it is closely enmeshed with whether voters will be prepared to trust the nation's finances to Labour. Mr Miliband can say that he recognises that a Labour government would have to operate under tight fiscal restraints. To convince the voters that he means it, they really have to believe that, when Prime Minister Miliband is confronted by unexpected crises, protesting crowds, demanding trade unions or stroppy colleagues, his first instinct will not be to deal with problems by throwing at them money that the country does not have.</p> <p>He has passed some of the early tests of being leader of the opposition and done so more effectively than critics and even some friends expected when he first became Labour leader. Now comes the challenge of persuading the country that he could be its next leader. By the end of his speech, he needs more people to be able to close their eyes and think of Prime Minister Miliband. It would help if they quite liked the idea too.</p>",
  "<p>Venezuela is gearing up for its closest presidential poll in more than a decade. The revolutionary incumbent, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, is battling cancer and fighting for his political life. A telegenic young challenger from the centre-right, Henrique Capriles, is gaining ground. With one week left, one voter \u2013 the hatmaker of Caracas \u2013 weighs up the options.</p> <p>For half a century Juan Torres has provided hats for Venezuela's heads of state. Earning little more than the minimum wage, he shaped the panama owned by the \"father of democracy\", R\u00f3mulo Betancourt, when he took power in 1958, the borsalino of the centrist leader J\u00f3vito Villalba, and the stetson donned by Luis Herrera Camp\u00edns, who presided over an era of economic decline in the early 1980s.</p> <p>Now he is watching with a professional eye as a nation decides whether the revolutionary red beret that has been the trademark of Ch\u00e1vez, 58, during his 14 years in power will be replaced by the baseball cap of Capriles.</p> <p>With just a week until polling day, most forecasters predict a narrow victory of between three and five points for the incumbent. But the gap has been closing, with many voters undecided and the huge turnouts for opposition rallies providing more momentum for Capriles, who is 40, than many analysts would have believed possible.</p> <p>In this politically polarised nation, there is no doubt which side of the divide Torres is from. His neighbourhood is 23 de Enero, a bastion of Ch\u00e1vez supporters. In next week's poll, the president will cast his vote alongside local residents here in the Manuel Pelacios Fajardo school. Electoral banners and graffiti are everywhere \u2013 all in favour of the incumbent: the words \"100% Ch\u00e1vez\" are daubed on countless car windows. \"Ch\u00e1vez: Heart of the Fatherland\" read the posters that are fixed to every lamppost.</p> <p>Although this is one of the president's strongholds, there is ambivalence: a mix of appreciation, frustration and anxiety that reflects not only many of the reasons why Ch\u00e1vez has held on to power but also why the vote on 7&#xa0;October is likely to be closer than any other since he first won in 1998.</p> <p>Torres and his son, Jon\u00e1s, escort us through the neighbourhood, pointing out some of the benefits they say Ch\u00e1vez has brought to local people during that time: a clinic staffed by Cuban doctors, a public bus service and a new school where the walls have already been painted with a slogan, \"Socialist Anti-Imperialist Commune\".</p> <p>Local collectives have been given considerable power, including the authority to initiate projects and bid for central government funds. Memphis Paris, the representative of a group of 5,200 residents called Three Roots Collective, said his group had been given money to improve plumbing in the tower blocks and a playground with exercise machines overlooking the valley.</p> <p>At first glance the improvements look modest at best, particularly given that Venezuela is one of the world's three biggest oil producers and Ch\u00e1vez's presidency has been marked by a surge in the price of crude from $9 (\u00a35.50) a barrel to more than $100 today. The country's state-run oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA), has generated revenues of more than $980bn.</p> <p>Critics say Ch\u00e1vez has squandered this income with programmes aimed at buying off the electorate, while supporters say the money has been used for a long-overdue redistribution of income.</p> <p>The government has spent almost $300bn on social programmes that aim to improve literacy, high school education, accommodation for the homeless, and to provide subsidies for groceries or affordable home appliances. Partly as a result, poverty levels have decreased. Unemployment has fallen from 13% in 1999 to just over 8%. Infant mortality has almost halved.</p> <p>Torres's shop is in a central district of Caracas that the government has made the flagship of efforts to revitalise the city. Public squares are being cleared for music concerts, dilapidated theatres and buildings are being renovated. The British architect Richard Rogers, who was introduced to Ch\u00e1vez officials by Ken Livingstone, has designed a new central bus terminal.</p> <p>But many voters complain that many ideas are never implemented because of corruption and inefficiency. Oil production has fallen due to poor maintenance and weak investment, the road system is dire, crime is rampant and social campaigns have petered out.</p> <p>Torres says the government earmarked funds to improve the facades on buildings in his neighbourhood, but the money never reached the local community. \"I think Ch\u00e1vez has good ideas, but the people around him have failed to carry them out. I'm disappointed. They are serving their own interests, not the revolution,\" he says.</p> <p>Venezuela's economy has grown on average by 2.8% between 1999 and 2011. It's been outperformed by neighbouring Colombia, Brazil and Chile, none of which have enjoyed the windfall from oil. Inflation for 1999-2010 grew 961%, more than 10 times the average of the other seven larger economies in Latin America.</p> <p>An overdependence on oil exports and failed currency controls have created a huge black market for dollars. Torres stopped making hats himself a couple of years ago because it was cheaper to import and sell them. He earns the minimum wage, plus commission. \"Business has been bad this year. I hope it settles after the election,\" he says. \"What we need is economic change.\"</p> <p>The lack of dynamism is evident. Most of the buildings and vehicles in his neighbourhood look dilapidated. The national murder rate has more than doubled in the last 10 years, making Venezuela one of the three most dangerous countries in the world, with almost 20,000 people killed each year. Locals in the 23 de Enero district say that, on an average weekend, there are between five and 10 homicides. The police are not in control here.</p> <p>The revolution began in 23 de Enero long before the <em>comandante</em> came to power. In his youth, Torres was a member of the urban guerrilla movement. \"Here's where we used to throw molotov cocktails,\" he says as we walk through his district.</p> <p>Today a red-starred flag on the lamppost in the main square of his neighbourhood proclaims this as the territory of the GHPP urban guerrilla group. One wall is daubed with a mural of the Virgin Mary holding an AK-47. Another has a portrait of Che Guevara and a declaration, \"We will never go back to the past. Onward with the revolution.\"</p> <p>Torres's son, Jon\u00e1s, is a passionate Ch\u00e1vez supporter. \"Things have improved. I have read about how it was before and I have heard from my mother about the social injustice and indiscriminate violence by the police. Ch\u00e1vez is the best chance for change,\" he says.</p> <p>Nevertheless, for the first time in any presidential election since Ch\u00e1vez came to power, the outcome is in doubt. After a year of battling cancer, Ch\u00e1vez has been uncharacteristically subdued for much of the campaign, while Henrique Capriles has jetted back and forth across the country, drawing vast crowds wherever he goes.</p> <p>Capriles is the first opposition candidate to be selected in a primary vote and has benefited from youthful good looks and a reputation as a political winner. Although many of his supporters hail from the neoliberal right, he has successfully eaten into Ch\u00e1vez's traditional vote by promising to continue many of his social policies and implement them more effectively.</p> <p>The narrowing gap in the polls has prompted rumours of unrest in Ch\u00e1vez strongholds if the outcome is disputed. The president's aides insist they are ready to accept the choice of the electorate, but this has not ended suspicion on the streets. \"The armed guerrillas have always existed. If it is a tight result and they feel cheated, they'll go out and fight for the <em>comandante</em>,\" says Torres.</p> <p>Torres predicts Ch\u00e1vez will win by a close margin, but is reluctant to say outright who he will vote for. \"If the opposition get in, I don't know what will happen. But I'm not afraid of them. I'm not afraid of anyone.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Sunday 30 September. It originally described Caprilles as rightwing. This has been changed to centre-right since Ch\u00e1vez's challenger has greens and labour activists among his supporters.</p>",

  "<p>The killing of the US ambassador to Libya is rapidly becoming election fodder, as Republicans seize on confusion over the circumstances of Chris Stevens' death in Benghazi three weeks ago and accuse the Obama administration of covering up an al-Qaeda connection.</p> <p>US officials reiterated on on Friday that they regard the killing of Stevens and three other Americans working for the state department at the US consulate in Benghazi as an assault by terrorists who planned the attack. But a dearth of real information about the exact circumstances of the assault has left open the question of whether such planning was merely the work of a few hours, to take advantage of a spontaneous anti-US protest over a short internet video that prompted demonstrations across the Middle East by offended Muslims, or weeks and months, to mark the 11th anniversary of al-Qaeda's 9/11 attacks on the US. </p> <p>Disagreement over that question is dividing along political lines. </p> <p>Earlier this week, Republican senators wrote to the US ambassador to the UN, Susan Rice, demanding that she explain her statement, five days after the killings, that they were part of a spontaneous anti-US protest. Four senators signed the letter, including John McCain, which said Rice made \"several troubling statements that are inconsistent with the facts and require explanation\". </p> <p>The former New York mayor Rudolf Giuliani, who sought the Republican nomination for the presidency in 2008, went further, accusing the White House of a cover-up.</p> <p>Speaking to Fox News, Giuliani said: \"This is a deliberate attempt to cover up the truth, from an administration that claimed it wanted to be the most transparent in history. And it's the worst kind of cover-up: the kind of cover-up that involves our national security. This is a cover-up that involves the slaughter of four Americans.\" </p> <p>Rice's explanation of a spontaneous assault by a well-armed Libyan militia was maintained by the administration until 10 days ago when Matthew Olsen, director of the National Counterterrorism Centre, called the killings a terrorist attack.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, and the defence secretary, Leon Panetta, this week shifted away from the initial line. Clinton on Wednesday hinted that the al-Qaeda offshoot in North Africa may be tied up with the Benghazi assault.</p> <p>\"Now with a larger safe haven and increased freedom to manoeuvre, terrorists are seeking to extend their reach and their networks in multiple directions,\" Clinton told a meeting of international leaders at the UN which discussed the crisis in North Africa, including the seizure of northern Mali by armed Islamist forces. \"And they are working with other violent extremists to undermine the democratic transitions under way in North Africa, as we tragically saw in Benghazi.\"</p> <p>Administration officials were careful to say afterwards that Clinton was not claiming firm evidence of a link. Olsen was similarly cautious in speaking to senators this week.</p> <p>\"The picture that is emerging is one where a number of different individuals were involved, so it's not necessarily an either/or proposition,\" he said. </p> <p>Officials say that while there is some evidence that individual members of the local militia responsible for the attack, Ansar al-Shariah, may have been in touch with extremist elements in other countries, no hard information has so far emerged of a direct foreign or al-Qaeda link to the attack in Benghazi. </p> <p>The chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Martin Dempsey, on Thursday said there \"was a thread of intelligence reporting that groups in the environment in eastern Libya were seeking to coalesce but there wasn't anything specific\". He added that there was no intelligence indicating a looming attack. </p> <p>Officials say US intelligence picked up a call by a member of al-Qaeda in North Africa celebrating the attack, but that is not hard evidence of a link. </p> <p>Panetta said on Thursday that there was some preplanning involved in the assault.</p> <p>\"As we determined the details of what took place [in Benghazi], and how that attack took place it became clear that there were terrorists who had planned that attack,\" he said.</p> <p>But whether that was over the proceeding hours, when the militia realised it could take advantage of the existing protest outside the consulate, or over the previous days and weeks remains a question investigators are struggling to answer. At present, the Americans are unable even to establish how large the protest was and how long it went on.</p> <p>Administration officials continue to maintain that if there was preplanning, it was not long term. But some Republicans argue that there is already evidence, circumstantial and otherwise, of a plot. For a start, they say it is no coincidence that the assault on the Benghazi consulate was on 11 September. </p> <p>The discovery in the wrecked consulate, by CNN, of Stevens' diary has also fed claims that the White House is underplaying a broader terrorist connection. Stevens wrote that he feared he was an al-Qaeda hit list and was alarmed by his lack of security after earlier attacks on US and British targets in Benghazi and amid what he described as a growing al-Qaeda presence in Libya. </p> <p>The state department's furious reaction to CNN's reporting of Stevens' fears \u2013 calling the use of non-personal information from the diary without the family's approval \"disgusting\" \u2013 suggested alarm in the administration at the potential damage to its denials of a conspiracy and that it will be open to criticism that it did not provide sufficient protection to the Benghazi consulate.</p> <p>There are also questions about the circumstances of Stevens death and whether Libyan militias knew he was at the consulate. However, given the large footprint American diplomats make as they move around the Middle East, it would not have been difficult to discern that an important US official had arrived in Benghazi. </p> <p>Giuliani said the White House was reluctant to admit al-Qaeda involvement because it wants to dismiss that threat following last year's killing of Osama Bin Laden.</p> <p>\"I think it's because they have this narrative that they defeated al-Qaeda,\" he said. \"They never say the words 'Islamic fundamentalist terrorism'. They want to wish it away. The president was moving on to Asia \u2013 he was going to declare this a great victory for himself and unfortunately, this terrible act of terror intervened in their very convenient narrative.\"</p> <p>Libya's president, Mohamed Magariaf, has also made the link by blaming \"al-Qaeda elements\" hiding in his country for the death of Stevens and three other Americans working for the state department.</p> <p>\"It was a preplanned act of terrorism directed against American citizens,\" Magariaf said this week.</p> <p>But claims of an al-Qaeda connection has been met with scepticism by others in Libya who say it is feasible for well armed militiamen to have taken advantage of the protests outside the US consulate to launch a substantial attack. </p> <p>The likelihood of a definitive explanation any time soon looks dim. </p> <p>The Obama administration has said an FBI investigation will establish the facts. But the New York Times on Friday reported that the FBI team remains in the Libyan capital, Tripoli, over 400 miles away, because of fears for its safety. </p> <p>Meanwhile the crime scene of the killings in Benghazi has been picked over by Libyans, who are assumed to have compromised what ever evidence there was that would have been of use to investigators. </p> <p>One US law enforcement official in Tripoli told the New York Times that they may never make it to Benghazi.</p>",

  "<p>The bitter and negative 2012 US presidential election has left few political reputations intact. Republican challenger Mitt Romney has run a staggering, gaffe-prone campaign, while President Barack Obama is battling a listless economy and a disenchanted Democratic base.</p> <p>But, through all the attacks ads, missteps and heated controversies, both Bill and Hillary Clinton have emerged with their reputations and status not only intact but greatly enhanced. In a remarkable development, and 12 years since they vacated the White House, the Clintons have rarely seemed more influential or more relevant.</p> <p>Rather than slipping away into obscurity, Bill Clinton is hitting the campaign trail hard for Obama after his<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzDhk3BHi6Q\" title=\"\"> stirring performance at the Democratic convention</a> in Charlotte, North Carolina, overshadowed the president. Meanwhile, secretary of state Hillary Clinton is trotting the globe as America's top diplomat amid feverish speculation that, whichever of Obama or Romney wins on Tuesday 6 November, she will again run for the White House in 2016. That could make her the first female US president and conceivably extend Clintonian domination of US politics to 2024.</p> <p>\"How many couples do we know of in American politics, or any politics, that are so manifestly talented, accomplished, persistent, persuasive and so evenly matched?\" asked William Galston, a former top adviser to Bill Clinton and now a fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. \"One has already been president and the other nearly was and may still be.\"</p> <p>Bill Clinton is an unexpectedly visible figure on the 2012 campaign trail, hitting key swing states such as New Hampshire. He holds pro-Obama rallies and puts his name to fundraising emails. His speech in Charlotte won plaudits from both sides of the political aisle. Indeed, when Romney later came to speak at an event in New York hosted by Clinton's charity, the Republican candidate joked about the former president's seemingly magic touch. \"If there's one thing we've learned in this election season, by the way, it is that a few words from Bill Clinton can do a man a lot of good,\" he said.</p> <p>Experts believe much of the goodwill now exhibited towards Clinton reflects a perception that his 1990s presidency was largely free from the wars and economic crises that have gripped America over the past decade. \"We think of it as a time of peace and prosperity. We don't think Obama measures up. We know Romney does not measure up. So we want what we don't now have,\" said Larry Haas, a political expert and former aide in the Clinton White House.</p> <p>There is also the fact that the former president remains one of the most gifted speakers in the world whose appetite for attention and publicity is entirely undiminished since his heyday and is in stark contrast to other former presidents, such as George W Bush.</p> <p>\"He is the most persuasive man on the planet,\" said Galston. Or, to put it another way, \"he just cannot help himself. He has never been shy of upstaging the person he is supposed to be supporting,\" commented Professor Andrew Smith, a political scientist at the University of New Hampshire.</p> <p>Of course, when it comes to Bill Clinton the bad also comes along with the good. Amid all the plaudits have emerged reports that Monica Lewinsky, the White House intern whose tryst with Clinton became a decade-defining sex scandal, is planning to write a tell-all book. If it does emerge, it will no doubt see a rehash of all the seedy low points of Clinton's presidency. But few expect it to have any real impact. The Lewinsky affair is old news and \u2013 as he does not have an elected office \u2013 Clinton is immune to the effect of such scandals.</p> <p>So far the political career of his wife has been scandal-free. As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton has carved out a reputation as a tough operator whose term of office has been a resounding success. Indeed, after being narrowly beaten by Obama for the 2008 nomination, many now see her as a natural runner for 2016. Clinton herself, who is standing down from her diplomatic job in 2013, has said she has no such plans. But the firm denials have done nothing to dampen down the speculation and most experts see a huge opportunity for her. \"Clinton has done best by staying out of the way of the 2012 race. If you are not getting down in the mud with everyone else, then you stay clean,\" said Smith.</p> <p>Though Clinton would be 68 by 2016 few people see her age as a real block to her ambitions. Instead, they see a powerful candidate, hugely popular with the crucial demographic of women voters, who might be able to take advantage of a Democratic base suffering from \"buyer's remorse\" when it comes to the high initial hopes for the Obama presidency.</p> <p>Her campaign organisation from 2008 would also be relatively easy to revitalise, giving her a huge advantage in fund-raising and on-the-ground activists.</p> <p>\"The folks I know who worked for her in New Hampshire have kept the organisation together. She could go pretty quickly and hit the ground running,\" said Smith.</p> <p>Of course, the key question is: does Clinton want to run again? No one knows the answer, including probably Clinton herself.</p> <p>\"I bet she hasn't figured it out yet,\" said Haas. But what seems certain is that the moment for a decision will come some time in 2014. If she says yes, then not only will America be once again facing up to the idea of a historic Hillary Clinton presidency but Bill will be right there alongside her. For if the country has learned one thing about the Clintons, it is that \u2013 despite their many differences and difficulties \u2013 they seem to come as a pair. \"The last chapter of this saga has not been written yet,\" said Galston.</p>",
  "<p>For months the chatter in Labour circles has been \"it's too good to be true\". The polls may say the party is 10 points ahead, but Labour strategists convince themselves the lead is \"soft\" and the path to electability remains daunting.</p> <p>But is Labour's lead really that soft? To get to the bottom of this question, the Fabian Society looked at how many people say they are certain to vote Labour. The answer suggests a Labour majority is now the most likely outcome at the 2015 election.</p> <p>Today, according to YouGov polling, about 8.5 million people say the chances they will consider Labour at the next election are 10-out-of-10, while to win a majority Labour will need something like 11m votes. So Ed Miliband needs to find in the region of 2.5m votes from people who say their minds are not totally made up.</p> <p>David Cameron's challenge is much greater: he has to find an extra 4.5m votes. This is because today there are one million fewer people who are \"10-out-of-10\" Conservative voters, while the quirks of our electoral system mean Cameron needs at least one million votes more than Miliband to win a majority.</p> <p>To get a feel for where these missing votes might come from, we looked at people who say their chance of considering each party is between five and nine out of 10. Again, Labour has far more of these \"possible\" voters than the Conservatives \u2013 14m compared with 10m. So Miliband not only needs to win fewer votes from among his waverers, he is also fishing in a bigger pool. Assuming for a moment that all the \"10-out-of-10\" supporters vote, in 2015 Miliband will need less than 20% of the Labour \"possibles\", while Cameron will need almost half the Tory equivalent.</p> <p>Of course, these numbers are based on mid-term polls and an awful lot could happen in the next two years. The Lib Dems might change leader, with a \"Vince bounce\" seeing the party claw back support from Labour. The Conservatives could stage a successful assault on Labour with an election campaign focused on the deficit, immigration, Europe, welfare and Miliband's readiness for power.</p> <p>The point is that Labour has a strong cushion, which gives the party space to slip some way before the chance of a majority recedes. Even a really big jump in both Conservative and Lib Dem support would still leave Labour the largest party, just short of an outright majority.</p> <p>Labour is also relatively immune to losing support directly to the Conservatives. Today, it is riding high in the polls despite having won over few of David Cameron's 2010 voters, while only six million of Labour's 22 million potential supporters are considering voting Tory. Most of Cameron's target voters currently support Ukip, the Lib Dems or are sitting on their hands. This means Labour can withstand a Tory resurgence as long as it is able to hang on to plenty of former Lib Dems and persuade some sympathisers who did not vote in 2010 to cast their ballot next time.</p> <p>Chasing lots of Conservative voters by tacking to the right is unwise as well as unnecessary. It risks alienating recent Labour converts such as left-leaning Lib Dems and others disaffected during the New Labour years. Indeed, Fabian analysis shows that Labour supporters today are no less leftwing than they were in 2010, even though there are so many more of them. The tectonic plates of British politics have shifted and the make-or-break voters who will decide the next election are now further to the left than in the New Labour era.</p> <p>So what does this mean for Ed Miliband's pitch to the public? Despite the strong numbers, Labour cannot afford to be complacent. The party will struggle if it sits back and presents itself as an empty vessel for people's discontentment with a shambolic government. Following this course might well be enough for Labour to become the largest party in parliament, but not to win a convincing majority. Miliband must remember that unless Labour defines itself, it will offer a blank canvass for the Conservatives to define the party in the worst possible light.</p> <p>His priority must be to inspire people who are looking for reasons to vote Labour with a positive alternative and purposeful leadership. In the year ahead, Labour must set out a handful of big, signature proposals that exemplify how and why it would govern, what marks it out from the coalition and how people's lives would change.</p> <p>Miliband's model must be 1945 or 1979, when the winning party entered the election with a strong and clear alternative which captured the public zeitgeist and heralded a rupture from the past. Making big promises may feel risky, but it also shows substance and decisiveness. These are the qualities which need to register with the millions of people looking for reasons to back Labour.</p>"
