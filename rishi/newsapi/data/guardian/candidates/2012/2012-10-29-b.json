  "<p>Emergency legislation is being rushed through the Commons this week to correct a Home Office blunder over next month's police and crime commissioner elections that could cost up to \u00a3350,000.</p> <p>The unexpected cost covers the printing of a second set of ballot papers in Wales, where an official oversight led to legislation being passed that authorised only the printing of an English version of the ballot paper.</p> <p>Returning officers in Wales have a duty to see the Welsh language is given equal status to English. They have contingency plans to print bilingual ballot papers in Welsh and English for the poll to elect police commissioners on 15 November. The Home Office, which is to foot the bill, has confirmed that the cost will be up to \u00a3350,000.</p> <p>The Electoral Commission said the emergency legislation on the Welsh ballot papers needed to be in place by this Wednesday when the initial issue of postal votes for the elections is due to start at 5pm. \"If this order is not made, the ballot papers used in Wales will only be available to voters in English,\" the commission warned MPs.</p> <p>Labour's policing spokesman, David Hanson, said: \"This is another example of the slipshod way in which the government has organised these elections. The Home Office said they would sort this out with legislation early in the year but didn't publish it until July. It still hasn't been passed with commissioners taking up their posts in just a few weeks' time.\"</p> <p>The Home Office said it was confident the legislation will be in place.</p> <p>It also emerged that crime prevention and community safety funding for projects such as CCTV schemes, gang intervention programmes and police officers in schools are facing a 60% cut. Home Office figures show community safety funding is due to fall from \u00a374m in 2010-11 to \u00a359m in 2011-12, and to an unconfirmed allocation of only \u00a330m in this financial year.</p>",
  "<p>It's a revolting spectacle: the two presidential candidates engaged in a frantic and demeaning scramble for money. By 6&#xa0;November, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney will each have raised more than $1bn. Other groups have already spent a further billion. Every&#xa0;election costs more than the one before; every election, as a result, drags the United States deeper into cronyism and corruption. Whichever candidate takes the most votes, it's the money that&#xa0;wins.</p> <p>Is it conceivable, for instance, that Romney, <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/pres12/contrib.php?id=N00000286\" title=\"\">whose top five donors are all Wall Street banks</a>, would put the financial sector back in its cage? Or&#xa0;that Obama, who has received $700,000 from both Microsoft and Google, would challenge their monopolistic powers? Or, in the Senate,&#xa0;that the leading climate change denier <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2012/aug/02/climate-change-political-funding-us\" title=\"\">James Inhofe, whose biggest donors are fossil fuel companies</a>, could change his views, even when confronted by an overwhelming weight of evidence? The US feeding frenzy shows how the safeguards and structures of a nominal democracy can remain in place while the system they define mutates into plutocracy.</p> <p>Despite perpetual attempts to reform it, US campaign finance is now more corrupt and corrupting than it has been for decades. It is hard to see how it can be redeemed. If the corporate cronies and billionaires' bootlickers who currently hold office were to vote to change the system, they'd commit political suicide. What else, apart from the money they spend, would recommend them to the American people?</p> <p>But we should see this system as a ghastly warning of what happens if a nation fails to purge the big money from politics. The British system, by comparison to the US one, looks almost cute. Total&#xa0;campaign spending in the last general election \u2013 by the parties, the candidates and independent groups \u2013 was \u00a358m: about one sixtieth of the cost of the current presidential race. There's a cap on overall spending and tough restrictions on political advertising.</p> <p>But it's still rotten. There is no limit on individual donations. In a system with low total budgets, this grants tremendous leverage to the richest donors. The political parties know that if they do anything that offends the interests of corporate power they jeopardise their prospects.</p> <p>The solutions proposed by parliament would make our system a little less rotten. At the end of last year, the committee on standards in public life proposed that donations <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CB8QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.public-standards.gov.uk%2FLibrary%2F13th_Report___Political_party_finance_FINAL_PDF_VERSION_18_11_11.pdf&amp;ei=Lr2OUIOWPIrPhAeuyIH4DQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNFO4v6TrR-5abKp4X3dzhycQfiltA\" title=\"\">should be capped at an annual \u00a310,000</a>, the limits on campaign spending should be reduced, and public funding for political parties should be raised. Parties, it says, should receive a state subsidy based on the size of their vote at the last election.</p> <p>The political process would still be dominated by people with plenty of disposable income. In the course of a five-year election cycle, a husband and wife would be allowed to donate, from the same bank account, \u00a3100,000.&#xa0;State&#xa0;funding pegged to votes at the last election favours the incumbent parties. It means that even when public support for a party has collapsed (think of the Liberal Democrats), it still receives a popularity bonus.</p> <p>Even so, and despite their manifesto pledges, the three major parties have refused to accept the committee's findings. The excuse all of them use is that the state cannot afford more funding for political parties. This is a ridiculous objection. The money required is scarcely a rounding error in national accounts. It probably represents less than we pay every day for the crony capitalism the present system encourages: the unnecessary spending on private finance initiative projects, on roads to nowhere, on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/29/tories-lib-dems-trident\" title=\"\">Trident</a> programme and all the rest, whose primary purpose is to keep the 1% sweet. The overall cost of our suborned political process is incalculable: a corrupt and inefficient economy, and a political system engineered to meet not the needs of the electorate, but the demands of big business and billionaires.</p> <p>I would go much further than the parliamentary committee. This, I think, is what a democratic funding system would look like: each party would be able to charge the same, modest fee for&#xa0;membership (perhaps \u00a350). It&#xa0;would&#xa0;then receive matching funding from the state, as a multiple of&#xa0;its membership receipts. There would&#xa0;be&#xa0;no other sources of income. (This formula would make brokerage by&#xa0;trade unions redundant.)</p> <p>This system, I believe, would not only&#xa0;clean up politics, it would also force parties to re-engage with the public. It&#xa0;would oblige them to be more entrepreneurial in raising their membership, and therefore their democratic legitimacy. It creates an incentive for voters to join a party and to begin, once more, to participate in politics.</p> <p>The cost to the public would be perhaps \u00a350m a year, or a little more than \u00a31 per elector: three times the price&#xa0;of a telephone vote on The X Factor. This, on the scale of state expenditure, is microscopic.</p> <p>Politicians and the tabloid press would complain bitterly about this system, claiming, as they already do, that taxpayers cannot afford to fund politics. But when you look at how the appeasement of the banking sector has ruined the economy, at how corporate muscle prevents action from being taken on climate change, at the economic and political distortions caused by the system of crony capitalism, and at the hideous example on the other side of the Atlantic, you discover that we can't afford not to.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeorgeMonbiot\" title=\"\"><em>@georgemonbiot</em></a><em> </em></p> <p><em>A fully referenced version of this article can be found at </em><a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Monbiot.com</em></a></p>",
  "<p>In any election, politicians' pretty much always-false modesty prompts them to exclaim that they themselves are playing but a part in the march of history. Obama cut an <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBorRZnqtMo\">ad</a> that admitted:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Sometimes, politics can seem very small \u2013 but the choice you face? It couldn't be bigger.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Last week, Paul Ryan made a <a href=\"http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/10/24/14676153-ryan-puts-softer-edge-on-gop-plans-in-major-economic-speech?lite\">feint</a> at bipartisanship with a similar argument:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Mitt and I have a message that's bigger than party.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Hurricane Sandy reminds us of what truly monumental events, and the decisions we make in the face of them, look like.</p> <p>Sandy is not just bigger than any campaign and powerful enough to banish all the feeble fantasies humans s have about our relationship to the physical world. Though Sandy may finally bring a discussion about the environment to the forefront of politicians' minds, one of humanity's only creations that's almost impervious to the kind of force battering the US east coast is denial. (Then again, note the Earth's stubborn, intractable reactions to our abuse.)</p> <p>We can talk about \"man-made\" climate change, but there's a difference between having control over something and taking responsibility for it. Our part in global warming is more like that of someone dropping a lit cigarette in the forest, rather than someone starting a fire for heat.</p> <p>As for arguments about who did or didn't \"build that\" \u2013 Sandy don't care. Buildings are flimsy and our plans even more insubstantial; our opinions revealed to be nothing more than spit and a wish for wind in the right direction.</p> <p>You can sense among political professionals a vague sense of panic about Sandy, which is ancillary to the more specific and very real worries that they harbor about loved ones and their own, mostly likely east coast, lives.</p> <p>We don't yet know Sandy's precise impact on the election \u2013 on a practical level, the storm will disrupt early in-person voting, rallies in east-coast states will go unattended, ads may be inescapable when people are driven indoors, or they may be unwatched in places that lose power. Beyond that immediate effect, will Sandy wash away political trivia and remind voters of the true stakes of picking a president? Will these disruptions freeze the race where it is, or will Sandy remind people of the stakes involved in picking a leader, swaying them toward the one who seems the safer choice?</p> <p>The magnitude of the storm should underscore, not contrast, the relationship between the people's will and predictions that existed before. It's not as though pundits and pols had any better idea of what would happen prior to Sandy's landfall. This election has been unprecedented on so many levels, you couldn't even tweet them all: the amount of money being spent, the ideological divide between the parties, the infuriating vagueness of one candidate's ideas.</p> <p>Sandy is just another element beyond control: you can't even poll a storm \u2013 much like the ideas of low-information, undecided voters, it's nothing but a resounding, echoing howl.</p> <p>The Frankenstorm \u2013 an appellation that would make&#xa0;Mary Shelley&#xa0;wince at the lack of a possessive, though she might approve of the sentiment \u2013 is an immediate, measurable reminder that politics is, in the end, not about messaging and postures and positioning, but the structure of people's lives: who they can turn to when they have no resources left themselves, who they can look to when all the options are bad, and what they can do with what they have left when it seems like nothing at all.</p> <p>We're not choosing the nation's CEO, a boss-in-chief. Mitt Romney's approach to poor performance is eliminating jobs, it's only Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) employees he could fire \u2013 and he's said he <a href=\"http://wonkette.com/488017/mitt-romney-iz-in-ur-hurricane-privatizin-ur-fema\">wants</a> to \u2013 not the natural disaster itself. You can't put the bravery of first responders on a balance sheet, or quantify human loss.</p> <p>Whoever becomes president, the job is really that of a community organizer \u2013 whether that's the role they're prepared for or not.</p>",
  "<p>The onslaught of hurricane Sandy has forced Barack Obama and Mitt Romney to suspend campaigning for at least 48 hours \u2013 time both teams desperately needed in the crucial final stretch to election day next week.</p> <p>The two presidential candidates cancelled all scheduled events until at least midnight on Tuesday but there could be further disruption for much of the rest of the week, with flooding and power blackouts also taking their toll on the campaign teams' movements.</p> <p>Early voting has already been suspended in some states \u2013 where the Obama campaign had hoped to make crucial gains before the election on 6 November.</p> <p>Each team headquarters sent out instructions to switch from campaigning if need be to help the rescue services and told volunteers in affected areas to stay at home. The advice even included small practical points, such as the Romney team advising supporters to remove any election placards that could become flying projectiles in the storm.</p> <p>The impact on the respective campaigns is unpredictable.</p> <p>David Axelrod, Obama's campaign manager, told reporters: \"In terms of the logistics, we are obviously going to lose a bunch of campaign time; this is as it has to be and we will try to make it up on the back end.</p> <p>Obama abandoned planned rallies in Florida on Monday morning and in Ohio in the afternoon in order to return to Washington after being told the storm was shaping up to be worse than expected and that if he delayed, they might have trouble getting back to the capital.</p> <p>A plane full of journalists accompanying him on the campaign trail had to be left behind in Florida.</p> <p>Asked later about the impact of the storm on the election campaign, the president presented himself as being above such things as consideration of how it would affect voting. \"I am not worried at this point about the impact on the election. I'm worried about the impact on families, and I'm worried about the impact on our first responders. I'm worried about the impact on our economy and on transportation,\" Obama said.</p> <p>\"The election will take care of itself next week. Right now, our number one priority is to make sure that we are saving lives, that our search-and-rescue teams are going to be in place, that people are going to get the food, the water, the shelter that they need in case of emergency, and that we respond as quickly as possible to get the economy back on track.\"</p> <p>Obama had to return to the White House to be seen to be on the spot, monitoring the storm and in regular contact with the emergency services. To have continued campaigning while millions of people faced the prospect of costly damage might have alienated voters.</p> <p>Romney's campaign team reached the same conclusion. Having rescheduled campaigning to take him away from states on the storm path, such as Virginia, to Ohio, he too changed his mind and followed Obama in cancelling all events.</p> <p>Romney realised it might appear callous to be seen standing in front of rallies in sunshine, while people on the east coast faced disruption and damage. His vice-presidential running mate, Paul Ryan, also scrapped campaign events.</p> <p>Gail Gitcho, a Romney communications director, said: \"Out of sensitivity for the millions of Americans in the path of hurricane Sandy, we are cancelling tonight's events with Governor Romney in Wisconsin and Congressman Ryan in Melbourne and Lakeland, Florida. We are also cancelling all events currently scheduled for both Governor Romney and Congressman Ryan on Tuesday.</p> <p>\"Governor Romney believes this is a time for the nation and its leaders to come together to focus on those Americans who are in harm's way.\"</p> <p>Obama described the storm as \"big and powerful\" but took solace in the fact that the emergency services have had a few days to prepare.</p> <p>Echoing the Romney campaign about America coming together in time of crisis, he said: \"It's going to be a difficult storm. The great thing about America is when we go through tough times like this we all pull together. We look out for our friends. We look out for our neighbours. And we set aside whatever issues we may have otherwise to make sure that we respond appropriately and with swiftness. And that's exactly what I anticipate is going to happen here.\"</p> <p>Obama said he had spoken to all the governors of the states in the path of the storm to make sure food and water and emergency generation would be available for the hardest-hit.</p> <p>\"The most important message that I have for the public right now is, please listen to what your state and local officials are saying. When they tell you to evacuate, you need to evacuate. Do not delay. Don't pause; don't question the instructions that are being given, because this is a serious storm and it could potentially have fatal consequences if people haven't acted quickly,\" he said.</p> <p>He told the public to expect blackouts and warned that it might take time to get the power back on and transport restored.</p> <p>Neither side has as yet attempted to make political capital out of the storm. Romney is potentially exposed after saying in a debate during the Republican primaries and caucuses that he favoured cutting the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) to help reduce the deficit.</p> <p>The Romney campaign stood by that assessment, saying it was not proposing to abolish Fema, only that decisions about emergency spending should rest primarily with states rather than with the federal government.</p> <p>Ryan Williams, a Romney spokesman, said in a statement: \"Governor Romney believes that states should be in charge of emergency management in responding to storms and other natural disasters in their jurisdictions.</p> <p>\"As the first responders, states are in the best position to aid affected individuals and communities, and to direct resources and assistance to where they are needed most. This includes help from the federal government and Fema.\"</p> <p>With polls showing the two campaigns tied neck and neck, both Obama and Romney were initially reluctant to quit the campaign trail.</p> <p>Obama, after rearranging his schedule, tried to squeeze in two events before the storm hit, flying to Florida on Sunday evening to be in position for a joint rally with former president Bill Clinton in Orlando on Monday morning. He stayed overnight in Florida, but his team advised him against going ahead with the rally, leaving Clinton to do it on his own.</p>",
  "<p>A small mushroom cloud of indignation greeted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/29/nick-clegg-attacks-philip-hammond-trident\" title=\"\">Philip Hammond's nuclear announcement</a> on his first trip to Faslane. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg accused the defence secretary of \"jumping the gun\" with a pre-emptive \u00a3350m announcement that his party will thunder ahead with a like-for-like replacement for Trident. As a coalition review of possible alternatives reports in January, why this poke in the eye? Lib Dems protested convincingly at this provocative political positioning to appease the Tory right.</p> <p>But for all the radioactive language, this hard blue dividing line doesn't displease their coalition partners. Why&#xa0;would it? Both sides yearn for separate identities \u2013 and with the final decision kicked beyond the election to 2016, both can safely posture with no threat to the coalition.</p> <p>Tim Farron, the Lib Dem president, says it is inconceivable his party would ever be \"handcuffed to Trident\". He tells me, \"We are making this an election issue for 2015\", boasting that \"we have already prevented a vast amount of money being wasted on it in this parliament.\" Nick Clegg said yesterday that he would prevent the spending of \"billions and billions and billions of pounds on a nuclear missile system designed with the sole strategic purpose of flattening Moscow at the press of a button\".</p> <p>All who opine from every party speak solemnly of the need to make the right decision on Britain's defence for the next 50 years. Believe not a word of it: they are all thinking of the election in two and a half years. The Lib Dems will be pleased to be the least pro-nuclear party, hoping to woo anti-war votes they won from Labour over Iraq, but lost over coalescing with Tories. The Tories are happy to defend repeating a defence system designed in the early 1960s, because that's where their supporters are.</p> <p>Alex Salmond will be smiling too. If Philip Hammond thought he was sending a missile into the SNP campaign for the 2014 referendum, he blew it. The Labour side of the \"Better together\" campaign says there are many fruitful defence issues that might swing the debate away from independence: could Scots still join the British army and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/22/scotland-independence-nuclear-weapons-nato\" title=\"\">should they join Nato</a>? But instead Hammond chose the one question Salmond feels is on his winning ground \u2013<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/21/alex-salmond-independent-scotland-trident\" title=\"\"> ridding Scotland of nuclear weapons</a>.</p> <p>So we know where everyone stands \u2013 except Labour. Deep policy thought is in progress. Ask, and it all depends who you talk to. Some in Labour are nuclear-heads because they occupy seats such as John Woodcock's Barrow, a one-industry town dependent on defence. Others are nuclear out of strong conviction a unilateralist Labour would be dead at the polls. Probably no one in Labour actually believes we need a Trident replacement for national defence \u2013 only for political defence of Labour. The higher theology of nuclear weapons was always about face, status and politics.</p> <p>In Tony Blair's autobiography, he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/sep/16/trident-expensive-useless-liam-fox\" title=\"\">admits his reasons for cleaving to Trident </a>were essentially political. But others, around Ed Miliband, see the end of all those political certainties. What use is a cold-war deterrent against present terrorism? Do we want to keep punching above our weight, why and at what cost?</p> <p>But these subtle existential national questions will be put through the mincer of election warfare. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/26/trident-nuclear-missiles-review-downgrading\" title=\"\">Sir Nick Harvey</a>, on being evicted from the defence department, says the review he was supervising will suggest third ways, stretching existing systems out for far longer, or as he put it, keeping a nuclear deterrent in a cupboard for a rainy day.</p> <p>He admits that the 2016 deadline is entirely artificial, a political convenience that has nothing to do with the state of rust on submarines. Harvey plainly hopes Labour will opt for a third-way approach too. But the Tories itch for the chance to mount a Kinnock-like attack on Red Ed, weak on defence. So which way will Labour jump on Trident?</p> <p>Talking to someone alarmingly close to Labour decision-making, of pro-nuclear persuasion, you can still hear the mad old rationale for Trident, the need for continuous at-sea capability, the pretence we will be vulnerable unless a replacement is agreed by 2016. Alternatives are rapidly dismissed: land-based nukes would require a massively defended piece of land and that would cost more. So would an air-based system, with complex refuelling. So, yes, it's the new subs or nothing.</p> <p>Or, they whisper, there might be a cheap option but if the UK designed one, that would cause terrifying proliferation among all the world's small wannabe nuclear countries. What? Did he really say that? Any discussion of nuclear weapons soon reaches a point where it becomes clear that those who get up too close have their brains irradiated with nuclear nonsense. We must not only have the deterrent, but it must be super-expensive to keep the market price too high for new contenders?</p> <p>Another cross-party review of Trident is headed by former defence secretaries Malcolm Rifkind, Labour's Des Brown and Menzies Campbell. There is a chance here that new thinking might break the deadlock in British nuclear politics. A costing they commissioned says the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/mar/21/trident-nuclear-missiles-savings\" title=\"\">full Trident price tag is \u00a383.5bn</a> \u2013 or \u00a31.86bn a year until 2062.</p> <p>Is Labour really going to sign up to that? Few who know his mind think Ed Miliband will, though he may have to reshuffle his cabinet to abandon Trident. Nothing about the nuclear debate has ever been real, except the money and the votes. If some cheaper unreality emerges \u2013 a bomb in a cupboard \u2013 Labour and Lib Dems should both seize it, turning on the Tories for the \u00a33bn they will have wasted already.</p> <p>How will defence play out at the election? Pollsters don't know, since the issue has been in the deep freeze for so long. All depends on how you ask the question, says Ipsos Mori's Ben Page: a while ago voters were evenly balanced for keeping Trident, but told the cost in hospitals and schools, people turned against it. Yet pride in historic power is strong too, and fears can be stirred. YouGov's Peter Kellner agrees that people are reluctant to let go of past glory. Much will depend on winning strong backers: to abandon Trident, Labour needs cover from ex-generals calling for boots not nukes, plus experts from thinktanks like Chatham House and Rusi denouncing archaic cold war weaponry.</p> <p>But Kellner would warn the Tories too that they will need influential voices \u2013 not just the admirals \u2013 to convince voters new nuclear submarines are worth so much money at a time like this. Philip Hammond just fired the starting gun. We wait to see which way Labour jumps.</p>",
  "<p>More than 50 million people in the most densely populated corridor of the US waited with mounting dread for the full brute force of Hurricane Sandy on Monday, as the first gusts of wind and rain sent New York City and Washington into lockdown and forced tens of thousands to leave their homes.</p> <p>Hours before making landfall, Sandy had already demonstrated the destructive potential of what weather historians are billing as a \"once in a lifetime storm\". By midday it had sunk a tall ship off North Carolina, swamped a historic stretch of boardwalk in Atlantic City, knocked out power to 100,000 homes across the eastern seaboard and was lapping at the southern tip of Manhattan.</p> <p>And that was just the beginning. As landfall approached, the national hurricane centre reported that Sandy was gaining in strength with sustained winds of 90mph and gusts of up to 115mph. The centre of the storm was moving at about 25mph, significantly faster than during the early hours.</p> <p>Mayland's governor, Martin O'Malley, said that the country faced difficult days ahead with possible fatalities.</p> <p>The storm was expected to make landfall at about 8pm on Monday, where it would gain even greater force by combining with a winter storm or north-easter. Forecasters said the combined \"Frankenstorm\", as it has been nicknamed, could bring a foot of rain in some places, as well as potentially lethal storm surges, especially in lower Manhattan. High winds could produce power outages that would last for days, while residents of West Virginia, North Carolina and Kentucky were told to expect up to 2ft of snow.</p> <p>The storm has killed at least 65 people on its path through the Caribbean, including 51 in Haiti. As Sandy began to lurch westwards towards the east coast, Barack Obama and the authorities in nine states appealed to people to stay calm and out of harm's way. \"This is a serious and big storm and my first message is: 'You need to take this very seriously',\" Obama told a briefing at the White House on Monday.</p> <p>He reinforced instructions to residents from local authorities. \"Please listen to what your state and local officials are saying. When they tell you to evacuate, you need to evacuate,\" the president said.</p> <p>\"Do not delay, don't pause, don't question the instructions that are being given, because this is a serious storm and could potentially have fatal consequences if people haven't acted.\"</p> <p>The storm forced Obama and his challenger, Mitt Romney, to suspend their campaigns, at least through Tuesday. About 60 million other people, from North Carolina to New England, also experienced a suspension of their daily routine. Nine states declared a state of emergency, shutting down transport systems and schools and ordering residents of low-lying areas to head for higher ground. More than 9,000 flights were cancelled across the region, and the main rail service was suspended.</p> <p>In lower Manhattan, which was expected to get the worst of the storm, New York City's mayor, Michael Bloomberg, warned on Monday that the authorities were braced for an 11ft surge of seawater that could leave low-lying areas of the city under water. The city advised some 370,000 people in low-lying areas to evacuate at the weekend.</p> <p>By late morning, the authorities were moving to shut down the tunnels that connect Manhattan to Brooklyn and New Jersey. Subways, buses, trains and schools were shut, as well as the New York stock exchange, and Bloomberg warned normal services should not be expected before Wednesday.</p> <p>In the meantime, Sandy continued to churn up the coast. In North Carolina, crew were forced to abandon the tall ship HMS Bounty after it began to take on water. Coast Guard plucked 14 crew from lifeboats. Two remained missing.</p> <p>The storm also got in licks at coastal resort towns of Virginia Beach, Ocean City, and Bethany Beach. O'Malley said a fishing pier in the resort town of Ocean City was :\"half-gone\". Atlantic City had reports of water three blocks inland. Reports of power outages spanned from Virginia to Connecticut and Rhode Island.</p> <p>Rolling waves were already washing straight over the promenade wall in Battery Park, Manhattan, on Monday morning. The area \u2013 a popular tourist spot with its views of the Statue of Liberty \u2013 was part of Bloomberg's mandatory evacuation zone. Away from the water police cars were driving slowly along streets broadcasting warnings that people should leave. \"You must evacuate this area by 7pm today. Any person who knowingly violates this order may be charged with a class B misdemeanour,\" the warning said.</p> <p>The walkway \u2013 normally packed with people jogging and cycling \u2013 was almost entirely deserted, but Mark Gluck, a professor at Rutgers University, said Sandy was not about keep him from his daily cycle route. \"A bit of drizzle, a bit of wind, it's a perfectly fine day to go cycling,\" Gluck said.</p> <p>He said he planned to cycle to the Upper West Side later in the day for lunch. He had already stocked up his apartment for the storm. \"I'm well prepared, I've got food and water, I think it'll be fine.\"</p> <p>For the most, though, it appeared as if residents were heeding the official warnings to hunker down at home \u2013 or get out of town.</p> <p>But that created its own sense of dread. In Washington DC and other cities, many supermarkets ran out of staples such as bottled water and batteries well before the storm bore down.</p> <p>New York City's mandatory evacuation saw throngs of people crowding into evacuation centres across the five boroughs. Around 80 had stayed overnight at the John Jay high school in Park Slope, Brooklyn, with many more expected on Monday.</p> <p>They included three dogs, a cat, a turtle, a snake and a mouse. After last year's Hurricane Irene, the staff and volunteers were more than ready for them. A handwritten sign inside the door divided newcomers into two categories: people to the right, animals to the left.</p> <p>\"This time last year we had 1,000 people in here,\" said one of three officials as he stood outside on a break. \"We had two rooms full of dogs and cats too. This year we even got a turtle. And that snake's got his eye on the mouse. It it's not gonna happen.\"</p> <p>Inside, people from Coney Island, Red Hook and other low-lying areas of Brooklyn gathered to wait out the storm. They were served a cooked breakfast and there was BBQ chicken for lunch.</p> <p>The officers said they were surprised there were not more of them but wondered whether last year \u2013 when Irene passed New York without major incident \u2013 might have given people false reassurance.</p> <p>\"They ran out last year thinking it was the end, and it wasn't. But this one's different.\"</p> <p>\"It's horrible,\" said Davon Little, who manages a supermarket in the Brookland neighbourhood in north-east Washington after he ran out of water for a second time. \"The line's been going all the way down the aisles.

  "<p>* You can always tell when a close election race is nearing its end thanks to flurry of speculation about extraordinarily improbable outcomes. Could the electoral college be tied, 269-269? (Almost certainly not.) Could the polls be so shockingly biased that they're hiding evidence of a coming Romney landslide? (Almost certainly not, though let's pause to toast the impressive efforts of Dean Chambers, founder of the site Unskewed Polls, who argued recently that <a href=\"http://www.examiner.com/article/the-far-left-turns-to-nate-silver-for-wisdom-on-the-polls\" title=\"\">Nate Silver's New York Times analyses may be flawed</a> because \"Nate Silver is a man of very small stature, a thin and effeminate man with a soft-sounding voice\". Could both the electoral college and the Senate be tied? Again, realistically speaking, no, but <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/romney-biden-administration-could-happen-223736689--abc-news-politics.html\" title=\"\">the outcome would be splendidly weird</a> if so. It would fall to the House of Representatives to choose a president (they'd choose Romney) and to the Senate to choose a vice-president; they'd be tied between Paul Ryan and Joe Biden\u2026 and then the Senate's casting vote would fall to the serving vice-president, meaning that Biden could elect himself vice-president, serving in a Romney/Biden administration. Freaky? Yes, but these are strange times. Last week <a href=\"http://www.goupstate.com/article/20121029/WIRE/121029680\" title=\"\">a shark fell out of the sky onto a Californian golf course</a>. A historically vicious hurricane is attacking the eastern seaboard. Donald Trump is being taken semi-seriously. Anything could happen. Though in the case of the electoral college tie, it almost certainly won't.</p> <p>* Back in 2008, the suspicion that Barack Obama might be Muslim \u2013 or, <a href=\"http://isbarackobamamuslin.com/\" title=\"\">as it was expressed all too frequently, \"muslin\"</a> \u2013 was the biggest urban myth of the election campaign. So it was with understandable astonishment that <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/poll-more-americans-believe-obama-is-jewish-than-muslim.premium-1.472953\" title=\"\">several outlets reported</a> a major shift in the attitudes of America's all-important demographic of People Who Believe Wrong Things this weekend. Now, an Associated Press poll had determined, fully 18% of Americans believed Obama was Jewish. (A mere 10%, by contrast, were still convinced he was a follower of lslam or, alternatively, was made out of a lightweight, plain-weave cotton cloth.) In a country as vast and atomised as the United States \u2013 and with such wildly varying levels of access to education and information \u2013 similarly eccentric polling results aren't unusual: one survey earlier this year purported to show that 1% of Americans think <a href=\"http://www.politicususa.com/mitt-romney-muslim.html\" title=\"\">Mitt Romney is Muslim</a>. (His real religion, of course, is capitalism.) Seven per cent apparently believe that <a href=\"http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2012/10/7-americans-think-lee-harvey-oswald-shot-lincoln/57519/\" title=\"\">Lee Harvey Oswald shot Abraham Lincoln</a> But 18%? Really? Well, no As <a href=\"http://www.timesofisrael.com/no-one-in-five-americans-do-not-think-obama-is-jewish-in-fact-zero-percent-do/\" title=\"\">the Times of Israel figured out</a> the stunning finding was the result of a data-entry slip. The true proportion of Americans who believe Obama is Jewish is a more realistic zero per cent. The fat-fingered typist is hereby deemed forgiven \u2013 on this occasion. Next week, if a bungling data-entry clerk hands Ohio, say, in a landslide to the Republicans, they'd better not expect such indulgence.</p> <p>* \"You only live once, and I was born with a forehead, so why not?\" Words to live by \u2013 and a motto that gave Eric Hartsburg, of Indiana, all the justification he needed to make <a href=\"http://www.abc57.com/news/local/la-porte/Michigan-City-man-selling-forehead-space-for-tattoo-167395175.html\" title=\"\">a political decision that will certainly change his life</a>. In return for $15,000 from an anonymous Republican on eBay, Hartsburg, ABC News reports, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/10/man-gets-romney-r-tattooed-on-his-face-for-15000/\" title=\"\">has had the blue-and-red double-R logo of the Romney-Ryan campaign tattooed on his temple</a>. We know nothing about the mystery Republican, except that he or she has more money than sense. (Mitt? Is that you?) But for his part, now that the deed is done, Hartsburg seems keen to imbue it with some higher meaning. \"In the beginning it was done for gags and publicity,\" he said. \"But now I see it as a way to encourage young people to vote.\" To be fair, this is a strong argument, apart from the fact that it makes no sense. He goes on: \"I want young people to know that it's OK to be young and it's OK to be a Republican. You don't have to be rich or elderly to be labelled as a Republican, and I want everyone to know that.\" A cynic might suggest Hartsburg was just trying to save face \u2013 except that his face, sadly, is exactly what's now beyond saving.</p> <p>*Mitt Romney, campaigning in Ohio: \"This is a big election, about things.\" Never let it be said his platform lacks specificity.</p>",

The area is low-lying and susceptible to the surge expected to impact New York later today or on Tuesday.</p> <p>Early on Monday morning, with Sandy still hundreds of miles away, it was easy to see why this area is so vulnerable. At the 8.31am high tide the Battery Park promenade - a popular tourist spot with its views of the Statue of Liberty and Governor's Island - was underwater.</p> <p>Rolling waves washed straight over the promenade wall, and by high tide water about 4 inches deep flooded the entire walkway. Not hugely dramatic just yet, but perhaps an ominous sign or what could be on store later.</p> <p>The walkway - normally packed with people jogging and cycling - was almost entirely deserted, save for a few journalists and the odd intrigued passerby.</p> <p>Mark Gluck, a professor at Rutgers University, cycles along Battery Park every morning, and wasn't about to let Sandy stop him.</p> <p>\"A bit of drizzle, a bit of wind, it's a perfectly fine day to go cycling,\" Gluck said, as water threatened to lap at his bicycle tyres. Gluck said he planned to cycle to the Upper West Side later today for lunch.

  "<p>Tracey Owings is fighting hard to keep the home that has been in his family for 34 years. In 2000 his mother refinanced. In 2006 she died. In 2009 he lost his job and had no paid work for nine months. He fell behind with the mortgage. The bank moved to foreclose on the house. Gradually the work came back. Less than before. Much less. But just enough. The house is not in negative equity and now he can make the payments. But he can't get the bank to take his money. Attempts to modify the loan and take advantage of a settlement, brokered by the White House, between mortgage companies and the justice department have come to nought. \"I don't qualify,\" he says with exasperation detailing both his efforts to meet each bureaucratic challenge and his frustration at each bureaucratic obstacle.</p> <p>He stands in the waiting room of Gulfcoast Legal Services offices in Sarasota with an armful of documents and a belly full of bile. \"They have failed me,\" he says. \"Obama came in offering hope and change but he's failed.

He had to go to the emergency room with injuries to his knee, back, elbow, shoulder and face and ended up in a wheelchair. It turned out Gladney, <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2009/08/10/55408/gladney-uninsured/?mobile=nc\">who had recently been laid off</a>, had no health insurance.

Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2006/sep/18/comment.usa\">why do poor people vote Republican</a>? The first thing to note is that <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/polls/#val=USP00p1\">most of them don't</a>. In 2008 73% of those who earned less than $15,000, 60% of those who earned between $15,000 and $30,000, and 55% of those who earned between $30,000 and $50,000 <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/154559/US-Presidential-Election-Center.aspx\">voted for Obama</a>. This year 57% of those earning less than $36,000 plan to vote Democrat as do 50% of those with a high school diploma or less. Even in deeply conservative Mississippi the overwhelming majority of the poor voted for Obama.</p> <p>Most of the clients I met in Sarasota's Gulf Coast legal centre struggling with the threat of repossession or foreclosure voted for Obama and will do so again. \"I'm for Obama all the way,\" says Betty-Jean Haines, the fate of whose home currently rests in the courts. \"He really wants to do something good but he's running into so many road blocks.\"</p> <p>The question of why poor people vote Republican is not simply an issue of income but primarily race and partly region and gender. Poor people may be more likely to vote Democrat; poor white people are not. In 2008 McCain won a slim majority (51%) of white Americans who earn less than $50,000 (this is just below the national median income which is not poor but the only figure available from exit polls that breaks down votes down by race and income), while Obama won a whopping majority of non-whites in the same category (86%). Asked in May which candidate would do more to advance their <a href=\" http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/romney-holds-key-advantages-among-financially-struggling-white-voters/2012/05/24/gJQACxPgoU_story.html\">family's economic interests</a> middle-class white voters who say they are struggling to maintain their financial positions gave Romney a 26 point lead over Obama.</p> <p>But that support is less pronounced among white women than white men and is not uniform across the country. In Mississippi 84% of whites who earn below $50,000 backed McCain: in Vermont 70% in the same category voted for Obama. Of the nine states that backed Obama in 2008 in three less affluent whites went for McCain, in five they backed Obama and one was a tie. In all of them non-whites voted Democrat.</p> <p>\"In Republican states, rich and poor have similar views on social issues,\" wrote Andrew Gelman, Lake Kenworthy and Yu-Sung Su in a paper, Income inequality and partisan voting in the United States, in the Social Science Quarterly. \"But in Democratic states, the rich are quite a bit more socially liberal than the poor. Factors such as religion and education result in a less clear pattern of class-based voting than we might expect based on income in- equality alone.\"</p> <p>The fact that race is a factor does not necessarily follow that racism is the driving force (more of that later) or that Obama's race is the principle motivating force. Things are more complicated than that. Gladney, for example, was black while many of the trade unionists he confronted were white. Race is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/09/us-most-racially-polarised-election-white\">so deeply embedded</a> in American history and culture that to talk of where politics ends and race begins sets up a false dichotomy. Since the end of the second world war Democrats have only once (in 1964) won the presidency with a majority of the white vote. A far higher percentage and number of whites voted for Obama than voted for Kerry.</p> <p>On some level explaining why poorer whites would vote for the Republicans demands a resource sorely lacking in American political culture at present \u2013 particularly during election time: empathy. There are <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/may/25/poor-white-voters-reject-democrats\">more to \"interests\"</a> than just the economic. If someone's core conviction is that abortion is murder or gay marriage is wrong then their decision to vote for a candidate who is against abortion or gay marriage is not an act of delusion but conviction. In any case working class white voters who <a href=\"http://publicreligion.org/2012/09/abortion-and-vote-choice-among-the-white-working-class/\">are against abortion</a> are significantly more likely to vote Democrat than their more affluent counterparts. So the economy still matters.</p> <p>But it is not the only consideration. In 2008 Obama won narrowly among people who earn $200,000 or more. Given his plans to tax high earners more heavily many of them were voting against their economic interests as do Warren Buffett, George Soros and all of Obama's wealthy funders. If poor states voting Republican is a paradox then the fact that 9 out of 10 states with the highest median income vote Democrat is no less so.</p> <p>Moreover some people, despite being poor, legitimately believe in free market and small government, even if it doesn't benefit them in precisely the same way that wealthy people may favour greater government intervention even if it doesn't benefit them. This partly describes the position of Mark Weaver,<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/16/colorado-working-poor-elections-2012\"> whom I met in Fort Collins, Colorado</a>, a few weeks ago. Weaver had been the chairman of Loveland chamber of commerce and effectively lobbied for the business community of northern Colorado. He was a registered Republican and evangelical Christian who lost his job and found himself visiting a food bank and now works at a book store where he makes $9 just so that he can get the healthcare benefits for his family. He changed his registration to independent on polling day.</p> <p>His political views are eclectic. He is for gun control and a more humane immigration policy and thinks unions are dinosaurs and is against abortion \u2013 thinks its preferable to get rid of it by changing peoples' hearts than the law.</p> <p>He doesn't like Romney and said he thought the 47% remarks merely confirmed his believe the Republican candidate was a snob. \"It doesn't surprise me about Romney because he's always struck me as a stuffed shirt. He's arrogant, and it's hard for me to get past that. It didn't change my mind about him because I always thought that about him.\" But when we met \u2013 a few hours before the first debate \u2013 he was still considering voting for him because he's concerned about deficit and thought Romney might do a better job. One could argue about whether his assessment of Romney's deficit-cutting plans are plausible. But one can't reasonably insist it wasn't a considered viewpoint.</p> <p>Finally, as Weaver's circumstances illustrate, poverty is not necessarily a permanent state. People fall in and climb out of it. Americans are particularly reluctant to describe themselves as even working class let alone poor. A Pew survey in 2008 revealed that 91% believe they are either middle class, upper-middle class or lower-middle class. Relatively few claim to be working class or upper class, intimating more of a cultural aspiration than an economic relationship. Amy Pezzani, the executive director of the Larimer county food bank in Colorado, explained that politicians are reluctant to refer to \"the poor\" and \"poverty\" because it turns low-income voters off. \"People who find themselves in these situations don't want to consider themselves poor. They're more likely to refer to themselves as the 'struggling middle class'.</p> <h2>'They say they want less help for themselves'</h2> <p>In<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/us/even-critics-of-safety-net-increasingly-depend-on-it.html\"> a report from Minnesota</a> earlier this year the New York Times examined the growing number of people who were simultaneously dependent on government aid and against more government spending. \"Many people say they are angry because the government is wasting money and giving money to people who do not deserve it,\" it concluded. \"But more than that, they say they want to reduce the role of government in their own lives. They are frustrated that they need help, feel guilty for taking it and resent the government for providing it. They say they want less help for themselves; less help in caring for relatives; less assistance when they reach old age.\"</p> <p>In a country where social mobility is assumed \u2013 even if it has in fact stalled \u2013 and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/apr/14/uselections2008.barackobama\">class consciousness</a> is week the poor may vote in the interests of an imagined, but not necessarily imaginary future, rather than solidarity based on shared economic hardships. A Gallup poll in 2005 showed that while only 2% of Americans described themselves as \"rich\", 31% thought it very likely or somewhat likely they would \"ever be rich\". No doubt that figure will have dropped since the crisis but it doubtless remains high.</p> <p>Indeed, so polarised is the nation's politics that <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/d59da0f2-1a41-11e2-9922-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2AN3o6jzv\">a recent poll from the Pew</a> research centre revealed that people's views on their financial situation are shaped by their partisan affiliation rather than the other way around. The survey showed show 55% of Republicans say their household finances are in worse shape than in December 2007 compared with only 40% of Democrats even if Republicans feel they are faring better financially than Democrats. \"People bring their own views of the president and partisan identification to these questions,\" Pew's Kim Parker told the Financial Times.</p> <p>In fact, the truly shocking thing about income and voting patterns in the US isn't the number of poor people who vote Republican but<a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Voter_Turnout_by_Income,_2008_US_Presidential_Election.png\"> the number who don't vote at all</a>. Inequality in income is intimately related to inequality in turnout. In 2008, 41% of voters who earn less than $10,000 voted; among those who earn more than $150,000 the figure was 78%. One can only assume that many poor people do not feel they have anyone to vote for. Shortly before the 2004 election <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/jul/26/uselections2004.usa6\">I met Cynthia Huntington in Maine</a>. She was 60 then and had a hernia, no health insurance and was in extreme discomfort. She was in two minds as to whether to vote Democrat (Maine could have been a swing state at the time) or for third party candidate Ralph Nader. \"They don't give a shit about us,\" she said. \"They're all rich people, and they're all run by corporations. They don't care about the fact that I need surgery and can't pay for it.\"</p> <p>\"You want to let Bush back in and make things even worse,\" asked her friend Gladys Pollard. \"Worse than what?\" asked Huntington. \"Kerry's not going to get me my operation.\"</p> <p>She did, eventually, vote for Kerry.</p> <p>When liberals depict the existence of poor white Republicans as an expression of mass idiocy and false consciousness they not only disparage poor white people, they provide conservatives with one of their key talking points which is that liberals are elitists who look down on poorer whites. The condescension is reminiscent of the musings of Ignatius J Reilly, the hapless protagonist of John Kennedy Toole's A Confederacy of Dunces, regarding African Americans apparent conservatism.</p> <p>\"In a sense I have always felt something of a kinship with the coloured race because its position is the same as mine. We both exist outside the inner realm of American society. Of course, my exile is voluntary. However, it is apparent that many of the Negroes wish to become active members of the American middle class. I cannot imagine why. I must admit that this desire on their part leads me to question their value judgements. However if they wish to join the bourgeoisie, it is really none of my business. They may seal their own doom.\"</p> <p>All that said, there are still some basic facts to contend with that do suggest many Republican voters believe things that are either misinformed or absurd or both. Since the last election the number of Republicans who believe Obama is a Muslim has doubled; in 2010 a poll showed that about two-thirds of Republicans either believe or are not sure that Obama is \"a racist who hates white people\", and more than half believe or are not sure that he was not born in the US and that he wants the terrorists to win. Earlier this year <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/security/2012/06/21/504201/poll-republicans-iraq-wmd/?mobile=nc\">a Dartmouth poll revealed</a> that 63% of Republicans still believe Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. A poll last year revealed that <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/content/slate/blogs/weigel/2011/03/15/only_25_percent_of_republicans_think_acorn_will_rig_2012_election.html\">a quarter of Republicans</a> believed a community rights organisation called Acorn would try to steal the election for Barack Obama, while 31% weren't sure whether it would or not. There was precious little chance of that, because Acorn no longer existed at that stage. It was defunded and disbanded after a successful sting operation by conservatives a few years earlier.</p> <p>Where breakdowns of these falsehoods exist those with less education are more likely to believe them. But even assuming they are evenly spread among poor and rich alike it would be fair to say that a significant number of Americans are working off faulty facts that would affect their vote. After all, if Obama really did want terrorists to win, hated white people and stole the election then it would be logical not to vote for him regardless of your race and income.</p> <p>Furthermore, most of these explanations regarding deeply held religious beliefs, class aspiration and political philosophy are no less of non whites than whites. Blacks and Latinos are both poorer and more religious than the nation at large and vote overwhelmingly Democrat. While racism may not be the primary motivating force behind poorer whites tendency to vote Republican it is certainly a factor.</p> <p>\"I voted for McCain,\" says Price in Kentucky's Floyd county as he snatched a cigarette outside the food bank. \"Because, well I voted for the old white guy. At least he's American.\" A few days earlier, the chairman of the Republican party in Jackson County, Arkansas, insisted electing Obama is destroying America in the same way electing Nelson Mandela destroyed South Africa. \"Handing it over to the wrong people.\"</p> <p>In Las Vegas shortly before the 2010 mid-terms I <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2010/oct/29/younge-america-great-divide\">met a woman protesting illegal immigration</a> outside an Obama event who was voting for the tea party candidate Sharon Angle. When it turned out she didn't have health care I asked her if that wouldn't be a reason for her to support Obama. \"I haven't really gotten into the whole Obamacare thing,\" she said. \"To be honest I can't even think about that right now. I'm so concentrated on the illegals.\"</p>",
  "<p>Bill Clinton spearheaded the drive to get the crucial youth vote out for the Democrats in swing state Florida on Monday, stepping in for the president to fire up a student audience by deriding Mitt Romney over climate change, student loans and an inability to do arithmetic.</p> <p>\"I have very strong feelings about this election. I'm not mad at anybody. Shucks, I don't mind Governor Romney for wanting to be president. I did too. But this is not about the candidates. This about you and your future,\" Clinton told a receptive crowd at the University of Central Florida in Orlando. \"It's about two very different approaches and which one is more likely to build a 21st century of the American dream.\"</p> <p>Clinton led the speeches after the president called off an appearance, no doubt aware that knocking Mitt Romney beneath a sunny Florida sky would not sit well next to news footage of much of the rest of the east coast drowning under Hurricane Sandy.</p> <p>Clinton told the students that the US has dropped over the past decade from second to 16th in world in the percentage of young adults with four year degrees.</p> <p>\"You know why, don't you? Because the cost of college went through roof and people got scared that if they borrowed the money they wouldn't be able to pay it back,\" he said.</p> <p>The former president said that the student loan issue alone is reason enough to vote for Obama because he is making them more accessible and reducing the cost.</p> <p>\"That means nobody will ever have to drop out of college again because of the cost of a college education,\" he said.</p> <p>It went down well with a crowd the Democrats need. </p> <p>Obama's victory in Florida in 2008 was delivered by college towns but opinion polls show a sharp fall in enthusiasm among the young compared to four years ago.</p> <p>Among younger voters, Obama crushed John McCain by 35 percentage points. The president still commands the bulk of the youth vote but a Harvard survey showed his advantage has fallen to 19 points.</p> <p>\"There really isn't the enthusiasm there was in 2008,\" said Dan Oldehol.</p> <p>\"There isn't as much change need. A lot of policies needed changing in 2008. There was sharper polarisation. He's had an OK four years but he hasn't had a brilliant four years.\"</p> <p>Still, Clinton hit the right buttons in reminding students that while there may not be the inspiration and vision of four years ago there is still a lot at stake.</p> <p>The former president sneered at Romney for saying he will scrap subsidies for solar companies and wind farms when coal and oil get subsidies that are proportionately just as large. He also took at shot at the Republican contender for questioning climate change.</p> <p>\"America is the only major country in the world where any major political party is denying climate change instead of arguing about what to do about it,\" he said.</p> <p>Clinton also derided Romney for \"failing the arithmetic test\", saying his economic numbers don't add up and that there was an \"unreal quality\" to the presidential debates.</p> <p>The former president emphasised solidarity.</p> <p>\"Countries that have polices that say we're all in this together work better than countries that say you're on your own,\" he said.</p> <p>Among those cheering was Steve Johnson, who two years ago was president of the Republican club at the University of Central Florida. Now he is voting for Barack Obama.</p> <p>\"I switched because the Republicans are looking after the upper percentile of the nation. Republican politicians just don't allow you to move forward. They say America is the land of opportunity but not with the Republicans,\" he said.</p> <p>Campus rallies are different. For a start, most others do not have thumping disco music at 8am. And free contraception is not generally a campaign theme hammered by the president's supporters at stops in Florida's retirement communities.</p> <p>Clinton added his own twist, boasting that Arkansas, where he was once governor, has the largest mascara plant in the world. But he said he personally has no need of it he's not in a punk band.</p> <p>Clinton ended with a pep talk on the president's healthcare reforms.</p> <p>Obamacare now entitles young people to remain on their parents' health insurance until 26 years old. Clinton said that Romney's claim that people don't die for lack of health insurance is not true. Study after study, he said, shows those with insurance see doctors sooner and live longer.</p> <p>Clinton said Romney wants to scrap the health reforms in order to enrich insurance companies.</p> <p>That's one of the reasons one of the students in the audience, Jonathon Hope, is voting for Obama.</p> <p>\"In 2010, 49 million Americans didn't have healthcare. That's what decided it for me,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Ukraine's president remains on course for an absolute majority in parliament after winning elections that international monitors criticised as a \"step backwards\".</p> <p>Yanukovych's Party of Regions and its allies were projected to get 240-260 seats in the 450-seat parliament following Sunday's elections, well ahead of the Batkivshchyna (Fatherland) party of the jailed opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.</p> <p>But the elections were also notable for the surprise breakthrough of a nationalist group called Svoboda (Freedom), which achieved 8% of the vote. More predictably, another opposition formation under the WBC heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko won 13%, meaning the boxer will now take his seat in one of the world's most combustible parliaments.</p> <p>The upshot is likely to be a parliament which, though sympathetic to the president, promises vibrant opposition.</p> <p>\"Our parliament will be definitely more pluralistic than the Russian one,\" said Oleksiy Haran, professor of political science at Kyiv-Mohyla Academy.</p> <p>But international observers said the elections were not as impressive as the vote two years ago that ushered Yanukovich into the presidency. Observers said the race was unfairly skewed in favour of the ruling party, citing Tymoshenko's absence from the elections, the diversion of government resources to help the incumbents and biased media coverage.</p> <p>\"Considering the abuse of power and the excessive role of money in this election, democratic progress appears to have reversed in Ukraine,\" said Walburga Habsburg Douglas, the special co-ordinator who led the OSCE election mission.</p> <p>Svoboda is believed to have cashed in on residual anti-Russian sentiment, particularly following a language law passed in the summer that gave more status to the Russian language. Many Ukrainian-speaking voters decided to vote for the Svoboda party, thinking it would be ready to protect the Ukrainian culture, analysts said.</p> <p>Oleh Taihnybok, leader of Svoboda, dismissed concerns that some in the party hold extreme nationalist views. \"We are no antisemitic, we are no xenophobic party,\" he told the Guardian.</p> <p>The political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko believes that thanks to Svoboda the new parliament will be even more turbulent than in the past. \"This party will add more pepper into the Ukrainian borscht,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>In 2012, a lot of people are using smartphones, tablets and/or laptops while watching TV. But how many, what are they doing, and what might it mean for the TV industry?</p> <p>It's a question being chewed over at pretty much every industry conference, and there is no shortage of research companies conducting surveys to try to help them understand viewer habits, and respond accordingly.</p> <p>I thought it might be a good time to round up some of the latest studies, all from 2012, and draw a few conclusions.

It also found that 22% of respondents have searched for something on their smartphone because they saw it on TV \u2013&#xa0;a figure that breaks down to 17% because of an ad, and 7% because of a show (obviously, there's an overlap).</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.ericsson.com/res/docs/2012/consumerlab/tv_video_consumerlab_report.pdf\">Ericsson (August 2012)</a></h2> <p>Ericsson's study of TV and video habits was based on its ConsumerLab research program, which involves interviewing 100,000 people a year in 40 countries.</p> <p>Its key finding was that 62% of people use social media while watching TV \u2013&#xa0;18 percentage points more than 2011's finding. 40% of them are discussing what they're currently watching on social networks.</p> <p>The report noted that social TV isn't just for the young folk: 30% of 45-59 year-olds \"engage in social TV behaviour at least weekly\".</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_GB/uk/industries/tmt/f0f3f07a77349310VgnVCM3000001c56f00aRCRD.htm\">Deloitte (August 2012)</a></h2> <p>Deloitte's survey of 4,000 people in the UK dug into second-screen habits, claimed that 24% of all respondents use second screens, although nearly half of 16-24 year-olds use messaging, email, Facebook or Twitter to discuss what they're watching on TV.</p> <p>It suggested there is a \"muted appetite\" for interacting with shows from the second screen, with only one tenth of respondents browsing the internet for information about the show they're watching.</p> <p>40% said they like being able to send comments in to a live show, but 68% said they wouldn't want websites for products, people or adverts that they've just seen on TV to \"automatically appear on their computer, tablet or smartphone\".</p> <p>Deloitte's response was that second-screening has much more of an impact on driving \"conversations about a programme, as opposed to interaction with it\", with the company's Paul Lee suggesting it will be similar to eating in front of the TV: \"An everyday experience for some; absolutely unthinkable for others.

  "<p>It was not as visually striking as the replica Eiffel Tower a few miles down the road but the office off Eastern Avenue, in the gritty part of Las Vegas tourists seldom see, was just as incongruous.</p> <p>Smack in the middle of a row of Latino-owned stores, many with Spanish names and piped Mexican ballads, a sign on the facade announced its mission in big blue and red letters: Romney. Stencilled beneath it: believe in America.</p> <p>When it first opened it was challenge enough for locals to believe in this apparition. Republicans, here?</p> <p>This, after all, was eastern Las Vegas, a sprawl of nondescript strip malls, dilapidated taco restaurants and low-rise, bleached apartments which immigrants called home and Democrats called a bastion. Republican canvassers were as rare as unicorns.</p> <p>\"This is pretty groundbreaking. We've recruited hundreds of volunteers,\" beamed Elsa Barnhill, 25, the Republican's Nevada state director for Hispanic outreach, seated inside the office. \"We are narrowing the gap. We are starting to erode the bad image we had.\"</p> <p>Four years ago Barack Obama won Nevada by 12 points, the sort of margin where votes are weighed rather than counted, but victory this time is not assured.</p> <p>Polls in the state give the president <a href=\"http://townhall.com/polltracker/candidatepollsummary/nevada-obama-vs-romney\">a consistent but razor-thin lead </a>over his Republican challenger.</p> <p>The reason was visible from Barnhill's doorway: several nearby stores were boarded up and abandoned, testaments to disastrous levels of foreclosure and 12.1% unemployment, the nation's highest, with unemployment among the state's Latinos even worse, at 19%. Nevada has been dubbed ground zero of the economic crisis.</p> <p>A block away Manny and Lilia Ceballos, a Hispanic couple and registered Democrats who run a bail bond business, said they would not vote for Obama again. \"The economy has suffered. We need change,\" said Manny. \"To vote for him again and expect a different outcome would be the definition of madness. Republicans are friendlier to small business owners.\"</p> <p>Emboldened by such sentiments Republicans are raiding this core Democratic constituency, blitzing Spanish language media with adverts, identifying and registering supporters at community events, erecting signs and billboards saying \"Juntos con Romney\", together with Romney.</p> <p>\"Obama tells these good stories but this ain't time for that,\" said Robert Zavala, 43, a Nicaraguan-born activist who spends his days erecting Romney billboards. \"We're like Catholic missionaries. I was in a pro-Obama bakery the other day explaining things and at the end they gave me a cookie. People are waking up to reality.\"</p> <p>Romney has visited the state six times since becoming the de facto nominee and dispatched his Spanish-speaking son Craig as a touring surrogate.</p> <p>\"We've been making important headway in the Hispanic community, which has been disproportionately affected by the president's policies,\" said Mason Harrison, a Nevada campaign spokesman who also worked here for John McCain's presidential bid.</p> <p>\"People are excited. We've made three times as many phone calls and knocked on five times as many doors as we did in 2008. For the first time we've opened an office in east Las Vegas, right in the belly of the beast. As a result, we're much closer to where we want to be. I think we're going to surprise a lot of people with our turnout.\"</p> <h2>'They're really going for it'</h2> <p>If Harrison is right, Nevada, with just six electoral college votes, could prove decisive. Having backed the winner in nine of the last 10 presidential elections it also boasts bellwether mystique: as Nevada goes, so goes the nation.</p> <p>Both sides agree Latinos, comprising 14% of the electorate, are crucial. In 2008 about 70% backed Obama, according to exit polls. Republicans know most will again back the president; the challenge is to whittle the margin so Republican bastions in rural areas, and their apparent edge in Washoe county, which includes Reno, will outweigh Obama's huge lead in Clark county, which includes Las Vegas and accounts for three-quarters of Latinos. Romney, analysts say, needs to bag at least a third of Latino votes to prevail.</p> <p>Hence the Republican outpost on Eastern Avenue and the unfamiliar spectacle of Republican party activists and newly formed conservative groups like <a href=\"http://nevadahispanics.org/home/\">Nevada Hispanics</a> canvassing in poor neighbourhoods.</p> <p>\"We've seen them out there. They're really going for it,\" said Leo Murietta, Nevada state director of <a href=\"http://mifamiliavota.us/\">Mi Familia Vota</a>, a non-partisan group which itself registered 17,301 Latino voters in Nevada.</p> <p>Will the Republican outreach prise this state, and possibly the presidency, from Obama?</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ralstonreports.com/\">Jon Ralston</a>, a prominent commentator and analyst, gave a blunt assessment. \"Mitt Romney is getting crushed here among Latinos, as he is elsewhere. You can't lose this demographic group by this size and hope to win the race.\"</p> <p>A poll last week <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/burns-haberman/2012/10/ppp-nevada-poll-obama-romney-147137.html\">gave Obama 69% support</a> among Nevada's Latinos and Romney 28%. </p> <p>Meaning there are precious few couples like the Ceballos, the repentant Democrats.</p> <p>The bright lining for Romney is Latinos lag other groups in expressed commitment to go to the polls. But in Nevada Democrats have racked up an impressive advantage in voter registration \u2013 120,000 in Clark county alone. \"If those voters turn out I don't see how Mitt Romney makes the maths work,\" said Ralston.</p> <p>With the state's economy so bad Obama should be reeling, he added, but Romney's stance on immigration during the primary campaign, when he tacked right to outflank rivals and opposed the Dream act, sabotaged his Latino outreach. \"He took a position that has come back to haunt him. You can't undo that in one election cycle.\"</p> <p>Latinos routinely rank jobs and healthcare above immigration in a list of concerns, stoking Republican hopes of making the election a referendum on the economy, but immigration was a \"trigger issue\", said Murietta, of Mi Familia Vota.</p> <p>Jody Agius Vallejo, a sociology professor and author of Barrio to Burbs: the making of the Mexican-American middle class, said latinos were diverse and potentially open to Republican arguments but they felt \"villainised\" by the party. \"Many Latinos, regardless of their national origin or immigrant generation acutely feel the waves of hostility.\"</p> <p>Romney's Eastern Avenue office was a lonely outpost. Next door Damaris Rosales, 25, had mounted an Obama poster at the entrance to her family's photo print store. Brought to the US from Mexico as an infant, her battle to be allowed to study and legally work had affected her extended family. \"They saw my struggle, saw what I had to go through,\" she said. Obama's support for Dream and his deferral of deportations for young Latinos salved disappointment with his administration's record level of deportations and stalled immigration reform, said Rosales.</p> <p>Diners tucking into $1.49 tacos at a nearby restaurant, Carniceria La Bonita, agreed. \"We all have siblings, cousins, friends, someone, who is undocumented,\" said Olga, 48, a Guatemalan-born cleaner who declined to give her surname.</p> <p>\"Walk down the street in Arizona and they can arrest you just for being Hispanic,\" said her partner, Edgar, 50, a landscape gardener. Neither had papers to vote but they said their children and siblings would vote for Obama. A Salvadorean at a neighbouring table said he \"would die for Obama\".</p> <p>The diners mocked Romney's Spanish language ads and his apparent spray tan for a Univision interview. \"Yeah, and now I'm a turkey voting for Christmas,\" said Edgar.</p>",
  "<p>A Channel 4 programme will make a stunning revelation at 9pm tonight: some people in Britain like to drink. According to the promotional blurb for <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/999-whats-your-emergency\" title=\"\">999: What's your emergency?</a>: \"With more than a quarter of adults drinking to hazardous levels, alcohol is a major factor in half of all crime and more than 70% of violent crimes, and costs the NHS \u00a32.7bn a year.\"</p> <p>I can confidently predict that the programme won't mention that <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11170814\" title=\"\">beer contributes \u00a35.5bn in duty and VAT, with spending on alcohol contributing \u00a314.6bn</a> in total to UK tax revenues, which is not too shabby. The programme will likely fail to point out that despite the liberalising of licensing laws, which was supposed to usher in a new age of chaos, for a number of reasons (economic, cultural, and social), <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-12397254\" title=\"\">alcohol consumption in the UK is still in decline</a> \u2013 not that you'd know it from media coverage.</p> <p>Of course, alcohol abuse can be damaging. But in the last few weeks alone we've had never-ending warnings from the Alcohol Health Alliance that middle-aged people <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9602154/Middle-aged-drinkers-unwittingly-risking-their-health.html\" title=\"\">who enjoy a glass of wine risk losing their health, homes and lives</a>; suggestions from the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19553239\" title=\"\">children's commissioner</a> that parents who drink too much be treated like drug addicts; and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-20035624\" title=\"\">calls by the Scottish parliament</a> to impose a minimum price on <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8464359.stm\" title=\"\">Buckfast</a> \u2013 a policy that for legal reasons is doomed to failure.</p> <p>The problem is, most of the arguments against alcohol are totally spurious. For instance, the idea that regular drinkers stand to lose up to 15 years of their lives \u2026 um, would that be the crappy bit at the end when we sit around in our own mess? (before you write in \u2013 not once have I ever sat round in my own mess. Not once).</p> <p>As a regular drinker since I was 14, I've paid in far more to the system than I've taken out. Alcohol is far more expensive in the UK than in most European states, yet we are told the only way to prevent us thirsty islanders drinking is to hike up the prices still further. The less we drink, the less duty will be raised; in other words, every time you imbibe you're helping reduce the deficit.</p> <p>Britain is a miserable enough place anyway; it's hard to comprehend how awful it would be without pubs, which according to Camra <a href=\"http://www.camra.org.uk/article.php?group_id=6095\" title=\"\">are closing at a rate of 12 a week</a>. We seem to be following the US toward a society where everyone's doped up on prescription pills yet anyone who has a glass of wine over supper is an \"alcoholic\". But how dull must life be to be in total control of your senses 24/7? As Frank Sinatra put it (probably after a few sherberts): \"I feel sorry for people who don't drink. When they wake up in the morning, that's as good as they're going to feel all day.\"</p> <p>Still unconvinced? Here's a completely non-partisan comparison. Famous teetotallers: Osama bin Laden; Mitt Romney; Tom Cruise. Famous drinkers: Winston Churchill; the great Georgie Best; legendary DJ Pat Sharp; Francis Bacon. I know who I'd rather have a pint with.</p> <p>Since taking my first drink, I've contributed in the region of half a million pounds to the UK economy \u2013 far more than I've taken out from the occasional visit to casualty. Despite drinking over the recommended limits for 30 years, I've somehow managed to work, write, travel the world and be (I hope) a good dad. In the Middle Ages, the human race would have been wiped out by the bubonic plague if people hadn't started supping mead; if it wasn't for alcohol you wouldn't even be reading this.</p> <p>As Homer Simpson puts it: \"To alcohol, the cause of and solution to all life's problems.\" I'll drink to that \u2013 in fact, I'll end here as I'm currently on a fact-finding mission in Ireland: it's 11am \u2013 they're open. Cheers!</p>",
  "<p>In ancient China, the arrival of a new dynasty was accompanied by \"the rectification of names\", a ceremony in which the sloppiness and erosion of meaning that had taken place under the previous dynasty were cleared up and language and its subjects correlated again. It was like a debt jubilee, only for meaning rather than money.</p> <p>This was part of what made <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/11/17/081117fa_fact_lizza\" title=\"\">Barack Obama's first presidential campaign</a> so electrifying: he seemed like a man who spoke our language and called many if not all things by their true names. Whatever caused that season of clarity, once elected, Obama promptly sank into the stale, muffled, parallel-universe language wielded by most politicians, and has remained there ever since. Meanwhile, the far right has got as far as it has by mislabelling just about everything in our world \u2013 a phenomenon which went supernova in this year of \"legitimate rape\", \"the apology tour\" and \"job creators\". Meanwhile, their fantasy version of economics keeps getting more fantastic. (Maybe there should be a rectification of numbers, too.)</p> <p>Let's rectify some names ourselves. We often speak as though the source of so many of our problems is complex and even mysterious. I'm not sure it is. You can blame it all on greed: the refusal to do anything about climate change, the attempts by the .01% to destroy our democracy, the constant robbing of the poor, the resultant starving children, the war against most of what is beautiful on this Earth.</p> <p>Calling lies \"lies\" and theft \"theft\" and violence \"violence\", loudly, clearly and consistently, until truth becomes more than a bump in the road, is a powerful aspect of political activism. Much of the work around human rights begins with accurately and aggressively reframing the status quo as an outrage, whether it's misogyny or racism or poisoning the environment. What protects an outrage are disguises, circumlocutions, and euphemisms \u2013 \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" for torture, \"collateral damage\" for killing civilians, \"the war on terror\" for the war against you and me and our Bill of Rights.</p> <p>Change the language and you've begun to change the reality or at least to open the status quo to question. Here is Confucius on the rectification of names:</p> <blockquote> \"If language is not correct, then what is said is not what is meant; if what is said is not what is meant, then what must be done remains undone; if this remains undone, morals and art will deteriorate; if justice goes astray, the people will stand about in helpless confusion. Hence there must be no arbitrariness in what is said. This matters above everything.\" </blockquote> <p>So let's start calling manifestations of greed by their true name. By greed, I mean the attempt of those who have plenty to get more, not the attempts of the rest of us to survive or lead a decent life. Look at the Waltons of Wal-Mart fame: the four main heirs are among the dozen richest people on the planet, each holding about $24bn (\u00a315bn). Their wealth is equivalent to that of the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/31/bernie-s/sanders-says-walmart-heirs-own-more-wealth-bottom-/\" title=\"\">bottom 40%</a> of Americans. The corporation Sam Walton founded now employs 2.2 million workers, two-thirds of them in the US, and the great majority are poorly paid people who feel intimidated and are often underemployed, and routinely depend on government benefits to survive. You could call that Walton Family welfare \u2013 a taxpayers' subsidy to their system. Strikes <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2012/10/10/walmart_workers_in_12_states_stage\" title=\"\">launched against Wal-Mart</a> this summer and autumn protested working conditions of astonishing barbarity \u2013 alleged abuses include warehouses that reach 48C (120F), a woman eight months pregnant <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/13/walmart-warehouse-workers-pilgrimage-photos_n_1881306.html?1347649325\" title=\"\">forced to work</a> at a brutal pace, commonplace exposure to pollutants, and the intimidation of those who attempted to organise or unionise.</p> <p>You would think that $24,000,000,000 apiece would be enough, but the Walton family sits atop a machine which appears intent upon brutalising tens of millions of people \u2013 the suppliers of Wal-Mart notorious for their abysmal working conditions, as well as the employees of the stores \u2013 only to add to piles of wealth already obscenely vast. Of course, what we call corporations are, in fact, perpetual motion machines, set up to endlessly extract wealth (and leave slagheaps of poverty behind) no matter what.</p> <p>They are generally organised in such a way that the brutality that leads to wealth extraction is committed by subcontractors at a distance or described in euphemisms, so that the stockholders, board members, and senior executives never really have to know what's being done in their names. And yet it is their job to know \u2013 just as it is each of our jobs to know what systems feed us and exploit or defend us, and the job of writers, historians, and journalists to rectify the names for all these things.</p> <p>The most terrifying passage in whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg's gripping book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/0142003425/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20\" title=\"\">Secrets: A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers</a> is not about his time in Vietnam, or his life as a fugitive after he released the Pentagon Papers. It's about a 1969 dinnertime conversation with a co-worker in a swanky house in Pacific Palisades, California. It took place right after Ellsberg and five of his colleagues had written a letter to the New York Times arguing for immediate withdrawal from the unwinnable, brutal war in Vietnam, and Ellsberg's host said, \"If I were willing to give up all this ... if I were willing to renege on ... my commitment to send my son to Groton ... I would have signed the letter.\"</p> <p>In other words, his unnamed co-worker had weighed trying to prevent the violent deaths of hundreds of thousands of people against the upper-middle-class perk of having his kid in a fancy prep school, and chosen the latter. The man who opted for Groton was, at least, someone who worked for what he had and who could imagine having painfully less. This is not true of the ultra-rich shaping the future of our planet.</p> <p>They could send tens of thousands to Groton, buy more Renoirs and ranches, and still not exploit the poor or destroy the environment, but they're as insatiable as they are ruthless. They are often celebrated in their aesthetic side-effects: imposing mansions, <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/08/30/100830fa_fact_mayer\" title=\"\">cultural patronage</a>, jewels, yachts. But in many, maybe most, cases they got rich through something a lot uglier, and that ugliness is still ongoing. Rectifying the names would mean revealing the ugliness of the sources of their fortunes and the grotesque scale on which they contrive to amass them, rather than the gaudiness of the trinkets they buy with them. It would mean seeing and naming the destruction that is the corollary of most of this wealth creation.</p> <p>Where this matters most is climate change. Why have we done almost nothing over the past 25 years about what was then a terrifying threat and is now a present catastrophe? Because it was bad for quarterly returns and fossil-fuel portfolios. When posterity indicts our era, this will be the feeble answer for why we did so little \u2013 that the rich and powerful with ties to the carbon-emitting industries have done everything in their power to prevent action on, or even recognition of, the problem. In this country in particular, they spent a fortune sowing doubt about the science of climate change and punishing politicians who brought the subject up. In this way have we gone through four \"debates\" and nearly a full election cycle with climate change unmentioned and unmentionable.</p> <p>These three decades of refusing to respond have wasted crucial time. It's as though you were prevented from putting out a fire until it was raging: now the tundra is thawing and Greenland's ice shield <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/greenland-melt.html\" title=\"\">is melting</a> and nearly every natural system is disrupted, from the acidifying oceans to the erratic seasons to droughts, floods, heat waves, and wildfires, and the failure of crops. We can still respond, but the climate is changed; the damage we all spoke of, only a few years ago, as being in the future is here, now.</p> <p>You can look at the chief executive officers of the oil corporations \u2013 Chevron's John Watson, for example, <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2012/04/13/chevron-boss-john-watson-made-25m-2011.html\" title=\"\">who received almost $25 million</a> ($1.57 million in salary and the rest in \"compensation\") in 2011 \u2013 or their major shareholders. They can want for nothing. They're so rich they could quit the game at any moment. When it comes to climate change, some of the wealthiest people in the world have weighed the fate of the Earth and every living thing on it for untold generations to come, the seasons and the harvests, this whole exquisite planet we evolved on, and they have come down on the side of more profit for themselves, the least needy people the world has ever seen.</p> <p>Take those billionaire energy tycoons Charles and David Koch, who are all over American politics these days. They are spending <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/03/koch-brothers-100-million-obama_n_1250828.html\" title=\"\">tens of millions of dollars</a> to defeat Obama, partly because he offends their conservative sensibilities, but also because he is less likely to be a completely devoted servant of their profit margins. He might, if we shout loud enough, rectify a few names. Under pressure, he might even listen to the public or environmental groups, while Romney poses no such problem (and under a Romney administration they will probably make more back in tax cuts than they are gambling on his election).</p> <p>Two years ago, the Koch brothers <a href=\"http://grist.org/article/koch-brothers-jump-into-prop-23-fight/\" title=\"\">spent $1m</a> on California's Proposition 23, an initiative written and put on the ballot by out-of-state oil companies to overturn our 2006 Global Warming Solutions Act. It lost by a landslide, but the Koch brothers have also invested a small fortune in spreading climate-change denial and sponsoring the Tea Party (which they can count on to oppose climate change regulation as big government or interference with free enterprise). This year they're backing a California initiative to silence unions. They want nothing to stand in the way of corporate power and the exploitation of fossil fuels. Think of it as another kind of war, and consider the early casualties.</p> <p>As the Irish Times <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2012/0620/1224318256659.html\" title=\"\">put it in an editorial</a> this summer:</p> <blockquote> \"Across Africa, Asia, and Latin America, hundreds of millions are struggling to adapt to their changing climate. In the last three years, we have seen 10 million people displaced by floods in Pakistan, 13 million face hunger in east Africa, and over 10 million in the Sahel region of Africa face starvation. Even those figures only scrape the surface. According to the Global Humanitarian Forum, headed up by former UN secretary general Kofi Annan, climate change is responsible for 300,000 deaths a year and affects 300 million people annually. By 2030, the annual death toll related to climate change is expected to rise to 500,000 and the economic cost to rocket to $600 billion.\" </blockquote> <p>This coming year may see a dramatic increase in hunger due to rising food prices from crop failures, including this summer's in the US midwest after a scorching drought in which the Mississippi river <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/07/16/520241/low-water-levels-on-the-mississippi-river-a-major-threat-to-commerce-this-is-absolutely-not-normal/\" title=\"\">nearly ran dry</a> and crops withered.</p> <p>We need to talk about climate change as a war against nature, against the poor (especially the poor of Africa), and against the rest of us. There are casualties, there are deaths, and there is destruction, and it's all mounting. Rectify the name, call it war. While we're at it, take back the term \"pro-life\" to talk about those who are trying to save the lives of all the creatures suffering from the collapse of the complex systems on which plant and animal as well as human lives depend. The other side: \"pro-death\".</p> <p>The complex array of effects from climate change and their global distribution, as well as their scale and the science behind them makes it harder to talk about than almost anything else on Earth, but we should talk about it all the more because of that. And yes, the rest of us should do more, but what is the great obstacle those who have already tried to do so much invariably come up against? The oil corporations, the coal companies, the energy industry, its staggering <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/10/24/1064231/three-ways-big-oil-spends-its-profits-to-defend-oil-subsidies-and-defeat-clean-energy/\" title=\"\">financial clout</a>, its swarms of <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/08/01/579101/jurassic-park-romneys-bush-era-energy-team-is-dominated-by-fossil-fuel-insiders-and-its-lobbyists/\" title=\"\">lobbyists</a>, and the politicians in its clutches. Those who benefit most from the status quo, I learned in studying disasters, are always the least willing to change.</p> <p>I'm a Californian so I faced the current version of American greed early. Proposition 13, the initiative that froze property taxes and made it nearly impossible to raise taxes in our state, went into effect in 1978, two years before California's former governor Ronald Reagan won the presidency, in part by catering to greed. Prop 13, as it came to be known, went into effect when California was still an affluent state with the best educational system in the world, including some of the top universities around, nearly free to in-staters all the way through graduate school. Tax cuts have trashed the state and <a href=\"http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175600/andy_kroll_back_to_$chool\" title=\"\">that education system</a>, and they are now doing the same to our country. The public sphere is to society what the biosphere is to life on earth: the space we live in together, and the attacks on them have parallels.</p> <p>What are taxes? They are that portion of your income that you contribute to the common good. Most of us are unhappy with how they're allocated \u2013 though few outside the left talk about the fact that more than half of federal <a href=\"http://nationalpriorities.org/en/budget-basics/federal-budget-101/spending/\" title=\"\">discretionary expenditures</a> go to our <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/defense-spending-broken-down-with-infographic-2012-6\" title=\"\">gargantuan military</a>, more money than is spent on the <a href=\"http://www.sipri.org/research/armaments/milex/resultoutput/milex_15/the-15-countries-with-the-highest-military-expenditure-in-2011-table/view\" title=\"\">next 14 militaries combined</a>. Ever since Reagan, the right has complained unceasingly about fantasy expenditures \u2013 from that president's <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/01/23/politics/weflare-queen/index.html\" title=\"\">\"welfare queens\"</a> to Mitt Romney's attack on Big Bird and PBS (which consumes <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2012/10/04/romney-promises-to-cut-taxpayer-funding-for-pbs-but-says-he-still-loves-big-bird/\" title=\"\">.001%</a> of federal expenditures).</p> <p>As part of its religion of greed, the right invented a series of myths about where those taxes went, how paying them was the ultimate form of oppression, and what boons tax cuts were to bring us. They then delivered the biggest tax cuts of all to those who already had a superfluity of money and weren't going to pump the extra they got back into the economy. What they really were saying was that they wanted to hang onto every nickel, no matter how the public sphere was devastated, and that they really served the ultra-rich, over and over again, not the suckers who voted them into office.</p> <p>Despite decades of cutting to the bone, they continue to promote tax cuts as if they had yet to happen. Their constant refrain is that we are too poor to feed the poor or educate the young or heal the sick, but the poverty isn't monetary: it's moral and emotional. Let's rectify some more language: even at this moment, the United States remains the richest nation the world has ever seen, and California \u2013 with the richest agricultural regions on the planet and a colossal high-tech boom still ongoing in Silicon Valley \u2013 is loaded, too. Whatever its problems, the US is still swimming in abundance, even if that abundance is divided up ever more unequally.</p> <p>Really, there's more than enough to feed every child well, to treat every sick person, to educate everyone well without saddling them with hideous debt, to support the arts, to protect the environment \u2013 to produce, in short, a glorious society. The obstacle is greed. We could still make the sorts of changes climate change requires of us and become a very different nation without overwhelming pain. We would then lead somewhat different lives \u2013 richer, not poorer, for most of us (in meaning, community, power, and hope). Because this culture of greed impoverishes all of us, it is, to call it by its true name, destruction.</p> <p>One of the great accomplishments of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/occupy-wall-street\" title=\"\">Occupy Wall Street</a> was this rectification of names. Those who came together under that rubric named the greed, inequality, and injustice in our system; they made the brutality of debt and the subjugation of the debtors visible; they called out Wall Street's crimes; they labelled the wealthiest among us the \"1%\", those who have made a profession out of pumping great sums of our wealth upwards (quite a different kind of tax). It was a label that made instant sense across much of the political spectrum. It was a good beginning. But there's so much more to do.</p> <p>Naming is only part of the work, but it's a crucial first step. A doctor initially diagnoses, then treats; an activist or citizen must begin by describing what is wrong before acting. To do that well is to call things by their true names. Merely calling out these names is a beam of light powerful enough to send the destroyers it shines upon scurrying for cover like roaches. After that, you still need to name your vision, your plan, your hope, your dream of something better.</p> <p>Names matter; language matters; truth matters. In this era when the mainstream media serve obfuscation and evasion more than anything else (except distraction), alternative media, social media, demonstrations in the streets, and conversations between friends are the refuges of truth, the places where we can begin to rectify the names. So start talking.</p>",
  "<p>Hurricane Sandy, the storm bearing down on the US east coast, strengthened on Monday after hundreds of thousands moved to higher ground, public transport shut down and the US stock market suffered its first weather-related closure in 27 years.</p> <p>Tens of millions of people have braced themselves for the arrival of the hurricane as the US National Hurricane Centre (NHC) said the Category 1 storm had strengthened as it turned towards the coast and was moving at 20mph. It was expected to bring a \"life-threatening storm surge\", coastal hurricane winds and heavy snow in the Appalachian Mountains, the NHC said. Nine US states have declared states of emergency.</p> <p>The hurricane, which has claimed 65 lives in the Caribbean, is also likely to play havoc with the US election, introducing a fresh element of uncertainty and disruption in the final days of the closely contested campaign.</p> <p>Forecasting services indicated the centre of the storm would strike the New Jersey shore near Atlantic City on Monday night. While Sandy does not pack the punch of hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005, it could become more potent as it approaches the US coast.</p> <p>Winds were at a maximum of 85mph, the NHC said in its 8am (1200 GMT) report, up from 75mph six hours earlier.</p> <p>New York, Philadelphia, Washington, Baltimore and Boston all lie in the target zone, but Sandy is likely to cause disruption across much of the US and officials warned it could cause power cuts lasting for days. \"The time for preparing and talking is about over,\" warned Craig Fugate, federal emergency management administrator. \"People need to be acting now.\"</p> <p>Barack Obama and Mitt Romney have both been forced to cancel events scheduled for Sunday and Monday, and the Obama campaign's \"early vote\" strategy is in danger of being thrown into disarray. Instead, the president had more pressing matters at hand, as he signed emergency declarations for the states of New York, Massachusetts and the District of Columbia.</p> <p>New York's mayor, Michael Bloomberg, ordered the evacuation of some 375,000 people from low-lying areas and public schools were told to close on Monday. For only the second time in the city's history, the subway system is to be closed. \"If you don't evacuate, you are not only endangering your life, you are also endangering the lives of the first responders who are going in to rescue you,\" Bloomberg said. \"This is a serious and dangerous storm.\"</p> <p>Although similar warnings of serious damage in New York last year turned out to be empty, people are taking few chances. Supermarkets were packed as customers stocked up, businesses closed early and nursing homes were being evacuated.</p> <p>Airlines cancelled more than 5,000 flights and Amtrak began suspending passenger train services across the north-east. Philadelphia also shut down its subways, buses and commuter trains and announced that schools would be closed on Monday. Boston, Washington and Baltimore also called off school.</p> <p>The US stock markets <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/29/us-stockmarkets-close-hurricane-sandy\" title=\"\">closed on Monday</a>, and will possibly close on Tuesday, with regulators saying the storm would make it difficult to ensure the safety of employees.</p> <p>Forecasters warned that at high tide, seawater could surge up to 3.4 metres above ground level in New York harbour. Obama urged those in the path of the storm \"to take this very seriously\" but expressed confidence that all emergency measures were in place.</p> <p>\"This hasn't hit landfall yet,\" he said. \"So we don't yet know where it's going to hit, where we're going to see the biggest impacts and that's exactly why it's so important for us to respond big and respond fast as local information starts coming in.\"</p> <p>The storm posed an additional challenge for Obama, who must balance his duties as president with his desire to get out on the campaign trail. After the US ambassador to Libya was killed in September, Obama was accused of quitting Washington too soon to attend a fundraising event in Las Vegas.</p> <p>After visiting the federal emergency monitoring agency, he headed to Florida a day earlier than planned to squeeze in campaign stops there and in Ohio before returning to Washington.</p> <p>Romney also abandoned campaign stops on the east coast but without presidential commitments he has been able to rearrange his schedule to continue campaigning elsewhere, chiefly Ohio.</p> <p>Obama's main campaign adviser, David Axelrod, told CNN no one knew how hurricane Sandy would affect the election. \"We're most concerned about people. This storm could affect 50 million people,\" Axelrod said. \"The best thing we can do is to focus on how we can help people, and hope it all clears out by next weekend.\"</p> <p>In New York, the aisles of Whole Foods Market in Tribeca, one of the biggest retailers in Lower Manhattan, were heaving with customers. Grace Lin, who lives just outside the evacuation zone, said she was taking in friends from nearby. \"There will be four adults and four children, and we are two adults and two children, so it's going to be pretty cosy,\" she said.</p> <p>Residents of the area had made similar preparations for hurricane Irene in September last year which ended up sparing New York City and leading to accusations of overreaction. But Lin said this storm appeared to be worse, and that she had particular concerns about power outages. \"People are taking it more seriously than last time. The biggest issue for our friends is the elevators not working, not the flooding.\"</p> <p>Not everyone planned to leave the recommended evacuation areas, though. Kevin Heeney, 28, was stocking up with bottled water, but had no plans to move out. \"We're going to stick it out,\" he said.</p> <p>Emerging from Whole Foods laden with bags of groceries, Danny and Laura Fletcher, a British couple who had just moved to the city, were sceptical of the reaction of New Yorkers. \"We've just bought a big roast lunch,\" said Danny Fletcher. \"I don't think it's going to be that bad. But it's panic stations in there,\" he said. Jonas Clark of Manchester Township, New Jersey \u2013 in the area where Sandy was projected to come ashore \u2013 stood outside a convenience store, calmly sipping a coffee and wondering why people were working themselves \"into a tizzy\".</p> <p>\"I've seen a lot of major storms in my time, and there's nothing you can do but take reasonable precautions and ride out things the best you can,\" said Clark, 73. \"Nature's going to do what it's going to do. It's great that there's so much information out there about what you can do to protect yourself and your home, but it all boils down to 'use your common sense'.\"</p>",

The \"super-storm\" is expected to veer left towards the east coast, colliding with wintry weather moving in from the west and cold air streaming down from the Arctic.</p> <p>\"It's a very, very large system,\" Rick Knabb, director of the National Hurricane Center, told Reuters. \"The storm is going to carve a pretty large swath of bad weather, both water and wind.\"</p> <p>New York, Philadelphia, Washington, Baltimore and Boston all lie in the target zone, but Sandy is likely to cause disruption across much of the US and officials warned it could cause power cuts lasting for days. \"The time for preparing and talking is about over,\" warned Craig Fugate, federal emergency management administrator. \"People need to be acting now.\"</p> <p>Barack Obama and Mitt Romney have both been forced to cancel events scheduled for Sunday and Monday, and the Obama campaign's \"early vote\" strategy is in danger of being thrown into disarray. Instead, the president had more pressing matters at hand, as he signed emergency declarations for the states of New York, Massachusetts and the District of Columbia.</p> <p>New York's mayor, Michael Bloomberg, ordered the evacuation of some 375,000 people from low-lying areas and public schools were told to close on Monday. For only the second time in the city's history, the subway system is to be closed. \"If you don't evacuate, you are not only endangering your life, you are also endangering the lives of the first responders who are going in to rescue you,\" Bloomberg said. \"This is a serious and dangerous storm.\"Although similar warnings of serious damage in New York last year turned out to be empty, people are taking few chances. Supermarkets were packed as customers stocked up, businesses closed early and nursing homes were being evacuated.</p> <p>Airlines cancelled more than 5,000 flights and Amtrak began suspending passenger train services across the northeast. Philadelphia also shut down its subways, buses and commuter trains and announced that schools would be closed on Monday. Boston, Washington and Baltimore also called off school.<br> The US stock markets will close on Monday, and possibly Tuesday, with regulators saying the storm would make it difficult to ensure the safety of employees.</p> <p>Forecasters warned that at high tide, seawater could surge up to 3.4 metres above ground level in New York harbour. In Lower Manhattan water was close to street level. One employee of an apartment building pushed a trolley of sandbags across the road to try to reinforce the defences.</p> <p>Obama urged those in the path of the storm \"to take this very seriously\" but expressed confidence that all emergency measures were in place.</p> <p>\"This hasn't hit landfall yet,\" he said. \"So we don't yet know where it's going to hit, where we're going to see the biggest impacts and that's exactly why it's so important for us to respond big and respond fast as local information starts coming in.\"</p> <p>The storm posed an additional challenge for Obama, who must balance his duties as president with his desire to get out on the campaign trail. After the US ambassador to Libya was killed in September, Obama was accused of quitting Washington too soon to attend a fund-raising event in Las Vegas.</p> <p>After visiting the federal emergency monitoring agency, he headed to Florida a day earlier than planned to squeeze in campaign stops there and in Ohio before returning to Washington.</p> <p>Romney also abandoned campaign stops on the east coast but without presidential commitments he has been able to rearrange his schedule to continue campaigning elsewhere, chiefly Ohio.</p> <p>Obama's main campaign adviser, David Axelrod, told CNN no one knew how hurricane Sandy will affect the election. \"We're most concerned about people. This storm could affect 50 million people,\" Axelrod said. \"The best thing we can do is to focus on how we can help people, and hope it all clears out by next weekend.\"</p> <p>In New York, the aisles of Whole Foods Market in Tribeca, one of the biggest retailers in Lower Manhattan, were heaving with customers. Grace Lin, who lives just outside the evacuation zone, said she was taking in friends from nearby. \"There will be four adults and four children, and we are two adults and two children, so it's going to be pretty cosy,\" she said.</p> <p>Residents of the area had made similar preparations for hurricane Irene in September last year which ended up sparing New York City and leading to accusations of overreaction. But Lin said this storm appeared to be worse, and that she had particular concerns about power outages. \"People are taking it more seriously than last time. The biggest issue for our friends is the elevators not working, not the flooding.\"</p> <p>Not everyone planned to leave the recommended evacuation areas, though. Kevin Heeney, 28, was stocking up with bottled water, but had no plans to move out. \"We're going to stick it out,\" he said.</p> <p>Emerging from Whole Foods laden with bags of groceries, Danny and Laura Fletcher, a British couple who had just moved to the city, were sceptical of the reaction of New Yorkers. \"We've just bought a big roast lunch,\" said Danny Fletcher. \"I don't think it's going to be that bad. But it's panic stations in there,\" he said. Jonas Clark of Manchester Township, New Jersey \u2013 in the area where Sandy was projected to come ashore \u2013 stood outside a convenience store, calmly sipping a coffee and wondering why people were working themselves \"into a tizzy\".</p> <p>\"I've seen a lot of major storms in my time, and there's nothing you can do but take reasonable precautions and ride out things the best you can,\" said Clark, 73. \"Nature's going to do what it's going to do. It's great that there's so much information out there about what you can do to protect yourself and your home, but it all boils down to 'use your common sense'.\"</p> <h2>October surprises</h2> <p>Hurricane Sandy has injected an element of unpredictability into a US election that had been proceeding along lines worked out by the Barack Obama and Mitt Romney months ago.</p> <p>But it is not the first time in US political history that bad weather or other unexpected vents have changed a campaign's dynamic. US journalists have since the 1970s have come to expect what they have coined as 'the October Surprise', first used in 1972.</p> <p>These October surprises have ranged from the revelation in 2000 of George W. Bush's arrest on a drunk-driving charge, to the appearance of an Osama bin Laden video in 2004.</p> <p>Sometimes the suprises are not confined to October. Romney fell victim just two months ago to a similar hurricane warning when he was forced to cancel the first day of the Republican convention in Tampa, Florida. Given that the convention as a whole suffered from bad reviews in the US media and he received no poll bounce from it, that may have turned out to be a plus rather than a negative.</p> <p>In the run-up to the 2008 election, the sudden economic collapse in September saw Republican John McCain suspend his campaign to return to Washington for an emergency meeting, forcing Obama to return too. That went badly for McCain as he had little to say in Washington.</p> <p>Even a day or two off the campaign trail can have an impact. Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern, fighting for the party nomination in 1972, seemed to have Ohio in the bag but may have lost it because of returning to Washington to deal with an issue related to the Vietnam war.</p> <p>No one can predict the impact of Hurricane Sandy on this election. What will play better? Obama being presidential in Washington, seemingly in command of the emergency operations, while Rommey continues campaigning? Or will Obama be unable resist the lure of rushing back to campaigning prematurely?</p> <h2>Trouble ahead</h2> <p>A stark warning has been sent out by the National Weather Service from Mount Jolly, in New Jersey. Speaking of the extreme danger of the coming storm and the strong possibility of serious damage, the statement said: \"If you are being asked to evacuate a coastal location by state and local officials, please do so.</p> <p>\"If you are reluctant to evacuate, and you know someone who rode out the '62 storm on the barrier islands, ask them if they could do it again.</p> <p>\"If you are reluctant, think about your loved ones, think about the emergency responders who will be unable to reach you when you make the panicked phone call to be rescued, think about the rescue and recovery teams who will rescue you if you are injured \u2013 or recover your remains if you do not survive.\"</p>",

He denied that his massive liquidity schemes and promise of unlimited bond purchases would fuel inflation.</p> <p>Draghi also rejected claims that the European Central Bank has violated its mandate, and argued that German savers should be pleased, not alarmed \u2013 taxpayers might even make a profit on the ECB's bond purchases.</p> <p>A full transcript of the interview was <a href=\"http://www.ecb.int/press/key/date/2012/html/sp121029.en.html\">uploaded to the ECB's website this morning</a>. It begins with Spiegel inquiring whether the ex-Goldmanite has any savings (!) before giving Draghi a vigorous grilling.</p> <p>Here are some highlights.</p> <p>On sovereignty:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>SPIEGEL:</strong> Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has proposed giving the EU Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs a direct say in national budgets. What do you think of that proposal?</p> <p><strong>Draghi:</strong> I am fully in favour of it. Governments would be wise to seriously consider it. I firmly believe that, in order to restore confidence in the euro area, countries need to transfer part of their sovereignty to the European level.</p> <p><strong>SPIEGEL:</strong> But it is precisely that that many governments are unwilling to do. Why are they so against it?</p> <p><strong>Draghi:</strong> A lot of governments have yet to realise that they lost their national sovereignty a long time ago. Because, in the past, they have allowed their debt to pile up, they now need the goodwill of the financial markets. That sounds like a paradox, but it is nonetheless true: it is only once the euro area countries are willing to share sovereignty at the European level that they will gain sovereignty.</p> </blockquote> <p>And on German fears:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>SPIEGEL:</strong> In Germany, people have several reservations about your crisis policies. Were you surprised to receive so much criticism?</p> <p><strong>Draghi:</strong> I had the opportunity of a very deep and wide-ranging exchange of views with members of the Bundestag last Wednesday. My impression was that I was able to explain a number of issues, in particular how the measures comply with our mandate to safeguard our independence and to ensure price stability in the medium term.</p> <p><strong>SPIEGEL:</strong> This fear stems from historical experience. Germans have learnt that, if central banks flood the markets with money, this always leads to inflation.</p> <p><strong>Draghi:</strong> We have to take these fears very seriously. But the correlation is not so simple. In some cases, such as in the Weimar Republic, printing money caused inflation. But in other cases, proactive central bank action did not.</p> </blockquote> <p>Draghi is clearly keen to assuage German concerns \u2013 last Wednesday he spent two hours at the Bundestag answering MPs questions. <em>Preparing the ground before Angela Merkel seeks parliamentary approval for new support for Greece, Spain and/or Cyprus, perhaps....</em></p> </div>   </div>",
  "<p>Joss Whedon, the creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, has given a backhanded endorsement to Mitt Romney's presidential campaign predicting it will usher in a \"zombie apocalypse\".</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://youtu.be/6TiXUF9xbTo\" title=\"\">a spoof video posted on YouTube</a>, the director of The Avengers backs the Republican candidate's programme of cuts that he says will turn the United States into \"a nightmare zombie wasteland\".</p> <p>Whedon, who describes himself as a liberal and a feminist and publically backs LGBT rights, including gay marriage, is seen stocking up on canned goods as if preparing for a disaster, as he explains his decision to shift his alliegiance from President Obama.</p> <p>\"Mitt Romney is a very different kind of candidate. One with the vision and determination to cut through the business as usual politics and finally put this country back on the path to the zombie apocalypse,\" he says.</p> <p>\"Romney's ready to make the deep rollbacks in healthcare, education, social services and reproductive rights that will guarantee poverty, unemployment, overpolulation disease and rioting. All crucial elements in creating a nightmare zombie wasteland.\"</p> <p>But it is Romney's support for \"ungoverned corporate privilege\" that Whedon predicts will plunge the economy into \"true insolvency and chaos\".</p> <p>Musing that no one can predict whether the zombie hordes will be the old school shuffling kind or the speedier type from 28 Days Later, he says: \"The 1% won't be the very rich.
