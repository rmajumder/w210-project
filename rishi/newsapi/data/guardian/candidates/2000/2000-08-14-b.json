  "<p>The curtain lifts today on one of biggest media circuses on earth: the Democratic Party convention in Los Angeles, held in a venue roughly the size of Crowborough, my home town in East Sussex. A substantial number of the journalists here are foreign, including a strong UK contingent. This event will be televised, broadcast and written about around the world. And I have the challenging task of trying to keep them all up to speed with what is going on. </p> <p>During the hectic round of primary elections earlier this year to choose the party's presidential hopeful, I worked with Al Gore's campaign team in Iowa and New Hampshire managing the foreign media. Something about the way I handled the seven Japanese media teams and the woolly-hatted Norwegian radio journalist who turned up with his broadcasting equipment strapped to his back expecting an immediate interview with the vice president must have struck a chord, because I've been invited back. </p> <p>My main role will be to advise the non-US media on what is happening when and where, on who is available for interview, and generally to keep them happy and on message. </p> <p>Presidential candidates today perform on a global stage. There are many votes to be won abroad. More than 1m US citizens live in the EU. There are 250,000 in the UK alone. This means putting in place an effective media management machine for the foreign journalist. Everything out here has to be done with pace and polish. When you are helping to get your man elected to what most consider to be the highest political office in the world you can't leave anything to chance. Fortunately \"our man\" has honed his media skills considerably during the gruelling primary races against Senator Bill Bradley. </p> <p>Last time, I watched him give 20 television interviews in 45 minutes without missing a beat. The cameras were set up in a strict pecking order and he calmly walked down the line giving each crew a couple of \"exclusive\" minutes before jumping aboard Air Force Two for his next campaign call. </p> <p>Good media management helped him to turn around a 5% opinion poll deficit to take Iowa and reverse Bradley's formidable 14-point lead to win in New Hampshire. Al Gore is not a man to be written off, whatever the polls say. No Democrat has won both the Iowa and New Hampshire primaries since Jimmy Carter did 26 years ago. </p> <p>Equally impressive is his wife, Tipper. Always upbeat and friendly, she is a real asset to her husband's campaign. The main challenge for the party machine this week will be to manage the presentation of the convention. By the end of the week Al Gore must bounce back in those all-important opinion polls. </p> <p>George W Bush finished the Republican Party convention 10 days ago with a \"bounce\" of just four points, taking his lead over Gore to around 14%. We were pretty pleased with that. In 92, after his convention, Bill Clinton bounced up 28 points against Bush senior but still only just managed to beat him in the autumn. </p> <p>US television coverage of both conventions is down by around two-thirds on normal years. Nevertheless, major sections of the coming days will go out live. In addition we will be putting out on the internet all the major speeches as they are delivered in the main hall. That will be a first. </p> <p>The UK media's role will be particularly interesting given that Los Angeles is eight hours behind London, making it possible for our papers to break stories before their counterparts in the US. </p> <p>Working here means learning a different language. Right now I'm off to \"get the juice\" (be fully briefed on fact, fiction and gossip) about \"surrogates\" (acceptable political stand-ins for media interviews) and possible \"goat fucking\" (minor dignitaries demanding to have their pictures taken with Al Gore.) The language in Crowborough is somewhat different.</p> <p>\u0095 Steve Morgan is managing director of Morgan Allen Moore, a public affairs company. He has taken a sabbatical to attend the convention</p>",
  "<p>Sitting opposite a sign on the wall of his office that reads \"The only safe thing is to take a chance\", and nursing a bottle of iced tea, is the man who could hold the key to the first US presidential election of the new millennium. Bill Hillsman, the maverick adman who created the \"best political commercial in history\" and who has been hired to run the presidential campaign of consumer advocate and Green party candidate Ralph Nader, is ready to throw some grenades into what has so far been a lacklustre race. </p> <p>\"We're really paying the price in this country for all these years of insipid political discourse and insipid political advertising,\" says Hillsman, sitting in the offices of the ad agency of which he is president in the Warehouse district of Minneapolis. \"Corporations are being blackmailed to give money. It's gotten to such a nadir that good people don't want to run for office any more.\" </p> <p>Hillsman is famous in the advertising business for masterminding the campaign that took the wrestler and Reform party candidate Jesse Ventura to the governorship of Minnesota and for a number of other imaginative campaigns for Democrats, such as Senator Paul Wellstone, that have made a virtue of operating on a tight budget. His very funny ad for Wellstone, which showed the candidate in pursuit of his embarrassed opponent, won the \"best political commercial in history\" award from readers of Campaign magazine. </p> <p>Around $250m will be spent this year by the candidates for the White House, with Gore and Bush each accounting for more than $100m. \"More and more money is being spent and fewer and fewer people turn out,\" says Hillsman, 47, a former journalism professor who comes from Chicago but has made his home and copywriting reputation in Minnesota. \"I'm not being paranoid, but the beneficiaries of this are the Democrats and Republicans, and the people who are in league with them. I've always looked for a term like the military-industrial complex to describe them, but it's the political consultancy industry in Washington which is... filthy, totally corrupt.\" </p> <p>Hillsman believes that the opinion polls which drive so much of political debate and strategy are skewed to benefit the two main parties and that political advertising is so poor partly because ad agencies make their money on a proportion - 15% - of what is spent on buying airtime; thus the more they spend on production values, the less they have to buy commercial spots and consequently the smaller percentage they get. Hence, according to Hillsman, the low and cliched standard of much political advertising: \"There's an inherent conflict of interest.\" </p> <p>The \"nadir\" of political campaigning - Hillsman, like a good adman, notes the pun - has led to Nader running. His campaign is already making waves, causing the Democrats to warn that if Nader does well - he is around 7% in the polls - he could let George W Bush into the White House by drawing votes away from Al Gore. Hillsman is not concerned about that scenario and has even offered the Democrats, for whom he has done much work in the past decade, his services to mastermind a negative campaign against Bush. It sounds as though he has already written his first draft. </p> <p>\"George Bush is a walking corporation who has never done anything in his entire life except to have people take care of him,\" he says. Bush has already spent around $60m. This week his campaign ads have shown him in an open-necked shirt mingling with students while he intones: \"It's easy just to spend more. Let's start by expecting more.\" </p> <p>The standard of political advertising is abysmally low, according to Hillsman. \"The people who practise political media consultancy really don't understand modern communications. They are using advertising theories that were de rigueur in the 50s and the 70s.\" The former style was the repeated mention of a unique selling proposition, \"the notion that if you kept hammering away [the message] would eventually bludgeon its way into people's consciousness.\" </p> <p>In the 70s, the style was to keep mentioning the brand name and focus on the \"pack shot\". Both methods, Hillsman says, are now off-putting to a visually sophisticated audience. \"I think it's insane. The prevailing philosophy seems to be that you can annoy someone into voting for you.\" </p> <p>What many, including Hillsman, believe were the most effective presidential commercials were those run for Ronald Reagan in 1984, shot on film using a big budget and creating a warm, feel-good, homy atmosphere under the slogan of \"It's morning again in America.\" Hillsman says of the mood in the ads: \"There would be a small-town parade; people would be running the flags up the flagpole. It was total propaganda but it was so well done that it was almost impossible to resist. Meanwhile, [Walter] Mondale was doing the same old crap and not breaking through at all.\" </p> <p>George Bush senior used negative ads to effect against Democrat Michael Dukakis in 1988, most notably with a commercial showing prisoners moving through a revolving door to create the impression of someone weak on crime, always seen as a vote-winning issue. Four years later, Bush was the victim when the Clinton campaign in 1992 mocked Bush's earlier claim of \"read my lips - no new taxes.\" But there are risks in negative campaigning nowadays. \"There is more backlash against it now; it's being put more and more under scrutiny by the press,\" says Hillsman. The real negative damage, he says, is now \"below the radar\", a tactic which Bush last used against this year's defeated Republican candidate John McCain. </p> <p>Al Gore's best bet, Hillsman believes, is to have a one-to-one debate with Bush. \"The Gore people are struggling. At this point they are really hoping that the [three planned live television] debates will be the turning point in which Gore [could exploit] Bush's lack of fire power upstairs. I would not do much different for Bush. I think they're doing a very adroit job of trying to move Bush towards the centre, a typical Republican strategy, trying to soften his image - compassionate conservatism - and totally ignoring the actual truth of the situation.\" </p> <p>He dismisses the Gore camp's claims that a Nader vote will be wasted, because the Nader voters, in Hillsman's estimation, come largely from the 50% of the electorate who do not bother to vote for a president: \"They don't accept the idea of voting for the lesser evil. They don't want to vote for evil at all.\" </p> <p>On other forms of reaching the electorate, he says: \"It's an open book on how effective the internet sites are going to be in politics.\" Those using the internet to gather information on politics, he says, are almost all independents. \"They don't believe the information they get from the two main political parties and they don't really believe the established media any more.\" He believes that this will aid the Nader camp. \"Because people have such a low opinion of politicians, you start below zero on the truth meter if you're a politician. In Ralph's case, you can't get him to not tell the truth. That's a powerful weapon. He is arguably the most trusted man in America.\" </p> <p>In the current Adweek, the industry paper, Debra Goldman asks: \"Can democracy withstand a campaign so excruciatingly long that voters die of boredom long before election day?... The budget of a third-world country has been poured into a campaign that no one is watching.\" </p> <p>Hillsman may have only around $5m in his kitty, but he is able to talk persuasively of how Nader could start to reach 10% in the polls, then 15%, then 18%, then... well, he does believe that the only safe thing is to take a chance. Come November, he could be the man exposing Bush's \"lack of fire power\" or the man who frustrates Gore. Either way, the scenery on the long and expensive journey to the White House should have become a little more entertaining - and the politics a little sharper.</p>",
  "<p>Judgments on the great figures of the day fall blithely from the lips of Joe Klein, without question the most widely-read political writer in the world: Clinton, Blair, Gore, Bush, Billy Bragg. </p> <p>Billy Bragg? Before Klein transcended the traditional parameters of his trade with Primary Colors, his best-selling satire on the Clintons, he wrote a book about Woody Guthrie, the ultimate expression of the hobo troubadour and an irresistible subject for an excavator of authenticity. </p> <p>Bragg, the unfashionably leftwing Bard of Barking, and the band Wilco used some of what Klein unearthed in two albums of Guthrie's songs. \"Bragg?\" Klein repeats over a glass (just the one) of top-shelf Belvedere vodka in the impossibly elitist lobby bar of the Four Seasons hotel in Manhattan. </p> <p>\"I love him as a singer, but I think his politics are anachronistic and kind of retro.\" Klein, who set off a manhunt unparalleled in the recent history of literature by publishing Primary Colors under the name Anonymous four years ago, divides much of the world into naughty boys and goody-goodies. </p> <p>Thus George W Bush, the man most likely to be the next president of the United States, was one of the boys at the back of the class hurling spitballs (weapons of derision fashioned from paper and saliva) at the irredeemably well-behaved stationed at the front. Al Gore, Bush's Democratic opponent, was one of those closest to the teacher. </p> <p>\"Bush is a very charming guy and very authoritative when it comes to things like baseball. But, you know, the other stuff...\" And Gore? \"Gore's a good boy, he's the one you hated in high school.\" Klein, who writes for the New Yorker magazine and says he does not have a cynical sinew in his short frame, brings his vast fascination for the exercise of power and the workings of culture to a panel discussion on political spin at the Guardian Edinburgh International Television Festival at the end of the month. </p> <p>His take on the art of spinning and its practitioners is simple enough: spin is dead, it's just that no one ever told the politicians who remain addicted to its use. </p> <p>\"Bill Clinton's not bad although he's had his truly awful moments. Who does not have a knack with spin, or didn't when I was over there in 97, is Tony Blair.\" Klein, who has written for the alternative press, Rolling Stone and New York magazine, was in the UK to cover the last general election. He considers the result to have been a victory for Labour substance over spin and a hapless Conservative party. </p> <p>\"Clinton is just perfect when people haven't told him what to say. He's brilliant at defending himself. But when he's on message - one of the most hideous, reprehensible terms of the spin era - he's transparent. </p> <p>\"And what Blair was doing in 97 was transparent: the same three market-tested words - opportunity, responsibility, community. Those are the ones that Clinton used in 1991. </p> <p>\"George W Bush ran for governor of Texas with a bus that said opportunity on one side, responsibility on the other. Folk here have caught up with the fact that they are being manipulated.\" </p> <p>Journalists, of course, are incorrigible know-alls and there are those who might question the analysis of a mere scribbler born 54 years ago in Queens, New York, and raised in an ambiance not unlike that seen in Woody Allen's movie Radio Days (Klein, naturally, has discussed the matter with the director). </p> <p>But the writer can claim solid credentials in nailing spin, even if he was not exactly there at its birth. It would be as well to define what it is we are talking about here, a word appropriated by Ben Bradlee, former editor of the Washington Post, when he would ask reporters what spin they were putting on their stories. </p> <p>\"Spin is putting your own favourable interpretation on the events of the day,\" says Klein, the sleeves of his blue blazer riding up his arms as he leans into the subject. \"Who invented political spin? It certainly existed when Louis XIV said 'I am the state.' I think it obviously existed in ancient Greece. You know that Moses was spinning like crazy in Exodus XIV through XVII when the Jewish people wanted to go back and become a place again because tramping through the desert was a bit too hard.\" </p> <p>Enter Joe Klein, many years later. \"I think I had a small part in the evolution - I think I coined the term spinmeister in New York magazine in 88. I was describing the scene after one of the presidential debates that year when each of the candidates had their spinmeisters working over the press. It seemed sort of ridiculous.\" </p> <p>And with that, apparently, the effective use of the device was dead, way before the laggardly British, for instance, had even acknowledged spin as an endemic feature of political life. </p> <p>\"A journalist asked one of the candidates in 88: 'who's doing spin for you?' And I thought, just as the mainstream press realised there was such a thing as hippies when hippies staged a funeral for the concept in San Francisco, it was time to bury spin then and there. The interesting thing is that the public is so much hipper than the politicians when it comes to this stuff. They know it when they hear it. They're sick of it. Enough already.\" </p> <p>Klein, himself a back of the class kind of guy, has a soft spot for the six US senators who served in the Vietnam war, the men who represent for him the Real Stuff, and not least among them John McCain, the Republican insurgent who momentarily derailed the Bush campaign. \"McCain is obviously very candid. Or at least he was until he started winning elections and then he became a little less so.\" </p> <p>Elements of these men coalesce in the character of the hero of Klein's latest book, The Running Mate, a very human senator from a mid-western state. \"The best spin is the appearance of the absence of spin. It's genuineness. It's authenticity. One of my favourite political stories involves Bob Kerrey, who was governor of Nebraska in the 80s and he was dating Debra Winger, the actress, and at one point the local media found out that she was spending nights at the governor's mansion. </p> <p>\"Kerrey received the Congressional medal of honour, which is the highest award, and he lost much of a leg in Vietnam. And the press sets upon this poor guy, screaming at him 'How dare you. We understand that you've been sleeping with Debra Winger in the governor's mansion.' And he shrugs his shoulders and says 'what can I say? She swept me off my foot.' That'll turn my head every time. I'll give that guy the benefit of the doubt in a heartbeat. I'm in favour of politicians having extra-marital relationships. Oh yeah. It makes them more understanding of the flaws that the rest of us have.\" </p> <p>Klein was considered by many friends and colleagues to have revealed a flaw in the course of what might be termed his extra-journalistic relationship with the media when he denied that he was Anonymous. For six months he dismissed attempts at identification until an analysis of his handwriting on the manuscript made his authorship undeniable. </p> <p>The gimmick and the thrill of the chase drove Primary Colors to the top of the best-seller lists but Klein says that at the time there was no sign of what he was getting himself into. \"We had no idea that it was going to take off the way it did. It was a surprise to Random House. They were lowering the print run right up to the minute of publication. </p> <p>\"My best-case scenario was that it might spend a week or so on the best-seller list and that it would be a fun guessing-game in Washington and all my friends would guess that it was me within the first week, despite my proforma denial. Then it comes out and people in the White House start accusing each other of having written it and I think 'My God, this must be a lot closer than I thought it was'.\" </p> <p> Suddenly, the unmasked Klein was being told that he was now a professional celebrity, that he had been granted entrance to the parallel televisual universe composed of what he divines as a kaleidoscope of mindless rot. He eschewed the opportunity, turning down invitations to all the parties and declining to appear on the screen throughout the Lewinsky affair. </p> <p>At least he had a choice, an option not open to his strolling players, the politicians who must compete on the same stage as every other attention-seeker, a stage designed for everything from the voyeuristic TV show Survivor, through Eminem, Hollywood and the Olympics. </p> <p>\"I guess at least the mindless rot is delivered with a kind of wink. But when Tony Blair says this is not a day for soundbites and then delivers one, there's no wink involved. That's always been one of the great disappointments of Clinton: that a man that intelligent would have so little sense of irony. </p> <p>\"Spin has just become less effective. As soon as it was named it was over. They don't know. They certainly believe that it's real, that it's their job. They have absolutely no perspective, no distance, on what they are doing.\" </p>",
  "Democrats begin their convention in the entertainment capital of the world today amid renewed signs that Senator Joe Lieberman, a persistent Hollywood critic, holds the key to the party's dream of holding on to the White House after the stormy Clinton-Gore years. <p>An NBC opinion poll published yesterday shows that Al Gore has narrowed George W Bush's lead to just three points - 44% to 41% - in this year's presidential race. While other recent polls suggest Mr Bush's lead could be as much as 10 points, Mr Gore's selection of Mr Lieberman as his vice-presidential running-mate last week has clearly stopped the slide to the Republicans. </p> <p>Nearly a quarter of voters polled said they now felt more favourable towards Mr Gore because of his choice of the first Jew to be nominated on the presidential ticket of a major American political party. </p> <p>But it was Mr Lieberman's stance as a critic of the moral values of the television, music and movie industries - and of President Clinton - which was in the spotlight yesterday as the senator was given pride of place in the Gore campaign's weekend strategy. </p> <p>The contrast between Mr Lieberman's moral strictures and the intensive Democratic fundraising effort in Hollywood this week could hardly be greater. </p> <p>The start of the convention has been dominated by the presence in Los Angeles of Bill and Hillary Clinton, both of whom will address the convention tonight, and who have spent the weekend raising millions of dollars for their own projects from big name donors. </p> <p>The wider issue in Los Angeles is whether the convention marks the end of a decade in Democratic politics in which the party has moved sometimes unwillingly into the centre, campaigning against some of its traditional ideas in an attempt to outmanoeuvre the Republicans, a form of politics at which Mr Clinton has excelled. </p> <p>The build-up to the convention has been overshadowed by a row over Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez's wish - now thwarted by the Democratic high command - to hold a fundraising event at Hugh Hefner's Playboy Mansion. </p> <p>Pre-convention tension increased yesterday when a demonstrator slipped through the city's huge police cordon and dump a vanload of manure outside a downtown hotel. Convention organisers are nervous that protests planned here this week could steal the headlines from the politicians. </p> <p>Mr Gore is taking a calculated risk that he is better off spending the early part of the convention campaigning in Pennsylvania and the Midwest. The vice-president spent yesterday working on his acceptance speech, which he will deliver in Los Angeles on Thursday night, after meeting Mr Clinton for a \"passing the torch\" event in Michigan mid-week. </p> <p>\"I'm going to talk about what I am recommending for the future, and in doing so I'm going to talk about how my proposals are rooted in the experiences I have had over the last quarter century, especially fighting for working families,\" Mr Gore said yesterday. </p> <p>Whether he wants to be or not, Mr Clinton was the centre of attention in Los Angeles at the weekend. In deference to Mr Gore, the president cancelled three media interviews, including one with the New York Times, in an attempt to adopt a lower profile. But there was no getting away from the Clinton circus. . </p> <p>Yesterday Mr Clinton was the guest of honour at a Malibu brunch hosted by Barbra Streisand, which was expected to raise $10m (\u00a36m) for his presidential library project. On Saturday night he was a speaker at a glitzy fundraiser for Hillary's New York senate campaign, where the line-up included appearances by Shirley MacLaine, Diana Ross, Cher, and John Travolta, as well as the legendary civil rights activist Rose Parks. </p> <p>Convention organisers insist that their week in the limelight will be much fuller of policy than the Republican convention in Philadelphia two weeks ago. Mr Gore told reporters his speech would be \"on substance not a big show\". Nevertheless, the centrepieces will be the evening sessions which are broadcast nationwide on television. After the Clintons this evening, tomorrow night will feature Senator Bill Bradley and Caroline Kennedy, the only surviving child of President John Kennedy, who was nominated for the presidency in 1960, the last time that either party held a convention in Los Angeles. </p> <p>On Wednesday, the focus will shift towards this year's nominees, with Mr Lieberman addressing the convention on Wednesday, along with Mr Gore's daughter Karenna Schiff. Then on Thursday, Tipper Gore will introduce her husband, who will deliver his acceptance speech.</p>",
  "President Clinton's dilemma over whether to press ahead with a $60bn (\u00a340bn) missile defence system intensified yesterday with claims that the US covered up the loss of a nuclear bomb near an airbase that would form part of the shield. <p>One of four hydrogen bombs on a B52 aircraft that crashed several kilometres off the Thule airbase in Greenland was probably never recovered, according to classified documents. </p> <p>\"US authorities hid the disappearance of this nuclear bomb on Danish territory from the Danish authorities,\" said Mogens Bosen, leader of a group of employees on the airbase. Denmark handles Greenland's foreign, security and defence policy. </p> <p>\"Detective work by former Thule workers indicates an unexploded nuclear bomb probably still lies on the seabed off Thule,\" said the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten. </p> <p>Denmark was not told about the missing bomb but the air crash 32 years ago still caused a rift in relations between the US and its Nato ally at the time. </p> <p>The US secretly stored about 12,000 nuclear weapons in 18 countries and nine territories at the height of the cold war, including several that forbade the practice, including Japan, Taiwan and Greenland. </p> <p>An official report on the accident, obtained by the Thule staff, said nothing was found of the bomb other than a parachute. But a state department document on the crash, dated five months later, said all the weapons on the crashed bomber had been accounted for, without specifying whether that meant they had been recovered. The US told the Danish government that clean-up work had been completed and abandoned the search for the bomb, said the newspaper. </p> <p>Politicians in Greenland were opposed to making Thule a link in the missile defence chain even before the latest allegations, which will not assist the cause of senior state department officials who will go there in seven days time to discuss the airbase's putative role in the shield. </p> <p>The claims come when President Clinton is under pressure to decide whether to go ahead with a national missile defence shield aimed at thwarting \"rogue\" nations, under which definition it includes North Korea, Iraq, Iran and Libya. </p> <p>US intelligence believes that by 2005 North Korea will have a missile capable of reaching North America. Mr Clinton is being pressed by the scheme's advocates to approve the first step, approval of a radar installation in Alaska, by the autumn if the 2005 deadline is to be met. </p> <p>But the system has failed in two of its three tests - the most recent was last month - and has united many of the firm and more tentative friends of the US in opposition to it. Russia says it breaches the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty, China fears that its limited supplies of the weapon would be negated, and European allies believe world stability would be damaged. </p> <p>But Mr Clinton, in the final months of his presidency, is important now only to the timing of the missile system and the candidates to succeed him have been vying to outdo each other in their enthusiasm for it. </p> <p>George W Bush, 10 points ahead in the latest poll, told the Republican convention where he accepted his nomination: \"At the earliest possible date, my administration will deploy missile defences to guard against attack and blackmail. Now is the time not to defend outdated treaties but to defend the American people.\" </p> <p>His opponent, vice-president Al Gore, has said: \"We must adequately prepare for homeland defence, protecting critical infrastructure, combating terrorism and developing the technology for a national missile defence system to protect against ballistic missile attacks from rogue nations.\" </p> <p>The Pentagon said a week ago it was still assessing the latest failed test, when the projectile that was meant to take out a warhead failed to separate from its booster rocket. Defence secretary Bill Cohen said he would brief Mr Clinton \"within the next few weeks\". </p> <p>US authorities would say nothing yesterday about the crashed B52 or the missing bomb.</p>",
  "<p>Al Gore and George W Bush are the Tweedledum and Tweedledee of politics. Two spoiled little rich boys, they are the antithesis of the log-cabin-to-White House ethos that has underpinned America's meritocratic democracy since the days of Abe Lincoln. Both are using the power of privilege and big corporate money to compensate for their mediocrity, both stand for precisely the same inconsequential things. </p> <p>If Gore imagined that he could surf to power on the back of the strength of the US economy, he has been rudely awakened. For him, this is crunch time; he needs this week's Democratic convention to put some oomph into his dreary campaign. There is broad agreement that Gore's priority is to beat back Bush's invasion of the middle ground of American politics, where the Republicans have made a beach-head with their appeal to a \"caring conservatism\". </p> <p>It is now the accepted norm that this strategy is the only way to win elections, not just in America but in Britain as well. According to this theory, the death of class as an economic force means that class politics are also dead. The days when politicians like Roosevelt or Truman could appeal to a natural working class constituency are gone. We are all middle class now, and that requires parties to hug the centre ground and pay as much attention to lifestyle as to economics. </p> <p>This is a beguiling notion, particularly for those who have done splendidly well out of the status quo of the past two decades, because it means that nothing ever really changes, or needs to change. Yes, of course, there is a bit of tinkering around at the edge when a Democrat is in the White House, but nothing that would put the wind up Wall Street. As the American economist Robert Pollin said in a recent New Left Review: \"The core of Clinton's programme has been global economic integration, with minimum interventions to promote equity in labour markets or stability in financial markets. Gestures to the least well-off have been slight and back-handed, while wages for the majority have either stagnated or declined. Wealth at the top, meanwhile, has exploded.\" </p> <p>Clinton, according to Pollin, has presided over a country which has experienced greater poverty and lower real wages than under Richard Nixon, which may explain why Gore is having so much trouble enthusing his party. Under Democrats and Republicans, the centre of gravity of politics has moved steadily to the right. </p> <p>But the political strategy only really makes sense if the basic premise - that class no longer matters - is correct. Our own Industrial Society published an example of the new thinking a couple of weeks ago, claiming that Britain was now teeming with free workers. \"Three transformations - the waves of white collar downsizing in the 80s and 90s, the rise in the proportion of value added by skilled workers and the explosion of IT - have combined to create a fertile breeding ground for a new kind of worker. Hearts hardened by the decline of corporate job protection, these workers are demanding, mobile and self-reliant. They are high on human capital and low on loyalty.\" </p> <p>Now, banish from your mind any unworthy thought that the author of this breathless prose has to be a) male, b) white, c) university educated, and d) part of the metropolitan in-crowd. Ask the question: is it really true that the working class no longer exists? </p> <p>For all the talk, America actually remains a country in which the clear majority of people are working class. When asked, 55% of Americans said they were working class, which pretty much tallies with an occupational breakdown of the US jobs market. The US department of labour's projection for the 10 occupations that would offer the most new jobs in the first years of the millennium were cashiers, janitors and cleaners, retail salespersons, waiters and waitresses, registered nurses, general managers and top executives, systems analysts, home health aides, guards, and nurses aides, orderlies, and attendants. Not much sign of the end of the working class there. </p> <p>The picture is much the same in Britain. There has been a modest increase in the number of managers and professionals, but the government's own figures show that Britain is a nation of tradesmen, secretaries, machine operatives and care workers rather than a nation of \"free workers\". </p> <p>Class only ceases to matter in the workplace if it is assumed that class is linked to whether you are employed in a blue collar or white collar job. But in reality class is not about whether you can wear what you like to the office, or whether your boss lets you dress down on Fridays. It is about power. </p> <p>Michael Zweig says in his new book The Working Class Majority*: \"Our society's growing inequality of income and wealth is a reflection of the increased power of capitalists and the reduced power of workers. In the last two decades the working class has experienced lower real incomes, longer hours at work, fewer protections by unions or government regulations, and inferior schools.\" </p> <p>Zweig's argument is that the political power of the economic elite is at least as great as it was in the 1920s, and perhaps even greater since it is no longer effectively challenged by other class interests. His view is that the Third Way does not amount to an effective defence of working class interests. The elite likes Clinton because he poses no real threat. </p> <p>But isn't it the case that the standards of living of working people have increased dramatically in the past 50 or 100 years? Isn't it true that capitalism has delivered not just for the capitalists but for everybody? This is a reasonable point, and it is true that the spread of home and car ownership, the increase in overseas travel and the blanket coverage of many consumer durables mean that the sort of lifestyle that was only available to a small minority in mid-century is now enjoyed by large chunks of the working class. </p> <p>Zweig's first point is that everybody has seen their living standards rise over the past 50 or 100 years, and that there is scant evidence that the working class has caught up with the middle class, let alone the capitalist class. Secondly, working class families have improved their lot when they have been able to take home in higher pay (or shorter working hours) a share of the increased wealth they have created through their higher productivity. As the graph shows, in the post-war period up to 1972, real wages rose in line with productivity. After 1972, productivity and output carried on rising but real wages fell for a quarter of a century until starting to rise again in 1997 as America returned to full employment. Instead of being captured by workers, America's productivity gains were captured by capital. </p> <p>Nor is this picture likely to change much. It is in the interests of the Republicans and the Democrats, reliant as they are on big business funding to give the impression that everybody is now on the same side. So while Clinton has nudged up the level of the minimum wage and raised the earned income tax credit, he has done nothing to change the power dynamics of the American economy. </p> <p>None of this means that Gore is doomed. Given that Bush appears to be a couple of spare ribs short of a barbecue, the Democrats still have a good chance of victory. But apathy will be the real winner. Gore might argue that America's working people simply do not grasp what their leaders are doing. The reality is that America's working class seems to understand only too well. </p> <p> *Michael Zweig: The Working Class Majority; ILR/Cornell University Press.</p>",
  "The banner spells out the theme of the gathering: \"Whoever they vote for, we are ungovernable\". <p>While the Democrats assemble downtown for the razzmatazz coronation of Al Gore and the Reform party disperses in chaos in Long Beach, the North American Anarchist Conference has been meeting quietly at the weekend in a crowded studio just north of Dodger Stadium, the home of one of Los Angeles's baseball teams. </p> <p>For the coming week Los Angeles will be the focal point of US protest, and the American anarchists have a tradition of involvement in such battles, stretching back to the beginning of the last century. </p> <p>This has made them suspicious of the police and the media, and many of those on the door at the studio building have obscured their faces with Zapatista-style bandanas and wear badges naming them as Idiot, Corpse, Sativa or Stream. </p> <p>There are many young activists in black T-shirts with badges honouring everything from the anarchist band, Crass, to the Industrial Workers of the World, better known as the Wobblies. </p> <p>Cameras and tape-recorders are banned, and everywhere notices warn of the possibility of police infiltrators or raids. No drugs, alcohol or weapons are permitted. \"Nothing that will endanger the safety and security of others\" is allowed. </p> <p>The first discussion of the day is not on plans for this week's street protests but on Liberation Pedagogy, including suggestions that children should be encouraged not to go to school until the system has changed. But the 500 or so anarchists assembled here, split fairly equally between the sexes, are aware that the media are focused mainly on the part their members will play in the street protests. </p> <p>\"What happened in Seattle grabbed a lot of attention,\" said a young Asian-American with a Meat is Murder tattoo on his arm, who asked to be identified as Vegetarian Peace Punker. \"I think a lot of people in Los Angeles know that there are protests going on, but [they] don't know why. </p> <p>\"I think all the issues being raised [globalisation, drugs laws, racism, poverty, corporate funding of politics] are equally important.\" </p> <p>Jay Brophry, an LA engineer who broadcasts on the illegal anarchist station, Radio Clandestino, said that one of the main problems was explaining to people what their message was. </p> <p>\"A lot of people get their news from television and don't realise that, for instance, what happened in Seattle was that the police rioted and the demonstrators reacted. The impression they got from television was the opposite of what really happened. </p> <p>\"We are in a historical period when the nation state is being overwhelmed by the corporate state,\" he said. \"Decisions are being made by the WTO, who no one elected.\" </p> <p>Anarchists say they have had a problem getting their message across partially because the media ignored them unless there was violence. </p> <p>However, many of those present in Los Angeles were aware that they were being painted by the police as the potential sources of violence on the streets and are increasingly careful not to give credence to that image. </p> <p>The conference's organisers say they have been heartened by a growing interest in the movement, particularly on the US west coast. </p> <p>The anarchists are just one of the dozens of groups which will take to the streets of Los Angeles this week, but they know that their symbol, the anarchist A in a circle, will attract particular attention.</p>"
