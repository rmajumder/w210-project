  "<p>The two main nursing journals could not have treated it more differently. Christine Hancock, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), had been nominated for election as president of the International Council of Nurses and was the sole nominee, said a brief item in last week's Nursing Standard, the college's magazine. \"Hancock looks set to quit RCN,\" ran the headline in the independent Nursing Times. </p> <p>Hancock has been the college's general secretary for more than a decade and her departure would be no great surprise. But she, and the rest of the RCN's leadership, will not have welcomed the outbreak of speculation about her future at what is a critical juncture for the college itself and nursing as a whole. </p> <p>On the national stage, nursing has its tail up. As the medical profession's stock has sunk ever lower, so nursing has been seized on and promoted by ministers as the patient and voter-friendly alternative. But nurses are waiting for Labour to deliver - on staff numbers, pay and, most importantly, power - and Hancock knows the pressure has to be kept up. </p> <p>Within the RCN, meanwhile, decisions are about to be taken on key issues. Voting ends today in a three-way membership ballot on the college's presidency, with the incumbent Christine Watson facing challenges from Roswyn Hakesley-Brown and, for a second successive year, Ray Rowden, the high profile NHS commentator, who is promising to shake up \"the closed and elitist culture of the nursing hierarchy\". Next month, voting will close on two highly controversial issues. The college's 325,000 members are being asked to agree to a hefty 29% rise in subscriptions, and to make a change to the RCN constitution to allow some healthcare assistants into a special category of membership. </p> <p>This is by no means the first time that the leadership has sought to win acceptance of those who are not qualified nurses or students. And resistance continues to be fierce: at the college's annual congress earlier this year, the move to reopen the issue was passed by a majority of just 5%. But the rise of the healthcare assistant, increasingly taking over less skilled nursing tasks and increasingly holding vocational qualifications, makes the membership question an urgent one. </p> <p>If the leadership wins the vote, to be announced at the RCN's annual general meeting on October 18, it will be a considerable feather in Hancock's cap. And it will undoubtedly prove more significant for the college than another vote with which she is already inescapably associated: the decision, in 1995, to tear up its no-strike rule. </p> <p>\"Never the same again,\" said Nursing Times at the time. But it has, in fact, since been very much the same. The college has not taken any industrial action and there is no prospect of it doing so. Yet the scrapping of the no-strike rule was a stunning propaganda coup that had reverberations across the political landscape. </p> <p>Hancock's use of that issue was much in the mould of her predecessor, Trevor Clay, who transformed what was the original twin-set-and-pearls organisation into the very model of new trade unionism. She came from an NHS management background, though she had of course been a nurse, and had to reign in some of the college's wilder entrepreneurial activity that an ailing Clay had let flourish. </p> <p>The college has, however, always been highly centralised. And this is causing dissent over the running of the current ballots. Mike Hayward, a prominent RCN steward from Portsmouth, wrote in last week's Nursing Times that he had received nine \"biased and misleading\" pieces of propaganda on the membership and subscription votes, including a postcard that has gone from Hancock to each member. Describing this as a \"scandalous abuse of power\", Hayward called for a new general secretary who would \"run democratic, open and well-informed ballots\". </p> <p>If the speculation is right, he may be getting a new general secretary soon. The college is playing down talk of Hancock going, but the international role she will formally get next June is not seen as compatible with leading the RCN. No obvious successor stands waiting, but there would be no shortage of candidates for the \u00a390,000-plus a year job. </p> <p>Hancock has always been coy about her age, but one profile five years ago put her then at 52. Nurses of her generation have the right to retire with full benefits at 55. All things considered, the timing would seem to be right.</p>",
  "Libya's oil minister yesterday warned that Opec would be forced to cut its oil output if the price of petroleum dropped as a result of a US move to release emergency supplies. <p>As ministers arrived in Caracas for the first Opec summit in 25 years, the Libyan oil minister, Abdullah el-Badri, said: \"I hope this decision [by the US] doesn't shrink the price too much and we are forced to cut production.\" </p> <p>Algeria's energy and mining minister, Chakib Khelil, also warned: \"There is a good chance we will have to [cut output]. There will be declining demand in the second quarter of 2001 and with stocks rising there won't be strong demand for Opec crude.\" </p> <p>Opec - which controls two-thirds of world crude exports - has achieved a new relevance amid the greatest oil boom since the 1980s and protests throughout Europe at pump prices. </p> <p>Although Ali Rodriguez, Venezuela's oil minister and Opec president, believes that prices will stabilise at a \"fair\" $25 a barrel, the cartel does not agree with the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries, which favour increased production as a solution to consumer pressure, instead of a cut in petrol taxes. </p> <p>Opec's new-found confidence is a dramatic turnaround from two years ago, when oil prices sank to $10 a barrel and the cartel was mired in bickering over quota busting. Now - thanks in part to Venezuela's ebullient leader, Hugo Chavez - Opec is returning to the influence it wielded in the 1970s and 80s. </p> <p>Mr Chavez has worked tirelessly to remodel the cartel into a consumer-friendly advocacy group. In August he toured all the Opec countries. </p> <p>On Monday night, Mr Chavez gave a televised address to the country, full of his typical revolutionary rhetoric, saying that the industrialised world had grown rich on the cheap oil from producing countries. </p> <p>\"This reunion isn't only about oil,\" he said, referring to the two-day summit which begins today. Opec would also focus on global poverty, foreign debts and unfair terms of trade for developing countries in their search \"for a more just world\", he said. </p> <p>Industrialised countries which were flush with cheap oil a few years ago are now demanding that Opec acts to stabilise a gyrating market that has seen oil prices reach 10-year highs and prompted protests in Europe. </p> <p>Opec's secretary general, Ril wanu Lukman of Nigeria, said cartel members were surprised by the industrialised countries' refusal in Prague to cut oil taxes. Opec views such taxes - along with free market speculators and hindrances in refining - as the real cause of high prices. </p> <p>Since his election in 1998, Mr Chavez has seized the stage at opportune moments to cajole fellow leaders of developing countries to unite and confront the perils of globalisation. When oil prices fell in 1998, Venezuela plunged into a devastating recession it is still struggling to escape from. Unemployment is officially 15%, while some 80% of its 23m people live in poverty. </p> <p>Mr Chavez said on Monday that his government was following in the footsteps of the late Juan Pablo Perez Alfonzo, a Venezuelan energy minister who was a founding father of Opec in 1960 and helped break the stranglehold of foreign oil companies on oil-producing countries. </p> <p>\"And now, Opec has arisen again,\" Mr Chavez said.</p>",
  "President Slobodan Milosevic's government officially announced last night that there would be a second round contest in the battle for the Yugoslav presidency - even though all polls indicated that he has been defeated and does not qualify for a second attempt to win power. <p>In a brief press conference, the federal electoral commission, which is packed with political appointees of the president, announced that the opposition candidate Vojislav Kostunica won 48.22% of the vote in Sunday's ballot to 40.23 for Mr Milosevic. </p> <p>\"In short, in the presidential elections there will be a second round,\" an official told Serbian television. The second round run-off is scheduled for Sunday, October 8. </p> <p>But Mr Kostunica last night said he would not take part in the run-off, insisting he won the election outright. </p> <p>\"We are talking about political fraud and blatant stealing of votes,\" Mr Kostunica said in a statement. \"This is an offer which must be rejected.\" </p> <p>The commission's announcement confirmed the worst fears of the 19 opposition parties who are united behind Mr Kostunica, a 56-year-old law professor. According to almost all the polls, he won the presidential race by around 20 percentage points. </p> <p>The opposition called an immediate press conference to condemn the latest move by Mr Milosevic to hold on to power. There is growing concern that in the 12 days before the second round Mr Milosevic will use a reserve force of paramilitary police to suppress the growing numbers of demonstrators coming on to the streets. </p> <p>The danger is that, with the opposition's announcement that they will not contest the run-off, Mr Milosevic will claim victory by default. </p> <p>Reacting to the commission's announcement, opposition leader Zoran Djindjic said: \"We are dealing with a big fraud and falsifying of results. We were aware of their intentions because it was obvious they were cooking up something to get Mr Milosevic in the second round at least. But we have firm evidence in our hands and we will defend the will of the people till the end.\" </p> <p>Earlier Mr Djindjic had said: \"Kostunica won in the first round and the elections are over for us. There will be no second round.\" </p> <p>The Democratic Opposition of Serbia earlier released its own tally based on what it said was 97.5% of the ballots. It showed Mr Kostunica leading with 55% to Mr Milosevic's 35%. The figures are said to be based on reports by the opposition's poll watchers who monitor the local counts. </p> <p>Dagor Hiber, an opposition spokesman and vice president of the Civic Alliance, said it was unlikely Mr Kostunica would accept a second ballot: \"We will look at all these results and decide, but I think that our decision will be that there will not be a second round. \"We have all the electoral materials from 97% of voting places. I think the government are buying time,\" he said. </p> <p>Dragisa Burzan, a deputy prime minister in Montenegro, the small republic that along with Serbia forms Yugoslavia, said: \"Milosevic is consistent in claiming victory and it might mean he's not just going to walk away.\" </p> <p>During the day, the United States pledged to lead an international campaign to pressure Mr Milosevic into accepting the outcome. Washington joined European powers in calling for Mr Milosevic to accept an apparent opposition victory and step down from the power after 13 years. </p> <p>President Bill Clinton said that it was clear the opposition party had defeated Mr Milosevic and that if the will of the Serbian people was respected, the US would lift economic sanctions against the nation. </p> <p>\"Despite the government's attempts to manipulate the vote, it does seem clear that the people have voted for change,\" Mr Clinton said. \"The question is will the government listen in response?\" </p> <p>In Brighton, Tony Blair told the Labour party conference that it was time for Mr Milosevic to leave. \"I say to Milosevic: 'You lost. Go. Your country and the world has suffered enough'.\"</p>",
  "The Kremlin was quietly preparing yesterday to bid good riddance to Slobodan Milosevic after 10 years of watching the Serbian strongman exploit notions of Slav and Orthodox brotherhood to drive wedges between Moscow and the west. <p>While guarded and even-handed in its reaction to the potentially seismic shift in the Balkans, Moscow made clear it would not be disappointed by a new president in Belgrade, such as the opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica, and also criticised Mr Milosevic's organisation of the poll. </p> <p>The Yugoslav president's mounting woes and within the ranks of his tightly controlled political apparatus were compounded by the fact that his most important, if ambivalent, international ally was walking away, apparently no longer seeing the Yugoslav state and the Milosevic regime as synonymous. </p> <p>The Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, criticised Mr Milosevic for not allowing election monitors from the European Union, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and other western organisations to keep an eye on Sunday's ballot. </p> <p>The thrust of official Russian comment yesterday and on Monday had been to praise the Yugoslav electorate and the high turnout, a factor which benefited Mr Kostunica over the incumbent. </p> <p>In Moscow on Monday, the German chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, emerged from talks with President Vladimir Putin to state that both men were heartened by the strengthening of democracy in Yugoslavia. While Mr Putin stayed silent, the Kremlin did not contradict the chancellor. </p> <p>A Russian foreign ministry statement yesterday implicitly warned Mr Milosevic against resorting to violence to stay in power. </p> <p>With 50 observers, Russia had the largest team monitoring Sunday's poll, making it better informed than most outsiders about the election results. Informed Russian comment predicted that there would be a second round to the Milosevic-Kostunica duel.</p>",
  "If the procession of visitors to the former residence of the king of Yugoslavia - now the home of President Slobodan Milosevic and his powerful wife, Mira Markovic - means anything, it paints a bleak picture of what is in store for the people of Serbia. <p>The couple have been at Beli Dvor, or White Court, since casting their votes in the elections on Sunday morning. </p> <p>According to reliable sources, the guests since then have included Zoran Janackovic, a former secret police chief and now ambassador to Macedonia, followed by the current head of the Serbian police, Vlajko Stojiljkovic, and the head of state security, Rado Markovic. Yesterday afternoon they had a visit from General Nebojsa Pavkovic, who runs the army. </p> <p>President Milosevic has enjoyed 13 years at the top after coming to power in September 1987. </p> <p>But now his people have rejected him in favour of a 56-year-old lawyer, Vojislav Kostunica, who has united Serbia against Mr Milosevic and his wife. And the signs of what is to come are ominous. </p> <p>\"Initially they were in complete shock when the results came through and he especially was stunned by them. They never expected the opposition to get their act together so quickly,\" said the former information ministry head, Aleksandar Tijanic. </p> <p>\"He doesn't watch TV and his party people told him he was assured of victory. At first they could not believe it,\" he added. </p> <p>\"They were convinced that they were going to win. For the first 24 hours there was a real battle between Milosevic and his wife to choose between the soft option of letting go of power and the hard one that could eventually mean police on the streets.\" </p> <p>Their strategy was decided after a three-hour meeting in the White Court on Tuesday morning with the leaders of both their parties, said Nebojsa Covic, the former leader of the Belgrade Socialist party and the ex-mayor of Belgrade. Ms Markovic leads the Yugoslav United Left party. </p> <p>\"The meeting began at 9am at their residence and ended at 12. After that they announced his victory at a press conference and said there would be another round.\" </p> <p>\"They are preparing to go for another round,\" said Mr Covic. \"Some of his people told him that he should recognise the elections but the problem is his ego and his wife. They are both very sick people now.\" </p> <p>\"She sees herself a some sort of Rosa Luxemburg, or Karl Marx, with a mission to save Serbian communism at whatever price,\" Slavoljub Djukic, the author of four books on Slobodan Milosevic and Mira Markovic said. </p> <p>\"In a way he is the softer one. The one thing that Milosevic treasures above all else - even power - is his family and if they were under threat as they are now, I think he would consider other options. There are countries that could take them - China - but it will be she that decides.\" </p> <p>Mr Covic, who also agreed that it would be Ms Markovic, not Mr Milosevic, who decides Serbia's fate, said he believed that they were buying time to discredit the elections before crushing the protests. </p> <p>\"It is true that the paramilitaries and parapolice are available to them. It is a sort of criminal police force that in cludes: the Legion, which has around 500 men; Frenki's Boys, about 1,400 of them [a vicious paramilitary force that fought in Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo] and finally about 1,600 men in the 7th brigade who are loyal to him and based in Montenegro.\" </p> <p>The presidential couple have been an extraordinary and devastating political unit for over 40 years since meeting at school. </p> <p>\"She chose him and she made him president,\" said Mr Covic, who for four years was part of the inner circle. \"I was in the house regularly, for dinner, for talks. While I was mayor of Belgrade three years ago I was there every day.\" </p> <p>Mr Covic believes that now, as then, Ms Markovic is insistent that her husband does not accept the election results. </p> <p>\"She is mad. It is as simple as that and she is very powerful,\" he said. </p> <p>In a reference to demonstrations in Belgrade at the rigging of local elections, Mr Covic added: \"During the protests in 1997 I tried to persuade him that he couldn't just null the elections and he would eventually have to give in. </p> <p>\"Then he would appear to soften and go home and then he would be back the next morning as hardline as ever. She cleaned his mind then and she is doing it again now,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Over the last two years even his speeches reflect her language. He has started using her words. Words for the opposition like 'lesbians', 'hyenas', 'rats'. That is Mira talking and now she is in charge.\" </p> <p>Speaking before the election commission's announcement of the runoff, he added: \"My prediction is that they will have a second round and then find some way to discredit the elections. </p> <p>\"Then they will bring the parapolice on to the streets and it will be a very dangerous time for everyone.\" </p> <p>As if on cue, the phone in the former mayor's office rang. His workers told him that the gov ernment was declaring that the results from 26 out of 70 polling stations in one area of Belgrade would be declared invalid. </p> <p>The reasons given included the stations staying open late, the fact that they had more ballots than they were supposed to have, and the distance of party posters from the entrance to the polling station, which was said to be less than the required 50 metres. </p> <p>\"It's starting,\" he said.</p>",
  "He says it is all untrue. His partner does not believe him. As the couple's friends take sides and third parties are sucked in, each blames the other. Accusations fly; trust is lost; and the relationship begins to crumble. Cohabitation is never easy. It often ends in tears. And after three years in a polite but loveless relationship, French president Jacques Chirac and prime minister Lionel Jospin appear to be no exception. With hindsight, as therapists say, it is plain the two men never had much in common: one a Gaullist, the other a Socialist; one a back-slapping, party-machine patrician, the other a cerebral, rather strait-laced professor. Given that they are likely rivals for the presidency in 2002, it is a wonder their power-sharing double act lasted as long as it did. But now it is rapidly, very publicly falling apart and the outcome could be immensely damaging to both. <p>The catalyst for this rupture was the discovery last week of a videotape personally implicating Mr Chirac in illegal fundraising for his RPR party while mayor of Paris, prior to 1995. Although the president has frequently been accused of knowing about various Paris town hall slush-funds, voter registration fiddles, kickbacks and payroll frauds, and although investigations into the conduct of the current RPR mayor, Jean Tiberi, have long been in train, the tape appeared to provide the first evidence directly linking Mr Chirac to criminal wrongdoing. Since then, like an ink stain on a tablecloth, the scandal has rapidly spread. On Monday, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Mr Jospin's finance minister and close associate until he resigned under a cloud last October, admitted he had possessed a copy of the tape in 1998 but had not handed it over to the police. This immediately sparked speculation that Mr Jospin himself knew more than he was admitting, or that his judgment was sadly awry, or that the Socialists were playing dirty tricks to embarrass the president. Mr Chirac, on the record, dismisses the allegations as lies. Mr Jospin, on the record, says his hands are clean. </p> <p>For democracy's sake if nothing else, it is to be hoped that these rebuttals are entirely and wholly accurate. As so often in the past, it is not the crime itself but the subsequent cover-up that brings disaster. Mr Jospin has already suffered badly in the polls in the wake of the recent fuel protests. His interior minister's defection over his Corsica policy damaged him. Suddenly, despite his tax cuts, economic growth is slowing. Mr Chirac has had his setbacks, too, not least in last Sunday's risible referendum on presidential terms and his leading role in the EU's Austrian debacle. Now the shadows of Mitterrand and Kohl gather around his re-election hopes. Thus at the very moment of their estrangement, this odd couple actually need each other more than ever. And in a very French sort of way, it may be that they will yet succeed in reaching a mutually satisfactory accommodation.</p>",
  "Euphoric but apprehensive, Serbia's opposition parties have planned a victory concert in Belgrade tonight, despite the state election commis sion's call for a runoff in the presidential contest. <p>Vojislav Kostunica, the opposition leader, has already said he will accept nothing less than a first-round victory. </p> <p>With 97% of the votes counted, the Democratic Opposition of Serbia said yesterday that by its unofficial tally Mr Kostunica had 54.6% and Slobodan Milosevic 35%. </p> <p>This result was supported by both the Belgrade-based Cen tre for Free Elections and Democracy and the far-right Serbian Radical party which ran its own candidate and is still nominally part of President Milosevic's coalition. </p> <p>Cedomir Jovanovic, the opposition spokesman, said: \"It is absolutely certain we have won, and so we request the federal election commission to erase all suspicion and not misuse this critical situation.\" </p> <p>He called on Mr Milosevic's Socialist party of Serbia and the Yugoslav United Left party to respect the popular will and cede power. If this did not happen, he said the opposition would protest peacefully. </p> <p>Meanwhile Miroslav Hristodulo, deputy president of the Social Democratic Union, said before yesterday's runoff announcement that if the election commission denied Mr Kostunica outright victory, nightly demonstrations would take place from tomorrow. </p> <p>Asked about the future of Serbian hardliners who have been indicted by the international criminal tribunal in the Hague, he said Mr Kostunica's plan was retribution rather than revenge. There would be proper law and proper trials, he said. </p> <p>Few observers believed that the opposition would come together so smoothly to give the country's disillusioned voters a respected figure to support. </p> <p>Massive campaigns to mobilise voters were organised by non-governmental groups, women's organisations and the student resistance group Otpor. </p> <p>Another opposition tactic - to provide an efficient and credible vote-reporting service - caught the Milosevic regime off guard. </p> <p>Politika, a pro-government newspaper, published partial local election results yesterday that noted opposition victories in many towns. </p> <p>A Socialist party spokesman, Ivica Dacic, also admitted at a press conference that the government had lost some towns, but declared its overwhelming victory in parliamentary elections. He made no mention of the presidential poll. Some saw this as a sign that the government would eventually back down. </p> <p>\"If they have already recognised such a crushing defeat in all the municipalities, there is no chance for them to tamper with other results now,\" said Mladjan Dinkic, coordinator of the G-17 Plus group of academics and professionals. </p> <p>In another sign of the opposition leader's acceptance within the country, the head of the Serbian Orthodox church, Patriarch Pavle, received Mr Kostunica yesterday.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown underlined his determination to resist calls for vote-winning concessions on fuel and pensions yesterday when he ruled out a pre-election upgrade in the economy's annual growth rate - a move which would add billions of pounds to his budget surplus. </p> <p>Laying out his goal of beefing up Britain's growth rate over the next four years as part of a nationwide drive to increase productivity, Mr Brown said that - although the economy had consistently outperformed pessimistic Treasury assumptions - it was too soon to plan spending on a more generous trend growth rate. </p> <p>\"We will not fall into the trap of basing our approach to economic policy including fiscal policy on the potential for improvement in trend growth before this has been demonstrably achieved,\" Mr Brown told delegates at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund annual meetings in Prague. </p> <p>\"So we will continue over the coming year with the same deliberately prudent approach to the public finances.\" </p> <p>There had been speculation that, with an election likely next year, Mr Brown would increase the estimate of the sustainable growth rate for planning the public finances to 2.5%, the growth rate the Treasury considers to be consistent with non-inflationary long term growth. </p> <p>But, in a reference to the \"boom and bust\" of the late 1980s which led to the largest ever peace time deficit, Mr Brown declared: \"We will not make the old British mistake of assuming that a cyclical improvement in the public fi nances automatically means a structural improvement.\" </p> <p>Shortly after the general election, Labour cut the estimate of the trend rate of growth from the 2.5% figure which the Conservatives used to plan public finances to 2.25%. </p> <p>The Treasury's goal is to raise the sustainable growth rate to 2.75% over the next four years, an objective which Mr Brown said was achievable. </p> <p>The Chancellor said Britain had much to learn from the American economy, which has enjoyed high growth, low inflation and rising productivity for most of the 1990s. </p> <p>\"It [the US] has shown how combining stability and fiscal prudence with high levels of investment, particularly in the new information technologies, can lead to sustained productivity improvements and more higher skilled employment. </p> <p>\"Our challenge is through a national productivity drive to bridge the 30% gap with our competitors which still exists.\" </p> <p>An upward revision to the trend growth assumption would have the effect of swelling Treasury coffers because it would allow a lower forecast for unemployment and welfare spending and a higher forecast for tax receipts. Experts at the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimate that raising the assumption of the trend rate of growth would give the chancellor an extra \u00a31.4bn to play with in next year's Budget and \u00a32.8bn the following year. </p> <p>But in reality the public coffers are awash with cash and the government has already pencilled in big rises in spending on health, education and transport in coming years so has no need to pull any book-keeping stunt to give itself any more money.</p>"
