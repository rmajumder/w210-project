  "<p> There could not possibly be a more terrible film on release now than Rules of Engagement, the big new action movie from no less a director than William Friedkin. This shrill, belligerent, reactionary nonsense is lazily plotted, grotesquely dishonest, and dripping with a creepy strain of Islamophobia. The film is about one of Uncle Sam's uniformed heroes accused of bending the rules in the heat of battle and - but of course - let down by the pointy-headed PC politicos in Washington. Samuel L Jackson plays Colonel Terry Childers, a Marine Corps veteran who leads a mission to rescue the US ambassador from the Yemen embassy. The ambassador is a nervous, cowardly, duplicitous liar, and therefore played by a British actor, Ben Kingsley. When a local anti-American demo turns ugly a catastrophe ensues. </p> <p>Shot at from somewhere outside the embassy compound, Childers orders his men to fire into the crowd - having to repeat his order to a terrified subordinate who can see no justification for this - and causes scores of civilian deaths. </p> <p>The consequent political row leads to a court-martial, and Childers asks to be defended by his old buddy Colonel Hodges (Tommy Lee Jones), a desk-bound army lawyer whose life he saved in Vietnam 30 years before. Hays is a mediocre lawyer and semi-reformed drinker liable to fall off the wagon at any time. But never mind that: he's a Marine, and he knows what it's like to risk death under fire, and so only he has the kind of moral \u00dcbermensch status necessary to tackle this crisis. He's the only guy Terry can trust . </p> <p>In Humphrey Bogart's immortal phrase, it stinks up the screen. Jackson and Jones are less than convincing as soldiers of any sort, and by seeking to endow the Marines with both triumphal glamour and victim status, the film strikes more false notes than a platoon of pissed Banffshire pipers. Rules of Engagement turns on the very simple issue of whether there were armed terrorists concealed in the apparently unarmed demo crowd. If there were, Childers would obviously have some justification for his action. But through a tiresome sleight of hand, this information is withheld from us until the very end, thus maintaining a bogus narrative and moral tension. </p> <p>There is, we learn, a videotape recovered from one of the embassy's CCTV cameras, which could exonerate Terry. A sinister national security aide conceals it - naturally setting up our expectation of its eventual discovery at the 11th hour. But later, the evil aide burns it. Oh no! Our hero's only material evidence up in smoke! Will a copy be found? Er, no. Hays mutters some thing at the trial about a missing video but finally manages to persuade the khaki-clad jury to acquit his man with nothing more concrete than a heart-rending, choked-up speech about how as army folk they should not leave a Marine \"out to dry\". Over the closing credits, almost as an afterthought, we are perfunctorily informed that the corrupt video-hiding-and-burning aide has been busted. </p> <p>So the video muddle shows Stephen Gaghan's screenplay needed a few rewrites. But that is not the real insult to the intelligence. To garner evidence for the defence, Colonel Hodges goes out to Yemen and sees for himself the terrible civilian casualties, including a heartbreaking little girl with one leg, hobbling around on a crutch. This is the cue for one of the shortest dark nights of the soul on record. Hays gets drunk on the plane back and gets involved in a fist-fight with Jackson - which is quickly resolved by the two of them guffawing and slapping each other on the back. The issue of civilian casualties is just the pretext for some male bonding. </p> <p>The full queasy significance of this sugary pseudo-resolution does not, however, emerge until William Friedkin finally favours us with what Jackson actually saw before he opened fire: a lot of sinister dusky Ay-rabs with guns, hiding among the women and children in the demo - and the heartbreaking little girl was actually toting a weapon herself! You can't trust these towel-heads when they whinge about civilian deaths, you see... The sheer effrontery of that moment made me gasp. But it was nothing to what Friedkin produces at the finish: a North Vietnamese combat veteran wheeled out as a prosecution witness to testify to the nature of Terry's brutality to unarmed PoWs in 'Nam. Miraculously shedding his semi-drunken incompetence, Hays forces him in cross-examination to admit that he would do the same thing himself. And on the courtroom steps, over a rich violin swell, the greying Vietcong guy actually salutes the victorious Terry. </p> <p>It was at this moment that I moaned from the stalls: \"Oh for Christ's sake !\" We're used to self-pitying tough guys in uniform shouting at us that we can't handle the truth. But Rob Reiner's A Few Good Men at least had good performances and a sharp script. And David O Russell's Three Kings showed us that it is possible to make a modern war movie which is politically savvy, yet sympathetic to the choices faced by soldiers in battle. </p> <p>But all Friedkin serves up is a naive macho romp - with a little contemporary twist. As the bullets fly in Yemen, we see a photo on the wall of the ambassador's office of Bill Clinton, and another of Al Gore. In a later scene, the Clinton photo has for some reason disappeared. But Gore is still there - this year's little-fancied Democratic hopeful, presiding over this political betrayal of America's fighting man. Is Rules of Engagement the kind of Hollywood war film we can expect to see from now on? Compassionate nouveau Rambo for the George Bush Jr generation?</p>",
  "Al Gore and George W Bush were out on the stump talking up their respective running mates in the presidential campaign. <p>Gore's prospective vice-president, Joe Lieberman was lauding the redemptive powers of miracles; and Bush's, Dick Cheney, was meeting a Christian organisation. Elsewhere in the United States, Hillary Clinton was helping to hand out Congressional medals to 15 well-deserving cases such as Jesse Jackson, allegedly dangerous car tyres were being recalled, and Elizabeth Taylor was being treated for mild pneumonia. </p> <p>And far away in Huntsville, Texas, early today, a 33-year-old man with the mind of a child of 12 was receiving a lethal injection. Oliver Cruz, who had spent 12 years on death row, said he was sorry for raping and killing a 24-year-old woman and blamed drink and drugs rather than his IQ, which had been tested as low as 63, making him mentally retarded. </p> <p>\"I want to apologise to the family of Kelly Donovan (his victim),\" said the killer who could barely read or write, speaking from the death chamber. \"I'm sorry for what I did to her. I wish they could forgive me for what I did.\" </p> <p>The Huntsville death chamber is the busiest in the United States and has had 227 clients since capital punishment returned to Texas in 1982, 140 of them in the five years since Mr Bush became governor. </p> <p>Thirteen of the 38 states where the death penalty can be imposed do not execute the mentally retarded. Mr Bush's brother Jeb, governor of Florida, will not sign death warrants on such people and an attempt to save the mentally retarded from lethal injections in Texas failed last year in the state legislature. </p> <p>The measure is thought likely to have more chance of passing next year when it comes up again for consideration. \"That's the tragedy of this case,\" said Jeff Pokorak, Cruz's lawyer. The law is going to prevent the execution of people like Cruz in six to eight months so he would be the last retarded person to die under the old law.\" </p> <p>But it would be a mistake to imagine that the streets are teeming with people objecting to this ghoulish cull. Cruz's case would barely have been noticed, if at all, were it not for his mental state. Certainly, the name of 36-year-old Brian Roberson, who stabbed to death an elderly couple in 1986, would not have rated a mention had he not been executed in the same death chamber an hour before Cruz. </p> <p>True, support for the death penalty has ebbed, down to a 19-year low of 66 per cent at the last count. But the subject was just not an issue at last week's Republican Party convention; no-one expects to hear a word about it when the Democrats have theirs in a few days. </p> <p>Both candidates for president are supporters, as are their running mates. President Clinton famously broke off from the campaign trail in 1992 to return to Arkansas, where he was governor, to sign the death warrant on a mentally-impaired man. </p> <p>And Hillary Clinton, who is running for the Senate from New York, might be the only person running for elected office in the western world who is described by her opponents as an extreme left winger and by herself as a supporter of the death penalty.</p>",
  "A 33-year-old killer with the mental capacity of a child not yet into his teens was executed early today in the state governed by George W Bush, the candidate most likely to be the next president of the United States. <p>Oliver Cruz, who tested as mentally disabled and could barely read or write, was given a lethal injection in the country's busiest death chamber. </p> <p>Cruz, who had been on death row for 12 years for the rape and murder of a 24-year-old woman, had said: \"I made a mistake. I don't blame nobody. I take full responsibility. There's nothing I could do or say to bring the person back. There's nothing I could do or say to her family about how sorry I am.\" </p> <p>Cruz was one half of a double execution in Huntsville, Texas. The second man was Brian Roberson, 36, who stabbed to death an elderly couple in 1986. </p> <p>Smiling from the execution chamber yesterday, he lashed out at family members and police officers who testified against him at his trial. \"You ain't got what you want,\" he said. </p> <p>Before yesterday there had been 225 executions in the state since the death penalty was restored there in 1982; 140 since Mr Bush became governor five years ago. </p> <p>The power to use capital punishment exists in 38 of the 50 US states, but the execution of mentally disabled people is barred in 13 of these. A bill aimed at introducing a ban in Texas was voted down last year. </p> <p>It is thought that the measure has a good chance of success when it comes up for consideration again next year. \"That's the tragedy of this case,\" said Jeff Pokorak, Cruz's lawyer. </p> <p>\"The law is going to prevent the execution of people like Cruz in six to eight months, so he would be the last retarded person to die under the old law.\" </p> <p>The supreme court voted 6-3 to reject Cruz's request for a reprieve and an appeal. The Texas board of pardons and parole had earlier denied Cruz clemency by a margin of 18-0. </p> <p>Mr Bush had the right to grant Cruz a 30-day reprieve but, as he was out of the state, the responsibility passed to Rick Perry, the lieutenant-governor of Texas. </p> <p>Cruz, who blamed his crime on alcohol and the drugs he had been abusing since the age of 13, had received support from the American Bar Association, the European Union and government officials in Sweden and France. </p> <p>But his case failed to stimulate the interest in Texas that accompanied the execution two months ago of Gary Graham, who claimed until the end that he was innocent. Hundreds of campaigners protested against his execution outside the Huntsville jail. </p> <p>The Cruz case is unlikely to make even the slightest impact on the presidential election campaign, despite any irony implicit in Mr Bush's championing of \"compassionate conservatism.\"</p> <p>Sixty-six per cent of Americans support the death penalty - including Mr Bush, his opponent Al Gore and both their running mates.</p>",
  "A senior member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has been suspended for making anti-semitic remarks in the wake of Al Gore's choice of Joseph Lieberman as his presidential running-mate. The remarks were condemned by the leadership of the NAACP as \"anti-American\" and the suspension was swift. <p>The head of the Dallas branch of the oldest and most influential black organisation in the country, Lee Alcorn, told a Dallas radio station, KHVN: \"If we get a Jew person then what I'm wondering is... what is this movement for? Does it have anything to do with the failed peace talks?\" </p> <p>Mr Alcorn continued: \"We need to be very suspicious of any kind of partnership between the Jews at that kind of level because we know that their interest primarily has to do with money and these kind of things.\" </p> <p>Kweisi Mfume, the national head of the NAACP, responded immediately by faxing Mr Alcorn a suspension order which will be in effect until an inquiry has been carried out. Mr Mfume said later that Mr Alcorn did not speak for either the NAACP board or any of its membership and his remarks had been both \"anti-semitic and anti-American\". </p> <p>As the row grew, Mr Alcorn claimed that his remarks had been taken out of context and that he was not anti-semitic but only anti-Lieberman. \"I don't see where he has been a champion for African-American concerns,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Alcorn's remarks were in contrast to those of the outspoken Rev Al Sharpton who told the political television show Hardball on Tuesday night that the appointment of Mr Lieberman was to be welcomed as a positive step. </p> <p>There has been a rash of anti-semitic messages posted on the internet in the wake of Mr Lieberman's appointment and America Online has taken action to close down a number of sites. </p> <p>As the news of the suspension emerged, Mr Gore and Mr Lieberman were heading for Atlanta, where they will pay a joint tribute to the work of Martin Luther King, a move which was seen as a sign to the African-American community. </p>",
  "What is it about William \"14-pints-a-day\" Hague's image that causes him so much trouble? Apart from the premature baldness, now resolved by his adoption of a menacing Grant Mitchell crop, his CV should be a spin doctor's dream. A \"normal\" middle-class family background, north of Watford too, a state school education, four As at A-level and straight into Oxford. There he both got a first and was president of the Union, a rare double. Thence into McKinsey's, the cult management consultancy which does not hire fools. <p>Onwards and upwards until, at 36, already an ex-cabinet minister, young William becomes the youngest Tory leader since Pitt (who got the job in 1793 when he was 24). He was a William too, come to think of it, nerdy and a bit of a boozer. As Cecil Parkinson used to say: \"At every stage William's done better than Tony Blair.\" And yet he still seems to get the personal stuff horribly wrong. Even making allowances for the August silly season in Fleet Street, yesterday's tabloids were, surely, a nightmare. </p> <p>\"I was Britain's biggest boozer,\" thundered the Mirror. \"Billy Liar,\" roared the Sun with its usual delicacy. The broadsheets were scarcely kinder. Even the FT managed \"Billy Fizz Hague tries to sink his sober image\" on page three, so that Britain's EU partners, just recovering from Euro 2000's battle of Charleroi, will be sure to see it. </p> <p>In one casual exchange with GQ magazine, Mr Hague had simultaneously annoyed a vast coalition of voters: health fascists joined forces with teetotallers, prigs with sophisticated teenies who know that simply everybody nowadays does drugs (that's why it's called e-commerce) on Saturday nights. All of them combined with anyone who wants to feminise the tone of our still rather masculine public life to denounce him for laddishness, social irresponsibility and a sheer lack of cool. It could be argued that the worst offence was caused to boozers of the old school, who simply didn't believe the claim. At 15 or 55 years old, it's a lot of beer. In Rotherham they claimed to remember that the lad who helped deliver the beer barrels on behalf of his dad's company, wasn't even a half-of-lager lout. </p> <p>Hence the Billy Fizz and Billy Pop jokes. They reinforce what remains the predominant public image of Hague the teenager as a nerd, who made \"that speech\" at the Tory conference in 1977, who read Hansard and kept byelection results, not football results, on his bedroom wall. We have been here before with Mr Hague. Back in 1997, he was photographed in a baseball cap and then drinking through a straw (beer presumably) out of a melon at the Notting Hill carnival. A young, happening-kind-of Tory leader, one who cared, had taken over, was the not-so-subliminal message. </p> <p>Except it didn't work, as Tory strategists came to realise. It wasn't the real Hague and it wasn't the right message after the slaughter of May 1. Hague was already busy remoulding his party well out of public gaze. Once he'd done that and finished apologising for past Tory error, he could start to move on policy reformation. </p> <p>The Hague Mk II who emerged in time for the 1999 European elections (along with the Grant Mitchell look) was harder and meaner. He focused on Tory core issues with wider resonance: the euro, law and order, asylum seekers entering Britain during the Kosovo war, enough to start getting Tony Blair rattled. No more Mr Nice Guy, and some cartoonists started to portray him in an uglier light than the short-trousered kid at Margaret Thatcher's side. Lately he has begun making speeches on education and health - he may tackle green issues soon - but Hague Mk II has been the key to the modest revival of Tory electoral fortunes. It is the Hague who will fight the coming election. </p> <p>What happened on the pages of GQ this week was not another attempt to reposition the leader's image, it was an accident. The interview was given weeks ago on the grounds, familiar enough to Mr Blair's handlers, that GQ is an upmarket lads' mag, the market leader in fact, which reaches thirty-something voters with lots of disposable cash who are too busy playing squash or shopping to read much. </p> <p> The interviewer was not just another hack either. Nicholas Coleridge is a media grandee, MD of the Cond\u00e9 Nast group which owns GQ, the Eton-and-Trinity son of a past chairman of Lloyds. It is a patsy interview; Mr Coleridge has decided Mr Hague is now the plucky underdog, but there is a distinct tone of condecension in the exchanges. This being GQ, there was a lot of detail about where Hague buys his suits (posh West End) and what colour shirts he likes (blue). His feet are size 9 and Ffion has purged his wide-lapel jackets. She buys him daft cufflinks. </p> <p>Fascinating or what? But politicians have to do this nowadays, though Gordon Brown's GQ interview on fashion would be rather short. The Tory leader was given space for a brief message: GQ should vote Tory for a better business climate, national sovereignty and improved public services. </p> <p>GQ played it up (hey, this is August), but the beer story is actually old. Hague has written it himself, as in the Times of November 15 1997: \"When I'd finished each delivery I'd always be given a pint of John Smith's as a reward. . . at five in the evening I'd be feeling pretty light-headed.\" </p> <p>Far more revealing for a modern populist was his inability to name the England football captain. Describing how he first moved in on Ffion Jenkins (one of his civil servants at the time) he also said that after an official dinner \"we went out socially to a bar in London\" - Hague-speak for \"had a drink\". </p> <p>Yet Mr Hague is a clever man, a witty and fluent public speaker who will, I suspect, surprise us all by surviving long enough to become prime minister over Michael Portillo's acquiescent body - one day. Little horrid has been said about Hague that was not said about Ted Heath or - the dumbos - Mrs T. </p> <p>Last night his aides were putting a brave face on the affair. It had helped to shift that stubbornly-held image voters have of him, as a southern public school boy and toff, they explained. A poll on Talk Radio showed 82% of callers more likely to vote for the 14-pint man than less. Sky TV's poll was running neck and neck. Just as adultery is no bar to high office in France, youthful boozing is not an impediment here. </p> <p>All this may be wishful thinking, but the Tories are surely right to argue that when a wimpish media stereotype clashes with a claim to be a 14-pint man it will produce a bang. All politicians reinvent themselves a bit to become more interesting and all, including Tony Blair, get caught out. </p> <p>The sad thing is that in an age of professionalised politics, when they all start so young, few have time to do or become anything interesting before they start polishing those leadership CVs. </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:michael.white@theguardian.com\"> michael.white@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "The arrests of eight foreigners, including two Britons, on charges of espionage are designed to create a \"sense of siege\" and boost President Slobodan Milosevic's already strong chances in next month's elections, western officials fear. <p>\"They are in effect hostages to his effort to present Yugoslavia as being under threat,\" a senior official said yesterday. </p> <p>Ever since last year's war over Kosovo, western governments have pinned their hopes of removing Mr Milosevic on various scenarios, including an army coup and street demonstrations. When the Yugoslav strongman unexpectedly announced snap elections for next month, they banked on the central campaign issues being the future of the Serbian economy, Serbia's reintegration into the European fold, and how best to achieve political liberalisation. </p> <p>But Mr Milosevic is casting the election as a loyalty test, with his challengers portrayed as traitors. \"This is a battle for the survival of the nation and the state. Slobodan Milosevic is the symbol of Yugoslavia, of heroic resistance to the aggressor, and of restoration and development. Our opponents are not an opposition to our party, but to their own people and the state,\" Gorica Gajevic, the secretary general of the Socialist party of Serbia said last week. </p> <p>Forced on to the back foot, the fractious Serbian opposition has accepted Mr Milosevic's gameplan and, in choosing Vojislav Kostunica as its standard-bearer in the elections, has appointed a nationalist rather than a liberaliser. As a result, western governments find themselves rooting for a man who strongly criticised Nato's Kosovo campaign and who refuses to meet officials from Nato countries. </p> <p>Anti-western feeling is still high in Serbia and although many voters criticise Mr Milosevic they seem to accept his argument that Yugoslavia remains under siege. </p> <p>Mr Milosevic's maverick ally, the ultra-nationalist Vojislav Seselj, yesterday pursued that line. He attacked Mr Kostunica as \"Nato's candidate\". </p> <p>\"Voice of America, Free Europe, Deutsche Welle and the BBC have all praised Kostunica over the past few days in Serbian language broadcasts,\" he said. Mr Kostunica had been more cunning than other opposition leaders at hiding his pro-Nato feelings but Serbs would never vote for \"Nato candidates\", he went on. </p> <p>The charge is ironic since Mr Kostunica's nationalist credentials are clear. Before the Nato air strikes, he was photographed with Serbs in Kosovo brandishing a Kalashnikov rifle in resistance. He has described relations between foreigners and the Serbian state as \"a game in which everything is given up in return for almost nothing, except symbolic concessions\". He strongly opposes the Hague Tribunal and criticises the war crimes indictment issued against Mr Milosevic. </p> <p>This line of \"moderate nationalism\" may explain why Mr Kostunica came out well in a recent poll by the Belgrade-based Institute of Social Sciences. It found him leading Mr Milosevic by 42% to 28%. </p> <p>But the poll was taken before the Serbian Renewal Movement, a leading opposition party, decided to put up its own candidate in a move which will split the anti-Milosevic front.</p>",
  "The Venezuelan president, Hugo Chavez, is due to arrive in Baghdad today, defying western objections and delivering a propaganda coup for the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein. <p>Mr Chavez will be the first elected head of state to meet Mr Saddam since the 1991 Gulf war. Iraq yesterday hailed the visit as a slap in the face for the United States. </p> <p>\"Every now and then, the rulers of America receive slaps from representatives of other countries,\" an Iraqi foreign ministry spokesman said. </p> <p>Venezuela says the visit is justified because it holds the rotating presidency of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec), of which Iraq is a member. </p> <p>On Monday, the US state department said it was \"deeply concerned\" about the planned meeting with President Saddam, but Venezuela insisted that the president would not change his plan. \"Nobody can influence our decision. He's going to arrive, whether it be on a skateboard or on a camel,\" Jose Vicente Rangel, the foreign minister, said. </p> <p>Mr Chavez is expected to travel by land from Iran to avoid the UN-imposed air embargo. But the Americans accuse him of breaking political sanctions, and say that he did not seek advice from the UN sanctions committee before deciding on the visit. </p> <p>In Britain, Ann Clwyd MP, the chairwoman of Indict, the organisation which is seeking to prosecute leading members of the Iraqi regime, described the trip as a bad move. </p> <p>\"I would remind democratically elected presidents of the Iraqi regime's record - it is one of the worst since the second world war,\" she said. \"People forget and start treating [Iraq's leaders] like ordinary human beings. That's why it's important that the UN does set up a war-crimes tribunal and stops dragging its feet.\" </p> <p>Iraq was preparing a ceremonial welcome yesterday for the man it described as \"a dear guest\", and was laying on special facilities for the foreign media to maximise the west's embarrassment. </p> <p>Mr Chavez is touring Opec countries handing out invitations to Caracas next month for what he hopes will be the organisation's first heads-of-state summit for 25 years. He has already visited Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar. </p> <p>Under American pressure, the Saudis have been seeking to increase Opec oil-production quotas, to reduce prices from their peak of around $30 (\u00a320) a barrel. But Venezuela - which at 3.1m barrels a day is Latin America's largest producer - is almost totally dependent on oil revenue, and each $1 drop in oil prices costs it about $1bn (\u00a3665m) a year. </p> <p>Mr Chavez argues that the real issue is not high prices, but fair prices. </p> <p>\"We understand that they [consumers] start to feel uneasy when crude oil prices reach $30 a barrel, but they can imagine how it must have been for us when it fell to $8,\" he said recently. </p> <p>Last month, in a presidential election which the US described as free and fair, Mr Chavez was re-elected with around 60% of the vote. He is a charismatic, populist leader who, despite high oil prices, has failed to deliver economically. </p> <p>During the election, he promised an \"economic revolution\" to get the economy back on its feet and give the poor - his main source of support - a larger share in oil-generated profits. </p> <p><b> Hugo Chavez</b><br> </p> <p> Age 46 </p> <p>President since 1998 </p> <p>Former paratrooper colonel who led a failed coup attempt in1992.

  "Almost as troubling as the bomb which ripped through a pedestrian subway under Pushkin Square in Moscow during Tuesday's rush hour is the question of how President Vladimir Putin may respond. The atrocity, all the more appalling for the absence of any warning, was immediately, perhaps too immediately, blamed on the Chechens. <p>Almost exactly a year ago, a similar outrage in Red Square marked the beginning of a series of bomb attacks, mostly on apartment buildings, in which hundreds died. Mr Putin, only recently appointed prime minister by the then president Boris Yeltsin, used the ensuing revulsion to justify his launching of an all-out war of conquest in Chechnya. After uncounted deaths and immeasurable misery, Mr Putin declared victory and rode his conqueror's chariot to the Kremlin on the back of a presidential election landslide. </p> <p>But as forensic teams pick their way through the Pushkin Square d\u00e9bris, two points should be kept in mind. Despite strenuous efforts by Mr Putin's FSB security apparatus, Chechen responsibility for last year's terror campaign was never conclusively proved and, then as now, the Chechen leadership denied all involvement. And the Chechen \"victory\" that Mr Putin so skilfully exploited for electoral advantage was never entirely real. That conflict continues to this day. If the Chechens were behind Tuesday's blast, and especially if, as is feared, it marks the opening shot in a new urban terror campaign, the lie of Mr Putin's invincibility is exposed before the Russian people. If somebody else was responsible, he may feel even more threatened. </p> <p>Mr Putin has made a lot of enemies since taking office one year ago this week, any one of whom might wish to ruin his anniversary. They include, for example, nationalist elements within the federation (as in Tatarstan) and those in mainly Muslim former Soviet republics opposed to Mr Putin's central Asia \"Ostpolitik\". As Mr Putin warned yesterday against jumping to conclusions about who planted the bomb, some in Moscow predicted he could plunge into another, broad, swingeing law-and-order crackdown which could serve a wide multitude of purposes. Such a move would ostensibly be justified by a need to avenge the victims of Pushkin Square. But even if it fails to net the culprits, as was the case last year, Mr Putin will doubtless use it to ensure that his own position is further strengthened.</p>",
  "Forty years after the murder of the Congolese independence leader Patrice Lumumba, evidence has emerged in Washington that President Dwight Eisenhower directly ordered the CIA to \"eliminate\" him. <p>The evidence comes in a previously unpublished 1975 interview with the minute-taker at an August 1960 White House meeting of Eisenhower and his national security advisers on the Congo crisis.</p> <p>The minute-taker, Robert Johnson, said in the interview that he vividly recalled the president turning to Allen Dulles, director of the CIA, \"in the full hearing of all those in attendance, and saying something to the effect that Lumumba should be eliminated\".</p> <p>Mr Johnson recalled: \"There was stunned silence for about 15 seconds and the meeting continued.\"</p> <p>Lumumba, the first prime minister of Congo after its independence from Belgium in June 1960, was forced from office as the country's civil war deepened and was captured by rivals. He was killed on January 17 1961, becoming one of the key martyrs of the African independence struggle.</p> <p>No direct quotations were ever recorded at the national security council meetings, and Mr Johnson only revealed the exchanges in 1975, when he was privately interviewed by staff of the Senate intelligence committee's post-Watergate inquiry into US covert action.</p> <p>The committee concluded that the US was not involved in the murder, though it confirmed that the CIA had conspired to kill Lumumba, possibly on Eisenhower's orders. Recent Belgian parliamentary inquiries into the murder implicated Belgium but failed to come up with a direct US link.</p> <p>The transcript of Mr Johnson's interview has only come to light because it was included in material sent to the US national archives in connection with the assassination of President John F Kennedy.</p>"
