  "Mo Mowlam is set to take centre stage at the Labour conference this month, with a platform performance highlighting the war on drugs and a headline appearance at the Tribune rally, the traditional forum for dissent at the conference. <p>She is also to speak at a rally of Charter 88, which campaigns for a \"modern and fair democracy\", where she will insist that the party rank and file should remain vital to modern politics.</p> <p>Ms Mowlam, Cabinet Office minister, saddened Labour members and many non-partisan observers when she announced on Monday that she would stand down at the next general election. It fuelled accusations that Tony Blair had misused her talents.</p> <p>Conference organisers said Ms Mowlam would always have been given a prominent slot at the conference. But in the light of her resignation the backroom staff are likely to rejig the agenda to make sure that she is seen to be given the biggest possible slot.</p> <p>She is also certain to be given an emotional standing ovation. Downing Street will be worried that it could be interpreted as an implicit attack on Mr Blair's treatment of her.</p> <p>Ms Mowlam yesterday countered suggestions that she had been forced out of politics by the Labour \"boys' club\" or by jealousy on the part of the prime minister. She said she was still \"good friends\" with Mr Blair.</p> <p>At her meeting with him on Monday \"what he ended up by saying was that he would miss me\", she said. \"But he said that if I thought I was taking the right decision for me then he would live with it.\"</p> <p>She went on: \"I just want to try something different now. Politics will always be a part of me, and I will continue to work as hard as I always have up to the next election. Parliament will also always be in my soul, but whether it will be in my future I cannot say.\"</p> <p>Ms Mowlam also countered suggestions that she had authorised Julia Langdon's forth- coming biography of her. The book is certain to deal with the rumours surrounding the leading politicians who may have briefed against her.</p> <p>Ms Mowlam conceded that she had read a draft for factual inaccuracies but said she had not commented on the book's opinions.</p> <p>She also sought to play down suggestions that she was at war with Peter Mandelson, who succeeded her as Northern Ireland secretary. She said she still talked to him and implied that he would be on the invitation list for her leaving party.</p> <p>\"I am not bitter or angry with anyone,\" she said. \"This was a personal decision.\"</p> <p>Ms Mowlam, 50, who had \"no idea\" yet what she would do when she left parliament, said serving as Northern Ireland secretary had been her most enjoyable time in politics. </p> <p>She has said she is attracted to the idea of becoming an international peace conciliator.</p> <p>She will get an early chance to practice her hand as an international peacemaker when she attends a conference soon to be held in Madrid on the peace talks in Colombia. President Clinton last week allocated more than $1bn to Colombia to help its government fight drug traffickers and growers.</p> <p>Meanwhile the row over her departure ignited again with comments from veteran Labour stalwart Baroness Castle who said the higher reaches of government were too male dominated. \"I do think that women's representation in government will suffer from Mo's departure and the Cabinet will be the weaker for it,\" she said.</p>",
  "William Hague mapped out the Tories' general election battle plan yesterday when he unveiled the party's \"mini-manifesto\" which combined hardline pledges to distance Britain from the European Union with softer commitments to tackle social divisions. <p>With less than a year to go until the expected date for the general election, the Tory leader dismissed recent polls to declare that his party could return to power once voters embrace his \"commonsense revolution\". </p> <p>Many of the details in the Tories' pre-election manifesto, including plans to end state funding of universities and to detain all asylum seekers, have already been leaked. </p> <p>But Mr Hague outlined a few surprises yesterday, including a plan to give young people the right to invest their state pension money into private schemes and a plan to end the health secretary's day-to-day role in running the NHS. </p> <p> </p> <p> <b> Pensions</b> </p> <p>Young people would be encouraged to save for retirement through a state-funded alternative to the basic state pension. Anyone who opts for the scheme would be given a sum of money each month -equivalent to the amount which would eventually fund their state pension - to place in a private or occupational scheme. </p> <p>The mini-manifesto said: \"We wish young people to build up a funded alternative to the basic pension for the future. No one would be forced to change. The basic state pension would continue to be paid as now, not merely to current pensioners but to people of working age and new entrants who want it in the future.\" </p> <p> <b> Health service</b> </p> <p>The NHS would be transformed by ending direct political control of the health service, ending centrally imposed waiting lists and encouraging greater use of the private sector. Pledging to take \"politicians out of day-to-day management of the NHS\", the document said: \"The secretary of state's role will be to set a strategic framework of health policy, agree funding and guarantee minimum standards of quality.\" </p> <p>Patients would be given a maximum waiting time \"based exclusively on their medical need\". The document added: \"That time will be determined by their consultant and will meet the the individual patient's circumstances, not an arbitrary average. The health authority will be required either itself to treat the patient within that waiting time, or to arrange for the patient to be treated in another health authority or to pay for treatment in the independent sector.\" </p> <p> <b> Economy</b> </p> <p>The document confirmed that Mr Hague has abandoned his guarantee to reduce taxes regardless of the state of the economy. Instead the Tories have pledged to cut taxes if the economic conditions are right. </p> <p>It said: \"We will be a tax cutting government - in all normal circumstances we will reduce the burden of taxation. Such a policy is economically right and it is morally right.\" </p> <p>The Tories pledged to match Labour spending in health and education, but to cut spending in other areas. The document said: \"Government cannot spend what the nation hasn't earnt. It is not sustainable for government spending to grow faster than national income.\" </p> <p> <b> Europe</b> </p> <p>Mr Hague reiterated his pledge to oppose the European single currency for the lifetime of the next parliament. He also promised to oppose moves towards a \"fully integrated superstate\" by introducing new legislation to prevent EU law from overriding the will of parliament, except in areas ceded by Westminster. </p> <p>The document said: \"Down one road lies a fully integrated superstate, with nation states and the national veto disappearing. This is the route down which Britain is gradually disappearing. The alternative route, our route, is to a Europe of nations combining in different combinations for different purposes and to a different extent, a network of Europe.\" </p> <p> <b> Law and order</b> </p> <p>A war \"as never before\" would be waged against criminals. The Tories pledged to reverse the cuts in police numbers; overhaul the law in favour of the likes of the Norfolk farmer Tony Martin who was jailed for murdering a burglar; abolish the early release scheme; and to hand out mandatory sentences to drug dealers who sell to children. </p> <p>\"Crime is rising again and yet there are fewer police,\" the document said. \"Violent crime is soaring and yet thousands of violent offenders have been released early from jail. The mainstream majority thinks that government is too often on the side of the criminal rather than the victim.\" </p> <p> <b> Education</b> </p> <p>Central control over education would be ended by funding schools directly and using government auctions to set up multi-billion pound endowments to fund Britain's universities. </p> <p>The document said: \"Too much central political interference is damaging standards in our schools. Parents instinctively know what makes a good school. It is a place with an enthusiasm for learning and with a strong ethos and values. We want to give schools the freedom to become such places.\" </p> <p> <b> Inner cities</b> </p> <p>Britain's inner cities would become \"attractive, clean and crime-free places\" through a series of \"radical new approaches\". The worst tower blocks will be pulled down and new laws will be introduced to crack down on \"bad neighbours\". </p> <p> <b> Family</b> </p> <p>The Tories will attempt to win back their reputation as the party of the family by restoring the married couples' tax allowance. They would also introduce \"family scholarships\" to help parents to retrain when they return to work after taking a break to look after their children. </p> <p>Mr Hague said his proposals amounted to an ambitious alternative for Britain which the British people would embrace. \"Believing in Britain is a striking new social agenda for Conservatism based on one very simple, very Conservative principle: freedom,\" Mr Hague said. \"Freedom for parents, for families, for pensioners, for teachers and doctors and nurses.\" </p> <p> <b>Main points:</b> <br></p> <p>\u0095 Young people to be provided with state-funded alternative to basic state pension </p> <p>\u0095 Health secretary to be deprived of day to day role in running the NHS and centrally-imposed waiting lists to be dropped </p> <p>\u0095 Taxes to be cut \"in all normal circumstances\". Tories would match Labour funding on health and education, but cut spending in other areas </p> <p>\u0095 Pound would be saved for lifetime of next parliament as Tories oppose moves to \"fully integrated superstate\" </p> <p>\u0095 Fall in police numbers to be reversed and prisoner early release scheme to be abolished</p>",
  "The gloves are coming off in the US presidential race after months of phoney war sparring and boomerang polls. Labor Day electoral surveys, taken as a whole, confirm the contest as finely balanced and likely to remain so down to the November 7 finishing line. In prospect is possibly the closest result since 1976 when Jimmy Carter pipped Gerald Ford. Psephologists calculate that, following the party conventions, the rival camps are now fighting over a mere five million undecided votes among the 103m people expected to cast a ballot (out of 205m of voting age). This target audience can be shrunk further, to the fewer than one million undecideds who live in key battleground states. <p>The need to sustain nationwide appeal while wooing elusive swing voters is only one of the pressures now crowding in on the campaigns. They know they are entering the killing ground of presidential politics, a time when candidates begin to show their true colours and to make mistakes. Thus the Democrat Al Gore, over-compensating for his charisma gap, naively explains that he is \"not a natural politician\". Unnatural perhaps? Or simply inept? And thus the Republican George W Bush, his \"keep smiling\" media management lessons forgotten, is caught waspishly describing a reporter as a \"major league asshole\". How does he know? Perhaps Mr Bush has finally found an issue on which he is expert. </p> <p>From silly to nasty is but a short step in these hothouse days. Regressing towards the negative tactics of his primary shootout with John McCain, a new Bush commercial portrays his rival as untrustworthy and untruthful. Mr Gore, wrangling over TV debate schedules, accuses his opponent of running scared from public scrutiny. The candidates' mutual dislike grows ever more obvious. With so little margin for error, it can only get more brutal. And informative. For as policy and personal differences sharpen, America's choice gets clearer by the day.</p>",
  "On the eve of a last attempt by President Clinton to untangle the most vexing problem in the Middle East - the status of Jerusalem - one of Yasser Arafat's most trusted lieutenants said yesterday the Palestinians would be willing to make bold compromises on their claims to the holy city. <p>In a speech to the European parliament in Strasbourg, Ahmed Qureia said the Palestinians would support internationalising all of Jerusalem - including Arab East Jerusalem, occupied illegally by Israel since 1967 - should the two sides fail to reach a final settlement in the crucial weeks ahead. </p> <p>\"Unless we can reach an agreement on Jerusalem, I have to declare that both parts of Jerusalem east and west should be a unified international Jerusalem ... not just the capital of Israel or Palestine, but a capital of the world,\" said Mr Qureia, who is speaker of the Palestinian parliament. </p> <p>The proposal revives a formula put forward by the UN in 1947 and since repeatedly rejected by Israel, and opposed by the Palestinians, though it still remains part of European foreign policy. </p> <p>President Clinton is to begin talks today with Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, and Mr Arafat, meeting each separately on the sidelines of the millennium summit in New York. </p> <p>The meetings at the Waldorf Astoria have caused some to hope that during the hubbub of the three-day summit of 150 world leaders, Mr Clinton will somehow produce the miracle that eluded him in two weeks of concentrated negotiations at Camp David last July. </p> <p>Mr Clinton has likened the experience of those talks to having teeth extracted without painkillers, and strongly criticised Mr Arafat for his unwillingness to match Israeli compromises on Jerusalem. </p> <p>Some Palestinians hope that yesterday's proposal from such a senior figure as Mr Qureia, popularly known as Abu Ala and seen as a possible successor to the ailing Mr Arafat - could relieve some of the pressure on the Palestinian leader during his New York talks. </p> <p>\"He said it to try to throw forward an idea that would be acceptable among Europeans and internationally,\" said Nabil Khatib, director of the media centre of Bir Zeit University in the West Bank town of Ramallah. </p> <p>\"The Palestinians have a feeling that Israel is trying to give the impression that they [the Israelis] are the only ones who are making concessions. Abu Ala is trying to show that the Palestinian people are also ready for concessions, but not one-sided, and not concessions to Israel. The concession is to have a new kind of solution.\" </p> <p>Accepting current Israeli proposals on Jerusalem, which would restrict Palestinian sovereignty to a few outer neighbourhoods of the city, would be impossible for Mr Arafat to justify to his people. </p> <p>\"Mr Barak wants everyone to comply with his version of how things should be: occupiers' law,\" said Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestinian legislative council. \"But the issue is not just the holy sites, the issue is Jerusalem as a city.\" Real solutions were needed, not just symbolic ones. </p> <p>Mr Clinton is to use the meetings with Mr Arafat and Mr Barak to see whether to hold a second summit, possibly in October. But American officials say they first need to see signs of further progress since July's Camp David talks. \"Unless there is forward progress, unless we see a decisive way forward from this week ... this [reaching a deal] gets more and more difficult,\" the US national security adviser, Sandy Berger told reporters. </p> <p>So far signs of progress do not appear forthcoming. Israeli and Palestinian officials have tried to dampen expectations of a breakthrough before September 13, the latest deadline for a final settlement. </p> <p>Israeli officials say it is up to Mr Arafat to react to proposals since Camp David which blur the issue of sovereignty over the holy places in the old walled city of Jerusalem. \"Arafat's moment of truth has come and the Palestinian leader must make political decisions rather than turn the negotiations into a bickering match,\" the Israeli foreign ministry said on Monday. </p> <p>Instead, they are trying to press Mr Arafat to accept a dispensation for Jerusalem, offered since Camp David, that would dodge the question of ownership over the sanctified ground in the old walled city by declaring God the sovereign of holy places. </p> <p>The US version of these proposals would have Israel controlling the Wailing Wall, the holiest shrine of Judaism, and the Palestinians in control of the Haram al-Sharif, the third holiest site in Islam, with God the sovereign of the passage between them. </p> <p>Mr Arafat has come under mounting pressure from the US and Israel to accept the proposals, which are endorsed by Egypt and Jordan. After the last Camp David talks ended without agreement, Mr Arafat went to more than two dozen countries looking for support but found himself being urged to hold off on declaring a Palestinian state on September 13. On that, Mr Arafat appears to have yielded, and a meeting of Palestinian legislators in Gaza at the weekend is likely to support postponing such a declaration until later in the year. \"September 13 is not a sacred date,\" said Faruq Qaddumi, a senior Palestinian official. </p> <p>But time is working against a settlement. The US presidential election campaign is expected to occupy much of Mr Clinton's energy from now until the vote in November, and Mr Barak is barely hanging on to power. Stripped of a parliamentary majority, his government is surviving thanks to the summer recess in the Israeli knesset. </p> <p>If Mr Barak fails to reach a deal with Mr Arafat, he may resort to a new coalition with the rightwing Likud party, which opposes the compromises he offered at Camp David. Yesterday Mr Barak was hedging his bets, telephoning the Likud party leader, Ariel Sharon, from New York even as he awaited today's meeting with Mr Clinton.</p>",
  "President Bill Clinton will give his backing today to a proposal to reform the UN's peacekeeping activities after their disastrous failures in Rwanda, Srebrenica and Sierra Leone. <p>In the opening speech of the three-day UN millennium summit he will tell the leaders of more than 150 countries that the US endorses the establishment of a permanent peacekeeping high command to replace the present slow, ad hoc arrangement. </p> <p>But wrangling over who will meet the peacekeeping bill continued behind the scenes. The changes will run into millions of pounds and the US is desperately trying to reduce its share of peacekeeping costs. </p> <p>The US endorsement virtually guarantees acceptance of the peacekeeping reforms, published last month, drawn up by a UN panel headed by Lakhdar Brahimi, a former Algerian foreign minister. </p> <p>In Srebrenica, the UN was humiliated when its peacekeepers stood by while more than 7,000 men and boys were massacred by Serbs. A more catastrophic failure occurred in Rwanda, where up to a million were massacred. </p> <p>In Sierra Leone this year, 500 UN peacekeepers were taken hostage by a rebel force. </p> <p>As well as a permanent high command, the reform includes giving peacekeepers clearer-cut mandates and \"robust\" rules of engagement. Such changes might have helped in the Balkans, where UN peacekeepers found themselves unable to intervene because they did not have a mandate. </p> <p>But the UN reforms are in danger of being overshadowed by a series of meetings Mr Clinton is holding on the sidelines to try to revive the Middle East peace talks. Today he will have separate meetings with the Palestinian authority president, Yasser Arafat, and the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak. </p> <p>Sporadic demonstrations were held on the eve of the summit. Four Iranians were arrested for throwing yellow paint and another for disorderly conduct outside the hotel of the Iranian president, Mohammad Khatami. </p> <p>The city has given permits for 91 demonstrations during the summit, but there has been no sign of a repeat of the protests by anti-globalisation activists which caused mayhem in Seattle last year and in Washington earlier this year. </p> <p>Many of the leaders of the trade unions and environmental groups involved in those clashes have laid down their banners and teargas masks for the weekand are talking to representatives of big business and government at an alternative conference being staged in the city. </p> <p>More than 1,000 representatives from round the world gathered at the New York Hilton, about a mile from the UN headquarters, yesterday for the opening of the State of the World Forum. </p> <p>It is a diverse gathering, bringing together politicians, academics, soldiers, New Age spiritualists, representatives of multinational companies, as well as the trade union leaders and the environmental lobby. </p> <p>Jim Garrison, its organiser, said the Seattle protests had been beneficial in bursting the euphoria about globalisation. </p> <p>Mr Garrison, 49, an American academic and veteran campaigner against the nuclear arms race, said the forum was about channelling the protests which had been useful in focusing attention on the problems of globalisation. </p> <p>He added: \"We have to move from protest to engagement.\" </p> <p>The opening day of the forum brought together figures such as John Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO trade union organisation, George Soros, the financier, and Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet president. </p> <p>Helen Clark, the New Zealand prime minister, who will speak at the UN millennium summit, made the trip across Manhattan to address the alternative forum. </p> <p>Other leaders scheduled to attend include Thabo Mbeki, the president of South Africa, and Olusegun Obsanjo, the Nigerian president. </p> <p>Mr Garrison said globalisation was ruthless, and questions such as the unequal distribution of wealth and the impact on the environment had to be discussed. He added that talks did not mean that future protests were ruled out. </p> <p>\u0095 North Korea announced yesterday that it had pulled out of the UN summit after a confrontation between its delegation and US security officials while they were passing though Frankfurt airport. </p> <p>The deputy foreign minister, Choe Su-hon, said the delegation decided to return home after \"rude and provocative\" treatment by US security staff, whom he accused of strip-searching members of the presidential entourage. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.worldforum.org/\" target=\"_NEW\">www.worldforum.org</a></p>",
  "The European Commission, led by Chris Patten, its foreign policy commissioner, is pushing for two new nuclear power plants to replace the reactor at Chernobyl when it closes at the end of this year, 14 years after the world's worst environmental disaster. <p>In defiance of growing concern in western Europe about nuclear energy, the commission meets today to approve far-reaching recommendations which call on European taxpayers to subsidise the completion of two nuclear plants in Ukraine and one in Russia, the countries with the worst safety records in Europe. </p> <p>Ukraine finally agreed this summer to close the last of the four Chernobyl reactors in December in return for US and European help in dismantling it. Although it no longer insists that a new reactor must be built to make up for the energy loss, the European commission is pressing for this. </p> <p>A report to today's meeting - the first full discussion of nuclear power since the forming of the new commission last year - recommends loan support for completing two mothballed Soviet nuclear plants at Khmelnitsky and Rivne (known as K2R4). The report was authorised by Chris Patten and G\u00fcnther Verheugen, the commissioner in charge of EU enlargement. </p> <p>\"The commission is considering a Euratom loan with complimentary financing from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development [EBRD] and bilateral export credit agencies,\" says the report, obtained by the Guardian. It proposes to go on with the project \"to ensure, through constant political dialogue with Ukraine, that these two reactors are completed to the highest possible safety standard\". </p> <p>When support for nuclear power is falling in western Europe, and Germany is committed to phasing it out, analysts find it surprising that the commission should still be pressing for its expansion in eastern Europe. </p> <p>\"It's extraordinary that this is happening when no member country of the European Union is building or has any plans for new nuclear plants. The last one opened in February at Civaux in France,\" Tobias Munchmeyer, a nuclear expert with Greenpeace, said. </p> <p>\"It looks like the last effort by the ailing nuclear industry in France and Germany to get contracts in Europe. China is the only remaining country with potential, since other states in Asia like South Korea and India are looking to buy from Asian companies.\" </p> <p>The report from Mr Patten and Mr Verheugen calls for \"a more proactive policy with Russia\". This would include support for Russian requests for Euratom financing for completing a reactor known as Kalinin 3. </p> <p>If the recommendations are adopted, Greenpeace and other anti-nuclear campaigners fear it could set a precedent for a whole new generation of nuclear plants to be built in eastern Europe. Until now, the EU has been moving in the opposite direction by urging applicant countries, in particular Bulgaria, Slovakia, and Lithuania, to close down their Chernobyl-type reactors. </p> <p>The commission's recommendation also raised eyebrows yesterday because Ukraine already has spare nuclear capacity. </p> <p>\"It has large installed excess capacity,\" an industry analyst said. \"But its problem is that it does not have the money to buy gas or nuclear fuel from Russia. Last winter there was a heating crisis because four of the 13 reactors in Ukraine didn't operate because of cash difficulties.\" </p> <p>Mr Patten and Mr Verheugen seem to be motivated by a cold-war-era conviction that Ukraine should not depend on Russia for its energy supplies. </p> <p>Even if their recommendations get past the other commissioners today, they will still have to be approved by member governments in the council of ministers. The European parliament is also likely to put up strong resistance. </p> <p>Another hurdle is EBRD approval. Under its statutes the bank can only approve the lowest-cost option for any project loan, and it may be hard to prove that completing the plants is cheap. </p> <p>\"Euratom, which is pushing this loan, supports the nuclear industry. It is an anomaly that this one energy lobby has a treaty-based existence within the EU's structures,\" Antony Froggatt, an independent energy consultant, said. </p> <p>Mr Patten's spokesman, Gunnar Wiegand, said he could not deny that there was a policy dilemma, but added: \"It's good to remember that a commitment was made to Ukraine in the G7's memorandum of understanding in 1995. The west promised then to help to provide Ukraine with alternative energy capacity when Chernobyl was closed. That doesn't exclude nuclear power.\"</p>"
