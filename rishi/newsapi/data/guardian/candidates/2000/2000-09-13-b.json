  "The increasingly accident-prone Bush presidential campaign was accused of dirty tricks yesterday, after it was discovered that the word \"rats\" appeared subliminally in a Republican political broadcast targeting Democratic health care proposals. <p>The offending word, in large white capital letters, flashes against a black background for a thirtieth of a second as a woman narrator criticises Vice President Al Gore's plan for government funding of prescriptions for pensioners. </p> <p>George W Bush ridiculed as \"bizarre and weird\" accusations that his campaign was trying to use such underhand techniques to discredit his opponent. Yesterday, however, he announced that the $2.5m (\u00a31.3m) advertising campaign would be withdrawn. </p> <p>Alex Castellanos, the Republican campaigner responsible for producing the advertisment denied trying to send subliminal messages. </p> <p>\"We don't play ball that way. I'm not that clever,\" he said. </p> <p>However, Mr Castellanos has been involved in controversial political broadcasts before. In 1990 he produced an advertisement for the rightwing Republican senator for North Carolina, Jesse Helms, which used racial imagery in a contest with a black businessman, Harvey Gant. At one point a white pair of hands receives a job rejection letter and crumples it up, but for a fraction of a second the letter fades to a picture of Mr Gant and the hands appear to be crushing his head. </p> <p>Kathleen Hall Jamieson, who analyses the advertisement in her book Dirty Politics: Deception, Distraction and Democracy, said Mr Castellanos insisted then that the imagery was accidental. Ms Jamieson believes the Helms advertisement was the first instance of subliminal imagery in US political advertising and Mr Castellanos's \"rats advertisement\" is the second. </p> <p>Gore campaign workers were scarcely able to contain their glee yesterday as the Bush campaign was forced into emergency damage limitation for the second time in eight days, at a time when it is losing ground in the polls. </p> <p>Last Monday - apparently unaware that he was speaking close to a live microphone - Mr Bush was overheard describing a New York Times reporter as \"a major-league asshole\". The reporter, Adam Clymer, had written a critical account of the Texas governor's record on health care, and the gaffe made Mr Bush appear peevish and unsettled. </p> <p>Campaigning in Florida yesterday, the candidate seemed rattled by the new controversy yesterday, struggling to pronounce the word \"subliminal\", and raising doubts as to whether he understood its meaning when he argued: \"The idea of one frame out of 900 hardly in my judgment makes a conspiracy.\" </p> <p>After seeing a double-digit lead in the polls evaporate in less than a month, splits have emerged in the Bush camp over how to pursue the campaign, and when to \"go negative\". Last week the candidate's staff were trying to increase their control over the Republican National Committee's campaign office responsible for producing political broadcasts, because it was unhappy about the harshly negative tone of some of its output. </p> <p>Mr Castellanos insisted that the word had appeared accidentally as part of a visual effect which broke up words from campaign slogans into fragments and flashed them across the screen. The word \"rats\" was supposed to be part of \"bureaucrats\", he said. </p> <p>In the controversial segment of the advertisement, other words and groups of letters appear before the slogan \"The Gore Prescription Plan: Bureaucrats Decide\" crystallises on the screen. However, the word \"rats\" is larger than the other word-fragments. </p> <p>The word was spotted only after 4,400 screenings in 33 regions, by a Democratic supporter in Seattle, Gary Greenup, who alerted his local party. </p> <p>\"Initially, I was just kind of intrigued... but when I taped it and looked it I thought this is not really very good. It's somewhat underhand and a little bit devious and it should be brought to light.\"</p>",
  "<p>Gloomy rock lyrics do not make enough difference to the rate of suicides among young people to justify censorship, music researchers announced yesterday after an exhaustive computer analysis of over a thousand British hit songs. </p> <p>Psychologists Adrian North, of Leicester University, and David Hargreaves, of Surrey University, gathered the lyrics from every top five single in the UK between 1960 and 1998 - about 1,400 songs in all - and fed them into a computer which graded them by key words for pessimism, optimism, certainty, doubt, and two dozen other qualities. </p> <p>\"We found no evidence of an increase in suicide rates when the number of pessimistic songs went up,\" Professor North told the British Association science festival in London. </p> <p>The analysis is one of the biggest efforts of its kind and comes as one of the most ardent supporters of rock music censorship - Tipper Gore, the wife of the US presidential contender Al Gore - looks likely to wield power and influence as first lady. </p> <p>Previous studies in the US have included a 1992 investi gation which suggested that the suicide rate among urban white adult males went up in proportion to the amount of country music played on the radio, and claims that there was a correlation between suicide rates and subscriptions to heavy metal magazines. Both studies were heavily criticised for questionable conclusions about cause and effect. </p> <p>The latest research shows little evidence of a cause and effect relationship between pessimistic lyrics and suicide. \"There is evidence both ways,\" said Prof North. \"There is not a balanced case for censorship. Nor can we say it doesn't matter what songs are about.\" </p> <p>Computer analysis of the new pop databank is still being carried out, but has already thrown up intriguing correlations in other areas. Optimism in music tended to be followed by an econ- omic upturn in the following quarter. </p> <p>North and Hargreaves cautioned against reading too much into the figures - does music affect moods, or does mood affect choice of music? But they revealed other research findings which showed that consumer behaviour could be manipulated by the right choice of music. </p> <p>In one experiment, the psychologists set up a supermarket display of French and German wines. When boulevard accordion music was played, French wine outsold German by five bottles to one; when oompah band music was put on, the German wine gained a two to one advantage. </p> <p>Other studies have shown that when businesses increase the tempo of music, customers tend to speed up what they are doing - in supermarkets, they whizz round the aisles faster, and in pubs they drink more quickly. </p> <p>Some results have been less predictable. North and Hargreaves put an advert in a local paper, the Leicester Mercury, asking people to dial a number to take part in a survey. When they called they were put on hold, played one of three tapes - a verbal message asking them to hold, Beatles songs, or pan pipes covers of Beatles songs and timed to see how long they would wait. </p> <p>Callers preferred music to words. But asked to choose between original Beatles and pan pipes, they chose the pipes. </p> <p>\"When we asked people why they liked pan pipe Beatles better than Beatles, they said it was because it was the kind of music you usually get when you're waiting to be put through,\" said Dr Hargreaves.</p>",
  "<b> Plot to kill Putin</b> <br> <p>The Ukrainian and Russian security services claimed yesterday that Chechen assassins planned to kill President Vladimir Putin during the Kursk submarine crisis last month. </p> <p>Leonid Derkach, the head of Ukraine's security service, said four Chechens were detained in the run-up to a summit of leaders of former Soviet countries (CIS) in the Crimea in mid-August. They were \"suspected of preparing an attempt on the life of Vladimir Putin and deported from Ukraine,\" he said. <br><b>Ian Traynor</b>, Moscow <br></p> <p><b> Harare bombs</b><br> </p> <p>A hand grenade attack on the headquarters of Zimbabwe's opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, damaged the building and two vehicles in central Harare. </p> <p>Police arrived late at the scene of the blast on Monday night, and left soon after, prompting MDC secretary-general Welshman Ncube to criticise them for not launching a serious investigation. \"This is obviously part of the terror campaign being waged by the state against any opposition to the ruling party, Zanu-PF,\" he said. <br><b>Andrew Meldrum</b>, Harare </p> <p><br> <b> Mauritius poll</b><br> </p> <p>The prime minister of Mauritius, Navin Ramgoolam, yesterday conceded defeat in the Indian Ocean island's general election. </p> <p>\"I recognise my party's defeat,\" Mr Ramgoolam said as tallies showed a virtual landslide defeat of his alliance by a coalition of the Socialist Militant Party and the Militant Party. <br> <b>Reuters</b>, Port Louis </p> <p><br> <b> Holy waters</b><br> </p> <p>A Spanish priest yesterday led a bible reading in an underwater cave off Benitachell in south-eastern Spain, as part of the Catholic Church in Valencia's attempt at non-stop bible readings throughout 2000. <br><b>Reuters</b>, Benitachell</p>"
