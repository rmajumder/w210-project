  "<p>Fresh evidence that US oil stocks are drying up caused a sharp jump in the price of crude oil yesterday as Bill Clinton warned that economic growth in the west could be harmed by the present level of prices. </p> <p>Mr Clinton warned Opec that oil prices above $30 a barrel could provoke a recession in the industrialised world which would cut demand for oil, harming the producers as well. He called on the cartel to help bring prices down to $20-25 a barrel. </p> <p>Mr Clinton promised to discuss oil production levels at a meeting in Lagos this weekend with Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo. Opec is set to meet in early September, but the cartel has given conflicting messages in recent weeks about whether it will turn on the taps to ease prices. </p> <p>Extra oil from the cartel had been expected to replenish dwindling western stockpiles but new figures yesterday showed another sharp decline in US oil reserves. Statistics from the American Petroleum Institute marked US crude stocks in the week to August 18 down 7.7m barrels at 279.7m - 11% lower than at the same time last year. </p> <p>\"This is clearly a shockingly large draw,\" said Lawrence Eagles of head of commodities research at brokers GNI. </p> <p>Brent blend futures by late afternoon in London had risen $1.24 to $31.18 a barrel, while US light crude sped $1.56 higher to $32.78. Prices are now back near the 10 year peak reached earlier this month. Speaking in London, Mr Obasanjo, agreed that excessive prices were bad both for oil producers and consumers. \"Oil producers should try to work out a medium [price],\" he said. </p> <p>Opec meets on September 10 to decide new quotas, but it is not clear if they will bow to western pressure and increase production.</p>",
  "A mysterious group of \"fanatical Turks\" threatened to assassinate the former prime minister David Lloyd George, according to a secret police report released yesterday at the public record office. <p>The report, dated January 1923, warned that two men had declared \"their willingness to act as assassins\" at a little-known Conference of Orientals in Munich. They were identifed as \"Ali Bey and Haidar\". </p> <p>The initial proposal at the bizarre gathering was even more extreme. Indian representatives were reported to have favoured \"violence and the extermination of all Englishmen on one day\". </p> <p>This motion was regarded as a little strong for some of those present, in particular the Egyptians. They pointed to the danger of the plan misfiring \"as the English would then have the moral support of the whole world in refusing to evacuate Egypt\". </p> <p>The proposal was finally rejected by a majority, according to the report, based on information from what the special branch described as \"Indian sources\". </p> <p>Instead there was \"general approval\" that \"sentence of death\" be passed on Lloyd George who \"represented unhappiness for the whole of the Orient\". </p> <p>Similar sentences were passed on two others, including one Colonel Maxwell. \"Have you any idea who Colonel Maxwell can be?\" asked Colonel Carter, a senior special branch officer, to his colleague, Inspector Randall. </p> <p>The documents released yesterday shed no further light on the matter. However, Carter advised Randall, the prime minister's protection officer: \"I think you ought to be most careful to keep an eye open for the Turks or lower-class Greeks who may be wandering about and endeavouring to get too near to Mr Lloyd George\". </p> <p>That was not the only plan to assassinate Lloyd George. An earlier report of a plot to kill the prime minister was sent to special branch by Sir Mansfield Cumming, a monocled retired naval officer who was the first head of MI6. </p> <p>The letter is signed in green ink, then as now the practice of the Chief, as he is officially called, of MI6.</p>",
  "A few years ago the derelict building just down the road from the market place in this small highland town in Chiapas was a focus of world attention. Today it decays silently, ignored by all but a scavenging stray dog, with nothing to show that it housed the last serious attempt to negotiate an end to the Zapatistas' battle for indigenous rights. <p>The San Andres accords, signed here in February 1996, promised Mexico's indigenous communities political and cultural autonomy in partial redress of the centuries of discrimination and violence which lay behind the Zapatista uprising, which took the state by storm on New Year's Day 1994. </p> <p>But President Ernesto Zedillo shelved the agreement before the year was out, Sub-Comandante Marcos took his masked rebels back to their jungle hideouts, and the unarmed Zapatista faithful in San Andres were left to experiment with self-government on their own. </p> <p>Four years later they are still there, occupying the old town hall on the opposite side of the square from the official town authorities, and waiting to see if their world is about to be shaken once again now that the old political order dominated by the PRI, the Institutional Revolutionary party, has collapsed. </p> <p>\"We just don't know what to think yet,\" said the mayor, Marcos Gonzalez, a small earnest man who insisted that the Zapatista authorities had a lot to do, despite having no resources to do it with and consequently dwindling support. </p> <p>\"Things could get better, or things could get worse,\" Felipe Diez said as he sat behind an old cast-iron pedal sewing machine in his tailor's shop just off the square, his world-weary smile betraying a hint of excitement. </p> <p>A political earthquake shook Mexico's foundations on July 2 when Vicente Fox of the National Action party won the presidential election and ended the PRI's 71-year monopoly of national government. </p> <p>The aftershock came on Sunday, when the PRI lost the Chiapas state governorship to Pablo Salazar, who has the support of a broad alliance. </p> <p>Both men have announced a new peace drive for Chiapas. Mr Fox promises to dust off the San Andres accords and reconsider the military's role in the state, and Mr Salazar has committed himself to going after the local PRI bosses and the paramilitary groups associated with them. </p> <p>They hope this will bring the Zapatistas back to the negotiating table to end the conflict, which has brought its supporters nothing but more poverty and harassment. </p> <p>\"They say they will be different but seeing is believing, and we haven't seen it yet,\" Mr Gonzalez said. </p> <p>\"They've got to prove they are serious,\" said Mr. Diez. </p> <p>Both said it was that realistic scepticism which was keeping Sub-Commandante Marcos from reacting to the new situation. </p> <p>He is usually given to long poetic communiques on national issues, but has yet to utter a word on the collapse of the PRI, for so long the rebels' primary enemy. </p> <p>\"He's not going to fall into a trap,\" Mr. Diez said. </p> <p>\"The uprising took place because the government is only interested in exploiting us. Maybe the new ones are different and it can be resolved, but it will need 10 or 15 years at least, and it will never be solved if the people continue [to be] so poor they can hardly afford their daily maize and beans.\" </p> <p>The mayor said that for the talks to resume the villages and towns in the conflict zone would have to be demilitarised and the San Andres accords put back on track. </p> <p>The situation in San Andres is unusual in that most Zapatista autonomous municipalities were formed in smaller settlements with no rival official authority. But somehow the two sides manage to coexist. </p> <p>\"San Andres is a singular case. It's not exactly a model of reconciliation, more of an example of reluctant tolerance,\" Francisco Gallardo of the civil rights group Alianza Civica said. </p> <p>But the delicate balance here will have to adapt to the PRI's collapse. No one seems to know how, and many fear that tension will return. </p> <p>\"There are rumours that the paramilitaries are getting ready to attack if the PRI loses,\" Mr. Gonzalez said, recalling the massacre of 45 people by a PRI-linked group in Acteal, just a couple of hill tops away, three years ago. </p> <p>\"They are only rumours, but it has happened before in other places so it could happen again.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Four people were killed and up to 38 injured in the isolated Chiapas hamlet of Pena Limonar, 90 miles north-east of the city of San Cristobal de las Casas, on Tuesday, the Televisa network reported. </p> <p>Officials said the state prosecutor's investigators had not yet reported from the scene, a five-hour drive from the nearest town, adding that the clash appeared to concern a land dispute between Zapatista and PRI supporters.</p>",
  "<b> Reno rules out Gore inquiry</b> <br> <p> The US attorney general, Janet Reno, will not appoint special counsel to investigate vice-president Al Gore's 1996 campaign fundraising activities, it was announced yesterday. </p> <p>After reviewing a transcript of an April interview between Mr Gore and federal investigators, she concluded that \"I have decided that a special counsel is not warranted.
