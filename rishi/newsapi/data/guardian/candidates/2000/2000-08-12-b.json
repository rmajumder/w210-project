  "<b> When did you first become a manager?</b> <p>About 10 years ago, when I was promoted from within a sales team to be manager. The team was strong and I had a boss who focused on the few things I did right. </p> <p><b> What has been your best moment in management?</b> </p> <p>Being part of a team which struggled with itself and with results, and leading it to great success. It was life changing. </p> <p><b> What was your greatest mistake?</b> </p> <p>I try not to dwell on mistakes. Anything worth chasing requires constant re-evaluation. </p> <p><b> Which deal would you most like to have done?</b> </p> <p>I wish I had seen the opportunity and led the team who built eSchwab. </p> <p><b> What do you find most annoying in your staff?</b> </p> <p>I can't think of anything. </p> <p><b> Does your organisation have a glass ceiling?</b> </p> <p>I've certainly not found one. There is such an enormous shortage of skills in our industry that it would be crazy. </p> <p><b> What management wisdom is most over-rated?</b> </p> <p>Motivation will almost always beat talent. </p> <p><b> What lesson would you pass on to budding managers?</b> </p> <p>Surround yourself with people better than you are. Give them clear directions and get out of their way. </p> <p><b> Which management guru do you believe in?</b> </p> <p>I admire Jack Welch of General Electric enormously. </p> <p><b> Who is your management hero?</b> </p> <p>Richard Branson. </p> <p><b> How much were you paid last year?</b> </p> <p>In my business you get paid in cash and in experience. </p> <p><b> If you could change one aspect of British business, what would it be?</b> </p> <p>To see businesses adopting a more aggressive approach in how they use new technology . </p> <p><b> What phrase or saying do you most over-use?</b> </p> <p>Change before you're forced to. </p> <p><b> Apart from quality time with your family, what else makes you happiest in life</b> ? </p> <p>Winning. </p> <p><b> What annoys you most?</b> </p> <p>People giving up. Failing is not falling flat on your face, it's not getting up. </p> <p><b> How do you relax?</b> </p> <p>I don't. I have a passion for cars and motorbikes which is a distraction. </p> <p><b> What was your last cultural experience?</b> </p> <p>My wife and I had a week in Buenos Aires, a mix of sounds, sights and tastes. </p> <p><b> What is your favourite city?</b> </p> <p>New York. </p> <p><b> Favourite journey?</b> </p> <p>On a Sunday morning I cycle to the newsagent with my two young daughters. </p> <p><b> What is your greatest regret?</b> </p> <p>Not buying Cisco at $1 in 1995. </p> <p><b> What is your biggest fear?</b> </p> <p>Cisco at $1 any time soon. </p> <p><b> What would you really like to have been?</b> </p> <p>I have a sneaking suspicion that one day I'll wish I had pursued my ambition to be part of the McLaren Formula 1 racing team.</p>",
  "Lech Walesa, the founding father of independent Poland was yesterday acquitted on charges of collaborating with communist era secret police after it emerged that key documents used against him in a Warsaw court were forgeries made by a special unit set up to discredit him. <p>Poland's best-known anti-communist activist and founder of the Solidarity movement faced two weeks of court hearings which critics branded a humiliation for Poland in the eyes of the world. </p> <p>Mr Walesa, 59, passionately maintained that police files which emerged earlier this year, indicating that he spied on fellow dissidents as agent Bolek, were forgeries. </p> <p>The prosecutor at the closed hearing, Krzysztof Kauba, called for the case to be stopped after newly discovered documents were presented to the court, indicating that the secret police established a special unit to discredit Walesa in the 1980s. </p> <p>An interior ministry report from 1985 outlined the use of forgers to produce documents making it appear Walesa was a paid agent. Some forged papers were sent to the Nobel committee in 1982 in an effort to stop him from winning its acclaimed peace prize. He received it a year later. </p> <p>Outside court, Mr Walesa said the case had been a waste of time and taxpayers' money. </p> <p>\"I'm not happy,\" he said. \"We have not progressed. Just as in the past, those who didn't be lieve don't believe, and those who did believe, believe.\" </p> <p>Before entering the courtroom for the final hearing, he had said: \"I was fighting the communists, and it was a life or death struggle.\" </p> <p>He said the hearings were part of a \"laughable, political vendetta against me by former enemies\", and he regretted the Polish secret services still had considerable clout. </p> <p>If found guilty, Mr Walesa, who steered Poland through the early years of democracy, faced being banned from holding public office for 10 years. He would also have been forbidden from voting. </p> <p>The ruling now clears the way for Mr Walesa, the country's first post-communist president, to run for president again in October's elections. </p> <p>The former Gdansk shipyard electrician is one of 18 candidates running for president in October. His supporters said the appearance of potentially incriminating documents at such a critical time was timed to upset his bid. </p> <p>Mr Walesa's acquittal comes just a day after the the country's incumbent president Aleksander Kwasniewski was cleared on similar charges. </p> <p>Mr Kwasniewski, to whom Mr Walesa lost the presidency five years ago and who is tipped to win October's election, has pledged to avenge the deeds of those he accuses of \"manipulating the evidence\" which brought him to court. His case was dropped after the prosecutor claimed there was a lack of evidence. </p> <p>Mr Walesa who was president from 1990 to 1995 enjoys little popular support these days, but is still seen affectionately as a symbol of the historic changes that ended the cold war. </p> <p>In an article in the latest edition of the current affairs magazine Wprost, Mr Walesa outlined his determination to clear his name. \"I decided to appear in court so that no one says I put myself above the law. This trial is against me, against my name and the most painful thing to me is that I'm put on the same weighing scales as president Kwasniewski. This proves how the history of the past 20 years is totally misunderstood.\" </p> <p>The trials of Mr Walesa and Mr Kwasniewski resulted from a law passed in 1997 which requires top officials, including presidential candidates, to declare past links to the secret police and forces the vetting of those applying for top posts. </p> <p>Critics say the recent cases prove the law is flawed, because accusations can be made on the basis of unsubstantiated evidence. </p> <p>It has also proved the Poles' painful struggle to come to terms with their past since the toppling of the communist regime in 1989. They will be forced to do a lot of uncomfortable soul-searching next year when former secret police files will be open to the public for the first time. </p> <p>Latest opinion polls show support among Poles for Mr Walesa's presidential candidature has risen by 1% over the last month to 4%. Mr Kwasniewski's support is 62%.</p>",
  "The veteran conservative activist Pat Buchanan was due to carry off the Reform party's presidential nomination last night, completing one of the more spectacular acts of political piracy in modern times. <p>But the question, after weeks of splits and culture wars in America's third party, was whether the Reform nomination - even with the $12.6m in federal election funds that goes with it - is any longer worth having. </p> <p>Changing political times and a debilitating internecine struggle have left the Reform party that Ross Perot built far adrift in the opinion polls. Even now, Mr Buchanan's victory is facing a court challenge from disgruntled supporters of his main rival, John Hagelin. </p> <p>Although Mr Buchanan will probably win the court battle, he has only three months in which to turn his divided and diminished new party into an effective force before the November 7 election. </p> <p>Few give Mr Buchanan much chance of having a significant impact on the presidential contest. The contrast with 1992, when Mr Perot won 19m votes - 18.8% of the total - and helped hand the White House to Bill Clinton, is enormous. Even 1996, when Mr Perot ran a second time, taking 8m votes - an 8.4% share - looks a distant dream for the ageing \"Buchanan brigades\". </p> <p>So damaging has the Buchanan takeover been for the Reform party - currently languishing at around 1% in the opinion polls - that the real third party challenge in the 2000 election has shifted from the right to the left and Ralph Nader's Green candidacy. </p> <p>After two elections in which the Democrats have seen the Republican challenge sapped by the effect of Mr Perot's anti-tax populist campaigns, it is the Democrats' turn to worry. Democratic loyalists are being tempted to desert their traditional political home in favour of a more radical, less equivocal, outside challenge. </p> <p>Four years ago, Mr Nader also ran as the Green candidate, winning less than 1% of the popular vote. His 685,000 votes in 1996 were eclipsed by the bigger contest between Mr Clinton, Bob Dole and Mr Perot. This time, judging by the early polls and the nervous mood among some Democrats, the Nader challenge is looking altogether more significant. </p> <p>The most recent Gallup opinion poll this week illustrated what is at stake. Conducted after Al Gore drafted Joseph Lieberman to the Democratic ticket on Monday, the Republican George W Bush led Mr Gore by 45% to 43%. Mr Nader was far behind in third place, but his 4% standing could make all the difference. Mr Buchanan was on 1 %. </p> <p>Mr Nader's significance should not be exaggerated. Nevertheless, assuming that he manages to get on the ballot in every state - which is by no means certain under America's state-based jungle of electoral regulations - Mr Nader poses a particular threat in states that Mr Gore has to win. </p> <p>Recent polls in Michigan show Mr Bush leading Mr Gore by 41%-35%, with Mr Nader's 7% holding the balance. In Minnesota Mr Bush leads 43%-40%, with Mr Nader on 5%. In Illinois, Mr Bush has a 46%-39% advantage, with Mr Nader on 6%, too close for Mr Gore's comfort. These are three vital states for Mr Gore. </p> <p>But the biggest potential nightmare for the Democrats is in California, the largest state in the US, and the one with the largest number of votes in the electoral college which ultimately decides who will be the next president. A recent statewide survey showed Mr Nader on 8%, his strongest performance in any single state. Mr Gore still leads Mr Bush in California, but the Nader factor remains a constant calculation. </p> <p>These are early days in the campaign and experience shows that third party challenges tend to be squeezed as election day nears and the big parties' superior financial resources make themselves felt. </p> <p>Even so, the third party story in the 2000 race is not that the Republicans are looking over their shoulders at Mr Buchanan - though they are - but that the Democrats are being forced to do the same with Mr Nader.</p>",
  "On the eve of the Democrats' convention, Vice-President Al Gore will be confronted tomorrow with an embarrassing conflict of interest which goes to the heart of the row over campaign financing in American politics. <p>Desperate efforts were being made behind the scenes last night to avoid a standoff between one of Mr Gore's main financial backers and the labour movement, whose support he also desperately needs. </p> <p>On Sunday night hundreds of leading Democrats plan to demonstrate outside Loews hotel in Santa Monica, where many of their number were due to stay during the convention. They will be there in support of hotel workers who are seeking recognition of their union. </p> <p>Among those due to attend the rally are the House minority leader, Richard Gephardt, who was spoken of as a possible vice-presidential candidate until Joseph Lieberman was chosen earlier this week; the Rev Jesse Jackson; and the president of the AFL-CIO union federation, John Sweeney. </p> <p>The hotel has had a long-running dispute between its president and chief executive officer, Jonathan Tisch, and the union, the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees. This has led to a series of arrests of union activists and has turned the hotel into a rallying point for the union movement in Los Angeles. </p> <p>On Thursday night, a further 58 people were arrested outside the hotel. </p> <p>Mr Tisch is not only a major fundraiser for the Democrats but also a close friend and supporter of Mr Gore. </p> <p>Money is essential to the Gore-Lieberman bid particularly because the George W Bush campaign is being so heavily financed by corporate interests. This means that Mr Tisch is regarded as a key figure by the Democrats' fundraising team. </p> <p>In an attempt to settle the dispute before the Democrats arrive, the hotel agreed earlier this week to post notices saying that they will not \"threaten our employees with harm\" or \"interrogate our employees about their union activities\". </p> <p>Then, on Thursday, Mr Tisch took out a full-page advertisement in the Los Angeles Times justifying the hotel's stance and saying that its position was \"not about 'busting' unions, it is about trusting employees to make the choice\". </p> <p>If Mr Gore fails to back the unions, the labour movement may question his credentials and shift some of their allegiances to Green party candidate, Ralph Nader. He will also lay himself open to the accusation that he is in some way obliged to his financial backers. If he does back the union, he risks alienating an old friend and ally. </p> <p>\"Tisch is throwing down a gauntlet to the leadership of the Democratic party,\" David Koff, a union official, said last night. He suggested that Mr Tisch's position highlighted the issue of \"big money\" as opposed to \"working class families\", about whom Mr Gore and Mr Lieberman have made much in their pitch. </p> <p>The demonstration at the hotel is one of many street protests planned in the city this week. In preparation for possible trouble, 3,000 National Guardsmen have been drafted in to assist the Los Angeles police department (LAPD) and concrete blocks weighing 4,500kg (almost 10,00lb) have been planted across streets around the convention centre. </p> <p>The organisers of the various demonstrations stressed yesterday that they are seeking non-violent protest. They said that the difference between next week's demonstrations and those against the World Trade Organisation in Seattle earlier this year was that there was no intention of stopping the convention taking place. </p> <p>The fear has been expressed that the LAPD may try to arrest some organisers for conspiracy before the protests have even started. A total of 391 people were arrested during last week's protests at the Republican convention in Philadelphia and more than 100 were still being held yesterday. Bail for John Sellers of the Ruckus Society, one of the main protest groups, was initially set at $1m. </p> <p>Some of the liveliest debates are expected at the shadow conventions being held near the main convention. These events, spearheaded by the journalist and former Republican supporter Arianna Huffington, will focus on poverty, drugs policy and campaign financing.</p>",
  "Campaigners for ramblers' rights today stepped up the pressure on the government not to abandon the countryside bill with a poll showing that eight out of 10 people support the legislation. <p>The Ramblers' Association published an NOP poll showing that 82% of those questioned believe the government should ensure the countryside bill, which is designed to protect threatened wildlife and the rights of ramblers, becomes law as soon as possible. </p> <p>The poll of 1,000 people follows reports last week that senior ministers are considering moves to abandon the legislation because of the massive backlog of bills which must be cleared through the Lords in this parliamentary session. </p> <p>Environmentalists fear the countryside bill, which has had more than 300 amendments from Tory peers to restrict access to their land, will be sacrificed to enable other important bills - on election spending, freedom of information, policing in Northern Ireland, criminal justice and transport - to be completed. </p> <p>But Kate Ashbrook, who has led the Ramblers' Association's right to roam campaign, said: \"The British public has consistently supported the government's election pledge to increase environmental protection and introduce a freedom to roam. It would be a tragedy if the government let this legislation fall by the wayside.\" </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Wildlife and Countryside Link, an environmental umbrella group including Friends of the Earth and the National Trust, promised to \"fight to the last hedgerow\" to get the bill passed. </p> <p>And Labour MP Gordon Prentice said it was \"inconceivable that such a popular bill could be lost\" because of a lack of parliamentary time. </p> <p>The bill has the strong backing of both the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, and the environment minister, Michael Meacher. But the pressure on the legislative timetable means that it will be difficult to steer through more than five major bills still in the upper house before the start of the next parliamentary session. </p> <p>Ministers have ensured that detailed consideration of the legislation is timetabled for early October, in the middle of the party conference season, to increase the political pressure on the Lords not to go against the public mood. </p> <p>Tory peers, backed by the Countryside Alliance, have tabled numerous amendments to restrict the land available to ramblers, and prevent night-time rambling. Landowners want ramblers to be obliged to keep dogs on leads, and compensation for damage caused by ramblers.</p>"
