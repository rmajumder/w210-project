  "Well, during 40 years in politics, I've been the warm-up man for some really class acts: Jack Jones, Barbara Castle, Neil Kinnock, John Smith, Tony Blair - and even my old mate Dennis Skinner. <p>But in all my days I've never been so proud, so happy, so honoured as to be the warm-up man for the next person coming on this stage - Nelson Mandela.</p> <p>What a week it's been! We had that bridge, sponsored by Unison. I'm not sure after yesterday's \"goings on\" whether it was a \"bridge of sighs\" or a \"bridge over troubled water\".</p> <p>And talking of the bridge, there is an announcement to make. Would the person who at the start of the week stepped in some yellow paint, please report to the standing orders committee? </p> <p>But more importantly, we've had great speeches, frank discussion, robust debate.</p> <p>This party has great ambitions, great desires for our people. But at the end of the day, it's not like opposition. When you're in government, you have to make choices and priorities. </p> <p>That's what Nye Bevan meant when he said \"the language of priorities is the religion of socialism\".</p> <p>And I want to thank all of you for your hard work throughout the year in our policy forums and discussions. </p> <p>We've had the odd disagreement this week. But don't lose sight of the huge range of policies we have determined this week.</p> <p>And wasn't that a great and inspiring speech from Tony on Tuesday - even if he was heckled by baby Leo half way through?</p> <p>Cherie and Tony are so proud of him. They can't wait to take him to his first focus group.</p> <p>And David Blunkett's been listening. David's got the message. Free nursery places for all three-year-olds. That's delivery - just in time for Leo's third birthday.</p> <p>Tony set out his vision and offered us leadership. He said it loud and clear - we have a vision worth fighting for!</p> <p>And, it will take sacrifice, effort: yes, blood; yes, tears; and, well - perhaps I'd better not mention the sweat, Tony.</p> <p>You should worry - he put his arm round me!</p> <p>Anyway, Tony's sent his suit to the cleaners. But I tell you what, at the next election we're going to take that Mr Hague to the cleaners.</p> <p>Conference, it's been 1,200 days since we were elected. And Tony and I have got the bags under our eyes to prove it.</p> <p>But Gordon's got the bags in the bank! (Only joking Gordon.) And he's not been short of advice this week on how to spend it.</p> <p>Leadership. Now, there's a lot of talk in the party about leadership.</p> <p>Yes, leadership is easier when things are going your own way. But the true test of leadership is during the harder times when you have to make difficult decisions. </p> <p>Home and abroad, Tony doesn't shirk them. In Tony Blair we've got a leader who is right up there in the top rank. Respected here, in Europe and on the world stage.</p> <p>And a man who can lead us into a second term. And Tony, no deputy could have a better leader to help him.</p> <p>So whether an election comes in six months or 18 months, we must be ready, now. Ready to put our case. Ready to go to every part of the country. Ready to go to the cities and the towns, and yes - ready to go into the villages and countryside to put Labour's case.</p> <p>Like you, I just can't wait to get stuck into those Tories. Tories? Tories? This opposition? - what a lot of chancers!</p> <p>William Hague - he gives guarantees here, guarantees there - guarantees galore. But would you believe him?</p> <p>I'd sooner take a guarantee from Del Boy than William Hague. Come to think of it. I'd have more chance of getting a remit from Rodney than a genuine guarantee from Mr Hague.</p> <p>Still, happy retirement, Rodney. The platform wishes you well. But I'm sure you will be back. After all, people said Jack Jones and Barbara Castle were going to retire. And that was 20 years ago!</p> <p>One thing's for certain, Hague's' not retiring before the election. He's getting ready. Make no mistake.</p> <p>You know, he's had another one of his weird \"bonding sessions\" for the Tory shadow cabinet. All those old Val Doonican sweaters were out again.</p> <p>During the break they had to watch William \"Bruce Lee\" Hague doing his judo with Sebastian Coe. He's still learning. He's not got a black belt or a brown belt, yet. But he's just qualified for a green belt.</p> <p>Most Tories thought a \"green belt\" was just somewhere to build a supermarket - and make a few bob. Chop and change.</p> <p>The Tories are a joke, but they are a very dangerous joke. Because of what their policies and their promises mean for people.</p> <p>The Tories. They're a party which gave us the \"common sense revolution\". A fresh start to policy, they said. It lasted three months.</p> <p>They gave us a tax guarantee - that is, to cut taxes whatever the state of the economy. That lasted one month.</p> <p>They then launched their mini-manifesto, in the summer - that lasted one week.</p> <p>They were asked time and time again, would they cut the fuel tax?</p> <p>Hague told Jimmy Young : \"I don't think we should chop and change from week to week. It's not my job to ride around on every bandwagon.\"</p> <p>Six days later, there he was, promising a tax cut, shouting, \"any more room on that bandwagon? Got room for a little one?\"</p> <p>So there we have it. \"Fourteen pints\" Billy Fizz, drunk in charge of a bandwagon.</p> <p>We all knowm, you can never trust what the Tories say. I call them the Burger Kings of British politics - every minute another whopper!</p> <p>Cheap and nasty. Not only do their policies change every day, so do their slogans.</p> <p>In the summer they had \"compassionate Conservatism\". I couldn't believe my ears. Hague, Portillo, Widdecombe, Redwood - \"compassionate Conservatives\"?</p> <p>Think about it. It's a contradiction in terms. They only have to say it, because no one believes it in the first place. In my book, \"compassion\" means consideration, caring and concern.</p> <p>Did they show any compassion when they put 3m people on the dole?</p> <p>Did they show compassion when they stopped the free eye-tests for pensioners?</p> <p>Did they show compassion when they destroyed hundreds of mining communities?</p> <p>Did they show compassion when they left people homeless, sleeping rough on the streets?</p> <p>That's not compassionate conservatism. It's callous Conservatism. </p> <p>They haven't changed. They're worse than ever. Their trademark is pandering to fear and prejudice.</p> <p>The way they talk about asylum-seekers - many of them fleeing from the horrors of war and persecution.</p> <p>The way they behaved over section 28. Abolishing section 28 isn't just about tolerance and dignity. It's about children being protected from bullying. </p> <p>It was pandering to bigotry. That's what was so disgraceful about their behaviour.</p> <p>Their latest target is doctors from overseas. I tell you, when they insult doctors and health workers from overseas, it's an insult to all public servants. An affront to all of us who use and value our national health service.</p> <p>My family doctor's Asian. I've been with him for years. I'd like to thank him and all those who helped create and serve our great national health service - from whatever land they came.</p> <p>And who made this attack? Can you believe it - it was a doctor. Dr Liam Fox, the Tory health spokesman. Liam Fox. Now you know what I think about fox-hunting. But in his case, I'd make an exception.</p> <p>So never, ever trust these Tories. Every day we're reminded of it. What about Jeffery Archer? One minute he's courting the press, the next minute he's pressed into court. </p> <p>There he is, charged with telling lies. I thought to myself, why stop there? Why not charge the whole damn lot of them for the lies they have told?</p> <p>So I say to Jack Straw, there's a case for a class action! Politics of organisation and the politics of ideas. Talking about action, you know I've always believed that the politics of organisation is as important as the politics of ideas.</p> <p>We know we can't rely on all the ladies and gentlemen of the press to get across our message. They've got their own agenda. We've got ours. And the job of everyone in this party is to set our agenda, not to feed theirs.</p> <p>People want to hear about real policies. Not the tittle tattle of years ago. So, we've got to take our message directly to the people. Face to face, on the doorstep, in the shopping centre, on the bus. </p> <p>That's the way we've always done it. And that's the way we must do it today.</p> <p>To keep on building that trust with the people, to win the battle of ideas and to win that second term we've all worked so hard for.</p> <p>Membership - conference, in that battle, we need every person we can to join our fight. Our membership is the backbone of our organisation.</p> <p>Too many of us just got out of the habit of recruiting new members. We must ask people to join the fight, to stay with us, to get involved and work with us.</p> <p>Our MPs, party staff, ordinary members are gearing up for the campaign ahead.</p> <p>I'm proud that Labour MPs on the front and back benches are playing a great part. Honing the message and delivering the message.</p> <p>And on our 100th birthday, let's just pause to pay tribute to the thousands of ordinary everyday members of this party, who give so much to this party.</p> <p>This week during conference our organisers have been making 10,000 phone calls. The night of Tony's speech, the phones were red-hot with people wanting to join the party. I want them to be red-hot every day of the week.</p> <p>Only today, I joined up a new member - our newest recruit, Duncan Worthington. Take a bow! And it's his birthday today. He's 24 years old. </p> <p>He's an accountant. So he can help us work out the \u00a324m of Tory cuts in every constituency.</p> <p>Be confident. So I say to party members, be confident. Be proud. Walk tall.</p> <p>Get out there and tell people about what we have done. Tell them what we will do , with their support. Tell them what the Tories would do if they ever came back. And remember to ask people to join the party.</p> <p>Our solidarity is our strength. Operation turnout: every one of you was handed a leaflet like this today.</p> <p>It asks you to commit yourselves to help the party in campaigning. And to recruit a friend to the party.</p> <p>Well, I say to the people watching today - come and join us again. Rejoin the fight. Write to us. Come and join us. Because we've delivered, delivered, delivered.</p> <p>But the issue is turnout, turnout, turnout.</p> <p>Conference, everyone in this hall knows what is at stake. You know what we stand for. You know what we want to achieve. You know what we promised.</p> <p>Remember our pledge card? Here it is.</p> <p>We promised a quarter of a million places on the New Deal. And we are well on the way, with 230,000 young people in jobs to date. Real people in real jobs. Promise made, promise kept.</p> <p>We promised to cut NHS waiting lists by 100,000. And we have done. But we are doing something much bigger - rebuilding the NHS. It'll mean 20,000 extra nurses, 2,000 new doctors, real staff in real hospitals. Promise made, promise kept.</p> <p>We promised to reduce class sizes for five-to-seven-year-olds. We are doing that - were already a year ahead of schedule. Standards improving day by day. Promise made, promise kept.</p> <p>On crime, we promised fast track justice for young offenders; but we have also cut crime since the election. Promise made, promise kept.</p> <p>We promised a stable economy. But we did much more than that: we achieved something magnificent. Something people said was impossible. A million new jobs in the economy. Promise made, promise kept.</p> <p>Labour is delivering. So, we've got a simple message to tell. Labour has got the economy on a steady course; which meant taking some difficult decisions. Now we are investing in our public services - hospital, schools, police, transport.</p> <p>And what's the Tory alternative? I'll tell you - \u00a316bn of Tory spending cuts. \u00a324m of cuts in every constituency.</p> <p>So, when you get to Bournemouth next week, Mr Hague, come clean about the cuts. And to help you, today we are publishing a document which shows where these cuts will fall.</p> <p>We're giving copies to every delegate so you can go back to your constituency and prepare to splatter the Tories.</p> <p>So we will ask the \u00a324m question in every constituency in the country.</p> <p>I'll tell you what it means: 30 less doctors and 60 fewer nurses; 60 fewer police officers; a school axed in every single constituency; a hospital closed in every six local authorities; 760 nursery places; and free TV licences scrapped for over 4,000 pensioners.</p> <p>And that only gets you halfway to the \u00a324m cut in every constituency. You've seen this beer mat we produced in the summer. [produces beermat and pledge card]</p> <p>\"Tory froth\" or \"Labour delivery\". That's the choice facing Britain today. We'll go to the election posing that choice.</p> <p>Remember 18 years. The Tories will be at Bournemouth next week. We don't have to guess what they would do in government. We lived with it for 18 years. And we'll never let them forget what the Tories did to our country.</p> <p>Never forget the poll tax, 3m unemployed, the betrayal of our pensioners and the health service.</p> <p>Never forget the mad cow fiasco, the water bans, the privatisation fat cats. Never forget that 22 tax rises, inflation over 10%, mortgage rates of 15%. Negative equity and repossessions. </p> <p>Never forget cash for questions; Black Wednesday; the pit closures - the sheer injustice of those Tory years. </p> <p>Remember Mrs Thatcher in 1979, standing on the steps of No 10, saying: \"Where there is discord, may we bring harmony\"? </p> <p>The real truth is, where there was harmony, she brought discord. Where there was faith, she brought doubt. Where there was hope, she brought despair.</p> <p>We'll never ever forget, and we'll never ever forgive that betrayal.</p> <p>So I say to you all inside this hall, and the wider public beyond it - in our 100th year anniversary, we can be proud of what we've achieved.</p> <p>The 20th century saw many great advances in technology. The computer, the television, a man on the moon. Even the Jaguar motor car.</p> <p>But the greatest achievement of the Labour movement was to help shape the 20th century. To combat poverty, a welfare state. To combat squalor, social housing. To combat idleness, full employment. To combat ignorance, universal education. And at the heart of it all was the national health service - based on the socialist principle of treatment on the basis of need, not the ability to pay.</p> <p>Because we believe every person is of equal worth. We believe that we achieve more by the strength of our common endeavour than we achieve alone. We believe in opportunity for all, in a community where power, wealth and opportunity are in the hands of the many, not just the few.</p> <p>We civilised the 20th century with our democratic socialist values. Now our party is taking those values into the 21st century. Putting our traditional values in a modern setting. That's our crusade for social justice. Come and join us. </p> <p>So let's stand together, let's campaign together, let's work together. Together, build that better future for all.</p> <p>[After Gabrielle sings her hit Dreams to the conference, Mr Prescott introduces the former South African president Nelson Mandela.]</p> <p>I am about to welcome to conference a man who - with his courage, his strength, his charity, his dignity, his statesmanship and his humanity has won the hearts of the world.</p> <p>You know, we spent 18 years in opposition and we hated it.</p> <p>He spent 27 years in prison and he never for one second gave up faith or hope. </p> <p>Tony spoke of his irreducible core.

  "The influential Serbian Orthodox Church has recognised Slobodan Milosevic's opponent as Yugoslavia's new president-elect, urging him to take control of the country in a peaceful way. <p>The church appealed to opposition candidate Vojislav Kostunica for restraint during a meeting of the Holy Synod, its highest body. The church holds no direct political power in Yugoslavia, but its dictates hold great moral sway in a population which recognises it as a pillar of rectitude in a corrupt society. </p> <p>It appealed to urged Kostunica and his camp to, \"take over the helm of the state, its parliament and municipalities, in as peacefully and as dignified a manner, as possible.\"</p> <p>The statement came the morning after more than 200,000 joyful anti-Milosevic demonstrators swarmed the capital's downtown district, waving banners and chanting \"He's finished.\" </p> <p>The biggest demonstration ever against Milosevic completely blocked Belgrade's main streets around Republic Square. Much of the downtown area teemed with people. </p> <p>The opposition threatened widespread civil disobedience as a means to pressure Milosevic to step down after his government released final election figures showing neither candidate won a majority - the requirement for an outright victory. </p> <p>Kostunica finished first in Sunday's elections with 48.96% to 38.62% for Milosevic, the State Election Commission said late yesterday. That would require a runoff on October 8. </p> <p>\"Milosevic cannot resort to violence... look how many people took to the streets - no one in this country has the power nor dares give orders against these people,\" Milan Protic of the opposition said. \"I believe no one in the police or army is prepared to give his life for a man who lost the elections.\" </p> <p>An opposition member of the electoral commission said that the head of the commission presented the 13 members with the results late yesterday without allowing them to inspect the returns. </p> <p>Sinisa Nikolic said 300 of the more than 10,000 polling stations never reported, and he accused the commission of reducing the overall total by 600,000 votes. </p> <p>Another opposition leader, Goran Svilanovic, said anti-Milosevic forces \"will try to avoid violence but we will persist in our effort to protect the will of the people.\" </p> <p>US President Bill Clinton and other Western leaders have dismissed talk of a runoff. \"The government's official election commission has no credibility whatever,\" Clinton said. </p> <p>The United States will move to lift economic sanctions against Yugoslavia and restore its rights as a UN member state if Kostunica is installed in Belgrade, Richard Holbrooke, the US ambassador to the United Nations, told the Security Council. </p>",
  "<p>Freeserve has laid out plans to move into internet television by signing up with Bush Internet and ONdigital's ONnet. </p> <p>The Freeserve portal has been reformatted for clearer TV viewing and will begin to be rolled out from mid-October. </p> <p>Freeserve content and services will be pre-set on Bush TVs (\u00a3169.99) and set-top boxes (\u00a379.99) sold through Dixon Group stores and supermarkets, and on the ONnet home page. </p> <p>Analysts have welcomed the move as a positive strategy, but see it as just the start of what Freeserve has to do to make inroads into the interactive TV market. </p> <p>It is still early days for Bush Internet, which has managed to sell about 200,000 boxes, but is about to discover aggressive competitors in its nascent market. </p> <p>The ONnet partnership brings access to a potential audience of only 770,000 subscribers, with limited modem speeds and possible problems with handling Freeserve content. </p> <p>Analysts are slightly disappointed by subscriber numbers - about 100,000 short of forecasts - but are encouraged by portal usage, with 186.2m page impressions in August. The total number of subscribers now stands at 2.1m.</p> <p>The unmetered access offer has gained a strong following, with more than 250,000 subscribers now using the service. However, the results indicate that take-up of unmetered access has come from existing users rather than completely new Freeserve users. </p>",
  "In a scruffy radio studio full of old cigarette smoke, Tamara Skroza is pumping the air with her fists beside a full ashtray. She is singing along with the first disc of her show - a song from Sarajevo about an old football player who is finally saying goodbye. <p>Ms Skroza, 27, is one of the stars of Radio Index, a young and irreverent student station that has somehow survived Slobodan Milosevic's censorship police and caught the heartbeat of Belgrade. </p> <p>Dozens of callers, filled with rage, hurt and humour have gone on air in the last two days to call on Mr Milosevic to stand down after he polled well behind his rival in the elections. </p> <p>Among these callers is an elderly woman who says: \"I have to admit I voted for Slobodan Milosevic - but now that he has lost he has to respect the will of the people.\" </p> <p>Radio Index having become the voice of the election, Ms Skroza is talking to almost a million people in the capital. </p> <p>Her show starts - as always - with a recording of the tired hoarse voice of the president telling a party rally to beware the oppostion of \"rats, hyenas and foxes that want our nation to crawl like poodles to the west\". </p> <p>Today, her show is about the Yugoslav president's attempt to survive by staging a second round in the presidential election that the opposition contends he has already lost. </p> <p>\"We expected the worst possible elections,\" she says. \"Instead of that, hope was born and Serbia was laughing. Then somebody made the decision that Serbia mustn't laugh and mustn't hope. Is that someone afraid now that our spiritually destroyed nation has somehow come back to life?\" </p> <p>Mr Milosevic and his wife and political partner, Mira Markovic, are not, for now, going anywhere, though thousand were expected on the streets of Belgrade last night for a concert calling on him to step down. There are no pictures of the growing protest concerts on state TV or radio, and no mention of street demonstrations. </p> <p>Several stations have been shut in recent weeks, and others forced to move. Those still operating have been told to play only music. Policemen camp in their offices. </p> <p>Ms Skroza had told her listeners that she would shave her head and pierce her nose if Mr Milosevic won. So far, she has only dyed her hair. \"I feel so happy, so full of energy. I week ago I felt 100 years old. A lot of people have that new energy and he can't beat that out of us.\" </p> <p>Ms Skroza got distracted from a fine-art degree and joined Radio Index. Until recently the station was so short of funds that when the heating broke, listeners came in to donate heaters. </p> <p>The station's equivalent of traffic news is to give information on where the police have cordoned off streets and which junctions to avoid because of the risk of confrontation with the police. </p> <p>\"I got into this radio business because I needed to speak. I never voted for him [Milosevic] but he has made my last 13 years an indescribable hell. My mother was hypnotised by him and I can probably never forgive her for that.\" </p> <p>Ms Skroza travelled 250 miles to her mother's home town on Sunday to be able to vote, and one of her friends flew back from Hamburg for one night so that he could cast his ballot. </p> <p>\"Many people are voting for the first time. I was 14 when he came to power. I don't feel responsible for what he did\". </p> <p>She flicks another cigarette into the ashtray and closes her show with a song from the 1997 winter of protest, Step by Step. </p> <p>Its chorus goes: \"We are united by the same motive now. I am looking for a new time. My new self.\"</p>",
  "Thousands of opposition supporters brandishing leaflets that proclaimed the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, was \"broken like a baby's rattle\" poured into Belgrade city centre last night in a trial of strength over Sunday's disputed election. <p>On the fourth consecutive night of burgeoning demonstrations, protesters were ordered by police to dismantle a stage outside the headquarters of the Federal Election Commission, but immediately regrouped nearby. </p> <p>Final results in the presidential race are expected to be announced tonight. But since Mr Milosevic controls the Federal Electoral Commission, they are widely expected to be fixed. </p> <p>Mr Milosevic's camp has claimed that the main opposition candidate, Vojislav Kostunica, won the first round of the election but failed to gain 50% needed for outright victory. </p> <p>As people began coming on to the streets shortly after 5pm yesterday in preparation for a rally at 8pm, no one appeared to be contemplating the option of participating in a second round. The proposal put forward by Mr Milosevic was rejected by Mr Kostunica, a 56-year-old lawyer. </p> <p>For three days, domestic and international pleas for Mr Milosevic to step down have been ignored. </p> <p>President Bill Clinton yesterday accused him of trying to steal the election from the opposition and said the United States would support the people of Serbia. </p> <p>\"It certainly appears from a distance that they had a free election and somebody is trying to take it away from them,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Milosevic was indicted by the International War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague and has few options if he is forced to step down. There is also a $5m (\u00a33m) bounty on offer from the US government for his capture leading to prosecution by the Hague. </p> <p>There were concerns that Mr Milosevic would try to use the paramilitary police to break up the rally last night. Before the rally began, a few dozen policemen were wandering around the city centre with their hands in their pockets. </p> <p>The opposition leaders are concerned to avoid any violence and fear provocations by the regime. \"Our stand is to avoid any conflict; we are the winners and we do not need conflicts,\" said Zoran Djindjic, an opposition leader. </p> <p>Student activists warned that government provocateurs dressed in protesters' T-shirts might stir up trouble at the rally. They said police had confiscated 4,000 T-shirts - marked with a clenched fist, the symbol of the Otpor movement. Otpor means resistance in Serbian. </p> <p>\"We wish to warn that we are not responsible for that because our methods are non-violent,\" Otpor activist Vukasin Petrovic said. </p> <p>\"We're just ignoring him now. It's a new psychological phenomenon that I have never seen before,\" said Mr Petrovic, a 32-year-old architect. </p> <p>\"He can do whatever he wants. He can say he's king of the earth - but nobody cares.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, former allies of Mr Milosevic are preparing to jump ship, and threatening to abandon their coalition with him in the Serbian parliament. Vojislav Seselj, leader of the extremist Radical Party, is considering the move that would mean the fall of the Milosevic government. </p> <p>Scenting blood, Mr Seselj's nationalist extremists, whose men provided some of shock troops for Mr Milosevic's \"ethnic cleansing\" campaigns in Bosnia and Kosovo, are abandoning him. </p> <p>Another former ally, Vuk Draskovic, is also paying the price for refusing the join the united front against Milosevic. After a devastating defeat for his party, the Serbian Renewal Movement - he went public two days ago and said that he was wrong not to back opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica's bid to become president. </p> <p>Mr Milosevic's government is still in denial. The media he controls does not know how to react. </p> <p>On the front page of Politika, the only picture at this momentous crossroads in Serbia's history was one of the designer, Karl Lagerfeld, who is involved in a tax scandal in France. </p> <p>The front page, is still insisting that Mr Milosevic's party, the Socialist Party of Serbia, and his wife's party, Yugoslav Left, are going to form the next federal government. </p> <p>But two government television stations, BK television and Studio B yesterday surprised viewers with extensive reports from the opposition press conference, where it was announced that Mr Milosevic had lost the election. For the first time, it appears that Mr Milosevic is even beginning to lose control of one of his most powerful weapons.</p>",
  "Serbian opposition representatives were rebuffed yesterday when they tried to see the ballot records on which federal election commission officials based their claim that Vojislav Kostunica failed to win enough votes for a first-round victory over President Slobodan Milosevic in Sunday's poll. <p>\"As I had expected, they did not ... allow us, and nor will they, to look into the election material,\" Nebojsa Bakarec said after speaking to officials inside the parliament building where the commission works. </p> <p>\"There is great fear among the commission,\" he added. He was the only member of the 40-strong team allowed in. He later appealed to commission members to \"publish the real results and act according to their conscience, without creating tensions\". </p> <p>The commission's rebuff only served to add conviction to the opposition's belief that it won the election outright. Cedomir Jovanovic, the spokesman for the 18-party Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) said that, with 97% of the votes counted, Mr Kostunica had won 52%. </p> <p>The credibility of its figures was reinforced by the ultra-right Radical party, which had its own presidential candidate and is still nominally part of Mr Milosevic's government. Its figures tally. </p> <p>The opposition's confidence in rejecting a runoff is based on several factors, analysts in Belgrade said. They range from a determination to retain the initiative in the battle of wills with an increasingly desperate Mr Milosevic, to a sense that the federal election commission will soon \"crack\" and be forced to give new figures showing that the opposition did indeed win. </p> <p>There are also signs that the police will not dare to beat peaceful protesters; that the army is uncertain of its conscripts' loyalty; that Mr Milosevic has lost the support of his best ally, Russia; and that his more pragmatic advisers are saying that he still could have a political future in Serbia as an ex-president. </p> <p>\"They may well be telling him that Vojislav Kostunica is a nationalist who has repeatedly said that he does not accept the international war crimes tribunal in the Hague. They could also remind him that he can stay on as leader of the Socialist party of Serbia,\" said Sasha Nenadovic, former editor of a leading Belgrade newspaper. </p> <p>The most optimistic scenario canvassed by Belgrade observers was that the election commission would give different results when it releases the final count this evening. It is known to have held back about 500,000 votes which have allegedly not yet been counted. This could allow it to declare that Mr Kostunica did get more than 50% of the vote, thereby making him president without a runoff. </p> <p>The very fact that the commission has already conceded an eight-point lead to Mr Kostunica was being seen as historic in Belgrade. </p> <p>Mr Milosevic has frequently turned to force to try to handle problems. His record of bloodshed is strewn across the Balkans. But he has also retreated when the odds were overwhelming. </p> <p>Nato's intervention last year ended after 78 days when Mr Milosevic finally found too many factors were building up against him. </p> <p>Similar realism could prevail again, the DOS leadership hopes. Strengthening the argument that the commission may have to concede victory for Mr Kostunica are its own official figures for the elections to councils in Serbia as well as the federal parliament. </p> <p>These show that the DOS had an almost clean sweep of the poll at the local level. It won a staggering 105 of the 110 seats on the Belgrade city council, virtually wiping out Mr Milosevic's Socialist party, which won only four seats, as well as the Radical party of Vojislav Seselj, which took one. </p> <p>Vuk Draskovic's Serbian Renewal Movement, which once ran Belgrade's city government, failed to win a seat. Several ministers from Mr Milosevic's socialists lost their council seats. </p> <p>The overwhelming switch to the opposition was repeated across Serbia. DOS won councils in almost every major town. Mr Seselj lost his seat in his home suburb. </p> <p>The only good news for Mr Milosevic came as a result of the boycott of the election in Montenegro, organised by the government of Milo Djukanovic. This allowed the pro-Milosevic party to win almost all the seats from Montenegro, leaving the embattled Yugoslav president in control of both houses of the federal parliament. </p> <p>DOS says it also defeated Mr Milosevic in many army bar racks where conscripts voted. The message will not be lost on officers who will have to think hard before ordering the army to break up street protests. </p> <p>Mr Milosevic's continuing control over the federal parliament still leaves him with a few cards. He also controls the government and presidency of Serbia through committed loyalists. </p> <p>These two factors might allow him to negotiate his future with Mr Kostunica, getting a guarantee of his personal security as head of the Socialist party in return for working with the new president.</p>",
  "In American elections, just as in the US constitution, all voters are created equal - but those who vote in the handful of battleground states are more equal than the others. <p>The contest between George W Bush and Al Gore on November 7 will be decided by a handful of votes in a body called the electoral college. The presidency is settled not by a national tally of Bush voters against Gore voters - the \"popular vote\" - but in a state-by-state contest in which the winner in each state collects all of that state's votes in the electoral college. </p> <p>The number of votes each state casts in the electoral college is equal to its members in the US House of Representatives and the Senate combined. Since a state's representation in the house is based on its population, while each state has two senators, California has the most electoral college votes, with 54, while seven small states and the District of Columbia each have just three. </p> <p>There are 538 members of the electoral college, therefore 270 electoral college votes are required to win the presidency. </p> <p>The effect of the electoral college is brutal, especially for voters in smaller states. The big states matter most because they have most electoral college votes, and the big swing states matter most of all, especially in an electoral race as close as this year's. </p> <p>California and New York, with 87 votes between them, are both leaning towards Mr Gore. In all, the Associated Press's senior analyst Ron Fournier estimates, 15 states and the District of Columbia, worth 224 electoral college votes between them, are likely to go for Mr Gore, while Mr Bush looks to have 21 states worth 171 votes. </p> <p>This leaves 14 swing states, in which the election is likely to be decided, with 143 electoral college votes in all. </p> <p>The majority of the most important states in this group are, as so often in the past, in the midwest, led by Ohio (21 votes), Michigan (18), Missouri (11) and Wisconsin (11). </p> <p>But the battleground is not confined to the midwest: States such as Washington (11 votes) and - the most intriguing of all - Florida (25) also remain very much up for grabs. </p> <p>Expect these states to get the lion's share of the campaign time and money between now and November 7. Mr Gore, for instance, is said privately to have made his last visit to California, so confident is he of victory there. Mr Bush, on the other hand, still faces the difficult decision of whether to spend valuable time and money in California between now and November. Republican candidates running for other offices there want him to fly the party flag in the state, but every day Mr Bush spends in California is a day not spent in the battleground states. </p> <p>Although the presidency grabs most of the media attention, the elections on November 7 are not just about the White House. The whole 435-member House of Representatives is up for election, as it is every two years, while 34 seats in the 100-member Senate and 11 state governorships are also being contested. </p> <p>The most important battle is for control of the house, where Republicans hold an 11-vote majority. If Mr Gore wins the presidency and the Democrats retake the house under Dick Gephardt, the domestic legislative consequences would be enormous - as would the soul-searching among the Republicans.</p>",
  "Ohio lies at the heart of a nation still wavering over who it wants to be president. In fact, if there was a meridian of indecision running through the country, it would bisect this swing state, through Montgomery, its most evenly balanced county, down the middle of Dayton and under the feet of Felix Garfunkel. <p>Mr Garfunkel's vote, like the state of Ohio, is up for grabs. And with 40 days until the US goes to the polls, his opinions - and those of his fellow floating Daytonians - could prove decisive. Historically, the candidate who wins Montgomery county usually wins Ohio, and the winner in Ohio almost always wins the presidency. </p> <p>Mr Garfunkel, out shopping in the aptly named Dayton suburb of Centerville, is having a hard time deciding. </p> <p>\"I'm waiting for the debates to make up my mind,\" he says. \"I will see what the positions of the two are. Gore has promised a lot, but those things have yet to be proved. But Bush hasn't given details of what he thinks either.\" </p> <p>Mr Bush's lead in the state has narrowed to 4%, which is virtually insignificant, statistically speaking. In Dayton and the surrounding Montgomery county, the two candidates are running neck and neck with the support of 49% of likely voters apiece. Dayton's decision could be critical in determining the allocation of Ohio's precious 21 votes in the electoral college, which formally decides the presidency. </p> <p>Mr Garfunkel is 69 years old and shares the concerns of his fellow pensioners about the ballooning cost of prescription medicines and the fate of the state-funded Medicare system. But he admits he does not have a clear idea of either candidate's plans. </p> <p>Mark Taylor, 45, a respiratory therapist at a Dayton hospital is in the same boat. \"To be honest, there's not an easy answer,\" he says. \"I'm not real happy with either side. I'm not happy with the whole concept of politics. I think as far as the economy is concerned it's going a little bit easier on us. But I'm not sure if that has anything to do with Mr Gore.\" </p> <p>Ralph Nader, the environmentalist contender, is a man of real integrity, the Centerville voter believes, but as he is not going to win, what is the point? </p> <p>Other shoppers have more concrete views. Most of the white, middle-class residents are long-term Republicans who say they are still sickened by the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal, and angry with the vice-president for not resigning in disgust. Most of the black Daytonians are traditional Democrats whose party loyalty was set in stone 40 years ago, in the civil rights struggle. </p> <p>There is no reason to believe that the range of views in Centerville is very different from anywhere else in the great undecided heartland. It certainly looks like a thousand other quietly prosperous suburbs around the country. Regional unemployment - at 4% - is at a post-war low. The shopping malls are full and most of the cars parked along the shaded streets seem to have been bought in the last five years. </p> <p>In Dayton, a city of about 180,000, the scars of de-industrialisation are visible - empty sites where cars were once assembled for General Motors, whose jobs have gone to cheaper labour in Mexico and Asia. But those scars are being quickly smoothed over. The sleek offices of hi-tech companies have transformed the outskirts of town. </p> <p>\"There is a sense of contentment and a general lack of commitment,\" Jim Walker, a politics professor at Dayton's Wright State University, says. \"You will normally get a third partisan Republicans, a third Democrats and a third who just don't pay any attention. Ohio perhaps has more of those. I've found about 42 or 43% who just don't identify. That mostly means they don't pay attention.\" </p> <p>Prof Walker argues that the usual neat profile of a swing voter - someone carefully weighing their interests and options in the light of the party platforms - is a false one. Confusion, ignorance of the issues and disinterest are far more common. </p> <p>Certainly, the opinions expressed in Centerville appeared to be based on gut feeling rather than careful calculation. \"With many people\", Prof Walker says, \"the last good idea they hear will be the one they go for.\" </p> <p>The candidates have visited Ohio about a dozen times since the August conventions, and will visit another dozen times before the election, in the hope of providing that decisive \"good idea\". </p> <p>During a visit last week, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, Joe Lieberman, told a crowd of supporters: \"If the Gore-Lieberman ticket carries Ohio, that's it folks - the other side doesn't have a chance. </p> <p>\"I'm not trying to put pressure on you but the future of America is on your shoulders.\"</p>",
  "President Jacques Chirac was under heavy pressure yesterday to call a truce in a potentially catastrophic feud with Lionel Jospin, his socialist prime minister, by coming clean about past covert funding operations. <p>Amid growing calls for snap presidential and general elections, Patrick Devedjian, a close adviser to the president and spokesman for Mr Chirac's conservative RPR party, said the president should admit publicly that all political parties used to have illegal slush funds. This ended after the early 1990s, he maintained. </p> <p>Mr Devedjian hopes to shut the door on a cupboard positively stuffed with skeletons, and his words were echoed yesterday by those of another leading conservative, Philippe S\u00e9guin. \"We have to stop the games we're playing,\" he said. </p> <p>The president has consistently referred to all the accusations as \"utterly without foundation\", but even in his own party few now seem to believe he can maintain this approach. </p> <p>Mr Devedjian's call for openness came after several days of mudslinging prompted by the videotaped confession of an RPR official, now dead, directly implicating Mr Chirac in a vast party financing scam while he was mayor of Paris from 1977-95. </p> <p>MPs and commentators were already referring to the Chirac scandal as worthy of a banana republic when it expanded to embroil the socialists earlier this week. It emerged that their former finance minister, the disgraced Dominique Strauss-Kahn, had a copy of the video - but had not told Mr Jospin or magistrates investigating the RPR's financing. </p> <p>The RPR immediately accused the socialists of political manipulation, or even fabrication. Mr Strauss-Kahn, it was alleged, got the tape from a lawyer for granting a massive tax break to the couturier Karl Lagerfeld. The former minister, now under investigation, strenuously denies this. </p> <p>\"If the president were to close the chapter on the past it would be a healthy step for everyone, for our democracy, for a country of our standing,\" Mr Devedjian said. He said Mr Chirac should \"state publicly that everybody, including the RPR of course, raised funds illegally\", so that French politics could finally move on. </p> <p>\"We are the fourth largest power in the world and we are reduced to holding debates that are totally humiliating and degrading for all politicians and for our democracy,\" Mr Devedjian declared. </p> <p>The public Chirac-Jospin struggle comes at a time when France is in charge of complex talks on the future of the EU. After three years of polite if strained \"cohabitation\", the two leaders have every interest in abandoning a battle that would ruin them on the domestic and international stages </p> <p>Mr Jospin has already sought to calm his more virulent supporters, including the head of the socialist group in the national assembly, Jean-Marc Ayrault, who accused Mr Chirac of being a \"demagogic populist\" who was dragging French politics down and would be facing prosecution were he not covered by presidential immunity. </p> <p>\"My conception of public life has led me not to make use of scandals in political debate,\" the prime minister said on Tuesday night, before adding: \"But that does not mean we should allow ourselves to be intimidated, or to be accused collectively of crimes we have not committed.\" </p> <p>Newspaper editorials have started to call for presidential and general elections to be called much earlier than when they fall due in 2002. And an opinion poll shows that 70% of respondents want Mr Chirac to volunteer for questioning by investigators. </p> <p>\"Only a presidential election and the resignation of the government would relieve our disgust,\" said the L'Express weekly, while Ouest France said that \"everything, whether we like it or not, is happening as if we had started to plan for an early election once the French presidency of the European Union is over [at the end of December.]\" </p> <p>Allegations of underhand financial dealings at the Paris town hall when Mr Chirac was mayor are now so commonplace that most voters are readily prepared to believe the videotape. </p> <p>The investigators have also found letters that seem to corroborate the tape, adding to suspicions that the president is not telling the truth. </p> <p><b>Wages of power</b></p> <p><b> Kickbacks </b><br> Under investigation are some 60 politicians and businessmen - the Paris mayor, Jean Tiberi, among them - suspected of involvement in kickbacks from building firms seeking council contracts in the capital, run for 18 years by Jacques Chirac of the centre-right RPR </p> <p><b> Payroll scams</b><br> The former RPR prime minister, Alain Jupp\u00e9, and three former RPR treasurers are being investigation on suspicion that as many as 300 party activists were given fictitious jobs at the town hall or with friendly construction firms </p> <p><b> Influence peddling</b><br> Xavier Dugoin, a former RPR official, has been sentenced to 18 months in prison for paying \u00a320,000 to Mr Tiberi's wife Xavi\u00e8re for a 36-page report largely copied from a textbook. Mrs Tiberi's case was annulled on technicalities but will be retried in November </p> <p><b> Election fraud </b><br> The Tiberi clan under investigation is suspected of filling electoral rolls in Tiberi's Paris constituency with thousands of non-resident pro-RPR voters </p> <p><b> Elf scandal</b><br> Twenty people are under judicial investigation on suspicion of bribery and embezzlement - dating back to Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's socialist presidency in the early 90s - involving the oil company Elf. The suspects include ex-foreign minister Roland Dumas, his mistress Christine Deviers-Joncours, Elf's former president Loik Le Floch-Prigent and a number of senior executives</p>",
  "Last week George W Bush surged back after languishing in Al Gore's shadow ever since the Democratic national convention in mid-August. His gains came as memories of Mr Gore's excellent acceptance speech began to fade and the vice-president seemed to trip over his feet every day. <p>Mr Gore has a problem with telling the truth. His embellishments, exaggerations and enhancements of reality only lead to embarrassments. </p> <p>First came his claim to have \"invented\" the internet (he only backed legislation which helped make its funding possible). He said that he and his wife Tipper were the model for the movie Love Story (his college classmate wrote it but denied that it was about Mr Gore). He maintained that he discovered the massive pollution at Love Canal in New York state (he held a hearing about it but only after it was already uncovered by others). </p> <p>Last week, Mr Gore's mouth really roared. He said that he had created the strategic petroleum reserve - the oil America saves for a rainy day. He didn't. He wasn't in Congress until two years after it was established. He said that the popular labour union song Look for the Union Label was his childhood lullaby. Unfortunately, it turned out he was 27 when it was composed. </p> <p>To cap it all off, he claimed that his mother-in-law paid more for her arthritis medicine than she had to pay for identical medicine for the family dog. But the example was hypothetical, not real, and based on a congressional study, not on personal experience. </p> <p>Oh well. </p> <p>In a campaign that has, so far, lacked issues, these examples of Mr Gore's verbal laxity have cut deeply into the vice-president's image. </p> <p>But now, at long last, Mr Gore may have found an issue to use to regain the lead - maintaining the Medicare programme which provides health care to the elderly. </p> <p>Medicare is a sacred cow in US politics. Former house speaker Newt Gingrich was doing fine in his slashing of government programmes until he proposed cutting the programme's benefits and increasing premiums. </p> <p>Mr Clinton seized the issue and used it to beat Mr Gingrich and get re-elected in the process. </p> <p>Taking his cue from his mentor in the White House, Mr Gore has proposed spending $600bn (\u00a3400bn) over the next decade to assure the solvency of the Medicare programme. But Mr Bush is so anxious for a major tax cut that he only proposes to set aside barely $150bn for Medicare. </p> <p>This week, Mr Gore is pounding Mr Bush over Medicare. It will pay off big time. Polls show that voters are deeply concerned about Medicare and do not expect it to survive without a healthy infusion of new revenues. More importantly, the Republican party is suspect on the issue because of its past efforts to cut the programme. </p> <p>Instead of allocating funds to fix Medicare, Mr Bush proposes a tax cut of $1,300bn during the next 10 years, while Mr Gore confines his generosity to a mere $500bn over the same period. Polling shows that voters would gladly accept a smaller tax cut in return for knowing that their medical needs will be met in the future. </p> <p>Mr Gore will begin to talk about the Medicare issue this week. As he develops traction over his differences with Mr Bush, look for him to use the issue to great effect in the first debate between the two candidates on October 3. </p> <p>Mr Bush, who should see Mr Gore's punch coming, has done nothing to block it. While the Republican nominee successfully defused Mr Gore's proposal to expand Medicare to cover prescription drugs for the elderly by matching it with his own initiative, he has left himself wide open on the preservation of Medicare itself. </p> <p>Mr Bush is more popular than Mr Gore. If there are no issues, Mr Bush will win. But if Mr Gore can use the Medicare issue to open big differences with the Republican nominee, he can use the issue to win the debates and win the election. </p> <p>Provided he offers no more helpful elaborations of his biography and does not claim to have been the first man on the moon. </p> <p>\u0095 Dick Morris was chief strategist for President Bill Clinton in his successful 1996 re-election campaign.
