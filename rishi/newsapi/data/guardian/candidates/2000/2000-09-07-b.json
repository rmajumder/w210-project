  "<p>George W Bush's presidential campaign has received a much-needed boost with the news that his advisers have signed an agreement with striking US actors' unions that will allow him to use their actors in radio and television advertisements.</p> <p>Unions representing 135,000 actors have for the past four months been refusing to take part in any radio or TV ads because of plans by advertisers to change the way they are paid. </p> <p>At present, actors in commercials receive residuals, which means they are paid each time the ad appears. The advertisers want to replace this with a flat rate of $2,575 (\u00a31,770) for using an actor in commercials over a three-month cycle. The advertisers claim this will benefit the actors.</p> <p>The strike has attracted international publicity, most notably when high-profile celebrities including Liz Hurley and Tiger Woods were branded strike breakers. Hurley pleaded ignorance of the strike when she attracted criticism for making an ad for Est\u008ee Lauder.</p> <p>The unions are hailing the Bush agreement as a victory, saying that it proves professional actors are a key component of successful campaign strategies. Under the terms of the agreement, advertisers can use union actors to produce commercials under the unions' terms. </p> <p>Vice-president Al Gore's campaign signed the agreement during the first few days of the strike.</p>",
  "Al Gore launched what he hopes will be a decisive strike against the tax-cutting proposals of his presidential election rival George W Bush yesterday, when he offered millions of low and middle income Americans a boost to their wealth while promising to safeguard state funding for social services. <p>In a keynote speech in Cleveland which established the most striking contrast to date in the positions of the two main candidates, Mr Gore set out an economic stall based on redistributing the fruits of America's hi-tech economic boom rather than on large tax cuts preferred by Mr Bush. </p> <p>\"My plan wasn't built on the cross-your-fingers economics that says we can give more to the people who already have the most and then just hope the benefits trickle down to the middle-class,\" Mr Gore said. </p> <p>With the polls already moving in his favour in the past three weeks, Mr Gore clearly intended his speech - and a 190-page budget plan which he also released yesterday - to deliver a hammer blow against Republican hopes of recapturing the White House in November. </p> <p>Mr Bush's economic plans, which centre on tax cuts, would leave America $2.8 trillion in debt by 2012, Mr Gore alleged. The Bush plan \"gives most to those who need it the least, and the least to those who need it the most - and that's just wrong,\" Mr Gore said. </p> <p>Mr Gore's economic agenda is aimed at raising the income of families on average earnings - currently just under $50,000 a year [\u00a333,000] - by a third in real terms over a decade and to double the number of families with savings in excess of $50,000. </p> <p>Mr Gore also promised that the gap between the earnings of men and women, currently 27 cents in the dollar, would be halved by 2010, and that the percentage of Americans who are defined as living in poverty would fall below 10% for the first time in the nation's history. </p> <p>Mr Gore also promised to oversee the creation of 10m \"high quality, hi-tech, high-skill jobs\" in a decade, to raise the numbers of US college students by 75% by making tuition fees tax deductible, and to expand home ownership to a record level of 70% of all families. </p> <p>Alongside these eye-catching pledges, Mr Gore simultaneously committed himself to reduce income tax by 2002 on the typical American family to its lowest level since the second world war. </p> <p>But perhaps the strongest evidence of the political and economic \"win-win\" opportunity which Mr Gore set out in his speech were a series of fiscally conservative public spending pledges that earlier Democrats never had the luxury to offer. </p> <p>Mr Gore told his audience at Cleveland State University that he would continue to balance the US federal budget each year, and committed him self to eliminate the entire federal deficit by 2012. Every dollar that was already pledged to the federal social security pension fund and to the Medicare programme for the elderly would be \"lockboxed\", he promised. </p> <p>And in a further pledge of fiscal caution Mr Gore said he would put a sixth of the federal budget surplus each year into a new federal reserve fund \"for a rainy day\". </p> <p>\"We will underspend the surplus rather than over-promise our way into an economic hole,\" Mr Gore said, offering a pledge which strategists believe will be especially popular with women voters, who tend to prefer fiscal caution more readily than men. </p> <p>\"If today's economic forecasts fall short, this new reserve fund will guarantee that we will not have to cut education or health care,\" Mr Gore pledged. </p> <p>\"The Gore-Lieberman eco nomic plan has one guiding purpose: to help the middle- class families who have always been America's purpose and its pride,\" Mr Gore said. </p> <p>\"No blank cheques. No deficit spending. Tax cuts for the middle class instead of a tax giveaway for those who need it least,\" he said.</p>",
  "Problems with North Korea, Iraq and a series of other disputes overshadowed the UN millennium summit in New York. <p>The US president, Bill Clinton, listed them in his speech to the summit: the Middle East, Sierra Leone, Iraq, Yugoslavia.</p> <p>He singled out the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, as one of the worst offenders in the international community in the past 10 years.</p> <p>Addressing the summit, the prime minister, Tony Blair, referred to the \"dismal failure of the world in Africa\". He called for an overhaul of UN peacekeeping operations and a new partnership with the continent to end its wars and poverty.</p> <p>\"We should use this unique summit for a concrete purpose: to start the process of agreeing a way forward for Africa,\" he said.</p> <p>He also proposed that UN states should enter into a contract with the organisation to quickly provide able soldiers to respond to crises wherever they arise.</p> <p>The rhetoric at the summit is idealistic, talking about reform of the UN, but on the sidelines Mr Clinton and other leaders are holding one-to-one talks on grittier issues.</p> <p>They include discussion with the leaders from the Balkans on what response should be made if Mr Milosevic stirs up trouble before the presidential election later this month.</p> <p>Even before the summit began, there was a diplomatic incident with North Korea, which has been engaged in improving its relations with the wider world community. Its delegates to the summit suffered the indignity of being strip-searched before boarding an American plane at Frankfurt, and returned home in protest.</p> <p>Discussions are going on behind the scenes about finding a way out of the morass with Iraq. The Iraqi foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, is being treated as a pariah by most of the other delegates. Iraq is reluctant to allow a UN weapons inspection team in to check that it is not developing weapons of mass destruction.</p> <p>The Cyprus dispute has long ceased to arouse much public interest, but the UN is hopeful that a settlement is possible and another round of talks is to be held next week.</p> <p>Delegates slope off for one-to-one talks in pre-booked rooms near the hall. Mr Blair, had talks with his counterparts from Chile, Albania, Montenegro, Palestine, Germany and France.</p> <p>The most significant talks were those between Mr Clinton and the Palestine Authority president, Yasser Arafat, and the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, in an effort to secure another round of Middle East talks.</p> <p>Mr Clinton is desperate to leave a Middle East peace settlement as his personal achievement.</p> <p>The main legacy of the summit will be the conference's adoption of an internal UN report recommending the establishment of a permanent high command for the peacekeeping operations.</p> <p>But the UN remains seriously under-resourced. It is also weakened by the continuing veto held by the five security council permanent members: Britain, France, the US, China and Russia.</p> <p>In spite of a British proposal this week to expand the membership, the security council meeting today will not address fundamental reform but instead concentrate on current issues, such as the sanctions imposed on Iraq.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Bob Roberts</strong><br>(Tim Robbins, 1992)<br>8pm, FilmFour </p> <p>Robbins directs and stars here as a rightwing folk singer turned would-be senator who is adept at hitting all the right notes with an undiscriminating electorate. And the satirical message is wittily drummed in: politics is all about entertaining the masses - and those who don't, like Gore Vidal's rather more decent Democratic candidate, are out of time. There's an eminently watchable cast, including Alan Rickman, Susan Sarandon and James Spader, all of whom help to keep up the tempo. </p> <p><strong>There's Something About Mary</strong><br>(Peter and Bobby Farrelly, 1998)<br>8pm, Sky Premier </p> <p>Poor geeky Ben Stiller. The girl of his dreams (Cameron Diaz) is taking him to the high school ball - until a nasty accident with his zipper ends the romance before it starts. Years later he employs Matt Dillon's sleazy private eye to track her down, but Dillon starts making moves on her himself. Add the shocking-the-dog-back-to-life sketch and famous sperm-hair-gel scene, and it's clear that questions of taste are far from the Farrellys' minds. The funny thing is, it's so funny. </p> <p><strong> Crazy People</strong><br>(Tony Bill, 1990)<br>12.55am, Sky Cinema </p> <p>A comic swipe at the honourable profession of advertising. Dudley Moore, standing in for first choice John Malkovich, plays an ad-man who starts writing the truth (shock, horror) about his products and is, of course, carted off to the asylum, where he galvanises fellow patients, including Daryl Hannah. All a bit obvious, but charming. </p> <p><strong> The Killing Fields</strong><br>(Roland Joffe, 1984)<br>1.55am, FilmFour </p> <p>Emotionally charged vision of war based on real events, with Sam Waterston as American journalist Sydney Schanberg tracing the guide Dith Pran (Haing S Ngor) he was forced to leave to the tender mercies of the Khmer Rouge.</p>",
  "Bill Clinton placed the future of the United States' controversial national missile defence (NMD) plans squarely in the hands of voters when he said that he was leaving the decision on whether to go ahead to his successor. <p>President Clinton was bowing to the combined weight of domestic and international pressure as well as to evidence that the proposed missile interceptor system does not yet work. His decision now places a major international issue at the heart of November's presidential election. </p> <p>\"I simply cannot conclude, with the information I have today, that we have enough confidence in the technology and the operational effectiveness of the entire NMD system to move forward to deployment,\" Mr Clinton said in a hastily arranged speech at Georgetown University, Washington, on Friday last week. </p> <p>He had intended to make a decision in the light of recent interceptor tests in the Pacific. But the failure of two of the last three experiments, and the approaching election, left him with little alternative but to postpone. </p> <p>The speech, added to Mr Clinton's schedule at the last possible moment, allowed him to dispose of the issue before the opening this week of the United Nations' millennium summit, in which the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and other leaders were expected to denounce him over the missile defence programme. </p> <p>His decision was greeted with relief in European capitals. The project had threatened to provoke unprecedented cracks in Nato. The alliance's secretary-general, Lord Robertson, said: \"The decision . . . to continue testing and development of a limited national missile defence system, while reserving judgment on eventual deployment, appears to be a prudent course of action that balances the many factors involved in this issue.\" </p> <p>The US plan has special significance for Britain as it would involve upgrading the early warning station at Fylingdales, on the North York Moors, and the construction of a new large radar base at another, as yet unidentified, site in Britain. </p> <p>The system being tested would involve the deployment of 100 missile interceptors in Alaska, starting in 2005. The president's announcement means that the US will not now begin preparing an NMD radar ground station in the Aleutian Islands, west of the Alaskan mainland, next spring. </p> <p>Mr Clinton wrapped his decision in a carefully drafted reassertion of the case for national missile defences, and said his decision would still allow the US to deploy a system by \"about 2006 or 2007\". </p> <p>But he also made it clear that his decision gave his successor time to make a better job of persuading international opinion, especially Russia, of the case for a system that would infringe the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. </p> <p>Mr Clinton said the ABM treaty remained \"a key part of the international security structure we have built with Russia, and therefore a key part of our national security\". </p> <p>The Republican presidential candidate, George W Bush, said last week that he intends \"to develop and deploy an effective missile defence system at the earliest possible date\". He also said he intends to extend the Clinton administration's system, which seeks to protect only the US, to Europe and the Middle East. </p> <p>The Democratic candidate, Al Gore, said he welcomed \"the opportunity to be more certain that these technologies actually work together properly\". The decision allowed \"more clarity about the costs of the system\" - estimated at $60bn - as well as \"time to conduct updated discussions with other countries\". </p> <p>\"As president, I would oppose the kinds of missile defence systems that would unnecessarily upset strategic stability and threaten to open the gates for a renewed arms race with Russia and a new arms race with China,\" Mr Gore said in a statement.</p>",
  "Hugo Chavez, formerly a mutinous paratrooper, has just won an enviable 59% in the Venezuelan elections, confirming him as the \"king of plebiscites\" - as one paper said - and as president for the next six years. The timely release of this biography speaks well of Richard Gott's wisdom on Latin America. <p>Simon Bolivar (1783-1830), the liberator who inspired Hugo Chavez's quest to remove the old order, once said that South American nations \"must make kings whom we call presidents\". He did not say \"and make courtiers out of the English left\". But that too came to pass. </p> <p>Until economic chaos in the late 1980s revealed the depth of its corruption, Venezuela was the most robust democracy in Latin America. Between November 1998 and December 1999, Venezuelans voted five times. Now Chavez has a mandate for reform, and he must show that he is as good at governing as at sweeping away an old system. Gott ably describes Chavez's dream of a \"Bolivarian\" revolution - a mixture comparable with developmentist programmes of the 1960s and 1970s. </p> <p>Chavez shot to Latin American notoriety on February 4, 1992, when he led a rebellion against the government of Carlos Andres Perez, then in his second term in office. The paratroop officer failed and spent two years in prison, then slowly began to build his platform for government. </p> <p>Since he took office in February 1999, Chavez has proclaimed his identification with the Cuban revolution, and roused members of the dormant Opec oil-producing cartel o secure a three-fold increase in world oil prices. But just when he had won a massive \"Yes\" vote in the December constitutional-reform referendum, tropical rains hit Caracas with awesome force. On ecember 16, 1999, huge chunks of Caracas's shanties, and some not-so-poor suburbs, were wiped out by ferocious floods coming down from the Avila mountain. Thousands of slum-dwellers were killed, and an estimated 100,000 people were made homeless. </p> <p>Gott's view of Chavezis largely flattering. He sees Chavez as the most intriguing political figure to have emerged in Latin America since Fidel Castro. This could be a blessing for academics seeking fresh material for their theses, but it is a doubtful gift to democratic progress in South America. We would really like to see fewer Messiahs and more ordinary men and women with good economic management credentials. </p> <p>The author describes the Venezuelan's vision and presents a far-reach ing alternative future for Latin America. But presumably, like those before him, Chavez will eventually be screwed by his leftist friends, who will claim that his brand of revolution is not good enough.Gott is thorough in his description of Chavez's efforts. He ompares the country's pre-Chavez political structure to a one-party East European system, in which two groups simply agree to take turns at the presidency And he has an entertaining chapter on the selection of \"Miss Venezuela\", which ignores the Caribbean nation's indigenous people and descendants of Africans, because, he is told, \"Venezuelans would not feel represented by a black woman\". </p> <p>Gott's 1960s book, Guerrilla Movements In Latin America, is a definitive text, and he is an experienced writer on the area. But one's impression had been that his generation of British Latin Americanists, who dictated good ideas for governance from comfortable homes in England, had all retired. It is irksome to read England's incestuous, leftist Latin American specialists deciding what is best for the hemisphere. Theysang the praises of Peron, Castro, Guevara, Omar Torrijos, and Forbes Burnham. I had liked to think that Richard Gott knew better, so his infatuation with Chavez is alarming. We have yet to see if the Venezuelan leader will leave a legacy any more worth celebrating than the rest of them.</p>"
