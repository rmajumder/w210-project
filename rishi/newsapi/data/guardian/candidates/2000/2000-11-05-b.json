  "<p>What a difference a win makes? To the boo boys, as George Graham calmly acknowledges, it makes none whatsoever. But the Tottenham manager is never one to shirk a challenge; this is the man who called for the army to deal with an ugly mob of Millwall supporters when cutting his managerial teeth down at the Den. </p> <p>Graham is patently more interested in the opinion of his chairman, his players, and the majority of supporters who put backing the team ahead of hacking at an unloved manager. Well, they certainly did yesterday, a factor which Graham acknowledged helped Tottenham to a vital victory. 'They deserve a pat on the back today,' he purred, smirking as only George Graham can. It will have amused him that the only voices singing 'Sack the board' and 'Georgie is a Gooner' came from Wearside. </p> <p>When the Tottenham lynch mob are in full voice you feel that ominous vibration in the air but if the general mood of the crowd yesterday was anything to go by, it is a small faction. Although hardly buoyant, the faithful happily accentuated the positive. </p> <p>A season ticket holder on his way out quipped 'Graham out' with such a big smile on his face it was impossible to detect whether he was being ironic or really meant it while being simultaneously happy to win. Either way it has to be progress. </p> <p>Confidence teeters on a knife edge at the Lane. When Sunderland were awarded a penalty all that latent frustration seemed set to detonate. It flew over the bar, and when Spurs dashed off to take the lead suddenly the mood was sweetness and light. Tellingly, when Don Hutchison equalised the supporters didn't turn on the players as they have of late. 'That was very important,' added Graham. </p> <p>Is his message getting through? While the fans remain split about whether the Sugar-Graham double act can brew another vintage side what they need above all is some reassurance Spurs are on the right track. They have not yet seen enough consistency, or sparks of inspiration, to quell fears they are stagnating in the land of mediocrity. Make no mistake this was a critical result, but edging a tough encounter at home to a Sunderland side who don't travel well doesn't disguise the size of the job ahead. </p> <p>None the less, Graham still aims to meet his basic objective of a top-six finish, hoping this admirably determined performance will prove a turning point: 'We have a lot of good players to come back so if we can pick up results until then I don't see why not.' </p> <p>Nothing will irk him more than being dubbed a failure, especially here, where his critics need no invitation to use his Arsenal past to question his commitment. Nasty though the brickbats are, you sense part of him secretly enjoys it. It only spurs him on.</p>",
  "<p>My wife would kill me if she knew what I was doing to that blonde, but I don't see how I can vote for Hillary Rodham Clinton. My vote against her in the New York Senate race could put Republican bats in charge of Congress and the White House, where they are certain to suck the blood of the working class - by privatising social security. </p> <p>Yet I hesitate about Hillary. It all goes back to something Ron Brown, the late Commerce Secretary, said about our dear First Lady: 'I'm not Hillary's mother-f***ing tour guide.' </p> <p>To know what that's all about, turn back to Arkansas 1976, when Bill Clinton won election to the powerful state post of Attorney General. I hunted down Clinton's old ally Zack Polatt, of Little Rock, to talk about those glory days. </p> <p>Clinton ran his campaign on fighting the despised local electricity company, Arkansas Power. Funny thing was, Polatt told me, Arkansas consumer organisations were defeated in court by the power company's sharp lawyers, Webster Hubbell and Hillary Rodham of Rose Law. </p> <p>At the time, Hillary would not use her husband's name. She strategically switched to 'Mrs Clinton' only while crying crocodile tears for the oppressed. The official biography of the 'Flotus' (government-speak for First Lady of the United States) lists her six-month stint on a child-protection task force. Yet nowhere does it mention her six years on the board of Wal-Mart Corporation, notorious during her directorship for alleged abuses of child labour. Sam Walton called her 'My little lady' and paid her fees equal to 60 per cent of her income as a lawyer. </p> <p>Fast forward to 1994 and the Brown 'tour guide' business. According to Nolanda Hill, the Commerce Secretary's long-time business partner and love interest, Brown, who died in 1996, endorsed a Hillary cash-for-access scheme ($10,000 for coffee with the President, $100,000 for a night in the Lincoln bedroom), but resented the discount rate the Flotus put on US executives joining his lucrative trade missions. 'I'm worth more than $50,000 a pop!' </p> <p>A reflection of the Brown-Hillary scheme is visible in a document The Observer obtained through the US Freedom of Information Act, dated June 1994. In the memo, Jude Kearney, Commerce Department officer (and Clinton chum from Arkansas) warned someone called 'JCB' of power company Entergy that his employer would be locked out of Brown's upcoming China mission unlessit was 'politically connected'. </p> <p>By the end of the month, Entergy, whose partner in the China venture was the Riady family of Indonesia, would connect big time to both Flotus and 'Potus' (the President) and get its spot on the China mission, on which it signed a billion-dollar deal with the Chinese. </p> <p>On 27 June James Riady paid Webster Hubbell, Hillary's former law partner, $100,000. How strange. Hubbell was under indictment for fraudulently inflating his legal bills, a felony. I've conducted investigations of lawyer overbilling. How can one law partner to fake detailed time logs without the complicity of another lawyer in the firm? Hillary's logs were worth close inspection by authorities. </p> <p>Funny thing about Hillary's billing records: when requested for disclosure in an unrelated matter they disappeared. First, her law firm's computers went ka-blooey. Then the paper printouts vanished, but not before, during the 1992 Presidential campaign, they were secretly combed over, line by line, by two of her partners, Vince Foster and Web Hubbell. </p> <p>Hubbell knew his own logs were phonied, and he understood the consequences of exposure. Ultimately, bloated hours on those records caused him to lose his law licence, his ministerial post (the President had appointed him Assistant US Attorney General) and his freedom - 21 months in the slammer. </p> <p>What did Foster and Hubbell see and know about Hillary's logs? Hubbell won't say, except for a cryptic remark, after seeing her bills, that 'every lawyer' fabricates records. Hubbell pleaded guilty, but refused to answer investigators' questions, a requirement in any plea bargain, so the judge had to sentence him to prison. </p> <p>Why would Hubbell choose to do time on the chain gang over testifying about the Flotus? His prosecutors did not know at the time of a $100,000 Riady payment, the first of over half a million dollars Hubbell would receive from Clinton friends in the weeks up to his entering jail. </p> <p>Foster didn't speak either - and now he can't. Hubbell, a jovial good ol' boy, had the temperament to suffer a brush with ruin with a grin... and wait for friends of Bill and Hill to stuff his piggy bank. Foster, who Clinton made a White House counsel, had a less flexible personality. On 20 July, 1993, as Rose Law fake billings were about to become public, Foster committed suicide. </p> <p>Files of the Flotus were removed from Foster's White House office prior to the arrival of the FBI. Her billing records reappeared two years later just outside her office, right after Hubbell's refusal to testify against her. </p> <p>By overbilling, Hubbell admits he stole from his partners and clients. Some sued Hubbell, but the Flotus did not. Imagine: Hillary, a supposed victim of the overbilling scam not only refused to sue the thief who cheated her, she helped make him wealthy on his way to prison. The lady's a saint, unless - and I'd never believe this - she was in on Hubbell's scam. </p> <p>Maybe the Clintons knew nothing about the big money flowing to prison-bound Hubbell. Knowledge of the payments would suggest they were buying Hubbell's silence. In 1996, when the LA Times uncovered the payments, the President stone-cold denied he knew anything about it. </p> <p>Then, this past April, in a deposition by the Justice Department weirdly unreported by the US press, Clinton changed his tune. Investigators confronted the President with this: on 20 June 1994, Hubbell met with the Flotus. Two days later, James Riady met with Hubbell for breakfast, then went to the White House, met again with Hubbell, then made two more treks to the White House. Two days later, a videotape shows the beginning of a meeting in the Oval Office between Clinton and Riady before the tape goes blank. Two days after that, Hubbell gets his $100,000 through a Riady bank. </p> <p>Lying to journalists is a venal sin, but lying to the Feds is perjury. In his deposition, the President's denial transformed into amnesia. He couldn't remember if Riady mentioned the payment. Then, the President slyly opened the door to the truth. 'I wouldn't be surprised if James told me,' Clinton said. Neither would I. </p> <p>Riady said other surprising things to Clinton. According to FBI debriefing papers, on 14 August 1992 the Indonesian billionaire, riding with candidate Clinton in a limousine, promised to give $1 million to Clinton's campaign. Riady made good on his promise through sham donors, a violation of US laws against concealed and foreign donations. </p> <p>What did Riady get? The Flotus herself, says Nolanda Hill, forced Brown to accept the appointment of Riady's bag man, John Huang, as a Commerce Department deputy. Huang's first order of business was to wheedle his way into confidential CIA briefings on Indonesia and China, then call Riady and his Entergy partners. </p> <p>The very day Riady met the President, diaries show he called on a Clinton crony at the top of the department's Export-Import Bank. 'We just came over from the Oval Office,' is a nice way to provide assurance of the 'political connection' required for help. These and other Riady team meetings at Commerce are marked 'social'. Yet, shortly thereafter, the department agreed to promote and fund the Riady-Entergy China venture. </p> <p>Influence is not a victimless crime. Riady and his minions' visits to the White House (94 times!) included successful requests for the President to meet Indonesian dictator Suharto and to kill negative reports on East Timor and working conditions in Indonesia. Timorese and Indonesians paid for these policy flips with blood. </p> <p>As a loyal Democrat, I will never accept that the $1m slipped to the Clinton campaign and the cash for Hillary's tight-lipped partner Hubbell connect in any way with Clinton administration actions - no matter what the evidence says. But it does shake my belief in the Flotus. </p> <p>Which leaves me with her Republican opponent, Congressman Rick Lazio, the disarming young man with the little-boy grin. Little Ricky, whom I remember trying to sabotage a government racketeering case. Ricky the Rat? Forget it. </p> <p>So, Hillary, I'm back, flowers and vote in hand. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:gregory.palast@observer.co.uk\">gregory.palast@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>America's Queen: The Life of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis </strong><br>Sarah Bradford<br>Viking \u00a320, pp690<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501841486,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p> If Diana, Princess of Wales, had not died with Dodi al Fayed in that terrible Paris car crash, I wonder how she would be regarded today. What if she and Dodi had got married? Would we still accept her as the 'queen of our hearts' if she were now the daughter-in-law of the absurd proprietor of Harrods? As it is, the tragedy has made such questions redundant. Her status as a national icon - the beautiful, warm-hearted, exploited princess, the ideal queen who has been denied us - is likely to remain secure. </p> <p>Tragedy made Jacqueline Kennedy an icon too - a far greater icon than Diana - but the tragedy in her case was the death of her husband, John Fitzgerald Kennedy. She had 30 more years to live after his assassination in Dallas in 1963, and during that time she horrified the world, and especially the Kennedy clan, by marrying the monstrous, bullying Greek shipping billionaire, Aristotle Onassis. </p> <p>But even this failed to knock her off her pedestal, for she never forfeited the adulation of her fellow Americans. She remained fixed forever in their imaginations as the 'marble' widow at Kennedy's funeral, a grieving heroine who, as Sarah Bradford puts it, 'restored America's pride', exorcising the shame of the killing of the thirty-fifth President and becoming, in Frank Sinatra's words, 'America's queen'. </p> <p>This was not entirely ordained by fate. Despite the strain of being married to a serial adulterer, Jackie Kennedy was a ruthless promoter of the Kennedy image while her husband was alive, and its ferocious custodian until her death in 1994. She regarded loyalty as the paramount virtue and anyone, even among her husband's greatest admirers, who went even the tiniest bit 'off message', as we would say now, would be brutally ejected from her circle, often never to be readmitted. </p> <p>She was fully aware of her power as a national icon and once told the historian William Manchester, when she was trying to censor his official account of the assassination, that she was bound to win the argument because 'anybody who is against me will look like a rat unless I run off with Eddie Fisher'. (This was before she ran off with Onassis.) </p> <p>Fiercely protective of her privacy, and commendably determined to bring up her two children, Caroline and John Jnr in as normal a way as possible in the most difficult circumstances, she was deeply suspicious of the press and extremely haughty towards it. Helen Thomas, a White House reporter, told Bradford that she 'treated the press like so many foreign invaders'. Once, when Jackie arrived back in Washington from Hyannis Port, the Kennedy home in Massachusetts, bearing a puppy given her as a birthday present by her father-in-law, Ambassador Joe Kennedy, the press sent her a note asking what she would feed it. She replied with one word: 'Reporters.' </p> <p>But the press played her game, perhaps because it knew the public would never stomach the truth. Not until several years after JFK's death did the public hear anything about his addiction to sex ('I swear to you, and this is absolutely true, at this point it was chicer not to have slept with the President than to have slept with him,' said one New York society debutante), his dependence on amphetamines for his agonising back pain, or his father's links with the Chicago mafia. </p> <p>If Jackie could tolerate her husband's infidelities and take part in the conspiracy to conceal them from the world, this may have been because her father, the handsome, drunken wastrel John Vernou Bouvier III - 'Black Jack', as he was called - was at least as bad. She adored him and was proud of his success with women, while he, in turn, warned her that 'all men are rats'. </p> <p>She was conditioned by her family background to gravitate instinctively towards powerful, dominant men and, especially, very rich ones. She was obsessed with money, which she saw as the key to security and independence, and would never have married anyone less than a multi-millionaire. She was, Bradford frequently tells us, the ultimate American geisha. </p> <p>This consummate myth-maker was brought up on a myth - that the Bouviers were descended from the highest nobility of France. Despite indisputable evidence that they were descended from lowly French shopkeepers, the family stuck to its story. Jackie may also have been influenced by a remark of her father-in-law during Jack's election campaign that 'It's not about what you are, it's about what people think you are'. Image was on JFK's mind to the end. His last words to his wife on that fateful car ride through Dallas were: 'Take off the glasses, Jackie.' </p> <p>In this highly readable, if too long and sometimes repetitious, account of her life, Bradford brings out Jackie's appealing qualities - her intelligence, curiosity and sense of fun, as well as her selfless devotion to her children and her extraordinary courage. But the real Jackie remains concealed behind the protective shell with which she surrounded herself since childhood to keep an ugly and dangerous world at bay. </p> <p>As First Lady, she was no Hillary Clinton. She had little interest in and no influence over policy. To the White House, she contributed nothing practical except the taste of a cultivated society woman in its hugely expensive refurbishment. But she invented and nurtured the Camelot myth that still enthrals the world, and that was hardly a small achievement.</p>",
  "When Rupert Murdoch decreed his Fox television network must turn over an hour of its primest time - between eight and nine in the evening - to unadulterated Bush and Gore, just 2.9 million Americans tuned in. An all-time low, a fiasco. There will probably be an actual turn-out to match on Tuesday. This undynamic duo (as Willie Whitelaw would say) are touring the country trying, pretty successfully, to stir up apathy. <p>But consider: one day, the face of the victor will be chiselled from Mount Rushmore. One day his picture will hang in national galleries and his shrine of a memorial library will draw visitors to Austin or Nashville. Presidents of the United States aren't only politicians who managed to get elected; they become monarchs, gods and legends. It is the great dislocation of the race. While the watching millions weren't switching to Fox, five times that number were watching Martin Sheen play at being President in NBC's West Wing . The drama and the romance of the job still command an audience. </p> <p>But what, precisely, is the job? Stanley O. Jones, a professor of politics at the University of Wisconsin, asked a few questions of the freshman class at Beloit College there. They couldn't (among other things) remember Reagan; they had no idea that Americans were ever held hostage in Iran; they had never seen black-and-white TV; they knew only one Pope - and only one President. For young voters - the most turned-off of the lot - the once and continuing Commander-in-Chief is a man called Clinton and the job is what he's made of it. </p> <p>Jones is making a crucial point in a new collection of essays called The Permanent Campaign and its Future . Once, presidents stood for election. Now they run for election, and Clinton is the great runner. He's been running all his adult life and that life begins to draw to a premature close when there is nowhere else for him to run. Thus the running defines the role. </p> <p>Are Gore and Bush similarly fleet of foot and silvery of tongue? No, they're both comparative plodders. How, then, will they survive in the Oval Office? With lumpen difficulty. </p> <p>The calibre of the contenders, in reality, does not shrink. Is Gore a duffer candidate than Dukakis? Is Bush more intellectually challenged than Gerald Ford? (In fact, if elected, he and Herbert Hoover will tie as the most highly educated presidents in the last eight decades.) What the presidency does do is alter in its demands, a chameleon of elective office. </p> <p>There's no Cold War any longer, so the military dimension is gone and, with it, the awed deference due to the supreme general. Soon, no would-be president will ever have had a realistic chance of putting on a combat uniform. Even now, a few months in fatigues reporting from Vietnam or flying jets for the Texas national guard seems to do duty as the red badge of courage. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the need to raise funds has spiralled beyond previous imagining. Bush has spent $187 million this year. That lowering mountain of need has to be thought of and climbed every month of every year. </p> <p>But perhaps the most profound difference of all is in the parties behind the present pair. They are smaller than they were, diminished bands of activists trading insults across the bowed heads of tens of millions of independents; but diminution also makes those who remain more committed, more ornery, less willing to compromise. </p> <p>The zealotry of the House of Representatives' Newt Gingrich helped fashion is no accident, nor its ruthless pursuit of Clinton's impeachment. When Bush promises kinder, gentler times inside the beltway, he doesn't say how he will change his own visceral warriors there like Tom Delay, the majority whip. </p> <p>We reach election day, of course, without any agreed national budget, stalled between the Hill and the Oval Office. Another symbolic failure: the 106th Congress of the United States has done little but squabble (and line its own pork barrels). These are not accidental impotencies. The balances on Capitol Hill are desperately close: five victories will give the Democrats the Senate, seven the House. Nobody knows how that will look on Wednesday morning - three donkeys ringing on the slot machine or three elephants, but just as likely another division of power. What can be guaranteed, though, is that the focus will immediately switch to 2002 and the next round in the struggle for control. </p> <p>More cash to be raised, more rubber chickens, more wheeler-dealing and long days on the stump. There is never (as Clinton discovered in 1994, when the Congress swung against him) time to govern; there is only the need to keep running. </p> <p>Gore acknowledges that explicitly in his 'fighting' rhetoric and implicitly in interminable photo opportunities, sprinting between speeches, dragging a puffing Joe Lieberman in his wake. Winning the presidency is not the end, but the beginning of new races. </p> <p>Back to the great dislocation. Bush and Gore are being judged - by public opinion and the press - not for what they are, but what they are not. They are not Clinton, with his silky skills, his easy tongue, his undoubted brilliance at running to extricate himself from the last fine mess. </p> <p>Gore oozes facts and policies, yet he can't sell them like Bill. George W. relies on jokes to get him through, but he doesn't tell them as well as Bill. Both of them know that, in office, they would soon have to go crawling after compromise on the Hill: Gore pleading with the warrior Republicans, Bush in all probability needing the Democrats to keep him grounded in independent America where the next batch of votes will come from. </p> <p>Does Tuesday matter? Hugely, in many ways. The President is top dog in foreign policy and rigging the Supreme Court. His choice, for Americans, defines who they are and where they find their own centre of gravity. He will, whoever he is, set an agenda on health, education, social security, that tips some of the balances. </p> <p>But that is also all of a piece with the Murdoch ratings debacle. These are men of the centre ground trying to disguise it, wriggling back and forth and pretending to be something else: the Vice-President who doesn't campaign as well as his master and the Governor whose day job is mostly ceremonial. They field their wives and families like Windsors facing one kind of election and trade trillion-dollar plans like central bankers proving their gravitas. Why should the missing millions be so fascinated by that when Martin Sheen in West Wing does the charade so much better? </p> <p>Predictions are a mug's game. Bush is strong, but weaker in the states that count. Gore is weak, but beginning to erode the preening self-regard, the essential flippancy of the Nader campaign. America can't make up its mind: and that, I think, is because America knows in its heart of hearts that this is just another choice along the way, the choice before the next one.</p> <p><b> THE GORE TEAM</b> </p> <p> Democrat party spending </p> <p> <b> $100m</b> </p> <p> <b> JOE LIEBERMAN </b></p> <p><b> Vice President</b> </p> <p>Considered the 'conscience' of Senate and Democrat party; Orthodox Jew, moral voice and seasoned moderate; good cop and bad cop all in one. </p> <p> <b> BILL DALEY </b> </p> <p><b> Chief of Staff</b> </p> <p>Tough nut from the 'other' Democrat dynasty in Chicago, brought in to rescue and direct campaign.

  "The Clinton administration cares so much about the Irish peace process that they even try to stop television programmes being broadcast about it. Last month one of the President's men rang up Ulster Television, concerned about a forthcoming documentary which was to reveal the extent of the IRA's arms smuggling in Florida. The Oval Office official tried to persuade UTV's head of news and current affairs, Rob Morrison, that the investigation could have a damaging impact on the prospects for lasting peace, especially on the confidence of Ulster Unionists. Morrison ignored Yank hints that the film, fronted by Trevor Birney, should be shelved. <p>Birney has been responsible for some of the best and bravest scoops, from his expos\u00e9 of the UDA's drug dealing in west Belfast to the IRA's murder of dissident republican Joe O'Connor. His last film for UTV's Insight was titled 'Killing for Peace'. Perhaps Birney should make a follow-up focussing on the Clinton administration's attempts to get the first programme binned. A working title could be 'Uncle Sam Says Silence for Peace'. The lengths to which the American government was prepared to go to preserve that one jewel left in the crown of Bill Clinton's foreign policy demonstrate how important the survival of the peace process is to his historical legacy. </p> <p>Mindful of that, some commentators have been clamouring for a second Clinton visit. Maurice Hayes in the Irish Independent suggested that another Clinton trip to the North would help restore the feel-good factor and propel disgruntled parties at Stormont towards finding a new way forward. Hayes is a sober observer, but even he it seems has become seduced by the power the myth of America can exercise over the political imagination here. He cast his mind back to the Clinton visit to Ireland and the warm glow instilled by the Bill and Hillary show at Belfast City Hall, and appears to have swallowed the 'Days like these' propaganda that coloured so much coverage of the visit. </p> <p>What is forgotten is that during the visit the first dark hints of an end to the IRA ceasefire were conveyed to American officials. As Birney and Julian O'Neil point out in their account of the trip, 'When the President calls', Niall O'Dowd, the Irish Voice publisher, and Congressman Bruce Morrison were taken to a house off the Falls and told on the very day Clinton was in west Belfast that the IRA cessation was about to collapse. Meanwhile, near Crossmaglen, the South Armagh brigade was getting ready to transport a deadly cargo to London. They had already built the massive bomb and while Clinton was in Ireland carried out dummy runs to Canary Wharf. </p> <p>Of course not every aspect of American involvement in the peace process has been inconsequential. George Mitchell played a vital role as talk's facilitator before and after Good Friday 1998. His contribution was infinitely more critical to the process's survival than, say, the over-hyped role of Mo Mowlam. </p> <p>Yet what the latest pining for 'days like these' and the cry for help to the outgoing President reveal is that we are a nation transfixed by America and all it can do for us. It is a new type of benign colonialism, which exaggerates in Messianic tones the efficacy of the USA on our faltering peace process. </p> <p>Gore-the-bore is preferable to George W. Bush. At least Gore knows where Ireland is whereas Dubya, like some of the Republic's soccer team's former English-born stars, would need someone to show him the little piece of sod off Europe and tell him 'that's Ireland, Mr President'. But if America elects Bush, the village idiot from Texas to lead the most powerful parish council on the planet, this Tuesday there will be at least one positive outcome. The isolationism and indifference to foreign affairs that characterise Dubya's outlook will be sobering for those Irish politicians and commentators who invented the orthodoxy that America, through its moral and political clout alone, could secure peace and compromise in the old country.</p>",
  "We speak the same language, watch their films and have fought and died together. Most of us feel we know America well. But the time has come to be wary of our century-long ally. The world's hegemonic power has been becoming more isolationist and self-interested ever since the Cold War ended, but if George Bush becomes President it could become genuinely nasty. <p>As British Euroscepticism reaches more hysterical and irrational peaks, the real story of our times has gone largely unregarded. The superstate whose ambitions menace our sovereignty and frames our policy choices is not the European Union - it is the USA. </p> <p>The range of American influence is already intense and growing. It was American investment banks which wanted to put the London Stock Exchange up for sale to Frankfurt. Our enfeebled film industry depends on distribution through American-owned cinema chains. Our research scientists register their patents at the US Patent Office. Our drug companies seek the approval of the US Federal Drug Administration. Our academics make their intellectual mark by being published in American journals refereed by American professors around American benchmarks and objectives. </p> <p>Our politicians look to America for their policies - William Hague 'denationalising compassion' as he attacks the welfare state or Gordon Brown building a social policy around tax credits are both overtly borrowing from Republicans and Democrats alike. And the American companies buying up our leading firms bring with them the same expectation about how to lobby and how to union-bust as they do at home, generating copycat British political lobbying firms and copycat legal experts adept at bending employment law. </p> <p>This is an American capitalism much harsher and more profit-seeking than ever before. It is creating a society in which everything - even votes - is increasingly up for sale. We think America is the same friend it has always been, but it is changing for the worse. </p> <p>Those with doubts should take a look at the US's relations with the rest of the world. The international framework in which the British operate is firmly run from Washington, and President Clinton has chosen not to challenge a tide in which the assertion of 'America first' is becoming ever more aggressive - and which Bush is pledged to intensify. </p> <p>If you are worried about global warming and climate change, then beware Bush; he will have no truck with any international treaty limiting the emission of American carbon dioxide. Debt relief for the poorest countries? Forget it. The establishment of an international criminal court? Baying for the Moon. Even American support for the United Nations, IMF and World Bank - flawed as they are - should not be taken for granted. Bush, for all his homespun affability, is bad news. </p> <p>He personifies the new business-led American ideology. He portrays Washington and the Federal government as evil, business and the private sector as virtuous. He has no truck with those who worry about the decline of public debate, public spirit or the common interest. Bush's heroes are those of American conservative mythology; the god-fearing, gun-owning, male small farmer or small businessman who is rugged and self-reliant. His 'compassion' does not stretch to spending hard cash on alleviating poverty or promoting educational opportunity. That would be unAmerican. </p> <p>Bush and the coalition of the Business Roundtable, National Rifle Association (NRA) and Christian Right which supports him are indifferent to the gross inequalities that disfigure American life; the mushrooming of millions of 'gated' communities at the top and the harsh insecurity at the bottom. Nor do they worry about environmental despoilation of their country, the violence in their cities or the gross commercialisation that intrudes into every avenue of American endeavour. Rather, they would advance inequality with across-the-board tax cuts that favour the rich, entrench gun ownership, weaken what is left of universal medical and pension provision, and cut corporate interests free of what little regulation remains. It is sheer poison. </p> <p>The depths to which Bush and the Republicans have sunk is their mendacious approach to the impact of money on American politics. This will be the most expensive presidential election campaign ever. Total political advertising expenditure, including soft money, is estimated to be more than $1 billion. And the business givers - the investment banks which demand more financial deregulation, the NRA which wants no change to the gun-control laws, the drug companies opposed to prescription drugs, the oil companies which want to drill in the protected wilderness and so on - all want to buy private advantage at the expense of public interest. </p> <p>In this, the Democrats, however business-friendly they try to be, will always be outspent by the Republicans. The trick is to evade the formal laws on campaign finance by enlisting interest groups to advertise on your behalf, which as long as their adverts do not mention 'vote for' or 'elect', is deemed as soft money - and legal. In the last four weeks, the Republicans and their networks have outspent the Democrats two to one, literally trying to buy the election. </p> <p>It makes a mockery of democracy, as both Bill Bradley and John McCain - challenging for the nomination of the Democrat and Republican parties - argued in the primaries. But while Al Gore is pledged to attempt some reform of campaign finance, Bush is unapologetic. The state should not stand in the way of those who want to give money to politics. </p> <p>It is an indifference to the public domain and accompanying celebration of the private that is uniquely American - and which has deep roots in the experience of the early settlers and the expansion west. Extending citizenship rights beyond the narrow domain established by the eighteenth-century constitution and into the social and economic realm has always been fiercely contested by the American Right as 'unAmerican'. </p> <p>Yet the paradox is that Bush's challenge comes as a growing mass of ordinary Americans are ever more concerned about the harshness of their capitalism, the decline of their politics and the illiberality of much social policy. Religious attendance is falling as is support for capital punishment. There is no fall-away in the support for international engagement. Support for gun control mounts. There is no especial demand for more tax cuts; rather, there is a recognition, as in Britain, that necessary public goods have to be paid for. </p> <p>Without his stunning war chest or the 'integrity' issue after Lewinsky, Bush would be in trouble. But if he wins, or even narrowly loses on Tuesday, his campaign stands as a warning. Beware the powerful American Right - they menace us all. Left-of-centre British Eurosceptics please note. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.algore2000.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.algore2000.com</a><br> <a href=\"http:// www.georgebush.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.georgebush.com</a> <br>Official sites for the leading candidates  <a href=\"http://www.nadertrader.org\" target=\"_NEW\">www.nadertrader.org</a> Vote-swapping website for Nader <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/Election2000\" target=\"_NEW\">www.gallup.com/Election2000</a> Opinion polls <a href=\"http://www.gwbush.com  www.algore-2000.org\" target=\"_NEW\">www.gwbush.com www.algore-2000.org</a> Spoof sites</p>",
  "No two men since the explorers Lewis and Clark have set out to shrink America as have George Bush and Al Gore during the final, frantic week of their nail-biting election campaign. <p>Dispatched by Thomas Jefferson, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark set out on their odyssey of 1805 to prove that the uncharted deserts and mountains of the continent were navigable by man. </p> <p>Last week Bush and Gore demonstrated that it can be criss-crossed like a village green, with a furious offensive of stump-speeches, mass-mailing, media carpet-bombing, aircraft pilots, palm pilots and dot.communion with the voters of America. It's a tribute to Air Traffic Control that their campaign jets have not crashed into one another; in fact, the two motorcades carrying Bush and Gore's running mate Joe Lieberman did cross paths, by pure chance, in Missouri. </p> <p>And Bush himself came close to a nasty crash on Thursday, when it emerged that he had successfully hidden a drunken driving conviction, picked up after a session in a bar in Maine during 1976. </p> <p>Bush was still fighting what appeared to be a successful counter-attack yesterday, winning loud cheers for his condemnation of 'gotcha' politics and helped by the fact that the tip-off to Maine's WPXT TV station - which revealed the conviction - came from Tom Connolly, a former Democratic gubernatorial candidate in the state and delegate to the party's convention in August, who concedes he was out to inflict political damage. </p> <p>Rather than try to capitalise on the revelation, Gore himself - campaigning in his home state of Tennessee - was anxious yesterday to keep a safe distance, forcefully denying any involvement in the leak. </p> <p>Bush's conviction, however, took second place to the question of his honesty, as a Dallas Morning News reporter, Wayne Slater, came forward on Friday to say that in an interview two years ago, Bush denied he had ever been arrested after 1968 - when he got in trouble for a drunken college prank. But Slater - whose paper is among the few to enthusiastically endorse Bush - was shy to pursue the point yesterday, saying the Texas governor was shut up by his press aide. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the campaign cavalry charged on. Apart from dodging scandal and gathering air miles, the Bush camp sent 110 million letters and made 62 million phone calls in five days; Gore's only a few less. Every local radio show has been meticulously targeted: hip-hop stations for rants against police racial profiling (Gore); Country 'n' Western frequencies with dire warnings against gun control (Bush). </p> <p>'The man who can right himself by a vote will never resort to a musket,' wrote James Fenimore Cooper in the American Democrat of 1838. That's as may be, but the virulence of last week's advertise-ments knew no precedent as Tuesday's showdown neared. Each candidate has run dry of policies to attack, so the ads counter-attack the other's attack ads. </p> <p>The burgeoning campaign coffers, apparently bottomless even before last week - have somehow found room for more, as further millions pour into both from corporations, millionaires, trade unions and interest groups. </p> <p>Daily, the two men move further apart over the clues and contradictions as to what kind of President each would make. Methodical Gore; intuitive Bush. Gore the combative policy-cannibal; Bush with his peaceful, easy feelin' - 'What, Me Worry?' Bush has been flattering 'the American people' like his father and Ronald Reagan before him, appealing to their Samaritan instincts while arranging to reward their financial greed. Gore, apparently free of his spin-doctors' chains and master of his own speeches, has become a rat-a-tat soap-box orator, palpitating with zeal. In an increasingly gravelly and imploring voice, he harangues 'the American people', urging them to greater things. </p> <p>Bush's standard speech has boiled down to 'Gore trusts Washington; I trust the people' and 'Gore is a liar; I tell the truth'. Gore's is about fighting for the common man and woman against 'special interests' and 'billionaires'. </p> <p>Their policies are likewise at loggerheads. There is no compromise over who is 'waging class warfare' (of which one accused the other all last week). No middle ground over their collision-course tax policies, plans for social security, healthcare and education, pitched against one another like fighting cocks. </p> <p>The fight itself, however, could not be closer: all that is certain is that on Tuesday the United States of America will elect a new President. Unlike all past elections since opinion polls began in the 1940s, neither candidate is stealing even a nose on the final lap. The vote will go to the wire. Although most polls show Bush creaking ahead in percentage terms, they also give each candidate around 200 votes apiece in the electoral college, with some 130 still to fight for. </p> <p>All the rules have been broken: the number of battleground states up for grabs is even this weekend expanding rather than contracting, forcing the candidates to spread themselves rather than hone in on a slither of voters. The final round is further complicated by the Greens' Ralph Nader, whose ego-maniacal refusal to step down has made him Bush's cherished ally, as he steals votes and time from Gore in the 'swing states'. </p> <p>America was invented in the most crucial of those states, Pennsylvania. Jefferson wrote his declaration in a Philadelphia pub; Lincoln rescued the Union at Gettysburg and industrial barons built the modern nation in Pittsburgh. Fitting, then, that both candidates began their week by blowing through the Keystone State. </p> <p>Bush's speeches were geared to give an aura of inevitable victory. He is not selling a package any longer, he just wants to look like a winner because, in the final hour, that is what people want to back. A curious fact about American elections is that in their aftermath, more people say they voted for the new President than actually did. Bush - although performing to audiences of devotees, Boy Scouts and Christian militants - is sticking to a conservative agenda without using conservative buzzwords. </p> <p>Gore, breezing into Pittsburgh from West Virginia, toured the heartland of the old industrial economy talking about the new one, promising 10 million high-tech jobs in the next decade. Then he nipped to California for some defensive work in the state he must and should win, and to record a Jay Leno talk show. </p> <p>Here we saw the man who wrote his degree thesis on how politicians use television: Gore quipped that voters were like a person with a sick dog, deciding whether to go to the vet or the taxidermist. 'Either way, you get your dog back.' </p> <p>Bush also swung to the West Coast, tearing up the San Andreas fault line faster than any earthquake could, and seeking to rupture California with its biggest on record - a victory for himself. In Oregon, he struck his favourite note: 'Tell them I'm from the West. Okay, it's West Texas. But Texas is a whole lot closer to Oregon than Washington DC.' </p> <p>Riding the general distrust of government, Bush talks about 'Washington' not as a place but a concept, a cabal operating against the interests of 'the people'. Absent from this construct, however, are the size of his spending programme, his own roots in the Northeastern aristocracy and the fact that the wheels driving him to next Tuesday could not have been better oiled than by the Texas-Washington axis. </p> <p>Gore followed the fault line, too, turning one of Bush's favourite lines against him - 'class warfare on behalf of billionaires' - and making voters aware of 'the big choice' facing them, as well he might so far as the rival manifestos are concerned. He joked that he would go to a Hallowe'en party as 'his own man - no mask'. It's his favourite line, but also a bitter one. </p> <p>Gore should by rights win this election - and still could, riding as he does on a magic carpet of unprecedented national well-being. And for a moment during this campaign he held victory in the palms of his hands, but let it slip. That was in Los Angeles, at the Democratic Convention in August, when he was - for once, and as he kept saying - 'his own man'. </p> <p>But Gore's history is one of allowing himself to be moulded and packaged, and after LA he reverted to type. Rather than stick to his newly assertive self-confidence, Gore followed the spinners' instructions and was once again lost between his 'nerd' and his Sopranos acts, neither of which is popular with the voters. Only last week did he again found his authenticity - the premium quality in this election. </p> <p>Next stop, Florida - a contested, glittering prize with Bush this time under pressure, struggling to rally his own faithful. Gore departed the Sunshine State leaving behind his (importantly elderly and Jewish) deputy, Joe Lieberman, returning again to Pennsylvania as Bush made another sweep across the Midwest. </p> <p>'The Shrub' had breezed through Chicago and was in Iowa by the time a drunken driving conviction had been awkwardly (and potentially explosively) revealed, while Gore also hit the Windy City - via New Mexico - in time to find the newsstands splattered with an Esquire cover showing his former boss snapped at crotch level, blue tie pointing towards the organ that kept Ken Starr busy for so long. </p> <p>Over the weekend, the pace will quicken; more Florida, more West Coast, more Midwest, more swing states. Why this frantic, and this close? The answer lies, for the most part, in demographic uncertainties. More than any past election, this one charts the new political map of America, one in which huge swaths of new 'Major Metro' areas are swinging some states for the Democrats, while former bastions of rural liberalism turn to the Republicans. </p> <p>Bush's father won 61 per cent of Florida in 1988, with Gore now showing a narrow lead. New Jersey, once a key 'swing' state, is safely Democratic. Even Ronald Reagan's California should finally settle for Gore. These are states of urban and suburban sprawl - now peaked - where issues like abortion choice and gun control are popular among the 'waitress moms' and their families, important to this election. </p> <p>Meanwhile: Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, West Virginia and others won by Democrat Michael Dukakis in 1988 are either contested or lining up for Bush: they are religious states, independent and bloody-minded, and offended by the Clinton administration. And in between are the places where this election will be won and lost: Michigan, Pennsylvania, Missouri. Until Tuesday, it won't be quite clear who the new demographic map favours. </p> <p>The fact that the Democrats are not poised for any certain victory - White House, Senate or House - is itself a historical anomaly, given the state of the economy and the cultural, generational values set by the Clinton years. </p> <p>As a potential Bush victory, Election 2000 is rather like a reversal of 1976 - a blip won by Jimmy Carter during a period of Republican hegemony, with things put back to rights by the election of Reagan four years later. </p> <p>The seeds of the Democrats' problems at a time they should be riding a roller-coaster were sown during the second Clinton administration: the distractions of scandal and impeachment, but more importantly the inability of that administration to turn its victory of 1996 into an unassailable, popular majority politics consolidating the white working class, urban and rural - a failure on which Bush now rides. </p> <p>The other reasons for the dead heat are the candidates and campaigns themselves. There are two prisms through which to look at Bush: you can either see him as the man who spent more money than any other politician in history, only to squander it along with a 17-point lead - or else the man whom the punditocracy backs to be elected President next Tuesday. Behind Bush's success - first and foremost - there is money, as there always has been. All his ventures in business, from oil drilling to the Texas Rangers baseball team, were underwritten and invariably bailed out by big tycoons who were anxious to lubricate their connections to his father. </p> <p>This created the financial base for his governorship of the oil kingdom of Texas, and eventually the present campaign. It was Republican big money that sought out George Bush for this moment, not the other way round. </p> <p>For that reason, the machine sponsoring Bush forgives him everything, even brazen draft-dodging during the Vietnam War (supposed to be the sacred measurement of a man in conservative circles) and even bare-faced lies about his service record after he jumped a line of 100,000 to join the Texas National Guard instead. These things have thus far not mattered, for the packaged Bush is, more than anything, a personification of interests. The drink-drive revelation, however, comes late and is up to the public, not the party, to judge. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.algore2000.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.algore2000.com</a><br> <a href=\"http:// www.georgebush.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.georgebush.com</a> <br>Official sites for the leading candidates  <a href=\"http://www.nadertrader.org\" target=\"_NEW\">www.nadertrader.org</a> Vote-swapping website for Nader <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/Election2000\" target=\"_NEW\">www.gallup.com/Election2000</a> Opinion polls <a href=\"http://www.gwbush.com  www.algore-2000.org\" target=\"_NEW\">www.gwbush.com www.algore-2000.org</a> Spoof sites</p>",
  "After eight years, Bill Clinton still divides us. To the millions of Clinton-haters, ranting over the airwaves of talk radio, Slick Willy is corrupt, philandering, mendacious, even murderous. To Clinton-lovers - and there are millions of those, too - the retiring 42nd president is both a morally questionable but politically superendowed figure, a giant among pygmies. Even his biggest fans are forced to qualify their admiration with disclaimers like 'a self-destructive personality of course' or 'a great President, but a rotten human being'. <p>Love him or loathe him, Clinton is fascinating. America, which is about to say goodbye to him, remains mesmerised. His job approval rating hovers in the high sixties, higher than any retiring President in memory. Not since FDR have the Democrats had such a winner. It is widely acknowledged that if he were running for office, he would walk a third term. In the arts, his turbulent presidency has inspired an astonishing micro-culture of books and films, from White House memoirs to films like Wag The Dog, to television soaps like West Wing. He is a figure for the playwrights, a political rogue of Shakespearean dimensions. </p> <p>Part of Clinton's magic is rather old-fashioned. He has a genius for language, and a genius for people. Rhetorically speaking, he is unbeatable, even through the cool medium of television. His speech, for example, at this year's Democratic convention, was vintage Clinton. Friends and foes alike watched in amazement as, once again, he reached out to the American people with a tour de force recitation of his achievements (balanced budgets, crime-busting, the first steps towards world peace in a number of hot-spots and record-breaking prosperity), while also contriving to gloss over the myriad catastrophes of his administration, from his proposed healthcare reform to the disaster of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. </p> <p>And then there are the legends. The healthcare reform address to Congress where the teleprompter failed, and Clinton ad-libbed for 10 minutes without missing a beat, until the text was found. The impromptu speech to black church leaders in Memphis that those who heard it say rivalled Martin Luther King for eloquence. </p> <p>On these occasions, and on many others, too, Clinton's extraordinary gift is memorably to express what people have been vaguely thinking, but also to connect, in the most personal way, with his audience. Many commentators have noted the physical urgency of his public appearances, the hunger for approval in his embrace of the electorate, and his spooky capacity to tune into the voters' consciousness. </p> <p>His appetite for people, and for bringing people together, which you can psychoanalyse for hours (abusive father, broken home etc), and which has led him astray in his personal life, is also quite extraordinary. During the make-or-break primary campaign in New Hampshire in 1992, it was estimated he had shaken hands with no less than a fifth of the state's voters. As an amateur Clinton-watcher, I must have spoken with more than a score of lobbyists (journalists, policy wonks, administrators) who have found themselves in the President's company, experiencing the full force of the 'Clinton effect'. Not one has failed to mention his amazing capacity apparently to focus on their needs, to woo their support, to leave them weak-kneed with an excitement that's almost sexual. </p> <p>Men, who have all the facts at their fingertips, come away astounded by his grasp of arcane detail. Women, who think they know better, find themselves swept off their feet. Those ice-blue eyes search into you, apparently, as if you were the only person in the world, challenging, seductive and hypnotic. Joe Klein, the author of Primary Colors, perhaps the single best book to have been inspired by Clinton, puts it this way: 'He is a genius with his left hand. He might put it on your elbow or up by your biceps, and then he'll flash that famous misty look of his. And he will mean it.' What, exactly, he will mean is another dimension of his appeal. With Clinton, ambiguity is all. </p> <p>America will miss him for this, and for another, even greater, quality - his capacity to use the 'bully pulpit' of the presidency to connect with the bereaved, the dispossessed, and the walking wounded. It is one of the ironies of Clinton's presidency that such a flawed father should be so good at playing the Father of the Nation. </p> <p>One of his finest hours was his response to the Oklahoma City bombing. Despite the partisan frenzy he arouses, Clinton has, to a remarkable degree, been the President for all the people, black and white, rich and poor, immigrant and establishment. American liberals will charge that he betrayed the historic Democrat agenda, that he cynically enacted welfare reform in quest of re-election. There's no escaping the fact, however, that leaving aside his silver tongue, he has materially improved the lives of millions of the least advantaged. </p> <p>In a recent New Yorker assessment, Klein, a journalist who has reflected deeply on Clinton's extraordinary personality, wrote that the President's misfortune, from the point of view of the history books, with which Clinton is reportedly obsessed, was to have been untested by a great crisis like a war. But I wonder if this is right. For much of his first and second term, Clinton was at war - with that 'vast right-wing conspiracy' even sober Republicans such as Dole and Gingrich now concede to have been orchestrated by the President's Republican enemies. Whitewater and Kenneth Starr's investigation, from this perspective, was Clinton's Guadalcanal, a hand-to-hand battle that left the field piled with corpses but the White House flag still flying, just. </p> <p>The attempt by the Clinton-haters to run Bill and Hillary out of town was unprecedented in its sustained ferocity. The remarkable way in which he managed to turn the grinding legalism of the impeachment procedure to his advantage was characteristic of a man for whom getting out of a tight corner is second nature. Agreed, without the dreadful moral lapse of the Lewinsky affair, the Starrs and the Gingriches and the monstrous regiments of Republicans would have had little, or nothing to exploit. In the event, there was a firestorm of media controversy. Many commentators predicted his resignation, his obliteration. And still he survived. He has always been the 'Comeback Kid', the character whom no amount of bruising on the bitter asphalt of political conflict could suppress. Nevertheless, the way in which he survived impeachment and acknowledged his faults may eventually be seen as his finest hour. More than that, he flourished, and presided over the biggest peacetime boom in living memory, a boom that may not have been of his making but which he was smart enough to influence at a number of crucial turning points. </p> <p>Maybe the buoyancy of the markets is a reminder that, in the age of globalisation, a President does not count for much. But that's only half true. Where he does count is, for instance, in his appointments to the Supreme Court, and, more generally, in setting a tone, in articulating a vision, in elevating the national aspiration. Clinton may have been an untrustworthy human being, but, whether it's Gore, the prince charmless, or Bush, the son feckless (the jerk or the moron - as some would have it) who steps into the Oval Office in January, either will be hard pressed to match Clinton's astounding ability to build convincing rhetorical bridges across the dark, ungovernable chasms of contemporary American society.</p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.algore2000.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.algore2000.com</a><br> <a href=\"http:// www.georgebush.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.georgebush.com</a> <br>Official sites for the leading candidates  <a href=\"http://www.nadertrader.org\" target=\"_NEW\">www.nadertrader.org</a> Vote-swapping website for Nader <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/Election2000\" target=\"_NEW\">www.gallup.com/Election2000</a> Opinion polls <a href=\"http://www.gwbush.com  www.algore-2000.org\" target=\"_NEW\">www.gwbush.com www.algore-2000.org</a> Spoof sites</p>",
  "Support for Al Gore was showing unexpected strength in key states last night as suggestions that George Bush had lied about a secret conviction for drunken driving dominated the US election race. <p>First polls suggested that Bush's conviction 24 years ago was not an issue for two-thirds of the voters and that he was holding on to his slim lead. </p> <p>But in the 13 battleground states, which Bush must capture if he is to reach the White House, they showed Gore edging ahead. </p> <p>For Bush, whose campaign is based on 'trust', the drink-driving disclosures raise obvious questions about his trustworthiness and selective memory and recall President Bill Clinton's evasiveness in the Monica Lewinsky affair. </p> <p>Even Republican workers think he should have disclosed this conviction 15 months ago, at the start of his run for the presidency. </p> <p>Worse, his protestations about 'youthful' indiscretions sit uneasily with the fact that he was 30 at the time of his arrest, and with the fact that here, as in a previous drink-driving scrape, he had younger Bushes with him in the car. </p> <p>Drink is a special demon for substantial parts of the electorate in the more conservative states, where memories of the Prohibition era are by no means dead and laws preventing the sale of alcohol to teenagers are far more rigorously enforced than in Britain. </p> <p>The Democrats are not overtly exploiting the issue, fearing that it could rebound as a 'smear' or, as Bush put it, as 'gotcha politics'. </p> <p>In his home state of Tennessee, Gore denied any part in the leak to a TV station that Bush had been found guilty of drink-driving in 1976. </p> <p>The revelation came in defiance of an assurance by Bush to a reporter two years ago that he not been arrested since a college prank in 1968. </p> <p>Though Gore is standing well back, his aides said privately they hoped the question mark over Bush's honesty would affect voters' views of him, but agreed that it would be hard to measure. </p> <p>The affair is already proving a gift for television satirists. But in one sense the timing is also lucky for Bush. He has long been evasive about what he calls his 'nomad' years - from 20 to 40, when he found Billy Graham and teetotalism. </p> <p>But with only two days to go to the election, he now seems safe from a full-blooded investigation.</p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.algore2000.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.algore2000.com</a><br> <a href=\"http:// www.georgebush.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.georgebush.com</a> <br>Official sites for the leading candidates  <a href=\"http://www.nadertrader.org\" target=\"_NEW\">www.nadertrader.org</a> Vote-swapping website for Nader <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/Election2000\" target=\"_NEW\">www.gallup.com/Election2000</a> Opinion polls <a href=\"http://www.gwbush.com  www.algore-2000.org\" target=\"_NEW\">www.gwbush.com www.algore-2000.org</a> Spoof sites</p>",
  "The cost of Tony Blair's private office has soared to \u00a310.8 million a year, according to figures released this weekend. <p>The increase, up from \u00a37.5 million a year when Blair came to power in 1997, has led to fresh accusations that the Prime Minister is centralising too much power at Downing Street. </p> <p>Since he swept into Number 10, Blair has trebled the number of advisers who work on policy. There are believed to be a record 18 private secretaries. </p> <p>'These figures reveal the increasingly presidential style of the Prime Minister,' said Norman Baker, the Liberal Democrat MP who has been keeping track on Downing Street spending since 1997. </p> <p>'He is centralising more and more power at Downing Street and is bypassing Parliament to a greater and greater extent,' said Baker. </p> <p>Blair has long battled against the view that he is a 'control freak' who wants all important decisions taken within Number 10. His officials argue that there is now much more work and that extra staff are needed. </p> <p>Earlier this year figures revealed that Number 10 had to deal with 500,000 letters and parcels, an 84 per cent increase on the figure for 1998. Five years ago John Major's staff had about about 25,000 letters a year. </p> <p>But critics say that the large number of special advisers means that much Government policy is being drawn up by unelected officials. </p> <p>There has also been tension between the special advisers - there are now believed to be 78 across all departments - and civil servants who say that their role has been usurped.</p>"
