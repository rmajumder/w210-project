  "<p>It is estimated that, for the first time this year, more than $1bn will be spent on the elections in the US (state as well as presidential). Of this figure, $400m will go on advertising. Surely, at these levels of spend, there must be much to learn from America? It is well known that both Conservatives and Labour visit the US to learn what's new in electioneering. Should the advertising advisers go there too? </p> <p>The simple answer is that they needn't bother. There is now a convenient website (<a href=\"http://www.adcritic.com\">www.adcritic.com</a>) that keeps you up to date with advertising in the US, even featuring the latest TV commercials for the candidates. Which is lucky, because it wouldn't be worth the price of a ticket to see the drab succession of tit-for-tat commercials that both camps are churning out. </p> <p>This is a missed opportunity. As Roy Spence, president of ad agency GSD&amp;M of Austin, Texas points out: \"Unlike in the past, advertising could play a pivotal role in this election. In the past there were fundamental differences, and the ads played a supportive role to the messages. The issues and personalities were so stark, publicity played a supporting, not a primary, role. This time the economy is strong, there's not a world at war, Bush has moved to the middle, and there's a lot of blurring of lines in terms of the average person out there. All of that leads to advertising playing a major role.\" </p> <p>In the event, however, this has not been the outcome. Kathy Delaney, creative director of the Deutsch ad agency in New York, says: \"Both candidates do themselves a disservice by producing commercials that look and sound like bad informercials. They're invisible. It's 'Blah, blah, blah' cut against sappy music. Compelling, single-minded, believable commercials are completely missing here. The best advertising starts with a single honest truth about the brand. This stuff is served up in such a mundane, cliched way that even if there is a truth in there, it blew right by me.\" </p> <p>What the hapless US viewers are getting is what we used to get in UK party political broadcasts in the 70s - the illustrated talking head. The candidate talks to camera and when he makes a point you cut away to an illustration, as though you were a backward child who needed it all spelt out in picture-book style. </p> <p>So Bush addresses you on medical matters and when he says something about old people you get a picture of someone being pushed along in a wheelchair. In really exciting versions you get a bit of tabletop illustration, too - maybe a pile of dollar bills to make the point that it will cost money. </p> <p>There are two sorts of these commercials. First there's the one where the talking head says what his policy is before slagging off the other guy's stance on that area. The subject changes almost daily (the environment on Wednesday, Medicare on Thursday) and takes different forms for each state and for each ethnic and linguistic group (no wonder they have to be cheap and quickly made). Second, there's the \"morning in America\" life story of the candidate. It's not really advertising at all. </p> <p>The only change of pace comes from Ralph Nader (the ex-consumerist leader and now an independent presidential candidate). He makes TV ads attacking both the other candidates for spending fortunes making TV ads! </p> <p>What has happened? No especially golden period of US political advertising springs to mind, but there have been some memorable ads - LBJ's anti-Goldwater \"Daisy\" ad, with the child counting down to an atomic explosion; the unfair but memorable Republican attack on Dukakis's furlough policy that supposedly let killers out of jail to kill again. </p> <p>It seems that now the politicians have decided that they know it all and give no room to the advertising advisers (there was a telling shot in the programme about Clinton's Little Rock campaign headquarters, featuring a staff member on the telephone \"ordering up\" a tightly specified ad for the following day). That's not advertising. That's just spin, baldly stated in TV slots. There is no \"defining\" advertising theme, no strategy. Its use is solely tactical and day to day. </p> <p>The past 20 years have seen political campaigners on both sides of the Atlantic come on in leaps and bounds in their understanding of how to get through to the public. Much of this is learned from the world of advertising: the focus-group feedback, the concise message, speaking in unison, the need for repetition. Politicians have got very good at communicating - so good, it seems, that they have decided there's no room left for the input of advertising agencies. In the US, tedious ads make it obvious that the creative imagination has not been allowed to brighten things up. </p> <p>Things are rather different in the UK. Peter Mandelson learned the tricks of the trade early on and his Millbank army no longer feels the need for much more than spiky executions of its briefs. The Conservatives have always contracted it out anyway. Saatchis did it all, whether Tim Bell or, successfully in 92 and disastrously in 97, Maurice Saatchi was in charge. After the spectacular failure of their advertising strategy in 97, the Conservatives have clearly decided to internalise strategy too, with the appointment of Yellow M to do the executions. </p> <p>Both Labour and the Conservatives seem to feel that while there's not much room for ad-agency thinking, there's still a role for the memorable ad. With Trevor Beattie and Yellow M - two \"shock jocks\" if ever there were any - we should see some sparks. </p> <p>Despite the fact that the UK is unlikely to be as boring as the US, advertising could be doing more for political parties here as well as across the Atlantic. Brand advertising that creates such enormously valuable properties for companies comes from the understanding that thinking can't sensibly be separated from execution. The great campaigns come from the interaction of strategic planning and creative skills. Big brand owners, like VW or Orange, don't instruct their agencies in detailed content, but allow them latitude to spot the public's nerve end, both in the route to choose and the way that it is expressed. </p> <p>There is a role for advertising in politics beyond the recitation of policy and abuse of the other side. Parties benefit from clarity of positioning in the electorate's mind, and this needs constant adaptation as the context changes. Much of this is done, of course, by the character and message of the leader. But advertising can also delineate the territory. Mitterrand stood for president with a poster that just said \"La force tranquille\", which neatly summed up what he offered in the chaotic environment of French politics. Wilson's Labour grabbed the moment of a dying Conservative government with \"Let's Go with Labour\". </p> <p>Current political advertising is not using any of the skills that advertising agencies have in abundance: the ability to get under the skin of the public, to have insights that coincide with the way the voters, and not the politicians, see it. Advertising can do more than it is being asked to, almost as much in the UK as in the US. </p> <p>\u0095 Chris Powell is chairman of BMP DDB and led Labour's 1997 election campaign advertising</p>",
  "<p>Giuliano Amato's biggest mistake was to resemble a rodent. Possessing a toothy grin, protuberant ears and slender frame, he is called Topolino, Italy's version of Mickey Mouse. Rivals cannot touch him for intellectual or strategic finesse but he is soon to lose his job. A prime minister is no longer allowed to look like a mouse, no matter how mighty. </p> <p>Welcome to Italy's election campaign, where the path to power is via permanent tans, Hollywood smiles and glossy hair. Keep your eyes peeled for policies, they don't show up so brightly on television. Victory belongs to whichever side masters image, for this is a campaign fought almost exclusively through the media. Never have soundbites, photo opportunities and spin mattered so much. </p> <p>Silvio Berlusconi, the conservative opposition leader and media magnate, is firing up his newspapers and television stations for a US presidential-style campaign. Opinion polls put him on course for a spectacular come-back, seven years after he tumbled from the premiership in disgrace. </p> <p>The centre-left government, shaky after four troubled years in power, reckoned its best chance was to chew up its third leader and come up with one even silkier than Berlusconi. The signal for Amato, 61, to walk the plank. He will step down before the election, a decision he announced on a chat show, Porta a Porta. </p> <p>Enter Francesco Rutelli, 46, the mayor of Rome and arguably Italy's best-looking politician. A clean cut, relaxed style has invited comparisons to Tony Blair. Others call him Cicciobello, after a plastic doll. He is not well known and his policies, if he has any, remain a mystery. But that will change from today when he launches his campaign in Milan. Few are better at kissing babies, shaking hands or working crowds. </p> <p>The veteran commentator Indro Montanelli despaired that Italy was choosing leaders based on looks. The newspaper La Repubblica was kinder. \"Rutelli is the novelty, the generational turn, the spirit of competition, the challenge on Berlusconi's grounds of modernisation, newness and image.\" Either way, the scene is set for a campaign which is likely to turn dirty. </p> <p>Too much is at stake, and too many voters floating, to be otherwise. The election is not due until April 2001 but the battle is already turning hot. Rutelli has enlisted Stan Greenberg, the American campaign guru who advised Bill Clinton, Tony Blair and Gerhard Schr\u00f6der and was the alleged mastermind of Al Gore's uxorious kiss at the Democratic convention. \"We will have a few surprises for Mr Berlusconi,\" smiled the mayor. </p> <p>The Queen became a pawn last week. After being greeted by Rutelli in Rome it was vital to the opposition for their man to get a chance to bask in regal glory, which he did in Milan. The jostling for front row seats in St Peter's square will be intense next month when Pope John Paul II proclaims Sir Thomas More the patron saint of politicians. Recent photo opportunities have shown both candidates replicating famous Benito Mussolini images of harvesting crops and embracing children. Commentators are divided over whether the echoes were intentional. </p> <p>Berlusconi, 64, who has a tight rein on his coalition, has successfully presented the myriad corruption allegations against him as judicial witch-hunts. He launched his campaign this month with a billboard blitz which has papered Italy blue. \"More pensions for everybody,\" says the caption, beneath a tanned, beaming visage which appears to be from 15 years ago. \"More hair for everybody,\" sniggers the government. </p> <p>Estimated to be worth $13bn, the owner of AC Milan football club returned from his Bermuda holiday home with 25 \"recipes\" for a better future involving jobs, tax breaks and crackdowns on illegal immigration. Cheered on by his three TV stations and publishing empire, he has brushed aside criticisms that such power will present conflict of interest issues if he is elected. The man who brought soap operas and show girls to Italian TV always appears sunny. He stops smiling only when denouncing his opponents as \"child-eating communists\". </p> <p> Family and yacht complete the image. His 34-year-old daughter Marina, vice-president of his holding company Fininvest, posed in a black bikini for the lifestyle magazine Oggi while the accompanying text praised her physique and brains. Kristen Pazik, the girlfriend of Berlusconi's son Pier Silvio, 31, posed nude for an eight-page spread in Italy's GQ magazine. Her potential father-in-law was the most fascinating man in the world, she revealed. Flaunting wealth is a calculated gamble to appeal to Italian aspirations. </p> <p>The man the media call the Cavalier intends to replicate the tactics which won him last April's regional election. A 37,000-tonne cruiser ship, renamed the Ship of Freedom, was backed up with a fleet of planes and vehicles. Berlusconi instructed canvassers to carry sweets to ward off bad breath, a handkerchief to dry their hands and to always clean public lavatories after use in case voters thought they had dirtied them. \"Make sincere compliments to people. Tell the ladies, 'what a lovely smile, what elegance'.\" </p> <p>He is competing with Rutelli for floating centrist Catholics. \"Anti-communism is a moral duty,\" he has repeatedly said. \"We have two candidates fighting a presidential-style campaign, just like Blair and Hague, but without a cohesive two-party system behind them. They do not have fully developed manifestos on which people can judge them, so image becomes more important,\" says James Walston, of the American University of Rome. </p> <p>Flashes of dirty tricks are a taste of what is likely to come, says Prof Walston. Branded an abortionist and derided by Berlusconi allies for adopting an Ecuadorean child, Rutelli has reminded voters that the Cavalier has been married twice. Oblique references to sexuality have been made. </p> <p>Today's press conference in Milan, his opponent's heartland, is a typically bold move but Rutelli has a mountain to climb. Fractious and unwieldy, the ruling coalition surprised itself by managing to agree on a new name: \"The Olive Tree Together for Italy\". Not quite as snazzy as Berlusconi's House of Liberty. But it's Rutelli's job to make up for that. He will spend the next few months traversing Italy in a bus trying to build momentum. Sitting in his office in Rome, he looks sad for a moment. \"We don't have a boat.\"</p>",

  "Here is a political mystery worthy of Sherlock Holmes at his best. Why was Al Gore found in the library on Saturday with a dagger in his back? <p>An average of four polls taken after Tuesday's debate showed him a possibly mortal four points behind Bush. But pretty well everybody, including the Bushites, agrees that in the crucial debate in the \"show-me\" state of Missouri, Gore did a much better job on the issues than Bush. Gore showed that he had mastered the details of his budget - and also that he had a better grasp of the cost of Bush's proposals than Bush himself. Bush explained to Reuters his idea of what budgeting is all about: \"It's clearly a budget,\" he said, \"it's got a lot of numbers in it.\" </p> <p>A debate question that should have been a home run for Bush, every bit as decisive as David Justice the same evening hitting a home run for the Yankees, was from a 30ish woman who wanted to know how the rival tax policies would affect her. Bush told her we needed a stronger military. Come again? Well, somewhere in an irrelevant rambling answer there was a vague reference to his plan to cut taxes across the board, but the bewilderment of the woman was shared by everyone. A little later he stumbled into the realisation that his partial privatisation of social security would take $1 trillion from future retirees, a key voting constituency. </p> <p>The spear carriers in the press for Bush agree that he does not have the right answers, but now say that doesn't matter. The play is that Bush is really that older governor from California and people love him for his cozy woolliness just as they loved Reagan. It's a switch sale. It is true Bush still scores higher on likeability, but that is not enough to explain the contradiction between voting intentions and judgments on brainpower and policies. American voters may not be the most attentive in the world, but they also kick the tyres when offered a \"great deal\" at the used car lot. </p> <p>So why did Gallup/CNN/USA Today, for instance, give Bush a 10-point lead in voting intention, but report that most of these same people scored Gore 6% ahead of Bush on policies and nine points ahead on clarity of expression? The clue to the mystery, as in the Hound of the Baskervilles, is the dog we don't hear barking. Nobody at the national level has an ear to something that is happening in millions of homes across this vast country. It's this: when families sit down in front of the television, they are assailed and wooed night after night, hour after hour, by the most momentous political advertising campaign in history. So far Bush has spent $120m and Gore only $60m. \"Only!\" </p> <p>This advertising blitz, from the richer party, with more support from business, makes a farce of elective democracy, but it is only a Republican revenge for what the Democrats did to them in 1996 when Bill Clinton routed Bob Dole to win a second term. Nobody noticed in the early summer of 1996 that the Democrats were spending advertising millions unconventionally early. The Clinton campaign kept the scale of their spending secret. They concentrated the investment outside the media capitals of New York and Los Angeles. Neither the press or the Republican party caught on until it was too late. </p> <p>The scale of the Bush advertising campaign is one thing. The other is the cleverness of its disinformation. Ordinary people watching may well believe that the Gore they saw is really \"Gore-gantuan\" who secretly has plans to raise federal spending more than any president since Johnson's Great Society. They are being misled. As a percentage of national income, the only meaningful standard, Gore promises to reduce federal spending. Another scare ad says he will spend three times as much as Clinton envisaged in 1992. Again, it is not true. </p> <p>The most outrageous telly-con of all is the one that states Gore's prescription drug plan will subjugate senior citizens to the dreaded health management organisations which may overrule doctors. In fact, Gore relies on the government's respected fee-for-service Medicare programme. It is Bush who intends to create pressure on older folk to join managed care plans. But who will brief the couch potatoes? </p> <p>What is really at stake in this election is not so much this or that social security plan. It is the future of American democracy. All the barriers to control the insidious influence of money are down. If Gore wins, there will be reform. He has said he will make the McCain-Feingold campaign finance bill his first priority. Bush refuses to commit. Why should he? Money is working for him. He has made his position perfectly clear - in Bush-speak: \"I do not agree with this notion that somehow if I go to try to attract votes and to lead people toward a better tomorrow somehow I get subscribed to some - some doctrine gets subscribed to me.\" Work that one out, my dear Watson. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Last year Ted Owen put out a call through Stoke-on-Trent's local paper, the Sentinel, for people to come forward and stand for the council. At a social event attended by Martin Bell, the independent MP for Tatton, several interested hopefuls gathered from which nine candidates emerged. In May, when 20 of the council's 60 seats were up for grabs, they all stood and all won, taking eight seats from Labour and one from the Conservatives. The independents number 15, the second largest group in the council, with as many seats as the Tories and Liberal Democrats put together. <p>\"It was a kick against the system,\" says Owen, the leader of the independent group. Owen is a former Labour councillor who was deselected because \"he wouldn't toe the line\" and has stood and won as an independent ever since. He puts the victories down partly to a local revolt against the history of one-party rule in a city where Labour once held all the seats. \"It was a reaction against the old-boy network and everything that was going on behind closed doors. Not enough people knew what was going on. They wanted things opened up,\" he says. And he puts the victories down partly to a general disaffection with Labour. \"They were angry about the pensions in particular but also the general arrogance of them in parliament. Most, but by no means all, of our support comes from former Labour voters.\" </p> <p>But if the people of Stoke were kicking against the system, they were swimming with the tide. Their decision to turn their backs on the established parties en masse illustrates a growing divergence between the political class and the prevailing political culture which it is supposed to reflect. It is a dissonance characterised not so much by a clash between left and right - although it is informed by it - but between the margins and the mainstream, which finds its expression in various forms. In Birmingham, where the Justice For Kashmir party has five council seats, it is essentially ethnic. In Preston, where three independent councillors have joined the hard-left Socialist Alliance, it is ideological. If the rural areas continue to bust while the rest of the country booms, it could soon be geographic - a rural party standing against the perception of metropolitan domination of politics. </p> <p>It is not a trend confined to Britain. In Denmark, all the mainstream parties, unions and business representatives pushed for a Yes vote in the euro referendum. The people voted No. Nor is its progress uniform. In Switzerland, a recent referendum over whether to limit immigration united the political and economic establishment against the proposal. The people backed them. </p> <p>But it is gathering pace. In America more than a third of the electorate was too busy or uninterested to vote in 1996 - more than double the figure in 1980. It is little wonder when membership of the political class there is beginning to look hereditary. The Republican presidential candidate, George Bush, is running for the job his dad used to have while his Democrat counterpart, Al Gore, has already filled his father's shoes as a Tennessee senator. They are drawing from a gene puddle of leadership talent confined not to national politics but extending to civil rights, trade unions and municipal government. Martin Luther King III (the head of the Southern Christian leadership conference), James Hoffa (the head of the Teamster union), and Richard Daley (the mayor of Chicago) occupy the same positions as their fathers a generation ago. If the low viewing figures for the presidential debates are anything to go by, the turnout for this year's election could be even lower. </p> <p>But this marginalisation does not stop at electoral politics. The uprisings in Seattle, Prague and Washington, the fuel protests and attacks on \"paedophiles\" in Portsmouth are all, in their own very different ways, examples of what happens when people are either unwilling or unable to access the levers of power to effect change that is both democratic and meaningful. </p> <p>This is not the product of some vast conspiracy but a confluence of factors which have over the past few decades gradually rendered mainstream politics irrelevant to many and remote to most. As larger parties have dumped their ideological baggage and started travelling light, there is often little apart from their rhetoric to distinguish them. </p> <p>Globalisation has further eroded distinctions by giving the invisible hand of the market - in the guise of the World Bank, IMF, multinational corporations and supranational bodies - carte blanche to pick up any democratically elected government by the scruff of the neck and slap it around if it attempts to put the needs of its electorate above the interests of international capital. With traditional electoral bases dwindling - women in call centres where men used to be in mines, rural communities full of commuting townies - the centre-left and right flounder for messages that reach beyond the shrinking faithful to the amorphous centre beyond. </p> <p>Into the vacuum has stepped a mixture of charismatic individuals, extremist organisations and unpredictable politics. In Stoke, the independent councillors selected themselves, with no ideological unity apart from the fact that they did not represent political parties. For all Owen knew, they could have been fascists or members of religious cults. He took them on a hunch. \"You take on board what you see,\" he says. \"But I admit that what you see is not always what you get.\" </p> <p>The trouble with this is that it could go anywhere. The main beneficiaries thus far have been the far-right. J\u00f6rg Haider's support in Austria is thanks in no small part to the cosy, corrupt collusion between the two principal mainstream parties that persisted mostly uninterrupted for almost half a century. Similarly, in Denmark it has been the far-right Danish People's party, which has gained most from the No vote. But the left has made notable inroads too. In London it was Ken Livingstone who took the capital with neither party machine nor personal wealth, but record, personality and profile. </p> <p>The reaction of the mainstream has so far been organisational rather than political. Rather than address the issues of internal democracy, political alienation or economic exclusion that have created the conditions for marginalisation they have simply closed ranks. It is an attitude best illustrated by the reaction of the Belgian premier, Guy Verhofstadt, to the strong showing of the far-right Vlaams Blok, which won a third of the votes in Antwerp city elections earlier this month. \"All the democratic parties have pledged not to form alliances with the Vlaams Blok. Due to the attitude of other parties it is doomed to disappear in the long run.\" </p> <p>Nothing could be further from the truth. It is because of their attitudes that the Vlaams Blok is flourishing. It is the politically complacent and ideologically vacuous mainstream that is creating the politically aggressive and ideologically chaotic margins that veer between the reactionary and the radical - at times striving to preserve the democracy that is left, at others committed to erasing it.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:gary.younge@theguardian.com\">gary.younge@theguardian.com</a></p> <p>Useful links: <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/austria\">Special report: the Austrian far right in power</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/\">Special report: the US elections</a></p>",
  "Hugo Young is quite right to draw attention to the importance for American democracy of television debates between presidential candidates (Comment, October 19). Sadly, in Britain debates between the party leaders have always been seen as a matter of party advantage, rather than as a democratic obligation. There is a sort of \"winners veto\" at work, in which the party most likely to win refuses a debate on the grounds that it has everything to lose from it. <p>Labour is currently dragging its feet on the issue, but in the past the Conservatives have done the same. Ironically, in the next election Labour may have more to gain from such a debate than its rivals, because Labour supporters appear less likely to vote than those of the other parties.

Having been excluded, along with other third-party representatives, from taking part in the debates, Green party candidate Ralph Nader was also barred from entering the premises where they were being held, despite holding a pass.</p> <p>Mr Young accuses debate-shy Tory and Labour leaders, past and present, of hiding \"behind pretended concern about what to do with the Liberal Democrat\". But what about the Scottish Nationalist, the Green, the Socialist etc? The London mayoral election illustrated how the media over here responds to non-mainstream candidates - just ignore them and hope they go away.<br> <b>Michael Strang</b><br> London</p> <p>\u0095 We vote for an MP, a party and its policies, not a president. Nor have we the checks on presidential power which the American constitution provides. It is true that prime ministers now behave like presidents, using a tame parliament and cabinet to rubber-stamp their decisions. The results are autocratic and capricious government, ill-considered decisions (the poll tax, the Dome), a culture of patronage and a stifling of serious debate at all levels.<br> <b>Mark Holmstr\u00f6m</b><br> Norwich</p>",
  "More than 150 years after California was lost by Mexico to the United States, the state is to become a battleground again. But this time the bombardment will be conducted over the television airwaves as George W Bush digs into his war chest and claims that the greatest prize in the presidential race is within his grasp. <p>The Golden State is indeed the richest trophy in the battle for the White House. It brings the victor 54 electoral college votes out of the total of the 270 needed - as many as the three key states of Florida, Michigan and Wisconsin put together. </p> <p>At the last election, Bill Clinton carried California comfortably with 51% of the vote to Bob Dole's 38%, Ross Perot's 7% and Ralph Nader's 2%. </p> <p>Local polls have shown Mr Gore comfortably ahead but now the Bush team has announced that its private polls show the gap to be as small as 6% and they are to spend $1.5m (\u00a31m) a week on commercials in the final stretch of the campaign. The Texas governor will also be hitting the state to try to motivate the undecided. </p> <p>In addition, a national Bush campaign in Spanish will be seen as directed very much at California where 25% of the population of 31m is now Latino, traditionally regarded as Democratic supporters. </p> <p>\"The polls definitely reflect a shift from Gore and his lead is now only in single digits,\" said Lindsey Kozberg of the California Bush/Cheney 2000 campaign. \"We are finding that California voters are very much attracted to Governor Bush's educational programme and also to his reform of social security and Medicare and his policy on the defence industry.\" </p> <p>She said that the polls over the last week indicated a definite swing to Bush which now meant that a state that had been virtually written off as Democrat two months ago was now seen as worth courting, particularly as it last went Republican in 1988 for George Bush Sr. </p> <p>At the Democrats' California campaign offices, the mood is sanguine. \"We welcome their decision to waste money here in California,\" said spokesman Peter Ragone. </p> <p>\"The reason he will not win in California is that he is in the hip-holster of the National Rifle Association,\" he said. \"Our message to Bush is 'keep the mess in Texas not in California'.\" He added that Al Gore's record on the environment was one key factor in ensuring that the state would remain with the Democrats. </p> <p>Commentators doubt whether Mr Bush has a serious chance and see the push as strategic, aimed at keeping up the percentage of the Republican vote, aiding Republicans running for office in the Senate and Congress and having a psychological impact on the Gore campaign in that it creates an impression nationally that, if California is vulnerable, then Gore must be in real trouble. </p> <p>California is also one of the states where Mr Nader, the Green party candidate, would hope to do well but he is still hovering at around 5% in the polls as more and more left-leaning organisations and publications urge a Gore vote for fear of a Bush victory. </p> <p>Californians have good reasons for going to the polls that involve neither Mr Bush nor Mr Gore. Two propositions concerning drugs and schools have activated many voters and the spin-off may be a higher turnout than usual that may have national repercussions. </p> <p>Proposition 36 is a radical move that would mean that non-violent drug offenders who were neither selling nor manufacturing drugs would be given treatment and probation instead of prison. This is opposed by the prison guards' union who have found an unlikely ally in the normally liberal actor Martin Sheen, currently enjoying great success as the fictional president in the television series West Wing. </p> <p>Sheen, whose son had drug problems, argues that only the threat of prison works and has been appearing on commercials to call for a No vote. The other contentious proposition, 38, would introduce a school voucher system that would allow parents to take $4,000 (\u00a32,750) worth of vouchers to the private school of their choice, thus removing their child from the state system. </p> <p>What worries some candidates is the sheer number of votes people are asked to cast with 32 different choices for a voter to make in Los Angeles alone. An indication of the constituencies to which candidates must appeal is reflected in the number of languages printed on the ballot: Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Tagalog, Vietnamese and Spanish. </p> <p>Spice has been added to the presidential race by the opening last week of the film The Contender, starring Joan Allen and Gary Oldman. Allen plays a strong and honourable Democratic vice-presidential candidate and Oldman an unattractive and creepy Republican at odds with each other over allegations of sexual high jinks. </p> <p>The film, which was re-edited by DreamWorks, whose founders are all big Democra tic party supporters, has been accused of being a political commercial for the Democrats timed to hit the voters subliminally just as they make up their minds about voting.</p>"
