  "Tonight sees the first televised debate between the two main candidates in the the US presidential elections. <p>The Republican contender, George W Bush, needs to do well in the 90-minute debate if he is to continue his recovery from a slump in the opinion polls. He will want to avoid any slips of the tongue, which may reinforce his opponents' claims that he is not intelligent enough to be president.</p> <p>Mr Bush's Democrat rival, Vice-President Al Gore, will aim to regain his lead in the polls. He will have been advised to refrain from interruption and over-aggressive attacks on Mr Bush.</p> <p>The opening in Boston of the three Gore-Bush debates will set the tone for the rest of the series of head-to-head debates: in North Carolina on October 11, and in St Louis on October 17. </p> <p>Mr Bush has more to prove, and an extra burden to bear. His stumbles with words and syntax - something his father also did as president - would hurt under the glare of the debate lights and cameras. He cannot afford to provide late-night TV comedians with more opportunities for mockery. The governor of Texas has to show the nation he is a candidate of presidential standing and bearing, in style and in substance. </p> <p>After eight years as vice president, Mr Gore faces different problems. He has skillfully claimed a hand in shaping the thriving economy while avoiding the taint of President Bill Clinton's personal misconduct and of allegations surrounding his own fund-raising in the 1996 campaign.</p> <p>Mr Gore has been at this longer. He ran for president in 1988, and in 1992 and 1996, debated his vice-presidential rivals, displaying a quick-hit style with opening quips that carried a barbed edge. </p> <p>Against an incumbent nominee in good economic times - usually a sign that the party in power will stay there - the Republican challenger cannot afford to drop any weapon in the campaign arsenal. </p> <p>But Mr Gore's side worries that too much will be expected of the vice president, and that Mr Bush will benefit just by holding his own. To serve that purpose, Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes called Gore \"the best debater in politics today\". But she could not resist a shot to the contrary, calling him robot-like.</p>",

  "Some 11 years ago, a woman called Lori Griffin checked herself into a hospital in Charleston, South Carolina, complaining of premature labour pains. Instead of receiving treatment she was handcuffed and shackled, put in a wheelchair and whisked off to jail. Her urine had tested positive for cocaine and she was charged with passing drugs to a minor - her unborn child. <p>On Wednesday the case will arrive at the US Supreme Court, which will consider whether the hospital had the right to test Griffin, and nine other plaintiffs, without their consent. On the face of it, it is a matter of privacy and the authorities' right to conduct searches on suspicion of a crime.</p> <p>But it is about much more than that. It is a case that straddles the fault lines in US society because it pits the rights of women against the rights of their unborn children. There are other issues in this election year which will decide more votes, but none that will arouse deeper emotions. If the Supreme Court rules on the side of the unborn child, the road may be paved towards a reversal of Roe v. Wade, the landmark case guaranteeing women the right to an abortion.</p> <p>In the late 1980's, the hospital administrators in South Carolina were facing a tide of crack addiction. Robert Hood, a South Carolina lawyer involved in the hospital cases said there were: \"Pathetic situations, where the babies were born dead, mothers had abrupted placentas and almost died. And there weren't one or two of them, there were hundreds of them. It was going on all over the United States. And, in fact, in '89, it was an epidemic.\"</p> <p>So the doctors and nurses began to carry out surreptitious urine tests on high-risk maternity patients. At first, women who tested positive were simply arrested. Later on, in 1990, they were offered the choice of treatment or arrest, but women's rights campaigners say forcing women into treatment is no way of curing them of addiction. Furthermore, basic constitutional rights to privacy, which prevent the government from carrying out illegal searches, are at stake.</p> <p>Susan Dunn, the women's lawyer argued: \"It's un-American. It is an abuse of power. It is coercion and control. It is turning a health-care practitioner who is there to build a healthy alliance with their patient for health, and turning that person essentially into a tool of the state, who's in a position to say, 'You do what I want you to do or I'm going to have you arrested.'\"</p> <p>The lawyers on the other side of the case argue that the woman's right to privacy cannot entirely outweigh the basic rights of the child, and as these cases where the pregnancy had entered its last three months, the foetus was a fully fledged child before the law.</p> <p>\"It can't be an unreasonable search and seizure when the government interest is so profound to protect maternal health, to protect the health of the unborn child, when the magnitude of the invasion is so small, because you're already in a medical setting,\" said Doug Kmiec, a constitutional lawyer from the conservative Pepperdine University.</p> <p>The case is not only a proxi for the ongoing conflict over abortion. It is also tinged with race. The decision to test for crack cocaine inevitably targeted black women, because crack is the cheap, highly addictive drug of the urban ghettoes. Civil rights advocates argue it would make more sense to test for alcohol or tobacco, which are more widespread and can be as damaging to the foetus. </p> <p>The simple reason, say South Carolina's supporters, is that alcohol and tobacco are not illegal, so it would be impossible to gain court backing to search for traces of them.</p> <p>Whoever wins the case, it will be a sharp reminder that Supreme Court has become the arena for some of the most visceral debates in US society, and it's make-up is therefore highly-politicised. At the moment there is a 5-4 conservative majority on the bench, but with retirements looming, the next president will probably be able to choose up to three Supreme Court judges. It is one of the great prizes of this election.</p>",
  "Russia is set to clash with the US and Britain at the UN security council this week after confirming it is to revive its scheduled flights to Iraq. <p>Britain and the US regard the Russian move as breaching the sanctions regime imposed against the Iraqi president, Saddam Hussein, for trying to take over Kuwait and starting the 1990-91 Gulf war. </p> <p>A Russian spokesman tried a different interpretation yesterday, claiming commercial flights were not covered by UN resolutions against Iraq. </p> <p>Scheduled passenger flights between Moscow and Baghdad would drive a hole through the crumbling sanctions regime and encourage President Saddam to continue to defy the west. </p> <p>There have been individual flights from Russia and France in the last month, but scheduled flights would be a big change. </p> <p>Iraq's minister for transport, Ahmed Murtada Ahmed Khalil, on a visit to Iran yesterday, disclosed that Aeroflot, would be resuming commercial flights in a fortnight. </p> <p>He asked the Iranian government to allow the Russians to use its airspace, according to the Iranian news agency, Irna. </p> <p>An Aeroflot spokeswoman had said in Moscow earlier in the day that the 51% state-owned carrier intended to resume flights to Iraq. It had signed a memorandum of understanding with Iraqi Airways, she said, but gave no indication at that point of when the service would start. </p> <p>In London, a Foreign Office source said last night: \"The resumption of scheduled flights amounts to a resumption of trading relations, and that would be a breach of sanctions.\" </p> <p>As well as trying to shore up the sanctions regime, the US and Britain also send their warplanes over northern and southern Iraq, denying air space to Iraqi fighters. </p> <p>The resumption of Russian commercial flights would complicate an already tense and dangerous situation. </p> <p>Both Russia and France - eager to do business with Iraq - have tried at the UN to persuade the US and Britain to end the no-fly zones, set up after Baghdad cracked down on northern Iraq's Kurds and southern Iraq's Shi'ites following the Gulf war. </p> <p>A Russian spokesman in London defended the decision to resume flights: \"According to our point of view, nothing in the resolution of the security council forbids it.\" </p> <p>A British-inspired resolution was passed at the UN security council last December holding out the possibility of a compromise over sanctions but Baghdad has rejected it. The new move by Russia, the country's London spokesman said, should be taken as a signal that the world community must act to overcome this impasse: \"We have to do something.\" </p> <p>The US and Britain have become increasingly isolated this year. While the international community feels repugnance towards President Saddam, there is also a growing sense that sanctions and the no-fly zone are hurting civilians rather than the regime. </p> <p>Britain has shown signs of wilting but the US, especially in a presidential election year, has remained resolute. </p> <p>Opponents of sanctions claimed that the US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, who was in Paris yesterday, threatened France that any country flying to Iraq would be denied the right to fly to the US. A Russian source said he had heard of such a threat but dismissed it as \"rhetoric\". </p> <p>In Cairo, the Syrian president, Bashar Assad, and the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, were asked whether they were considering resuming flights to Iraq, following the lead of France, Russia, Yemen and Jordan in challenging the UN sanctions by sending individual flights styled as humanitarian. Mr Mubarak said that if there was private sector interest, his government would not object.</p>",
  "<p>Warning: There is a very real risk of the UK business environment turning into a state of information paranoia. The government may promise to deliver transparent and open management of the economy, but we in the internet sector are seeing a probing and increasingly secretive establishment. </p> <p>People automatically switch off when they see that the regulation of investigatory powers (Rip) bill relates to computer communications. This attitude seems to be reflected in the House of Commons, where only 40 or so MPs bothered to turn up for the bill's second reading. For the third reading there were only 30. The only decent debate took place in House of Lords. </p> <p>The bill states clearly that: \"Emails can be intercepted for the purpose of safeguarding the economic wellbeing of the UK.\" One could therefore assume that the bill will enhance the economic \"health\" of our country. Quite the contrary is, in fact, true. This rushed and rather sketchily defined piece of legislation will make the UK a less attractive location for the headquarters of international companies. </p> <p>This bill has a somewhat conspiratorial and Big Brotherly edge to it. Take the recent BMW Longbridge affair. It was definitely in the UK's economic interest to keep the car manufacturing plant open. Under Rip legislation the government could have intercepted BMW's electronic communications between Germany and the UK. Economic fairplay? I don't think so. I doubt if foreign investors would either. This legislation is giving global businesses a major disincentive to deal with the UK. </p> <p>The business community is also concerned about a clause in Part 3 of the bill, which sets out the remit for the \"notice of disclosure requirements\", whereby senior members of a company are required to allow government agencies access to encrypted communications through the submission of an \"encryption key\". These notices must be served to a senior member of the company, that is the company director or secretary. According to the bill this person can be prosecuted if he reveals the details to anyone, and could receive a jail sentence of up to five years. If a director can be imprisoned for tipping off fellow board members of the notice, this has serious corporate governance implications. It makes it illegal to tell someone what the government has required you to do. I see the need for more balanced investigatory powers for fraud, terrorism or sex crimes, which this legislation also tries to address. </p> <p>Of concern is the possibility to interrogate computer systems of perfectly legal companies.Other countries have learnt to adapt. In Singapore the government has carried out a complete U-turn on the issue of encryption of electronic communications. Just a year ago all business emails in Singapore came through government-owned servers. Now all barriers on the import of cryptographic equipment have been lifted. Singapore is an extremely attractive location for regional offices, global headquarters, or for use as a main communications hub for internet connectivity. </p> <p>Parts 1 and 2 of the legislation are now law, but part 3 is not expected to be enforced until late 2001. A period of six to eight weeks \"consultation\" between government and industry will be announced before this. I urge everyone to review this legislation and to make their views known. </p> <p>\u0095 Richard Latham is chief executive officer of Bluewave, an online creations company based in the UK</p>",
  "William Hague's belated efforts to reposition the Tories inside the \"mainstream majority\" of British politics in time for the general election took a Bournemouth conference beating yesterday from the left and right of the party and its grassroots activists. <p>Although the former prime minister John Major used a rare public speech to chivvy his successor as Tory leader towards consensus, understanding and multiracial \"inclusivity\", the unkindest cut on the opening day of the party conference was grassroots apathy towards Mr Hague's \"mini-manifesto\" ballot. </p> <p>Just 50,508 - 16.67% - of eligible members bothered to vote to endorse the mini-manifesto, \"Believing in Britain\", the Tory chairman, Michael Ancram, was forced to admit after an opening speech to the conference which claimed that the tide has turned decisively against Tony Blair. </p> <p>\"We know and, more importantly, our opponents know, that we can win,\" insisted Mr Ancram, savaging Mr Blair as a cynical liar who had fatally disappointed voters. </p> <p>In a speech to beleaguered Tory moderates last night Mr Major also itemised alleged Labour deceptions - from Kosovo and the economy to \"fibs about pensions\" - to argue that Blairism is a mixture of self-delusion and \"one of the most unscrupulous spin machines Britain has ever seen\". </p> <p>But he also warned that, to win an election, middle England's votes were not enough. \"We must reach out to all, the people in the slums, the people in need, the people outside the circle of rising prosperity, the black and brown and yellow Britons who are as much a part of our society as I am,\" Mr Major said. </p> <p>In the scramble towards the centre ground he will not be alone this week in asserting: \"We are the party that stands for one nation...a Tory who believes that consensus and understanding the point of view of others is a strength and not a weakness.\" Such talk contrasted sharply with cheers for \"quit Europe\" sentiments on the conference fringe. </p> <p>With the party's right wing now dominant in policy-making, the pro-Europe ex-minister Ian Taylor also warned against \"picking policies off the shelf\". More surprisingly, he was joined by another exile from the Hague shadow team, the rightwing MP David Davis. At a Guardian fringe meeting he spoke against over-reliance on focus groups and \"corrosive\" populism. </p> <p>After Labour's brief collapse in the post-fuel-crisis polls the Conservative leadership has persuaded itself it can win the expected May election after all. Like George W Bush, the Republican candidate for US president - whose tactics the Tories closely monitor - Mr Hague is keen to sound more compassionate as polling day looms. </p> <p>But the concentration on reconsolidating the core Tory vote - scattered in the 1997 landslide - with rightwing populist tactics for most of the past year has left Mr Hague too far from the centre ground where most elections are won. </p> <p>Claiming that Conservatives have answers, where Labour has only empty gestures, Mr Ancram used his keynote speech to address the problem head-on. \"This is our chance to show that, far from the shores of extremism upon which our opponents seek to place us, we are the party of the mainstream, sharing the values of the mainstream majority of this country,\" he said. </p> <p>Popping up all over the conference complex yesterday, Mr Hague himself joined in with an attack on the arrogant \"metropolitan elite\" which he said dominated New Labour thinking at the expense of rural Britain. He had already launched the new party policy for revitalising inner cities, building a more privatised structure on what have become Labour policies.</p>",
  "President Slobodan Milosevic issued a defiant challenge to his political enemies yesterday, dubbing the Serb opposition attempting to topple him from power as western lackeys who would lead the country into war and poverty. <p>In his first televised address to the nation since the disputed presidential election on September 24, Mr Milosevic insisted that he had no intention of admitting defeat. Yugoslav officials have called a run-off vote for Sunday, which the opposition says it will boycott because his challenger Vojislav Kostunica won outright in the first round. </p> <p>In his 15-minute address, Mr Milosevic warned that if the opposition took office Yugoslavia \"would inevitably break up\". All opposition plans, he declared, were initiated by Nato and western countries. </p> <p>\"Our policy guarantees peace,\" he said, while the opposition promoted \"clashes and hostility\". Without him Yugoslavia would be \"occupied by foreign forces\". </p> <p>The robust statement came on the day the opposition tried to bring the country to a halt by launching a general strike designed to force him from office. Mr Milosevic will have gained renewed confidence by the fact that the strike failed to take hold, with opposition leaders conceding that the turnout was disappointing. </p> <p>The Yugoslav president accused his opponents of resorting to \"bribing, blackmailing with money from the west\" to bring the country to a standstill. But he said that Yugoslavia's laws would be applied to prevent a \"western invasion\". </p> <p>The defiance from Belgrade ran counter to attempts by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to solve the crisis by calling on Mr Milosevic and Vojislav Kostunica, his main rival, to travel to Moscow this week for talks. </p> <p>Mr Putin's attempt at a negotiated settlement followed a meeting of key Kremlin officials on Yugoslavia yesterday after which the Russian president said the mounting tension in Serbia was turning into a threat to European stability. </p> <p>It was not clear whether Mr Milosevic, in particular, would agree to the Russian offer of mediation. His brother Borislav, the Yugoslav ambassador in Moscow, dismissed all talk of mediation in Belgrade which also reacted negatively at the weekend to a Kremlin offer to send the Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, to Yugoslavia. </p> <p>But with Moscow shifting from being Mr Milosevic's traditional backer to a more even-handed role in the current stand-off while seeking to be the peace broker, Mr Putin is gambling that he can mediate a peaceful handover of power in Belgrade in what would be a triumphant first big foray into international diplomacy and crisis management. </p> <p>While Mr Putin has recognised that Mr Kostunica won last week's election, according to the German government following a telephone conversation between Mr Putin and Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, yesterday's Putin statement, issued while he was en route to India for a four-day visit, also made a nod to the Milosevic camp by talking of a second round. </p> <p>But in the latest of several signals that the Kremlin is distancing itself from Milosevic and discreetly backing Mr Kostunica, one of Mr Putin's closest aides, Sergei Ivanov, the head of the Kremlin's security council, said Yugoslavia needed a legitimate president recognised by \"the world community\". </p> <p>Greece, an Orthodox country like Russia and Serbia, said it was discussing the possibility of helping to organise a recount of the first-round vote with Russia and France, currently in the European Union chair. The renewed Balkan crisis also featured at talks in Paris yesterday between the French government, Madeleine Albright, the US secretary of state, and top EU foreign policy officials.</p>",
  "As the US presidential election enters its final five weeks, the race is again proving that the winner will not necessarily be the man who gives the people what they want. <p>The candidate who is drawing the largest and most enthusiastic crowds is lagging far behind in the polls; the only man with a black running mate is the least popular with black voters; and the one promising what most Americans want is barely registering. All are third-party candidates. </p> <p>Ralph Nader, the Green party contender and veteran consumer-rights campaigner, drew a crowd of 10,000 on Sunday to hear him speak in Boston, following hard on the heels of gatherings of 10,000 in Seattle, 12,000 in Minnesota and 10,500 in Portland, Oregon. </p> <p>Not only are these higher figures mustered by either Al Gore of the Democrats or George W Bush of the Republicans, but they are paying customers, shelling out up to $10 (\u00a36.75) a time to hear the Nader message. </p> <p>Despite the enthusiasm with which he is greeted, despite high-profile support from actors Paul Newman and Susan Sarandon, filmmaker Michael Moore, chatshow host Phil Donahue and some union leaders, Mr Nader is still stalled at around 5% in surveys of public opinion. </p> <p>The Gore team's efforts to persuade liberal America that \"a vote for Nader is a vote for Bush\", the decision by groups such as Friends of the Earth to back Mr Gore for the same reasons, and the lack of a chance to debate with the two main candidates on television are seen as some of the reasons for Mr Nader's low profile. </p> <p>But his team says that the big rallies are bringing in thousands of extra activists, most of them from the 51% of the electorate who usually do not vote. </p> <p>Their fund-raising efforts, often through house parties, have yielded $4m (\u00a32.7m), just enough to run some provocative commercials, but a fraction of what the Gore and Bush camps are spending. </p> <p>\"We get lots of people who say, 'thank God Ralph's running',\" said Peter Stair of Nader 2000. \"You could say that to get 5% of the vote would be one of our benchmarks, but this is part of a continuing movement which will go on far beyond the election.\" </p> <p>Paradoxically, the better Mr Gore does, the bigger chance Mr Nader has of winning votes: if the race between the frontrunners is not seen as not close, Mr Nader's natural supporters may feel more free to back him. </p> <p>Explaining why there were no jokes about Mr Nader, the chatshow host and comedian Jay Leno said: \"Here's a guy, he comes out and tells it like it is. My job's over!\" </p> <p>Mr Nader has reacted to criticism of his lack of past involvement in equality issues by delivering speeches that refer to \"slavery and the genocide of the Native Americans ... the two worst crimes committed in North America\". His running mate, Winona LaDuke, is a Native American academic. </p> <p>His relatively strong standing in key marginal states such as Oregon, Washington and New Mexico have kept him firmly in the Gore camp's sights. </p> <p>The president of Friends of the Earth, Brent Blackwelder, is touring these states on the Democrats' behalf to persuade environmentalists to back Mr Gore, something that has pained the Nader camp deeply. Mr Blackwelder has justified the move by saying: \"We're looking at the reality here. Third-party candidates do not get elected to the presidency.\" </p> <p>Michael Moore, the maverick documentary filmmaker who has been a chief Nader cheerleader, rebutted this argument at the Minnesota rally by asking what would have happened if Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks had also decided to accept the status quo in case things got worse. </p> <p>\"A vote for Nader is a political Molotov - throw it into the voting booth,\" said Moore. </p> <p>But if Mr Nader is having problems capturing the magical double-digit support level, his nearest third-party rivals are floundering in his wake. </p> <p>Pat Buchanan, the renegade rightwing Republican who won the Reform party nomination in a messy battle at its Long Beach convention in August, is barely registering 1% in the polls. </p> <p>The adoption of a black vice-presidential running-mate, Ezola Foster - a supporter, bizarrely, of the far-right John Birch Society, has done little to win Mr Buchanan credibility. His platform is essentially anti-UN, anti-immigration, anti-world trade, anti-abortion and anti-\"Republicrats\", as he now calls the two main parties. </p> <p>Overtaking Mr Buchanan now in states such as Georgia, Illinois and Colorado, is the Libertarian party's Harry Browne, a 67-year-old Tennessee-based investment analyst who also ran in 1996. His message is straightforward and, superficially, extremely appealing to most voters: no more income tax. </p> <p>He also reaches other constituencies with a promise of an end to the \"war on drugs\", believing in a person's right to do what they like in their own home. Mr Browne backs the repeal of all gun-control legislation and the removal of all American troops from foreign countries. </p> <p>But, Mr Nader, Mr Buchanan, Mr Browne and the two other better-known alternative candidates - John Hagelin of the Natural Law party - and Howard Phillips of the Constitutional party - all know their chances of having their voices heard above the sound of the multi-million dollar Gore-Bush battle are slim.</p>",
  "Further claims of illegal practices in Yugoslavia's elections emerged yesterday after a lorry driver alleged that he found ballots for opposition politicians among a load of paper he was transporting for recycling. <p>The driver, who asked not to be named, took a sample of the voting papers to Velimir Ilic, the mayor of Cacak - the town where the pulping factory is based. Last night several of those completed polling slips were shown to the Guardian. They were all genuine. </p> <p>The papers included a white presidential ballot with a vote marked for Vojislav Kostunica, the opposition challenger for the presidency which Slobodan Milosevic is clinging to, despite faring badly in last week's vote. </p> <p>There were also two ballot papers, blue for the House of Citizens and yellow for the House of Republics in the federal parliament; both of these were marked for Mr Kostunica's coalition, the Democratic Opposition of Serbia. </p> <p>The batch included several local election ballot slips, too. One of these contained a vote for the rightwing Radical party. None of the ballots was marked with a vote for Mr Milosevic or his federal coalition. </p> <p>There was also a formal document authorising the bearer to carry ballot papers from a prison to the president of the election committee. This bore two blue original stamps. </p> <p>The material for destruction contained several empty envelopes that would have contained votes from the Yugoslav army. There were large pink envelopes and smaller blue ones. The pink bore the address of the federal or local election committee, depending on what kind of vote was inside. The blue one had three stamps on the back to prove that the envelope had been sealed securely. </p> <p>The date on one envelope was September 23; members of the military often vote before polling day, as the ballots go to the constituencies where the soldier's family is based. </p> <p>For this material to be in the public domain at all at this stage in the election process is illegal: it should still be under lock and key and transported only under escort. Even the used envelopes should be kept and when disposed of later, should be destroyed according to strict rules and procedures. </p> <p>Mr Ilic handed the ballot papers to the television station in Cacak. Its editor-in-chief, Svetlana Kojanovic, then contacted the managers at the Diva recycling plant. </p> <p>\"I spoke to the general manager, Milovan Jovanovic, and two workers and one other manager,\" Ms Kojanovic said. \"The lorry involved was a big truck and they destroyed the contents. But all of them admitted that they had seen ballot papers.\" </p> <p>Mr Ilic, who received the ballot papers from the haulier said yesterday: \"It's stealing votes. It is proven that there has been a lot of stealing.\" </p> <p>Cacak has a reputation as a strongly anti-Milosevic town. The discovery of ballots supporting opposition candidates on their way for recycling quickly added fuel to the anger of people there. Many took to the streets yesterday. </p> <p>\"People do not want to accept cheating and deceit. We have chaos here. We have 30,000 to 40,000 people on the street and an emotional revolt because of the stealing,\" Mr Ilic said. </p> <p>He said some people had gathered outside the tax office and were threatening to destroy it.</p>",
  "A general strike to force Yugoslavia's president, Slododan Milosevic, to concede electoral defeat failed to bring the Serbian republic to a complete standstill yesterday. <p>Opposition strongholds in the provinces lived up to their record of radicalism, but in Belgrade and other major cities workers failed to heed opposition pleas for a boycott. </p> <p>The opposition had urged a countrywide general strike to force Mr Milosevic to concede that his challenger, Vojislav Kostunica, had won an outright victory in the first round of the presidential election on September 24. </p> <p>The state electoral committee ruled last week that Mr Kostunica's share of the vote fell just short of 50% and ordered a runoff next Sunday. </p> <p>In activist towns such as Cacak, Kraljevo, and Kragujevac, roads were blocked, shops shut and businesses closed. But an opposition spokesman conceded that the day's showing was a disappointment. </p> <p>\"Today we particularly failed with this general strike...People in Serbia are not ready yet to boycott everything,\" the spokesman said. </p> <p>Major roads leading to the centre of the capital were blocked during the first few hours after the strike's 5am start. But later they grew busy with buses and trams taking workers to offices and businesses. Staff arrived late, but many went to work. </p> <p>In the afternoon, students disrupted major streets in the heart of the capital. Tens of thousands rallied outside the federal parliament. A crucial intersection was blocked at various times by the students, who blew whistles and horns and waved flags. One group handed in a letter at the army general staff building, calling on the army to stay neutral. </p> <p>Olivera Obradovic, 23, said that she and her fellow students planned to occupy a university building overnight.\"We are trying to inject some enthusiasm and to encourage people to hold on and get this finished - to end this destruction of the country,\" she said. </p> <p>The patchy support in Belgrade was in contrast to the commitment shown by several towns in Serbia's hinterland. The strikers at the Kolubera coal mine complex said they were under enormous pressure, but that they had rebuffed police on Sunday night. </p> <p>\"Everyone is 100% ready to continue the strike,\" a union member, Milovan Jankovic, said. </p> <p>Around 4,500 miners also downed tools at the Kostolac mine in eastern Serbia. They blocked off the mine and power plant but agreed to maintain minimum output. </p> <p>In the opposition-held town of Kraljevo, a journalist, Ljudmila Svetkovic, said that key roads were blocked. Restaurants, shops, buses, state companies - even the local Socialist party television station - were on strike, she said. </p> <p>In nearby Kragulevac, more than 30,000 people took to the streets, including car workers and labourers from the armaments factory. And in Cacak an angry crowd threatened to demolish the tax office. </p> <p>In Mr Milosevic's hometown of Pozarevac, until recently firmly controlled by his allies, farmers blocked roads and the schools were closed.</p>",
  "I feel we know each other well enough for me to say this: I used to sell brushes, door-to-door. It wasn't my fault, I just didn't have many skills. I still don't - typing and trying to sell things that nobody wants would pretty much sum them both up, which makes me ideally fitted to write literary fiction, but who would make their first job something so patently destined for misery and failure? <p>So there I was, pounding the weary streets of Dundee instead, peddling extendable gadgets for reaching awkward spots, ghastly blades to slice and dice and various tubs of gloop, all interchangeably useful for easing, shining and descaling treasured knick-knacks and appliances. It was awful. I knew that my \"customers\" were simply doorstep hostages, that they hated and distrusted me on sight and that if they truly wanted to julienne their vegetables, they'd already be doing it or languishing in some padded facility for having tried. </p> <p>When an elderly couple shuffled lugubriously to their door in what appeared to be a single, conjoined cardigan and murmured that they were too old now and had stopped buying things, it was the final fun-coloured, child-friendly, bendy straw. I could feel something at the base of my brain beginning to liquefy. </p> <p>Apart from all the other humiliations - it made me sweat. I'm not that bad a liar, but even I have standards and foisting dodgy gimmicks on to people who'd done me no harm disagreed with my metabolism. When committing pointlessly unpleasant immoral acts, I perspire distressingly. So you'll understand why I found our noble leader's sweat-sodden address at the Labour party conference unusually fascinating. Why did he end up in such a lather, damply manhandling the wife, while waving a slippery palm to the applauding multitude? Far be it from me to say that foisting or immorality came into it, but did nobody in that august assembly know how a polygraph works, that people tend to get sticky when they lie ? </p> <p> Not that I wouldn't expect the party faithful to remain moderately faithful, especially when they're all at the seaside together having a jolly autumn break. But I was surprised to find that much of the available press coverage saw nothing but signs of admirable manliness and vigour in Tony's patchily drenched shirt. Perhaps the idea of the PM, shivering and dripping like a carthorse at his desk by the end of each parliamentary day, fills the electorate with faith in his endeavours. </p> <p>Then again, America went weak at the knees when it saw Al Gore performing a tongue-tip rearrangement of his lovely other half's vocal chords on national television. A man with saliva to spare is, apparently, a man to trust. And those undoubtedly masculine stains on Monica's little cocktail number didn't do Clinton quite the harm his opponents anticipated. Which leads me to believe that what people actually want from their politicians isn't sincerity, integrity or coherent policies, but generous supplies of body fluids. </p> <p>Think of Robin Cook (I know, I know, but just this once) and you'll see what I mean. The man has a ludicrous voice, all the natural authority of an abandoned Kleenex and a girl's name, but still no one can quite bring themselves to remove him from a position of potentially deadly international influence. Why? Well, I wouldn't want to press my theory too far, but in the absence of any logical explanation, I can only guess that Cook's continuing success might rely on that highly publicised divorce, the affair, the implied exchange of liquids, his perpetual air of vaguely smug moisture. </p> <p>The thought that more and more politicians might dive into this relatively unpaddled pool of opportunity is frankly frightening. And the options still available are not entirely appetising. It is unlikely that Mr Hague, however desperate, will seek to lash his party conference into a frenzy of enthusiasm by wetting himself at key conference high points this week. And I'm certain that Mr Portillo will show no leanings whatever towards watersports of any kind, although he might seek to underline his unswerving devotion to Hague's leadership by, say, projectile vomiting whenever they meet. </p> <p>Other, tried and tested, options are more ugly. Undeniably, many among the British electorate might have spent their adult lives declaring that the Houses of Parliament are packed with hopeless tossers, but would they really want full-frontal proof that this was literally true? Even if it meant the country could sell televised parliamentary sessions to special-interest cable channels all over the world. </p> <p>On the plus side, a public competition to find the best, most washable design for new debating chambers might help dissipate the massive national embarrassment of the dome. As an instinctive reformer, I would prefer to see dedicated parliamentarians underline their points by opening the odd vein. I don't suppose they ever will, but I try to live in hope. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com&quot;\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "One of the apartheid state's most notorious assassins has for the first time linked the former white regime's security forces to a massacre that almost wrecked negotiations to end minority rule <p>Ferdi Barnard, a member of two security-force death squads who is serving a life sentence for murder, yesterday told South Africa's truth and reconciliation commission, which is investigating apartheid crimes, that hitmen gave guns to Zulu hostel-dwellers to carry out a series of massacres. </p> <p>The killings, in townships near Johannesburg, aimed to destabilise the African National Congress during the talks in the early 1990s. </p> <p>The most notorious massacre was eight years ago, when 39 people were slaughtered in their homes in the middle of the night at Boipatong, south of Johannesburg. Barnard said that a few days before these killings he was told that guns were to be given to Zulus in the local hostel for an attack on the ANC. </p> <p>When FW de Klerk, then president, visited the massacre scene, he was chased away by thousands of angry residents. </p> <p>The ANC, which had already put negotiations on hold to protest at the government's complicity in the mounting violence, considered calling off the talks altogether. But that would play into the hands of the killers, it decided, and Boipatong eventually made the ANC more determined to make the negotiations succeed. </p> <p>Government members from the early 1990s have consistently denied that the security forces had any hand in the massacre, but Barnard's testimony will reinforce the widely held belief in South Africa that a \"third force\" played a big role in such killings. </p> <p>He is seeking amnesty for a number of crimes, including the 1989 murder of a prominent academic and human rights activist, David Webster, whom he confesses to killing, and for hanging the foetus of a baboon outside the home of Archbishop Desmond Tutu. </p> <p>Barnard worked for at least two hit squads, the infamous \"civil cooperation bureau\" and the army's \"directorate of covert collections\". </p> <p>Yesterday he also told the commission that the apartheid army had recruited criminals to disrupt ANC rallies in the run-up to the first free election in 1994. </p> <p>\"These things I personally arranged. These were paid out of state funds,\" he said. </p> <p>During a break in yesterday's testimony, the transport minister, Dullah Omar, shook hands with Barnard, who came close to murdering him in 1989. The hitman said he hid in Mr Omar's garage with a gun, but the anti-apartheid activist came home with his wife and Barnard fled. </p> <p>\"I knew I was going to be responsible for Omar's death. I had no doubt,\" he told the commission.</p>"
