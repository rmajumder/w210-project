  "Sir Edward Heath's unbroken survival as an MP, from the age of Atlee to that of Tony Blair, would be enough to earn him a place in British political history. Add to the record four years as prime minister, two spells as leader of the opposition and a crowded case of other jobs from chief whip to the father of the House, and Sir Edward's status is established beyond doubt. <p>That makes his decision to retire from the Commons at the next election, announced this afternoon, a landmark in parliament's evolution, a more interesting event than, say, John Major's similar announcement earlier this year. He is one of the last active connections with a political age which took parliament seriously. Tony Blair is unlikely to clock up five decades in the Commons, and would not hope to do so. The Commons is no longer where it is at.</p> <p>Not that Sir Edward Heath was entirely a parliament man. In the late 1960s his party saw him as a telegenic leader who could challenge Harold Wilson, a break with the slow pace of the previous Conservative party leader, Sir Alec Douglas-Home. As prime minister, Sir Edward became was famous for his addiction to yacht racing. Less well-known is that he took up sailing on the advice of Conservative image makers. </p> <p>And even Sir Edward's time in parliament after his prime ministership had its mysteries: not least his apparently close relationship with the leaders of communist China and the real nature of his views on Margaret Thatcher. </p> <p>That, though, will not prevent MPs from all sides of the house regretting his impending departure. With Sir Edward in his place on the green leather benches, among the Liberal Democrats, the chamber somehow seemed a little more important than it will once he has gone. </p> <p><b>Sir Edward Heath factfile</b></p> <p><b>Born: </b> 9 July, 1916<br> <b>Elected to Parliament: </b> February 1950<br> <b>First political job: </b> Assistant whip, February 1951<br> <b>Chief whip: </b> December 1955, to Anthony Eden<br> <b>Entered Cabinet: </b> October 1959, as minister of Labour<br> <b>Key role: </b> Negotiating entry to the EEC, 1963, as president of the board of trade<br> <b>Party leader: </b> July 1965, replacing Alec Douglas-Home<br> <b>Became prime minister: </b>June 1970, replacing Harold Wilson<br> <b>Key event: </b> Taking Britain into EEC, 1972<br> <b>Defeated: </b> February 1974, in wake of three-day week<br> <b>Defeated once more: </b> October 1974<br> <b>Replaced as leader of the opposition: </b> 1975<br></p>",
  "<p>The Maben-Mead family have been waiting a long time to fly to Australia, but later this week they will finally leave. After a massive fundraising effort, Jill Maben and Robert Mead are taking their eight-year-old son George to Melbourne in the hope that pioneering brain surgery, not currently available in the UK, will remove a rare form of tumour and transform his quality of life. </p> <p>It is certainly not the first time that friends, family and volunteers have rallied round to support an exhausting wave of sponsored walks, jumble sales and raffles in a bid to raise thousands of pounds to cover the costs of \"miracle\" medical treatment on the other side of the world which is not offered by the NHS. American hospitals, in particular, have been marketing themselves aggressively to vulnerable British patients - particularly to candidates for brain-tumour surgery - even though the outcomes on both sides of the Atlantic have been more or less the same. </p> <p>George has a rare benign tumour, known as a hypothalamic hamartoma, deep inside his brain in the region which controls mood, appetite, thirst, sleep and hormones. The little-known condition has given him severe learning and behavioural difficulties, and up to 15 epileptic seizures a day. There is no known cure, apart from complex surgery to remove the tumour - and even that has been largely unsuccessful, under techniques used in Britain. </p> <p>Then, through an international support group on the internet, Jill and Robert learned of pioneering micro-surgery with a high success rate at the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne. With the encouragement of the surgeons they have talked to all 12 of the previous patients, and their son is due to undergo surgery next month. </p> <p>George talks like a four-year-old and cannot read or write. His motor skills are poor, though like many people with autism - another effect of his condition - he has an amazing memory, able to recite parrot fashion all the names of his vast video collection. \"George's quality of life at the moment is already very poor,\" Robert says. \"He has no friends of his own age and no interest at all in going out or meeting other people. His world revolves around his Postman Pat and Disney videos. Without the operation, there is no doubt that his condition would deteriorate further.\" </p> <p>The normal development of George's younger sister Lola, who at 19 months is just saying her first words, makes the pain greater still. Though George attends a special school in Essex, some distance from the family's home in Hackney, east London, looking after him is so demanding that Robert has given up his job in a respite home, and spends much time teaching George in a specially-designed playroom in the family's garden. The couple raised the \u00a316,500 needed for the operation in three months, though they must still raise \u00a33,500 to cover accommodation, travel and other expenses. </p> <p>It took three years before George's condition was diagnosed. He appeared slow to develop, and did not walk until he was 18 months old; his speech, when it came at age two, was largely restricted to single words. The local clinic talked of \"general global delay\", and George was investigated for hearing loss and provided with speech therapy. But it was the first major seizure - in the middle of the night, with three of them in the bed - that sounded the alarm. </p> <p>A scan revealed a tumour, and neurologists at Great Ormond Street hospital in London said the rest of the brain appeared normal. Only then did his parents realise that George's odd, staccato-like cries as a baby - which everyone had called \"cute\" - had actually been minor seizures. </p> <p>George was born with the tumour, which grows at the same rate as his brain and is now up to 2cm across. Its presence causes him to have a very rare form of \"gelastic\" epilepsy which results in 10 to 15 \"laughing seizures\" every day as a result of constant electrical activity. </p> <p>Great Ormond Street told them George's condition was inoperable, and energies were directed towards \"symptom management\", keeping his seizures under control by regular medication. But it was a lonely and difficult time for Jill, herself trained as a nurse, who started extensive research in search of information. \"It was a relief to find that there was something there. But I remember sitting in the British Library and reading about 'cognitive decline' in relation to gelastic epilepsy. It was all extremely depressing.\" </p> <p>Next, Jill turned to the internet, and after several months traced six other families whose children had the same kind of tumour. Without treatment, George's epilepsy would be likely to worsen, possibly even leading to \"drop seizures\", where a person literally drops to the ground and risks serious injury; but with the radical Australian surgery - involving a delicate five-hour operation through a 2cm incision in the top of the head - the tumour will be removed completely and, if successful, will end the seizures while also halting learning decline. </p> <p>By the time the surgeon involved, Professor Jeffrey Rosenfeld, sees George next month, he will have operated on 12 children, all of whom are virtually seizure-free. The most recent surgery was carried out just two weeks ago. </p> <p>Jill admits that her own medical background was a help in researching the operation. \"But one of the most important things for us is being able to communicate with other families via the internet, including the 12 whose children have had the surgery in Australia,\" she says. \"Instead of feeling that we were on our own, it has been great to share the experience with so many other people. And the surgeons even sent us their own CVs. The whole thing has been a very open and transparent process.\" </p> <p>Apart from the fact that techniques used in the UK have a lower success rate - sometimes leading to complications such as strokes - NHS funding restrictions would inevitably have meant a long wait for any surgery here, and Jill and Robert do not have time on their side. \"We would rather take George to Australia where there is a proven track record and increasing experience of this very complex brain surgery and where we can get surgery immediately,\" Jill explains. </p> <p>\"We can't risk a further wait which could lead to further deterioration. There is the prospect of a very complex operation and five hours on the operating table, not to mention 26 hours on the plane, which for George is not going to be easy. This is not something we would do lightly.\" </p> <p>George's neurologist at Great Ormond Street, Professor Brian Neville, has been supportive, though he stops short of recommending the surgery. A spokeswoman for the hospital says: \"We cannot recommend this operation because it is quite a new procedure which has not had any long-term follow up. But the surgical team in Australia is very highly respected, and we fully support the right of the family to make this decision.\" </p> <p>Now, as they wait to leave, Jill and Robert are, understandably, in an emotional state. \"We are experiencing a mixture of excitement and worry,\" Jill says. \"We don't want to raise our hopes too much. But we are quite tenacious. It is the next, and ultimate step in improving George's quality of life. We could wait another five years for the surgery to be refined in this country, but that is an awfully long time in George's life.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Updates of George's progress will be posted on the web at <a href=\"http://www.gap3.com\">www.gap3.com</a>.</p>",
  "On the dubious premise that newspaper endorsements sway public opinion in US presidential campaigns, both main candidates can at least take comfort that they are being supported in print in their home states. <p>No doubt there are pockets of Democrats lurking in Texas, but they are not terribly visible in the local press. An admittedly quick survey indicates solid support for George W. Bush, encapsulated in the admirably crisp endorsement of the <a href=\"http://www.dallasnews.com/\" target=\"_new\">Dallas Morning News:</a> \"The Texas Republican could create a less partisan government, restore integrity to the White House and usher in a progressive-conservative era. Americans should vote for change and select George W. Bush to lead the nation in a new direction.\" </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.mysanantonio.com/\" target=\"_new\">San Antonio Express-News</a> is similarly smitten: \"During his tenure as Texas' chief executive, Gov. George W. Bush has done an excellent job of setting a positive bipartisan tone, an approach that would benefit the nation in Washington. </p> <p>Bush's willingness to work with lawmakers in both parties, and his ability to build a strong governing team make him the best choice for president.\" The <a href=\"http://elpasotimes.com/\" target=\"_new\">El Paso Times</a> is not quite so upfront, but its election coverage leaves little doubt where it's heart lies. So does an indignant reader's letter, which accuses the paper of \"coddling\" Bush, and indeed everyone else wearing a Republican teeshirt. </p> <p>In Tennessee, Al Gore's state, they do things differently, and not many of the newspapers surveyed offer anything as vulgar as a straight endorsement. The marvellously named <a href=\"http://www.timesfreepress.com/\" target=\"_new\">Chattanooga Times and Free Press</a> is an exception: \"Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush have been telling us for some time that this election is about important differences between them. On this point both are right. Mr. Bush proposes a hands-off government that essentially would further enrich wealthier people and give little more than lip service to the needs of ordinary Americans. Mr. Gore actually would roll up his sleeves and work to help Americans take care of their families and improve their education, health care and economic opportunities.\" (Lest this be thought the vapourings of some bleeding-heart liberal rag, the same paper carries a shrill warning that China is preparing for war with the United States.) </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.knoxnews.com/\" target=\"_new\">Knoxville News-Sentinel </a> speaks with the authentic sceptical voice of middle America when it urges voters to think carefully about the lavish promises of education spending by both candidates: \"By the time the Republican Congress finishes caving in to President Clinton, federal spending on education could be close to $43 billion, 20 percent more than last fiscal year. The two major party presidential candidates, Al Gore and George W. Bush, promise to spend even more. Clearly, the political consensus is that federal aid to education is a winning issue, but there is a larger, less obvious issue here that is not being addressed: The extent of federal control over public education, by long tradition a purely local responsibility.\" </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://miva.jacksonsun.com/\" target=\"_new\">Jackson Sun</a>, while keeping its preferences primly to itself, carries ominous news for the local hero.

  "<p>The governor of the Bank of England today warned against any attempt to force down the value of the pound in order to prepare the ground for Britain to join the European single currency. </p> <p>Speaking in Paris, Sir Eddie George said that sterling was still \"substantially overvalued\" against the struggling euro. But he warned that lowering interest rates to try to drive down sterling to a \"more sustainable level\" risked stoking inflation and destabilising the whole British economy. </p> <p>\"Frankly it is not clear to me that this is a risk which would be in the interests of either the UK or the euro-zone to take in today's conditions,\" he said. </p> <p>Sir Eddie, who has in the past expressed reservations about UK joining the euro, went out of his way to praise the single currency, saying it had contributed to strong performance of the euro-zone economies over the past two years. </p> <p>But while he indicated that, at some point in the future, Britain may be able to exist \"relatively comfortably\" as a member of the single currency, with interest rates set centrally by the European central bank, the conditions were not yet right. </p> <p>\"For the time being our best bet, it seems to me, is for both the euro-zone and the UK to continue to pursue macro-economic - both fiscal and monetary - stability in parallel, and to hope that the euro recovers, as I continue to expect that it will,\" he said. </p> <p>\"That strikes me as a more reliable path to the sustainable convergence which the British government has set as the essential economic criterion on which its decision to move ahead to a referendum on UK entry to the euro will be based.\" </p> <p>He admitted that the weakness of the euro remained puzzling, but suggested that it may be linked to the continuing strength of the US economy. </p> <p>\"On the basis of what we do know, it seems unlikely that the euro's weakness in the foreign exchange market is pushed by any obvious macro-economic failure in the euro-zone,\" he said. </p> <p>\"It is much more likely that it reflects the magnetic attraction of the US at present as a destination for long-term investment.\" </p> <p>He said the euro-zone economies had turned in a \"pretty good performance\" since the introduction of the single currency and that much of the media criticism had been \"wholly misplaced\".</p>",
  "A 75-year-old woman who refused to pay a \u00a3360 council tax bill because of a long-running dispute over her garden boundary was yesterday jailed by magistrates. <p>The decision to imprison Mary Rooney, who had to be dragged handcuffed from court by prison officers, angered local people and campaigners for pensioners' rights. </p> <p>Ms Rooney, who lives alone in Smethwick, West Midlands, has waged war on Labour-controlled Sandwell council since 1991, when she lost part of her garden in a dispute with neighbours. </p> <p>Though she has thousands of pounds in savings, she has refused to pay her council tax. Yesterday she told magistrates: \"I am not liable to pay tax on stolen property. If I did pay, I'd be condoning crime in Sandwell.\" </p> <p>Miss Rooney was given a 21-day suspended sentence in January after being found \"culpably negligent\" of not paying her council tax and in the course of three subsequent hearings was ordered to pay \u00a35 a week. </p> <p>Ian Buckingham, representing Sandwell council, said: \"This is the fifth hearing in relation to this particular debt. She has said she will not pay - the reasons are irrelevant.\" </p> <p>Magistrates pleaded with Miss Rooney to take free legal advice from the duty solicitor but she refused. She insisted that her refusal to pay the council tax was \"part and parcel\" of the dispute over her land. </p> <p>In 1994 she had asked for her house to be placed in a lower band because of the loss of part of her garden. The valuer had refused. Consequently, she paid only part of her council tax bill. </p> <p>Yesterday, the chairman of the bench said: \"In a democratic society, we have a duty to ensure payment of council tax so that appropriate services can be provided.\" The court was told Miss Rooney was liable for \u00a3516.70 in council tax and court costs. </p> <p>She was believed to be spending last night at Brockhill prison, near Redditch in Worcestershire. </p> <p>A senior Sandwell councillor, Darren Cooper, branded the jail sentence an \"absolute disgrace\" and called for the Warley MP, John Spellar, to intervene . </p> <p>But the Sandwell cabinet member for finance and resources, cllr Richard Young, said: \"Obviously, nobody here wants to see an elderly woman in this situation and I would rather see her pay than make applications to send her to prison, but she was given every opportunity.</p> <p>\"We are not the villains - if everyone did this then nobody, including elderly people, would get their bins emptied or meals on wheels.\" </p> <p>Mike Allen, the chief executive of Sandwell Age Concern, said:\"This is not helpful to the problems old people may be facing.\"</p>",
  "Tony Blair has never met George W Bush. The newest episode in the Anglo-American relationship, which may begin in a fortnight's time, will get off to a jarring start. Governor Bush was due to tour Europe and Asia last spring, to make himself known to foreign leaders and enrich his image back home. That's what presidential candidates do. But the visits were called off, because Bush's campaign handlers thought they wouldn't help. They feared he would make a fool of himself. Since then, the evidence has accumulated that they were right. <p>For Mr Blair, and therefore for Britain, a Bush presidency offers alarming possibilities. It is true that, when he woke up to the fact that he was president, Mr Bush would probably survey the world and recognise Anglo-London as a first foreign haven. Though knowledgeable about Latin-America, he is ignorant of Europeans, and would be inclined to fall back on the British bonds familiar to George Bush I. </p> <p>But the culture-shock to Mr Blair will be great. He has grown close to Bill Clinton. They talk more often and more equally than any prime minister and president for 50 years, Thatcher-Reagan included. Their brains as well as ideology are a match. The third way, so-called, is a common project, their version of a globalised idea. As well as enjoying exchanges of wonkishness about healthcare or education reform, the two helped each other out of tight corners, and if Al Gore wins, the continuities will be pretty seamless. </p> <p>Mr Bush comes from somewhere else. Though wallowing in a sea of unspecifics, he knows what he doesn't like, and most of it is represented by Clinton-Gore and, by extension, Blair. His biggest pitch is anti-Washington, which means anti-government. He has entered into little policy talk with the American people, so it's a fair bet there would be none with his friends across the ocean. Bush is aggressively uninterested in that way of being a political leader, let alone in the kind of social democratic world that has given several European leaders more useful relationships with Washington than have existed for decades. </p> <p>But that's only the beginning. It is now clear that Bush and his people regard 21st century Europe very differently from the view that prevailed in Washington in the second half of the 20th. They positively desire a greater distancing, especially of the American army. When Bush began to hint at this a few months ago, most of the foreign policy establishment here put it down to campaign talk. The protection of our boys from crazy foreign adventures made useful headlines. Actually we now know Bush has every intention of withdrawing American troops from the Balkans, as part of a philosophy which is working towards an end to interventionism anywhere on any grounds other than US strategic interest. </p> <p>His chief foreign policy adviser, Condoleezza Rice, told the New York Times that \"peace-keeping\" missions would be out, because they were a distraction from America's prime duties in the Gulf and the Taiwan straits. In Europe, there had to be a \"new division of labour\": a statement made, by the way, in apparent ignorance of the fact that Europeans currently supply more than 80% of the peacekeeping force in Bosnia and Kosovo. When Bush's spokesman was challenged with the implications of the new doctrine, he said that the governor was \"100%\" behind what Ms Rice had said. </p> <p>So an unbrave new world beckons, which is likely to destabilise Nato as well as re-positioning Washington's global relationships. American economic dominance will grow and grow, but American responsibilities as the only super-power are set for the kind of drastic re-think that the European left once dreamed of, but which is now more likely to upset our modernised social democratic governments. </p> <p>If the Bush doctrine takes hold for four years, it will pre-empt most of the British argument against Blair's efforts to build Europe's own security. Tory objections to the embryonic Euro-defence force will be emptier than ever - the St Malo agreement that got it under way will look like a singular piece of Anglo-French prescience. But, shorn of major bits of US capability, Nato could look radically different. Forget about more enlargement. Forget about much more peacekeeping. Meanwhile, a unilateral American national missile defence (NMD), pushed through without regard for what allies have to say, grows naturally out of the coming mind-set. One Washington expert, who monitors security issues with an intimate insider's eye, told me he regarded NMD as now certain to be deployed if Bush wins. </p> <p>He will surround himself, of course, with advisers. General Colin Powell is regarded as the prime candidate for secretary of state, and might even be announced as such before November 7, to reel in those voters who look at Governor Bush and see only a dim-witted Reagan without the excuse of being an actor, or the defence of having a simple vision he will cling to. Reagan did have the big idea that he needed to beat the Soviets, a task in which he succeeded. Because of that governing notion, the times accommodated, and even profited from, a leader otherwise unqualified for world leadership, whose purpose everyone could easily figure out. </p> <p>Modern times are different. There is neither big idea nor big challenge: no missile gap, no space race, no evil empire. Foreign policy is the task of building alliances, largely by personal persuasion. A president can't subcontract the task of choosing between advisers whose opinions, however clever, conflict. He has to decide himself, about matters of great complexity. Nor can he cajole allies or persuade Congress except by his own negotiating talents. The hands-off president is not, these days, an option. But the hands-on president needs a set of skills, including an interest in policy detail and a sophisticated alertness to the world, of which George Dubya Bush has shown staggeringly little command. </p> <p>In foreign policy, Congress will be no counter-force to a new era of US-first unilateralism. Internationally, a do-nothing president will meet only the grateful acquiescence of the legislature. On the Hill, the age of internationalism is dead, something Clinton at first did not work hard to repudiate. But in the end he did so. Gore blows the same muted trumpet, and Blair, the liberal interventionist, chimes with him. The new President Bush would be the man who said earlier this year that \"we should not send our troops to stop ethnic cleansing and genocide in nations outside our strategic interest\". His adviser's words about Nato seem just as reckless, but just as revealing. They are not a posture, but a position. They're probably the decided view of a majority of Americans, whose ignorance, however, has until now always had an enemy in the White House. </p>",
  "<p><strong> Life of the mind...</strong> A welcome breeze of high culture this week, as peerlessly erudite novelist and raconteur Gore Vidal flits over from his sun-dappled Italian villa to promote his latest novel The Golden Age (the seventh in his series of American historical epics). In fact, the old boy may well already be in town by the time you read this, what with his appointment to give a lecture at The Royal Geographic Society this evening (billed as Europe And The US: A Small Subject), before signing copies of his opus at Hatchards, Piccadilly on Wednesday night. </p> <p><strong> Notes and queries...</strong> Meanwhile, amid the hullabaloo over Cameron Crowe's forthcoming big-screen rock-hack memoir Almost Famous, there could hardly be a better time to greet the arrival of Greil Marcus, world's greatest rock critic and, in his own, professorial way, a man almost as dapper as Gore Vidal. Pitching up next Monday, Marcus is over plugging his new book (there's a lot of it about) Double Trouble: Bill Clinton And Elvis Presley In A Land Of No Alternatives, and then sticks around until Bonfire Night. </p> <p><strong> The devil has all the best tunes... </strong> Which is by way of explaining that German veterans Faust, among the more impressively demented collectives of the Krautrock era, are over to deliver a live soundtrack to FW Murnau's silent classic, Nosferatu, at the Royal Festival Hall tomorrow night.

  "\u0095 We are delighted to introduce readers to a New Labour chameleon to put even Mr Tony Blair, the lovable leprechaun of political craic, to shame. He is would-be MP Shahid Malik, and his ubiquity is matched only by his imagination. When seeking selection in Preston (he's also tried Brent East, Tottenham, Leeds Central and others), he wrote: \"Although I was brought up in Burnley, I spent much of my teenage years playing snooker at Preston's Royal Snooker Suite.\" Aha. He announces himself as the first black or Asian person to win election to Labour's NEC constituencies section (news to Diane Abbott), and boasts of \"a role in two of our country's defining moments - the Good Friday Agreement and the Stephen Lawrence inquiry.\" And in a glossy leaflet packed with Michael Winner-style poses with Gerry Adams, Mo Mowlam, Baldrick and others, this intriguing Zelig figure reveals: \"I was born in a mining hospital in Burnley\". A what? What a character. Will someone please find him a seat forthwith? <p>\u0095 BBC1's unbearably exciting breakfast show reveals sound editorial judgment. Yesterday Gore Vidal was on, talking about the American election, and they gave him about 90 seconds before interrupting him mid-sentence in favour of bus timetable news or something equally diverting. Brilliant. Although this column had a spat with Gore a while back (I recall a fax referring to someone as \"Nellie Norman\"), we love this wittiest and most splendid of men to bits. Ah, but if only he hadn't been riven by self-doubt, who knows what he might not have made of himself. </p> <p>\u0095 Many will share the regret of Fatty \"Nicholas\" Soames, Kenneth Roy and others at the lack of deference in modern society. So well done Harrow council, for deciding to gift Harrow public school its own road! Harrow already owns part of Grove Hill, but the council wants to extend this right up to the school gates - and at no cost to the \u00a315,000 per annum school. Harrow claims this is essential for safety reasons, but locals, furious at the council's sycophancy, insist usual calming measures (humps, that sort of thing) would be fine. These people should know their place. Even if they can't bring themselves to line up on Grove Hill on the first day of term and do a bit of hat-doffing, the least the silly arses can do is hold their peasant tongues. </p> <p>\u0095 Thanks to all the readers who have suggested possible cast members for Carry On Up the Cabinet. Our email postbag is bulging, if digital messages can be said to bulge. I'm especially intrigued by the high number of nominations for Hattie Jacques to play the role of weirdo chancellor Gordon Brown. We are likely to stretch this subject out over the months to come, so keep the ideas coming. </p> <p>\u0095 A mayday call has been picked up from the world of high art. The performers behind the acclaimed interpretative show Puppetry of the Penis, running at the Whitehall Theatre in London, have run into a problem. Their insurers are insisting that they take on an understudy as soon as possible. \"Obviously they would need to have a talent for genital origami and an excellent stretch factor,\" says Katherine Camps, a spokesperson for the show. They'd also need an Australian or similar accent. The potential understudies will be called to a closed audition, and may be asked to perform some of the more complex installations, such as \"The Pelican\". Anyone interested should get in touch with the Diary. No photographs, please. </p> <p>\u0095 On the subject of Australian high art, today sees the opening of the magnificent new exhibition by Roger Law of Spitting Image fame at the Rebecca Hossack Gallery (35 Windmill Street, W1). The show's open until November 25, but queues are probably already forming around the block. (Can we please keep the Gerald Kaufman puppet now, Roger?) </p>",
  "While the US presidential debates were in full swing, I was pondering what I would ask the candidates if I had the opportunity to pose just one question. So here it is, Vice President Gore and Governor Bush: are you at all concerned about the mounting consumer debt spreading across every demographic sector of the United States population? <p>Gore and Bush seem to agree that the economy is humming, and have chosen to debate merely how best to allocate all of the surplus revenues. In the meantime, they both ignore a darker reality, one that could quickly change all of the up-beat economic forecasts coming out of Wall Street and Washington. </p> <p>Although economists and politicians don't want to talk about it, the fact is that the \"American miracle\" has, to a great extent, been bought on credit. It is impossible to understand the dramatic growth of the American economy and reduction in US unemployment in recent years without examining the close relationship that has developed between economic expansion, job creation and the amassing of record consumer debt. Consumer credit has been growing for nearly a decade. Credit card companies are extending credit at unprecedented levels. Millions of American consumers are buying \"on credit\", and because they are, millions of other Americans have gone back to work to make the goods and perform the services being purchased. As a result, the economy seems healthier than ever. </p> <p>Today, according to the Federal Reserve, Americans are spending more than they are taking in, marking the first time since the Great Depression that the country has experienced a negative savings rate. Just eight years ago the average savings rate in the US was 8% of after-tax income. Savings are now at their lowest level - 0.2 % - since monthly records began in 1959. </p> <p>Britain is fast following the American lead. In just the past year, the UK household savings rate plunged from 6.7% to 3%. If it continues to decline at this pace, the savings rate will likely be negative by this time next year, with potentially ominous consequences for the economy and society. </p> <p>An analogous situation occurred in the 1920s. Like today, that was a period of great economic change. Electricity replaced steam power across every major industry, greatly increasing the productive capacity of the country. Productivity gains, however, were not matched by a significant increase in worker compensation. Wages remained relatively flat, while many marginal workers lost their jobs in the wake of cheaper, more efficient technology substitutions. By the late 1920s, American industry was running at only 75% of capacity in most key sectors. The fruits of the new productivity gains were not being distributed broadly enough among workers to sustain increased consumption. Concerned over ineffective consumer demand, banks and retailers extended cheap credit in the form of instalment buying to encourage workers to spend more and keep the economy growing. By late 1929, consumer debt was so high it could no longer be sustained. Even the bull market was being stoked by record purchases of stocks on brokers' credit. Finally, the entire house of cards collapsed. </p> <p>The short-term substitution of consumer credit in lieu of a broad redistribution of new productivity gains is a subject that has received little, if any, attention among economists. Still, the fact remains that great technology revolutions generally spread quickly, once all of the critical elements are in place. The problem is that it generally takes at least a generation or more after a defining new technology finally comes on line, for social movements to build enough coherence and momentum to demand a fair share of the vast productivity gains that have been made possible. In the 1920s, the crisis of increased productive capacity and ineffective consumer purchasing power was met by the extension of consumer credit to unprecedented levels. </p> <p>The same phenomenon is occurring today. The productivity gains brought on by the information and telecommunication revolutions are finally being felt and, in the process, virtually every major industry is facing global underutilisation of capacity and insufficient consumer demand. Once again, in the US, consumer credit has become the palliative, a way to keep the economic engines throttled up, at least for a time. </p> <p>Consumer credit is growing by a staggering 9% annual rate and personal bankruptcies are increasing. In 1994, 780,000 Americans filed for bankruptcy. By 1999, the number of bankruptcies had soared to 1,281,000. </p> <p>If countries of the European Union were to lower their current family savings rate to zero, as the US has, they could probably accelerate economic growth and reduce unemployment to under 4%. Millions of people spending money \"on credit\" would assuredly grow the economy and bring millions of European workers back to work to make the goods and perform the services being purchased on credit. But following the US lead would only result in a short-term fix and create the conditions for an even more profound long-term period of economic instability when the extension of credit reached its limits, pushing consumers into default and the economy into a downward spiral, as occurred in the late 1920s and early 1930s. </p> <p>The issue at hand is: how long can Americans continue to spend more than they make, moving deeper and deeper into commercial debt? In the current situation, any number of external events could tip the scale, with potentially calamitous consequences. If the energy crisis were to deepen, raising fuel and energy costs, or the stock market were to experience a sudden and sustained down-turn, or major lending institutions were to pull back on their loans, the effect on all of our lives could be sobering indeed. </p> <p>The new economy won't be a reality until we have found a way to distribute the productivity gains of the e-commerce revolution broadly, to ensure enough consumer purchasing power to match the increases in productive capacity. In the past, that has always meant increases in wages and benefits and a reduction in work hours. If, instead, wages and benefits for middle and working-class Americans are allowed to remain relatively stagnant, as they have been for nearly a decade, and instead artificially prop up purchasing power by pushing millions of Ameri cans into record debt, we may squander the historic opportunity we now have to create a truly new economy that works for everyone. </p> <p>It is unlikely that either of the presidential candidates will focus on the troubling spectre of negative savings. Yet, whoever takes over the White House, it's a sure bet that sooner or later, the issue of ever-expanding consumer debt will force all of us to take notice. We may look back on the current \"prosperity\" with the same cynical regard as earlier generations who lived through the short-lived boom years of the Roaring 20s. </p> <p>Jeremy Rifkin is the author of The Age of Access: How the Shift From Ownership to Access is Transforming Capitalism </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "In a Pentecostal church in Dallas, Al Gore took time out from discussing the Middle East and taxation to declare: \"The centre of my life is faith and family.\" <p>While the Democratic candidate was stressing to the congregation the importance of family values this weekend, television viewers saw a new Republican campaign ad featuring the nephew of his rival. </p> <p>\"I am a young Latino and I'm very proud of my bloodline,\" the 24-year-old law student said. \"I have an uncle that is running for president. His name? The same as mine - George Bush.\" </p> <p>With just two weeks until the election, George W Bush and Al Gore are brushing up their image as devoted family men. In sharp contrast to Britain, where a brush with family values in the 1990s put most politicians off for good, familial love has been put at the heart of this year's campaign in America. </p> <p>The dynastic quality of the campaign came to the fore at the party conventions this summer. Members of the Bush and Gore clans gave primetime platform speeches about the candidate as a husband, son, dad, while senior members of both parties were kept on the sidelines. </p> <p>\"Welcome to the next president of America and a fine dad,\" gushed Karenna Gore Schiff, Al's telegenic eldest daughter and the head of Gorenet, an outreach programme for young Democrats. </p> <p>The use of family members is not new in presidential politics. It is simply that this year's campaign has given them all more prominent roles. </p> <p>Marshall Whittman, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, a non-partisan public policy thinktank, argues that this is both a reaction to the Clinton administration's scandals and the current state of the American psyche. \"America is economically prosperous but there is a fear that there is a values deficit,\" he said. \"Having a loving extended family is a way to inoculate yourself on values.\" </p> <p>The Gore campaign, in particular, has used the vice-president's family credentials both to humanise him and to distance him from Bill Clinton. It seemed to work in Los Angeles when Mr Gore's passionate kiss with his wife was credited with boosting his ratings. </p> <p>He regularly watches his only son play football on Saturdays, so much so that some of his aides fear that such time-consuming devotion could be costly as the campaign reaches its climax. </p> <p>It would have been hard for candidates from two well-known political dynasties to ignore their surnames. George and Al were named after presidential and senatorial fathers respectively. Several commentators argue that neither man would have been in the running had it not been for their family connection to politics. </p> <p>This adds a whiff of nepotism to the otherwise cheery picture of family life. To that end, Mr Bush Sr has played a relatively limited public role in his son's campaign. Pundits suggest that advisers got rid of him after he referred to a man standing for the US's highest elected office as \"the boy\" during the campaign's early days. </p> <p>Both candidates have been accused of the cynical packaging of family life. Tarek Milleron, who works as a driver and dogsbody for his uncle, the Green party candidate, Ralph Nader, is critical of Ms Schiff's platform performance in support of Mr Gore. \"She is obviously an intelligent person and there she is giving a speech she could have given when she was 14,\" he said. </p> <p>Others believe that this year's campaign is simply a feature of the Oprahfication of US politics, which started with America's best-known political family: the Kennedys.</p>",
  "<p>South Koreans should be celebrating the best of times right now. Decades of conflict with the north are starting to ease, their president has just won the Nobel peace prize and the economy has bounced back from the Asian financial crisis with double-digit growth. </p> <p>But on the streets of Seoul few people are in the mood to party. President Kim Dae-jung has slumped in the opinion polls, the stock market is plunging and the conversation of everyone from taxi-drivers to corporate executives is peppered with pessimism. The concern centres on Daewoo Motor, once one of the driving engines of the South Korean economy but now in the limbo of bankruptcy. </p> <p>Daewoo Motor has been on a financial life support system since last year, when its parent, the sprawling Daewoo conglomerate, collapsed with debts of $709bn. </p> <p>Parts of the group were packaged up and offered for sale. In a much heralded sign of South Korea's willingness to embrace globalisation, Ford was chosen as the preferred buyer for Daewoo Motor. </p> <p>But Ford suddenly pulled out of negotiations last month, amid rumours that it had found Daewoo's liabilities to be far worse than it had been led to believe. Creditors are now looking to General Motors, which is reportedly offering less than a third of the $7bn bid tabled by Ford. </p> <p>The government wants a deal by the end of the year, but analysts say the process of due diligence is likely to take months. Whether Daewoo can survive that long is far from certain. This week Daewoo will once again take a begging bowl to its creditors for funds to stay afloat. </p> <p>One or two banks would rather pull the plug on the firm, which is losing $90m per month. But, given the crisis that would follow such a move, the main creditor - the government-run Korea Development Bank - is expected to approve new funds, though only on a short-term basis. In recognition of this latest humiliation, Daewoo is expected to announce a new management reshuffle next week and begin work on a fresh restructuring package. According to the Korean media, 30% of the company's 20,000 jobs in South Korea will be cut. </p> <p>A sense of crisis pervades the company. Last month, workers at Daewoo Motor's design research facility in Worthing, Surrey, were alarmed to be told that they would have to wait for their salaries while the company negotiated new funds. The greatest fear, however, is that the company's market will dry up as consumers lose confidence in the brand. </p> <p>With the value of the company falling by the day, General Motors and its partner Fiat are believed to be in no hurry to close a deal. At least one creditor has already written off all debts it is owed by Daewoo Motor, suggesting the company could go for almost nothing. </p> <p>But whether it goes at all is open to question. GM is reportedly in favour of a part purchase of Daewoo's assets in South Korea, which would leave creditors with the bill for liquidating the company's least profitable operations. </p> <p>This break-up of the firm is fiercely opposed by Daewoo's main union, which has threatened to strike. It is demanding a large-scale injection of public money to put the company back on its feet. </p> <p>Such a pseudo-nationalisation is becoming increasingly likely given the political situation, say analysts. President Kim has completed more than half of his term in office and the ruling party do not want to create large-scale unemploy ment ahead of the next election. </p> <p>Anything but a sale to GM, however, would rattle foreign investors. With other negative signs for the Korean economy such as rising oil costs and falling prices of semiconductors, they have been deserting the stock market in droves. </p> <p>This outflow of capital comes at a worrying time. Many corporate bonds, taken out during the financial crisis two years ago, will come up for repayment in the next two months. With domestic banks still too weak to lend much, many analysts forecast a credit crunch by the end of the year that would come just as the economy starts to slow. After racking up 10.7% growth in 1999, Korea's output is forecast to expand by 8% this year and 6% in 2001. </p> <p>Few people expect a repetition of the near-meltdown that took place in 1997. The government's finances are far sounder, currency reserves are greater and important reforms have been carried out. </p> <p>But, without at least a sense of crisis, analysts say it may be difficult for the government to push ahead with the tough decisions needed for Daewoo and other sectors of the economy.</p>",
  "Vice-President Al Gore entered the final fortnight of the election campaign yesterday behind in the polls and fighting battles on three fronts - struggling to motivate apathetic Democrats and trying to win over swing voters while fending off a radical challenge from Ralph Nader, the Green candidate. <p>By contrast, the Texas governor, George W Bush, is able to focus almost solely on undecided voters in a handful of swing states, in the knowledge that the Republican core electorate tends to turn out in greater numbers than its Democratic counterpart. </p> <p>In the crucial last days of the closest presidential race in four decades, Mr Bush can also draw on a bigger campaign chequebook, principally because of the record amount of \"soft money\" (unregulated donations to the political parties) raised by the Republican national committee in the past few months. </p> <p>All the major opinion polls yesterday gave Mr Bush a lead over the vice-president, but the margins differed widely. While a Gallup/CNN/USA Today poll had the Republican contender nine points ahead, surveys in the Washington Post and the New York Times showed a smaller, statistically insignificant, lead of only 2%. Pollsters observed that the margin was eroding as Mr Gore's abrasive performance in the debates receded. </p> <p>The tactical choices facing each candidate were reflected in their campaigns yesterday. Appearing in Kansas City, Missouri, under the banner \"barnstorming for reform\", Mr Bush stuck to his \"anti-establishment outsider\" theme, declaring: \"When I go to Washington, I won't be looking for arguments, I'll be looking for answers.\" </p> <p>The line has been market-tested among undecided voters, who pollsters found had negative reactions to the word \"Washington\". Meanwhile the Democratic party issued a new political broadcast attacking Mr Bush's record as Texas governor, especially in education. The advertisement claimed that 40% of Texas high school students fail to graduate. </p> <p>Democratic aides acknowledge that it is unusual to be so focused on specific issues so late in the election. The Gore campaign is now trying to win back voters who agree with the vice-president on the issues but were alienated by his hectoring performance in the first and third debates. </p> <p>At the same time the Gore camp is facing the possibility that Mr Nader, the Green party candidate, could draw away enough Democratic votes to swing the election in as many as six swing states. Although Mr Nader still has less than the 5% support needed to win federal funding in the next election, he poses a threat to Mr Gore in states where the environment is a leading issue, such as Oregon and Washington, or where leftwing populism is still strong, such as Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan and Maine. </p> <p>In response to this threat, the Gore camp has launched a rearguard campaign, portraying a vote for Mr Nader as a vote for Mr Bush.</p>",
  "The world's last cold war confrontation moved a step closer to a thaw yesterday when the US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, met the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, in the highest level contact ever between the two states. <p>In talks lasting more than three hours, Ms Albright is believed to have discussed the possibility of a visit by President Bill Clinton, the North's missile programme and improved diplomatic relations. </p> <p>The visit, which was arranged in just 48 hours, is seen as a high-stakes gamble by Mr Clinton to leave a positive diplomatic legacy before he leaves the White House in January. </p> <p>Ms Albright arrived in Pyongyang to a low-key welcome that belied the importance of the visit to both sides. There was little pomp and ceremony and her motorcade drove through almost deserted streets - few people in the North can afford petrol, let alone cars. </p> <p>The reception was a sharp contrast to the flag-waving crowds that greeted the leaders of South Korea and Russia in the summer when they made their first visits to the North, which is slowly emerging from decades of isolation. </p> <p>But the handshake between Ms Albright and Mr Kim, which came just six years after the two sides almost went to war over the North's suspected nuclear weapons programme, was more significant. </p> <p>\"This is new from a historical point of view,\" said the North's leader. \"I feel absolutely delighted.\" </p> <p>\"I'm very glad to be here in your beautiful city,\" she responded. </p> <p>The two talked longer than expected and in the evening, Mr Kim - who has a knack of impressing his guests with unexpected warmth - suddenly announced a change in the schedule so that he could host a dinner for Ms Albright. </p> <p>US officials played down expectations of any new initiatives during the secretary of state's two-day trip, which is primarily designed to test the water for Mr Clinton. The US president has pushed for a rapid improvement in bilateral relations, despite concerns about Pyongyang's record on human rights. </p> <p>Two weeks ago, during a visit to Washington by Jo Myong Rok - Mr Kim's right-hand man - the two states pledged \"to take steps to improve their bilateral relations in the interests of enhancing peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region\". Ms Albright is in Pyongyang to assess the sincerity of Mr Kim's intentions, particularly over the North's missile programme, the main issue of concern for Washington and one reason why the US has pushed ahead with research into a \"son of star wars\" anti-missile system. </p> <p>If Mr Clinton visits the North, he will expect an assurance that Pyongyang will halt sales of ballistic missiles to states such as Syria and Iraq. Currently, this trade is one of the main sources of foreign currency for the impoverished communist country. </p> <p>In return for any such concession, Mr Kim would want the US to remove North Korea from its list of state sponsors of terrorism - the main obstacle to foreign trade and investment that Pyongyang desperately needs after a decade of drought, famine and economic decline. </p> <p>Last week, Britain, Germany, Spain and Belgium announced that they were ready to establish full diplomatic relations, but Mr Kim knows that he needs American support to gain access to the World Bank, and to receive development assistance from Japan. </p> <p>Analysts believe that the growing likelihood of a victory by George W Bush - who has been far more hawkish towards Pyongyang - in the US presidential election next month could push the North to give ground.</p>",

  "<p>Think of a system whose elite universities have endowment assets worth thousands of billions of pounds, but where the cost of being a student for four years can top \u00a3100,000. A country with no nationwide secondary school curriculum, and no A-level-style subject exams with grades to guide college admissions. Instead, imagine \"think about us\" mail-outs to targeted groups of up to 200,000 freshmen - who in turn can file up to 20 applications to different universities. </p> <p>This is America in 2000. But the key concerns are the same as in the UK - fair access, measuring standards, debt and funding. Time and again they came up as I crossed from coast to coast with other members of the Education Select Committee, talking to a range of state, private and community colleges. </p> <p>Just as in Britain, education has moved rapidly to the top of the US political agenda. Though it's not a federal responsibility, college education has been an issue in the presidential election for the first time in pundits' memory: Al Gore promised a $10,000 tax credit to help middle America pay its college tuition fees. </p> <p>Britain today is heading towards the mass higher education system the US has had since the end of the war - kick started by a GI bill which funded 2m American veterans through college. But with two-thirds of American high school graduates going on to some form of college, theirs is a system which sports everything, in football terms, from Super League to Vauxhall Conference status. </p> <p>For those out to win an Ivy League or equivalent place, competition is stiff. Less than 10% of those who applied for Stanford's graduating class of 2003 got in. Other top universities - public as well as private - have comparable ratios. </p> <p>Yet far from trying to damp down applications, American elite universities embark on annual campaigns to woo the brightest and best that would stagger their British counterparts. Roadshows of deans, professors, faculty staff, and past and present students take off countrywide - backed up by internet and email marketing. </p> <p>Anyone in the UK looking, in the wake of the Laura Spence case, for some superior objective and transparent holy grail will be disappointed. Even with the highest SATs and GPAs, far more hopefuls leap the hurdles than there are places at a Harvard, Stanford, Berkeley or Princeton. </p> <p>\"We are seen by students as having a difficult-to-predict admissions system,\" says Stanford's vice provost for student affairs, James Montoya. \"There is simply no way, given the competition, to have an entirely objective process.\" </p> <p>Though affirmative action - effectively admission quotas for minority groups - has been on the retreat after a number of state court and political decisions, the imperative to excellence can lead to some discreet tilting of the playing field. </p> <p>\"If you're saying would we admit a minority student who had cleared the threshold despite having arrived in the US as a refugee only four or five years ago above a middle-class white student with the same or marginally better SAT score, sure we would,\" was how one Berkeley insider put it. </p> <p>But British egalitarians might be less happy with the practice at Stanford, Princeton and Harvard of privileging \"legacy\" applicants - children of alumni - in the battle between equals for the last few places. Thirteen per cent of Princeton's undergraduate admissions are \"legacies\" - 40% of the children of alumni who apply get in. </p> <p>In-bred intelligence - or a US variant of the old school tie? And what about the blue-collar white boy from rural Alabama or Iowa who is not in the running for a minorities scholarship? Will he even be primed to apply in the first place? </p> <p>The funding packages - a mixture of soft loans, grants, scholarships and paid work on campus - vary. American students have salaried job opportunities - administration, library duties, tour guides, helping faculty staff - to a degree that would amaze (or alarm) their British counterparts. </p> <p>But not all packages cover the full cost. New York University is a private institution that was originally a New York-focused \"commuter school\". Today it has transformed itself into a campus-based university with country-wide admissions and high-cost residential accommodation in the heart of Manhattan for students and staff. And for NYU the lack of a Princeton-style endowment (despite a new and vigorous fundraising campaign) means there are gaps. </p> <p>\"NYU may be needs-blind in admissions, but we can't guarantee to satisfy every student's financial needs fully,\" I was told. </p> <p>Perception of costs does affect applications. Undergraduates at Rutgers - where an excellent state university education comes at a more modest $10-11,000 a year all in - said it had helped deter applications to Ivy League universities. </p> <p>Alumni contacts - and hopefully giving - are crucial here. \"We see it as joining a family for life,\" says Bill Stone, president of Stanford's alumni association, which has 11-12,000 alumni on its books as volunteers. </p> <p>Princeton raised $36.8m last year just from individual gifts for general purposes - one year's graduating class alone raised $2m. For Stanford being in the heart of Silicon Valley is a bonus. Jim Clarke's recent endowment of $150m for a biosciences centre leapfrogged Bill Gates's previous highest endowment. </p> <p>As for the students, like their British counterparts they tend to be apolitical, with weak student unions and no sabbatical officers. There was no evidence that the tight Gore-Bush race was firing up campuses, even at universities like Berkeley with a strong radical tradition. </p> <p>The class of 2000 tends to be career-focused and sometimes fiercely entrepreneurial - like the Stanford student who was aiming for a Nasa programme but meanwhile building his future in computer science via his own dot.com company. There is public service ethos - via a plethora of civic activities and internships, many of which can earn credits in America's broad-based four-year degree courses. At Rutgers this has been honed in the Case Service Learning programme, which has taken 12,000 undergraduates through expertise given to not-for-profit organisations in the local community since its launch in the mid-90s. </p> <p>\"We give our students some of the soft skills future employers want. We teach citizenship by doing, not preaching and at the end of the day they get a credit for it,\" explained Case director Professor Mike Shaffer. </p> <p>That \"can do, will do\" spirit has also fuelled the high-tech contributions of campus academics to national prosperity. This is not confined to Silicon Valley. In New Jersey, pump-priming by a state concerned to create new industries from a rust-belt past has spawned dozens of companies and patents via institutions at Princeton and Rutgers. These were set up by faculty staff and encompassed photonics, fibre optics and biotechnology. </p> <p>\"Every successful faculty member has to be some kind of entrepreneur - whether it's in business, intellectual property or hustling for federal or foundation funds. It doesn't make any difference if it's a public or private institution,\" James Sturm, head of Princeton's POEM Photonics Institute emphasised. That attitude, and the contribution of America's locally-based community colleges - which can feed bright students midway into four-year university degrees - helps explain why, despite rising costs and reductions in state and federal money, demand at all levels for a college degree is buoyant. </p> <p>The scale of endowments and fundraising in the US makes nonsense of suggestions that floating off Britain's so-called top universities would have an American effect. But there's much about the marketing of admissions, fostering alumni, entrepreneurship and citizenship that government and vice-chancellors could urgently learn from Uncle Sam - helped by more tweaking of the tax system by a sympathetic Gordon Brown. </p> <p> \u0095 Gordon Marsden is MP for Blackpool South and a member of the Commons Select Committee on Education. He is just back from a visit to the US as part of their enquiry into higher education.</p>"
