  "<p><strong> Mo Mowlam: The Biography</strong> <br> Julia Langdon<br> 299pp, Little, Brown<br> \u00a316.99 <br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502379837,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a> <br></p> <p> She is brave, ebullient, effective and immensely popular. A year after the general election of May 1997 that brought Tony Blair's New Labour government to power, her rating among the public stood at 86 per cent, exceeding that of any of her colleagues, the Prime Minister included. She seemed to be the politician elected governments long for. But now she has announced her intention to leave parliament, cabinet and government at the next election. Few shooting stars have climbed so rapidly and fallen so fast. Why? </p> <p>The easy answer is envy. A government whose leaders are intensely conscious of poll ratings, popularity and their own standing cannot tolerate, it is alleged, the presence among them of someone so loved. The explanation, however, is much more complex, and Julia Langdon explores it in a biography that is sympathetic and insightful, but lapses from time to time into repetitive hagiography. The litany of Mowlam's virtues - bright, funny, touchy-feely, direct, blunt, open - is repeated in quotation after quotation from former friends and lovers. The analysis of her colleagues' motives for sidelining and then dropping her is fascinating, but less fully explored. </p> <p>Mo had several counts against her. She came from a family under strain, held together by her determined mother, Tina; her charming and likeable father, Frank, drifted into alcoholism, and shamed his family with his capricious drunken rages. His second child, Mo, coped by escaping into homework. In these difficult circumstances, reminiscent of Bill Clinton's troubled boyhood, she learned how to please people - for she needed both appreciation and affection - and how to protect her own most private feelings. </p> <p>Her earliest ambitions were for academic achievement, and those ambitions took her through school (a good Coventry comprehensive) to the University of Durham, where she was an active and iconoclastic student leader in the turbulent late 1960s, and the University of Iowa, where she took her doctoral degree. It seemed that she was destined for academia. But she was not to be deflected from a political career, and she set about achieving it with determination, returning to to teach first at Newcastle University, and then at an adult education college in Barnsley. Those choices were directly related to her political aspirations. And here she encountered the first hurdle - being a woman. </p> <p>It was never easy for a woman to be selected for a winnable Labour seat; the macho culture of manufacturing industry went deep into Labour's soul. That culture was much stronger in the North than in the South. Mowlam found out during her years of local party involvement in Newcastle that women were expected to organise social events and make the tea. Much the same was true of South Yorkshire. During the miners' strike, she organised help for miners' families, but was not called upon to take a political role. She had, though, made a valuable contact in Charles Clarke, by then head of Neil Kinnock's office, and worked for him during the summer of 1983. </p> <p>Kinnock, who had no reservations about women in public life, admired her. \"Mo is one hell of a lass,\" he told his colleagues. His support encouraged her, but it was a stroke of luck that brought her a safe Labour constituency, Redcar, when its long-standing MP James Tinn decided to retire. </p> <p>In the House of Commons, Mo chose to become one of the lads: direct, blunt and at ease with what Julia Langdon delicately calls \"industrial language\". Her parliamentary pair, Michael Portillo, described her as \"a new sort of MP\". She didn't stay on the back benches long. Ten months after entering parliament, Mo was appointed junior spokeswoman on Northern Ireland. She was clearly being groomed for higher office, and after only 18 months she was moved to a key job in Gordon Brown's Treasury team as City and corporate affairs shadow minister. How well she did that job is a matter of controversy. What became clear was that she did not endear herself to Brown, nor he to her. </p> <p>And this was the second hurdle. For Mowlam was not only a woman, she was an unconventional one. The quotations in Langdon's biography are telling. One unnamed colleague said: \"She doesn't recognise the distance between other people's bodies and her own.\" It wasn't only that she trampled on the conventions - she took delight in doing so. One interview, 11 months after her election as member for Redcar, began with Mowlam declaring to the reporter, Colin Brown of the Independent , \"I've got a new bra on and it's killing me\". She insisted on telling ministerial colleagues that she asked her security police to buy tampons for her. And she made little secret of past lovers, though she made it clear she was no one's parliamentary bimbo. </p> <p>Not everyone was pleased. \"She stands too close when talking to you and uses your Christian name excessively,\" wrote Lynn Barber in the Mail on Sunday in February 1998. She ascribed it to the New Labour style. But that was wrong. It was Kinnock who liked such forthrightness, sometimes amounting to vulgarity; New Labour was altogether more uptight, seeking to establish its respectability in the eyes of the all important middle class. </p> <p>That was why it was surprising that Mo was appointed as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. She had, of course, already been the shadow spokeswoman in opposition, a job she made it clear at the time she did not want. She had established close contacts with many key people in the province - and with many ordinary citizens too. Furthermore, her directness, her warmth and her body language of hugs and embraces was in sharp contrast to the patrician distance adopted by many of her predecessors. She opened up Hillsbrough's gardens for parties, and broke down the barriers between the establishment and the republicans, to the horror of some officials in the Northern Ireland office, who briefed the media against her. </p> <p>Blair's gamble, however, worked. Without Mowlam's reaching out to the nationalist community it is doubtful whether the Good Friday agreement would ever have come about. The tragedy was that her value in bringing in the nationalists offended the unionists - and she was not at all the kind of woman the unionists warmed to. Indeed, few women have played even a minor part in the deliberations of the unionist parties. When the Women's Coalition managed to get two women elected to the Northern Ireland assembly - one Protestant, one Catholic - both were subjected to considerable abuse from fellow Assembly members. </p> <p>So she was at first indispensable, and then, some time towards the autumn of 1998, dispensable. It was clear that David Trimble was no longer prepared to work with her. Tony Blair became, in the words of Peter Mandelson, his own Northern Ireland Secretary. Mowlam was reduced to a secondary role. At a meeting with Blair and Bill Clinton, when the President asked her to sit down and join them, she responded with uncharacteristic bitterness: \"Oh, didn't you know? I'm the new tea lady round here.\" Mandelson, once a close enough friend to be a holiday companion, was now a savage critic. He characterised her as \"terminally undisciplined\": a very New Labour comment. </p> <p>No one can take away Mo Mowlam's achievement, or the impact that her warmth and her courage in the face of serious illness made on a public deeply suspicious of politicians. But she lost the good will of New Labour's quartet of leaders - or else never had it. First there was Gordon Brown, who would not have her on his team after that first shadow post; then there was Peter Mandelson; then Jack Straw, whom she had replaced in 1995 on the National Executive Committee, and who had been chosen by Blair ahead of Mowlam to manage his bid for the leadership. Blair himself was the last to abandon her, offering her the job of Secretary of State for Health in the reshuffle of June 1999. Mowlam, bent on becoming Foreign Secretary, refused. It was probably the greatest mistake of her political life. She believed Brown would have held back funds for the department if she were the minister, but the political imperatives made that unlikely. The post of Foreign Secretary was never a serious possibility. So she ended up with a portentous non-job, that of Cabinet enforcer. After Jack Cunningham's time there, it had begun to look like an ante-room to dismissal. </p> <p>Mowlam is a free spirit, and cannot easily be confined to a message or to a form of behaviour. That is one reason for her immense popularity - she has never distanced herself from ordinary people. Her style once irritated Arthur Scargill, tsar of the Yorkshire miners. Today it irritates Millbank. But it is a style that commends itself to the electors, and to her own party, a hybrid of new and old Labour. </p> <p>I met Mo earlier this year at a breakfast after the Frost programme. She indicated that I should sit beside her. With her usual frankness, she made it clear that life was pretty hellish and that she could not see what her job was about. She feared, however, that her resignation would damage the government's standing with its own supporters. It was one among the many lessons the government has learned painfully in these last few weeks.</p>",
  "Students walked out of classrooms, nurses and doctors came on to the streets and taxi drivers blocked the roads all over Serbia yesterday in preparation for a general strike. The marathon campaign of civil disobedience is due to start on Monday. <p>Opposition leaders have launched a two-pronged attack on the struggling president, Slobodan Milosevic. They are calling for a national protest campaign against him for refusing to accept defeat as president and are challenging his version of the election results in court. </p> <p>Mr Milosevic is refusing to cede power saying that his opponent did not win an outright victory. The opposition has accused him of election fraud. \"The whole story is over but nobody dares to say that to Mr Milosevic,\" said Zoran Sekulich, editor of the independent news agency Fonet in Belgrade. \"It's now or never.\" </p> <p>The opposition parties have called for an five days of protests but say more will follow in their attempt to unseat Mr Milosevic from power peacefully. \"We will continue with the rallies over the weekend and start a general strike on Monday to grind Serbia to a halt,\" said one of the opposition leaders, Zoran Djinjic. </p> <p>They want Mr Milosevic to cancel a run-off for the presidency ordered by the state-run election commission. </p> <p>Yesterday the opposition revealed details of what they say was election fraud in Kosovo, where Mr Milosevic claimed he had won 140,000 votes. K-For, the international force administering the province, says only 45,000 people voted and polling stations where these votes were said to have come from never opened. </p> <p>Although the general strike is not due to begin until Monday, crowds chanting \"He's finished\" and \"Slobodan save Serbia and kill yourself\" gathered in most of the major cities. </p> <p>The largest crowd was expected last night in Belgrade, where more than 200,000 turned out for an opposition concert and rally earlier in the week. The mood in the city is one of growing confidence and irreverence. Insulting postcards of the president as a gorilla with the face of his wife Mira superimposed on the naked body of a woman are circulating, as well as badges reading \"It's over\" and \"You're finished\". </p> <p>In Cacak, another strong opposition town, teachers and pupils from primary and secondary schools were on the streets. The mayor of Cacak, Velja Ilic, told them: \"You are the youth and brains of this country. You were the first to enter the strike in Serbia, you should be an example to others.\" </p> <p>Blocked from access to the state-controlled television in Belgrade, the opposition campaign is being run by word of mouth and through the former student radio station Index. </p> <p>Yesterday, journalists at one former state-run television station in Novi Sad also went on strike and said they would produce their own independent news. Last night the top story on state television was the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's volleyball win at the Sydney Olympics, but they also showed for the first time seven minutes of the opposition rally. They also reported accusations of election fraud by Mr Milosevic's party workers. For 13 years the state-controlled Radio Television Serbia has been one of Mr Milosevic's most important tools. </p> <p>The opposition have asked for direct meetings with army and police and there were unconfirmed reports yesterday that the army had agreed. </p> <p>They also want Russian help to prove that Vojislav Kostunica, the main opposition candidate, has won the election. According to the independent Belgrade newspaper Danas, copies of the election results had been sent to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, by diplomatic bag. The opposition insists that Mr Kostunica defeated Mr Milosevic by 51% to 36%. </p> <p>There have been few signs of police activity. At rallies and protests during the week, they spent their time chatting with demonstrators. Last night in Belgrade, as thousands flooded on to the streets of the capital, the only police around in the area were directing the traffic and offering helpful assessments of crowd numbers to journalists.</p>",
  "Richard Nixon was the last candidate not to take a presidential debate seriously. That was in 1960, the first ever televised contest, in which he faced a little-known senator from Massachusetts. No one has ever made the same mistake again. <p>John F Kennedy came to the debate looking tanned and healthy, having prepared for the event on the rooftop of his hotel. Vice-president Nixon had shrugged off advice to spend a few hours under a sun lamp and his naturally pallid complexion highlighted what seemed like a perpetual five o'clock shadow. </p> <p>As he arrived at the Chicago studio, Mr Nixon knocked an already infected knee against the car door. The pain drained the blood from his face and he began to sweat profusely but he waved away offers of make-up. When the debate went live across the nation, the visual contrast was startling. A vigorous and handsome challenger against a nervous and sweating office-holder. It arguably swung the closest US election of the 20th century. </p> <p>Forty years on, almost to the day, the nation is facing another presidential race which is too close to call. The campaigns are focusing on little more than 1m floating voters in a handful of swing states, where many people say they are waiting for this year's three debates between the vice-president, Al Gore, and governor George W Bush to make up their minds. </p> <p><b> Defining moment</b><br> </p> <p> There is, of course, nothing in the US constitution stipulating presidential debates, but it has become the defining moment of the campaign, when the two (or occasionally three) contenders face each other in direct combat. </p> <p>After his disaster in 1960, Mr Nixon refused to debate with anyone again, and the next televised head-to-head was not until 1976. Since then they have become unavoidable, as Mr Bush discovered when his attempt to renegotiate the debates, shifting the encounters to chat shows, made him look nervous and evasive. </p> <p>Ted Sorensen, a key Kennedy aide who later helped to coach Jimmy Carter and Mike Dukakis for their presidential debates, believes they have become an essential part of the democratic process. </p> <p>\"You can memorise arguments, but it is understanding issues which is necessary to avoid stumbles. And it can't be bad having the next president be forced to understand all the issues,\" Mr Sorensen said in an interview this week. </p> <p>The importance of debates is reflected in the enormous lengths the opposing camps go to in grooming their candidates for the event. Preparations start months in advance. This weekend, in the run-up to the first debate in Boston on Tuesday, both candidates will leave the campaign trail for dress rehearsals as meticulously prepared as anything on Broadway. </p> <p>Each nominee has publicly played down the extent of his preparations, but their studied insouciance is all part of the ritual manoeuvring. Governor Bush has been practising since May. </p> <p>This weekend he will hold a mock debate at his ranch in Crawford, Texas, where the family gym has been converted into a television studio, complete with lecterns, lights, cameras and a mock Al Gore, who will be played by a New Hampshire senator, Judd Gregg. It is a role he has perfected since performing as the slightly stiff and earnest vice-president in 1996, when he was advising the Republican nominee for the job, Jack Kemp. </p> <p>However, Mr Bush's preparations look slapdash compared to the lengths the vice-president is going to. Mr Gore is the supreme master of detail. He likes to ensure that the practice room is set at the precise temperature expected in the television studio, even allowing for the warming effect of the bodies of the audience. </p> <p>In his dress rehearsal, his opponent was to have been played by Tom Downey, a friend and former congressman who had been taking professional acting classes for the role. He had reportedly perfected Mr Bush's mannerisms and even his malapropisms. But this month Mr Downey received a package in the post containing a video of Mr Bush rehearsing for the debate together with a batch of briefing notes. An FBI investigation has been launched. Meanwhile, the Gore campaign, anxious not to be seen taking advantage of the leaks, disqualified a disappointed Mr Downey from the rehearsal. His place has been taken by Paul Begala, a former Clinton aide who shares Mr Bush's Texas accent and has just written a book about Bush's record as governor. </p> <p>Mr Gore has gone even further. When he retreats this weekend to his debate boot camp in a Florida marine laboratory, he will take with him not just the usual entourage of advisers, technicians and supporters, but also 13 specially selected \"regular folks\" from a cross-section of the population in swing states. They include a 76-year-old pensioner, a 14-year-old schoolgirl (chaperoned by her mother) an Hispanic construction worker and a black headmaster. <br> <b>Wit, wisdom and a five o' clock shadow</b><br></p> <p><b> 1960 Nixon vs Kennedy </b></p> <p>John Kennedy: \"We cannot turn the job over to anyone else. If the United States fails, then the whole cause of freedom fails, and I think it depends in great measure on what we do here in this country.\" Kennedy looked tanned and relaxed. Nixon was sick and sweating and his complexion made him look unshaved. Afterwards nobody could remember what was said. Only the way they looked. </p> <p><b> 1976 Ford vs Carter </b></p> <p>Gerald Ford: \"There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and never will be under a Ford administration.\" This was at the height of the cold war. </p> <p><b> 1976 VP debate: Mondale vs Dole </b></p> <p>Bob Dole: \"If we added up the killed and wounded in Democrat wars in this century it would be about 1.6m Americans. Enough to fill this city of Detroit.\" Dole's credibility suffered from the suggestion that the two world wars had been political. </p> <p><b> 1980 Reagan vs Carter </b></p> <p>Ronald Reagan: \"There you go again.\" This became Reagan's catchphrase and it blunted Carter's fact-laden attacks. </p> <p><b> 1984 Reagan vs Mondale </b> </p> <p>Ronald Reagan: \"I will not make age an issue in this campaign. I am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent's youth and inexperience.\" This line helped defuse questions about the president's advanced age, and strengthened his high likeability ratings. </p> <p><b> 1988 Bush vs Dukakis </b></p> <p>George Bush: \"Wouldn't it be nice to be the ice-man, and never make a mistake.\" This rescued the vice-president from his verbal blunders and deepened his image of Mike Dukakis as passionless. </p> <p><b> 1988 VP debate: Quayle vs Bentsen </b></p> <p>Lloyd Bentsen: \"Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.\" </p> <p><b> 1992 Bush vs Clinton</b> </p> <p>President Bush twice looked at his watch, making him look contemptuous of the proceedings and ill at ease. </p> <p><b> 1996 Clinton vs Dole </b></p> <p>Bill Clinton: \"I can tell you I don't think Senator Dole is too old to be president. It's the age of his ideas that I question.\" With this line, Clinton could appear gallant and issue-oriented and still portray his opponent as out-of-touch. </p> <p><b> 1996 VP debate: Gore vs Kemp </b></p> <p>Al Gore: \"I'd like to start by offering you a deal, Jack. If you won't use any football stories, I will not tell any of my warm and humorous stories about chloro-fluorocarbon abatement.\" The vice-president was able to make self-deprecating fun of his reputation for being wooden, while neutralising his opponent's strongest card - his past as an American football hero.</p>",
  "The most important power base of Slobodan Milosevic is now under serious threat after the far-right Radical party, which rules Serbia in coalition with the Milosevic regime, offered its support to the opposition. <p>It emerged yesterday that the Radical leader, Vojislav Seselj, contacted the opposition directly and offered his help. The move opens up a real possibility of overthrowing Mr Milosevic's hold on his legislative power base within the Serbian republic government by the end of this year. </p> <p>The Radicals are the most strident force in Yugoslav politics and their support for the Democratic Opposition of Serbia marks a major political shift. </p> <p>Mr Seselj is a former paramilitary, active during the war in Bosnia. He is famous in Belgrade for waving a gun on the streets on more than one occasion. Most recently, he threatened local journalists, saying they should be \"liquidated\". </p> <p>The Radicals are in the republican government of Serbia with the Socialist party of Slobodan Milosevic and the Yugoslav Left party of his wife, Mira Markovic. </p> <p>Mr Seselj, a highly intelligent man who came top of his class at law school in Belgrade, appears to be a populist, but he is also a political survivor. Many people label him, above all, a \"fascist\". </p> <p>The Radicals' support for Mr Kostunica's coalition is all the more surprising because the blocs were rivals in the election. But soon after the opposition and the Centre for Freedom and Democracy (Cesid) announced their results - both independently declaring Mr Kostunica the winner - the Radicals corroborated the claims with their results. </p> <p>The Radicals' own presidential candidate, Zoran Nikolic, performed miserably. </p> <p>Mr Seselj publicly recognised Mr Kostunica as president on Thursday. He congratulated him and sent a formal letter. </p> <p>Opposition sources say that Mr Seselj also offered the Kostunica camp political help because of the Radicals' power base in the Serbian republic's government. </p> <p>However, Mr Seselj is said to have pointed out that he is a pragmatic politician and explained that he would want something in return for his backing now. </p> <p>The Radicals have in recent days been going back dramatically on their past deeds. Mr Seselj, who signed the order for police to storm the Studio B television studio in May, has now called on Studio B to be brought back under the control of Belgrade city hall. </p> <p>He has called for a repeal of the information law which gagged journalists and newspapers - even though it was a law which he personally wrote. </p> <p>He is also calling for changes in the law governing the state newspaper, Politika. An attack on this by non-regime forces would deny Mr Milosevic a monopoly on information. </p> <p>Mr Seselj and his party have the power to provoke a crisis in the republic's government - but it may be that they decide to stay in government and to work against Mr Milosevic from within. </p> <p>\"It's easy to bring down a government, but we are not in a hurry,\" Mr Seselj said yesterday. </p> <p>Another key political party at republican level is the Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO) of Vuk Draskovic. His party suffered a terrible drubbing at the federal elections because of his failure to back the Kostunica coalition. </p> <p>He has admitted the error and has congratulated Mr Kostunica. The SPO is currently boycotting republic government sessions, but if it chooses to work with the Radicals, their joint representation in parliament could politically smash the regime at republic level. They could form a government together or, more likely, force republic elections. </p> <p>Mr Kostunica's coalition has made it clear that it wants republican elections by the end of the year. Mr Seselj has so far shown every indication that he will help the opposition to achieve this.</p>",
  "The president of Croatia, Stipe Mesic, yesterday sacked seven army generals for complaining that the government was insulting the memory of the country's war for independence by prosecuting alleged war criminals for atrocities committed against Serbs. <p>Mr Mesic's tough move was a sign of how far things have moved since the death of President Franjo Tudjman and the election of a liberal government which wants to restore links with the rest of Europe. </p> <p>As well as being a rare case of a country willing to try its former military elite - not just for corruption but for war crimes - Croatia's trials could be a precursor to similar action in Serbia, if the opposition leader, Vojislav Kostunica, succeeds in removing Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan Milosevic, from power. </p> <p>Although he has criticised the international criminal tribunal in the Hague for being an instrument of US interests, Mr Kostunica has left open the option of starting war crimes trials or a state-sponsored \"truth commission\" in Serbia. </p> <p>He says Serbia must confront its role in the last decade of Yugoslavia's civil wars. </p> <p>The seven Croatian generals who were sacked yesterday - Ante Gotovina, Kresimir Cosic, Damir Krsticevic, Ivan Kapular, Milenko Filipovic, Davor Domazet-Lose and Mirko Norac - were among 12 active and retired generals who made their allegations in an open letter published on Thursday. They were strong supporters of Tudjman's nationalist government. </p> <p>In the letter they noted \"with bitterness\" that the 1991 war against Yugoslavia has been presented \"as a crime and something filthy, while in fact it was the foundation of Croatia's freedom, independence and sovereignty\". </p> <p>They accused Mr Mesic and the government of \"waging a campaign to smear the independence struggle through recent spectacular arrests\". </p> <p>The generals were referring to the new government's decision to hold trials as well as to cooperate with the war-crimes tribunal in the Hague, even if the perpetrators were Croats. </p> <p>Investigators from the tribunal began looking for the graves of an estimated 120 Serbs in Gospic, central Croatia, earlier this year. </p> <p>In forcing them into retirement, Mr Mesic cited a constitutional ban against senior military officials publicly airing political views. \"My message to those who think they can bring down the government with pamphlets is that they are playing the wrong hand,\" he said, adding that the army must be \"depoliticised\". </p> <p>\"Whoever wants to be involved in politics has the right to do so; I won't suggest which party they should join. But while they are in the army they will not be publishing pamphlets,\" Mr Mesic said. </p> <p>The generals' protest follows the arrest earlier this month of four Croats suspected of killing Serb civilians in Gospic in 1991. Police also arrested several soldiers accused of slaughtering civilians in neighbouring Bosnia. </p> <p>Angry war veterans have been demonstrating against the arrests in Gospic on a daily basis for several weeks. </p> <p>In September, Milan Levar, a key witness, was killed by a bomb outside his home in Gospic. He had helped to defend the town in 1991 when local Serbs rebelled against Croatia's declaration of independence. But he was so shocked by his own side's actions that he decided to give evidence to the war-crimes tribunal in the Hague. </p> <p>Reporters in Gospic were threatened by the crowd during an arrest there two weeks ago. A radio reporter in Zagreb was also accosted by a man who put a pistol into his mouth, threatening to kill him. </p> <p>Ironically, despite Croatia's willingness to work with the Hague tribunal as well as to conduct its own trials, there is some resentment in Zagreb about the west's rush to lift sanctions on Yugoslavia and forget the war-crimes issue once Mr Milosevic leaves power. \"I don't think sanctions should be lifted until Yugoslavia does what we did: adopt a law on cooperation with the Hague tribunal and extradite its war-crimes suspects,\" Mr Mesic said this week.</p>",
  "Pierre Trudeau, who has died of prostate cancer aged 80, was Canada's most intellectual and flamboyant prime minister. His disdain for Quebec nationalism, belief in a bilingual, multicultural federation and commitment to the constitutional entrenchment of civic rights and freedoms were the hallmarks of his 17 years in government. <p>Elected to the Canadian parliament in 1965, he rose meteorically to the leadership of the Liberal party in 1968. He won three successive general elections, lost to the Conservatives in 1979, then led the Liberals back to power in 1980. In his final government, he secured a clear No vote in Quebec's first referendum on sovereignty-association, and entrenched Canada's constitution with a charter of rights and freedoms. </p> <p>Trudeau was born in Montreal in 1919 - a date confirmed only after he won the Liberal leadership, claiming to be a year younger than he was. His mother had Scottish and French-Canadian roots. His father was pur laine Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, an ambitious Montreal lawyer from a long line of unilingual peasant-farmers. Though his early death traumatised Pierre, his shrewd business deals secured the family a $1m fortune. </p> <p>By all accounts, Trudeau was a competitive young man, encouraged by his father to achieve athletic prowess and educated with disciplined intensity at Br\u00e9buf, the Jesuit college for Quebec's francophone elite. Physically and intellectually agile, he had a need to win or have the final word. </p> <p>After completing law school in 1943 - while campaigning against conscription - and articling for a year in Montreal, he took courses in political economy at Harvard, the Sorbonne and the London School of Economics, where he mastered ideas of constitutional liberalism, Parisian personalism and British Fabianism, before heading home via a year-long journey through the Middle East and Asia. </p> <p>Back in Quebec in 1949, Trudeau was shocked to find Quebec gripped by the regressive, Catholic nationalism that underscored Maurice Duplessis's corrupt Union Nationale govern- ment. Gerard Pelletier, a journalist he befriended in Paris, invited him to witness an asbestos workers' strike, an event that reinforced Trudeau's determination to oppose Duplessis and brought him and Pelletier into contact with the union leader, Jean Marchand, for the first time. </p> <p>Like many Quebec intellectuals who loathed Duplessis, Trudeau escaped to Ottawa and a junior job in the Privy Council Office preparing background material for constitutional conferences. He found the federal capital dull, and its bureaucracy patronising to French-Canadians, so returned to Quebec in 1951, worked as a civil liberties lawyer for the labour movement and edited a collection, The Asbestos Strike, challenging Duplessis. Consequently blocked from an academic law position at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, he co-founded Cit\u00e9 Libre, a journal that called for reason over nationalist passion. Federalism, by virtue of bringing diverse ethnic groups into a single state, he argued, would allow Frenchness to thrive in Canada. </p> <p>Duplessis died in 1959 and Quebec underwent a quiet revolution. The provincial Liberals won the 1960 election and created a welfare state to replace the Catholic church in healthcare and education. While most Quebec intellectuals welcomed this period, Trudeau used the university post he quickly acquired to attack the secular neo-nationalism of the Quebec state and the separatist movement it spawned. On November 5 1965, he stood with Marchand and Pelletier in the federal election, determined to address the French-Canadian question from Ottawa. </p> <p>Had the Quebec wing of the Liberal party been stronger, and Prime Minister Lester Pearson not been facing nationalist militancy in the province, the three men might have had fewer opportunities to influence the debate. As it was, in December 1965, Marchand persuaded Pearson to make Trudeau his parliamentary secretary, a job that gave him status within the Quebec caucus, access to the centres of government power and the international experience of travelling through the Francophonie to build support against Quebec separatism. In April 1967, Trudeau entered Pearson's cabinet as justice minister. </p> <p>It was the centennial summer, when President de Gaulle, touring Canada, called for \"Le Qu\u00e9bec Libre\". But the erudite bachelor Trudeau, who rode a Harley-Davidson and wore sandals in the legislature, worked through it, doggedly revising the criminal code. He modernised laws on divorce, homosexuality and abortion, arguing that \"the state has no place in the bedrooms of the nation\". </p> <p>Precisely what went on in Trudeau's own bedroom was always a subject of speculation. His extended bachelorhood and homosexual law reform encouraged rumours. But it was his liaisons with women that inverted his mantra of \"reason over passion\". There was nightclubbing at Commonwealth conferences, an affair with Barbra Streisand, and his secret marriage in 1971 to Margaret Sinclair, a beautiful, west coast flower child of a former cabinet minister. Some 30 years his junior, she bore him three children, helped win the 1974 election and then rebelled with doped-out indiscretions. </p> <p>Trudeaumania took root in February 1968, when he announced his candidacy for the Liberal leadership, soon after a televised showdown with Quebec's premier. He was the only French-Canadian running to head a party that alternates between francophone and anglophone leaders. His charisma and ability to reason clearly in both languages appealed at a time when Quebec tensions were, quite literally, exploding in mail-boxes around Montreal. Canadians adored this sexy genius, who wanted to create a \"just society\". </p> <p>On April 6 1968, after four ballots and seven-and-a-half hours of voting, Trudeau set out to rebuild Canada in his own image... \"this beautiful, rich and energetic country of ours can become a model in which every citizen will enjoy his fundamental rights, in which two great linguistic communities and people of many cultures will live in harmony and in which every individual will find fulfilment.\" Three weeks later, sworn in as Canada's 15th prime minister, he called a general election and, on June 25 1968, the day after nationalist demonstrators stoned him in Montreal, he secured the first federal Liberal majority since 1953. </p> <p>Trudeau set Canada on as independent a foreign policy course as possible in north America, opening diplomatic relations with China and reducing Canada's commitment to Nato. But his primary concerns were to counter Quebec nationalism, build national unity, overhaul government and ensure Canada's constitutional decolonisation. </p> <p>The 1969 Official Languages Act was his key response to state-centred nationalism in Quebec. It institutionalised bilingualism, created a federal bureaucracy that employs French-Canadians at every level, and delivers services in French and English. The strategy aimed to attract bright young francophones to work in Ottawa, not Quebec, and ensure that the provincial francophone majority, and the francophone minorities elsewhere, identified with the federal state. </p> <p> Like so many of Trudeau's ideas, it was brilliant in principle but problematic in practice. It granted individual rights and new employment opportunities to French-Canadians, reduced the domination of anglophone mandarins in Ottawa, but failed to counter Quebec nationalism's mystical appeal or anticipate the backlash. Although Trudeau tried to enhance national unity with a department of regional and economic expansion, he never undercut the resentment that citizens west of Winnipeg felt about his obsession with Quebec. Trudeau restructured the cabinet committee system, expanded the prime minister's office, and engaged the Liberal party in a massive, exercise of policy innovation, establishing task forces on everything. Though designed to build policy on liberal principles and encourage participation in his \"just society\", these measures frustrated the party faithful, who were used to brokerage politics, and irritated the electorate when policymaking took too damn long. </p> <p>Trudeau's rationality was fundamentally challenged on October 5 1970, when the terrorist Front de Lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec (FLQ) kidnapped James Cross, the British trade commisioner in Montreal. Five days later, the FLQ abducted (and later murdered) the Quebec labour minister, Pierre Laporte. Urged on by Quebec's liberal premier, Robert Bourassa, Trudeau took the drastic step of invoking the War Measures Act in peacetime. </p> <p>His popularity soared, but the promoter of civil liberties had put the military on the streets, suspended habeas corpus and legitimised massive arrests of FLQ suspects. Civil libertarians and Quebec nationalists never forgave him. </p> <p>When Trudeau called a general election in 1972 - with the slogan \"The Land is Strong\" - his campaign strategy proved weak. The love-in was over, and unemployment had soared. In his drive to bilingualise Canada, calm insurrection in Quebec, and overhaul Ottawa, he had forgotten to oil the party machine, failed to curb inflation and dismissed the bilingual backlash as bigotry. The Liberals scraped back to power with 109 seats, against the Tories' 107, and Trudeau formed a minority government with support from the New Democratic party (NDP). </p> <p>Trudeau, the pragmatist, now surrounded himself with professional party men. His speeches became emotional, his contacts with the party faithful more personal, and policy implementation was faster as deals were forged with the NDP. Pensions and family allowances increased, and the Foreign Investment Review Agency was created to boost economic sovereignty. After two years, he went back to the electorate with Margaret at his side, and the Liberals secured a majority third term. </p> <p>Although Trudeau and his cabinet reverted to protracted planning exercises, creating a new tax structure to redistribute resources from richer to poorer provinces, he ensured Canada's entry to the G7 group and initiated trade contracts with the EEC, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific rim. Petro-Canada was created to placate westerners and, in 1978, the Canadian Human Rights Commission was established to root out discrimination. But inflation and unemployment spiralled as the Liberals found themselves unable to cope with the impact of the 1973 oil crisis. </p> <p>In October 1976, they reversed their election promise, established the Anti-Inflation Board and imposed wage and price controls. To cap it all, in November 1976, Trudeau's old rival, Ren\u00e9 L\u00e8vesque, led the nationalist Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (PQ) to victory in the provincial election, determined to seek a new sovereign-association between Quebec and Canada. PQ's victory re-energised Trudeau's fight against nationalism, but by now Margaret was against him. She spent their sixth wedding anniversary at a Rolling Stones concert, and told People magazine that her nipple outlines excited state visitors. Two months later, the couple separated. </p> <p>In May 1979, the Liberals' inability to boost the Canadian economy brought Joe Clark's Conservatives to minority government. Trudeau was shattered and, in November, he announced his retirement. </p> <p>But it was not the end. Three weeks later, the Conservative government was defeated. Trudeau stayed on, and, in February 1980, won another majority government. In that final term, there was the second oil crisis, an intensification of energy battles with western Canada and new tensions in the US-Canadian relationship after Ronald Reagan won the presidency. But the May 1980 Quebec referendum produced a clear 60-40 victory for the federalists, and a historic battle between Levesque and Trudeau. </p> <p>For Levesque it was horrendous. If the Conservatives had stayed in power, his social-democratic government would have had an easier time promoting sovereignty-association. But Trudeau's icy logic exposed sovereignty association as a weak compromise that would ensure Quebec's eventual secession. Days before the plebiscite, he promised Quebeckers that if they voted No he would renew the constitution. </p> <p>He did just that. On May 21 1980, he set about getting the constitution patriated from Britain. Over lunch at Downing Street, he informed Mrs Thatcher that the Canadian constitution was coming home - although neither she, nor her advisers, had enough understanding of Canadian constitutional politics to anticipate what followed. </p> <p>In October 1980, having failed yet again to get the provincial premiers to agree on a constitutional amendment formula, Trudeau announced that he was taking unilateral action on a \"people's package\" to patriate the constitution and entrench it with a charter of rights. He was challenged by three provinces in the Canadian supreme court, who all used provincial diplomats in London to lobby British backbenchers. </p> <p>In September 1981, the supreme court decided that although Trudeau's initiative was constitutionally legitimate, it betrayed conventions which held that the majority of premiers should agree to constitutional amendments. On November 5 1981, 16 years to the day that Trudeau was first elected to parliament, the federal government and nine provinces came to a patriation deal that Quebec would not sign. </p> <p>Aboriginal leaders were livid, claiming that their contract with the Crown had been negated. But the process for patriating Canada's constitution, complete with a charter of rights and a clause allowing governments to opt out of certain sections for five years at a time, went ahead in Westminster. On April 17 1982, in pouring rain, the Queen and Trudeau signed the proclamation of a new Canadian constitution and the Quebec government was bound by a charter it loathed. </p> <p>In many senses, Trudeau had won his battle against Quebec nationalism. He had overseen the creation of a charter that will have a lasting impact on Canadian jurisprudence, but he had not managed to create the pan-Canadian nation-building instrument that would fully clarify the relationship between all Canadians and the federal state. </p> <p> Two years later, he left office and found a perch in a Montreal law firm. He raised his sons, produced a self-justifying memoire, canoed his heart out and fathered a daughter by the constitutional lawyer, Deborah Coyne. He read lots, wrote less and travelled more. </p> <p>He re-emerged in full force in 1987 and 1991 to speak out against new constitutional proposals to recognise Quebec as a distinct society, a stance that won him some respect in western Canada, but rekindled nationalist loathing in Quebec. Indeed, in October 1995, when Prime Minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien staged a desperate, mass-Canadian rally in Montreal to save Canada from its closest call ever in the second Quebec referendum, Trudeau, the man who had championed federalism all his life, was asked to stay away. </p> <p>He kept custody of his three sons Justin, Sacha, and Michel after his separation and later divorce. Michel died in a skiing accident in 1998. His other two sons and daughter survive him. </p> <p> <b> Annis May Timpson</b> </p> <p> Joseph Phillippe Pierre Yves Elliot Trudeau, politician, born October 18 1919; died September 28 2000</p>"
