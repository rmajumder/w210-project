  "The Ivory Coast's opposition leader, Laurent Gbagbo, today swept to power after a people's revolt ousted military ruler General Robert Guei. <p>Tens of thousands of people took the streets to protest after Gen Guei proclaimed himself the winner of Sunday's presidential election following his dissolution of the national electoral commission which organised the vote.</p> <p>Several potential candidates, including former prime minister Alassane Ouattara, were barred from standing in the poll by the supreme court. Today Mr Ouattara's supporters marched through the Ivory Coast's capital, Abidjan, calling for a new election.</p> <p>Gen Guei has fled Abidjan for Cotonou in nearby Benin, his former information minister, Henri Cesar Sama, said. Mr Sama was among the soldiers who turned against the dictator. </p> <p>Mr Sama said that pro-Gbagbo soldiers were trying to convince the remaining junta forces to put down their arms. He said another senior junta member, Captain Saint Cyr Djikalou, had also defected. </p> <p>The general came to power in a December coup, the first military takeover in Ivory Coast. Instability since has battered the economy and frightened the people. Gen Guei had promised that the elections would mark a return to civilian rule. </p> <p>Violent clashes erupted yesterday after Mr Gbagbo called on his supporters to take to the streets. Opposition leaders claimed nine people were killed.</p> <p>Before dawn today, mutinous soldiers were defeated by loyalist comrades in an Abidjan military base. Hours later, thousands of Mr Gbagbo's supporters swarmed through the streets of Abidjan, erecting barricades, lighting fires and screaming for Gen Guei's resignation. </p> <p>Soldiers loyal to Gen Guei fired shots in the air as they attempted to disperse unarmed demonstrators gathering outside the dictator's residence, in an exclusive suburb of the capital. </p> <p>But by midday, more members of the security forces had joined the ranks of the protesters. Demonstrators had overrun broadcast facilities for state radio and television, and thousands more were outside the broadcast offices in central Abidjan. At least two people were killed and four were injured in the clashes, witnesses said. </p> <p>Mr Gbagbo was introduced as \"president; in an address broadcast on state television and said he would be forming a cabinet shortly. He praised his supporters for opposing what he called Gen Guei's \"electoral coup d'etat\". </p> <p>\"I pay particular homage to those who died in the cause of this,\" he said. \"We will give them a funeral befitting their courage,\" he said. The speech was recorded at his campaign headquarters, where it was played on loudspeakers to hundreds of cheering supporters standing outside. </p> <p>The announcement triggered celebrations on the streets of Abidjan and of the western city of Gagnoa, a Gbagbo stronghold. Some protesters beat on drums while others sang and danced in the streets.</p> <p><br><b>Useful Links</b><br><a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/200010250035.html\">Analysis - allAfrica.com</a> <br><a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/200010250032.html\">Related story - allAfrica.com</a><br><a href=\"http://web.amnesty.org/ai.nsf/Index/AFR310032000?OpenDocument&amp;of=COUNTRIESCOTE+D'IVOIRE\">Background - Amnesty International</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.georgetown.edu/kokora/political/gbagbo10.htm\">Speech: Gbagbo - Georgetown University</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,387599,00.html\"> Previous events: 'rigged' vote - Guardian</a><br><a href=\"  http://news6.thdo.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/africa/newsid%5F930000/930254.stm\"> Profile: Robert Guei - BBC</a></p>",

  "It is a measure of Al Gore's increasing desperation that he is spending his time this week not in the big \"swing\" states which deliver dozens of votes in the electoral college, but rather in small states hitherto regarded as unswervingly for the Democrat cause. <p>One such is West Virginia, which has voted for Republican candidates only twice since 1960. Gore will hold a huge rally in the state on Friday. At least he hopes it will be huge - several of the papers are pointing out that there are plenty of free tickets still going spare. </p> <p>West Virginia has twice as many registered Democrats as Republicans. But that may not count for much, in a viscerally conservative part of the US, where the papers display little enthusiasm, let alone passion, for the contest. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.com/\" target=\"_new\">Charleston Daily Mail</a> - an afternoon paper with a masthead identical to our own dear Mail - is teasingly still on the fence, though it has published endorsements for Republican and Democrat candidates in the slew of elections for state legislators and judges. </p> <p>The Mail's sister morning title, the <a href=\"http://www.wvgazette.com/\" target=\"_new\">Charleston Gazette</a>, is clearly sympathetic to Gore. Last week it printed a leader indignantly attacking the Republican gibe that the vice-president is given to telling fibs. The paper rebutted each of the detailed accusations in turn, then sadly observed: \"But these facts probably won't dampen the sneer-and-smear campaign against Gore. After a ridicule movement is launched, it takes on a life of its own, even if it's untrue. That's sad.\" </p> <p>In Clarksburg, the splendidly named <a href=\"http://www.cpubco.com/\" target=\"_new\">Exponent-Telegram</a> is braced for tomorrow's visit by Tipper Gore, the Democrat candidate's indefatigable wife. The paper offers not a whiff of partisan interest in the election, but its interesting page of local opinion surveys indicates a strongly conservative readership which rejects stricter gun controls, is strongly anti-abortion, and would happily abolish affirmative action programmes to aid ethnic minorities. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.dominionpost.com/\" target=\"_new\">Dominion Post</a> of Morgantown is primly declining to endorse candidates. But it has started an exhaustive 14-day presentation of candidates' views in the state and national elections. It laments: \"Voter turnout here and across the country has dwindled, often leaving a minority of citizens making decisions that affect all citizens. Voter participation is key to making our democracy work. We hope you read the daily profiles and the candidates' stands on issues. We hope they prove helpful to you in learning more about them and where they stand. But most of all, we hope you vote.\" </p> <p>The Dominion Post is fairly clearly of a conservative bent. Last week it advised its readers not to trust the tax and spending promises of either presidential candidate: \" Voters should remember two important factors before they rush to judgment in supporting either candidate's economic promises. First, their promises are based on projections -- estimates that are based on continued economic growth and prosperity and peace around the world. In short, they're betting the bank on more than doubling the length of the longest economic expansion in history, predicting a recession-proof economy for an entire decade.\" </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.newstribune.townnews.com/\" target=\"_new\">Daily News-Tribune</a> of Keyser is determinedly keeping its eyes lowered from the race for the White House, though it does devote some space to the plea by incumbent Lois Kesner to be reelected as magistrate for Mineral County. </p> <p>The Bluefield (pop 12,361) <a href=\"http://www.bdtonline.com/\" target=\"_new\"> Daily Telegraph</a> at least offers agency reports on the national election, but nothing by way of opinion. The <a href=\"http://www.register-herald.com/\" target=\"_new\">Register-Herald</a> of Beckley lengthily reports a barnstorming visit to the town by four Republican state governers, stumping up support for West Virginia incumbent Cecil Underwood.</p>",

  "Boston is a city rushing towards its future. The \"Big Dig\" is hollowing out the belly of the city to allow traffic to pass beneath its growing business district. But the cold damp earth is also discharging ghosts of Boston's past, who have arisen to haunt it. <p>So far this year, the police have dug up the bodies of six victims of a particularly murderous Irish-American mob called the Winter Hill Gang. The latest body was found within the past few days and investigators believe there are many more.</p> <p>The gang is supposed to have eliminated of 18 of its enemies and disposed of the remains somewhere under the bustling city.</p> <p>Most of the bodies have been there since the 1970s, when the poor neighbourhoods of South Boston and Roxbury were ruled by the gangs and wrenched apart by racial tensions. But their significance cannot simply be consigned to the city archives.</p> <p>The gang leader charged with the killings, James \"Whitey\" Bulger is still at large, with a price on his head of $250,000 (\u00a3171,800) and the number three position on the FBI's ten most wanted list (behind Osama bin Laden and Eric Rudolph, a fundamentalist anti-abortion activist responsible for a string of bombings).</p> <p>The fact the FBI has not been able to find Whitey Bulger since he disappeared five years ago is all the more embarrassing because it turns out he was one of their own - an informant who was allowed, quite literally, to get away with murder in return for information about rival, mostly Italian, gangs.</p> <p>It is quite likely Bulger was protected for another reason. His brother William is the former president of the Massachusetts state senate and is now the president of the University of Massachusetts.</p> <p>The Winter Hill affair has seriously wounded the FBI in Boston and across the country. One of its senior agents, John Connolly, faced charges earlier this month of leaking information to Bulger and his lieutenant, Stephen \"The Rifleman\" Flemmi, which led the mobsters to two other FBI informants and a potential witness against them. All three were murdered.</p> <p>\"The Boston black eye is a very serious black eye,\" said Charles Rogovan, an expert on the FBI and organised crime from the Temple University in Philadelphia. \"This cuts to the very heart of what the bureau does.\"</p> <p>At his trial, Connolly has pleaded not guilty and refused to cooperate with investigators, and there is still no sign of the 71-year-old Bulger, rumoured to be in Ireland. All the FBI can do is call for the doubling of the reward money, and take steps to make sure such a disaster does not reoccur.</p> <p>Since the Bulger case broke, the FBI has been working on a new ethics code, which will, among other things, require every new agent to take a 15-week ethical training course, including a visit to the Holocaust museum in Washington. </p> <p>The visit is meant, according to the FBI's Boston chief Charles Prouty \"to show them what happens when there is an absence of the rule of law.\" New agents will also be given a handbook listing the FBI's values including \"uncompromising institutional and personal integrity\".</p> <p>It sounds like a tall order, but the transformation currently underway across the city may yet intervene to soften the ethical and professional dilemmas complicating the FBI's struggle with organised crime. </p> <p>The old neighbourhoods and their tight-knit ethnic clans are being loosened and broken apart by gentrification. The gangs are either dissolving or moving into white collar crime. The days of Whitey Bulger have passed, even if he remains maddeningly out of Boston's grasp.</p> <p><b>Email</b><br> <a href=\"mailto:julian.borger@theguardian.com\">julian.borger@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Related special reports</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/US_election_race/0,2759,376727,00.html\">US election race</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/usguns/0,2759,182056,00.html\">Gun violence in America</a></p> <p><b>Other articles:</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=%28julian+borger%29AND+%28VdkPublicationDate+%3E%3D+01%2DSep%2D1998%29&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=score+Desc&amp;Query=julian+borger&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv=\">More articles by Julian Borger</a></p> <p><b>Useful links </b><br> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/\" target=\"_new\">The Washington Post</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.boston.com/globe/\">Boston Globe</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.arlingtoncemetery.org/\" target=\"_new\">Arlington National cemetery</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/wamo/\" target=\"_new\">Washington monument</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.defenselink.mil/pubs/pentagon/\" target=\"_new\">The Pentagon</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/\" target=\"_new\">The White House</a><a> <br></a><a href=\"http://www.capsteps.com/\" target=\"_new\">Capitol Steps political satire</a><a> <br></a><a href=\"http://AmericanPresident.com/xword.html\" target=\"_new\">Washington crossword</a> <br><a href=\"http://dc.about.com/citiestowns/midlanticus/dc/\" target=\"_new\">Washington DC homepage</a></p>",
  "The US president, Bill Clinton, has raised the possibility of inviting the Israeli and Palestinian leaders separately to Washington for talks. <p>Mr Clinton made a talks offer in a 30 minute phone call to the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, in which he urged him to implement three commitments made at the Sharm el-Sheikh summit in Egypt earlier this month, including steps to end the violence. </p> <p>The commitments were to take concrete steps to reduce bloodshed, to work on a fact-finding inquiry into the failure of the peace process and to look for a way back to the negotiation table.</p> <p>A White House spokesman said any attempt to break the cycle of bloodshed in the Middle East would be dependent on how the two sides lived up to commitments made earlier this month at a summit in Egypt. \"At this point,\" the spokesman insisted, the possibility of inviting the two leaders separately to Washington is \"only a possibility.\" </p> <p>But he stressed that implementation of the first two agreements were not preconditions to hosting separate meetings with Mr Arafat and Mr Barak in Washington. </p> <p>The president has been in contact with Mr Barak in recent days, according to his spokesman, but has not yet broached the idea of a meeting in Washington directly with him. </p> <p>An Israeli embassy spokesman, Mark Regev, said he has \"no information whatsover about Clinton's suggestion of a possible meeting\".</p> <p>In four weeks of fighting between Israelis and Palestinians, 127 people have died. The only brief break in the violence followed the meeting between Mr Arafat and the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, at Sharm el-Sheik on October 17.</p>",
  "While surveys of public opinion about the presidential campaign may throw up widely conflicting messages from the voters, the hard-nosed futures market is pointing forcefully towards a victory for George W Bush. <p>The University of Iowa has run a \"winner-takes-all\" futures market for the presidential election since 1988, and its predictions have been right every time. Speculators assess the two candidates as though they were commodities and invest in one of them. </p> <p>Last week the value of the Gore contract was 51.6 cents, but at the beginning of this week it had slipped to 37.5 cents. Mr Bush, who had been trailing in the preceding weeks, was seen by Monday as suitable investment: the value of his contract jumped on Monday from 48 cents to 62 cents. </p> <p>This effectively means that speculators believed that he had a better than 62% chance of victory in the November 7 election and have been putting their money behind it. </p> <p>The system is seen as giving a better picture of the chances of the two candidates, since people stand to lose money if they are wrong. Those giving opinions to pollsters are notoriously fickle, and uncertain whether they will turn up to vote. </p> <p>This week's valuations show a big shift from the golden days of the Gore campaign: after the Democrats' convention in Los Angeles in August, his speech and the smacking kiss he gave his wife made him worth 71 cents. </p> <p>But as his campaign has stumbled, and with his failure to deliver a knock-out blow in any of the three presidential debates, his valuation has tumbled. </p> <p>Speculators can also bet on the popular vote, and here they still agree that the final outcome will be very close. Mr Bush is valued here at 49.7 to Mr Gore's 48.6 cents. </p> <p>The futures market apart, gamblers who fancy a flutter on the result have a problem: it is illegal in the US to bet on the outcome of a presidential race. </p> <p>Anthony Curtis of the Huntington Press, a Nevada-based gambling newsletter, said: \"I've heard of it being offered illegally but most bookies don't want to fool around with that sort of thing.\" </p> <p>In traditional surveys the Green party candidate, Ralph Nader, who is causing concern to Mr Gore in key western states, is polling between 3% and 5%.</p>",
  "I have spent most of the last week watching Al Gore do his best to lose an election. And make no mistake, this was Gore's to lose. He started out as the incumbent at a time of American dominance abroad and record-breaking prosperity at home - running against a graduate from the Dan Quayle school of political gravitas. It should have been a walk in the park. But Gore has succeeded in making it a slog in the mire. <p>Of course, in a race this close everything could change between now and November 7. But the evidence so far is not encouraging. It's not just the bald poll numbers, which have George W Bush narrowly ahead. It's the state-by-state polls, crucial in a system where winning the right combination of states matters more than the total number of votes nationwide. Here's where Gore is in trouble. Places he should be able to call his own - Minnesota, Oregon, his native Tennessee - are suddenly in play, with Bush inching out front. </p> <p>But more important than any poll is the feel and atmosphere, the smell of the campaign - and that's what's turning against Gore. He's beginning to look like a loser. If that impression solidifies, he's done for: Americans like to back a winner and, if Bush is deemed the man, Gore's support will haemorrhage away. </p> <p>How has this happened? How has a candidate who should have coasted to the White House come to see it slip into the distance? The answer says lots about Al Gore, a fair bit about America - and much about the way our own politics could soon be heading. </p> <p>Here's a Gore soundbite I heard repeated perhaps a dozen times: \"This election is not about the past, it's about the future.\" Put that down as Gore mistake number one: he is not running on the record of the last eight years, he's running from it. Sure, he mentions the phenomenal prosperity Americans enjoy now, which they did not in 1992, but only in order to discuss how he might build on it. </p> <p>That may be honourable, but it is dumb politics. For it takes the current budget surplus as a given, an inevitable fact of nature which both Presidents Gore or Bush would enjoy. In an instant, the playing field is level - and Americans are not asked who deserves credit for this success, but to choose between rival plans on how to spend it. Gore's entire advantage is eroded. </p> <p>The flesh-and-blood embodiment of Gore's refusal to run on the recent record is, of course, Bill Clinton. The vice president never refers to the Clinton-Gore administration, even though it still enjoys sky-high approval ratings; nor does he refer to his boss by name; nor does he want to be seen with him in public. Score that as Gore mistake number two. </p> <p>The strategists say Clinton is still a turn-off to the crucial undecided voters in swing states, America's Worcestor Women, who regard the Prez as a sleaze. But by bowing to that tiny sliver of voters, Gore has robbed himself of the nuclear weapon of American politics: the best campaigner in the world. He could have had Clinton working below radar, energising the core Democratic vote, firing up black communities (where Clinton is still adored), doing radio ads, motivating workers in blue-collar states like Michigan. Instead, Gore has kept the big dog chained up, pining to be set free. </p> <p>How could Gore do this to himself? The answer probably has less to do with electoral calculation than egotism and petulance. The vice president is sick of being in the big guy's shadow; he desperately wants to win this one on his own, as \"my own man\". There is a horrible precedent here. In 1996, Israeli Labour party aides begged Shimon Peres to use TV ads centred on his much-loved (and slain) predecessor Yitzhak Rabin. But Peres was too proud. Like Gore, he wanted to win the election on his own. Instead, he lost it all by himself. </p> <p>Which brings us to the central problem of the Gore candidacy: his personality. The simple fact, repeated ad nauseam, is that the vice president does not connect. I'd read it before, but now I've seen it. I watched him address a trade union rally in downtown Manhattan, a hotel ballroom packed with activists and loyal Democrats. They were rooting for Al, desperate for him to do well. They lifted their heads and waved their banners, straining to make a connection with the candidate. And he spoke fluently and well. But the moment of connection - that near-telepathic moment of emotional docking that happens every time Bill Clinton steps into a room - just refused to happen. Gore's words seemed to skim over the audience, not one of them sinking in. At the rally's end the room drained instantly, a sure-sign of an ailing candidacy: when it's a good one, the punters can't tear themselves away. </p> <p>Part of the trouble is linguistic. Gore uses complex, Latinate vocabulary while his opponent prefers plain, Anglo-Saxon English. Asked about the Middle East, Gore urged the Palestinians to \"cease and desist\"; Bush said, \"Put down your rocks, put down your stones.\" Which message would you remember? </p> <p>This is why the three TV debates were all bad news for Gore. Technically he may have won, by being smarter than Bush, but that was not the problem. By sighing audibly in the first debate and marching over to Bush and, in Americanese, \"invading his personal space\" in the third, Gore came off as arrogant and obnoxious, a combination of school swot and playground bully. Bush, meanwhile, sounded sufficiently plausible on the issues to scrape across the threshold required of a presidential candidate - and was a whole lot more charming. One poll afterward found Bush beating Gore on the likeability index by 60 points to 31. </p> <p>Why does this matter? Because this is where this elections is being fought. Compulsory campaign stops these days are not the factory gates or county fair, but Regis Live and the Rosie O'Donnell Show: the Richard and Judy hour of American TV. Presidential candidates have to go on these shows, alongside Hollywood wannabes and breast cancer survivors, and be warm, open and friendly. Gore struggles. Bush is a natural. </p> <p>\"This is not a popularity contest,\" says the Gore team. But that's mistake number three. For that's exactly what this election has become. We are in the era of Big Brother democracy, with politics a national soap opera. Election day is like that Friday night moment on Channel 4, with the viewers deciding who to cast in America's lead role. Voters are not so much choosing the leader of the free world, as deciding which guy they want to see on their TV sets day in, day out for the next four years: Gore's voice droning on, or W - a guy who knows how to party? </p> <p>Clinton's to blame, of course. He turned the Oval Office into the Big Brother house, a voyeurs' den of sex and psychodrama. He survived each week, but the deputy enjoys none of his luck. Unless he changes pretty fast, Al is about to be kicked off the show. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com\">jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "During the American election campaign of 1992, President Bush delivered a scathing verdict on Messrs Clinton and Gore: \"My dog Millie knows more about foreign affairs than these two bozos.\" Now the United States may be about to elect an even bigger bozo - George W Bush. <p>\"Dubya\" could certainly use some expert advice from Millie. Last November, a TV interviewer asked him to name the leaders of a few countries that were in the news. \"The new Pakistani general,\" Bush replied, having already failed with India and Chechnya, \"he's just been elected - not elected, this guy took over ...\" \"And can you name him?\" \"General, I can name the general.\" \"And it's ...?\" \"General.\" </p> <p>Liberal Washingtonian sophisticates were vastly amused. The online magazine Slate began compiling an archive of Bushisms (\"updated daily\") which now runs to 11 long pages. Some of these are essentially malapropisms - \"hostile\" for \"hostage\", \"anecdote\" for \"antidote\", \"cufflink\" for \"handcuff\", \"preservation\" for \"perseverance\", or (my favourite) \"terrier\" for \"tariff barrier\". Others are expressions of plain ignorance, such as his admission that he thought Slovakia was the same place as Slovenia. </p> <p>A few, rather like Dan Quayle's best lines, have their own surreal splendour: \"I know the human being and the fish can coexist peacefully\"; \"families is where wings take dream\"; \"I am a person who recognises the fallacy of humans\"; \"it is clear our nation is reliant upon big foreign oil: more and more of our imports come from overseas\"; \"you can't take the high horse and then claim the low road\"; \"will the highways on the internet become more few?\" </p> <p>At the start of this year, the American punditocracy seemed to assume that Bush's dunderheadedness would guarantee his eventual defeat. Yet he has now overtaken the studiously cerebral Al Gore, the self-proclaimed creator of the internet, who can probably identify the capital of Slovenia or the president of Pakistan in his sleep. Why? </p> <p>One reason is that many voters apparently don't want a president who makes them feel stupid. Bush himself is clearly aware of this, and now cracks self-mocking jokes about his linguistic incompetence at every opportunity. He was also quick to deny a suggestion in this month's Vanity Fair magazine that he has severe dyslexia, even though it might have won him some sympathy and disarmed his tormentors. (Musn't mock the afflicted, must we?) The implication of his rebuttal seemed to be: I ain't ill or disabled, I'm just a good old American dimwit - an amiable chump, a genial goof, a second Ronnie Reagan. </p> <p>But there is another message, albeit largely subliminal (or \"subliminable\", as Bush would say): You can trust me, cos I'm not smart enough to be devious and dishonest. Even when he is caught telling a whopper - as in last week's presidential debate, when he boasted of pushing through a patients' bill of rights which he had in fact vetoed - people seem willing to blame it on his feeble, faulty memory rather than wilful deceit. </p> <p>Al Gore, by contrast, is not only a smart-alec whose head bulges with hard-disk capacity but also a liar. Last month he told the Teamsters union that when he was a baby his mum lulled him to sleep by singing Look for the Union Label - a song which was written when Gore was 27 years old and had presumably outgrown his cradle. The story is about as plausible as Tony Blair's recollection of watching Jackie Milburn play football for Newcastle. </p> <p>As with Blair, however, Gore's inventiveness isn't limited to harmless and endearing childhood anecdotes. Blair has repeatedly claimed, falsely, that he voted for Mike Foster's anti-hunting bill; Gore says that he was \"the author\" of the earned income tax credit, even though it was passed by Congress in 1975, two years before he entered the house. According to Andrew Rawnsley's book, Tony Blair lied about Bernie Ecclestone's \u00a31m gift to the Labour party; Al Gore's mendacity about his own fund-raising activities is eerily similar. </p> <p>Three years ago, Gore flatly denied that he had ever attended meetings at the White House to discuss illegal \"hard-money\" donations. When documents later surfaced showing that the vice-president had indeed been present, he told the FBI that he \"drank a lot of iced tea during meetings, which could have necessitated a rest-room break\". (This ingenious alibi was promptly exploded by Harold Ickes, the former deputy chief of staff, who testified that he had always stopped the meetings when the vice-president left the room.) Under interrogation by the justice department in April this year, Gore was asked about more than 30 fund-raising \"coffee mornings\" which he had hosted at the White House before the last presidential campaign. He said he had \"no concrete recollection\" of any such events. Perhaps all those cups of coffee had kept him almost permanently in the lavatory. </p> <p>Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, various wiseacres have asserted that we are now at the End of History: that American-style democracy is the unimprovable culmination of human achievement, a universal model which all countries will henceforth copy. A glance at this year's contest between Dumbo and Pinocchio might make even Francis Fukuyama wonder if he spoke too soon. </p> <p>The one serious and substantial candidate, Ralph Nader, has been excluded from the televised debates and largely ignored by the mainstream media, perhaps for fear that he'll show up his rivals as a couple of bozos. Potential Nader supporters are being warned by liberal Democrats that unless they vote for Gore as \"the lesser of two evils\" they will be responsible for letting Bush into the Oval Office. This is a counsel of despair and desperation - \"like a man on a raft facing the decision of whether to drink seawater or his own urine\", in the words of Alexander Cockburn. </p> <p>Yet the American media is still gamely and patriotically pretending that the election confirms the sublime superiority of their version of democracy, and that the electorate should thank Gore and Bush for forcing it to decide between piss and the deep blue sea. A Washington Post editorial this week argued that although many aspects of the campaign were \"squalid\" and \"corrupt\", and although neither candidate had any obvious principles or \"inner conviction\", nevertheless both Gore and Bush were decent, admirable fellows: \"The nation this year is fortunate in its choice.\" The latest issue of Time magazine piles on the flattery: \"The Lover vs The Fighter ... With just two weeks to go, the campaigns have made the choice clear: Do you want Bush's pledges of civility or Gore's crusading punch?\" </p> <p>The lover versus the fighter! Oh brave new world, that has such titans in it. The real \"choice\", alas, is rather less alluring: will it be the flubber or the fibber? </p> <p><b>Playing to the crowd</b></p> <p>I have been rebuked by the Rev Douglas Alexander, who conducted Donald Dewar's obsequies, for the \"tastelessness and insensitivity\" of my comments last week. </p> <p>For the benefit of the Rev and anyone else who missed the point, let me try again: the object of my mockery was not Donald Dewar, whom I liked, but the eccentric Blairite notion that the theme of the bloodthirsty book of Isaiah is \"social inclusion\". (I'm reminded of the prime minister's claim a few years ago that New Labour owed its philosophy to \"the ancient prophets of the Old Testament\".) </p> <p>Meanwhile, if Douglas Alexander wishes to pursue his campaign against tasteless and insensitive behaviour, he should have a word with his friend Tony Blair - who strode into Dewar's funeral, as he had done at Cardinal Hume's, grinning and waving to the crowd like a Spice Girl at a royal film premiere.</p>",
  "South Africa yesterday attempted to end the row over President Thabo Mbeki's controversial views on the causes of Aids by launching a nationwide health campaign which implicitly repudiates the presidential opinion. <p>The minister of health, Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, told reporters in Soweto yesterday that the new guidelines for healthcare workers were intended to help implement the government's five-year plan released earlier this year. </p> <p>She insisted the government operated on the premise that HIV caused Aids - earlier this year Mr Mbeki attracted withering international criticism for associating with dissident theorists who doubt whether HIV is the sole cause of the disease. </p> <p>The ANC government's new campaign, launched in full-page newspaper advertisements, emphasises the benefits of safe sex and the use of condoms and faithfulness between partners. </p> <p>But criticisms remained last night that despite the new campaign, the Mbeki government was still failing to issue anti-retroviral drugs to an estimated 4.2m citizens already carrying the virus. </p> <p>The charge has been exploited by the opposition Democratic Alliance. With a eye to local government elections on December 5 - the first test of the Mbeki presidency since the general election - they have promised to distribute the medicines free of charge in municipalities which fall under their control. </p> <p>The opposition leader, Tony Leon, is expected in Europe this week for negotiations with the pharmaceutical companies on the supply of anti-retroviral drugs at reduced prices. </p> <p>The ANC hit back angrily by claiming that the opposition offer mounted to an attempt to use black people as guinea pigs in drug experiments. </p> <p>Evoking parallels with experiments with poisons carried out on blacks during apartheid, the ANC's chief spokesman, Smuts Ngonyama, said: \"We find it quite outrageous that this issue, which is at the core of survival of humanity, can be exploited for political grandstanding. </p> <p>\"[South Africans] are being used as guinea pigs and conned into using dangerous and toxic drugs that are detrimental to their own health.\" </p> <p>There are indications that support for Mr Mbeki is declining as a result of his stand. Recent polls indicate that his personal popularity has fallen from 71% in May to 52.2%. </p> <p>In spite of the ministry of health claim that the government accepts the causal link between HIV and Aids, political insiders close to the presidency report that Mr Mbeki, if anything, is becoming more emphatic in his contrary stand. </p> <p>Earlier this month a leaked account of an ANC parliamentary caucus meeting had him not only reasserting his denial of a causal link between HIV and Aids but claiming that the truth was being covered up by a conspiracy among the drugs companies, backed by the CIA. </p> <p>He claimed that the international conspiracy to undermine him and South Africa had been mounted because the country was seen as an emerging leader of the developing nations in its challenge to the world economic order. </p> <p>He also said there was a campaign to brand him as being deranged and the government was investigating those responsible.</p>",

  "<p>The governor of the Bank of England, Sir Eddie George, acknowledged yesterday that the pound was \"substantially overvalued\" against the single currency, as sterling's surge on the foreign exchanges was blamed for the loss of 1,300 jobs at Panasonic's Cardiff plant. </p> <p>In the latest blow to the struggling manufacturing sector, the company cited the government's indecision over the European single currency and the pound's strength against the euro, and weakness against the dollar and yen, as factors prompting its decision to cut half its workforce. </p> <p>But Sir Eddie warned that the pound could be brought down against the euro only by cutting interest rates, which would destabilise the economy. </p> <p>Making a robust defence of UK policy towards the euro since its launch at the beginning of last year, Sir Eddie said that to have joined when the single currency was introduced would have risked \"something of an inflationary boom\". </p> <p>Britain would have been faced with both a weaker exchange rate and lower interest rates during a period when the economy was growing strongly, he said. </p> <p>Panasonic's decision is the latest by a foreign investor, including other Japanese groups, to scale down its Welsh operations, with around 2,000 jobs lost in television-making in the past few months. </p> <p>Last week Sony cut 400 jobs at its Pencoed plant near Bridgend, partly blaming the pound's strength against the euro, while Hitachi and other groups have also reduced their workforces in response to sterling and technological change. </p> <p>The Welsh economy is heavily dependent on manufacturing, which accounts for 30% of GDP compared with the UK's 17%, and after years of attracting foreign manufacturers bodies such as the Welsh development agency have only just begun switching their emphasis to promoting services. </p> <p>Panasonic said it would cut 700 permanent jobs from among its 1,800-strong full-time staff, with 600 part-timers who work on a seasonal basis to go as planned. The redundancies are due to take effect by Christmas. </p> <p>Adair Turner, vice-chairman of the pro-EMU lobby group Britain in Europe, said: \"This decision is yet another example of the damage that sterling's volatility outside the euro is bound to do to British manufacturing.\" </p> <p>Sir Eddie, speaking at a conference in Paris alongside Jean-Claude Trichet, the governor of the Bank of France, said the weakness of the euro complicated the task of the Bank's monetary policy committee in setting UK interest rates. </p> <p>The economy was growing faster than it had historically, unemployment was the lowest for 20 years and on one commonly used measure inflation was the lowest in Europe. </p> <p>\"Our problem in the UK is the imbalance within the overall economy between those sectors that are competing with producers in the euro zone, who are under considerable pressure, and the rest of the economy, which is doing relatively well. </p> <p>\"Believe me, we are very conscious of the desirability of exchange rate stability with our partners in the single market,\" he said, though he added that signing up for the single currency would provide only limited exchange rate certainty. </p> <p>\"The ... weakening of the euro since the beginning of last year has not made things easier for us. Just as the euro is undervalued in terms of medium-term 'fundamentals', so in the same terms sterling is on most calculations substantially overvalued against the euro.\" </p> <p>Despite the pound's strength, the UK recorded its first trade surplus with the rest of the EU in August for almost five years, according to official figures published yesterday. Exports exceeded imports by \u00a331m. However, economists said firms were slashing prices in pounds to retain customers.</p>",
  "President Vojislav Kostunica inched forward yesterday in his effort to take more power from his defeated opponent Slobodan Milosevic when the Serbian parliament appointed a transitional government to run the republic until elections are held in December. <p>Nearly three weeks after he was declared the winner of Yugoslavia's presidential election, Mr Kostunica's allies won the right to oversee the Serbian premiership and the key ministries of police, information, justice, and finance. </p> <p>As Yugoslav president, Mr Kostunica's main power is in appointing the foreign and defence ministers and the army chief of staff. </p> <p>He has kept on the defence minister appointed by Mr Milosevic, even though he is an indicted war criminal, on the grounds that it takes time to consolidate democracy. </p> <p>The other key powers are with the Serbian government, which was controlled by Mr Milosevic's Socialist party. A Socialist, Milomir Minic, will be the new prime minister of Serbia, but he will have to act in agreement with his two deputies, one an ally of Mr Kostunica and the other a representative of the opposition Serbian Renewal Movement. Three-party troikas will be in charge of the main ministries. </p> <p>This unusual division of power will at least allow Mr Kostunica's allies to escape some of the blame for what looks like being a tough winter for most Serbs, with looming shortages of fuel. </p> <p>But he will get credit for the huge programme of food and energy aid from the European Union and the United States which his election victory has unleashed. </p> <p>Mr Kostunica is hoping that the alliance of 18 parties which won him the presidential election will get the majority of seats in the Serbian parliament in the polling booths on December 23. </p> <p>\"The time of this government is limited and so are its tasks,\" Mr Minic told parliament. \"Its two main missions are to stabilise economic policy and urgently address the economic needs of the citizens.\" </p> <p>The new president is planning to visit Moscow on Friday to thank his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, for the important role he played in the transfer of power. </p> <p>The Russians were the last major state to recognise Mr Kostunica's victory. Although this was derided by many western officials as a sign that Moscow was out of touch, the timing of the Russian declaration was significant. </p> <p>It came a few hours before Igor Ivanov, the Russian foreign minister, arrived in Belgrade to see Mr Milosevic and the new president the day after crowds stormed the parliament building and the main state-owned television station. The announcement that Mr Putin accepted Mr Kostunica's victory was a bitter blow to Mr Milosevic. </p> <p>Mr Milosevic was still wondering about using the army to reverse the result and restore his rule, but at their meeting Mr Ivanov warned him not to try. </p> <p>In some ways the Russians' action paralleled their contribution during Nato's air strikes, when their special envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin, joined forces with western governments in urging Mr Milosevic to accept defeat in the military duel. This too was highly significant. </p> <p>Mr Ivanov also persuaded Mr Kostunica to visit the defeated president at his villa and mollify him with assurances that he would not be extradited to the Hague. </p> <p>According to Yugoslav intelligence sources, Mr Kostunica promised Mr Milosevic that he would resist western pressures for extradition, however strong they became. </p> <p>He also promised to maintain stability in the army, which was interpreted to mean that he would not replace the defence minister and army chief of staff. </p> <p>Some Yugoslavs wonder whether Mr Kostunica needed to take such a conciliatory approach. But the fact that Mr Milosevic still retained considerable power through the Serbian government apparently convinced the new president that he had to move slowly and gradually. </p> <p>The fact that he took nearly three weeks to get agreement on a new Serbian government, which is still a hybrid of pro- and anti-Milosevic forces, may also justify his caution.</p>",
  "Al Gore's \"Nader problem\" spread like a rash across the map of the United States yesterday, as his chances of winning eight states came under threat from the radical Green party challenger. <p>The vice-president, diverting resources to head off the threat from the left, mounted a head-on offensive against Ralph Nader, the Greens' leader, spending a large amount of time in small western states such as Oregon and Washington to defend his green credentials. \"I will stack my environmental record against anyone, including him,\" Mr Gore told reporters on board Air Force Two. </p> <p>The vice-president's aides and supporters in Congress, meanwhile, are pressing home their point that a vote for Mr Nader is equivalent to a vote for the Republican presidential candidate, George W Bush. </p> <p>Late last night the Gallup/CNN/USA Today daily tracking poll showed the vice-president inching ahead of Mr Bush by one point. While statistically insignificant, it was a psychologically important shift. </p> <p>However, Mr Gore has so far failed to eliminate Mr Nader and his radical populist message as a threat. In the closest presidential race in four decades, the 66-year-old veteran consumer activist holds the balance of power in eight swing states, which together account for 70 of the 270 votes in the electoral college, the body through which the states elect the president. </p> <p>With his firebrand anti-capitalist rhetoric, Mr Nader regularly draws bigger crowds than Mr Gore or Mr Bush. </p> <p>He has described Mr Bush as \"a giant corporation running for president, disguised as a person\". But he has often had even harsher words for Mr Gore, calling him \"fork-tongued\", \"Pinocchio-nosed\", and a \"certified political coward\". </p> <p>The Nader threat is most potent in north-western states such as Washington and Oregon, where environmental issues and liberal politics flourish. But Mr Nader has also fed off a backlash against globalisation in urban centres in Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota, where old industries have shrunk in recent years. </p> <p>In the depressed town of Flint, Michigan, for example, where General Motors has shed 23,000 jobs in the past five years, Mr Gore recently drew a crowd of 200 people for a rally, while Mr Clinton attracted a turn out of 500. Mr Nader drew more than 1,100 enthusiastic supporters. </p> <p>In several policy areas where the Republicans and Democrats share a lot of common ground, Mr Nader offers a markedly different approach. He calls for a moratorium on the death penalty, he would cut military spending by a third, decriminalise marijuana, establish public financing for political campaigns and set up a system of universal healthcare. </p> <p>A dozen former members of \"Nader's Raiders\" from the candidate's days as a pro-consumer gadfly in the 1960s and 1970s, called on him last week to reconsider his campaign. </p> <p>\"It is now clear that you might well give the White House to Bush,\" they said. \"As a result, you would set back significantly the social progress to which you have devoted your entire, astonishing, career.\" </p> <p>Mr Nader shrugged off his old comrades' entreaties, however, telling a crowd of supporters: \"The most important power they have over us is the power to make us think they are the only choices.\" </p> <p>Part of Mr Gore's problem is that there is no counterweight to Mr Nader on the right to take votes away from Mr Bush. Ross Perot helped elect Bill Clinton in 1992 by drawing votes away from George Bush's father, but the party split this year, and its far-right candidate, Pat Buchanan, can barely raise 1% in the opinion polls. </p> <p>The Green party's ambition is to win 5% of the vote, and thus win government funding in 2004. However, its signifi cance has been magnified by the closeness of the race, which could be the tightest since John F Kennedy beat Richard Nixon by a fraction of a percentage point in 1960. </p> <p>Mr Nader's emergence as a serious player owes much to America's fondness for mavericks. He follows very few rules from the traditional politicians' playbook, often walking without a glance as groups of supporters clamour for autographs. At times he appears grouchy, rarely smiles, and speaks in a choppy, staccato style which lacks the usual cadences of populist politics. </p>"
