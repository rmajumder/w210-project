  "<p><strong> Terminator two</strong><br> </p> <p> Eco Soundings' old friends Novartis and Astra Zeneca are due to announce a merger soon to become the world's largest agribusiness. Today British shareholders are being invited to nod through the merger that would form a GM company to dwarf Monsanto. Points for shareholders to note: the combined company would hold 42% of all the \"terminator\" and \"traitor\" technology patents - the widely discredited technologies that allows plants to grow with sterile seeds or plants which must be \"switched on\" by chemicals. On which point, could someone ask Astra Zeneca just why they are growing some GM potatoes at their Jealott's Hill research station in Berkshire which need chemicals to be activated. To Eco Soundings' knowledge, this is against UN guidelines because no assessment has yet been done into their social or ecological effects. </p> <p><strong> Voice of Nader</strong><br> </p> <p> Ralph Nader, the Green Party choice for US president, had much to fume about last week. First he was excluded from the much-hyped televised debate between front runners Al \"Ozone Man\" Gore and George W \"Big Oil\" Bush. Then after wangling a spectator's ticket to the event last Tuesday night, he was brusquely turned away at the door. Still, Ralph's supporters got the last word, as several hundred chanting \"corporate whores\" made themselves heard outside the debating chamber as the invited audience emptied out. What's more, their man's fortunes appear to be rising. With three weeks to election day, latest polls show Nader's support up from 3% to 7%, a margin big enough to affect the outcome in key battleground states. </p> <p><strong> Sour taste</strong><br> </p> <p> At the recent Asia Pacific Economic summit of the World Economic Forum in Melbourne, GM campaigners were strongly attacked for undermining developments that could supposedly save millions of lives. Michael Garrett, executive vice-president of Nestl\u00e9, warned that people in poor countries were dying while \"well-fed\" activists debated the finer points of GM foods. This show of corporate concern astonished Patti Rundall OBE of the Baby Milk Action campaign who has spent a lifetime singling out Nestl\u00e9 for \"violations\" of the international code for the marketing of breast-milk and who has to keep reminding the giant corporation that bottle feeding with substitute milk kills millions of children in poor countries. </p>",
  "<p>For 20 years global efforts to curb climate change have concentrated on finding ways to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from industry and transport. But could that approach be fundamentally wrong? </p> <p>Yes, says Dr James Hansen, one of America's leading climate scientists and the man credited with persuading Vice-President Al Gore of the seriousness of global warming. </p> <p>In a controversial new report, Hansen and colleagues at Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, urge the world's governments radically to re-think climate change strategy. They claim that the emphasis on carbon dioxide (CO2) may have been misplaced, with atmospheric levels of the gas apparently stabilising in the late 1990s. And they argue that global efforts should be redirected to using existing technologies to cut other climate-warming pollutants such as methane and traffic-generated ozone and black carbon (soot). </p> <p>The report, published in the Proceedings of the US National Academy of Sciences, says that reducing the release of methane from landfills and rice paddies and of black soot from diesel-powered vehicles will combat warming more quickly than concentrating on CO2. To this end, it urges western nations to help the developing world to adopt proven clean technologies such as catalytic converters and waste-to-energy plants which capture methane. </p> <p>In the early 1980s, Hansen was one of the first scientists to link rising temperatures with rising levels of carbon dioxide - and to warn of dire consequences if mankind failed to cut consumption of the coal, oil and gas which fuel modern economies. But he now claims that climate change should be significantly cheaper and easier to combat than previously thought. </p> <p>\"We're suggesting a more optimistic scenario than the conventional wisdom which says that curtailing global warming is almost hopeless,\" Hansen told the Guardian. \"I believe the prospects for having a modest rather than a disastrous climate impact are quite good.\" </p> <p>Hansen and his colleagues accept the scientific consensus that carbon dioxide is responsible for roughly half of all man-made global warming over the last half century. But their report cites evidence that man-made CO2 emissions have slowed considerably in the last 20 years and even fell slightly in 1998 and 1999, while the global economy - and fossil fuel consumption - has boomed. It also says that fossil fuel industries should no longer be the primary targets for remedial action, as the chemical aerosols released by the same plants form a cooling blanket in the atmosphere, offsetting the warming effects of their carbon emissions. </p> <p>Hansen added that there would be \"huge\" public health benefits from making a more concerted, worldwide effort to tackle air pollution which blights crops and exacerbates respiratory diseases in millions of people worldwide. \"I am not suggesting that we forget about carbon dioxide, I am suggesting that we place a strong emphasis on tropospheric ozone and black carbon - substances which not only have a warming effect but also a huge impact on human health. These substances are not even included in the current Kyoto negotiations.\" </p> <p>His report, however, has dismayed environmentalists and many climate scientists. They fear that by confusing the science of climate change it may undermine political will to implement the 1997 Kyoto treaty. Already, the powerful US fossil fuel lobby has used Hansen's findings to question the credibility of the treaty, which binds nations to cut emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to below 1990 levels by 2008-2012. </p> <p>Dr George Woodwell, a climate expert and director of the Woods Hole Research Centre in Massachusetts, denounced Hansen's proposals as \"dangerous\" and \"crazy\". The recent drop in carbon dioxide levels, he said, was probably caused by an as yet unidentified \"sink\", such as vegetation, which was soaking up the gas but could be saturated at any time, causing atmospheric levels to soar again. </p> <p>\"Arguing that we should forget about CO2 for the time being while we reduce other greenhouse gases assumes that we have time to allow carbon dioxide levels to just keep on rising,\" he said. \"That would be a very dangerous assumption on which to base the future of six billion people.\" </p> <p>Roger Higman, climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth in London, claimed Hansen's proposals were aimed at making action to slow climate change more palatable to America's car-loving policymakers and public. \"It's a tactical suggestion to try to rescue the Kyoto treaty and get it ratified by the US Congress. But concentrating first on other greenhouse gases will only delay the judgment day when America will have to get to grips with its petroleum economy.\"</p>",
  "At a rather rightwing lunch last Friday, I expressed my pleasure at the popular uprising in Serbia which had toppled Slobodan Milosevic. \"Popular?\" a Tory gent harrumphed, in the way that only old Tory gents can. \"I think there's something deeply suspicious about it. Look at those cars and buses driving into Belgrade, led by a bulldozer to deal with police roadblocks. It wouldn't surprise me in the least to learn that the drivers had all been paid by the CIA.\" <p>Those who uphold the existing order can never accept that ordinary citizens might be able or willing to challenge it, and so any manifestation of \"people power\" is always followed by a search for the hidden hand that has been pulling the strings. I was, therefore, unsurprised by my lunch companion's conspiracy theory; what surprises me is that it isn't more widely believed. How can there be genuine rejoicing in the streets of Belgrade? Haven't countless British politicians and pundits, from both left and right, assured us that President Milosevic enjoys near-universal support in his own country? </p> <p>In May last year, only a few days before the Serb withdrawal from Kosovo, Martin Bell MP told the House of Commons why the Nato intervention had nevertheless failed: \"My feeling is that, as far as his domestic political situation is concerned, Milosevic has been strengthened.\" In the House of Lords, former defence minister Lord Blaker warned that \"the determination of the Serb people to support Mr Milosevic would be increased\". The political journalist Paul Routledge wrote in the Mirror that \"the tyrant Milosevic is still in power, and more popular with his people than ever\", while Times readers learned from Simon Jenkins that \"Mr Milosevic may be 'degraded' but he is politically impregnable\". The Daily Mail agreed: \"There is no doubt the country is now united behind Milosevic.\" </p> <p>A Panorama programme on The Mind of Milosevic interviewed Dr Jerrold Post, who was director of the CIA's political psychology centre from 1989 to 1998. \"I believe,\" he intoned gravely, \"that the Nato strike designed to weaken him will strengthen him and will very much add not only to his support but to his mystique.\" Tony Benn, Henry Kissinger and a large battalion of historians and retired ambassadors claimed that Nato's onslaught had scuppered any chance of a more democratic regime emerging in Belgrade for many years to come. In the words of Denis Healey, \"All observers agree that the bombing has strengthened Milosevic's political position in Yugoslavia.\" </p> <p>Not all observers, actually. On this page last April, I quoted what George Orwell had written in 1940: \"Whereas socialism, and even capitalism in a more grudging way, have said to people, 'I offer you a good time,' Hitler has said to them, 'I offer you struggle, danger and death,' and as a result a whole nation flings itself at his feet. Perhaps later on they will get sick of it and change their minds, as at the end of the last war.\" And so they did; though Hitler's hegemony over his people seemed unchallengeable at the time, as soon as he and his gang were defeated the Germans exorcised the demon and democratised their nation. Was it vain to hope, I wondered, that history might repeat itself? </p> <p>Even during the Nato campaign, Milosevic was never as \"politically impregnable\" as the pundits claimed. At the end of April 1999, deputy prime minister Vuk Draskovic appeared on state television to denounce the president for dragging the nation into a war it couldn't win. Other opposition leaders started demanding Milosevic's resignation, and by early May there was evidence of widespread public discontent: our own Maggie O'Kane reported on it at length, which may be why she was promptly expelled from Belgrade. </p> <p>After the ceasefire of June 1999, it became clearer still that the population which had supposedly flung itself at Milosevic's feet was indeed \"sick of it\". More than 10,000 Serbs took to the streets of Cacak on June 29 to demand the immediate resignation of the dictator. In the southern city of Prokuplje, which had hitherto been regarded as a Milosevic stronghold, only five people turned up on July 8 for the first pro-government demonstration since the end of the Kosovo war - while 4,000 staged a rival rally in the main square, chanting \"Slobo like Saddam\" and \"Slobo out\". A month later, 150,000 anti-Milosevic protesters marched through the centre of Belgrade. The president's downfall had become a question of when, not if. </p> <p>Why, then, did so many allegedly perceptive observers maintain that he was invincibly popular? The answer, I'd guess, is that they took Milosevic at his own estimation. It's an all too common error: throughout the 1990s, he convinced foreign politicians and diplomats that he was the man who could deliver peace in the Balkans, rather than the father of strife. Hence the willingness of successive British foreign secretaries to peddle the fiction that the Bosnian conflict was a \"civil war\", even though they knew perfectly well that it had been instigated and directed from Belgrade. </p> <p>By treating the Butcher of the Balkans as a reasonable statesman who must be accommodated, those grandees who proclaimed their even-handedness - Douglas Hurd, Malcolm Rifkind, David Owen, Sir Michael Rose - proved in effect to be accomplices of Serb aggression, since the beneficiaries of this neutrality were Milosevic and his goon squads. Hurd accidentally gave the game away in April 1993, when explaining why the arms embargo against Bosnia shouldn't be lifted. Although \"at first sight it seems an act of justice\", he said, in practice it would merely create a \"level killing field\". </p> <p>The only possible inference to be drawn was that he preferred an uneven killing field, on which Milo-sevic provided the Bosnian Serbs with troops and weapons while the Bosnian government had to make do with whatever equipment it could buy on the black market or grab from captured enemy soldiers. Confirming this interpretation, Hurd said that allowing the Bosnians to defend themselves would \"only prolong the fighting\". </p> <p>Hurd's successor, Rifkind, continued the tradition of appeasement by default. After the 1997 general election, incoming Labour ministers discovered that he had deliberately prevented the war crimes tribunal in the Hague from obtaining evidence that could prove Milosevic's complicity in genocide - while insisting in public that \"we want to see cooperation with the war crimes tribunal\". </p> <p>Even Labour took some time to abandon the Tories' spurious moral equivalence. As late as January last year, Robin Cook told the House of Commons that although the massacre of Kosovar civilians in Racak was \"a war crime\", the blame \"lies with both sides\". </p> <p>Despite all the atrocities committed by Serb troops and paramilitaries, from Vukovar in 1991 via Srebrenica in 1995 right up to Racak in 1999, international negotiators insisted that Milosevic was \"a man we can do business with\", in the words of the US envoy Richard Holbrooke. (Did Holbrooke know that Neville Chamberlain had used the same phrase after his first meeting with Adolf Hitler?) Although his promises were continually shown to be as flimsy and worthless as a devalued dinar, still the old mantra was recited: Slobo's the chap with whom we can make deals. </p> <p>Literally so, in the case of Hurd and his old Foreign Office colleague, Dame Pauline Neville-Jones, who led the British delegation at the Dayton peace talks. Within months of leaving Whitehall, Hurd and Neville-Jones were breakfasting with Slobo in Belgrade to celebrate a business partnership between his regime and their new employer, NatWest Markets. </p> <p>Where are they now, all these eminent and culpable oafs who so consistently misjudged Milosevic? Shut away in their kitchens, gorging on humble pie? Of course not: this is a breed that knows no shame. Owen could be heard on the World Service last Thursday night, pontificating grandly about the future of Yugoslavia while modestly omitting to mention his own inglorious role in its past. The following morning, Neville-Jones gave Radio 4's Today programme the benefit of her own expertise. </p> <p>Since she is a governor of the BBC, it was probably wise of the interviewer not to ask the obvious question: how dare these ministers and mandarins, who helped Milosevic to stay in power for so long, and to wreak such ghastly havoc, now presume to lecture us on the inevitability of his demise?</p>"
