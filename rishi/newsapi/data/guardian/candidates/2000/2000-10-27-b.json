  "Michigan is not the biggest prize, in terms of electoral college votes, but in this neck-and neck race it offers riches beyond count. In the last two presidential contests, it was solid for the Democrats, but this time it is called a toss-up state, with all the polls suggesting the race is too close to call. <p>Little wonder, then, that George W Bush is campaigning hard in the state, while campaign workers for Al Gore have launched a so-called phone blitz of Michigan voters, bombarding them with recorded messages. </p> <p>The phone campaign could, in fact, backfire. Republicans, who are hopping mad about them, hope they will antagonise voters. </p> <p>In one of the calls, Charlotte Cherry of Houston, Texas, says that \"Governor Bush has accepted $1.3m (\u00a30.9m) from corporate polluters, and he's allowed them to keep polluting while my kids suffer.\" Another Texas caller says Bush signed legislation weakening nursing home regulations. </p> <p>Actor Ed Asner, a strong Gore supporters, has also recorded calls criticising Bush. He warns listeners that \"George W Bush has a proposal that would undermine Social Security, even scuttling current benefits.\" </p> <p>So far, there is little evidence that the phone campaign has swayed voters either way. The <a href=\"http://www.freep.com/\" target=\"_new\">Detroit Free Press</a> today reports that in the state senatorial contest, the Democrat candidate has come from 10% behind two weeks ago, and is now running neck and neck with the Republican incumbent. </p> <p>There is better news for Bush in a fun little news-in-brief about the sales of Halloween masks, which are said to mirror the Presidential election results back to 1972. This year Bush masks are outselling Gore ones, 58% to 42%. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.detnews.com/\" target=\"_new\">Detroit News</a> also runs a poll showing Gore on level pegging with Bush at 42%, with 13% still undecided. But in Detroit itself, it says, Gore is leading by a whopping 80% to 7%. </p> <p>Outside the city, Michigan state is much more equally divided. The <a href=\"http://www.Lenconnect.com\" target=\"_new\">Daily Telegram</a> of Lenawee County eschews all mention of the Presidential race, but devotes a long editorial in praise of the local Republican candidate for re-election to the House of Representatives. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.thehollandsentinel.net\" target=\"_new\">Holland Sentinel</a> has already decided who will next inhabit the White House. It features a syndicated column by Cal Thomas, which starts: \"President George Bush had it in 1992. Bob Dole had it in 1996. Now Al Gore seems to be getting it. It is the political death pall that comes over a presidential candidate when he realizes he probably will lose the election.\" </p> <p>But the bias is not all one way. The <a href=\"http://www.michigandaily.com\" target=\"_new\">Michigan Daily</a>, based in Ann Arbor, highlights the state senatorial contest. It suggests that the steady improvement in the poll fortunes of the Democrat candidate could be good news for Al Gore. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.macombdaily.com/\" target=\"_new\">Macomb Daily</a> focuses on the state legislature elections, endorsing five Democrat candidates and three Republicans.</p>",

Does English literature, or Anglo-American literature, have a special meaning for you?</p> <p><strong>Ruth Prawer Jhabvala:</strong> Well, I was very lucky to come here when I did, I was also very lucky to have the years of doing nothing but reading, mostly English literature. So my whole background is that. It was extremely fortunate for me. Also English became my first language.</p> <p></p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> Do you think studying literature is a better preparation for writing screenplays, or at any rate adapting classics for the screen, than going to film school would be?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Well, I started off and still am primarily a novelist, and not a screen writer. Studying English literature is really not studying - to have all those years to read is a gift. Particularly as I wasn't really very good at anything... It was wonderful to have all those years to read. But I will say that while I was preparing for my degree I never wrote. I wrote before and after, but during those years I just read. I even wrote a thesis on the short story in England from 1700-1750. There weren't any of course but that was my thesis!</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> Do you think that studying literature at university is why you were interested in adapting classics? </p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> I was never interested in adapting classics at all. I've written four novels. I was never interested in film. Never. I never even thought of it. I wasn't even a film buff, I didn't see many films ever. I never thought of it until Merchant Ivory came to India and filmed one of my books - they said 'Why don't you write the screenplay?' and I said, 'Well, I've never written a screenplay and I haven't seen many films', because I was in India by that time and hadn't really had any opportunity to see new films or art films or classic films or anything. So they said, 'Well try. We haven't made a feature film before.' So that was really my introduction into film.</p> <p></p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> Is there a main purpose in adapting classics for film?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> The main purpose is, well, you have to, well the main purpose is that I have such a good time - I mean think of all that marvellous material. Just think of spending all that time in The Golden Bowl and other James and Forster books we have done. But especially Henry James because, not so much in Golden Bowl, but the other two [The Europeans, The Bostonians] - he has such marvellous characters and he has such strong dramatic scenes. You just put your hand in and pull them out.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> There isn't an educational impulse?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> I'm afraid not! Maybe there should be, but I'm afraid I only think of myself.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> I suppose you are trying to communicate your enjoyment?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Yes, yes. I suppose, yes. And in a way it's a homage to a great author. You know I never write any critical articles or critical reviews, never write anything except fiction and screenplays, so it is a kind of homage. But I never think I'm doing a public service or anything... [<strong><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/goldenbowl/102500rpj1.ra\">Soundclip 1</a></strong>]</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> Do you have any idea why American literary classics from the turn of the century seem to be so fashionable at the moment?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Is Henry James particularly fashionable? Well let me think. Well yes, I think so.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> Over the last few years...</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Yes. Well, it is such grand material, wonderful scenes, great characters, such wonderful relationships between the characters - well the material is there.</p> <p></p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> The French director Jacques Rivette said in 1974 that James is one of the 'unfilmable' authors, who 'can be filmed diagonally, taking up their themes, but never literally'. You obviously don't agree... </p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> No, I do agree! Any adaptation you do it diagonally. You can take up the theme but you can never, never, never do it literally. You'd come up with a kind of travesty, if you tried to interpret anything literally.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> But fidelity, is that important?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Fidelity is not the first [thing] No I don't think so. Like I said, the theme and the feel of the characters the ambience and their relationships that is what you try and but never, never literally. </p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> So it's a separate work, really?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> In a way. I'll tell you what I usually do. I read the book several times, usually it's a book I know very well anyway, but I read it several times and make some notes and make a kind of plan that I think I would want to follow - usually I don't, it breaks down at some point - and then I put the book away and really don't look at it again until I've filled out my own thing. And then I look at it again and see what I have missed. But there is a period when the book and I are two separate entities.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> How much changing do you do when you go back to the book at that stage? Or what kinds of things do you change?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Nothing really - usually I find that I look for some poignancy or some scene that might contribute more, that might point something out that should be there in the screenplay. I try and find that. Or even just half a line of dialogue can be a God-send to me at that point.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> How well do you find Henry James' dialogue works?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Well, again, it works diagonally. You really have to transcribe it. He's not the only person - all the others - you can never just take it off the page. However colloquial the language might sound, this is not how actors can speak. [<strong><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/goldenbowl/102500rpj2.ra\">Soundclip 2</a></strong>]</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> Could I ask what you liked or what you didn't like about any of the recent James adaptations?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Well, I like Portrait of a Lady very much, and that was a book we had wanted to do over 20 years ago, but we never had the money for it. We did two other Jameses, it was easier, we started with The Europeans because that was all in America so it was much easier and a much smaller film so it was much easier to raise the money. And then again with The Bostonians, that was all in America, easier for us to shoot. Then other things came in-between and Portrait of a Lady went I'm afraid.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> Did you ever get as far as a script?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> No.</p> <p></p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> I really should congratulate you on making a film, and on getting a film made, of The Golden Bowl at all. Was it hard work getting it made? </p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> To get it made? Um, well, no, we got, well people said 'This is not a good novel' or 'This is not one of Henry James' really good novels'. They didn't want to go ahead with it. But we did get money for the screenplay, money for the development, and once we had that we didn't have too much difficulty.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> How did you pitch the story?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> I wrote a sort of outline of the book - how we were going to see it and a background of the characters - and that's what we sent out. Because I didn't really expect anyone to have read the book. </p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> Was there an emphasis that you thought was central to that?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Well, yes, I think that we said that this was a passionate encounter between four people, and we thought that might sound good to them. So if this had been our first second film or our third film we may have had more difficulty, but we did have a good [track] record, so people came forward and said, \"Well, it may not look like much, but, you know \" [laughs] But certainly if we had started out and it had been an early film, we might have had real difficulties.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> How different is The Golden Bowl to how you would have done it, say, straight after The Europeans?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> I don't think it would have worked so well for me. No, I think I needed a lot more practice, because this was a very difficult script. This was the hardest. This was the nicest and the hardest. The only other one that has been equally difficult and equally rewarding was Mr and Mrs Bridge - I don't know if you know that one, by Evan S. Connell. Well it was two books actually, which we adapted into one. And that was one of my favourite films. But those two were the hardest.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> When Jack Pulman adapted The Golden Bowl for the BBC in 1972, in the famous version directed by James Cellan Jones, with Cyril Cusack, Daniel Massey and Gayle Hunnicutt, they had six 45-minute episodes - a total of four-and-a-half hours. At 130 minutes, your version is only half that length. Are you at all envious?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Oh no, no, no. Not at all. That's the difference between television and film, television rests so much on dialogue, not as visual as a film is. You can develop things much more slowly and carefully. But in a film, I mean you just couldn't do it. I wouldn't want to.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> But were there sections you would have liked to have taken longer on?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> No, not really. We were in a two-hour format. Since we did not have time for four or six hours, I thought, well we might as well adapt ourselves to what we have, and just take the essence of the situation and each incident and turn in the story. We couldn't dwell on it.</p> <p></p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> You obviously have a wonderful working relationship with James Ivory. But late Henry James is notoriously ambiguous and difficult, and no two readers of The Golden Bowl read it quite the same way - in fact, a single reader often sees different things in it at each reading. Did you always see it the same way?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Yeah. I think we must have done. I mean the screenplay - he read it, and he had some objections, but there was nothing fundamental. I don't think we ever had a fundamental difference of opinion.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> Could you talk about how your process of collaboration with James Ivory works?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Well, when I lived in India and he lived in New York, or wherever he was, we did a lot through correspondence. But now we all live in New York... I am still so used to working on my own that I do several drafts for myself first and then send them to him to make marks in the margin. And then I rewrite, and this goes on over a few months. And then finally, before he really starts to get it all together, we sit together and see where we still might have disagreements. Then he goes and shoots the film - I have nothing to do with that - I only go along to see some rushes. But I will see the rough cut, which is usually twice the length of the final version, then I see it again, and we sit in the editing room for some time and, you know, fiddle about.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> So you are involved in the editing?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Yes, I am involved in the editing but not in the actual production, or in the casting. [<strong><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/goldenbowl/102500rpj3.ra\">Soundclip 3</a></strong>]</p> <p>* * * </p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> Whose idea was it to begin the film in Renaissance Italy with the discovery of adultery and the killing of the lovers?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Well, I put that in right from the beginning because I thought to myself, well how am I going to show who this prince is and where he comes from? So I read a lot of books about the Renaissance and I came across a story in which a duke actually does kill a stepmother who was involved with her stepson, so I thought, well that's a good background for this film! You can't do these sort of things in a film, but in television you could, you could say that [just] in dialogue. You know, [a narrator] could sit there and expound and talk about it and everyone could listen, but in a film you just can't do that.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> The duke is one of the ancestors?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Yes. And then there is the slideshow [later in the film], of the families, and then the story of the duke is told.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> Later on, in your story, the role of the duke seems to be closer to Adam Verver.</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Well yes, you know, you're supposed to think that! </p> <p></p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> In the book, the figure of Adam Verver is ambiguous to the end, so that we don't ever really know whether he has any clear idea what's been going on, or whether he's a bit of a simple soul, all of whose subtlety is used solely on his business. In your film it seems to me we know very clearly that he knows [what's going on between his wife and stepson].</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> He's immensely clever. A man doesn't become a billionaire and a patron of the arts if he's dim!</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> So that ambiguity</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> There is no ambiguity. How could he have become a billionaire? In the book he manipulates the entire situation - he and Maggie between them. He in silence, but he knew what everyone else was thinking.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> I was struck by the sympathy with which you presented the predicament of the Ververs who, in much academic criticism since FR Leavis, are taken to be capitalistic vampires, an essentially incestuous father-daughter team, draining the passionate blood from their weaker partners. Do you think there's a sinister side to what the Ververs do in the book that doesn't appear in the film?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Not at all. I think Henry James loved Maggie Verver. He loves her and he enters into her more than any other character in any other novel. All of the passion that she has for the prince, this is Henry James' passion that he has given her. I really don't see this reinterpretation. Though I like Gore Vidal's introduction [to the Penguin edition*] very much, but I didn't really like his thesis that they are the manipulators, and the prince and Charlotte are the victims. In a way they are the victims because they are social victims, because they have nothing and are dependent on them. But that has nothing to do with the character of the Ververs, who are all goodness, and Henry James painted them as goodness, in a way that an earlier Bostonian knows goodness, I think. [<strong><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/goldenbowl/102500rpj4.ra\">Soundclip 4</a></strong>]</p> <p></p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> I admired your courage in actually having the golden bowl itself appear and also be discussed as a symbol. Could you say something about what it means for you?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Well first of all it's an object, we had to have it there, it's a physical object, which one person buys and another does not. The moment when the golden bowl is delivered in the film is also the moment when she [Maggie] discovers about the relationship between Charlotte and her husband. The golden bowl itself - Fanny says she does not believe it - it has a crack, it's damaged, and Fanny says, 'Who would think? It looks so perfect?' And then she [Maggie] says 'yes, a perfect fake'. And that's how she sees the situation that has been created for her, her marriage, and her father's marriage in fact, is a perfect fake. Like the golden bowl. And shortly afterwards [Amerigo] asks, well, 'What do you want?' and she says, 'I want a happiness without a hole in it, I want the bowl without a crack'. So it's a perfect symbol for us, and in the film we do see it.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> You seem to agree with the idea that the man in the shop who sells Maggie the golden bowl, and intervenes decisively in the plot, is Henry James appearing in the action. Am I right?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> No, that was an accident.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> Really? It was an accident? Because many critics think it intentional. [The shop owner] says 'my golden bowl' in a rather emphatic way.</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Yes he does look like [Henry James]. (laughs). But no, I never thought of that. Plus I wasn't there when he was cast.</p> <p></p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> You also seemed to have rethought Prince Amerigo, making him less languid and passive than he appears in the book. I noticed that he drives his own car and has his chauffeur sit in the back; and he even wins a bicycle race. What is the logic behind that?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Well, you can't have a languid central character otherwise why would these two women be in love with him? You need some kind of driving force. [<strong><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/goldenbowl/102500rpj5.ra\">Soundclip 5</a></strong>]</p> <p>* * * </p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> In the first edition of The Portrait of a Lady, Isabel first comes across Mme Merle playing Beethoven on the piano; in the revised edition it's Schubert, a more beautiful, sadder, less stirringly courageous composer. You have Charlotte play Adam Verver a Debussy Sarabande. Does that characterise her? [In the novel she just plays Adam some of his 'favourite things', unnamed (182).]</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> No, not at all. Charlotte plays very badly and Henry James says she plays like you would play a game of tennis, you know, correctly but... Debussy was at that time a modern composer, so... I think in Room With a View we had Schumann a lot</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> Incidentally, you have Fanny near the end of the film tell the story of The Portrait of a Lady as if it's something that's happened to a friend - she's a friend of Isabel Osmond, nee Archer</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> You spotted that? Good! In fact I put it right in, and then she turns round and says, 'That dreadful husband, what was his name?' I had in fact put in his real name, but Jim [Ivory] thought that was going too far... so he used another name.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> Was that a joke?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Well, I thought it was as good a story as any!</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> So that's 20 years after the action of Portrait of a Lady?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Yes.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> Do you think Isabel is happy?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> No, no. I'm afraid not [laughs]. I think this is the one book with a happy ending.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> The Golden Bowl? You think Charlotte is happy?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Well, yes. She is going to be one of these great patronesses of the arts like Isabella in The Bostonians, and he will probably die 20 years before her, and it will all be hers. </p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> Adam and Charlotte do seem here to have a marriage in which sex might happen. Is that right, and is she lying when she says to Amerigo that she will never have children?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> I'm afraid there is something that we had to cut out there. She could not have children. We had that in one scene that we had to drop. In fact two scenes. There was one where she comes back from the doctor's and tells Adam that they all say the same thing, and he says 'Well, you know... '. And then there is another scene where she says, you know, 'I have been to Sir Matthew-this and Sir William-that and they all say the same thing'. She is barren. And in the book she says that she can't have a child but it is not her fault. But we didn't want to undermine Adam Verver's manhood! [laughs] Since we had Nick Nolte! It is very different from the book because in the book Adam Verver is not such a fine figure of a man.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> Is there a literary critic on The Golden Bowl whose work you admire or agree with, or have been influenced by?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> No, I never read about anything, I always read the thing. I read around the social life and where it all came from, but it would disturb me to read other people's opinions I think. I really want to go to the text itself, or to how the text came about - the personal and social circumstances behind it.</p> <p></p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> The book was published in 1904, but your action runs from 1903 to 1909. Were you inspired by the recent [1997] film of The Wings of the Dove, which also pushed its action forward to the end of the Edwardian period in order to get in those modern things - like the ballet you include? What is the ballet?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> It's an invention by an American choreographer called Carol Armitage with whom Jim has worked with before. Our usual composer, Richard Robbins wrote the music.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> So it's a pastiche, like Bernard Herman's pastiche in Citizen Kane, the opera that Kane's second wife performs and fails to hit the top note?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Yes, it's completely a pastiche.</p> <p></p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> So Charlotte likes modern things and Adam doesn't?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Well, he's not very musical anyway, remember when she plays the piano, he's half asleep. Art is his thing, not music. With her everything would tend to be somewhat fashionable, like a woman like that would be today... </p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> So you think she doesn't have a deep appreciation of art?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> I don't think so, no. Although she will, already in the later scenes she has learnt a lot. And certainly when they reach America and start this museum, she is going to make herself a great expert. </p> <p>* * *</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> When Maggie brings the book out to Charlotte in the garden at the end, you introduce a detail that's not in the novel. Charlotte comments, 'I read something else by the same author. I found it rather contrived.' Is the book meant to be a book by James?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> No! No, absolutely not. 'But the social scenes are well done', that's the next bit [of their conversation]. But no, absolutely not, never.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> I thought it might be James, because Charlotte wouldn't understand James.</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> No, no. I wouldn't do that.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> Would Charlotte like James if she had read him?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Well, she might like early James - Daisy Miller - up to, well not The Europeans, too American, but the early ones that were really popular. She might even have read Portrait of a Lady - she's not a fool, although they do say a lot in the book that she's really stupid, and compared with the others perhaps she is, but she does have her wits about her.</p> <p></p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> When they go to see [art dealer] Mr Guterman-Seuss, in the book it's supposed to be Brighton but you made it Camberwell. Why?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Well, we didn't want to take a trip to Brighton, and some London suburb was easier. In fact we did have a scene where he laid out the tiles and Adam Verver sees how appreciative Charlotte is of it and that bring him closer to proposing - as he did in Brighton - but we had to cut that scene out in editing. A lot gets lost! But you don't regret it afterwards, you really don't feel regret for the scenes that have gone.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> What other scenes were cut at editing stage?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Oh, many! [laughs] Very, very many. At the beginning there were scenes about inviting Charlotte to stay at Fawns and how poor she is, and the prince listens to all of this, and how she had a great romance with somebody but no-one knows who it is, and the poor prince is having to sit there... but all that went. We don't cut scenes out because of length, we just want the scenes that really work for us. If you only have two hours the essence is what you come down to.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> Do you have any other James adaptations in mind?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> No, I don't think so. I think that The Golden Bowl is the ultimate for him, it's his last novel... so I don't think I'd particularly want to. There's none that I could think of now that I would want to do.

  "According to its publicity brochure, the Excelsior Hotel in Little Rock is a place \"where something important happens every day\", and, judging by the attendance, Al Gore's speech there on a hot southern morning this week seemed to live up to the claim. <p>Gore spoke with authority and passion about the case for a smaller, smarter federal government machine.</p> <p>No politician in modern US history has a better claim in this field than Gore. He pioneered it. He understands it. He believes in it. And he is interested in it. For Gore, the search for good government is something of a mission.</p> <p>But Gore's speech at the Excelsior summed up a lot of the Democratic nominee's wider problem as he battles to clamber past George W Bush's narrow but persistent lead in the presidential election.</p> <p>It was a microcosm of what is going wrong for Gore. He was giving the speech not because he wanted to, but because he had to.</p> <p>During the three presidential debates, Bush had managed to pin a 'big government' label on Gore.</p> <p>Like much of what Bush says, it was untrue. But like everything that Bush says, it served a purpose. The label stuck, and Gore's task this week was to shake himself free of it.</p> <p>As Gore spoke in the Excelsior, one's mind occasionally wandered up a few floors in the same building to something else important that happened in the hotel some nine and a half years ago.</p> <p>That was the day when a woman called Paula Jones was working on the registration desk at a conference in the Excelsior. Early in the afternoon, she got a message from an Arkansas state trooper that Governor Bill Clinton wanted to talk to her upstairs in his suite.</p> <p>She went upstairs - and the rest is history. (Though she famously told the governor that afternoon \"I'm not that kind of girl\", Paula Jones appears in a nude photospread in this month's Penthouse.)</p> <p>What happened in the hotel on May 8 1991 goes a long way towards explaining one of Gore's other big problems.</p> <p>In his speech in the Excelsior, Gore twice mentioned that he had been a member of the Clinton-Gore administration.</p> <p>Presumably this was out of deference to his Arkansas audience, since it was two more mentions of the word \"Clinton\" than Gore normally makes in his stump speeches. Normally, he's just not that kind of boy.</p> <p>Gore's patent reluctance to having Clinton join him on the campaign trail has created massive anger in the White House and among Clinton's acolytes.</p> <p>The issue has been simmering at boiling point for several weeks, and Clinton himself has occasionally shown that he is straining to get out there to drum up the votes.</p> <p>But Gore is cautious for a reason. His polls tell him that Clinton is a double-edged weapon. People like the policies, but they mostly do not like the man, and Gore knows better than anyone that, if the two of them were to appear together on the stump, Clinton would eclipse him.</p> <p>Clinton, not Gore, would become the story. That, of course, is precisely what the Republicans want.</p> <p>It's important to remember that Gore's best phase of the campaign - possibly his only good phase at all - came after the Los Angeles Democratic convention when he strode up to the podium and said \"I stand here tonight as my own man.\"</p> <p>The weeks that followed were the one period in the election when Gore has enjoyed a clear lead over Bush.</p> <p>That's not to say that there is no vanity and pride involved for Gore in keeping Clinton at arm's length. There is. But his strategy makes sense for other reasons too.</p> <p>Next week, Clinton will finally be allowed out on to the campaign trail. He will go to California next Wednesday and will barnstorm through a series of other states in the days between then and election day, November 7.</p> <p>Other states under consideration by the Democrats include Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri and Kentucky. But at no point will he stand on the same platform as Gore.</p> <p>Notice, though, what kind of role Clinton will play. His task will be an attempt to woo middle-of-the-road voters, as many of the Clintonites might like to imagine. Bush has won those voters away now.</p> <p>Clinton's task will be to mobilise the core Democratic vote, especially the black and ethnic minority votes, and to ensure they do not turn to Ralph Nader.</p> <p>In the end, for the Democrats, this election is coming down to a desperate attempt to rally the traditional party around Gore.</p> <p>Unless they succeed, Bush looks increasingly like the winner.</p> <p><b>Email</b><br> <a href=\"mailto:martin.kettle@theguardian.com\">martin.kettle@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Related special reports</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/US_election_race/0,2759,376727,00.html\">US election race</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/usguns/0,2759,182056,00.html\">Gun violence in America</a></p> <p><b>Interactive quiz</b> <a href=\" http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/quiz/questions/0,5961,387782,00.html\">Do you know your Bushisms?</a></p> <p><b>Other articles:</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=%28martin+kettle%29AND+%28VdkPublicationDate+%3E%3D+01%2DSep%2D1998%29&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=score+Desc&amp;Query=martin+kettle&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv=\">More articles by Martin Kettle</a></p> <p><b>Useful links </b><br> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/\" target=\"_new\">The Washington Post</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.AlGore2000.com/\" target=\"_new\">Al Gore official site</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.georgewbush.com/\" target=\"_new\">George W Bush official site</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.votenader.com/\" target=\"_new\">Ralph Nader official site</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.gwbush.com/\" target=\"_new\">Spoof: GWBush.com</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.algore-2000.org/\" target=\"_new\">Spoof: Al Gore 2000</a> <br><a href=\" http://www.mediaresearch.org/news/goregaffesvideo.html\" target=\"_new\">Al Gore gaffe videos</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/\" target=\"_new\">The White House</a><a> <br></a><a href=\"http://www.capsteps.com/\" target=\"_new\">Capitol Steps political satire</a></p>",
  "Casting himself as a leader untainted by political cynicism or partisan hostility, George W Bush made his most personal attack so far on Al Gore yesterday, signalling a rough turn in the presidential election campaign as the two men battle for advantage in what the opinion polls say is going to be the closest White House contest for a generation. <p>Speaking in Pittsburgh, he accused Mr Gore of being \"bitter and negative\", and depicted himself as the man who could set a new tone of \"civility and bipartisanship\" in Washington. </p> <p>As he did so, his taxation and spending plans - the centrepiece of his policy appeal - ran into one of the most influential challenges it has yet faced. </p> <p>\"Bush is very much overspending Gore,\" the senior pensions expert at the American Academy of Actuaries, Ron Gebhardtsbauer, said after a panel from the academy assessed both candidates' budget plans. </p> <p>But it was the attack on Mr Gore that captured the headlines rather than the possibility that Mr Bush might himself be indulging in the \"fuzzy maths\" with which he has taunted his Democratic opponent. </p> <p>\"My opponent's campaign is a fitting close to the Clinton-Gore years,\" Mr Bush said, as the majority of the national polls continued to show him narrowly ahead of Mr Gore. </p> <p>\"They're going out as they came in. Their guide, the nightly polls; their goal, the morning headlines; their legacy, the fruitless search for a legacy.\" </p> <p>Speaking confidently, to the frequent accompaniment of cheers from supporters, he accused Mr Gore of setting a confrontational tone. </p> <p>\"He talked about ripping the lungs out of political adversaries. Part of his campaign headquarters is called, incredibly enough, 'the slaughterhouse', and his staff proudly calls itself a band - and I quote - of 'killers'. </p> <p>\"That's political killers, of course.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile the non-partisan group of financial experts from the Academy of Actuaries was delivering its damaging judgment. </p> <p>Mr Bush's budget plans, the panel found, would force the US back into annual deficits after he leaves office. </p> <p>His published commitment to cut taxes and switch pension contributions into personal accounts would mean that the government could no longer meet its financial commitments without going into the red from around the year 2015. </p> <p>The actuaries calculated that Mr Bush's plans would make it all but impossible for the US to eliminate its national debt, a goal to which both main parties have officially subscribed ever since the current account of the federal budget moved into surplus two years ago. </p> <p>The Bush campaign team says its projections show that it can eliminate the federal debt by 2016. </p> <p>Mr Gore has promised to achieve this by 2012, a pledge which the actuaries say can be fulfilled, on the basis of their published figures. </p> <p>\"I don't see any way they [the Bush plans] pay off the public debt,\" Mr Gebhardtsbauer said. </p> <p>\"In 2015, the budget will go negative. There won't be a surplus any more.\" </p> <p>The actuaries said they were not taking sides in the election but applying standard evaluation techniques to the plans and rhetoric of the two campaigns. </p> <p>Mr Gebhardtsbauer said that the only way the Bush campaign could make good its claims would be by double-counting the equity building up in pension accounts. </p> <p>The actuaries, a professionally conservative group, also said that Mr Gore's budget plan was much more accurate and specific than Mr Bush's. The Bush team has so far produced only broad outlines of its intentions, Mr Gebhardtsbauer said. </p> <p>A statement from Mr Gore said: \"The numbers don't add up.\" Mr Bush was promising \"the same trillion dollars to two different groups of people\", he said.</p>",
  "Lawyers in Washington are openly hinting at dirty tricks by the George W Bush campaign in one of the most curious mysteries of this year's presidential contest. <p>Six weeks ago, one of Al Gore's advisers, Tom Downey, received a videotape in the post showing Mr Bush taking part in a rehearsal for the televised presidential debates. </p> <p>The video, which was shot at Mr Bush's Texas ranch, was confirmed as genuine by the Bush campaign when the incident came to light. </p> <p>At first, Mr Downey, a former Democratic congressman, assumed the video had been sent by a secret Gore sympathiser in the Bush camp in Austin, Texas. He passed the tape to his lawyer, Marc Miller, who has now complained to the FBI that there could be a more devious motive - an attempt by the Bush to plant the tape itself and suggest that the Gore campaign might be cheating. </p> <p>In his letter to the FBI director, Louis Freeh, Mr Miller says: \"It now appears to be more likely than not that the original transmission of the material to Mr Downey was not in fact a misguided act of a single person acting alone _ but rather the concerted, intentional act by more than one person associated with the Bush campaign.\" </p> <p>Sources familiar with the investigation say their suspicions have been aroused by curious circumstantial factors, among them the apparently relaxed view the Bush camp has taken about the possibility of a Gore \"mole\" in its midst. </p> <p>Suspicion in the case has centred on Yvette Lozano, an assistant to Mark McKinnon, one of Mr Bush's senior media strategists. Ms Lozano was seen by a closed circuit camera mailing a package from the Texas post office from which Mr Downey received the video. As far as is known, she still remains on Mr McKinnon's payroll. </p> <p>Both sides in the presidential contest remain on constant alert for possible dirty tricks perpetrated by the other. </p> <p>Only yesterday, the Bush campaign cried foul when the US National Archives released new White House tapes from the Richard Nixon era, three of which featured conversations involving Mr Bush's father, George Bush Sr, who was then representative to the UN.</p>",

  "When Milosevic fell in the same week that fighting broke out between Israelis and Palestinians, was this merely a matter of the coincidence of bad news and good news that always marks human affairs? What are we to make of this arrival of peace in one place and loss of it in another? The difference between the good and the bad news is not as great as it might seem, and not only because the problems are far from over in the Balkans or because something may be patched up in the Middle East. In the one case, flawed policy just barely achieved a kind of success, and, in the other, flawed policy has led to a tragic failure. The flaws, too, were of a similar order - policy driven by domestic pressures, policy that paid too little attention to the facts on the ground, and policy too wary of difficulties and costs. <p>A decade that began in an atmosphere of great confidence in many countries and across the political spectrum has ended with a sharp reminder of limits and an unmistakable loss of momentum. Remember that good was supposed to build on good. A peace in one place would lead to a peace in another, a successful intervention in one region could be a model for others elsewhere, and the gradual accretion of new international institutions would eventually change the framework in which all societies made their decisions. The hope was for synergy. Failures certainly littered the decade - the Rwandas and Srebrenicas, the downward plunge of the Russian economy, the Asian economic crash, and all the rest of it - but for those keeping score it was possible to feel that the successes were the precedents rather than the other way round. </p> <p>The change now may be a diminishing of that sense that a broad improvement is under way. Consider how attitudes to \"people power\" have shifted. In Serbia and now in the Ivory Coast the removal of a leader who had lost, or never enjoyed, legitimacy may be welcomed - but \"people power\" is not seen as the magic potion that it once seemed to be. Indeed, in the Philippines, one of people power's most striking successes, we may be coming round for a second dose, and, if so, it will be with a certain weariness. </p> <p>The sense of foreboding arises at this moment in part because this decade was Bill Clinton's decade and in part because his presidency is finishing with such a defeat in the Middle East. Clinton's departure will mark the end, if not of an era, at least of a time when the United States had extraordinary opportunities which are unlikely to reoccur. Clinton was a world leader in a way in which neither George Bush or Al Gore can be in the future. This was because America had a capital of influence and power when he took over which is now much drawn down. Much of the world was awed, ready to listen, and, up to a point, ready to be persuaded. </p> <p>But America under Clinton did not use its influence to the full or to the best effect, whether in the Far East, south Asia, Russia, or in the Balkans. Above all, in the Middle East it was by turns serious and timorous in its campaign to isolate and bring down Saddam Hussein and it was slow and often partial in its mediation between Israelis and Palestinians. In the dismal towns of the West Bank and Gaza the bitterness which led to the collapse of the peace process was meanwhile brewing. The daily bombing of Iraq, now an activity entirely divorced from any coherent strategy for dealing with that country, is one index of America's failure. The savage daily encounters between Israeli and Palestinian young men, boys who grew up during these Clinton years, is another. Perhaps American power to change the Middle East was not as great as it seemed. But Clinton was not the man to test it to the limit. His successor will find it hard indeed to mend matters and may not seriously try. </p> <p> If these were the years in which America failed to live up to its potential, that was also true of Europe, which notoriously mishandled the crisis in former Yugoslavia. But America and Europe together did, in the end, adopt policies which halted the Serbian campaign in Bosnia and later forced a withdrawal from Kosovo, which in turn contributed to Milosevic's fall. A new report by an independent international commission charts how Kosovo was allowed to fester to the point where Serbian suppression of rebellion provoked Nato intervention. It allows that this intervention was \"illegal but legitimate\". In its broader conclusions, it states in a measured way the need for early engagement in the kind of situations which could produce violations of human rights on a scale that may later give grounds for a humanitarian military intervention. If, as a last resort, such intervention becomes necessary, it proposes \"a principled framework\" for it, which it would like the United Nations to take up in some way. These are of course sound conclusions, to which a UN secretary general such as Kofi Annan will be sympathetic and some of which he has already anticipated in other reports he has commissioned. </p> <p>What is striking about the Kosovo report, like those others, for all their criticism of the behaviour of governments and international organisations, is their essential optimism. They look to a managed world, in which most disasters are headed off by preventative action, and others are dealt with, when they have to be, by the judicious use of force. But whether the US after Clinton, or a muddled European Union, uncertain of its own course and far from agreed on external policies, are in a position to learn the lessons laid out is another question. In any case, the potentially grave regional crises which the world could face, such as a further breakdown in the Middle East, a confrontation between nuclear armed India and Pakistan over Kashmir, or a clash between China and Taiwan, are of an order in which humanitarian expeditions are irrelevant. It is only in the context of the containment of these larger conflicts that these lesser, internal problems may be amenable to solution. </p> <p>One lesson that has been understood is that such quarrels are more obdurate than is sometimes lightly assumed. Europe's less than inspired efforts to deal with its Balkan problem were, with American help, eventually successful, but only just. They absorbed the European Union's energies and distracted it from other tasks. The United States took especial responsibility - to the point of largely excluding other outside powers - for the Middle East and has nevertheless brought it to the present pass. The past 10 years should have been a time when the US and Europe, the two wealthiest and most developed regions, took a strong grip on affairs. Instead they have come perilously close to losing it. </p> <p><b>The Kosovo Report, The Independent International Commission on Kosovo, Oxford.</b></p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martin.woollacott@theguardian.com\">martin.woollacott@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Michigan is not the biggest prize, in terms of electoral college votes, but in this neck-and neck race it offers riches beyond count. In the last two presidential contests, it was solid for the Democrats, but this time it is called a toss-up state, with all the polls suggesting the race is too close to call. <p>Little wonder, then, that George W Bush is campaigning hard in the state, while campaign workers for Al Gore have launched a so-called phone blitz of Michigan voters, bombarding them with recorded messages. </p> <p>The phone campaign could, in fact, backfire. Republicans, who are hopping mad about them, hope they will antagonise voters. </p> <p>In one of the calls, Charlotte Cherry of Houston, Texas, says that \"Governor Bush has accepted $1.3m (\u00a30.9m) from corporate polluters, and he's allowed them to keep polluting while my kids suffer.\" Another Texas caller says Bush signed legislation weakening nursing home regulations. </p> <p>Actor Ed Asner, a strong Gore supporters, has also recorded calls criticising Bush. He warns listeners that \"George W Bush has a proposal that would undermine Social Security, even scuttling current benefits.\" </p> <p>So far, there is little evidence that the phone campaign has swayed voters either way. The <a href=\"http://www.freep.com/\" target=\"_new\">Detroit Free Press</a> today reports that in the state senatorial contest, the Democrat candidate has come from 10% behind two weeks ago, and is now running neck and neck with the Republican incumbent. </p> <p>There is better news for Bush in a fun little news-in-brief about the sales of Halloween masks, which are said to mirror the Presidential election results back to 1972. This year Bush masks are outselling Gore ones, 58% to 42%. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.detnews.com/\" target=\"_new\">Detroit News</a> also runs a poll showing Gore on level pegging with Bush at 42%, with 13% still undecided. But in Detroit itself, it says, Gore is leading by a whopping 80% to 7%. </p> <p>Outside the city, Michigan state is much more equally divided. The <a href=\"http://www.Lenconnect.com\" target=\"_new\">Daily Telegram</a> of Lenawee County eschews all mention of the Presidential race, but devotes a long editorial in praise of the local Republican candidate for re-election to the House of Representatives. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.thehollandsentinel.net\" target=\"_new\">Holland Sentinel</a> has already decided who will next inhabit the White House. It features a syndicated column by Cal Thomas, which starts: \"President George Bush had it in 1992. Bob Dole had it in 1996. Now Al Gore seems to be getting it. It is the political death pall that comes over a presidential candidate when he realizes he probably will lose the election.\" </p> <p>But the bias is not all one way. The <a href=\"http://www.michigandaily.com\" target=\"_new\">Michigan Daily</a>, based in Ann Arbor, highlights the state senatorial contest. It suggests that the steady improvement in the poll fortunes of the Democrat candidate could be good news for Al Gore. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.macombdaily.com/\" target=\"_new\">Macomb Daily</a> focuses on the state legislature elections, endorsing five Democrat candidates and three Republicans.</p>"
