  "<p>He may be on his way to superstar status - a film debut alongside Brenda Blethyn in Saving Grace, a burgeoning double-act with Dylan Moran in Channel 4's latest cult sitcom, Black Books - yet still Bill Bailey in the flesh looks like a Hawkwind roadie on a bad night. </p> <p>This is not the only horrifying aspect of Bailey's all-new, post-Edinburgh tour. There is Carol Vorderman's saliva, for example, which Bailey has sampled from her consonant announcments on Countdown and gleefully replays at great amplification and reduced speed until it sounds like Richard Whitely being boiled in his own gastric juices. </p> <p>Then there is an entire improvised section inspired by an afternoon visit to the dungeon-theme museum opposite the theatre. \"I wanted to see the Pit of Despair\" he complains. \"But it was shut. Still, I spent some quality time in the Cafe of Misery and the Gift Shop of Disillusionment\". </p> <p>If there is anything resembling a theme to this year's show it's the concept of time; and if there's anything wrong with that it's because, in Bailey's company, it disappears too quickly. Alarmed at the apparent brevity of the first half, the audience could be seen checking their watches to discover that Bailey had been on stage for a good 50 minutes. It is simply that an hour at the speed of Bailey's thought seems barely the length of a quick tea-break. </p> <p>Perhaps it's because Bailey has been reading a Brief History of Time - in the spirit, he explains, of relaxed empiricism, whereby if someone vaguely describes what might have been the case he is prepared to believe it. So if Steven Hawking concludes that the universe is saddle-shaped, he'll accept that on the basis that Hawking is the cleverest man on the planet. </p> <p>Surprisingly, Bailey spends more of this show behind a mic stand than at his synthesiser: which is a pity, because the sheer joy of hearing him mutate the Moonlight Sonata into a cockney knees-up cannot be surpassed. Nevertheless, his aural demonstration of the ambulance sirens of Europe is a new tour-de-force. \"Out of the way everyone\", it seems to proclaim: \"baldy-beardy genius sauntering through\". </p> <p>\u0095 Bill Bailey is at the Junction, Cambridge (01223 511 511), tomorrow, then tours to Sheffield and Leeds.</p>",
  "The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, sat face to face at a table with the US president, Bill Clinton, and other leaders at the Middle East emergency summit in Egypt today. \"We have to move beyond blame,\" Mr Clinton declared. <p>The atmosphere this afternoon remained tense as clashes continued in the Middle East, while the two leaders, who have yet to meet bilaterally, gathered in the resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.</p> <p>At the beginning of the summit, Mr Clinton declared: \"We cannot afford to fail.\" </p> <p>The sombre-faced leaders posed silently for photographs and Mr Clinton ignored a reporter's question about prospects for the meeting before making his opening statement. </p> <p>\"The future of the peace process and the stability of the region are at stake,\" Mr Clinton said, urging both sides to remember how far they had come since 1993 when they agreed to resume the peace process. </p> <p>The summit was called to end the recent mayhem on the West Bank and Gaza that has cost nearly 100 lives and fractured whatever trust remained between Israel and the Palestinians. </p> <p>On a key issue, Mr Clinton called for a fact-finding mission to probe the causes of the most serious fighting between the Israelis and Palestinians in years and to prevent a recurrence. \"We want to get negotiations started again,\" he said. </p> <p>The Egyptian president and host of the summit, Hosni Mubarak, called for \"saving what is left of the credibility of the peace process\". </p> <p>After Mr Clinton and Mr Mubarak made opening remarks, the meeting took a recess. </p> <p>Each country's team kept to itself. Mr Barak stood up and talked to his advisers. Mr Clinton turned in his chair to speak to the national security adviser, Sandy Berger, and the secretary of state, Madeleine Albright. </p> <p>The leaders sat about 10 feet apart around a horseshoe table, with Mr Clinton and Mr Mubarak sitting at the head of the table. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Palestinian militiamen opened fire on Israeli soldiers during two West Bank protest marches, and rock-throwing clashes erupted elsewhere in the Palestinian territories.</p> <p>Two Palestinians were seriously injured by Israeli fire, Palestinian doctors said. </p> <p>South of the West Bank town of Nablus, around 1,500 Palestinians marched toward an Israeli army checkpoint.</p> <p>Around 500 broke away from the march and began throwing stones at three Israeli army jeeps. Several gunmen, shooting from olive groves, fired on Israeli soldiers, drawing return fire.</p> <p>Eight Palestinians were injured in total, including the two who were in a serious condition with bullets to the head and chest respectively, said a doctor at a Palestinian field clinic. </p> <p>On the outskirts of the West Bank town of Ramallah, Palestinian gunmen opened fire on Israeli soldiers manning a checkpoint. </p> <p>Across the West Bank and Gaza strip, thousands of Palestinians joined protests against a renewal of contacts with Israel. </p> <p>With a little more than three months left in his presidency, Mr Clinton still hopes to broker a peace accord. But for this summit, the most optimistic outlook is for a truce and a date set for new negotiations between the two sides. </p> <p>\"We shouldn't give it all up for what has happened in the last few weeks,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Barak was first to arrive for the emergency summit at the Egyptian Red Sea spa report, followed by Mr Clinton and Mr Arafat. </p> <p>Also at the emergency summit were King Abdullah of Jordan, the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, and Javier Solana, the EU security chief. </p> <p>Mr Arafat, Mr Barak and Mr Clinton each met separately with Mr Mubarak before the summit gathering. </p> <p>Mr Clinton hopes to return home in time for a memorial service on Wednesday in Norfolk, Virginia, to honour the 17 US sailors killed in an attack last Thursday on a US destroyer at the southern tip of the Arabian peninsula.</p>",
  "<p>Gary Oldman is apparently furious with Stephen Spielberg's DreamWorks company for turning his new political drama <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0208874\">The Contender</a> into a propaganda film for the Democrats.</p> <p>The film, which opened in the States last Friday, stars Jeff Bridges as a dying US president about to hand the reins of power over to his female deputy Joan Allen. </p> <p><a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Oldman,+Gary\">Oldman</a> appears as an extreme right-wing Republican congressman, who tries to dig up dirt on Allen in the hope that the administration will collapse.</p> <p>However, Oldman claims the film, directed by Rod Lurie, has been \"tampered\" with and \"dumbed down\" according to <a href=\"http://www.ananova.com/entertainment/story/sm_84257.html?nav_src=\" target=\"-NEW\">Ananova</a></p> <p>Oldman has apparently told friends that DreamWorks, which is run by Spielberg, David Geffen and ex-Disney chief Jeffrey Katzenberg, had turned the story into a \"propaganda exercise\". </p> <p>A friend said: \"He thought they were getting a message across about The System.

  "The second big presidential debate was like nothing so much as the Charge of the Light Brigade at Balaclava in 1854. Instructed to seize the guns, the 600 rode suicidally in the wrong direction, and Al Gore did the same when he faced George Bush in Boston. The guns he seized were his own. He sacrificed his superior knowledge and experience on all aspects of policy. He fell over himself to assure the watching millions that he agreed with Bush on this and that. And when Bush laid himself open to charges of ignorance and hypocrisy, Gore spared him. <p>It was the most depressing spectacle and a disservice to the several million fence-sitters who will decide who will be the next president. </p> <p>How did it come about? Everybody and the polls agreed the day after the first debate that Gore won easily. Then three things conspired to change the result, manifest in a sharp rise in the polls for Bush. First, instant replay. When it came to anything other than a vacuous generalisation in that first debate, Bush was open mouthed like a fish gasping for air. The trouble was Gore showed his contempt by rolling his eyes and shaking his head. In the week following, television replayed this image without illustrating the provocation. \"Where were the man's manners?\" became a staple of conversation, instead of focusing the question on Bush: \"Where was the man's mind?\" </p> <p>Next, the Dick Cheney-Joe Lieberman encounter. The press and the Democrats had written off Cheney, but he scored big time. His directness and dry wit were much more convincing than the treacly lovefest Lieberman initiated with his friend \"Dick\". It was hailed as a gentleman's discourse but it had no virtue except that, for the Republicans, it blurred the differences. </p> <p> And then, the Republican war room swung into action and scored a major success with a lazy press. Once again, caught in story mode syndrome, they pounded a drumbeat all week on the narrative line that Gore is a liar. </p> <p>Gore's staff panicked. They made him watch a parody of his debating style from television's Saturday Night Live. They abjured him to avoid anecdotes where he might misstep. Gore would indeed have been well advised to make a small correction in his style towards deference, but he over-compensated. Unlike Bill Clinton, he is tone deaf to nuance. He did not merely control his facial reactions; he put his brain on ice. He grovelled. He was utterly out of character for two-thirds of the debate and it represented a sell-out to his convictions. There were cheers across the land when he woke from his sycophantic narcolepsy, but it was too late. </p> <p>And now to the campaign on lying that so rattled the Democrats. The first thing to note is that the people calling Gore a liar are liars themselves. The Gore \"lies\" are not so much lies as irrelevant and inconsequential misremembering of circumstance. No, on one particular visit to a Texas forest fire he was not accompanied by the director, but by a deputy. But yes he did visit Texas disaster areas many times and that was the point. </p> <p>The main attack by the Republican spin machine has proven false itself. Gore quoted a newspaper report about a girl who had to stand up because she had no desk at school. The school principal, embarrassed by the revelation, denied it and the credulous national media accepted that denial as evidence of a Gore fib without any further inquiries. In fact, as the Sarasota Herald Tribune has made clear, a dramatic budget cut has high school students going without desks for weeks. Good politics for the Republicans maybe, but lousy journalism. </p> <p>The most sickening thing about the Republican fib factory is that while the moralisers have been regurgitating the propaganda, they have ignored really substantive lies by Bush. Forget amazing small errors like saying, with glee, that Texas would execute three men for a hate crime, when it's two men, and he is supposed to stand aloof pending appeals. There are examples of his mendacity - or his faculty for memory-loss and myth-making - that will affect people's lives. He said in the debate that he is in favour of hate-crime laws, but he has rejected them in Texas. He asserted that the percentage of people insured for health was going up in Texas but down nationally when both have risen. He described the Kyoto agreement on global warming as imposing controls only on the US, but it is multilateral. He says he is for clean air, but has given in to the polluters in his own state. He said he favours checks on guns bought at shows, but rejects the three-day waiting period that would enable them to be effective. He says he will pay for popular new programmes by using a quarter of the budget surplus, but his own budget shows he has allocated less than half that much. </p> <p>Will the real Al Gore stand up before America sells itself short to the spinners? </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "President Bill Clinton arrives in Egypt today to try to salvage an Israeli-Palestinian summit from a failure that could resonate far beyond the region. <p>On the eve of the summit in the Egyptian resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh, Israeli and Palestinian officials said they hoped for little more than a verbal understanding to end 18 days of rocket attacks, gunbattles and mob rule. The violence claimed its 100th victim yesterday, when a man died of a head wound in the West Bank city of Ramallah. </p> <p>As for the seven-year peace process, Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, told his cabinet that it was all but dead. \"In the end, we will make peace with the Palestinians, but the current Palestinian leadership is now showing that it is finding it very difficult to make the decisions related to an agreement,\" a cabinet statement said yesterday. </p> <p>And so from the peace of the brave promised seven years ago when the process began, at Sharm el-Sheikh today it comes down to a ceasefire for the desperate. The summit guest list in itself reflects the gravity of a crisis that has spread far beyond the West Bank and Gaza, sparking angry protests from Jordan to Indonesia and attacks on synagogues in Europe. </p> <p>In addition to President Clinton, Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general, and the European Union's Javier Solana, King Abdullah of Jordan and the Egyptian host, Hosni Mubarak - now on the defensive in the Arab world for having made a separate peace with Israel - will be marshalling their efforts to pull both sides back from the brink of all-out war. </p> <p>\"The crisis is not confined to the Palestinian territories or Israel but it threatens the whole region and extends beyond,\" Mr Annan said yesterday after meeting the Egyptian president yesterday. </p> <p>Although the day brought a relative lull in the violence, tensions in the region remain high. In Beirut, the Hizbullah guerrilla group said that it had captured a colonel in Israeli intelligence. </p> <p>In Jerusalem, a spokesman said the hostage was a businessman of Arab extraction who had been kidnapped in Europe. </p> <p>Israeli officials warned of a risk of bombing attacks. In the Jordan valley, meanwhile, two Israeli soldiers were wounded when Jordanian soldiers fired across the frontier. </p> <p>The summit, which could last for two days, is an enterprise handicapped from the outset. Mr Arafat's attendance is the result of intense pressure from Washington, and his mere presence at Sharm is fiercely opposed by his people. </p> <p>Palestinian gunmen fired automatic rifles into the air outside Mr Arafat's office in Gaza last night to express their opposition. Mr Arafat came to the gate of the compound to explain his decision to the 200-strong crowd. </p> <p>\"We are going to Sharm el-Sheik, but taking with us the condition of the Palestinian people,\" he said. \"We are on the way to Jerusalem until a Palestinian child raises the Palestinian flag on the walls of Jerusalem.\" </p> <p>The crowd cheered, chanting: \"With our blood, and with our soul, we will defend you.\" </p> <p>Earlier, Mahdi Abdul Hadi, a Palestinian analyst, said: \"Our blood is still fresh in the street, we are in a state of mourning, there are black flags on our houses. We have awakened all the horses in the Arab world. Why should Arafat turn up alone, and on a donkey? Why should we go to a summit whose main purpose is to save Barak?\" </p> <p>Mr Barak also has precious little room for manoeuvre, having opened negotiations with the rightwing Likud party to form an emergency government, an act that would definitively kill off the peace process. </p> <p>Yesterday, Likud leaders said they would stay out if Mr Barak attempted to restart negotiations with Mr Arafat at today's summit. </p> <p>The Israeli prime minister's demands, which were announced yesterday, reflect that hardening of positions. They include: an immediate end to the violence; the rearrest of Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants released at the weekend; punishment for Palestinian police and members of Mr Arafat's Fatah organisation who opened fire on Israeli soldiers; censorship of the Palestinian media, whom the Israelis accuse of inciting the violence; and preservation of Jewish pilgrimage sites at Nablus and Jericho, which have been attacked by Palestinians. </p> <p>Mr Arafat met one condition by putting 34 Hamas militants back in jail. </p> <p>However, he issued demands of his own: for Israel to withdraw its forces from the outskirts of Palestinian cities, and to end the closure of the West Bank and Gaza which has cut people off from the jobs in Israel that are the lifeline of the local economy. Mr Arafat also wants an international protection force, which Israel will certainly reject, and an international investigation into the violence, the demand that scuppered the last attempt to broker a ceasefire. </p> <p>\"I honestly don't want to raise anyone's expectations and I don't have high expectations myself,\" said Saeb Erekat, a Palestinian negotiator. \"I think the situation is going to be nightmarish.\" </p> <p>President Clinton's challenge now will be to reconcile those opposing demands, especially the divisions over the call for an international in quiry which wrecked the summit in Paris between Mr Barak and Mr Arafat. </p> <p>If he fails, he risks the implosion of his Middle East diplomacy in the runup to the US presidential election on November 7, and the disastrous consequences from a unilateral declaration of Palestinian independence, on November 15 or later. </p> <p>On Saturday, Mr Clinton expressed deep regret that the peace process he has nurtured throughout his presidency has all but collapsed. \"We've had this terrible turn of events in the Middle East, which has really been heartbreaking for me,\" he said. \"I've seen so much progress in the last seven and a half years, so it's been very painful.\" </p> <p><b>Big names at the talks</b></p> <p>The main participants in the summit at Sharm el-Sheikh today are likely to be: </p> <p><b> Bill Clinton</b> US president </p> <p><b> Ehud Barak</b> Israeli prime minister </p> <p><b> Yasser Arafat</b> Palestinian president </p> <p><b> Hosni Mubarak</b> Egyptian president </p> <p><b> King Abdullah </b> of Jordan </p> <p><b> Kofi Annan</b> UN secretary general </p> <p><b> Javier Solana</b> EU foreign policy chief</p>",
  "Hopes of defusing the Middle East crisis suffered a new blow last night when Lebanon's Hizbullah movement claimed to have captured an Israeli intelligence officer - another card to add to three kidnapped soldiers it is already holding. <p>It seemed likely to cast a further shadow over today's Sharm el-Sheikh summit in Egypt, called by President Bill Clinton as a desperate attempt to halt the two-week spiral of violence between Israelis and Palestinians. </p> <p>Reports from Lebanon yesterday named the man as Hanan Tennenbaum, described as an agent of the Mossad secret service. But Israeli officials insisted he was a businessman who had gone missing in Switzerland several days ago. </p> <p>Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, secretary-general of Hizbullah, made the dramatic announcement at a meeting of Muslim leaders in Beirut. </p> <p>In Jerusalem last night, an Israeli minister, Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, a former army chief of staff, hinted that tough action would be taken against both Hizbullah and Lebanon. </p> <p>But he also signalled that Israel might be prepared to negotiate with the radical Shi'ite Muslim organisation. </p> <p>Israeli Radio said that relatives of the businessman, who holds the army reserve rank of colonel, had reported him missing a few days ago after he had left for a trip abroad. </p> <p>Another report said Mr Tennenbaum had been kidnapped by business partners and transferred to Hizbullah. Swiss officials said they were investigating the allegation. </p> <p>\"We are checking information and searching in Switzerland but we cannot confirm that action took place on Swiss territory,\" said Rolf Debrunner, a spokesman for the justice and police ministry. </p> <p>The missing Israeli is understood to have been working for the Israeli electronics and telecommunications company Tadiran. </p> <p>There is evidence that Switzerland is a fertile ground for a covert war between Israel and Islamic extremists. In June, the Swiss supreme court handed down a one year suspended jail sentence on a Mossad agent caught by Swiss police during a surveillance operation on a suspected Hizbullah activist three years ago. Several Islamic militants live in exile in Switzerland. </p> <p>Ephraim Sneh, Israel's deputy minister of defence, confirmed that there was a man of that name, but described him as a private individual. Mr Sneh implied that Israel would be calling on the International Red Cross to take up the case, though it has so far failed to provide any information about the whereabouts of the missing soldiers, seized after a border gun battle earlier this month. </p> <p>The brother of one of the three said yesterday that the family had heard nothing at all from any source. </p> <p>Kofi Annan, the UN secretary-general, has interceded with the Lebanese authorities. On past precedent there is also likely to be a low-profile effort by Germany, exploiting its close relations with Iran, Hizbullah's most powerful patron. </p> <p>A decade ago, quiet UN diplomacy did much to help secure the release of the last of the western hostages held by Iranian-backed groups in Lebanon. </p> <p>Sheikh Nasrallah said further details would be announced \"at the appropriate time\". But his reference to a \"complicated security operation\" appeared to confirm suspicions of a kidnapping or sting operation. </p> <p>Hizbullah has already said it wants to swap the three soldiers for Arab prisoners held in Israel. Israel is still seeking to clarify the fate of an air force navigator, Ron Arad, who was shot down over Lebanon in 1986. </p> <p>In the past Lebanese prisoners held by Israel have been exchanged for the remains of Israeli troops killed in action, in complex and secretive deals brokered by the Red Cross. </p> <p>It is an article of faith that Israel will go to extraordinary lengths to bring its boys home. The Lebanese leader said that the latest kidnapping, like the seizure of the soldiers, was to show support for the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza strip. According to the latest figures, 100 people, mostly Palestinians, have been killed in the clashes. </p> <p>Hizbullah officials meanwhile called on residents of South Lebanon not to approach the border fence for fear of an Israeli attack. </p> <p>Ehud Barak, Israel's prime minister, pulled Israeli forces out of Lebanon last May, fufilling an election pledge made on the grounds that a more effective defence could be mounted from inside the border. Israel had occupied parts of South Lebanon since 1978, when it launched a massive operation against the PLO.</p> <p><b>Prisoners they want to swap</b></p> <p><b> Hizbullah</b> wants Israel to release 15 Lebanese prisoners, including two senior leaders. The Palestinians have asked Hizbullah to include about 1,600 Palestinian prisoners in any swap </p> <p><b> Iran</b> wants four of its nationals believed to have been held by Israel since the 1982 Lebanon war to be included in an exchange </p> <p><b> Israel</b> wants back three of its soldiers, who were captured last week just over the Lebanese border, and presumably also the \"businessman\" whose capture was announced yesterday. It is also seeking information about an air-force navigator, Ron Arad, missing since 1986</p>",
  "Arching steeply over the Danube, the Rainbow bridge is back in use again, at least for pedestrians. Opening it ceremonially to car traffic, 18 months after Nato destroyed its predecessor and the two other bridges in this elegant city, was meant to have been one of the high points of Slobodan Milosevic's election campaign last month. <p>But the work was not finished in time, and the first people to cross the bridge were not grateful citizens thanking their president, but angry protesters who brushed police aside a fortnight ago in one of the many nationwide demonstrations against the Yugoslav leader's election fraud. </p> <p>Instead of being a symbol of Yugoslavia's revival after Nato's air strikes, the bridge represents the tension between Belgrade and Vojvodina, the region of which Novi Sad is the capital. </p> <p>\"The bridge is actually illegal,\" says Radoje Cvetkov, the city's main architect and planner. \"Only three metres wide, each of the two lanes is much too narrow and the angle is too steep. If cars break down or get stuck on ice in the winter, there will be chaos. But, as with most things, Belgrade just went ahead without consulting us.\" </p> <p>European Union leaders confirmed on Saturday that they would provide the money to remove the debris from the other two bridges that still lie in the water in Novi Sad. </p> <p>\"Once the work starts, it will only take between two and three months to provide a wide enough channel for barges and ships to pass. The river has not frozen for the last 20 years, so winter is not a serious factor,\" Mr Cvetkov says. \"To clear the width of the whole river may take another three months\". </p> <p>The closure of the 1,750-mile waterway has had serious effects on Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania, as well as Yugoslavia. Reopening it has been snarled in political arguments. </p> <p>Mr Milosevic insisted that the work be supervised by a Yugoslav (presumably one of his loyalist nominees), while the Danube commission, the long-standing body which represents all the riparian countries, wanted an independent figure who would put the work out to open tender. </p> <p>The EU was willing to give aid for clearing the debris but not - as Mr Milosevic was demanding - aid for rebuilding the bridges, because the latter could be seen as paying reparations for Nato's airstrikes. In either case, no money was to be paid while Mr Milosevic wasstill president. </p> <p>Now he has fallen and the money will flow. Mr Cvetkov is confident that help will also come for rebuilding the main suspension bridge, which sags spectacularly into the water. </p> <p>\"I think it's realistic to expect help,\" he says. \"After all, Nato always said it was bombing Milosevic, not the Serbian people.\" </p> <p>With money due to flow from Brussels, and probably Washington too, the main issue now for the post-Milosevic leaders in Novi Sad is how to get more money from Belgrade. The 18-party alliance in power there now, Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS), which organised Vojislav Kostunica's election victory last month, swept the board in the regional assembly elections in Vojvodina last week, taking 117 of the 120 seats. </p> <p>\"Kostunica is not a solution for the Vojvodina. He was our standard-bearer in the fight against Milosevic, but he won't do anything for us. Our real struggle is only starting now,\" says the local DOS leader, Nenad Canak, who is chairman of the League of Social-Democrats of Vojvodina. </p> <p>A towering figure, who looks more rather than less formidable as he stumbles round his office on giant crutches after crashing his motorbike, Mr Canak is known as one of the most outspoken men in Serbian politics. </p> <p>\"The thing they call Yugoslavia is a fraud. Yugoslavia doesn't exist. The Yugoslav army is just an occupying force in Montenegro,\" he said. </p> <p>Leaving Montenegro aside, he favours a decentralised but federal Serbia with substantial autonomy for five regions plus Belgrade and a new contract for sharing the powers that would be left to the federal centre. </p> <p>While he favours Vojvodina becoming a republic within Serbia - some in Novi Sad want full independence - he knows that even getting real autonomy will take time. For all his fiery rhetoric, Mr Canak is a realist. </p> <p>\"People supported us as a weapon against Milosevic, not as a vote for autonomy or a republic. I won't force any autonomy changes through. First you need to build up public support,\" he said. </p> <p>Vojvodina used to be the jewel of the Yugoslav economy. It had all the oil refineries and the petrochemical industry, as well as flourishing wheat, corn, and sunflower fields. </p> <p>\"When Milosevic centralised everything under Belgrade's control, he took our resources and our money. Some 42% of Serbia's budget revenue came from here. Now we have to start getting it back and filling our institutions with real power,\" Mr Canak explained. </p> <p>\"The stereotype of Vojvodina is that we are slow and peaceful. It is wrong. This was always a military border area, so we are descendants of soldiers and are very tough. But we have learned that tolerance is the cheapest way of existence.\" </p> <p>In the streets of Novi Sad ordinary people seem to agree: \"Independence is unnecessary and expensive. We will be part of Europe now anyway. That's what matters,\" commented Tibor Wajda, 55, a Hungarian-speaking theatre director. </p> <p>\"For political reasons we can't get more autonomy. We need economic autonomy from Belgrade. That's all,\" said Dragan Vujanovic, who worked as a sound engineer for state TV for 10 years. \"Everyone wanted to get out of Milosevic's Yugoslavia, not secede from the Serbian people.\"</p>",
  "The Belarussian president, Alexander Lukashenko, was confident of victory yesterday in a general election which has been dismissed by his opponents as a farce, boycotted by most of the opposition and which is unlikely to be recognised by the west. <p>Speculation that the suppressed opposition movement would take inspiration from events in Belgrade appeared unfounded. In the run-up to the election, the president instructed his security forces to ensure that a \"Yugoslav variant\" did not occur.</p> <p>But even before the count, human rights groups said the poll was neither free nor fair.</p> <p>Of the 565 candidates running for 110 seats in the lower chamber, only 54 were not firm Lukashenko supporters.</p> <p>Some opposition candidates were barred from running on registration technicalities; while others chose to boycott the poll altogether, arguing that the election - like the regime - was not legitimate because it was based on Mr Lukashenko's unconstitutional dissolution of an earlier, opposition-led chamber in 1996, when the president also extended his powers radically through a referendum of dubious legitimacy.</p> <p>The few anti-Lukashenko candidates who did run were denied the chance to campaign, their message stifled by the regime's continuing crackdown on the press.</p> <p>Mr Lukashenko, a former chicken farmer, dismissed the opposition as a \"handful of windbags\" funded by the west.</p> <p>His firm suppression of the opposition movement has kept it small and those who are active risk severe retribution. Over the past two years, a string of key opposition figures have died, been imprisoned or vanished without trace.</p> <p>The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which acts as an election watchdog, did not send its observers to the vote yesterday, after the Belarus government failed to follow its guidelines by providing the opposition equal access to television and radio, and allowing it to participate in electoral commissions.</p> <p>The former prime minister, Mikhail Chigir, an opposition leader who decided to break the boycott to launch a bid for power in next year's presidential elections, said Mr Lukashenko could not have won if the opposition had enjoyed access to television. Polls forecast that parties loyal to Mr Lukashenko would win about 60% of the seats.</p> <p>Despite the depressed economy in this former Soviet republic, the president who plays on nostalgia for the old Soviet era, is supported by many of the rural poor. He has also developed his own leadership cult - many people call him batka (father), just as they once called Josef Stalin father.</p> <p>Deprived of support from the west, Mr Lukashenko has built friendly ties with Russia, China, Iran, Iraq and Libya.</p>",
  "A three-year-old boy who went missing at a remote beauty spot had spent the night huddled under a bush, his rescuers said yesterday. <p>Cameron Munro was found safe and well by a rescue dog and his handler after being missing for 16 hours. He had disappeared at the Highland beauty spot the Falls of Shin, near Dornoch, Sutherland at around 4.30pm on Saturday and was found yesterday about half a mile away. </p> <p>Flight Sergeant Al Sylvester, from RAF Kinloss, one of 34 RAF rescuers who had spent the night searching for the boy, said: \"He was perfectly fine. He wasn't hurt or upset at all. He was talking to himself about dinosaurs and he had been looking for dinosaurs in the woods when he went missing. He had only been out of his mother's sight for seconds.\" </p> <p>Mr Sylvester added: \"When he was found he was a little cold, he must have slept through the night. He was quite sheltered but it is still incredible he survived. </p> <p>\"He lives in a farm area and he must be a hardened wee boy with a real will to live.\" </p> <p>Cameron, from Ardgay, was reported missing from a play area at the Falls of Shin visitor centre by his mother who was also with his two-year-old sister. </p> <p>A full-scale search was mounted with three mountain rescue teams, helicopters fitted with heat-seeking equipment from the coastguard and RAF Kinloss, police officers, sniffer dogs and scores of volunteers. </p> <p>Mountain rescue teams continued the hunt overnight and a full-scale search resumed at first light. </p> <p>Mr Sylvester said a dog found Cameron sitting in the undergrowth yesterday morning. \"The feeling is just fantastic but we were convinced that we were going to find him alive.\" </p> <p>Cameron was released from Raigmore Hospital in Inverness after a check-up.</p>"
