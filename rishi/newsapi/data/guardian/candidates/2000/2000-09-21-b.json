  "President Alberto Fujimori's surprise announcement last weekend that he would step down and call fresh elections followed signs that he was losing the support of the powerful military in the fallout from two major corruption scandals involving Peru's notorious intelligence service. <p>Mr Fujimori's decision, announced in a national address, stunned the country and left Peru's opposition scrambling to build a united front. Officials said the election was likely to be held within six months, and Vice-President Francisco Tudela said that Mr Fujimori \"has the full intention of staying in power during that time\". For their part, opposition leaders demanded that Mr Fujimori step down immediately in favour of a transition government. </p> <p>Last Saturday's announcement was a breathtaking reversal for Mr Fujimori, Latin America's longest-serving elected leader, who had weathered severe criticism since winning an unprecedented third five-year term in May elections widely described as unfair. </p> <p>International pressure had been mounting on him to agree to democratic reforms, including firing Vladimiro Montesinos, the architect of Peru's ruthless intelligence service, who has been Mr Fujimori's most important aide since his rise from obscure academic to president in 1990. </p> <p>Demands to deal decisively with Mr Montesinos reached a climax after a videotape was made public last week showing the intelligence chief handing a $15,000 bribe to an opposition congressman to back Mr Fujimori. </p> <p>With pressure growing on Mr Fujimori to act, several key regional leaders of Peru's military refused to attend a meeting called by the president last Saturday to gauge his support within the armed forces, but it was unclear whether the military chiefs withdrew their support for Mr Fujimori out of loyalty to Mr Montesinos or in an effort to hasten his, and Mr Fujimori's, departure. </p> <p>In a sign that elements of the military were opposed to Mr Montesinos, Fernando Olivera - head of the opposition Independent Moralising Front - who obtained the damaging videotape, said that it had \"come from a civilian source with links to a discontented segment of the military\". </p> <p>Mr Olivera said he has obtained other tapes from intelligence sources that show footage of Mr Montesinos bribing businessmen, journalists, politicians and even some military officers to support Mr Fujimori. </p> <p>On Tuesday Mr Montesinos was reported to be holed up at a Peruvian military base as opposition politicians demanded his arrest. </p> <p>\"The military obviously played a key role,\" said Francisco Loayza, an intelligence adviser to Mr Fujimori in the early days of his first administration. \"As far as I can tell... they began withdrawing support as the scandal around Mr Montesinos grew. Mr Fujimori saw what he built begin to come apart, and decided it was not possible to continue governing.\" </p> <p>In his address Mr Fujimori said that he was dismantling the National Intelligence Service. The organisation had been instrumental in destroying the leadership of two leftist guerrilla groups during the early 1990s - by means that human rights groups said included torture, executions, and intimidation and persecution of many innocent Peruvians. </p> <p>Mr Fujimori's announcement set off spontaneous celebrations across Peru, including in the capital's main plaza opposite the presidential palace, where flag-waving revelers converged. </p> <p>Mr Fujimori's decision was hailed by the United States, which has had an uneasy relationship with the president, supporting his hard line on drug traffickers, but opposing his moves against democracy. </p> <p>A White House statement said: \"We welcome the bold step taken by President Fujimori. The actions announced... are clearly aimed at resolving the political polarisation facing Peru [and]... represent a good beginning to such an endeavour.\" </p> <p>Mr Fujimori's decision was an unexpected windfall for Alejandro Toledo, who pulled out of the second round of balloting for the presidency in May. He said he still does not believe Mr Fujimori will give up power so easily, but he called the decision \"a great step toward democracy for Peru\". </p> <p>Mr Toledo also officially declared his candidacy to succeed Mr Fujimori. \"I plan to be president; I am ready to be president; I will be president,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>The Bill's storylines rarely win plaudits for authenticity, but the ITV cop show appears to be so realistic that a man whose wrongful arrest left him too traumatised to watch it won \u00a37,750 damages yesterday. </p> <p>Paul Stevenson, who was arrested during a post-match fight at a pub frequented by football hooligans, was yesterday awarded \u00a35,000 for false imprisonment and \u00a32,750 aggravated damages. He claimed that the ordeal was so bad that anything involving the police brought back terrifying memories. </p> <p>\"Even when I switch on The Bill on telly it brings it all back,\" he told a judge at Nottingham county court. </p> <p>Mr Stevenson, 31, was cleared of all charges. He claimed that he was hit with a baton and twice bitten by a police dog during the incident, after an England match during the Euro 96 tournament. </p> <p>He admitted watching the match at the Ruby Tuesday's bar in Nottingham, which police described in court as a well-known meeting place for hooligans. But he insisted that he was only among the crowd during the violence because he had become separated from his girlfriend and was trying to find her. </p> <p>Although his attempt to win damages for malicious prosecution was thrown out, a jury upheld his claims for injuries and false imprisonment. </p> <p>Judge Oliver James said: \"Mr Stevenson brought this case as a citizen who had never been in trouble with the police before. He came here to clear his name, and he has succeeded. Citizens being wrongly arrested is quite wrong, and damages should be awarded for it.\" </p> <p>Mr Stevenson, a father of two, said outside the court: \"This is a vindication of what I said had happened. I am obviously delighted. I was totally innocent, but it could happen to anyone. I just hope the police will step back and think what they are doing before they jump in feet-first.\" </p> <p>A police spokesman said last night: \"The jury found that the officers had not fabricated their accounts of the incident. The judge said it was apparent from the jury's findings that the officers had been mistaken, but that they had not been dishonest.\" </p> <p>An ITV source said: \"This case shows how realistic and dramatic The Bill's storylines are. Millions of viewers watch it, and we hope Mr Stevenson recovers enough to be able to come back to Britain's favourite police show.\"</p>",
  "In pursuit of its 10-year-old war of attrition with Saddam Hussein's Iraq, the US maintains a force in the Gulf numbering 20,000 soldiers, sailors and airmen, 200 aircraft and 25 ships. About 3,000 ground combat troops are permanently deployed on Kuwait's northern border, backed by heavy weapons and Patriot missiles. US and British warplanes meanwhile ceaselessly patrol the no-fly zones. Briefing the senate armed services committee in Washington this week, Walter Slocombe, under-secretary of defence for policy, noted that military preparedness was just part of the costly US effort: the Clinton-Gore administration was using \"the full range of tactics\", including economic sanctions, diplomacy, intelligence-gathering and support for anti-regime groups. This was the policy of containment. And it was well worth it, argued Edward Walker, an assistant secretary of state. Iraq remained \"dangerous, unreconstructed and defiant\" and would pose a threat to regional security as long as Saddam held sway. <p>It fell to senator Edward Kennedy to ask the obvious question: \"Who's got who in a box here?\" And it is not difficult to supply the answer. Nine years after Operation Desert Storm, the rules of the game have changed but official Washington seems not to have noticed. These days Saddam does not even make a pretence of cooperating with the UN, refusing to allow its weapons inspectors to return while finding ever more ways, with growing Russian and regional connivance, to circumvent sanctions. Baghdad no longer angles for a gradual, negotiated end to its international ostracism. On the contrary, it rejects outright the security council's latest resolution, confident that big hitters like France and China would rather see an end to the whole sorry saga. Sensing the west's weakness, exacerbated by US electoral distractions, Saddam uses this moment to renew his threats, explicit and implicit, against Kuwait and Saudi Arabia in mocking defiance of all that sophisticated American firepower. </p> <p>But it is a far cruder weapon that may now furnish Saddam with the killer punch he needs to break out of \"containment\": oil. Put simply, he has it, lots of it, and the US and the west need it, more than ever. Kuwaiti oil started the Gulf war; Iraqi oil may finally finish it. As the spot price spirals, Saddam is no longer playing for advantage; he is playing to win. So who is in the box now, Walter?</p>",
  "The Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, flew to an army base in Montenegro yesterday to denounce his opponents as \"rabbits, rats and even hyenas\" and warn the west not to interfere in elections on Sunday, which the opinion polls indicate that he cannot win. <p>Scores of Mr Milosevic's critics have been detained and with tension rising the chief opposition candidate, Vojislav Kostunica, has warned that the president could use fraud to stay in power. Western governments fear he will use the army to crush protests if he is declared the winner. A US aircraft carrier is being sent to the Adriatic. </p> <p>It was Mr Milosevic's first visit to Montenegro - which with Serbia makes up Yugoslavia - since he became federal president three years ago. His helicopter brought him to the rally near the town of Berane, within 15 miles of Kosovo, where Nato-led troops could have arrested him on war crimes charges brought by the Hague tribunal last year. </p> <p>The republic of Montenegro is deeply divided and its pro-western government, led by Milo Djukanovic, is boycotting the Yugoslav election. A former Serbian information minister, Aleksandar Tijanic, warned that Mr Milosevic was preparing to arrest the Montenegrin president. </p> <p>Mr Djukanovic said last night that Montenegro would defend itself if Mr Milosevic provoked a military clash. Speaking to Russian television, he said: \"If Milosevic decides to provoke a military conflict with Montenegro, we would have no choice but to defend our freedom.\" </p> <p>A US navy spokeswoman confirmed yesterday that the aircraft carrier George Washington would arrive in the Adriatic from the Persian Gulf on about September 30. \"This is much the normal tour of duty,\" the spokeswoman said. \"There hasn't been a carrier in the Adriatic for about three or four months and the George Washington is on its way back to the Atlantic.\" </p> <p>Mr Milosevic yesterday told a crowd of 10,000 supporters bussed in from nearby towns: \"Our country is the focus of much attention from the world's strongest nations, as if mankind has no other worries but how ... Serbs and Montenegrins will govern their joint state.\" Many in the crowd shouted \"Slobo, Slobo\" and \"We are all Yugoslavia\". </p> <p>He has clamped down on the independent media and ordered police to confiscate computers and other material from Serbian election monitoring groups. Under the law, independent observers have no right to enter polling stations or attend the count. </p> <p>Despite the pressures, the opposition has done remarkably well by uniting behind Mr Kostunica, a Belgrade lawyer, Only the maverick Serbian Renewal Movement is running a separate candidate. An opinion poll by the Belgrade-based Strategic Marketing agency gave Mr Kostunica 32.5% of the vote to Mr Milosevic's 26.6%. The Centre for Policy Studies gave Mr Kostunica 41% to Mr Milosevic's 20%. </p> <p>Mr Milosevic has support in rural areas and has manipulated the campaign through control of state television. State controls on the price of staple goods have also cushioned the realities of a weak economy. But years of war and corruption at the top have disillusioned many urban voters. </p> <p>Warning of vote rigging, Mr Kostunica told a rally at the weekend: \"They are bullies, liars and thieves and have stolen years of our lives and dignity. Now they are preparing to steal the elections\". </p> <p>Mr Milosevic could cheat by falsifying votes from Kosovo. The UN has allowed the poll to go ahead there but will not be running or supervising it. In the last Serbian presidential elections as many as 200,000 Albanians supposedly voted for Mr Milosevic's right-hand man. Because of the boycott in Montenegro, Mr Milosevic can also steal votes which are cast in army camps and town halls run by the pro-Belgrade party. </p> <p>The EU has offered to lift sanctions if the election \"leads to democratic change\". The wording was chosen with care as the Yugoslav constitution is so ambiguous it could allow Mr Milosevic to serve out his term until next July, even if the opposition wins. But most observers believe he is more likely simply to declare victory and hope to ride out - or shoot out - any protests.</p>",
  "Hillary Clinton dodged a cloud lingering over her campaign for a seat in the senate yesterday when the six-year Whitewater real estate investigation found insufficient evidence for criminal charges against her or the president. <p>But Robert Ray, the independent counsel whose inquiry cost a record $52m, stopped well short of saying there was nothing to the allegations. \"This office has determined that the evidence was insufficient to prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that either president or Mrs Clinton knowingly participated in criminal conduct or had any knowledge of criminal conduct,\" he said. </p> <p>Mrs Clinton said: \"I am confident that not only have New Yorkers and Americans made up their minds, but there's nothing to the report.\" </p> <p>Mr Ray's work was submitted to a panel of three judges and its contents will not be known in full for at least three months, well after election day in November. </p> <p>A White House spokesman said: \"Robert Ray is now the latest investigator to complete an examination into the transactions related to the Whitewater Development Co and conclude that there are no grounds for legal action.\" </p> <p>While the main part of Mr Ray's investigation is now over, he is still considering whether to bring criminal charges against President Clinton in connection with the Monica Lewinsky affair. A grand jury has been empanelled in Washington and no decision will be made until after Mr Clinton has left office. </p> <p>Fourteen other people were convicted in the course of the inquiry into the Clintons' failed real estate operations in Whitewater in 1978, including their friend Webster Hubbell and a former governor of Arkansas, Jim Guy Tucker. </p> <p>Mrs Clinton's role, including the question of whether she helped to make documents disappear, was at the centre of Mr Ray's endeavours. Whitewater was to have been a holiday complex dominated by time-share units but the deal collapsed when a local bank owned by the Clintons' part ners, James and Susan McDougal, failed. </p> <p>The investigation into possible criminal conduct by the Clintons and McDougals began in 1994 when the attorney general, Janet Reno, appointed Kenneth Starr, Mr Ray's predecessor, to look into whether the partnership broke the law as it tried to keep the project alive. </p> <p>Mr Clinton, clearly suspi cious of the timing of the Ray report's findings seven weeks before his wife's date with the electorate, said: \"I think people can draw their own conclusions about that. I think it's pretty obvious.\" </p> <p>It was not until recently that Mrs Clinton opened up a lead over her Republican opponent, the previously obscure Long Island congressman Rick Lazio.</p>"
