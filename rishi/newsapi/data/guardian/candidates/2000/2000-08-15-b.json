  "In American Rhapsody, his excellent new book on the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, the writer Joe Eszterhas makes the case that Bill Clinton is not just the first rock 'n' roll US president, he is also the Mick Jagger of politics. <p>So it was wholly appropriate that last night, in the Staples Centre in Los Angeles, Bill Clinton's managers lifted, without apology, a gimmick from the most recent Rolling Stones tour. As the stage darkened and the audience sensed that the star's entrance was near, a video clicked on, modelled precisely on the one the Stones used to orchestrate their own entrance a year or so ago.</p> <p> Down an extravagantly long hallway came the ageing legend, slowly walking nearer and nearer to the camera. Then, as the music grew louder and the cheering less restrained, the iconic figure almost seamlessly moved out of the video and on to the stage, a shamelessly theatrical entrance. The audience loved it. Jumping Bill Flash was back. </p> <p>But Clinton is not only a rock star. He is also the central character in a political soap opera that has held America spellbound for almost eight years. At the end of the last series, Bill and Hillary and daughter Chelsea almost split apart. The defining shot of the final episode was of the strained, stiff, don't-be-fooled image of the three central characters walking across the White House lawn hand in hand, jaws set. Would they survive? Most thought not, but only time would tell. </p> <p>Well, as in all durable soaps, the Clintons of course survived. And last night was the counterpoint to those grim endings in 1998, before Monica Lewinsky was written out of the script. As Clinton finished his speech, he was joined on stage by Hillary and Chelsea yet again. This time the strain was gone. It was all hugs and kisses and smiles. As another curtain falls, the Clintons will all live happily ever after - or maybe not. </p> <p>Last night was Clinton's bid to be taken seriously. His speech to the first night of the Democratic convention was a plea to his detractors that his presidency was not, like Seinfeld, a show about nothing. On the contrary. </p> <p>Clinton pitched his claims high. He was the figurehead of \"the New Democratic agenda that has taken our country to new heights of prosperity, progress and peace.\" He clearly felt he had nothing to apologise for, and this time he apologised for nothing. In the hall, hundreds of delegates deliriously waved placards bearing an unequivocal tribute to this most ambiguous of politicians: \"Thank you, President Clinton\". </p> <p>If you are one of those who simply cannot take Clinton seriously, this farewell speech was simply hot air on a torrid southern California evening. But if instead you are one of those who sees Clinton at least in part as he sees himself, as a politician who is engaged in a historic task of redefining and re-applying the progressive legacy of the twentieth century, then this valedictory speech was an irresistible mix of high seriousness and questionable aesthetics. </p> <p>Clinton's speech made huge claims. Some of them were laundry list claims - inflation down, jobs up, crime down, educational achievement up, and a lot more. Some list. </p> <p>Others were vintage rhetorical Clinton. \"The stars have never shone more brightly on any people at any time\". America was \"more hopeful, more secure, more free\" than at any time in its history. It was closer than ever to \"the America of our dreams.\" For a man who is bowing out, it was extraordinarily confident stuff. </p> <p>There were all the references to Al Gore than any Gore lieutenant could possibly have demanded, but you could not miss the fact that here was a master politician quitting at the top of his game. If he was allowed to stand for more than two terms, he would unquestionably be doing so, and all Al Gore's excellent qualities would be as nothing. And if he were standing, Clinton would, of course, be re-elected. </p> <p>He ended as he began eight years ago, quoting the Fleetwood Mac number that became his theme song in the 1992 election. \"Don't stop thinking about tomorrow.\" He is an impossibly tough act to follow, and Gore has an unenviable task on Thursday when arrives to claim the crown. </p> <p>By then, Clinton will be far away. As Los Angeles awakes this morning, Clinton is already far away en route to Michigan and the symbolic handover to Gore. The great speech was yesterday, and as the next line of the Fleetwood Mac song says, yesterday's gone. </p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.dems2000.com/PressRoom/00_speechtranscripts.html\">Democrat convention 2000 speech transcripts</a></p>",
  "Bill Clinton was set to make one last bravura appearance in front of the adoring Democratic faithful last night, opening the party convention in Los Angeles, before slipping quietly out of town and leaving Al Gore to see what he can make out of his mixed legacy. <p>It was the climax of a long weekend in Los Angeles during which Mr Clinton and his wife Hillary have rarely been out of the spotlight, before leaving Mr Gore to put his own stamp on the Democratic party when he arrives in Los Angeles tomorrow. </p> <p>Before then the president will symbolically pass the torch to his deputy at a campaign event in Michigan, after which, the Gore campaign desperately hopes, Mr Clinton will conquer his instincts and fade into the background. </p> <p>The president was expected to mount a trenchant defence of his eight-year administration last night, arguing that it was absurd for the Republican presidential candidate, George W Bush to say that he and Mr Gore deserved no credit for America's soaring economy and greater social peace. </p> <p>America's sustained growth, budgetary surpluses and record home ownership would be at risk under anyone other than Mr Gore, he was expected to say. </p> <p>The speech was not expected to mention the Monica Lewinsky affair or the impeachment crisis which followed it. </p> <p>Aides did not expect him to offer another apology for his behaviour, since any mention of the scandal would snatch the headlines away from a speech designed to set out what he hopes will be his more lasting political legacy. </p> <p>In preparation for the valedictory address, aides said, he had been studying the much-admired way in which Ronald Reagan choreographed the similar moment in his own career, when he passed the baton to George Bush at the Republican convention in New Orleans in 1988. </p> <p>While Mr Reagan was widely applauded for the way he quickly left the stage, many critics have asked this week whether Mr Clinton can bring himself ever to do so. </p> <p>Mrs Clinton was also due to address the convention last night, becoming the only presidential spouse since her idol Eleanor Roosevelt to speak at three successive Democratic conventions. </p> <p>Earlier yesterday Mr Clinton rounded off an intensive three days of fundraising with a series of meetings with some of the Democratic party's core supporters, including blacks, Latinos and trade unions. </p> <p>He told reporters that he was confident that Mr Gore could overtake Mr Bush's persistent poll lead, but said it would take hard work to energise the electorate in a prosperous era, without the major divisions or crises of the past. </p> <p>\"We can turn around these polls, but it's not the work of a day. It's going to take every day between now and November,\" he told a brunch in honour of his cabinet. </p> <p>\"You've got to go out of this convention committed to telling people this is a big election, there are big differences, in spite of all the good that's been done in the last eight years you haven't seen anything yet.\" </p> <p>Everything Mr Clinton said and did in Los Angeles reflected the bitter-sweet character of these final months of his presidency. On the one hand, he wants to draw attention to his achievements by any and every means possible. On the other, he is aware that the more he appears to hog the limelight, the more difficult he is making Mr Gore's task. </p> <p>As he toured a succession of star-studded fundraising functions at the weekend, he showed yet again how much he is being pulled in opposite directions. </p> <p>\"How quickly it all passed, and what an absolute joy it was,\" he told a gathering in his honour on Saturday night. </p> <p>\"For me this was not only the greatest honour of my life but every day, even the bad days, were good days.\" </p> <p>Interviewed by the Los Angeles Times yesterday, he once again stressed his desire to surrender the leading role to Mr Gore while simultaneously demonstrating a characteristically obsessive interest in all aspects of the campaign to succeed him. </p> <p>And he could not restrain himself from looking forward to playing a back-seat driver's role in a Gore administration. </p> <p>\"I told Al once that if he got elected president, my main goal would be to stay out of his way, because America can only afford one president at a time,\" he said. </p> <p>\"But if he wanted to talk to me, I'd be glad to talk to him.\"</p>",
  "Gore won a standing ovation as the Democratic convention kicked off by telling a delighted audience that the United States had become \"the greatest terrorist and the largest rogue state\" in the world. He was also applauded loudly after announcing that today \"only corporate America enjoys representation\". <p>This was Gore Vidal, it should be said, former Democratic politician, novelist, playwright, historian, mischief-maker and cousin of young Al. He was addressing a full house at the Leo Baeck temple just opposite that symbol of corporate authority, the Getty Centre, as the delegates assembled for the first day of the convention. </p> <p>Vidal lamented that \"50 years ago I used to be the only Gore\" and used his presentation to a \"town hall\" meeting organised by the magazine the Nation to urge whoever was the next president to use his entire first term of office to \"tame the American military\". He attacked the Pentagon as a major reason for the collapse of the democratic system in the United States and for the waste of public money. </p> <p>\"Congress has been hijacked by corporate America and its enforcers,\" Vidal said. \"Our empire is now the greatest terrorist of all.\" </p> <p>He said that since the Soviet Union \"unsportingly disbanded\", the world's 1bn Muslims have been demonised as wild fanatics in order to justify the continuation of military spending. </p> <p>Since 1946, he said, $7.1 trillion had been spent on defence while national debts totalled $3.6 trillion. </p> <p>Vidal also attacked the American drug laws saying that \"we started the damn country\" to get away from such restrictions and suggested that the founding fathers had included many laudanum addicts. \"Anything taken for joy is against God's will,\" had become the justification for the drugs laws, he said. </p> <p>People had forgotten the effects of prohibition, he said: \"We have become the United States of Amnesia.\" He accused the US of \"swaggering round the world smashing countries like Colombia\" and finished his address to a standing ovation and cries of \"run, Gore, run!\" from the audience. </p> <p>Tom Hayden, now a Californian senator but arrested at the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago during the anti-war demonstrations, voiced his support for the thousands who have already taken to the streets of Los Angeles in some of the rolling demonstrations taking place during the week. </p> <p>\"The Democratic party should not try and stigmatise the people who raised hell in Seattle and gave birth to a new generation of radicalism,\" said Mr Hayden. </p> <p>\"More and more people are feeling that there is no other way than to get out on the streets. It is a great blessing instead of a danger to the city of Los Angeles. Everyone in this room was someone real and vibrant before they became middle-aged.\" </p> <p>Jesse Jackson Jr, 35, congressman and delegate at the convention, said that people now believed that they had a right to a gun but not a right to a proper education. A few miles away his father addressed a rally outside Loews hotel in Santa Monica to call for union rights for the hotel workers there. </p> <p>The gatherings were just two of dozens due to be held this week by those who suggest that the real issues are not being addressed by the convention. The first of the major demonstrations, in support of the journalist and former Black Panther Mumia Abu-Jamal who has been on death row in Pennsylvania since 1981, took place on Sunday as did a large picket of Gap. There were protests yesterday to support abortion rights and highlight \"corporate shame\".</p>",
  "Children under the age of 14 are working on the ranch of the Mexican president-elect, Vicente Fox, sowing onions and potatoes in contravention of laws banning child labour, a newspaper reported at the weekend. <p>The Mexico City daily Reforma said on Saturday that it had found at least 30 minors and teenagers being taken by truck into the Fox family ranch, San Cristobal, in the central state of Guanajuato, to work in the fields for about 65 pesos (about \u00a34) a day. </p> <p>The Mexican constitution bans children younger than 14 from working. Children between 14 and 16 are only allowed to work six hours a day, and the country recently ratified an International Labour Organisation convention against some of the worst forms of abuse of children as workers. </p> <p>Nevertheless, child labour, especially in the impoverished countryside, is common. </p> <p>Mr Fox, who recently returned from a tour of South America in his first foreign trip before taking office on December 1, spent the weekend at the ranch. His aides could not be reached for comment. </p> <p>Reforma said that among the more than 30 youngsters picked up at 5.30am on Saturday were 12-year-old Jose, 13-year-old Juan and 11-year-old Sanjuana. </p> <p>It said the children showed its reporter their 390-peso (\u00a328) weekly paycheck. Reforma said that since the children were hired as seasonal workers, they received no other benefits. </p> <p>Many of the children had left school to help earn money for their families. They worked from 7am to around 4pm, taking an hour lunch break. </p> <p>A young man who appeared to be taking care of them, Mario, aged 20, complained about the hard work and low pay. \"It barely pays for food and they don't pay you for every day you work,\" Mario said. </p> <p>On July 2 Mr Fox broke the Institutional Revolutional party's 71-year grip on the presidency. Running for the conservative National Action party, he promised to battle against corruption and a widespread disregard for the law.</p>",
  "Carol Johnson, who has died aged 97, was a long-serving general secretary of the Parliamentary Labour party, from 1943-59, who then inherited the safe Lewisham South seat from his political master, Herbert Morrison, and was its MP from 1959 until 1974. <p>During Labour's years in power - as part of the wartime coalition government, and after its 1945 election victory - he was the instrument of rightwing party disciplinarians like chief whip William Whitely and Morrison himself, then lord president of the council. Their main aim, in which Johnson was the intermediary, was to curb the left, particularly the supporters of Aneurin Bevan, such as Richard Crossman. </p> <p>Plump, with a bald head and fixed half-smile, Johnson resembled a china egg on which an upturned half-moon had been stencilled. His high-pitched, whining voice prevented his becoming an effective political speaker. He had earlier served as leader of Lambeth borough council and, during the early years of the war, as assistant town clerk of Southall. </p> <p>He was rewarded for his loyalty in 1959, when Morrison, having been worsted by Hugh Gaitskell for Labour's leadership, became a life peer, and managed to get his old constituency to pick Johnson as his successor. On being elected, Johnson contrasted \"pragmatists\" - such as himself - with leftwing \"fundamentalists\", who defied the electorate. </p> <p>Given his disciplinarian past, it was curious that, as an MP, he then became something of a rebel. In 1965, he wrote a report urging links between the six countries of the EEC and the Western European Union. He became secretary to the British Council of the European Movement and vice president of the Labour Committee for Europe. In 1974, he chastised the Economist for its \"partisan\" reporting of the Arab-Israeli war, and attacked Israeli intransigence in a letter to the Guardian. </p> <p>Such views, his age (then 70), plus his low profile in the Commons, where he preferred to serve as chairman of committees, did not make his survival likely when local constituency boundaries were redrawn before the February 1974 general election; nor did his running war with his neighbour, James Dickens, the leftwing MP for Lewisham West. So he withdrew from the contest and retired to East Sussex. </p> <p>Even so, Johnson's career had been a high climb for someone from a modest London family, who attended only local council schools. He became a solicitor in 1933, often serving as poor man's lawyer and adviser to housing associations. He is survived by his wife of 60 years, Edna. </p> <p>\u0095 Carol Alfred Johnson, politician, born 1903; died July 30 2000</p>",
  "Jaap Marais, who has died aged 77, was an anglophobe diehard who led the Herstigte National party (HNP) in South Africa, which continued to fight for \"pure\" apartheid even after mainstream Afrikaner nationalism had begun to compromise. <p>The HNP (its title herstigte means reconstituted) attracted a powerful minority in the paranoid world of Afrikaner politics after the assassination in 1966 of Hendrik Verwoerd, the ideologist of apartheid. But the first-past-the-post system in the all-white elections of the old regime (aided by dirty tricks) saw to it that the HNP never won a poll. </p> <p>The splinter party was formed in 1969 after its three original leaders, all South African MPs, were expelled from the mainstream National party (NP). They were Albert Hertzog, a political lightweight and son of General JDM Hertzog, the creator of the NP and a prewar prime minister, Louis Stofberg and Marais, who was always the group's principal driving force and propagandist. </p> <p>It is hard to imagine a political grouping to the right of the NP, certainly as it was under John Vorster, the hardline former justice minister chosen to succeed Verwoerd. But even Vorster found it necessary to try for an accommodation with South Africa's independent black neighbours as apartheid became an increasing economic and diplomatic liability. In 1970, for example, he held secret talks with President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia; later, he persuaded President Hastings Banda, of Malawi, to open diplomatic relations in exchange for financial aid. </p> <p>These small steps were too much for diehards like Marais and his colleagues. They accused Vorster of being a closet liberal, a grotesque allegation which nevertheless unleashed charges and counter-charges of treason amid a new epidemic of broedertwis (brotherly hate), a staple of Afrikaner politics. Aware that the NP had come to power in 1948 by overtaking the United Party (UP) on the right, an alarmed NP launched a vicious campaign of vilification against the three rebels, who were subsequently ousted in the all-white election of 1970. </p> <p>Marais showed considerable courage in his initial role as deputy leader and principal ideological driving force of the fledgling HNP. He resembled the Nazi leader Joseph Goebbels not only in his rhetoric, and his surprising intellectual and cultural strengths (and personal charm when he chose), but also in his physical disability; both his feet were painfully deformed. </p> <p>When I interviewed Marais for my then employers, the Times, I was treated with elaborate courtesy by my subject, but as a blatant subversive by the NP and the Afrikaans press, which took up the vilification of the HNP with gusto. One paper observed that the Times was \"a traditional enemy of the Afrikaner volk\", and Marais was pilloried in unsubtle cartoons for dealing with \"the English.\" </p> <p>This, too, was a wild distortion for Marais, who succeeded Hertzog as party leader in 1977, as the HNP struggled on in the twilight of apartheid. To the end, he never forgave the British for the Boer war, during which both his politically-active parents were interned. </p> <p>Born in Vryburg, in the northern Cape province, Jaap Marais was one of eight children raised on the family farm. After a basic rural education, he joined the NP youth movement and studied in his spare time for a degree at Pretoria University. He won a seat in the Cape Town parliament at a byelection in the Transvaal in 1958. He remained a backbencher, but worked hard in committees and, now and again, delivered a great diatribe against the liberalism and communism he believed was sweeping the country. </p> <p>Away from the bear-pit of Afrikaner politics, he took pride in his command of the language and verse of the hated English, and even translated some Shakespeare into Afrikaans, a coarse tongue surprisingly amenable to poetry. His other gentle interests included the fine wines of South Africa and breeding prizewinning budgerigars. </p> <p>He clung to his racist beliefs to the last, even after the ultra-rightist standard had been snatched away by Andries Treurnicht in the 1980s, Nelson Mandela had been released in 1990 and the African National Congress had won power in South Africa's first election under universal suffrage in 1994. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Maria, a son and a daughter. </p> <p>\u0095 Jacob Albertus 'Jaap' Marais, politician, born November 2 1922; died August 8 2000</p>"
