  "<p>I've spent the week interviewing Reynolds Price and investigating his literary papers. Price, born in 1933, was one of that golden generation of American novelists (Gore Vidal, William Styron and Truman Capote are others) who seemed to have been blessed in the cradle with genius, physical grace and - what writers need above all - good luck at the outset of their careers. </p> <p>A Rhodes scholar at Oxford in 1956, Price sent a batch of his unpublished stories to Stephen Spender (then the editor of the magazine Encounter) on the whimsical grounds that he thought the great poet had \"the kindest face I have ever seen\". </p> <p>Editorial kindness rarely extends to indulging the egos of hopeful undergraduates, even those with faces as beautiful as the young Price. But Spender read the manuscripts and realising, from page one, that he had discovered a great writer, rushed the stories into print. Like Byron, Reynolds Price awoke and found himself famous. Within 18 months, and at the age of 24, he was hailed as one of the major novelists of his time with A Long and Happy Life (a work which has never been out of print in America since 1962). </p> <p>Price's career thereafter went swimmingly. He returned to his native North Carolina to take up a position teaching creative writing at his alma mater, Duke University. He wrote novels, won prizes, made heaps of money and had, it seemed, a charmed life. Charm and a bubbling wit were what everyone noted about him. \"You make any house you are in golden,\" Spender once told him. </p> <p>In 1984, Price's world disintegrated. He was diagnosed with cancer - a one-foot-long, slimy growth \"as thick as a pencil\" had braided itself round his spinal cord. He called it \"the eel\". Price was, literally, at the cutting edge of oncology. Duke's medical school led the world in the surgical treatment of cancer. Its expert scalpel and radiotherapy killed the eel. That was the good news. The bad news was that the 4,000 rads (units of radiation) bombarded into Price's neck destroyed his nervous system. </p> <p>It was the cruellest of cures. At 51, Price found himself cancer-free but paraplegic. Other Americans might have enriched themselves with a vindictive malpractice suit. Reynolds confronted his condition not as an aggrieved patient, but as an author. Out of the experience of losing his lower body, he wrote a book with the ironic title A Whole New Life. </p> <p>Reading it is painful, humbling and intensely uplifting. As \"an American with disability\" (as the federal statute puts it), Price prefers the honest Anglo-Saxon terms \"gimp\" and \"cripple\". The most eloquent of writers, when occasion calls, he uses language with a thug's brutality. Talking of his sanitary arrangements he notes: \"Since the muscles that expel faeces from the lower intestines are inactive in most of the paralysed, some form of rubber-gloved manual removal is generally required. Whatever the individual gimp hits on for a workable method, he or she quickly becomes as familiar with his own piss and shit as any Paleolithic cave-dweller.\" </p> <p>If - as I have been doing over the last week - you converse with Price, you are aware of two things. He smiles and cracks jokes (hilariously funny jokes) continuously. And he writhes with pain continuously. His spine is destroyed, but still hurts excruciatingly: the eel's revenge. He refuses to use painkillers on the grounds that they dull his mind. </p> <p> S ince embarking on his whole new life, Price has, in most critics' judgment, written even better than he did in his old life. It's an extraordinary achievement. We ritually salute handicapped bravery - but often with a secret condescension. We know that those athletes in the Paralympics couldn't really compete with their unhandicapped colleagues. </p> <p>Last week some magnificently obstinate wheelchair-using American hikers battled their way to a peak in New Hampshire to force the Appalachian Mountain Club to do their legal duty and install a handicapped toilet, with grab bars, at 3,800 feet. But, in our hearts, we know that a mountaineer in a wheelchair is never going to be as good as someone with the use of his legs. </p> <p>With Price (and, I suspect, with Stephen Hawking) it is different. The human mind can conquer disability and soar above it. But don't take my word for it, get hold of one of the 20-odd books that Reynolds Price has written since 1984 and find out for yourself.</p>",
  "<p>London taxis have been doing it for years, buses for even longer, and retailers do it with every delivery truck they send out on the road. Plastering advertisements on vehicles is nothing new. But the latest trend in the US goes one step further. </p> <p>Two new companies in California are paying the public to have their cars wrapped in advertisements and brand logos, and drivers are signing up in their thousands. The cars are fully covered in a high-quality vinyl adhesive, guaranteed not to damage paintwork when it is removed. The ad can be for anything from Head &amp; Shoulders to Andersen Consulting, and the gaudier and more traffic-stopping the better. And in return for becoming mobile billboards, drivers are paid up to $400 a month for as long as a campaign runs. One of these companies, FreeCar Media, is even giving people brand-new cars to drive around for two years. All the driver pays for is petrol and insurance. </p> <p>The firms act as middlemen, matching drivers with suitable brands. Young executives, for example, may be good for promoting an investment firm. Fitness enthusiasts who frequent gyms and the outdoors could help sell bottled water. Families could promote a new theme park. It's not only novel, they say, it's high exposure; the average American spends two hours a day in his car and drives over 40 miles. And for the drivers, it's payback time - an opportunity to make money out of the very companies that have bled consumers for years. </p> <p>\"The US advertising industry is worth $215bn and we're putting a portion of that back into consumers' pockets,\" says Daniel Shifrin, president and founder of Autowraps.com which, since its January launch, has signed up 50,000 drivers in 15 states, and 40 advertisers. These include Procter &amp; Gamble, Kraft Foods, Coca-Cola and several dot.com start-ups. Shifrin, whose idea came to him in a traffic jam, has wrapped around 350 cars so far, and says his San Francisco company is growing \"like a virus\". </p> <p>Lawrence Butler, chairman and co-founder of rival firm FreeCar Media in Los Angeles, says he was inspired by the wrapped buses he saw in LA and New York. \"I thought, why not on private vehicles? If you're on the freeway or the car's parked across the street, you can't just ignore it.\" And he claims clients get not just mobile ads, but mobile salespeople. \"People are so inquisitive about the cars they're rolling their windows down and asking drivers to talk about it, so the driver becomes an ambassador for the product.\" </p> <p>There's no chance of drivers pocketing the cash and hiding the car in their garage. Vehicles are inspected monthly for mileage and condition (Autowraps.com insists they're washed at least once a month) and FreeCar Media installs electronic mapping devices that allow advertisers to keep track of where their drivers are going. </p> <p>Both firms plan to expand internationally; FreeCar Media, with 100,000 drivers and four advertisers, already has drivers signed up in London. And both want to use their cars for non-profit causes. Butler and his team paid for cars to be driven around during last week's Democratic national convention in LA urging people to vote (although they were wrapped, in rather partisan style, in large photos of Al Gore). Shifrin is talking to anti-drink-driving groups and says he wants to persuade anti-smoking organisations to pay teenagers to drive cars emblazoned with logos such as \"Smoking sucks\". </p> <p>Dominique Hanssens, Bud Knapp Professor of Marketing at UCLA, sees car wrapping taking off: \"There's a good deal of burnout and saturation with traditional media. Most people simply zap through commercials on TV, so traditional advertising is not getting the reach advertisers pay for.\" The problem, says Hanssens, is overkill. \"If it becomes every third or fourth car that's wrapped, people will zap through that mentally too. But it's unusual, and I'm not surprised it originated here. It sounds crazy enough.\" </p> <p>The folks at American Esquire magazine thought the same thing when they were looking for an April Fool's article for their spring issue. Unaware of the existence of the two firms, contributing editor Ted Fishman dreamed up a bogus internet start-up called FreeWheelz that gave away free cars and financed them by wrapping the vehicles in ads. He even went so far as to set up a fictitious company website to back up his article. </p> <p>But no one got the joke, and soon Esquire was fielding calls and emails from willing drivers and intrigued reporters alike. \"Ted thought, what's the most absurd business plan I can think of? But it just wasn't over-the-top enough,\" concedes Peter Griffin, Esquire's deputy editor. </p> <p>\"It's a reflection on our society that by the time he came up with the idea, pitched it to his editors, and had the thing printed, there were companies already doing it,\" says Butler, who admits to a feeling of panic when he first saw the article. FreeCar Media was just about to launch, and when Butler got in touch, the lads at Esquire saw a business opportunity. \"They said, if that many people are signing up there's something in it,\" says Butler. So they sold him the names they had gathered, plus rights to the FreeWheelz website. Butler learned that there may be such a thing as a free car, but not a free car website. The cost to him? A cool $25,000.</p>"
