  "<p>The states of America are united by at least one characteristic: an obsession with race. White suburbanites bemoan the loss of their cities to crime, drugs and - by extension - black neighbourhoods. When they say, \"It's a jungle down there\", you're supposed to know what they mean. Black community leaders wonder out loud why the shops in their areas are owned by recently arrived Koreans. US cities are divided cleanly along ethnic axes - an enduring American apartheid. </p> <p>George W Bush put almost all the black members of the Republican party on the stage at his convention to prove his open-mindedness. Al Gore argues that there needs to be a greater national awareness of racism before any progress is possible. </p> <p>Actually, the awareness of race as an issue could not be higher. What might be needed, conversely, is to take the race issue down the agenda - and take some of the political heat out of a debate which has become distorted by party political point-scoring, white guilt and overzealous legal action. </p> <p>Nowhere is a new approach more needed than in the workplace. Racism in any form stains the working environment, and has to be stamped out. But hypersensitivity about colour or religious affiliation can be counterproductive. A friend of mine is a senior civil servant in the US government. He is an ultra-progressive, humane, open-minded white man. (Oh, and he's gay. In America, where group membership is minutely calibrated, that probably matters). He is currently under investigation for anti-semitic and racist behaviour. </p> <p>A Jewish woman has accused him of overlooking her for a position because of her faith. The process entails interviews with equal opportunities officers and rigorous questioning of his own beliefs. The fact that he was unaware she was Jewish makes no difference. And an African-American man has accused him of racism after being suspended for sexual harassment. (This is where workplace politics get really sticky.) The man in question placed his hand on a female colleague's bottom and squeezed, in full view of a dozen people, in the office canteen. (Oh, she's black, too. In America that definitely matters.) </p> <p>US managers say that it is many more times more difficult to fire, discipline or warn a non-white employee for fear of lawsuits and bad PR. This is crazy. An equal society is one in which people are treated on the basis of their abilities and effort, not colour or creed. This must work both ways - in firing as well as hiring. Otherwise, firms will be reluctant to hire people from ethnic minorities in the first place - not because they are racist, but because they are afraid of being labelled as such if the recruit is not up to the job and has to be dismissed. </p> <p>The problem is that a whole industry of lawyers, lobbyists, politicians, equal opportunities officers and human resources specialists has been built on the premise that US citizens are incapable of acting in an enlightened fashion. And few are prepared to take this lobby on, for fear of being accused of racism themselves. </p> <p>None of which is to say that racism is over and done with. Far from it. Or that there should not be the strictest sanctions for those who act in discriminatory ways. But America needs a dose of the optimism about human nature enshrined in its constitution, and echoed by leaders such as Martin Luther King. Real racism is bad enough: there's no need to see it lurking everywhere. </p> <p> Strangely, there is one form of prejudice that the US endorses enthusiastically - ageism. At a conference in New York last week, the convenor asked all the \"young people, whose enthusiasm, energy and ability to think outside the box are so needed\" to stand up. This being America, a few dozen eager youths leapt to their feet to receive a ripple of applause. At a stroke the convenor therefore insulted anybody not defined as \"young\" and patronised those who were. </p> <p>In a separate session, a speaker invited his 12-year-old son, who spent the entire time playing a handheld computer game (and it was difficult to blame him), to tell the audience about his concerns for the future. On hearing his name, the young man in question looked up, startled, and said: \"Well, if an asteroid hit us, that would be really really bad, wouldn't it?\" At times like this, an asteroid strike seems like the least we deserve. </p> <p>\u0095 Richard Reeves is director of futures at the Industrial Society.

  "<p>George W Bush's campaign has withdrawn a television ad after the Democrats claimed it included subliminal messages attacking his opponent.</p> <p>In the ad an image of Al Gore appears on screen followed by the word \"rats\", which flashes up in capital letters for a split-second before the word \"bureaucrats\" appears.</p> <p>Bush said he was convinced the word had not been used intentionally, adding that he did not need to rely on subliminal messages to get his message across. But he admitted that the ad had now been taken out of circulation. </p> <p>The gaffe was the second by the Bush campaign in a week. Last week, Bush was overheard describing a New York Times reporter as a \"major league asshole\" in a remark that was caught on a live microphone.</p>",
  "Baroness Brooke, who has died aged 92, was an affable pillar of the Conservative party - a vice-chairman for a decade, and one of its most deft and tenacious committee women. It was typical of her warm nature that when her husband, Henry Brooke, the former Tory Home Secretary, fell ill with Parkinson's disease in the 1970s, she withdrew from public life to nurse him. <p>The two shared an old-fashioned puritanism. Such an attitude provoked gales of laughter in the Lords during its 1969 debate on tattooing, when Lady Brooke said: \"I can definitely say how disturbed I would have been as a young girl if I had found my noble kinsman [and husband] already tattooed with 'I love you Diana'.\" </p> <p>Born in Llanwern, west Wales, the youngest daughter of Canon Alfred Mathews, a vicar and former Welsh rugby international, Barbara Brooke went from Queen Anne's school, Caversham, to the Gloucester Training College of Domestic Science. She taught at secondary school in Dagenham, Essex, and qualified as a nurse at St Thomas's hospital, London. It was a background that inspired standards of hard work, honesty and godliness. </p> <p>She caught the eye of Henry Brooke at a party given by her brother at Balliol College, Oxford. They married in 1933 and settled in West Hampstead. After rural Wales, Barbara found London lonely: \"It wasn't until I began to push a pram that I really got to know people,\" she recalled. </p> <p>Barbara made her political debut by taking the working-class Kilburn ward from Labour in 1948, to join her husband on Hampstead borough council. She soon showed brilliance in committee work, covering her steely determination with tact and affability, and, as chairman of housing in 1951, was the first to introduce differential rents. Fellow Tories decided it was her impact that helped Henry get the Tory selection for Hampstead when the parliamentary seat fell vacant just before the 1950 general election. </p> <p>In 1954, as vice-chairman of the Conservative party organisation, Barbara beguiled many by her country-girl mock simplicity. But her enormous energy, tenacity and good nature kept her in the job for a decade. Among other things, she saw that the Tories, who relied overwhelmingly on women volunteers, underused them in mainstream politics - she was shocked to find, for example, that only one of the 19 Conservative women candidates in the 1955 election was in a safe seat. She tried to persuade fellow vice-chairman John Hare (later Lord Blakenham) to get winnable seats to interview at least one woman. </p> <p>In 1964, Barbara was made a life peer, two years before her husband. She spoke in favour of compulsory religious education, grant-aided schools, against training doctors entirely within hospitals, and in favour of giving teachers housing in slum areas into which they were being posted. In 1967, she became frontbench spokesman on welfare, while Lord Brooke was frontbench spokesman on the Home Office - the first time that a married couple had held such posts. In 1968, she became president of the National Union of Conservative Associations, only the third such woman in Tory history. </p> <p>Her greatest personal initiative probably came 25 years ago when, as chairman of Godolphin and Latymer school, she persuaded fellow governors and parents to defy the Inner London Education Authority, which wanted it to merge with another school and become a comprehensive. Her plan was to turn Godolphin into an independent school, and she helped raise the \u00a3500,000 to stake it. </p> <p>She is survived by two daughters and two sons, the elder, Peter, being a former Northern Ireland Secretary and the younger, Sir Henry, a lord justice of appeal. </p> <p>\u0095 Barbara Mathews Brooke, Baroness Brooke of Ystradfellte, born January 14 1908; died September 1 2000</p>",
  "Six years after his banishment to the wilderness, the Italian parliament returned from its summer holiday yesterday to find Silvio Berlusconi making a spectacular comeback as leader of the centre-right opposition. <p>Later this month he will try to topple the government and trigger a snap general election, which the polls say he will win.</p> <p>He has mobilised his family, yacht and media empire for an American-style campaign of glamour and money.</p> <p>Posters with his tanned, beaming face are appearing on billboards in advance of his attack on the government's budget, which may lead to a confidence vote.</p> <p>Mr Berlusconi, 64, returned to Rome with 25 \"recipes\" for a better future devised with advisers at his Bermuda holiday home. He will board his yacht next weekend for a campaign cruise to signal the countdown to his restoration as prime minister, the job he lost in 1994 after seven tumultuous months.</p> <p>His daughter Marina, 34, vice-president of his holding company Fininvest, has posed in a black bikini for the lifestyle magazine Oggi, which described her as a powerful businesswoman with a super-feminine physique.</p> <p>Kristen Pazik, the girlfriend of his son Pier Silvio, posed nude for GQ magazine. She described her potential father-in-law as the most fascinating man in the world.</p> <p>But Sergio Romano, a commentator tipped to be foreign minister in a Berlusconi cabinet, warned that flaunting success and beauty might alienate traditionalists. \"For every vote he gains from the Bermuda villa image, he loses one,\" he said.</p> <p>Mr Berlusconi, who owns AC Milan football club and whose family controls the private television network Mediaset, has shaken off most of the corruption allegations which dogged him through the 90s.</p> <p>He launched a new era in Italian electioneering when he made a 37,000-tonne cruiser ship his Forza Italia party headquarters for last April's regional elections.</p> <p>The nine-party government coalition, which includes Marxists, Greens, and former Christian Democrats, hopes to revive its popularity with a tax-cutting budget.</p> <p>It is split on whether to dump the technocrat prime minister, Giuliano Amato. To counter Mr Berlusconi's charisma there is a growing clamour to install the telegenic mayor of Rome, Francesco Rutelli, who would be a fresh face untainted by corruption.</p>",
  "It was 35 years ago that civil rights marchers were attacked by state troopers in Selma as they demonstrated for the rights of black people to vote. The mayor then was a skinny young appliance salesman with a crewcut called Joe Smitherman who referred to the leader of the marchers as \"Martin Luther Coon\". Today the same Joe Smitherman is fighting to hold onto his office in the face of a challenge that would see the first black mayor of the city that stands as a landmark in the history of the civil rights movement. <p>Claims of electoral fraud and intimidation, and allegations that vehicles belonging to campaigners against Smitherman have been firebombed, have brought veteran civil rights campaigners from across the country and US Justice Department officials to this city of 24,000 people. 'Joe's Gotta Go', is the slogan of a volunteer army of students and activists who have been declared unwelcome guests in the local press just as they were 35 years ago. This weekend Martin Luther King III and veteran civil rights leader the Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth were in town to campaign. Last week it was hip-hop stars from New Orleans trying to persuade teenagers to vote for the first time. </p> <p>If Smitherman, now 70, wins, it will be his 10th victory, one that will act as a reminder that some things have not changed since the violence of what was known as bloody Sunday in 1965 when state troopers tear-gassed and cracked the heads of the 600 black and white marchers who sought to cross the Pettus Bridge over the Alabama River and challenge Governor George Wallace and his battle cry of \"segregation forever\". </p> <p>The violence led to the legendary Selma-Montgomery march and to the Voters Rights Act pushed through in 1965 by President Lyndon Johnson as America reacted in horror to the scenes of violence and bigotry and the four attendant killings by Klansmen, troopers and local racists. </p> <p>Selma has been a black majority city since 1984 and blacks now make up 65% of the 14,000 registered voters but Smitherman has remained in office. In the primary last month he came in ahead of his main challenger, black businessman James Perkins Jnr, with 4,352 votes to 4,076. Third place went to another black candidate, attorney and iman Yusuf Salaam. Today the voters make their final decision. </p> <p>Smitherman, now heavier and white-haired and living alone with two cats in a house rented from his lawyer daughter, is angry about the influx of outsiders and claims that he has been misrepresented as a bigot for years. His son Steve, a property developer and former policeman who is holding the fort at the Smitherman campaign headquarters, said that he had met the Reverend Martin Luther King as a boy. \"He was a well-spoken gentleman, a lot different from what we're running against this time.\" </p> <p><b> Violence</b><br> </p> <p> His father's oft-quoted remark, he said, was a slip of the tongue which happened because there was at the time a white council man named Martin Coon. \"The press has played it into the ground ever since,\" said Smitherman. </p> <p>Race, he said, was no longer the main issue and he had voted for a black council clerk against two white candidates. As for the alleged car-bombing of the vehicles of the 'Joe's Gotta Go' campaign, he believed that it was either an accident or had been carried out deliberately to win sympathy for Perkins and generate publicity. Perkins supporters say this is the classic explanation of any acts of violence throughout the civil rights movement. </p> <p>Smitherman's supporters point to a showdown with the Ku Klux Klan whom he told to get out of town when they showed up at city hall in 1979. His opponents remember him barricading the entrance to the federal poverty programme in 1970 because he said it discriminated against whites. Townsend Davis in his history of the civil rights movement, Weary Feet, Rested Souls, acknowledges that Smitherman has been \"chameleonlike\" on racial issues and \"the themes of reconciliation and repentance\" have become standard in his speeches. </p> <p>James Perkins, who was a schoolboy during the 1965 marches - his mother was a nurse who patched up the marchers - is suffering from 'politician's voice' but is able to articulate why he believes his third tilt at the Smitherman crown will be decisive and why it deserves to be. </p> <p>\"A lot has changed here but not for the better,\" he said, sitting in his back yard as campaigners stuffed envelopes. \"I was in the first fully integrated classes during the desegregation era and they were 50/50 black and white. Now they are 90% black because all the whites have left the public school system.\" Residential areas were still largely, if unofficially, segregated except in the downtown area, he said. </p> <p>Nowhere in the civil rights iconography holds a higher place than the Pettus Bridge, and at a 'Joe's Gotta Go' rally there on a hot afternoon there are people who remember vividly the crack of billy-club on skull and the whiff of teargas as the state troopers sang a jeering 'Bye, Bye Blackbird' while driving the marchers back, leaving 70 in hospital. </p> <p>Lily Brown, aged 69, from Birmingham, was kicked by a police horse during the rampage and suffered a blood clot. She is back on the bridge today. \"Everything changed but nothing changed,\" she said. \"I can't for the life of me understand why they still have the man who oppressed us as mayor.\" </p> <p>Diane Moton has a special reason to remember the final march to Montgomery. Her brother Leroy Moton, a young volunteer with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, was in a car on his way back from Montgomery with a white activist from Detroit, Viola Liuzzo, when they were spotted by armed Klansmen and pursued along Highway 80 at 100 miles an hour. Liuzzo was shot and killed and her brother survived by playing dead. </p> <p>\"I thought I was going to die here,\" she said, explaining why she was returning to campaign after many years away. </p> <p>Joanne Bland, who founded the National Voting Rights Museum in the centre of town, blamed \"intimidation and a sense of hopelessness over the years\" as the reasons why Smitherman was still in office. The museum records the blunter times when signs stated: \"We serve colored. Carry out only.\" </p> <p>This has been the most bitterly fought election campaign that anyone can remember, not least because of accusations of betrayals against black people who are backing Smitherman. The Smitherman camp are particularly pleased that Yusuf Salaam is telling his supporters not to back Perkins who he feels has been disrespectful towards Muslims, a charge Perkins denies. There are also claims by the Perkins camp that Smitherman's supporters are bamboozling old people into signing over their absentee ballots. </p> <p><b> Disillusioned</b><br> </p> <p> As the bridge rally ends, there is activity in the Smitherman headquarters where almost all the afternoon's campaigners are black. One of them, Timfreit Drane, said that he had previously campaigned for Perkins but was now disillusioned. \"My interest is the betterment of my city. Perkins is supposed to be a businessman [in computer technology] but not one of his businesses are in operation,\" he said. </p> <p>On the eve of the election, the strains of Lift Every Voice and Sing in Selma's Tabernacle baptist church drown out the distance wail of the freight train and the fluttering of hundreds of fans. The pastor, Dr Aaron Dobynes, likens the moment to the sighting of the Promised Land: \"I feel the same sense of anticipation as the people leaving Egypt ...we want to thank God for the victory that will be ours.\" </p> <p>When the Tabernacle was first built in 1922 the architect was told that it was unacceptable that a black church should open onto Selma's main street. The instruction was ignored. As the rally ended last night the mainly black congregation spilled out onto the main street. Today they will discover whether another long link with the past has finally been broken.</p>"
