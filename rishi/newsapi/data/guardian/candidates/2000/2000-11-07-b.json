  "Today America will begin to say farewell. It will be a long goodbye, one that fits the outsized character of the man. For the United States has three months to let go of a leader who has, by turns, enthralled, appalled and seduced them for eight compelling years. Bill Clinton won't officially become the ex-president till a minute past noon on January 20 2001, but by late tonight he will be yesterday's man. He will lose his throne, either to his appointed heir or to the son of the king he slayed to get there. One of them will be the president-elect and, in a heartbeat, Clinton will slip from emblem of America's present to holdover from America's past. <p>His fellow Americans will miss him - more, perhaps, than they realise. They'll miss the two terms of peace and record prosperity, of course, but they might even miss the psychodrama: an eight-year rollercoaster ride so turbulent that those who followed it become queasy at the recollection. They'll miss the daily triumphs and disasters of a character of Shakespearean complexity, a president who stirred in the American people passions of love and hatred unseen since the days of John F Kennedy and Richard Nixon - and almost never aroused by a single man. Above all, they will miss his signature feature, one which may well have redefined the presidency itself: an almost eerie gift for empathy. </p> <p>I will miss him, too. For the years of Clinton's American journey matched my own. I first came to live and work in the country in 1992, just as he exploded on to the national scene. I watched him run for president, and stayed to see him do the job. From then on, and for several years, I either watched, read or wrote about Clinton nearly every day. Just as future TV documentary makers keen to evoke the 1990s will flash up an image of the president, I suspect that, when I look back on my late 20s or early 30s, I will do the same. And tonight that era will come to a close. </p> <p>The memories come so fast that it's not easy to separate them. That 1992 election alone was so chock-full of scandal and turnarounds, such a vintage campaign, that it's hard to forget any of it - whether it was Gennifer with a G, the Vietnam draft-dodging letter, written by Clinton while a student at Oxford, or Hillary on 60 Minutes insisting she had been no Tammy Wynette standing by her man, and that if you didn't like her husband, then, \"Heck, don't vote for him.\" </p> <p>It was a crazy year, but it was that Clinton gift for empathy which saw him through. I had heard about it before - Republicans had already ridiculed the Arkansas governor's tendency to begin sentences with \"I feel\" rather than \"I think\", a habit that reached its apotheosis in the legendary \"I feel your pain.\" But there was no substitute for seeing it in action. </p> <p>Of course there were the moments widely witnessed, such as those few seconds during one of the televised debates, when the candidates were asked how the recession had affected them personally. Clinton turned the query around, asking the questioner how she had suffered. Meanwhile, his opponent, George Bush Snr, was caught on camera checking his watch. </p> <p>But there were also the tiny episodes, too small to be reported in their own right, which offered a glimpse of Clinton's sheer talent for people. It's perhaps hard, after this year's lacklustre contest, to imagine the excitement Clinton generated that autumn. \"The failed governor of a small southern state,\" the Republicans had called him. But the voters didn't see it that way. I remember two moments from a Clinton-Gore bus tour through the American heartland. It was a swing through southern Georgia and the buzz was palpable. People didn't just attend rallies, they lined the highways in crowds to catch a glimpse of the man who would be president. Some held banners urging the young governor with the gargantuan appetite (he can eat a whole apple in a single bite) to stop awhile and sample the local peaches or peanuts - and he always did. </p> <p>His aides would get enraged, every stop delaying the tour by a few more crucial minutes. By the end of a campaign day, Clinton would be running four or five hours late, but it didn't matter. In the town square at Valdosta a crowd that had gathered for a 9pm rally waited till 2am. Under floodlights on that September night, they cheered themselves hoarse. </p> <p>Earlier that day, we'd been in a small town called Tifton. Clinton had delivered the usual stump speech, his throat sore, when it began to pour with rain. The reporters ran for cover, inside a makeshift press room where there was the usual supply of chicken drumsticks and Diet Coke. Eventually an Israeli journalist tapped me on the shoulder. \"Come outside,\" he said. \"Look at this.\" </p> <p>The candidate was still out there, shaking the hands of fewer than a dozen elderly voters who had stayed out in the rain. He was talking to each one - not just a \"Hi, how are you,\" but a proper conversation - as the rain streamed down his face and theirs. His aides were urging him to hurry out, desperate to whisk him on to the bus and into a new shirt. This was not a pose to show how much he cared about ordinary people: there was not a single camera to record it. Besides me and the Israeli, no one saw it. But Clinton did it all the same. </p> <p>Who knows why? Maybe the legend was right: maybe Clinton believed that so long as he met every single voter in America, they would all vote for him. Maybe his childhood (widowed mother, alcoholic stepfather) had left him with a near-addictive need for human contact, affection and adulation. Maybe he just cared. </p> <p>Either way, it worked and worked. The crowds got bigger, his voice got hoarser and the empathy gift won that election. I returned to London determined to get work in America that would let me see the next chapter of the story: how Clinton the candidate would become Clinton the president. </p> <p>The transition was not easy. A dozen books have recounted the political errors of those first months. Day one saw a promise to let gays into the military, a move which only confirmed the brass's worst suspicions about the new, draft-dodging commander-in-chief. Later Hillary Clinton took control of healthcare reform - a move that would bring the administration's greatest defeat. The first lady presented Congress with an almost comically complicated blueprint for a new system: expressed as a diagram, it looked like a circuit-board for the space shuttle. The fact that the plan had been hatched by a taskforce of wonks meeting with Hillary in secret added to its Soviet-era aura. By 1994 the plan was dead, and the Clinton administration badly wounded. </p> <p> Things were no easier for the president himself. The Washington establishment was not sure what to make of this brash southern newcomer. They were both excited by and disdainful of him. They sniffed at the Arkansans who piled into town, supporting their beloved Razorbacks football team with the uncouth chant \"Oooo pig soo-eeee!\" For the Washington elite, Clinton and his friends were hicks, plain and simple. </p> <p>The greybeards also disdained his way of doing business. They heard that the president would have long \"bull sessions\" more akin to the college seminar room than the Oval Office. They saw the pizza delivery bikes skidding up to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, as the young, novice staff worked through the night. While Bush had been a grown-up, Clinton's White House seemed to lack adult supervision. </p> <p>The word of the hour back then was \"unpresidential\". The Washington snobs disliked Clinton's habit of answering reporters' questions while still out of breath, pale thighs wobbling. They winced when he answered an MTV inquiry about his taste in underwear: \"Boxers or briefs?\" </p> <p>What the scolds did not realise was that all this \"unpresidential\" behaviour was connected to the president's greatest strength: his common touch. He was comfortable with people. So when a little girl, invited to the Oval Office to take part in a candle-lighting ceremony to mark the Jewish festival of Chanukah, yelped as her hair caught fire, guess who put out the flames and calmed her nerves? Not an aide, but the prez himself. </p> <p>Clinton was like that Star Trek character, the empath, who can psychically read the emotions of those before him; he had a mind-reader's ability to see into the hearts of any individual or group he faced. </p> <p>I saw the trick at work in Baltimore, when the president was out selling his healthcare package. He was addressing an outdoor crowd of thousands of hospital staff. I was standing among a group of nurses, who began chatting and whispering. Their minds were wandering. Somehow, from faraway, Clinton sensed it. He suddenly declared that his plan really mattered, that it would affect all of them, nurses especially - and that they all had to listen up. The women around me hushed. </p> <p>The gift did not save him from the failure of the healthcare programme, a defeat that was endorsed by 1994's mid-term elections, which the Republicans won by a landslide. Overnight Newt Gingrich became the hottest politician in America, cheerily explaining that he would be prime minister to Clinton's now largely ceremonial president. Soon Clinton was forced to tell a press conference why he and his office were still \"relevant\". </p> <p>But the mood changed. On April 19 1995 a right-wing extremist detonated a bomb at a government building in Oklahoma City, leaving 168 dead. Suddenly the anti-government bile of Gingrich's revolutionaries left a much harsher taste in the mouth: America had seen where such talk could lead. </p> <p>Clinton stepped forward as the calmer voice, leading the Oklahoma families in mourning. Perhaps for the first time, he looked presidential - a father of the nation at a moment of crisis. Just then, America needed a leader who would feel their pain. </p> <p>In fact, though no official would ever say it out loud, mourning worked well for Clinton: he gave good funeral. He knew how to touch just the right nerve. I remember a ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, dedicating a memorial to those who had died in the Lockerbie bombing. He spoke well, as always, but it was afterwards that he came into his own. A huddle of relatives gathered around him. He spoke to each of them, but then he extended his big hands to reach the ones who had not pressed forward, the ones too shy to approach the president themselves. He encouraged them and beckoned them closer, his eyes finding the hesitant widow or retiring father who was holding back. Again, I looked around: no cameras. The TV crews had already got their pictures; Clinton was not doing it for appearances' sake. He stayed there a full hour over schedule, maddening his handlers and listening to the stories of bereaved loved ones - and not a word was ever written about it. </p> <p>This talent or knack or psychosis - whatever it was, it secured Clinton's position as president. Groups who had once been suspicious began to like and eventually adore him. </p> <p>Take black Americans. In 1992 they had big doubts about Clinton. He was a white politician from the deep south, a Democrat who had signalled his \"centrist\" credentials by attacking black rapper Sister Souljah and by breaking off from the campaign to return to his home state - to order the execution of a retarded black man convicted of murder. </p> <p> Yet within a few years Clinton would be hailed by Toni Morrison, the African-American Nobel laureate, as \"our first black president\" and by the rapper Ice-T as \"a brother\". What had changed? Clinton had saved affirmative action from the Republican axe, but he'd also signed a welfare reform bill which hit black families hard. No, it wasn't policy which sealed the bond between Clinton and black America. It was a more subtle connection. The president displayed a comfort with black audiences that was unheard of among white politicians. He could deliver an impromptu speech-cum-sermon from the pulpit of a black church that had civil rights activists admitting they had heard nothing so inspiring since the days of Martin Luther King. The result is a white president who enjoys 95% approval ratings among African-Americans to this very day. </p> <p>Jewish voters tell a similar story. They were wary of a southern baptist Democrat in 1992: they feared he might be another Jimmy Carter, too sympathetic to the Palestinians. But Clinton reassured them, using his secret weapon: emotional intelligence. It was his instinct and body language that led to that 1993 handshake on the White House lawn between the PLO's Yasser Arafat and Israel's Yitzhak Rabin. And when Rabin was assassinated two years later, it was Clinton who knew how to massage Israel's wounded spirit. He spoke to them, via TV, in their own language, addressing the dead Rabin with the words \"Shalom chaver\" - goodbye friend. The phrase had not existed in Hebrew before then; now it's common Israeli parlance. And so, in 1996, Jewish Americans turned out - alongside blacks and women and Hispanics and trade unions and every other group who felt understood by Clinton - to give him four more years. </p> <p>I took that as my cue to head back to Britain. I reckoned we'd seen the best of Clinton. The second term would be more of the same, only less so. And for the first year, 1997, I seemed to be vindicated: the economy prospered on auto-pilot and Clinton barely had to break a sweat. But in the first weeks of 1998 the sky fell in. The allegations of a dress-staining affair with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky, the finger-wagging denial, the talk of perjury and impeachment - it all came so fast. The Washington punditocracy predicted that the Arkansas hick would be sent back to Little Rock by the end of the week. But they forgot who they were dealing with. Clinton was not just the Comeback Kid, the Houdini who had survived a thousand scrapes. He was also the empath-in-chief, and now he got the return on his investment: the American people empathised back. </p> <p>They had already forgiven or ignored the waves of scandal that had broken with every season of the first term: Whitewater, Travelgate, Filegate and all the other gates never really swung. The American people apparently felt the same way about the president as a former Arkansas state senator I once interviewed. He had worked with the then governor throughout the 1980s and had little sympathy for him politically. But he was adamant: \"Bill Clinton doesn't give duck crap about money.\" Americans could see that for themselves: they had a president who had never owned his own house (he had lived in the Arkansas governor's mansion since he was 32, moving from there directly to the White House). He may have been a shameless hustler after votes, but few voters believed Clinton was ever in the business of lining his own pockets. That's why all the stuff about Whitewater never stuck. </p> <p>Zippergate was different: Clinton may not have lusted after cash, but Americans knew he lusted after flesh. They knew, too, that he had an indisciplined, selfish, self-indulgent streak. They knew he could be reckless and self-destructive, taking a risk he must have known could have ended his presidency. </p> <p>But here's where empathy became a two-way street. Despite a year-long hammering from the Republicans, and a press united in its disgust for the president's actions, the public stood by him. Americans told pollsters they hated what Clinton had done but, from the first revelations in January 1998 to the senate trial a year later, they remained consistent, approving his performance as president and insisting that he should not be removed from office. </p> <p>They understood him, just as he had understood them. He had always seemed to cut them a little slack, and now they returned the compliment. In the autumn of 1998 they watched the tapes of a beleaguered president assaulted by excruciatingly personal questions from Kenneth Starr's prosecutors - grainy footage with the visual grammar of a hostage video - and they sided with him. Just like Hillary, they stood by their man. </p> <p>Once, when speaking about his faith, Clinton described the God he believed in as \"the God of second chances\" - and he let out a little smile. That was the Clinton of early 1999: a lucky man, blessed with forgiveness. </p> <p>In the end, he was less Houdini than Rasputin. The Republicans tried and tried to kill him, but they failed, destroying themselves in the attempt. Where are his enemies now? Gingrich was forced out of the Speaker's chair after the impeachment debacle, so was his successor. The rest of the president's persecutors in the House are in tight congressional races today, desperate just to hold on to their seats. </p> <p>And as for Clinton, this is his last day in total command. I can look back now on the last eight years and admit that we, those of us who covered him, were spoiled. We saw a president with towering political skills and a serious intellect - a man who could rattle off the fine-print detail of any policy programme anywhere in America and discuss the domestic politics of most countries in the world, a leader who would think nothing of calling up the great academics and writers of the day, often in the small hours, for a late-night, unarranged t\u00e9-te-\u00e0-t\u00e9te. </p> <p>And there was that gift for people. I admit it, it spoiled me - it even skewed my judgment. I came back from America to cover Britain's 1997 election, and was soon whispering to friends my anxiety that Tony Blair's success was far from assured: he got such little enthusiasm from the crowds. I'd got used to winning candidates getting a Clinton-sized response. Now I can see that I had witnessed a once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon. Like someone who heard Sinatra sing in the 1950s or watched John McEnroe play tennis in the 1980s, I had seen a maestro at the height of his powers. Clinton was the Pele of politics, and we might wait half a century to see his like again. </p> <p>Today America is choosing between two half-Clintons. They can have a version of his smarts, in Al Gore, or a version of his warmth, in George W Bush. Clinton wants the voters to choose Gore, of course, to protect his legacy. But if America picks Bush, that will be a kind of compliment, too. For it will prove that an ability to connect, which Bush has and Gore does not, is now an indispensable part of the job - thanks to Clinton, the king of empathy. </p> <p>Smarts or warmth, one or the other is on offer today. Voters who want both will just have to wait. Or they can take one last look at the man from Hope - and remember.</p>",
  "The US president, Bill Clinton, said today that the arrival of election day may have made him wistful, but it did not make him a \"lame duck\" president. <p>\"I've got another 10 weeks to quack,\" he said, as the political stars of his wife and his vice president threatened to eclipse his. </p> <p>Asked if he would seek office again, Mr Clinton said, \"I don't think I'm going to be running for anything. I'm just going to try to be a good citizen.\" </p> <p>He added: \"I am going to be happy doing whatever I do. I've had a great life. I've been very lucky.\" </p> <p>Mr Clinton flew to New York yesterday night and was among the first voters with his wife, Hillary, and daughter, Chelsea. </p> <p>He said he would begin calling radio stations in hotly contested states sometime after dawn to encourage people to vote, but beyond that, his election day schedule was rather loose.</p> <p>Mr Clinton predicted Al Gore would win the presidential election and the first lady would become the next junior senator from New York, provided that minorities, immigrants and the working poor vote \"in the same percentage they are in the population.\" </p> <p>\"I've just got a good feeling,\" Mr Clinton said about Mr Gore's chances. \"I think he's run a good campaign. I think he's really been good out there the last couple of weeks ... I think he's really been in gear and you also see a lot of our people getting energised.\" </p> <p>As for his own sentiments about not being on the ballot, Mr Clinton said he was a little sad but had come to accept it. \"I've had my time, and it was a good time,\" he said. \"I've loved it.\" </p> <p>He pledged to \"manage the transition well\" for whoever wins the election, but doesn't plan to go gently into being a \"lame-duck\" president.</p> <p>He said he would focus on pursuing peace in the Middle East and improving relations with North Korea. He said he would work on several legislative matters still pending before Congress - an agenda that would keep him busy until he leaves office on January 19 2001.</p> <p>\"Some people thought I was a lame duck in '95,\" Mr Clinton said. \"I'll just keep quacking. I've got another 10 weeks to quack.\" </p> <p>Mr Clinton told reporters he was basing his prediction of a Gore victory on the fact that many Americans are satisfied with the current economic prosperity and would want a steward who would stick closest to the strategy that built that success. </p> <p>\"There is a feeling in the country, that I pick up, that people want to keep the prosperity going. They want to keep moving in a good direction, and I think that rebounds to his favour,\" Mr Clinton said of Mr Gore. </p> <p>\"He's gone out there and made his case to the American people, laid out a program that's different and new, and ... I think he's got a chance to do real well.\" </p> <p>Of the election in general, he disputed assertions that his absence from the campaign trail has hurt Mr Gore. \"I think that's overrated,\" he said. </p> <p>\"The fact that I was out there hard this weekend, and that many of you reported ... the substance of what I was saying, it really didn't matter where I was.\"</p> <p><br><b>Related stories</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/comment/\">Comment: Liberals torn over Nader</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/columnists/\">Columnists: Missing Bill already</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,393871,00.html\">Election day</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/graphic/0,5543,393512,00.html\">Map</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,394030,00.html\">What the US papers say</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,393898,00.html\"> Explainer: How does America choose their next president?</a><br><a href=\"http://talk.guardianunlimited.co.uk/WebX?13@@.ee7931a\">Talk about it</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,376827,00.html\">Who would you vote for?</a><br><br><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.algore2000.com/\">Official site: Al Gore 2000</a><br><a href=\"  http://www.bush2000.com/\">Official site: George W Bush 2000</a><br><a href=\"  http://www.votenader.com/\">Official site: Ralph Nader 2000 <br></a><a href=\"http://www.fearthis.com/\">Site of the day - fearthis.com</a><br><a href=\"       http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,381260,00.html\">US election links</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hillary2000.org\"> Official site: Hilary Clinton 2000</a></p>",

  "The polling stations have opened on the east coast of the US for today's presidential election that is still too close to call after the tightest race in 40 years. <p>Exhausted by the effort, the candidates, Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W Bush, have now surrendered their fate to the voters. </p> <p>Mr Bush, the governor of Texas and son of former president George Bush, is topping most of the polls, but the outcome is uncertain.</p> <p>Mr Gore, who has been the US vice-president for eight years, put in a final push of campaigning in Florida, a key state to win.</p> <p>The earliest results are already in from the two New Hampshire towns where votes are traditionally first posted. </p> <p>In Dixville Notch, the result was Bush, 21, Gore 5, and the green candidate, Ralph Nader, 1. In nearby Hart's Location, it was Bush 17 and Gore 13, with one vote for a write-in candidate. </p> <p>\"It's not close here, but I believe it will be close in New Hampshire and across the country,\" said Stephen Barba, a Dixville Notch voter. </p> <p>Mr Bush will cast his ballot in Austin, Texas, and has been making calls to west coast radio stations to urge voters to turn out. He also was calling voters in Michigan, Oregon, Florida, Iowa and Wisconsin. </p> <p>After his pre-dawn campaigning in Florida, Mr Gore was voting in Carthage, Tennessee. </p> <p>Voters were choosing between Mr Bush's promise to be a \"uniter not a divider\" and Mr Gore's assertion that he alone has the experience to \"fight for you and win.\" A new Congress was also being decided at the polls. </p> <p>Before that election day ritual in New Hampshire, the candidates had barnstormed the country one last time. </p> <p>Mr Bush hit four states - Tennessee, Wisconsin, Iowa and Arkansas - that voted for Bill Clinton and Mr Gore in 1992 and 1996, but which polls suggest could go Republican. </p> <p>\"If people do what I think they're going to do, you're looking at the next president of the United States,\" the Texas governor told an audience of several hundred supporters after returning to Austin.</p> <p>For his part, Mr Gore engaged in a marathon 30-hour campaigning flurry through crucial Iowa, Missouri, Michigan and Florida. In Florida, he said that the crowd of tens of thousands who greeted him in Miami's fashionable South Beach left him with \"no doubt whatsoever\" he'd finish the day as president-elect. </p> <p>\"Americans are coming together and making a very powerful decision that we are not going to allow ourselves to go back to the policies of the past,\" Mr Gore told the crowd. \"We're going forward with the policies of the future - a bright future that includes all Americans.\" </p> <p>A cast of stars - Glenn Close, Robert De Niro, Stevie Wonder, Billy Dee Williams, Ben Affleck - were there to boost his final campaigning. </p> <p>From Miami, Mr Gore headed to a decidedly more sombre event, holding a pre-dawn meeting with nurses at a Tampa cancer centre, where he sat around a table and talked health care. </p> <p>Mr Gore also was rallying workers on their way to \"get out the vote\" before heading home to cast his own vote at a small school in Carthage. </p> <p>Behind Mr Gore and Mr Bush was the most expensive election in history - $3bn (\u00a32bn) on presidential and congressional races, about $30 for every vote cast - but one that failed to stir much excitement. </p> <p>President Bill Clinton predicted that Mr Gore will emerge victorious on the strength of the economy and a hoped-for large turnout among black people, Latin Americans, immigrants and the working poor. </p> <p>\"He's run a good campaign on his own,\" Mr Clinton said, before taking off from Washington bound for his new home in Chappaqua, New York, where he planned to vote. \"Especially the last couple of weeks, I think he's really been in gear and you also see a lot of our people getting energised. I think he'll win.\" </p> <p>In addition to replacing Mr Clinton, the people were deciding control of the house of representatives and senate, both narrowly held by Republicans. </p> <p>Voters were picking all 435 members of the House, 34 senators and 11 governors and members of state legislatures.</p> <p>For the first time in history, a president's wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, is seeking election to the Senate. She faced Republican Rick Lazio in New York, nominated when prostate cancer caused the mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, to abandon plans to run. </p> <p>With peace and prosperity both at hand and not big issues, the fight was chiefly over how to divide the spoils of prosperity. Mr Bush proposes tax cuts and Mr Gore favours shoring up federal pensions, health care and education.</p> <p><br><b>Related stories</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/comment/\">Comment: Liberals torn over Nader</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/columnists/\">Columnists: Missing Bill already</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,393871,00.html\"> Election day</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/graphic/0,5543,393512,00.html\">Map</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,393605,00.html\">What the US papers say</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,393898,00.html\"> Explained: How the US chooses its president</a><br><a href=\"  http://talk.guardianunlimited.co.uk/WebX?13@@.ee7931a\">Talk about it</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,376827,00.html\">Who would you vote for?</a><br><br><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.algore2000.com/\" target=\"_new\">Official site: Al Gore 2000</a><br><a href=\"http://www.bush2000.com/\" target=\"_new\">Official site: George W Bush 2000</a><br><a href=\"http://www.votenader.com/\" target=\"_new\">Official site: Ralph Nader 2000 <br></a><a href=\"http://www.fearthis.com/\" target=\"_new\">Site of the day - fearthis.com</a></p>",
  "There are two universal threads running through the mass of election coverage: the frantic, frenzied nature of the campaign's final 24 hours, and the utter impossibility of predicting the outcome. <p>As the campaign dust finally settles and Americans set about choosing their new leaders, some of the papers are casting around for entertaining sidebar stories.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/\" target=\"_new\">Los Angeles Times</a>, for example, is already looking ahead to how ex-president Clinton will be filling his time. Apparently he has no shortage of plans.</p> <p>\"... Clinton, while vowing not to tread on official toes - especially if his vice president, Democrat Al Gore, wins the presidency - is thinking on a scale that dwarfs [Jimmy] Carter, or even the elder statesman gambits of Richard Nixon.</p> <p>\"Clinton sounds like a man determined to raise more money, talk with more world leaders and generally plunge deeper into the public fray than any of his modern-day predecessors.</p> <p>\"From education and health care reform to bringing peace to Northern Ireland and the Middle East, Clinton envisions playing a high-profile role that will cheer his admirers and keep his enemies gnashing their teeth for years to come.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/\" target=\"_new\">Chicago Tribune</a> delves into its Illinois hinterland to come up with a delicious little piece about the neighbouring hamlets of Bush and Goreville:</p> <p>\"With town names like these, Bush (pop. 351) and Goreville (pop. 872), might have provided a photo opportunity along the presidential campaign trail for Texas Gov George W Bush and vice president Al Gore.</p> <p>\"Trouble is, the towns'loyalties don' live up to their names. There are precious few Gore supporters in Goreville, and even fewer Bush supporters in Bush.</p> <p>\"Of course, in Bush - where a weed-choked, long-abandoned high school recalls better days - there aren't many people to begin with.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/chronicle/\" target=\"_new\">San Francisco Chronicle</a>, which backs Gore, presents the closing hours of the campaign as a last-minute dash for the winning tape, with both candidates desperately seeking last minute momentum.</p> <p>\"The airwaves were a blizzard of campaign advertising, with an advantage to Bush. From the start of his run through mid-October, the Texas governor had spent $138 million, including $56 million on radio and TV ads, according to the Campaign Study Group.</p> <p>\"Gore was at $94 million overall, including $41.5 million for broadcast ads.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.herald.com/\" target=\"_new\">Miami Herald</a> looks at another modern campaigning tool: the pre-recorded telephone message.</p> <p>\"Tens of thousands of such messages, recorded by candidates and their celebrity supporters, have hit answering machines across the nation.</p> <p>\"Some voters, like Jason Cottrell, are unimpressed: 'If I got a call from a real person, I would talk to them,' said Cottrell, who also received recordings from gun control advocate Sarah Brady for Gore and former presidential candidate John McCain for Bush. 'But a message doesn't seem right. My answering machine is sort of personal'.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.wvgazette.com/\" target=\"_new\">Charleston Gazette</a>, in the 'swing' state of West Virginia, urges its readers to use their votes, and has no doubt where they should go: \"A vote for vice president Al Gore may actually make a real difference in this tight election.</p> <p>\"Gore will need every popular vote and every electoral vote he can win in his battle against Texas Gov George W Bush. A Gore victory would mean a lot for West Virginians.</p> <p>\"Gore will keep the nation headed on the right track, continuing the unprecedented prosperity the United States has enjoyed for the last eight years.\"</p> <p>The paper runs through its endorsements in the other elections, and finally exhorts: \"As soon as you finish reading this newspaper, go vote.

  "Britain rejected calls yesterday from the president of the European commission, Romano Prodi, to abandon its veto on key areas of tax and immigration policy in the interests of streamlining decision-making to cope with the planned enlargement of the EU. <p>Mr Prodi, in his first speech in Britain as head of the commission, said in Birmingham that the system would be unable to cope if the number of EU members expanded from 15 to as many as 28 in the next decade or so. </p> <p>Mr Prodi said that an extension of qualified majority voting - used only for non-contentious issues at present - would allow the government to push its own initiatives through the EU more easily. Britain had the choice, he said: play a leading part in Europe or be left lagging. </p> <p>But his suggestion that the veto should be abandoned for taxation matters relating to the single market, fraud, immigration and e-commerce, met with a frosty response. Keith Vaz, the minister for Europe, who welcomed most of Mr Prodi's conciliatory speech, said the government rejected scrapping of the veto in any tax matters and any interference with immigration policy. </p> <p>\"We have made it clear that on tax, social security, border controls and immigration we will not consider qualified majority voting or the removal of the veto.\" Many other countries, he said, also had areas where they considered scrapping the veto to be off-limits. </p> <p>With the Conservatives keen to make Europe a pivotal issue at the next election, ministers are taking a tough line on the veto in advance of December's EU summit in Nice, where the agenda will be headed by the issue of reforming the system through which power is exercised and decisions reached. </p> <p>Mr Vaz said Britain was prepared to talk about majority voting in certain limited fields, such as the rules governing the European court of justice. </p> <p>Mr Prodi said that enlargement could not be achieved without deep-seated reform of the commission and of the structures of the union itself. </p> <p>\"I hope that decision-taking will be made more efficient, by moving to majority voting in key areas - not in all areas; but in those which are essential to an enlarged union. </p> <p>\"I feel strongly that we must make it easier to modernise and simplify EU laws. I know that in Britain many believe majority voting will reduce Britain's ability to say 'no' to the things it doesn't want. But I have to remind you: it is majority voting that eases the path of initiatives that Britain does want. In an enlarged EU of 28 or more countries, it is simply not possible to continue operating under a system which was conceived for the founding six.\" </p> <p>Mr Vaz welcomed Mr Prodi's repetition of Tony Blair's observation in Warsaw in September that Europe should be a superpower but not a superstate. \"I am Italian. I was proud to be prime minister of my country. I will not give up my national identity. And no one is threatening that I should,\" Mr Prodi said. \"So let me say this loud and clear: this commission is not calling for a European superstate. Let's forget that fallacy once and for all. </p> <p>\"We have become, and we will remain, interdependent. Europe wants the UK to play its rightful role in the union: a leading role. But the choice is yours ... a leading role, or a country left lagging behind.\" </p> <p>With Europe's single currency flagging, Mr Prodi studiously avoided mentioning possible British entry into the monetary system, though in this area, too, he argued at a later press conference that as a more active member of the club Britain would count more.</p>",
  "Al Gore was closing the gap on George W Bush as Americans prepared to go to the polls today to elect a successor to Bill Clinton in one of the closest-fought presidential election campaigns in US history. <p>The final daily tracking polls of the campaign showed Mr Gore, the Democrat, narrowing the long-standing lead of his Republican rival to well within the statistical margin of error.</p> <p>One poll even gave Mr Gore a 2% lead on the back of a strong 48 hours of polling.</p> <p>In the final Gallup tracking survey of the campaign, Mr Bush led by 47% to Mr Gore's 45%, compared with a 48%-43% lead at the weekend. In the final Zogby International tracking poll, Mr Bush led by just one point, 47% to 46%. A late tracking poll by Reuters/MSNBC put Mr Gore in the lead at 48% to 46%.</p> <p>Further evidence of a neck- and-neck finish came last night in a Harris poll based on an unusually large sample, which showed Mr Bush leading 47%-46% in the popular vote, but projected Mr Gore as the next president by virtue of a 286-241 victory in the electoral college, with Washington state's 11 votes too close to call.</p> <p>The Harris poll was based on a sample of 134,000 people and was carried out between October 30 and November 4.</p> <p>It also supported the opinion of some experts that Mr Gore might become the first man since 1888 to be elected president without winning a majority of the popular vote.</p> <p>Oozing confidence, Mr Bush took his campaign deep into opposition territory on the last full day on the stump, campaigning in Mr Clinton's Arkansas and Mr Gore's Tennessee before returning to his home in Austin, Texas.</p> <p>\"We've laid the groundwork for victory. Now it's up to us to get people to the polls,\" Mr Bush told supporters in Orlando, Florida yesterday.</p> <p>Mr Gore campaigned in the key states of Iowa, Missouri, Michigan and Florida, all of which he needs to win if he is to fulfil his dream of succeeding Mr Clinton.</p> <p>\"You are the ones who are going to make the difference in this race,\" Mr Gore told Iowa campaign workers in a pre-dawn briefing. \"That's what's going to win this race.\"</p> <p>A new Gallup poll of independent voters showed a sharp swing from Mr Nader to Mr Gore. Last week, 41% of independent voters said they were backing Mr Bush, 36% Mr Gore and 13% Mr Nader. This week, Mr Gore is on 40% and Mr Nader is on 9%, with Mr Bush unchanged.</p> <p>The crucial black vote is also hardening up for Mr Gore in the final hours, polls said. Mr Gore's support among African American voters has risen from 86% last week to 91% on the eve of poll.</p> <p>\"It's one of many hopeful signs,\" said a member of Gore's team in Nashville yesterday. \"It is expected. It's traditional that third-party support slips at the end of a campaign and the base comes back.\"</p> <p>Mr Bush's camp was just as confident, releasing private poll results which they claimed showed the Republican ahead in Florida and Michigan and neck-and-neck in California.</p> <p>As well as a president, a new House of Representatives was being elected today by American voters, along with 34 members of the US Senate. The first projected results, based on exit polls, will come through after 11pm GMT.</p> <p><br><b>Related stories</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/comment/\">Comment: Liberals torn over Nader</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/columnists/\">Columnists: Missing Bill already</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,393871,00.html\">Election day</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/graphic/0,5543,393512,00.html\">Map</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,393605,00.html\">What the US papers say</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,393898,00.html\"> Explainer: How does America choose their next president?</a><br><a href=\"http://talk.guardianunlimited.co.uk/WebX?13@@.ee7931a\">Talk about it</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,376827,00.html\">Who would you vote for?</a><br><br><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.algore2000.com/\">Official site: Al Gore 2000</a><br><a href=\"  http://www.bush2000.com/\">Official site: George W Bush 2000</a><br><a href=\"  http://www.votenader.com/\">Official site: Ralph Nader 2000 <br></a><a href=\"http://www.fearthis.com/\">Site of the day - fearthis.com</a><br><a href=\"       http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,381260,00.html\">US election links</a></p>",
  "<p>It was a telling moment at yesterday's annual meeting of Britain's bosses in Birmingham, when a leading Tory politician was slapped down by Digby Jones, the CBI director-general, as he denounced the network of government-sponsored regional development agencies. </p> <p>The politician in question was the shadow environment spokesman Archie Norman. Once leading Tories were received with fawning deference and Labour spokesmen were not even allowed through the door. Not any more. </p> <p>The CBI has just released its scrupulously even-handed business election manifesto. It is clear that its differences with Labour are skin-deep while those with the opposition are more fundamental. </p> <p>Mr Jones, a west Midlands lawyer, replaced Adair Turner with a firm mandate to put more distance between the CBI and Labour. </p> <p>To an extent this has happened, underlined by the organisation's campaign against government red tape and regulations, which it says have cost firms more than \u00a312bn since May 1997, when Labour came to power. But Mr Jones and his team have no objection to the government's policies on the national minimum wage, shorter working hours or longer holidays. They also admit that the lion's share of the \u00a312.3bn cost is accounted for by the value of the policies themselves. </p> <p>The attack on red tape is partly a bargaining tool designed to dissuade ministers from bringing in new workplace rights such as paid parental leave. The CBI now goes out of its way to applaud Labour's achievements in office. Sir Iain Vallance, BT chairman and the CBI's new president, praised Gordon Brown on Sunday for his stewardship of the economy, particularly for creating and sustaining macro-economic stability after the boom-bust years of successive Tory chancellors. The strength of sterling remains a problem for the CBI's manufacturing wing but the body will not call for government intervention to force a devaluation. </p> <p>Britain's leading employers' body also salutes government investment in education, especially in raising the nation's skills base and tackling chronic British problems of adult illiteracy and innumeracy. Under Mr Jones the CBI sees itself as critical to persuading deputy prime minister John Prescott to adopt a \u00a3180bn spending programme for transport over the next 10 years. </p> <p>The differences with the Tories are glaring. Mr Jones has demanded assurances from Michael Portillo, shadow chancellor, that his proposed spending plans - with cuts of \u00a38bn to \u00a316bn in Mr Brown's own plans - will not affect the transport improvement programme. </p> <p>The chief source of conflict between the CBI and the opposition is the euro. The CBI is as divided over the issue as the nation, although it remains wedded to the idea of joining in principle. It simply disagrees with the opposition's decision to rule out joining for virtually the whole of this decade, and this message has been delivered privately to William Hague and Mr Portillo repeatedly. \"Why tie your hands behind your back?\" Mr Jones said. \"You should have the flexibility to deal with the set of cards given to you. They are mistaken in categorically closing down that option.\" </p> <p>In the run up to next year's likely general election the CBI is bound to raise demands for fewer taxes and less regulation, key elements of the Tories' agenda. But without publicly endorsing Labour, the bulk of its senior officials and its members will be praying - and voting - for a second term for Tony Blair.</p>",

  "Al Gore, vice-president since 1993, was born to high office. \"We trained him for it\", his father, also Al Gore and a leading Democrat senator, once said. <p>Educated with the nation's elite in Washington - but brought up outside term-time on the family's farm in Carthage, Tennessee - Gore went to Harvard university at a time when student life was in the throes of '60s counter-culture and protests against the Vietnam war. Unlike Bill Clinton, he did inhale.</p> <p>He also volunteered for the draft to Vietnam in 1970, although both he and his father opposed the war. In south-east Asia, he served as a journalist - though rarely under fire, as rivals have pointed out. </p> <p>On his return he worked as a journalist before standing for - and winning - a seat in the House of Representatives. He made a name as a defender of consumer rights and as something of a moral conservative. He voted against allowing abortion and spoke critically about homosexuality.</p> <p>In 1984 he stepped up his career, entering the senate as one of Tennessee's two representatives. He became fascinated by a string of issues then outside the mainstream, including the environment and information technology.</p> <p>After an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988, he wrote a best-selling book on environmentalism, Earth in the Balance. The book helped make his name - but also trapped him in the public mind as a politician obsessed with detail, and opposed to much that ordinary Americans hold dear - not least, cheap petrol.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Bill Clinton chose him as his running mate in 1992 and Al Gore was sworn in as vice-president a year later. He has had a big stake in the Clinton presidency, with greater access to power than most of his predecessors. </p> <p>That has brought advantages - but also damaged Gore's reputation, not least his refusal to condemn Bill Clinton after the Lewinsky affair. </p> <p>He also became involved in a scandal over fundraising ahead of Bill Clinton's re-election in 1996: rumours about what exactly went on have never gone away. </p> <p>Politically, Al Gore was a liberal reformer, campaigning against big government and supporting Bill Clinton in his decision to support Republican plans to cut taxes.</p> <p>That upset some traditional Democrats, many of whom backed Bill Bradley for the presidential nomination in primary races earlier this year. Gore won though - and has been neck and neck in the polls with his rival George Bush ever since. </p> <p>Even if he wins, the US will not love him as it has Bill Clinton. Republicans have made hay with Gore's leaden public character, and his boastful claims to have helped \"invent\" the internet.</p> <p> In office, he would have to learn how to speak to the nation in a way it can understand and trust.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.politics1.com/p2000.htm\" target=\"_new\">Full list of candidates standing for president</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.AlGore2000.com/\" target=\"_new\">Gore 2000: official site</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/EOP/OVP/VP.html\" target=\"_new\">Vice-president Al Gore: White House site</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.publicintegrity.org/reports/bop2000/gore_index.htm\" target=\"_new\">The buying of the president 2000: Al Gore</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.democrats.org/index.html\" target=\"_new\">Democratic national committee</a><br><a href=\"http://slate.msn.com/Features/goresr/goresr.asp\" target=\"_new\">Was Albert Gore sr. a crook?

  "George W Bush is a political blue-blood. Like his Democratic rival Al Gore, his father was a successful politician - and, also like Al Gore, he shares his father's name. <p>But even more than Gore, Bush's candidature suggests that the US is not quite the land of open-for-all opportunity people think it is. </p> <p>If George Bush is elected to the White House, it will have as much to do with his father's reputation and fund-raising powers as it will with Bush's own character.</p> <p>Nonetheless, he is typical of his generation and his country. A Spanish-speaking millionaire who has moved with the nation from his east coast roots to the booming south-west - in his case, Texas - he grew up more involved in baseball than in anything else. </p> <p>He studied at Yale, where he was noted more for his personality than for his academic skills. After a spell in the Texas National Guard (which earned him exemption from serving in Vietnam) he spent the early 1970s apparently lost. He partied, drank and - though the details are unclear - took drugs. In 1976, he was convicted of drink driving.</p> <p>After a failed bid for a seat in Congress, Bush made - and lost - money in the oil business as his father became first vice-president and then president. He married and his wife, Laura, helped him put his unsettled past behind him.</p> <p>In 1994, after his father's defeat by Bill Clinton, he beat the Democratic governor of Texas, Ann Richards, in a tough fight. Bush took notably conservative positions - on homosexuality, the death penalty and youth crime.</p> <p>In office, he stuck to them - although he worked with Democrats on his only real political passion, education. By keeping his election promises, Bush was re-elected in 1998 with 68% of the vote.</p> <p>That success made him a natural front-runner for the Republican nomination. He won it by portraying himself as a \"compassionate conservative\" - able to work across party lines and take tough decisions on social issues.</p> <p>Critics pointed to his record on the death penalty (150 people have been executed in Texas during his time as governor, one a fortnight) and on pollution. </p> <p>No issue caused more controversy than his decision to allow the execution of Karla Faye Tucker. Convicted of a double-murder, she appealed for clemency on national television. After what he described as one of the hardest decisions he had ever had to take, Bush allowed her to die.</p> <p>Early this year, he beat a strong challenge from the reformist Republican John McCain in the primary vote to decide the Republican candidate, and built a lead over Al Gore which, though wavering, has endured to the eve of polling day. </p> <p>Critics have pointed to his lightweight past, and his verbal slips. Even supporters admit that he is not a man for detail, but say he is a good delegator. That is one strength.

Most states allow voters to register to vote until 10 days or so before polling day and in recent years, the process has been simplified. Americans can apply to register online and even when they renew driving licences. <p><b>How does polling day work? </b><br> Again, the rules vary from state to state: but almost everywhere, voting is a different experience from the same process in Britain. For a start, only 1.7% of voters use British-style ballot papers. Traditionally, Americans vote using mechanical levers (a bit like adding up on an old-style cash register). About a fifth of US votes are still cast this way, but computer technology is taking over. Whichever system is used, the votes are counted quickly. Since polling stations close early in the evening, the result is often declared surprisingly early. Adding to the complexity, though, are America's multiple time zones. Exit polls from some eastern states are available before voters have finished choosing candidates in the west. This can have a big impact on the result. </p> <p><b>What happens once the polls have closed? </b><br> The votes are counted and results declared state by state. Most international attention will be on the presidential race, but Americans will also vote on a huge range of other jobs, including some state governors, senators, members of the House of Representatives and local officials such as police chiefs. In some states voters also take part in referenda on contentious local issues. </p> <p><b>But how does the presidential vote work?</b><br> American presidents are not elected directly but through an electoral college. In 48 of the 50 states, the candidate who finishes top collects all of that state's votes in the \"electoral college\" (in the two oddballs, Maine and Nebraska, the candidate who comes second is given one of the college votes as well).</p> <p><b>How is the electoral college organised? </b><br> The college has 538 seats. A candidate needs 270 electoral college votes to win. Roughly, college votes are allocated to states by population. As the largest state, California has 54 votes in the electoral college. New York is second with 33. Seven sparsely populated states, plus the District of Columbia, have three votes each, the minimum allowed. </p> <p><b>Which states will decide the election? </b><br> Mr Gore's hopes now rest absolutely on a victory in Florida, a state with 25 electoral college votes. At one time it seemed likely to go to Mr Bush, but as things have turned out, Mr Gore has been in the lead there in most opinion polls this autumn. </p> <p>The other fiercely fought state is Pennsylvania (23 votes), where the polls now put Mr Gore ahead. He also needs to win in Michigan (18 votes), where the race has been neck-and-neck and the survey results contradictory, and in Wisconsin (11 votes). And he must squeeze Ralph Nader's Green support to take Minnesota (10), Oregon (7) and Washington state (11). </p> <p>The most recent electoral college survey by Reuters showed Mr Gore lagging, with 196 votes solid or leaning his way, against Mr Bush's 209. This leaves 133 in states that are too close to call. </p> <p><b>Could there be an upset?</b><br> Al Gore's Democratic camp hopes to upset the odds by winning the electoral college votes of the handful of key states that are too close to predict. Therefore, Mr Gore may become president even though more people nationwide voted for the Republican Mr Bush. </p> <p>If that were to happen - a Gore win in the electoral college despite a Bush victory in the popular vote - it will be the third time in US electoral history. In 1876, Rutherford Hayes defeated Samuel Tilden this way, and Benjamin Harrison pipped Grover Cleveland in 1888.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/pages/faqs.htm\" target=\"_new\">Federal Election Commission: questions </a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.algore2000.com/\" target=\"_new\">Al Gore 2000</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.bush2000.com/\" target=\"_new\">George Bush 2000</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,393605,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Race too close to call</a><br></p>",
  "It was confirmed last night that Al Gore could be elected president of the United States in today's election, even though more Americans will vote for George W Bush. <p>Such a result, unprecedented in the universal suffrage era, has only been the stuff of fiction and constitutional nerds until now. But yesterday's Harris Interactive Election 2000 poll shows that it could now become fact, not fiction. </p> <p>According to the poll, Mr Bush leads Mr Gore in the national popular vote by 47% to 46%, with Green candidate Ralph Nader on 4% and the Reform party's Pat Buchanan 1%. </p> <p>But Mr Gore leads Mr Bush in the electoral college, the same poll suggests, with a winning total of 286 votes to 241. Washington state's 11 votes are not allocated because the two candidates are dead level there. </p> <p>Such an outcome would make Mr Gore the next president of the United States, in succession to Bill Clinton. Mr Gore would be the first president since Benjamin Harrison in 1888 to be elected president in spite of receiving fewer votes than his opponent.</p> <p>Such a result has never occurred since women and black Americans got the vote and would be certain to trigger talk of a court challenge by dismayed Republicans if it occurs. </p> <p>Other polls have put the two candidates neck and neck in the popular vote. And other surveys have suggested that Mr Gore could take the presidency in the electoral college even though Mr Bush beats him in the popular vote. </p> <p>But what is special about the Harris Interactive survey is that it combines the two findings in a single huge state-by-state survey of American opinion, with a sufficiently large sample to take the possibility out of the realm of fantasy and place it in the realm of reality. </p> <p>Harris's survey contacted an unprecedentedly large sample of 134,000 likely voters online in 50 states between October 30 and November 4 before weighting their replies by age, sex, education, race, urban or rural home and propensity to be online. </p> <p>Most of the state samples are sufficiently large for their results to be much more statistically reliable than most other polls. The sample in the largest state, California, was 14,632 while that from Alaska was 591. </p> <p>The new poll shows Mr Gore winning in the following closely contested states: California, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, Hew Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. </p> <p>It puts Mr Bush ahead in Arizona, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee and West Virginia. In addition, Washington is tied at 46%-46%.</p> <p>The results are within the margin of error in several cases, but the overall picture is of Mr Gore winning in most of fiercely fought states where the candidates have concentrated their campaign appearances in the final days of the campaign. </p> <p>Mr Nader is clearly cutting into Mr Gore's vote in several states, such as Wisconsin, Oregon, New Mexico, Ohio, West Virginia and California. The survey finds that the Nader effect could tip the balance against Mr Gore in Ohio, West Virginia and Washington. </p> <p>The survey also looks in detail at several of the statewide US senate races. It suggests that two tight races - in Florida and Michigan - are tipping to the Democrats by narrow margins, and two more - Virginia and Washington - to the Republicans. </p> <p>The Missouri race between John Ashcroft (Republican) and the late Mel Carnahan (Democrat) is a tie at present. </p> <p>In other important races, Democrats Jon Corzine and Hillary Clinton lead easily in New Jersey and New York respectively, while Democrat Mark Dayton is on course to oust Republican Rod Grams in Minnesota. However, John Ensign leads comfortably for the Republicans in Nevada.</p> <p><b>Audio</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/1102kettle.ra\">Martin Kettle: 'Lots of American flags being flown'</a></p> <p><b>Related stories</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,393867,00.html\">7 November 2000: Gore closes the gap</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,393869,00.html\">7 November 2000: The fight for the ear of the voter</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,393856,00.html\">7 November 2000: Jonathan Freedland says goodbye to Bill Clinton</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.harrisinteractive.com/\" target=\"_new\">Harris Interactive</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.AlGore2000.com/\" target=\"_new\">Al Gore's website</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.georgewbush.com/\" target=\"_new\">George W Bush's website</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.votenader.com/\" target=\"_new\">Ralph Nader's website</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.buchananreform.com/\" target=\"_new\">Pat Buchanan's website</a></p>",
  "In Brooklyn's Crown Heights, Sandra Brathwaite stands at the top of her block and delivers an ethnic inventory. \"That side is all Jewish,\" she says, pointing to the right. \"And this side is black... well a mix of African-American and Caribbean really. But the Jews have started moving over.\" As she continues down Eastern Parkway, her vocal audit keeps pace with her stride. \"This house is black, that house is black, that one is Jewish, the next three are black, the one after that is Jewish... I could go on.\" <p>On one side of the street, the African-American flag flies from the black firefighters hall; on the other, inscriptions on an ambulance and posters on lamp-posts are in Yiddish. Geographically close yet culturally distant, politically united yet mutually antagonistic, once economically interdependent, now socially stratified - the story of the relationship between African-Americans and Jews is long and complex. It is a narrative stretching back through the last century and beyond, which has veered from the inspiring to the horrific. They were once great allies during the civil rights era and within the Democratic party, but more recently have been bitter and sometimes bloody foes. </p> <p>But now black-Jewish relations seem to be entering a more optimistic, if uncertain phase. The nomination of Joseph Lieberman, a Jewish senator from Connecticut, as running mate to the Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore, has proved an unlikely catalyst for a desire on both sides for greater understanding, if not reconciliation. Lieberman's nomination received the warm endorsement of the Reverend Jesse Jackson - once reviled in the Jewish community for referring to New York as \"Heimie town\". Lieberman in turn has extended an olive branch to the leader of the Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan - the man who branded Judaism \"a gutter religion\" and called Hitler \"a great man\". Farrakhan looks as though he may accept. \"I would welcome a meeting... it could be a bridge between the black community and the Jewish community,\" he said. </p> <p>There has been as much pragmatism in this as principle. African-Americans are the most loyal constituency the Democrats have. Since the second world war the Democratic party has only once won the presidency - with Lyndon Johnson in 1964 - with a majority of the white vote. One of Lieberman's first visits after being officially nominated this summer was to the Congressional black caucus. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Farrakhan's church is struggling to overcome high-level defections, following accusations of adultery and federal lawsuits alleging sexual harassment. Farrakhan, who is suffering from prostate cancer, is in search of a meaningful legacy. His attempt to cement one earlier this month through the Million Family March failed, thanks to a poor turnout. Reinventing himself as a religious and racial healer rather than an anti-semitic firebreather may be his last hope. </p> <p>Embarking on this new route has not been without its obstacles on both sides. Explaining the rationale behind Lieberman's selection, Harlem's black newspaper, the Amsterdam News, wrote in an editorial: \"The reasoning in the Gore camp went out all over the world to Jews of means: 'You've got to show me the money.' The word went out... that the major protector of Jews in this world, the American government, is now available.\" Meanwhile, two major Jewish lobbying organisations, the Anti-Defamation League and the Republican Jewish Coalition, urged Lieberman to stay away from Farrakhan. </p> <p>One reason for this climate of mistrust and antagonism is economic. Pogroms and poverty sent a large number of Jews to America from eastern Europe at the beginning of the last century; roughly the same time that racism and poverty delivered African-Americans from the south to the north. As is the case in Crown Heights today, they often lived cheek by jowl. With access to mortgages, loans or a decent education denied to most African-Americans and granted to Jews - because they were white - an unequal economic relationship soon developed. </p> <p>James Baldwin, in his essay The Harlem Ghetto, wrote of Jews, particularly Jewish landlords, \"They operate in accordance with the American business tradition of exploiting negroes and they are therefore identified with oppression and are hated for it.\" In short, the standard tension between landlords and tenants or employers and employees took on an ethnic dimension. As Jews advanced economically and moved out of black areas, this particular relationship died, but the prejudice continued. </p> <p>This is reflected in polling data. \"There are certain stereotypes that black Americans are more likely to believe about Jews than white Americans,\" says Tom Smith, a social scientist at the university of Chicago. \"Namely, that Jews are 'unscrupulous in business' and 'mean about money'. In all other aspects they are no more negative than white Americans.\" </p> <p>Nor, some are keen to point out, does the fact that both groups endure discrimination mean that they cannot also inflict it. Jews are still white, and African-Americans are still gentiles; the former can still be racist; the latter can still be anti-semitic. Nowhere was this clearer than in Crown Heights almost 10 years ago, after a Hasidic driver ran over a seven-year-old African American boy and was then attacked by a mob. A Hasidic ambulance arrived first and took care of the driver while the boy and his injured cousin had to wait for a city ambulance. The boy died. Hours later black youths killed a rabbinical student in revenge. Riots ensued. </p> <p>Add an organisation like the Nation of Islam to the mix, says David Bositis, a senior political analyst at the joint centre for political and economic studies in Washington, and the possible points of conflict grow. \"Muslims and Jewish people are at odds. Jews are basically white and the NOI's creed is that the devil created white people. On those grounds alone you wouldn't expect them to get on.\" </p> <p>Bositis believes that to concentrate on Farrakhan's anti-semitism is to misunderstand both his function and his importance. \"He's said a lot of things that are anti-semitic, but the question is, does it represent anything significant about black politics? The answer is no. It may be central to his message but not to his meaning.\" </p> <p>None of this makes solidarity between Jews and African-Americans impossible. Far from it. Jews were overrepresented in the struggle for civil rights, partly because they had a keen sense of what it meant to be denied rights. There was an element of self-preservation in it too: the principal target for southern bigotry was blacks, but Jews were not far behind. When legislation came to remove many of the legal barriers to equality, Jews would benefit too. </p> <p>Because Jews have experienced discrimination first hand, Bositis says, \"On balance they are less racist than the typical white person.\" It is facile to trade off the two groups' completely different experiences of oppression, as though the Holocaust and slavery were two chips in a poker game of victimisation. This not only belittles the suffering but insults the sufferer. In 1926, Louis Marshall, a Jewish jurist and supporter of black rights, addressed the convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People with tales of massacres of Jews in Europe. \"We were subject to indignities in comparison with which to sit in a Jim Crow car is to occupy a palace,\" he said to a stunned and angry audience. </p> <p>Never were these differences more apparent than in the post-civil rights era of Black Power. \"Black people felt they had to assert control of the movement, and there wasn't much room for any whites, including Jewish people, in that,\" says Smith. </p> <p> The two groups became estranged by class as well as race and religion. Jews, as a community, got wealthier, while blacks, on the whole, remained at the bottom of the pile. \"There are class differences as you would understand them in Europe,\" says Smith, \"in terms of whole culture, education, expectations, rather than just money.\" </p> <p>This created tensions that have been most evident around affirmative action - a matter of great importance to African-Americans. Smith says, \"Jews are more likely to believe that affirmative action might exacerbate differences than assuage them.\" </p> <p>Some say this is because before the war many universities established quotas to restrict Jewish entrants. The quotas were removed, thanks to the struggle for civil rights, but because Jews fought against them on principle then, many still oppose them now. As the commentator Jerome Chanes says: \"For Jews, quotas were a way of keeping people out; for African-Americans, quotas were a way of letting people in.\" </p> <p>Either way, Lieberman's selection was not a subject for intellectual debate but a matter of urgent political significance. He headed straight for the Congressional black caucus because he had made remarks supporting a Californian proposition to outlaw affirmative action in all state programmes. Moreover, for four years he had been chairman of the Democratic leadership council, representing rightwing Democrats, which often found itself in opposition to liberals such as Jesse Jackson. It was vital that Lieberman kept African-Americans on board. </p> <p>\"He said it is one thing to be the leader of a faction, but another to represent the whole organisation,\" says Ron Walker at the University of Maryland. \"He did convince people that whatever he might have said, he had an impressive voting record on these matters.\" </p> <p>Whether this new era of cooperation, if not friendship, will last after the election has yet to be seen. Voltaire said: \"One regards the Jews the same way as one regards the negroes, as a species of inferior humanity.\" Having faced the common enemy of intolerance, there is hope, in some quarters at least, that they may once again find common cause.</p>",
  "Not content with shattering all known spending records at every stage of the 2000 election, America's political parties will today blow another $100m (\u00a369m) on a final orgy of spending to get voters to the polls. <p>With the national opinion polls suggesting a last-minute tightening in the race between Al Gore and George W Bush, and an unusually large number of swing states still considered up for grabs, everything now comes down to which candidate has the superior organisation in the desperate contest for the White House. </p> <p>In a race in which less than half of the eligible electorate is likely to vote today, the winner will be the man who can do what the professionals call mobilising the base - a contest in which polls suggest Republicans are generally more likely to turn out than Democrats. </p> <p>In big battleground states like Florida, Michigan and Pennsylvania, voters are being bombarded with leaflets, telephone calls, emails and old-fashioned knocks on the door. </p> <p>The stakes could hardly be higher or more evenly balanced. The final national polls yesterday continued to show Mr Bush in the lead, but Mr Gore was apparently closing the gap in the final hours, leaving most of the poll findings within the margin of error. </p> <p>The final Gallup daily tracking poll showed Mr Bush leading 47% to 45%, while the Zogby International daily tracking poll had the race even closer, with Mr Bush ahead 47% to 46%. </p> <p>A new poll of likely voters by the Pew Research Centre showed Mr Bush leading 49% to 47%, with the Green Party candidate Ralph Nader on 4%. </p> <p>The tightness of the race ensured that the contest will be decided in the battleground states of the north-west and midwest, as well as Florida, where Mr Gore was due to end his final day of campaigning last night. </p> <p>Mr Bush showed his confidence by choosing to make two of his final four state visits of the campaign in Bill Clinton's Arkansas and in Mr Gore's Tennessee. </p> <p><b> Phone campaigning</b><br> A series of tracking polls by Zogby International in nine of the swing states gave encouragement to both sides, with Mr Bush leading in Ohio, Missouri, Wisconsin and Mr Gore's home state of Tennessee, while Mr Gore had the lead in Florida, Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Washington. Many of the state findings were inside the margin of error. </p> <p>The biggest development this year has been the proliferation of different new technologies in the \"get out the vote\" effort. The internet is at the heart of both parties' organisational efforts, but the main way to reach voters on polling day remains the telephone. </p> <p>Americans are already well accustomed to tele-marketing by commercial organisations, but cheaper telephone calls, higher campaign fundraising and the shrinking of the numbers of voters prepared to turn out have combined to make the telephone appeal the most effective of all last-minute campaign weapons for both parties. </p> <p>Automated calls from celebrities and leading politicians will begin going out from the early hours this morning, and will continue right up to the close of the polls. </p> <p>President Clinton may not have been very visible on the campaign trail this year, but his phone calls were going into tens of thousands of households yesterday and today, urging a vote for Mr Gore. Younger women voters in swing states can expect to calls from television star Sarah Jessica Parker, who is fronting a huge phone effort by abortion rights groups. </p> <p>On the Republican side, General Nor man Schwarzkopf can be heard in Michigan, Missouri and Florida urging a vote for Mr Bush, while well-resourced lobby groups like the National Rifle Association are backing Mr Bush with their own phone efforts in states like Pennsylvania with calls from the association president Charlton Heston. </p> <p>It is in the telephone call war that both sides and their allies are most likely to resort to the negative campaigning and scare tactics that have mostly been absent from the more public phases of this year's campaigns, such as speeches and even television advertising. </p> <p>In Michigan, some black American voters have complained that they have been receiving calls purporting to come from the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People advocating a vote for Mr Bush in the presidential contest. The NAACP is spending $10.5m supporting Mr Gore and the Democrats. </p> <p>In the New York senate race, the Republican Party admits that it has financed more than 50,000 calls including some which link Hillary Clinton, Yasser Arafat and the bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen last month and another targeted at Jewish voters which says Mrs Clinton supports the creation of a Palestinian state. </p> <p>\"In the last week, the Marquis of Queensbury rules seem to go out the window,\" says Congressman Tom Davis of Virginia, chairman of the Republican con gressional election campaign. \"Everyone seems to take off the gloves and put on the brass knuckles.\" </p> <p>Party campaigners' tasks have been made even more difficult this time round by the huge growth in postal voting - known here as absentee balloting - and by innovations such as Oregon's decision to abolish all polling stations in favour of votes by mail. Election officials have reported that the demand for absentee ballots has been at an all-time high in key states such as Florida, Illinois and Michigan. </p> <p>States like North Carolina and Mr Bush's Texas allow early voting in person - former president George Bush and his wife Barbara were among those who took advantage of the system last week - making it even harder for party organisations to keep track of who has voted and who has not. </p> <p>In the end, though, the difference between victory and defeat tonight may all come down to shoe leather and person-to-person contacts, as party workers knock on the doors of those who have yet to cast their votes.</p>",

  "On David Letterman's late show last Sunday, Madonna showed her take on American politics by revealing why her choice for the next president of the United States is Al Gore. \"I'm a chick, so who [else] would I vote for?\" <p>Madonna's method for selecting candidates is increasingly the only viable option for a certain social group of undecided Americans whose interest in politics begins and ends with Bill Clinton's indiscretions. For the floating voters who wouldn't know a healthcare reform if it bit them on the bum, making value judgments on the basis of appearance is a reality. </p> <p>But it's not simply a lack of interest in politics that has driven people to rely on looks. Imagine being a floating voter in America. How would you possibly choose between Gore - strong leadership skills but a real bastard; or Bush - man of the people, though apparently one sandwich short of a picnic. Strong and mean or sweet and stupid. </p> <p>You'd turn to policies, right? You'd think: \"Ah, social security - this interests me, directly affects me and will decide my vote for me.\" But with each policy comes a barrage of derision from the opposite party. As each candidate undermines the other, how can the average American make head or tail of the differences? </p> <p>These floating voters have learned not to expect a straight answer - and wouldn't know it if they got one anyway. They are disillusioned by spin and dirty tricks and are being forced to rely on something else to help them choose. Forget policies, forget personality, or rhetoric or celeb endorsement, the race for the presidency could well be won by \"he-whose-face-fits\". </p> <p>Looked at dispassionately, appearance is possibly the dumbest reason to elect a politician. Cognitive science though, has proved otherwise. Unlikely as it may sound, significant scientific research has shown that certain facial configurations are subconsciously judged to be more honest and trustworthy than others - and these are the two traits which rank first among those that Americans want to see in their next president. </p> <p>But it is not necessarily hunky good looks that give us a trustworthy character. In fact the reverse is true. David Perrett, professor of cognitive psychology at the University of St Andrews, has discovered that the more feminised the features, the more likely it will be that we trust the person. In men, voluptuous mouths, soft round chins and big eyes are said to be signs of trustworthiness. Thin lips, big chins and narrow eyes work in the opposite way. So while Gore would \"score\" well with the \"chicks\", if it is votes he's after, he may be less fortunate. With a high forehead, heavy jaw, thick brows, narrow eyes and strong cheekbones, according to Perrett's findings Gore would be judged as domineering, uncaring and aggressive. About the only thing he has going for him is a full mouth. </p> <p>Bush fares a little better. Although his eyes are very narrow and close set, his softer jaw-line, lower forehead and again, full lips, are signs of honesty, responsibility and truthfulness which, if cognitive psychology is correct, should give him more pulling power. </p> <p>So on scientific grounds, Bush looks more reliable. He is everyone's friend, Mr Potatohead, to Gore's all-action Buzz Lightyear with useless flashing lights and popout wings. Trouble is, the research relies on looks alone - and as soon as they open their mouths they blow it. </p> <p>Americans are certainly ready for an ingenuous, reliable government, but after the spats and smears of recent weeks, they look unlikely to get it. As \"big presidential personality fatigue\" sets in, the overriding impression is that the American politicians will do anything, and say anything to get the vote. And once the new president is in place he will also not be accountable to anyone, least of all the average American. </p> <p>So for the truly disillusioned floating voter, Madonna is right - Gore is the best bet. He's as unbelievable, unreliable and dishonest as the next politician, but at least he's sexy (well, sexier than the other one). He will be all over the TV and here's betting he'll give great soundbites. But only with the volume turned down.</p> <p>\u0095 Charlotte Raven is away until January.</p>",
  "The world's most powerful capital is today holding its breath, waiting to discover who its new tenants will be. If Al Gore pulls off a miracle it will presumably be business as usual - more or less the same breed of earnest young Democrats that has been filling the Starbucks branches on Pennsylvania Avenue for the past eight years. <p>If George W Bush triumphs, however, Washington will have to brace itself for a cultural tidal wave rolling in from Texas. If elected, the governor from Austin would inevitably bring a new crowd of advisers, wonks, gurus and hangers-on from the governor's mansion in Austin. </p> <p>There will be many immediate changes. Overnight, cowboy boots will become de rigueur with business suits, and the Texas twang (in both its authentic and ersatz varieties) will reverberate around the cafes of Georgetown. </p> <p>But beneath the froth, there will be another, more profound, cultural transformation at the epicentre of the world's sole superpower. Gore has the reputation of making key decisions on his own. To know him is to know who is going to be behind the wheel. </p> <p>Bush is an entirely different kind of operator. He keeps normal business hours, and expects his team to agree on a policy decision and present it to him in digestible form, rather like Ronald Reagan. So, as with Reagan, the identity of those advisers will take on a particular significance for the US and the world should America swing right today. </p> <p>They are, to say the least, a pretty interesting bunch - a different tribe entirely from the slick, pragmatic New Democrats in power at the moment. They have more in common with the Reaganauts than the subsequent court run by Bush the Elder. </p> <p>Bush's key economic adviser is Larry Lindsey, an early adherent from the Reagan era of supply-side economics. The doctrine (famously derided as \"voodoo economics\" by the governor's dad), provides an academic rationale for giving tax cuts to the rich. The theory is that rich people would invest their windfall in the stock market, providing a morale-boosting injection of funds and investment capital to create jobs, providing \"trickle-down\" wealth to the ordinary people. The supply-siders thus provide a do-gooder gloss to the Bush tax-cut plan, which would hand $81bn (60% of the total reduction) to the richest 13m taxpayers. </p> <p>The foreign affairs team also has an 80s feel to it. Condoleeza Rice, the likely national security adviser in the event of a Bush win, worked for the governor's father, but is a child of the cold-war mentality which reigned supreme under Reagan. Together with Paul Wolfowitz (another hard-line Reaganaut and possible defence secretary), she advocates a much tougher, adversarial stance towards Russia and China, and a much more hard-headed assessment of vital national interests, stripped of the humanitarian interventions which have flourished under the Clinton-Gore administration. </p> <p>In terms of economic and foreign policy then, a Bush White House is likely to be merely a throwback. It is the underlying ethos (what the governor would undoubtedly call \"the heart\") of a future Republican administration that would be truly exotic, even bizarre. </p> <p>Bush's favourite slogan \"compassionate conservatism\" is no empty jingle - it is actually borrowed from a body of work by a pair of obscure conservative gurus, whose influence would surely grow exponentially if the Republicans recapture the White House. One is Myron Magnet, a cultural hawk from the right-wing Manhattan Institute. His rival for George W's heart and soul is a Marxist turned born-again Christian from Texas, Marvin Olasky, who believes the whole machinery of state-provided social welfare should be scrapped in favour of a return to 19th-century-style religious charities and soup kitchens. </p> <p>Olasky has come on a long intellectual journey. Born into a Boston Jewish family in 1950, he renounced his religion at the age of 14 and became an avowed atheist. At Yale, he joined the Communist party and in 1972 travelled to Moscow on a Russian freighter, to prove his Marxist-Leninist ardour. </p> <p>His 180-degree transformation came only a year later, apparently as a result of watching a lot of Hollywood westerns. He was doing a graduate degree in American culture at the University of Michigan, focusing on US cinema. He later said that the profound moral sense of right and wrong he found in the western genre, raised in his Marxist mind the nagging question: \"What if there is a God?\" </p> <p>The answer seems to have been not far behind, because Olasky quickly renounced his Communist affiliation, and converted to evangelical Christianity. </p> <p>He now teaches journalism at the University of Texas, but most of his effort is spent in publishing a right-wing Christian conservative journal ambitiously called World (largely devoted to the denunciation of Bill Clinton and all his evils) and running the church he founded in Austin, the Redeemer Presbyterian. </p> <p>The Redeemer church teaches that women have no place in leadership, having already engineered the fall of man in the Garden of Eden. Olasky once said that there was \"a certain shame attached\" to the idea of voting for a woman, because it meant that men had failed in their role. </p> <p>Olasky also believes that liberal journalists have \"holes in their souls\" and practice \"the religion of Zeus\", which came as something of a surprise to the east-coast press. \"What could he mean?\" they wondered. Frank Rich, a veteran columnist at the New York Times, and one of those accused of having a hole in his soul, said: \"He still hasn't told me whether the religion of Zeus goes in for Bar Mitzvahs.\" </p> <p>These distractions aside, the driving force behind Olasky's church work and his prolific writing is the war against social welfare. His 1992 book, The Tragedy of American Compassion, argues that the Great Society programmes launched in the 1960s sapped the moral strength from the poor by providing a prop: \"Every time we tell someone he is a victim, every time we say he deserves a special break today, every time we hand out charity to someone capable of working, we are hurting rather than helping,\" he argued. </p> <p>Instead, Olasky teaches that charity should be channelled through faith-based organisations, which would distribute largesse accompanied by the required religious fortification, to counter the character-rotting impact of giving things away for nothing. To stand up his conclusions, he once dressed up as a beggar and wandered the streets, reporting back that although he was given food and shelter, his true craving, for a bible, was left unfulfilled. </p> <p> Olasky's golden age for Christian charitable works was the 1890s, when the grateful poor were ministered to by \"slum angels\" who gave \"gladly\" through \"Jesus's love\". It is Thatcherism plus God. </p> <p>All this explains a lot about what has been going on over the past five years in Texas, where social services and government health care have been under intense pressure, even as Governor Bush was informing the rest of the world of his heartfelt compassion. </p> <p>Myron Magnet is cut from similar cloth as Olasky. The conservative prophet sports big Dickensian bushy whiskers (apparently inspired by a stay at Cambridge University), and a Victorian philosophy to match. His seminal work, The Dream and the Nightmare, espouses many of the same ideas as Olasky, arguing that many of the country's present social problems are a direct result of the 60s counterculture, which \"permitted, even celebrated, behaviour that when poor people practice it will imprison them inextricably in poverty.\" </p> <p>Bush said the book \"really helped crystallise some of my thinking about cultures, changing cultures, and of part of the legacy of my generation\". The underlying philosophy has surfaced in his campaign rhetoric in the form of his biting criticism of the philosophy of \"If it feels good, do it\". </p> <p>From an examination of the brains behind Bush's catchphrases, this is more than a promise not to have oral sex in the Oval Office. It suggests a Bush victory next week would bring a new political class to town which looks backwards for its inspiration, not just to the halcyon days of Reagan, but far further, to a bygone Victorian age where there were bibles in the soup kitchens, and the poor knew their place.</p>",
  "Israel's acting foreign minister, Shlomo Ben-Ami, in opposing calls for a UN force to separate the warring sides in the Occupied Territories, accuses Yasser Arafat of trying \"to internationalise the conflict\". The Palestinian leader, he says, lacks faith in US mediation. Israel blocked a UN inquiry into the violence on similar grounds at the Sharm el-Sheikh summit. It is its normal practice. But who is Mr Ben-Ami trying to kid? <p>By any meaningful definition, the Israeli-Palestinian confrontation is already internationalised. It has been since 1948 when Britain withdrew after the UN general assembly backed the partition of Palestine (and, incidentally, a Jerusalem administered by the UN as a corpus separatum). The conflict affects the vital interests of neighbouring Arab states. It is of legitimate historical, political and economic concern to EU countries. It resonates worldwide, among Jews and Muslims alike. </p> <p>Its most likely resolution lies with the international process begun in Madrid in 1991, co-sponsored by Russia. When Israel's leader, Ehud Barak, warns of the risk of regional conflagration, he internationalises it even further. This is hardly a local dispute. And if Mr Arafat distrusts US honest brokerage, who can blame him? He is in company with much of the Arab world, as the recent Cairo summit showed.</p> <p>If the Clinton administration's perceived pro-Israeli tilt has not disqualified its mediation, then its rushed, bungled tactics, particularly at Camp David last July, have. One reason why Mr Arafat will traipse back to the White House this week is that Mr Clinton's chief Middle East aides, Madeleine Albright and Dennis Ross, are no longer seen as impartial. But the Palestinians should not expect different treatment from a Gore or a Bush presidency. </p> <p>Time for the buck to pass. This is a moment when Britain, with its EU partners, could take over the leading role of Middle East mediator. Peter Hain, the Foreign Office minister, told Parliament last month there was an opportunity for the UK \"to play a more prominent role... than we have been able to do\". But this required US \"consent\". Courage, Mr Hain! The Americans have made a mess of it. They are always telling Europe to take on more responsibility. Here is a chance to make a difference. The French (and Russians) would help. And if Javier Solana, the sad tsar of EU foreign policy, cannot show a lead, then Britain must. Or are we really all so subordinate to America?</p>",

  "George W Bush practically swaggered into today's presidential election with a visit to Tennessee intended to taunt Al Gore in his own home state. <p>Whether or not he is ready for the presidency, it was clear yesterday that the Republican Texas governor has emerged from the 18-month quest for the White House as a ruthlessly effective campaigner. </p> <p>By the time he flew in to Chattanooga - on his final lap before returning to Austin, Texas to await the results - his get-out-the-vote speech had become a composite of all the applause lines from a thousand previous appearances. </p> <p>Most of those lines fed the desire for revenge among the Republican rank and file after eight years of Democratic administration, by ridiculing Mr Gore - born and raised in Washington to a liberal senator on whose Tennessee farm the son spent family holidays and helped with the work - as a standard-bearer for the \"Washington elite\". </p> <p>\"He forgot his roots,\" Mr Bush told cheering supporters mustered at an aircraft hangar at Chattanooga airport. \"He forgot where he's from. He trusts Washington. We trust the people.\" </p> <p>\"It's always important to have a place from which to run from. I, of course, come from Texas and I plan to carry my home state. My opponent vows to win in his home state. Well he might win Washington DC, but he's not going to win Tennessee.\" </p> <p>On the eve of the vote, polls showed Mr Bush ahead by 49% to 45% in the state where Mr Gore has spent much of his adult political life, as a congressman and then as a senator. </p> <p>Tennessee's 11 votes in the US electoral college which ultimately decides the presidency will be important in a race that seemed to be getting even closer in the final hours. </p> <p>But the real purpose of the lightning Bush visit was to convey the opposite impression - that the tide was running against the Democratic vice-president, even among those who supposedly know him best. To that end, Mr Bush also put in an appearance in President Clinton's home state, Arkansas, as well as two other states which voted in for Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996: Wisconsin and Iowa. </p> <p>Demographically speaking, Mr Gore's troubles in Tennessee are hardly surprising. He got himself elected here as congressman (in 1976) and then senator by campaigning as a rightwing Democrat, a proud tobacco grower who was against gun control and abortion. </p> <p>\"The whole point is that he's not the same person he was back then. He no longer fits the cultural values of this state,\" Robin Smith, a state Republican activist, said. </p> <p>Lewis Weeks, a retired hospital administration worker who had woken up before dawn to catch sight of Mr Gore's Republican rival, put his dislike of the vice-president in blunter terms. \"I absolutely can't stand Al Gore. I hate the ground he walks on.\" </p> <p>Mr Weeks said this was because Mr Gore advocates a strong role for the federal government - a widespread belief, according to the polls, despite Mr Gore's protestations and Mr Bush's record of expanding state government in Texas. Mr Bush seems to have succeeded in getting his message across better. </p> <p>Tennessee is a state in which a substantial majority believes, in the words of one of Mr Bush's warm-up speakers, \"God should write all public policy\", and the Bush campaign has been effective in portraying the Clinton years of sexual embarrassment as a time of darkness. By this means the Texas governor has also been able to depict a country in crisis despite the record economic growth of the Clinton era. </p> <p>Speaker after speaker on the stage in Chattanooga, spoke of the need for national moral redemption, and Lorretta Lyn, a Tennessee country singer, cooed about \"putting America back on its feet\". </p> <p>Another technique, used extensively at the Republican convention and at every campaign stop since, has been to position black Americans directly behind the candidate. The TV cameras recording this a racially inclusive backdrop seldom capture the whiteness of the rank-and-file. In Chattanooga, where racial politics run deep, there were three black Tennesseans on the Bush podium, but none I could see in a 5,000-strong crowd. </p> <p>The only other blacks in the area were on the far side of the airport fence - two members of the local steelworkers' union holding a lonely demonstration. One of them, James Muckle, declared: \"Our vice-president supports the union, and the working man.\" </p> <p>African-Americans swung Tennessee for Bill Clinton in 1996, but some doubt they will do the same for an understudy, who has never had the same rapport with minorities as his mentor.</p>",
  "The cost of electing George W Bush or Al Gore today as president of the United States comes to a record of almost a third of a billion dollars - and that is without taking into account millions more in \"soft-money\" contributions that are unregulated and hard to track. <p>Mr Bush has raised $187m (\u00a3130m) for his Republican campaign, all but $20m of it spent by a fortnight ago. Mr Gore raised $133m (\u00a392m) for his Democratic campaign, and Ralph Nader of the Green Party raised $6m (\u00a34m), according to the latest official figures. </p> <p>The Republican national commitee has raised another $214m on top of that and the Democrats $179m in unregulated \"soft money\" which was spent across a range of campaigns for president, congressional and local state elections. </p> <p>\"The growing role of money in the political system is a growing problem, yes,\" said Douglas Webber of the non-partisan Centre for Responsive Politics, a research group that monitors contributions to candidates. </p> <p>\"There's just been this constant downpour of money running all over the political process this year. This election will go down as the most expensive by far.\" </p> <p>Mr Gore has said that a campaign finance reform bill will be the first thing he signs if he wins and some senior Republicans have said that they, too, will pursue this matter. The most influential of these is John McCain, Mr Bush's defeated opponent for the Republican nomination to run for the presidency. </p> <p>\"The issue has had enough attention in this campaign that it's safe to assume that there will be some attempt for a change, no matter who wins,\" said Mr Webber. \"Several members of Congress will bring this up.\" </p> <p>Combined spending on the presidential and congressional elections is put at $3bn and on the state contests at another $1bn. Taken together this is an increase of nearly 50% on the 1996 elections in America. </p> <p>Mr Bush raised an unprecedented $100m for his primaries campaign alone; in the much more obscure contest for a New Jersey seat in the US Senate, Jon Corzine, a former chief executive of Goldman Sachs, has spent $60m of his own money. </p> <p>Congressional candidates are limited to donations of $1m maximum from individuals and $5,000 from political committees. But the rules are side-stepped by setting up \"soft money\" committees. </p> <p>These shell organisations accept funds from corporations, trade unions and the wealthy and spend it on advertising and canvassing on behalf of candidates. </p> <p>Mr Gore and Mr Bush have each accepted $67.6m in public funding, supposedly in return for refraining from raising money for their campaigns. Unrestricted \"soft money\" now exceeds those sums to such an extent that the parties and outside groups can spend more than the candidates. </p> <p>The Republican party spent $36m on television advertising in support of Mr Bush in five months to the end of October compared with $28m spent by the candidate's campaign, says a study by the Brennan Centre at New York University. </p> <p>The Democratic party spent $31m, and oustide groups $9m, on advertisements backing Mr Gore in that period, against his campaign's $21m. </p> <p>\"The outstanding development this cycle is that this is the first election in which non-candidate spending in close races for the House of Representatives, Senate and presidency will exceed spending by the candidates,\" said Michael Malbin of the Campaign Finance Institute. </p> <p>Trevor Potter, a former chairman of the Federal Election Commission, said: \"We haven't seen an election like this since 1972 in terms of the effectively unlimited amounts of money being spent.\" </p> <p>Corporations have been prevented for almost 100 years from making direct political contributions but devices are used to get around the federal spending limits, a development attributed most recently to President Clinton and the Democratic Party. </p> <p>Fred Wertheimer of another monitoring group, Democracy 21, said: \"All the fig leaves have disappeared in this election. There is such a sense now that anything goes that people aren't even looking for cover in terms of massive use of unlimited, unregulated funds. </p> <p>\"If you look at 2000 in comparison with other years, campaign records are being shattered everywhere. Not broken but shattered.\"</p>",
  "<p>Consumers could pay as little as \u00a310 a month for new high-bandwidth services made available by the break-up of British Telecom's monopoly of the local telephone network. </p> <p>The first indication of what it will cost the public to acquire high-speed internet connection was given yesterday when the telecoms regulator Oftel announced the proposed prices BT will levy on rivals which want to store their equipment in its exchanges and to take over local lines. </p> <p>Rival operators will have to pay BT \u00a3118 annual rental for each customer they sign up, plus a \u00a395 connection charge. </p> <p>The charges will create a base for operators to set their charges to consumers. If competition is fierce enough, they may even subsidise costs in the hope of generating further revenues through e-commerce. </p> <p>Additional charges could be imposed for specific services such as pay television or for subscription to an internet service provider. </p> <p>Rivals hope to employ ADSL (asymmetric digital subscriber line) technology which can upgrade existing copper wires for uses such as high-speed internet access or the transmission of multi-channel TV. </p> <p>BT's rivals, which have vented their fury at the pace of the so called \"unbundling of the local loop\" were for once satisfied with the charges. </p> <p>Bob Cushing, group marketing and business development director at Redstone Telecom, said: \"The thing that will make the largest difference to operators over time is the charge for line rental, and that's not bad.\" </p> <p>Mr Cushing was critical, however, of hidden charges for all but the most simple of installations. Households that want separate lines for voice calls and ADSL, for instance, face a charge of \u00a3262. </p> <p>The proposed charge for connecting 100 lines to an operator's equipment is an annual \u00a321 rental and a \u00a31,433 connection charge. </p> <p>Other costs which rival operators will incur include rental of space within BT exchanges and their contribution to energy costs. </p> <p>BT said the figures were in line with what it had been expecting. </p> <p>David Edmonds, Oftel director general described the charges as \"another important step towards local loop unbundling\". </p> <p>He said: \"I am confident that these charges are at a level that will encourage competition in the provision of broadband services. They will allow other operators to provide new higher-bandwidth services to consumers at competitive prices.\" </p> <p>The consultation period on the proposed charges will end on December 4 after which date there will be a final determination in time for the prices to take effect at the start of next year.</p>",
  "I voted this week. I dug through a pile of papers to find my absentee ballot, scribbled a quick \"x\", and jammed the forms into an envelope before I could change my mind. It was very exciting. It was very painful. I voted for Ralph Nader for president of the United States. <p>It wasn't an easy decision. The person I realistically want to win the election is Al Gore. And if he loses to Bush, a Catholic sense of guilt inherited from my father (minus the actual Catholicism) will leave me feeling that I am personally responsible. But even if Bush becomes our next president, I do not believe my vote will have been wasted. Nader's candidacy will have left an indelible mark on the American political script. </p> <p>It was thanks to Nader that I started paying attention to the elections. I spent the early months of the race doing my damnedest to avoid it. I refused to vote in the primaries. </p> <p>Then I heard this summer that the Green party was running a candidate and that he was doing pretty well. I started looking for election stories. I scanned magazines for profiles of Nader. What I found, to my great relief, was someone echoing some of my own concerns - reasserting the supremacy of democracy over capitalism, universal health care, support for trade unions - and being taken seriously. By September, when I went back to the States for a visit, I was determined to register for an absentee ballot. </p> <p>Voting for Nader felt like a tiny step into a broader movement, an act that connected me with protesters in Seattle and Prague. While I was in the States I gave the Greens a small donation, my first to a political party. Just for good measure, I also gave a little to the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. Hardly revolutionary acts, but they are a modest start and far more than Gore could have inspired me to. </p> <p>The last time I was this excited about voting was in 1992 when Bill Clinton was first running for president, promising to end what seemed, from my 20-year-old perspective, like an endless Republican reign in the White House. I imagined Clinton would throw open the White House doors and let a fresh breeze of liberalism air out a stale den of conservatism. </p> <p>Then came the don't ask, don't tell policy. Then the collapse of the health-care project. Then welfare reform. Then Monica Lewinsky. It became obvious that Clinton is not a champion of the left, but a page boy for a nebulous centre. </p> <p>Just because you're enthusiastic about the person you're voting for, it doesn't mean you'll get a fairytale ending. Idealistic voting doesn't always work. Gore's supporters won't let us forget that. \"A vote for Nader is a vote for Bush,\" they shout, like it's a campaign slogan. There's some truth to that. If Nader weren't around and the race was still this close I might have been frightened into voting for Gore. But what is the value of a vote cast out of fear? </p> <p>The Democrats are treating their liberal supporters as though the only thing they have to do to earn our votes is conjure up the spectre of a Republican presidency. That's not enough. My vote is my power as a citizen of a democracy. If I allow the Democratic party to convince me that I have no choices at the polling booth, then I allow them to strip me of that power. The only way to make the Democratic leadership pay attention is by showing them I can take my vote elsewhere. The wonderful thing about this election is that liberal Americans have finally been offered an elsewhere. </p> <p>It's not easy to vote for Nader. The potential consequences are serious. But then, it only matters when it hurts. What are the \"a vote for Nader is a vote for Bush\" people trying to suggest? That you should support a third party only if it has no impact on the race whatsoever? What would be the point then? For the ideas that Nader and the Green party represent to have an impact, it's got to sting a little. </p> <p>That sting is already making a difference. Gore has been forced to acknowledge Nader's presence. With enough votes, maybe Nader and the Greens can keep that momentum going, get the left organised again into a more viable political force. </p> <p>Or we could simply vote for the lesser of two evils. But then we shouldn't be surprised if we always end up with evil. I think it's worth giving idealism another try. </p> <p>\u0095 Tara Mack is an American journalist based in London </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Right, have I got everything? Plenty of wood for the fire; black coffee; snacks; matches (for lighting up if it's tense, for propping open eyelids if it's boring); whisky for drowning sorrows (probably); pens; map of the United States for colouring in the results, TV doofer (where's it hidden THIS time, then?) to switch to CNN if the BBC gets really irritating . . . <p>No, I'm not sad; perfectly happy, actually. I love election nights, whenever and wherever. The psephologist David Butler once said that, for him, they were the equivalent of cup finals. In the case of American elections, the analogy is an exact one for us ballot-omanes. We don't really have a direct interest but pick a team anyway, and pretend we're really bothered. </p> <p>An American election has to be second-best to our own because no other country - it is a small British boast - gets the comedy-drama of election night as right as we do. We cannot reasonably expect to see anything on TV in the early hours of tomorrow as cathartic as the eclipse of Portillo. Nor will the next leader of the United States have to stand next to a defeated candidate with a bucket on his head, as John Major did when the Huntingdon result was declared in 1992. </p> <p>Indeed, we will not see any results being announced at all. Screeds will appear on the screen, announcing that 3% of the precincts have been counted in Mississippi or somewhere; network analysts will crunch the numbers and then hand Mississippi to Bush. If it's close, it may take longer. But the human factor will be absent. This may be one reason why less than half of US adults vote, compared to 75% in Britain. </p> <p> Close votes are the best, no matter what the occasion. The tension in the final stages of the referendum on Welsh devolution, when everything depended on the response of a handful of voters in Carmarthen, was mind-blowing. For an ideal election night, though, you need a closely-fought front-line battle and innumerable subplots. The problem with American elections is that the real subplots - ie the sub-subplots - won't make it on to TV at all. </p> <p>Most politics junkies like to pretend that their hobby is actually IMPORTANT, unlike sport, which is entirely TRIVIAL. But Americans long ago concluded (another reason why they don't vote) that it makes no difference who the president is. If elected, George Dubya could theoretically get confused between Russia and Moscow and, say, Rusholme and Moss Side, and blow South Manchester to smithereens any time after January 20 next year. But the world survived eight years of Ronald Reagan. Al Gore may be more clued-up about global warming. However, if he gets in, he will still want to carry Michigan in 2004, so he is unlikely to raise fuel tax much, even if Congress would let him. </p> <p>In so far as this election matters to Americans, it matters on levels way beneath our radar. The main election issue in Pawnee County, Kansas, (I see from the Great Bend Tribune) is whether large-scale dairy farms should be allowed there. Meanwhile, Louisiana is voting on Amendment 4, which would let local government hand over money dedicated to economic development directly to companies that agree to move to the area. The Opelousas Daily World is against it. Their world is a small one, but they ain't stupid. \"It will open the way to cronyism. Enough said.\" </p> <p>There is a fierce battle to be county prosecutor in Cheboygan County, Michigan. Tim MacArthur was appointed (by his ex-law partner, opponents note) when the job fell vacant, but now has to face the voters. \"My family has lived in Cheboygan County for over 130 years,\" he says, \"and I was raised here with old-fashioned values.\" A local cop, however, claims that McArthur knows nothing of criminal law while his opponent, Ms Mickey Castagne, is a tough prosecutor: \"The choice couldn't be clearer if keeping our community safe from crime is your primary concern.\" </p> <p>In North Dakota (says the Devils Lake Journal), Mary Eksteen is hoping to be the first Democrat to be elected state auditor since 1892. The Idaho Statesman tells us they do have a Democratic sheriff in Ada County, Idaho. Many Republicans there like Frank Walker, but their state party chairman, Trent Clark, is cross with them: \"It's one thing having a get-along go-along Democrat who works well with his colleagues. But Frank Walker is very partisan. He campaigns on weekends for Democrats. His kids put up signs for Democrats. Frank Walker will hurt us.\" . </p> <p>And so on and on and on . . . from sea to shining sea. We won't hear the outcome of any of these contests before dawn tomorrow. But some of these results might actually affect the voters - rather more than Gore v Bush. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:matthewengel@ndirect.co.uk\">matthewengel@ndirect.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>A strange day in the Square Mile.

Most important is the US presidential election, though Gordon Brown's pre-Budget statement and the meeting of the monetary policy committee are also causing some anxiety. </p> <p>A victory for George Bush is seen by the City as the favoured outcome for equities because his hands-off business policies and tax cuts are likely to keep the US economy ticking along at a fair rate. But until the result is known, traders are not prepared to chase the higher end of the market. </p> <p>So dealers decided to turn their attention either to defensive stocks or altogether less taxing matters. One subject drawing an unusual amount of attention was the prospects of a small dot.com company called <strong> Arthur Shaw</strong>. Many traders sat transfixed as the share price of the engineering company-turned-internet content provider, which boasts the former manager of Pink Floyd as chairman, dived 0.625p, or 13.71%, to 3.775p. </p> <p>According to the market gossips, Arthur Shaw is having problems getting its business - broadcasting live events such as pop concerts over the web - operating. Apparently big City institutions are proving reluctant to back the company because of concerns about the make-up of the board. However, chairman Bryan Morrison insisted that things were going well. \"We have plenty of money in the bank,\" he said yesterday. </p> <p>Away from such sideshows the FTSE 100 finally came to rest 45.6 points ahead at 6,431, with the FTSE 250 adding 77.6 to 6,826.8. </p> <p>With investors plumping for defensive issues, technology and telecom issues were bound to suffer. The TechMark eased 0.87 to 3,498.51, with <strong> Vodafone</strong> having another miserable session, falling 10p to 243p as last week's profit downgrades continued to undermine sentiment. </p> <p> <strong> Energis</strong> was also unloved, falling 13p to 540p. Over in the tech sector, <strong> Sema Group</strong> dropped 32p to 857p and <strong> Misys</strong> shed 18p to 725p. </p> <p> <strong> Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> failed to join in the \"old economy\" buying spree, falling 13p to 185p with investors unsettled by a number of reports suggesting today's figures will make gloomy reading. </p> <p>News that ex-Asda chief Allan Leighton has teamed up with Philip Green at Bhs was also viewed as negative. Far from trying to take over M&amp;S, it seems Mr Green and his dream team are going to tackle the ailing retailer head-on. </p> <p> <strong> British Airways</strong> continued the good work of last week, rising 21p to 351p on the back interim figures which, the market's more clairvoyant players had guessed, were better than expected. </p> <p>In fact, they were almost a carbon copy of last week's figures from KLM, which had started the buying spree. Sentiment was also boosted by news that the group wants to offload Go, its budget airline. </p> <p>Lower down the corporate scale, <strong> Thus </strong> slipped 6p to 84p on talk that Wednesday's results are going to make tough reading, and <strong> Manchester United </strong> added 17p to 249p after securing a \u00a3300m sponsorship deal with Nike. </p> <p>Floor coverings and furnishings group <strong> Headlam</strong>, down 22.5p to 135p, was rocked by the departure of its chief executive.</p>",
  "Over the past 10 days, liberals have been voicing shock and dismay at the imminent prospect of their old hero, Ralph Nader, intentionally throwing the election to George W Bush. A first, eloquent protest came 10 days ago from a group of a dozen former \"Nader's Raiders,\" who asserted that their former mentor had broken a promise not to campaign in states where he could hurt Gore and begged him to reconsider doing so. Others, including Newsweek columnist Jonathan Alter, have expressed a similar sense of disappointment and betrayal. <p>Nader's response to all this heartfelt hand-wringing has been to scoff and sneer. On Good Morning America, he referred contemptuously to his old disciples as \"frightened liberals\". The Green party nominee is spending the final week of the campaign stumping in Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Oregon, and Washington - the very states where a strong showing stands to hurt Gore the most. </p> <p>Nader has said he wants to maximise his vote in every state in hopes of attaining the 5% of the vote that will qualify the Green party for $12m in federal matching funds in 2004. Speaking to foreign journalists in Washington yesterday, he explicitly rejected internet vote-swapping schemes that could help him reach this qualifying threshold without the side-effect of electing Bush president. In various other TV appearances, Nader has stated bluntly that he couldn't care less who wins. </p> <p>This depraved indifference to Republican rule has made Nader's old liberal friends even more furious. A bunch of intellectuals organised by Sean Wilentz and Todd Gitlin are circulating a much nastier open letter, denouncing Nader's \"wrecking-ball campaign - one that betrays the very liberal and progressive values it claims to uphold\". </p> <p>But really, the question shouldn't be the one liberals seem to be asking about why Nader is doing what he's doing. The question should be why anyone is surprised. For some time now, Nader has made it perfectly clear that his campaign isn't about trying to pull the Democrats back to the left. Rather, his strategy is the Leninist one of \"heightening the contradictions\". It's not just that Nader is willing to take a chance of being personally responsible for electing Bush. It's that he's actively trying to elect Bush because he thinks that social conditions in American need to get worse before they can better. </p> <p>Nader often makes this \"the worse, the better\" point on the stump in relation to Republicans and the environment. He says that the Reagan-era interior secretary James Watt was useful because he was a \"provocateur\" for change, noting that Watt spurred a massive boost in the Sierra Club's membership. More recently, Nader applied the same logic to Bush himself. Here's the Los Angeles Times' account of a speech Nader gave at Chapman University in Orange, California, last week: \"After lambasting Gore as part of a do-nothing Clinton administration, Nader said, 'If it were a choice between a provocateur and an anaesthetiser, I'd rather have a provocateur. It would mobilise us.' \" </p> <p>Lest this remark be considered an aberration, Nader has said similar things before. \"When [the Democrats] lose, they say it's because they are not appealing to the Republican voters,\" Nader told an audience in Madison, Wisconsin, a few months ago, according to a story in the Nation. \"We want them to say they lost because a progressive movement took away votes.\" </p> <p>That might make it sound like Nader's goal is to defeat Gore in order to shift the Democratic party to the left. But in a more recent interview with David Moberg in the socialist paper In These Times, Nader made it clear that his real mission is to destroy and then replace the Democratic party altogether. According to Moberg, Nader talked \"about leading the Greens into a 'death struggle' with the Democratic party to determine which will be the majority party\". Nader further and shockingly explained that he hopes in the future to run Green party candidates around the country, including against such progressive Democrats as Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, Senator Russell Feingold of Wisconsin, and Representative Henry Waxman of California. \"I hate to use military analogies,\" Nader said, \"but this is war on the two parties.\" </p> <p> Hitler analogies always lead to trouble, but the one here is irresistible since Nader is actually making the argument of the German Communist party circa 1932, which helped bring the Nazis to power. I'm not comparing the Republicans to fascists or the Greens to Stalinists for that matter. But Nader and his supporters are emulating a disturbing, familiar pattern of sectarian idiocy. </p> <p>You hear these echoes whenever Nader criticises Bush half-heartedly, then becomes enthusiastic and animated blasting the Green version of the \"social fascists\" - Bill Clinton, Gore, and moderate environmentalists. It's clear that the people he really despises are those who half agree with him. </p> <p>To Nader, it is liberal meliorists, not rightwing conservatives, who are the true enemies of his effort to build a \"genuine\" progressive movement. He does have a preference between Republicans and Democrats, and it's for the party that he thinks will inflict maximum damage on the environment, civil rights, labour rights, and so on. By assisting his class enemy, Nader thinks he can help pull the wool from the eyes of a sheep-like public. </p> <p>If Nader's goal were actually progressive reform - a ban on soft money, a higher minimum wage, health-care coverage for some of the uninsured, a global warming treaty - it would be possible to say that his strategy was breathtakingly stupid. But Nader's goal is not progressive reform; it's a transformation in human consciousness. His Green party will not flourish under Democratic presidents who lull the country into a sense of complacency by making things moderately better. If it is to thrive, it needs villainous, rightwing Republicans who will make things worse. </p> <p>Like Pat Buchanan, Nader understands that his movement thrives on misery. But the comparison is actually unfair to Buchanan (words I never thought I'd write) because Buchanan doesn't work to create more misery for the sake of making his movement grow the way Nader does. From a strictly self-interested point of view, Nader's stance is the more rational one. </p> <p>So Gore supporters might as well quit warning the Green candidate that he's going to put George W Bush in White House. Ralph Nader is a very intelligent man who knows exactly what's he doing. And they only seem to be encouraging him. </p> <p> This has been extracted from Slate magazine <a href=\"http://www.slate.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.slate.com</a></p>",
  "Once upon a time, politics was easy. Two rules governed almost every move. First, the choice could be defined as left versus right, and allegiances arranged themselves accordingly. In the 1951 British election, when 83% turned out to vote, 97% of them voted Labour or Conservative. Second, economic competence, as proved or disproved in the previous few years, had a correlation with the next election result. There seemed to be a direct trade-off between votes and jobs. Democracies rewarded leaders who supplied high growth, low inflation and reduced unemployment. <p>Neither rule any longer holds. Allegiance has lost the glue of heavy doctrinal disagreement. Politicians no longer refer to themselves, or the other side, as left or right (though it was startling to read in Peter Mandelson's important Morrison lecture last week a straight-faced reference to \"what Tony Blair calls One Nation socialism\" - a phrase not recently heard, I think, from Mr Blair). Simultaneously, economic success no longer guarantees anything. Look at Al Gore. He inherits the longest run of economic prosperity on every count - jobs, growth, stock market - America has known, but may today become the most shocking loser in American history. </p> <p>So America is replacing old paradigms. A sound economy is the basis not for endorsing present office-holders but flirting with their enemies. Instead of competence, the people dabble with dignity, respect, leadership and similar abstractions layered with moral coating. For Mr Blair, a Gore defeat will be worrying not because it signals, other than to exuberant rightist pattern-makers, the fall of the centre-left, but because it shows how unreliable the rewards can be for that old elusive goal, a solid economic record. Should Blair, also, be seeking an alternative appeal? Facing his own crisis, in the form of fuel protests, will he do so? </p> <p>In this de-racinated environment, nobody can be sure how big the crisis will be. A number of epithets fit the electorate that has evolved from the tribal, committed body of half-a-century ago. How about cynical, disbelieving, fickle, grasping, materialistic, self-centred, loose, indifferent? Perhaps it can't be relied on to identify the higher good, as against instant advantage. More engaged and less moralistic than the US electorate, it may be regarded as no less frightening. There's a temptation to search as desperately as Al Gore and George W Bush for the tricksy embraces that will win it over. </p> <p>This is not only unnecessary. It would also be dangerous. For one thing, Britain is at a different point in the electoral cycle, year four not year eight of a government the voters might feel free to get bored with, and casually throw out despite unprecedented economic prosperity. More important, it's by no means clear that in the end the British electorate want governments to be as irresolute as they are themselves. The old anchors have gone, but two new rules are cardinal in Blair's present situation. </p> <p>First, the government can't credibly amend its commitment to long-term economic stability. It paid a heavy political price for declaring this ambition from the start, and running public spending on a tight rein in its first two years. That's why health and transport, and now environmental protection, still show painful evidence of under-spending, more than three years in. The justification for that would be destroyed by a panicky pre-election blow-out. </p> <p>In his speech to the CBI yesterday, Gordon Brown rammed home the long-termist message. Many chancellors have spouted it before him. Nigel Lawson thought his tax-cutting 1988 budget laid the base for a long-term transformation of the economy; instead it contained the seed of the boom-and-bust that persisted into the 1990s. Mr Brown is making a believable virtue of the stability which is the goal he clings to. His prudent, sonorous, Scottish presence at the Treasury personifies the very reverse of fickleness. It's the essential precondition of survival for the governing party Labour has become. In place of left-right dialectic, he says, we offer a massive determination not to yield to short-term pressures. It's what - sometimes to our cost, and some times, as with pensions, by inhuman negligence we must correct - we are about. </p> <p>Second, the government needs to be in charge of politics. The lures the other way are devious and spectacularly dishonest. Watching the next bout of fuel protest gather, one sees newspapers apparently more united against it than they were last time, and a Conservative leadership mouthing its refusal to support direct action. But the words have weaselly accompaniments. We sympathise with the hauliers' predicament, says the Mail, we must understand their pain. By implication, their case is serious. Likewise, Conservative PR hacks like Lord Bell note the body of opinion which, according to a Sunday poll, would support further haulier blockades. Affecting merely clinical interest, on Breakfast with Frost, he can barely conceal a foaming excitement at the prospect. </p> <p> From a party viewpoint he may be right. The Tories look with keenest anticipation on the possible breakdown of Britain. But this only makes clearer the course the government must take. People expect it, above all else, to keep the country running. The lures must be resisted. So must the threats and the bogus ridicule. Of the many false arguments made in defence of the hauliers, the most corrupt is the claim that, if trouble now happens, ministers are to blame for taking measures to anticipate it. That such a travesty can be seriously touted in the same leader columns that two months ago were chiding ministers for their lack of readiness shows how political this dispute has become. If Blair wins this one, they're saying, he's got the election cold. Let us therefore do our best to see he doesn't. </p> <p>The public, however, takes a more complex attitude. It long ago lost the habit of political allegiance. It can still tell pollsters, before the damage starts, that it supports direct action in favour of lower fuel duties. But in the end it wants governments to govern. In its wisdom, it knows that this is how things must be, and also, even more plainly, that the alternative government now on offer is a non-starter. It is ready to channel short-termism, lower petrol prices, into temporary protest, but long-termism - its preference for future government - into the resumption of support for Labour, as was shown very clearly in opinion polls taken soon after the September calamities were over. </p> <p>To underpin this, Labour needs no quick fixes. Calling the government out of touch is another bogus crack. What would be out of touch would be to slide into submission to violent protest. The old anchors may have gone, but the demand for a government that does not drift from strategy and conviction has not. If anything, Labour ministers have been short of that quality. The fuel issue obliges them to reaffirm it. They're right to make their economic choice, and right to prepare their political defence, pending proof from the voters, at the democratic moment, that it's what they want. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:hugoyoung@compuserve.com\">hugoyoung@compuserve.com</a></p>",
  "It was rather maddening to see repeated the false US Republican assertion that Ross Perot cost their party the White House in 1992 (Eyes left, October 25). He did nothing of the kind. Perot drew equally from the supporters of the elder George Bush and Bill Clinton. <p>Furthermore, Perot was rightwing only by European standards; so too are virtually all American politicians except Ralph Nader. Perot stood to the left of the Republican party on such issues as tax, abortion, foreign policy, international trade and campaign finance reform. In Nader's case, however, almost none of his supporters see the junior Bush as their second choice. If Gore loses, Nader will have been a highly relevant factor in making Gore's leftwing support more tepid than it would otherwise have been. <br> <b>Andrew Hirsch</b><br> Bainbridge Island, Washington state <a href=\"mailto:andrewhirsch@uswest.net\">andrewhirsch@uswest.net</a></p> <p>Jonathan Freedland (The winner will dictate, November 1) writes that the US supreme court protects abortion rights by a \"knife's edge\" and that if George Bush becomes president the US \"would become a land where no pregnancy can be legally terminated\". The supreme court had the opportunity in the 1992 Casey case to overturn Roe v Wade. The majority, which included pro-lifers, concluded that Roe v Wade was established legal precedent which makes it unlikely to be overturned. One of the dissenters in Casey has already been replaced by a pro-choice justice. </p> <p>Even if Bush (who said he would not use abortion as a litmus test for judicial appointments) appointed, as Freedland suggests, conservative, anti-abortion judges, they have to be approved by a majority in a closely divided senate, which is unlikely. <br> <b> Prof Colleen Graffy</b><br> Pepperdine University London  <a href=\"mailto:colleen.graffy@pepperdine.edu\">colleen.graffy@pepperdine.edu</a></p>",
  "Jimmie Davis, who has died at the reputed age of 101, stood largely alone in the murky world of Louisiana politics. The apparent author of one of the world's best known songs, You Are My Sunshine, he twice served as state governor. At last year's celebration of his 100th birthday, one of his successors, Edwin Edwards - who spent most of his final term on trial for corruption - paid an awed tribute. \"Just imagine,\" he said, \"Jimmie served two terms as governor and was never indicted. That's a genuine achievement.\" It was also a pretty close-run thing. <p>Yet, in the appalling political culture established by the Long family, Davis's legislative record was surprisingly benign. In a state still described as \"America's banana republic\", suffering some of the country's highest cancer, Aids and premature death rates, he introduced free school milk, accelerated hospital building, special care for the mentally ill and 6,000 miles of new roads. </p> <p>Davis claimed, at different times, to have been born in any year from 1899 to 1902. As sharecroppers in north Louisiana's cottonfields, his parents jammed 12 children into a two-roomed shack, and remained uncertain of the order of their birth. Davis said he had never slept in a bed until he was nine, and recalled a Christmas gift the children once received - a skinned blackbird and a dried pig's bladder. \"We ate the bird, and played ball with the bladder. I've never been happier with anything I've had since.\" </p> <p>Davis studied hard, at primary school, high school, and Louisiana College, graduating in education. After a year teaching at his old primary school, he enrolled at Louisiana state university for a master's degree. Throughout this period, he also pursued his musical career. </p> <p>In 1929, he became clerk to Shreveport city court. Huey Long had just become governor of Louisiana, exerting his demagogic power and offering his share-the-wealth policy of social services and vast public works - which were mostly a mechanism to siphon off huge sums for himself. For 10 years, Davis quietly consolidated his own political career, combining it with increasing popularity as a singer. In 1938, he won his first election, becoming commissioner of public safety for Shreveport - controlling the police and fire services. </p> <p>He soon moved to the state public service commission, a body at the heart of the Long family's financial shenanigans. From this key position, he emerged as the likeliest figure to unite the state's bitterly feuding political factions, the Long family and those they had ousted from their lucrative state pickings. </p> <p>In 1944, with most of America's attention fixed on the second world war, Davis launched one of the most eccentric gubernatorial campaigns in US history. Relying on his musical reputation, he took his band across the state, concentrating primarily on giving the crowds a good time - and romped into the governor's mansion. </p> <p>One of his first acts was to introduce driving licences to a population which had never thought them necessary. Though he successfully advanced the social measures being advocated nationally by his old ally President Truman, he was criticised for frequent absences from the office, not least to star in a 1947 Hollywood film about his own life. </p> <p>Unable, under state law, to succeed himself, he concentrated throughout the 1950s on a musical career. But in 1960, with the explosive issue of desegregation filling the political horizon, he was again elected governor as a compromise candidate. </p> <p>Davis then seemed to act as just another redneck bigot, calling five special sessions of the state legislature to combat federal desegregation orders, and eventually seeing this rearguard campaign struck down by the US supreme court. He later justified his actions on the grounds that they offered the least bad option. \"Everybody ran on the segregation ticket. You couldn't be elected without it. When desegregation came, we did it without having anybody killed. We didn't even have a fist-fight\". </p> <p>His first wife died in 1968. He is survived by his second wife, Anna, and a son. </p> <p> <b>Tony Russell writes:</b> Jimmie Davis always maintained that You Are My Sunshine was his bright idea. When reminded that other artists had recorded the song before him, he invented even earlier sessions at which, he claimed, he had recorded it, but, unsatisfied, vetoed its release. </p> <p>The truth seems to be that Davis bought the song for $35 from a musician who needed to pay his wife's hospital bills. Its brilliance all but conceals a period when Davis specialised in suggestive songs like Jelly Roll Blues and Tom Cat And Pussy Blues. </p> <p> He began singing in quartets at college, and in 1927-28 had a radio programme on station KWKH in Shreveport. His first records were sentimental cowboy songs, then came raunchy narrative blues, such as She's A Hum Dum Dinger From Dingersville or Bear Cat Mama From Horners Corners, decorated with mellifluous yodelling in the style of the contemporary country singer, Jimmie Rodgers. </p> <p>Davis sang blues, and associated with blues people; unusually for the period, he was accompanied on record by African-Americans, the guitarists Ed Schaffer and Oscar Woods. In 1934, he recorded the wheedling love song Nobody's Darlin' But Mine. A crossover hit before the term was coined, it was covered by Bing Crosby and in Britain by Ambrose's orchestra. </p> <p>Thereafter, Davis turned his back on the blues, but did not sever his low-life connections. As commissioner for public safety, he put his bandleader and other musicians on the local payroll and, many contemporaries believe, used his position as police chief to drop charges against arrested musicians if they signed over the rights to their songs. </p> <p>Certainly, the catalogue of songs credited, or part-credited, to Davis includes many to which his claim is legal rather than authorial. The country singer Floyd Tillman, half of whose income from his song, It Makes No Difference Now, went into Davis's pocket, told me with a contemptuous sniff: \"Jimmie Davis never wrote a song in his life.\" </p> <p>Until the early 1940s, Davis was a country music star of almost Gene Autry magnitude. After his first term as governor, he stopped playing in dance halls but continued to broadcast and record, now leaning towards gospel music. He sang from the stump in subsequent campaigns, but, when it failed to work in 1972, quit politics and devoted himself to his extensive publishing interests. </p> <p><b> Jimmie Houston Davis, musician and politician, born September 11 1899; died November 5 2000</b></p>",

  "An angry and embittered woman appeared before a Paris court yesterday armed with enough ammunition to sink President Jacques Chirac's re-election campaign before it gets properly under way. <p>Xavi\u00e8re Tiberi, the wife of the embattled mayor of Paris, Jean Tiberi, went on trial again a year after the case against her was dropped on a technicality. </p> <p>The case arises from a series of potentially explosive criminal investigations into sleaze in President Chirac's conservative Rally for the Republic (RPR) party. </p> <p>There is nothing particularly outrageous about the offence with which Mrs Tiberi is charged.The prosecution alleges that in 1994 she was paid \u00a321,000 by the district council of Essonne, just outside Paris, which was led at the time by Xavier Dugoin, a now-disgraced former RPR senator and close political ally of her husband. </p> <p>Investigating magistrates discovered that the only work she did for the council was to produce a laughable 36-page report, most of it copied from a book and stuffed with elementary mistakes, on the prospects for economic cooperation between Essonne and French-speaking countries. </p> <p>Compared with some of the other alleged dodgy dealings in the Paris town hall while Mr Chirac was mayor from 1987 to 1995 - before he won the presidential elections and passed the mayor's job on to his once - loyal lieutenant Jean Tiberi - this is small beer. </p> <p>Two magistrates are investigating claims that hundreds of RPR activists were given well-paid but non-existent jobs at city hall, others are looking at the increasing evidence that the party's coffers were illegally filled by kickbacks from building companies with Paris council housing contracts. </p> <p>RPR officials have tried before to halt the investigation of Mrs Tiberi's now-infamous report. </p> <p>Late in 1996 the justice ministry chartered a helicopter in the Himalayas and sent the first-secretary of the French embassy in Nepal into the mountains to bring back the holidaying state prosecutor, who might have been able to dismiss the case. </p> <p>This time the stakes are even higher. The French equivalent of Private Eye, Le Canard Enchain\u00e9, has quoted former city hall colleagues of Mr Chirac as saying that the future president was personally responsible for ensuring that Mrs Tiberi was given a fake job by a friendly local council. </p> <p>But the main reason the RPR is worried by Mrs Tiberi's appearance in the dock is that her efficient but uncharismatic husband was kicked out of the party last month, having refused to accept its decision that a more glamorous heavyweight candidate should stand for mayor in next year's municipal elections. </p> <p>A furious Mr Tiberi has already issued a thinly veiled warning that he is not prepared to carry the can for the illicit fundraising and other scams allegedly presided over by his more illustrious predecessor. His wife, who has sworn to \"stand by him till the end\", could prove to be his best weapon. </p> <p>\"She is understandably absolutely livid,\" said a Chirac aide who asked not to be named. </p> <p>\"She was already fed up with her husband taking the corruption flak. This is a couple which has nothing to lose - she could prove very, very dangerous.\" </p> <p>Mrs Tiberi was not called upon to speak in court yesterday, when the opening statements were made. </p> <p>The court is expected to deliver its verdict later this month.</p>"
