  "In a one billion-dollar campaign for the most powerful job on the planet, it is frightening that America is being offered a choice between two flawed scions of self-perpetuating political dynasties. <p>The rules of this fight, as Robert Reich explains on these pages, have meant that both George Bush and Al Gore have assiduously avoided the big issues in order to reassure the narrowest band of swing voters, while not scaring their own supporters. The campaign has become an election of concealment, avoiding key issues that confront America in the new millennium - its socially corrosive poverty, its pervasive culture of violence, its failing justice system and the wider role of America in the world.</p> <p>Al Gore, for all the slickness of his convention performance, has come across as arrogant and prone to exaggeration. In cutting himself loose from the Democratic Party's biggest asset, the formidable campaigning skills of Bill Clinton, his judgment has also come into question. Most worrying is the way in which, in his pursuit of the centre, he has downplayed issues formerly so important to him, such as gun control, poverty and social inclusion.</p> <p>But beneath his calculated evasion, Mr Gore remains wedded to continuing the broad thrust of the policies of the Clinton administration. His is a vision of an inclusive state which, despite its faults, would remain committed to social justice and to America's role as a force for constructive change in a wider world.</p> <p>Which brings us to George Bush, the candidate who really scares us, and who should really scare America. He has positioned himself as the Washington outsider, uncorrupted, as he would have it, by the cynicism of 'beltway' politics.</p> <p>But in a campaign where Republicans have outspent the Democrats by two-to-one, Bush represents a wider corruption of the American political system - by corporate self-interest.</p> <p>A Bush presidency would see a harshening of American society and a deepening of its social faultlines. In Bush's America, the rich would become richer, while moves to reform gun controls and judicial application of the death penalty would be set back a generation. A Bush administration would also rewrite his country's relationship with the world, rejecting cautious internationalism in favour of a new US unilateralism.</p> <p>On these grounds, we must hope that it is Al Gore - for all his flaws - who wins next week's election.</p>",
  "With onl a bit over a week to go, Al Gore and George W. Bush are still neck and neck in the polls. This is the closest race since the Kennedy-Nixon election of 1960. But unlike that race, this one is something of a bore. Most Americans aren't very interested in who's to be the next leader of the world's most powerful nation. In 1960, most adult Americans turned out to vote. This time around, it's predicted that fewer than half will bother. The presidential election of 2000 will go down as one of the closest and most boring in American history. <p>The conventional Washington explanation for this is that there aren't any large issues facing America. Peace and prosperity have lured Americans into smug torpor. So the candidates' styles, smiles, sighs, smirks and quirks have become determinative. And by these trifling criteria, it's a toss up. Just wait, the pundits assure us: When the stakes are higher, we'll have a real election again. </p> <p>This is nonsense. America is not lacking large issues - among them, the incarceration of a record-shattering two million of our citizens, the expanding use of capital punishment here, the almost one in every five of American children still living in poverty, the unprecedented gap in income and wealth, the resegregation of the our schools, and the overwhelming dominance of money in American politics. There have been no large issues in this presidential campaign because the two major candidates and their handlers have avoided them. </p> <p>The closeness and dullness of this election is a consequence the strategies pursued by both sides. And it presages future American presidential elections that will be just as close and dull. </p> <p>From the start of the Bush and the Gore campaigns, both launched more than two years ago, the objective was clear: 'Forty percent are with us, 40 against, so we need to keep our base and take as much of the middle 20 as possible,' one consultant explained to me with the antiseptic certainty of an eye surgeon wielding a laser machine. </p> <p>Add to this that each campaign has been a marvel of technological wizardry. The candidates and their handlers have been able to discover exactly what voters think, what they want to hear, and what turns them off - even down to phrases and words, the style of clothing, the tilt of the head, the use of body, the intonation of the voice. Focus groups, dialometers, media labs, word labs, and mountains of bytes and bits of data have been analysed and econometricized. A mountain of money has been spent devising and airing advertisements cunningly tailored to particular groups of targeted voters in swing states. </p> <p>Some of this happened in past elections. But never with such sophisticated tools, with such an abundance of information backed by so much cash. The election of 2000 is the first major encounter between the digital economy and American politics. </p> <p>Bush and Gore also have been the most pliable of candidates, willing to try anything, say anything, do anything, wear anything that worked. Each followed the directions of his handlers and consultants to the letter. Each stayed on script, avoided risks, and experimented only within a narrow zone of safety in order to more precisely adjust the resonance to accomplish the mission. </p> <p>Bush's brand of 'compassionate conservatism', conveyed with wide-eyed smile and innocent shrug of the shoulders, is different in detail from Gore's 'practical idealism', expressed in stentorian tones and sweeping movements of the arms. But because the differences have been calculated to achieve the same end - keeping intact respective bases while claiming as much of the middle as possible - the positions and styles have inevitably converged. </p> <p>Gore's flirtation with old-fashioned American populism has been targeted at the big drug companies, HMOs and oil companies that most Americans distrust. Gore has not attacked corporate America in general, of which most Americans approve. Bush's attacks on big government have been discreetly aimed at the bureaucrats, red tape, and taxes that most Americans dislike. But has not taken on the vast complexes of the Pentagon, and the giant retirement programmes - Social Security and Medicare - all of which most Americans like. Bush and Gore have different schemes for reforming America's antiquated system of retirement security. But they're complicated, and they have been expressed in mind-dumbing trillions of dollars - eyes have glazed from Jersey City to Sacramento. </p> <p>As the campaign nears its close, both candidates have moved to the centre in pursuit of the 'swing' voters. Gore had condemned the easy access Americans have to guns and had called for strict gun controls. Now he avoids the mention of guns (Pennsylvania and Michigan are both toss-up states, and a lot of hunters reside in them). Months ago, Gore talked about 'working families'. Now he speaks mostly about 'middle-class families'. Early on, Bush railed against abortions. Now he stays away from this most controversial topic. </p> <p>Both men now agree on a host of things. Both say they're firmly behind a 'patients' bill of rights' which would require private providers of health care to meet minimum requirements. Both say they want to subsidise elderly Americans' access to costly prescription drugs. Both support free trade, a stronger military, and capital punishment. Bush has pushed into Democratic territory by making one of his priorities the improvement of schools attended by poor children. Gore has stepped into Republican land by promising to be so conservative with his spending that he will eliminate the national debt. </p> <p>Is it any wonder that America has ended up with a race both remarkably close and exasperatingly dull? The question is whether we have anything different in future years, regardless of how large the stakes or how important the issues? Combine the new digital technologies of direct marketing with endless campaign money, add the continued decline of American political parties once held together by ideology or class, fold in an abundance of vacuous, spin-dried, principle-free candidates, and we're likely to have larger, longer campaigns about less, culminating in lifeless dead heats. </p> <p>Alternatively, Americans may decide that they've had enough contrivance, and insist upon real candidates who will talk about real things and challenge the nation to debate its true fate. Listen carefully to the electorate and you can hear a yearning for a different kind of politics. Perhaps we haven't heard the last from the likes of a new breed of mavericks - among them Republican Senator John McCain, who mounted a strong challenge to Bush in the Republican primaries by arguing for laws to reign in campaign spending; former Senator Bill Bradley, who confronted Gore during the Democratic primaries; Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate, now Green Party presidential candidate, who has generated unexpected enthusiasm (and may divert so many votes from Gore in Oregon and California that Bush takes those states); and Jesse Ventura, the unorthodox Governor of Minnesota. Or it may be another as yet unknown candidate who shucks the technology, takes risks, and tells it like it is. </p>",
  "George W Bush said it himself: 'There must be no mistakes - I'm going to run hard all the way to the finish line. I never take anything for granted.' <p>Just as well - for his opponent Al Gore no doubt feels the same. The only certain thing about America's election in 10 days' time is that only a fool would call it. </p> <p>As Bush seemed to be stealing ahead by a nose, latest opinion polls put the candidates back on a razor's edge at 46 per cent apiece. It is the closest fought race since John F Kennedy beat Richard Nixon in 1960. </p> <p>That battle for the undecided votes at the political centre is reaching new levels of bitterness, with proliferating dirty tricks ranging from automated phone calls attacking Bush to inflammatory TV commericals suggesting Gore's Democrats are 'soft on China'. </p> <p>Both candidates, aware that the US public dislikes personalised politics, are trying to distance themselves from the increasingly vicious undercurrents. For example, thousands of phone calls to voters in Michigan carry recorded messages of women telling tales of death, illness and social neglect in Governor Bush's Texas. </p> <p>But there was also a storm of criticism of the commercial which questions Gore's resolution on defence. Based on the notorious 'daisy' spot the Democrats ran against Barry Goldwater in 1964, the commercial, being shown in swing states like Florida, Missouri and Ohio, shows a girl counting the petals on a flower and then switches to a missile countdown. The message is that the US is now vulnerable to nuclear attack from China. </p> <p>The reason for the high-octane virulence is not just that the election is close. Rather, Bush and Gore are fighting the most politically polarised election for decades, with radically different visions for America. The result will have a more lasting effect on the country and its relationship with the rest of the world than any since Ronald Reagan's time, maybe even since Kennedy's. </p> <p>Endorsing Gore last week, the New Republic magazine called it 'one of the defining ideological moments of the post-Cold War era'. </p> <p>As the two main candidates paint aggressively negative stereotypes of each other, two themes emerge: first, public distaste for negative politics, and second, the fact that the stereotypes are often accurate. Bush's demeanour, giving the impression of moderation, conceals an ideology that would eradicate the cultural - let alone political - values and legacy of the Clinton presidency, at home and abroad. Bush offers a domestic programme which, the international dimension of the Cold War apart, is brazenly to the 'right' of Reagan's. Internationally, Bush is an isolationist - in stark contrast to the man he aims to succeed. </p> <p>Gore, in turn, while making some concessions to Clinton's 'Third Way', has taken a step to the left of his mentor with a spending programme that more resembles Truman's or even Roosevelt's. Like Clinton, Gore is a passionate internationalist, and certainly the man Europe's leaders would want to see across the table. </p> <p>Talking to The Observer last week, Scott Reed, campaign manager for Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole four years ago, says: 'Time is the only commodity you cannot buy in the last two weeks of the election campaign.' </p> <p>Bush and the Republicans (who have an almost unlimited supply of money) seek, with considerable help from the Greens' Ralph Nader, to force Gore to travel in states he had assumed were his. </p> <p>Principal among these - and most alarmingly for Gore - is California, where Bush is closing his rival's 12-point lead and where Nader commands support among alternative lifestylers. Bush has his own Achilles heel in Florida, which should by rights be his (his brother is state governor), but where Gore is stealing a march among the crucial retiree vote. Gore cannot win without California, and Bush would find it hard without Florida. Otherwise, the battlegrounds are in the Midwest: Michigan, Ohio, Missouri and Pennsylvania. </p> <p>Those are the mathematics; the politics are less straightforward. At the core of the election is the fact, announced last week, that the United States is basking in the third consecutive year of a vast budget surplus - $237bn - the first time this has happened since the days of Truman. And the surplus is predicted to run to $4.6 trillion over the next decade. </p> <p>Bush's programme is a brazen one with a kernel of tax cuts, designed to cut back the growth of government and stimulate savings and investment. According to the group Citizens for Tax Justice, 43 per cent of his cuts, costing $1.3 trillion, would go to the top 1 per cent of earners, those making more than $319,000 a year. The bulk of the rest goes to the top tenth of earners. </p> <p>Few people making more than $100,000, however, would benefit from Gore's cuts, which cost $575bn and are aimed at middle- and low-income earners - part of an ambitious plan to raise their fortunes with new spending programmes and social entitlements. </p> <p>Bush assigns $48bn for education - less than half Gore's figure - and the two clash head-on over federal subsidy vouchers for parents wishing to opt out of the public education sector. </p> <p>Over Social Security and Medicare, Bush plans to create voluntary individual retirement accounts invested in the stock market, while Gore wants to leave the pension system unchanged and use the Social Security surplus to pay off the national debt and open a 'rainy day' fund for when the baby-boom generation retires. </p> <p>Gore wants to expand the government's contribution to the appalling Medicare system (albeit nothing as radical as the failed Clinton plan of 1993), while Bush aims to overhaul the system in the opposite direction, by making it compete with an enhanced private sector. </p> <p>There has been a lot of vitriol about 'fuzzy math' as Bush and Gore bark at each other over these plans, but looming over the shoulder of both candidates is the awesome prospect that the fuzziest math of all is that on which all their presumptions are made - that the surplus projections, generated by a Wall Street boom which could deflate, may be horribly exaggerated; that America's economic miracle is walking a high wire and neither will, in the event, be able to deliver. </p> <p>With a poll in Friday's Washington Post showing 64 per cent of Americans feeling they are 'winning' with the boom, few people heed the whisper of the Congressional Budget Office, which made the $4.6 trillion estimate but cautioned: 'Substantial deviation can result from incorrect technical and economic assumptions, not to mention the effect of future legislative action' - meaning, don't necessarily take our word for it. </p> <p>The CBO warns that, even under the most optimistic scenario, the cost of providing what is promised to the retired baby-boom generation will 'ultimately overwhelm the federal budget'. If the CBO has underestimated growth by 0.5 per cent, the Treasury would be $250bn short by 2010. Many voters remain undecided, and a thick fog hangs over the exchanges of 'math' and 'counter-math'. </p> <p>But the politics must share stage space with the 'beauty contest'. It is as though the US were a teenager on a date, trying to figure out which of two boys (both trying too hard) is the cutest; choosing between Bush's fluffier hair and Gore's muscles. </p> <p>Those watching on the sidelines regard the iconography of this election as between a 'moron' and a 'robot' (The New York Observer ). Gore spent the past week trying to vamp up recollections of wild college days riding motorbikes and wearing leather, while Bush has been at pains to sweep his frat-brat encounters with booze and cocaine under the carpet. </p> <p>Bush is a son and heir who never had to justify what he was saying. He has given the world 'Bushisms' even before the voting begins - saying 'hostile' when he means 'hostage', 'gracious' for 'grateful' - and to make a virtue of his own cumbersome lexicon: 'I've been known to mangle a syllable or two, if y'all know what I mean.' </p> <p>Gore has to be both lovable and lethal and cannot seem to get it right, between the nerdish desire to make sure his audience knows he knows everything - and the various other personalities and genetic modifications that his family and his spin-doctors have designed for him. </p> <p>Finally, there is the Clinton problem. Gore has claimed the mantle of Clinton's policies while keeping as great a distance as possible from the man he served. </p> <p>This week Clinton is going back on the road in Arkansas - campaigning for the deputy who will not share a stage with him. On that decision, Gore's fate may turn. </p> <p><b>Poles apart in policy and pitch</b></p> <p><b> Tax</b><br> </p> <p> <b> Bush</b>: Top 1 per cent of earners would benefit from nearly half his $1.37 trillion tax cuts. </p> <p><b> Gore</b>: Tax cuts worth $575bn with better credits for couples and carers. </p> <p><b> Social security</b><br> </p> <p> <b> Bush</b>: Voluntary retirement plan would invest 15 per cent of payroll taxes in stocks, with cut in guaranteed benefits. </p> <p><b> Gore</b>: Sweeteners for poorer women and workers, but would use social security surplus to pay off the national debt and create reserve fund for 'baby boom' cohort when it retires. </p> <p><b> Health care</b><br> </p> <p> <b> Bush</b>: Tax credits to buy health insurance, and new money for prescriptions.

  "<p><strong> Brian Masters: </strong> I wrote a biography of Marie Corelli, a Victorian novelist, and Beryl Bainbridge was on the radio saying that it should have won the prize for best biography of the year. Instead of writing to thank her, I immediately traipsed over to her home in north London and knocked on the door. Announcing myself, a voice from the kitchen beyond ushered me in. </p> <p>I was expecting a rather severe lady who was overwhelmingly intelligent. Instead, she was a down-to-earth, sensible woman, prone to laughter and extravagance, smoking too much, drinking too much. There was nothing remotely overwhelming about her. We talked for hours and found we laughed about the same things. That must have been 24 years ago. </p> <p>There's a distinction between the Beryl Bainbridge who writes these astonishing novels and the affectionate, tactile friend that she is. There's something very flirtatious about her. She makes me feel very masculine. </p> <p>Everyone else assumes I must be odd to write biographies about murderers. 'The study of mankind is man,' said Alexander Pope, and Beryl and I believe that. I'm safe with her - she knows I'm interested in the subject, not the horror. Writing biographies of murderers like Denis Nilsen and Fred West can be all-consuming at times. There have been times when I might have gone mad if I hadn't had the relief of spending time with Beryl. </p> <p>Ours is essentially an escapist relationship, although we do rely on each other for advice in our writing. Some of Beryl's subjects have been murderers or been through grim experiences, too, and she has had to imagine the experience by proxy, which is also wearying. I've helped her with the psychology of killers. </p> <p>When she's with me she lets her hair down; it's when she's alone in her study that she gets the serious stuff done. She keeps the serious part of her life to herself, she's taught me that. She might spend a day on a paragraph, three hours on a word which requires tremendous concentration and willpower. She taught me that, too. </p> <p> <strong> Beryl Bainbridge: </strong> It was back in the mid-70s and we were having supper one evening at home when there was a knock at the door. A voice said, 'It's Brian Masters', and I was most surprised that this wonderful biographer whom I had never met was on my doorstep. From that first conversation we became great friends. We talk the same language. We didn't start off tremendously literary - our parents weren't interested in that sort of thing. He's clever and worked hard, which propelled him to better circumstances. He also has an amazing gift of being friends with everybody, from aristocrats right down to the ordinary man in the street. He has many actor friends, too, which no doubt inspired his latest book, Thunder in the Air - Great Actors in Great Roles (\u00a319.99, Oberon Books, published 13 November). </p> <p>We love to laugh. He's very bright and listens with great attention. I'll take him to a local caf\u00e9 for eggs and bacon and he takes me to the Garrick Club, where we have lovely chats by candlelight. One day I was supposed to be interviewing him about something and I got terribly tiddly and couldn't remember a word of it, so I made it up. He was jolly nice about it. </p> <p>We like the same literature, drink the same whisky and are amused by the same eccentricities. We also share an interest in murder, which might seem macabre to some. Murder is the most interesting subject in the world. He explains why someone like Denis Nilsen became a serial killer and what happens during the murders, but doesn't revel in the gore. </p> <p>We gossip, too, which is fun, and we coincidentally spent a weekend together on a cruise. We had both been invited to the relaunch of a Cunard ship. We were soon popping champagne corks while discussing what happens when you boil a head on a stove overnight, which he had to study for one of his books. </p> <p>Nowadays Brian lives much of the year in France but I see him when he's in town. If something goes wrong I think to myself, I've got to get in touch with Brian. He's just part of me.</p>",
  "<p>If Al Gore had a coat of arms it ought to have a donkey with a hoof in its mouth as a prominent feature. The US Vice-President is prone to making daft statements about the internet. </p> <p>Rather like our own dear Prime Minister, come to think of it. When the Gore campaign website was first launched some years ago, it briefly included the boast that it was an 'open source' site because it welcomed ideas from visitors. </p> <p>But this was small beer compared with the Vice-President's gaffe about how he 'invented' the internet. 'During my service in the United States Congress,' he declared, 'I took the initiative in creating the internet.' </p> <p>On the face of it, this is patently absurd. The internet was not a better mousetrap that emerged fully formed from the creative imagination of a single individual. It is a complex system that was created by a whole community of scientists and engineers, not an 'invention' in the James Dyson sense of the term. Paul Baran, the chap who first conceived the idea of packet-switching, once likened the project to the building of a cathedral in which successive generations of masons build on the work of their predecessors. </p> <p>'If you are not careful,' he said afterwards, 'you can con yourself that you did the most important part. But the reality is that each contribution has to follow on from previous work.' </p> <p>So Gore is a fat-head then? Well, up to a point. If you probe beyond the faux pas to the political context behind his ridiculous claim, however, a different picture emerges. For the internet did not emerge from a political vacuum but evolved from the Arparnet, the original packet-switching network funded by the US Department of Defense in the late Sixties. And the Arpanet itself stemmed from a profound belief that government should support the kind of advanced, speculative research that private industry rarely has the vision to nurture. </p> <p>Left to its own devices, the commercial world would never have created such an amazing, permissive, dynamic, open communications system as the net, and society would have been (literally as well as metaphorically) the poorer. </p> <p>The point about Gore is that from the earliest days of his political career he understood this fundamental point - that there are some things that government can and should do because nobody else will. Indeed, that is largely what government is for. </p> <p>In a message recently published on the net, Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn (the guys who laid the foundations of the TCP/IP protocols, which define the modern net) have been pointing out that, as a congressman in the Seventies, Gore promoted the idea of high-speed telecommunications as an engine for both economic growth and the improvement of the US educational system. 'He was,' they write, 'the first elected official to grasp the potential of computer communications to have a broader impact than just improving the conduct of science and scholarship.' </p> <p>Cerf and Kahn go on to remind their readers of how, as a senator, Gore urged government agencies to merge their incompatible networks, and sponsored the 1991 High Performance Computing and Communications Act, which 'became one of the major vehicles for the spread of the internet beyond the field of computer science'. </p> <p>Coming from the men who have the best claim to have 'invented' the internet, this puts an interesting gloss on the Vice-President and the presidential campaign. An administration led by George W Bush would never have sponsored anything like the net, because Bush and his ilk cannot bring themselves to believe that big government can ever do any good. Gore knows better, which is why the US needs him more than it realises. </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:John.Naughton@observer.co.uk/\">John.Naughton@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Lock up your daughters, sons, livestock and power tools, because the floodgates are open. After decades of holding back the tidal wave of sex and violence, Britain is now undergoing a veritable frenzy of liberalisation.</p> <p>Once we took pride in our reputation as the repression capital of Europe, but virtually every film you were never allowed to see has suddenly emerged from hibernation. \"Hardcore\" porn videos can now be bought over the counter instead of over the Channel; historical scandalisers like The Story Of O, Salo and In the Realm of the Senses are all enjoying a renaissance. </p> <p>Former gore shockers like Texas Chainsaw Massacre are now material for primetime rather than municipal incinerators. Graphic sex is writhing its way onto the big screen, and the small screen too, as FilmFour prepares to broadcast Catherine Breillat's highbrow sexathon Romance in November.</p> <p>Not that any of this should necessarily be reason to rejoice. For one thing, these liberties have had to be wrested from the hands of the moral minority, and for another, not all of these films were necessarily worth banning, or watching, in the first place. </p> <p>Ever since Jack The Ripper caught sight of an exposed table leg and was impelled to embark on a Victorian killing spree, the link between provocative images and real-world side effects has taken a powerful hold in this country. Our moral custodians have unerringly erred on the side of caution, seizing anything remotely perturbing with a vigilance bordering on the fanatical, and justifying their actions legally with grey terms like \"corrupt\" and \"deprave\". </p> <p>So what's changed? About four years ago, police informed the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) that material being released as R18 (ie hardcore porn) was actually too tame to merit the description, and therefore misleading. New guidelines were half implemented, but then Jack Straw entered the Home Office and effectively reversed the process. </p> <p>A ping-pong match of appeals, refusals and judicial reviews ensued, and to everyone's surprise, the courts ruled that watching sex on TV really didn't harm many people (repetitive strain injury aside). \"We don't sit in our ivory tower and say what people should watch,\" says Sue Clark of the BBFC, which recently undertook an extensive public survey. \"We still have some of the strictest censorship rules in the world, but now we effectively accept that adults should be allowed to decide what they want to watch.\"</p> <p>So here we are, officially relaxed and eager to watch anything we once couldn't. As any record producer knows, an official ban is the best publicity one could hope for, which explains why any film with a vague whiff of scandal attached to it is now being sprung from the vaults. </p> <p>To put the record straight, though, the BBFC does not \"ban\" films. It classifies them, or doesn't as the case may be, and local authorities decide whether or not to screen them. This was the case with \"cult erotic dramas\" like The Story Of O, a kinky confection of Ferrero Rocher styling and consensual sado-masochism that caused a stir in 1975 and finally received a UK release this year. </p> <p>Director Just Jaeckin, who also directed the equally notorious Emmanuelle (which received a certificate, with cuts), has fond but vague memories of the film: \"For me, it was a beautiful story about love. It was not corrupting or pornographic, it was a fantasy, like Alice In Wonderland. But erotic, of course.\" </p> <p>While it's unlikely The Story Of O or Emmanuelle could have corrupted anyone, it's also quite a stretch to imagine that they could have aroused anyone either. Apart from crimes against interior design, the only real reason to suppress them was so that bands like Air could rip off their soundtracks undetected.</p> <p>Jaeckin's films did, however, show others the way to get sex onto cinema screens: make your film foreign and try to have some kind of plot. \"Arthouse\" has always been a way of evading the censors' scissors. Nagisa Oshima's In The Realm Of The Senses was passed in 1991 (only a 15-year wait), and the old erect-penis taboo was later lifted for Lars Von Trier's The Idiots, and Leos Carax's Pola X. </p> <p>Catherine Breillat's Romance, in many ways an updated Emmanuelle, has as many erections as an R18 film, but was passed for cinema release virtually uncut. Pasolini's Salo has fared less well. Despite impeccable arthouse credentials, its blend of perverted sex, sadistic violence and coprophilia went down as well as an excrement souffle with the authorities, despite the fact that its themes of repression, consumption and sexuality were serious-minded.</p> <p>Currently up for reclassification, it was seized by police when shown uncut at a Soho cinema in 1977 - narrowly staving off a nationwide outbreak of faeces-eating. </p> <p>The only films truly banned in the UK were the infamous \"video nasties\" of the 80s. In this instance, the Department of Public Prosecutions stepped in to staunch the Betamax bloodbath which the BBFC was powerless to stop, and prosecuted about 60 films, including future classics such as The Driller Killer, The Evil Dead and Andy Warhol's Flesh For Frankenstein (Texas Chainsaw Massacre was not on the list, although it had been refused a certificate since 1975). </p> <p>The \"but horror films are supposed to be scary\" argument didn't wash; a racy title or a lurid cover was enough (like the relatively tame I Miss You Hugs And Kisses, unwisely tagged \"for those who like their sex with a lot of violence\"). </p> <p>In the sober light of the 21st century, the majority of these low-budget splatterdramas are more hilarious than disgusting - such as Forest Of Fear, in which hippies become zombies after the FBI sprays their weed with an experimental herbicide, or Night Of The Demon, in which a victim is disembowelled by bigfoot, then whipped with his own intestines in slow motion. </p> <p>There are still many uncertified titles, some of which are unlikely to ever see the light of day, but others only remain \"banned\" because they are so bad nobody has bothered to re-submit them. Despite our new climate of acceptance, censorship is still full of contradictions. </p> <p>We are legally allowed to have sex at 16, but must wait another two years to see it on a screen. We are allowed to buy R18 videos but not receive them by mail, or bring them from abroad. And what we consider 18-certificate material, our European counterparts regularly classify as 15 or even 12. European porn producers still tone down their films for the UK market. </p> <p>Perhaps another side-effect of this liberation is the consequences for eroticism as opposed to pornography. With a rising background-smut count - thanks to increasingly sexualised advertising, television, magazines - pornography is scuttling up the hardcore ladder into bizarre, almost medical realms. If there's a relationship between what is forbidden and what is erotic, we're heading for an age of tedious sexual ubiquity, where everything is permitted and nothing is exciting. </p> <p>Perhaps we're overcompensating for all those years of repression and in a few years, as has happened with violence in films, we'll reach saturation - and start campaigning for less sex on our screens. </p> <p>Texas Chainsaw Massacre, 11.45pm, Sat, C4; In The Realm of the Senses is on limited release; Salo is showing at the ICA and NFT in London; The Story Of O is out on DVD and video on Monday</p> <p><strong>Reel shockers</strong><br>Five \u00delms the censors still don't want you to see</p> <p>Cannibal Holocaust (Ruggero Deodato, 1979)<br>The gory effects were so realistic Deodato had to go to court to prove it was fake. The ban is due to a brutal rape-murder and real-life animal killings. Makers of The Blair Witch are probably pleased since they ripped off its \"found footage\" structure.</p> <p>Snuff (Michael &amp; Roberta Findlay, 1974)<br>Argentina-made Manson family-like horror that spawned the \"oh my god, they're really killing someone!\" urban legend. In reality it was a B-grade horror (Slaughter) with a film-set killing tacked on the end.</p> <p>Straw Dogs (Sam Peckinpah, 1971)<br>Highly accomplished thriller with Dustin Hoffman declaring war on Cornwall. Overshadowed by its notorious depiction of Susan George being raped and enjoying it. The censors always had it in for Peckinpah anyway.</p> <p>Nekromantik (Jorg Buttgereit, 1987)<br>Necrophilia is a definite no-no, kinky threesomes with a corpse are positively unacceptable. And as for killing and skinning a real live rabbit, Nekromantik 2 features a particularly revolting seal autopsy.</p> <p>Boy Meets Girl (Ray Brady, 1994)<br>Low-budget torture-chamber sexual horror set in London - not as grisly as some.

  "<p>Americans in battleground states face a tidal wave of political advertising in the next 10 days. With polls looming on November 7, the parties and special interest groups are gearing up to spend a record $1bn (\u00a3696m) in televised political advertising - easily eclipsing the $600m spent during the 1996 election. </p> <p>This is the period which justifies all those political fundraising events, all those lobbying sessions and all those links to special interests. What a candidate raises over the past two years, the candidate spends on television ads in the next 10 days. And with the presidential, senate and congressional contests all on a knife edge, the incentive - and the price - of getting your voice heard is rising. </p> <p>\"Tens of thousands of dollars for 30-second ads on the public airwaves. It's outrageous,\" says the New Jersey Democratic senator Bob Torricelli, one of the most assiduous moneymen in US politics. But, outrageous or not, the parties have no choice but to stump up. </p> <p>The advertising avalanche is especially intense in places such as Philadelphia, an absolutely crucial \"media market\" for all politicians trying to get their message across to the voters of Pennsylvania and those in neighbouring New Jersey and Delaware. </p> <p>During a single hour of the local evening news in Philadelphia this week, the city's three main television channels carried no fewer than 31 political ads, each one costing an average $9,600 a minute. </p> <p>The bombardment came from all sides. An ad for the Pennsylvania attorney general ran five times. The rival candidates for the Delaware US Senate election each had slots. A Republican group ran a couple of attack ads against the Democratic Senate runner in New Jersey. George W Bush and his supporting Republican special interest groups had five ads of one kind or another, while Al Gore and his Democratic supporting groups had seven. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, the stations are laughing all the way to the bank. \"We're booked through the election,\" says Dave Davis of Philadelphia's WPVI. Last month alone, it took in $7.9m for the 2,600 political ads that it aired - and that was before the election hotted up. </p> <p>WPVI's sales chief, Bernard Prazenica, calls the demand for ad time \"breathtaking\". Candidates will even take slots at 2am or 3am, such is their desperation to be heard. \"They'll take anything.\" </p> <p>\"The big winners of the closest race in 40 years are going to be the television stations in the battleground states,\" says Daniel Weiss of the Sierra Club, a pro-Gore environmental lobby. </p> <p>Mr Weiss has just discovered that the price of a 30-second advertisement in Portland, Oregon, has tripled since the beginning of October. </p> <p>Advertising time in Michigan, another intensely fought state this year, has shown a similar rise. A prime slot which would have cost $3,500 now costs $12,500. </p> <p>The advertising binge is entirely localised, and is concentrated in the states where the big contests are tightest. In St Louis, Missouri, you will be deluged with political ads. But switch on in Washington DC and all you will get is advertising for the Virginia senate race. Here, in the safest Democratic stronghold in the US, the presidential campaigns do not need to spend a cent. </p> <p>The spending frenzy is especially focused on the programmes watched by the target voters. Almost by definition, the much sought-after independents do not watch political programmes or the news. They watch soaps and game shows, the programmes with the most expensive advertising slots. In Philadelphia, slots on Who Wants to be a Millionaire can cost $22,000. </p> <p>The ads that will win or lose the elections are already bought and booked. Which is perhaps why the new Republican ads which ran yesterday in Wisconsin, Oregon and Washington are important. </p> <p>The ads feature Ralph Nader, the Green party candidate who is more liberal than Mr Gore, attacking the vice-president. Mr Nader could snatch enough votes from Mr Gore in six key states and tilt the vote in favour of Mr Bush.</p>",
  "George W Bush has surged to a 13-point opinion poll lead over Al Gore with just 10 days to go before the US presidential election on November 7. <p>Mr Bush, the Republican nominee, is on 52%, with the Democrat, Mr Gore, now trailing on 39% in the latest Gallup daily tracking poll for CNN and USA Today. The Green candidate, Ralph Nader, has 4%. </p> <p>The new poll means that Mr Bush has benefited from a three-point swing in the past 24 hours, a remarkable boost by any standards. In Thursday's Gallup poll, Mr Bush was on 49% with Mr Gore 42% and Mr Nader 3%. </p> <p>Yesterday's 13-point margin is Mr Bush's biggest lead over Mr Gore since before the party conventions in August. </p> <p>If the Gallup poll is correct - and some experts think it could be a rogue result of the kind that shows up in any campaign - Mr Gore would seem to face an almost hopeless task with only 10 days before election day. </p> <p>The Republicans, meanwhile, stand on the threshold of regaining the White House after eight years of Bill Clinton's presidency. </p> <p>The accuracy of the Gallup finding was challenged last night by the polling director of the Washington Post, which is conducting its own daily tracking polls, similar to the Gallup survey. The latest Washington Post survey showed Mr Bush with a much narrower 48%-45% lead over Mr Gore, while a third tracking survey for Reuters/MSNBC showed Mr Bush on a slim one-point lead. </p> <p>\"All I can say is I would love to be tracking the election that Gallup is tracking,\" said Richard Morin, the Post's polling director. \"It's a lot more interesting election than the one I'm looking at. I see something far more stable than the Gallup numbers suggest.\" </p> <p>But a separate Gallup survey for Time magazine today also showed Mr Bush with a clear lead, 49%-43%, over Mr Gore, with Mr Nader on 3%. </p> <p>All three tracking surveys produce rolling results based on the last three days of daily surveying. Each day's new result is obtained by adding the latest day's sample and discarding the four-day-old segment. </p> <p>Such tracking polls have become increasingly prominent in this year's Bush-Gore contest because of what has otherwise been an exceptionally close and volatile race. Mr Gore led by 46% to 45% in Gallup's tracking survey as recently as Tuesday. </p> <p>The fluidity of the closest presidential contest in decades was underlined by a series of state-based polls which brought some comfort to all the candidates. Mr Gore campaigned yesterday in Pennsylvania where a poll gave him a five-point lead. Mr Bush, meanwhile, was in Michigan, where the two men are in a virtual dead heat in the state which could ultimately tip the balance. Meanwhile, Mr Bush was eight points up in Ohio, a local poll suggested. </p> <p>Mr Nader's increasing importance was underlined by a poll in Minnesota that showed him holding the difference between the two frontrunners. Mr Bush had a 41% to 38% lead over Mr Gore in the always independent-minded state, with Mr Nader on 10%. </p> <p>The increasingly tense and bitter final stages of the election were marked yesterday by an extraordinary off-message move by supporters of the Bush campaign in Texas, who began airing a television advertisement implying that Mr Gore would lead the US into a nuclear conflict with China. </p> <p>The ad, which is modelled on a celebrated 1964 commercial which did much to destroy the presidential campaign of the Republican presidential candidate, Barry Goldwater, in his contest with Lyndon Johnson, shows a young girl picking the petals off a daisy as a nuclear explosion occurs. It began running in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida yesterday. </p> <p>The commentary claims the Clinton-Gore administration \"sold\" America's security \"to Communist red China in exchange for campaign contributions\". </p> <p>Mr Gore claimed the ad was \"another personal attack\" by Mr Bush's supporters. A campaign spokesman for Mr Bush disavowed the ad.</p>",
  "George W Bush and Al Gore are locked in the closest US presidential election since 1960, and campaigns don't come any closer, or any dirtier, than that one. <p>According to most opinion polls, John Kennedy and Richard Nixon were dead level at the end of the party convention season. Then, after the four presidential debates in September and October, Kennedy inched slightly ahead. </p> <p>In the final days of the campaign, however, President Dwight D Eisenhower began to campaign for Nixon, and Kennedy's narrow lead began to be eroded. </p> <p>The campaign was marked by a barrage of dirty tricks on both sides as Kennedy and Nixon used their underworld connections and their money to try to swing the election. </p> <p>Both sides dug for dirt. The Kennedy camp was on the verge of releasing a story that Nixon had regularly attended parties with prostitutes at the Florida home of his friend Bebe Rebozo when they discovered that Kennedy had been a visitor too. </p> <p>The FBI director, J Edgar Hoover, slipped the Nixon campaign several files on Kennedy's sex life, including the rumour that JFK had a secret first marriage: a revelation which would have been devastating to the Catholic Kennedy. </p> <p>Ironically, in light of Nixon's later career, the Republicans were convinced that Kennedy had bugged their telephones. Nixon himself later claimed that Robert Kennedy, John's younger brother and later his attorney general, was the worst. \"He illegally bugged more people than anyone. He was a bastard.\" </p> <p>John Kennedy, no slouch in the political black arts himself, was no less outspoken. In the final week of the campaign he told his speech writer Richard Goodwin that Nixon was \"a filthy, lying son of a bitch, and a very dangerous man\". </p> <p>The role of organised crime in the election continues to intrigue new generations of investigators. At the time the Chicago mafia boss Sam Giancana, who shared a mistress with Kennedy, bragged that JFK \"wouldn't even be in the White House\" without his organisation's intimidation at the polls in Illinois. </p> <p>The result of the 1960 election was the tightest in modern times: Kennedy became president with 49.71% of the popular vote, compared with Nixon's 49.55% - a margin of 113,000 votes from a turnout of nearly 69m voters. </p> <p>To his dying day Nixon believed that 1960 was the stolen election. Dirty tricks were alleged in several states, notably Illinois, Missouri, New Jersey, Texas, and West Virginia. Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago - the father of Al Gore's campaign manager, Bill Daley - famously told Kennedy late on election day: \"With a little bit of luck and the help of a few close friends, you're going to carry Illinois.\" </p> <p>The turnout in Chicago in 1960 was an amazing 89%: nationally it was only 63%.</p>",
  "<p>When the last great hacking scandal broke in February, there were gloomy predictions in the United States about the vulnerability of companies to such attacks. Time magazine reported that the government was fearful of \"some future electronic Pearl Harbour\". </p> <p>Philip Bobbitt, the former national security council senior director for infrastructure protection, warned ominously: \"We're entering a period when a very small number of persons can do greater damage to our American infrastructure than all our previous wars combined.\" </p> <p>Mr Bobbitt was speaking before the latest electronic break-in at Microsoft, but what has happened bears out the fears - if in slightly less apocalyptic terms - that industrial espionage at such key companies as Microsoft is becoming a reality. </p> <p>Gaining access to Microsoft's source code would be like obtaining the secret ingredients of Coca-Cola. It is the fount of Microsoft's huge success and monopolistic grip on world computers, more than 95% of which have an operating system (mainly Windows) designed by Microsoft. </p> <p>The company's policy has been to integrate its operating system with other popular applications such as the Excel spreadsheet and Word wordprocessing package (also providing Microsoft with a market share of around 95%) to expand its firm grip on the market. </p> <p>Critics complain that Microsoft's integration of applications with its operating system stifles competition because a rival company could not invent a new spreadsheet and give it away free - in order to be successful, it would have to displace Excel, which has become a world standard. </p> <p>In recent years Microsoft has been using versions of its operating system to expand into other fast-growing areas such as cable television (where it has been buying minority stakes), palm-top computers and mobile phones. In Europe, its chief competitor in the mobile world is Symbian, part owned by Britain's Psion which yesterday warned that its profits would be well down on market expectations. </p> <p>Another success for Microsoft is Internet Explorer, which has long since dis placed Netscape Communicator as the leading internet browser. </p> <p>At the heart of Microsoft's success is the intellectual property rights it asserts over the source code to its operating system. Its main rival is Linux, the operating system devised by devotees around the world which can be downloaded for free from the internet. Although it has had some spectacular successes in professional applications (particularly running servers), it has never made any impact against Windows run on personal computers. </p> <p>Microsoft's dominating position, its often arrogant attitude and its claims to have a high level of security have made it a prime target for hackers. In the past 12 months its Hotmail subsidiary, one of the most successful emailing companies, was subjected to a spectacularly successful hack, and its Explorer browser was exposed as having security holes. </p> <p>But the most worrying aspect of this is undoubtedly the fact that it has happened on this scale at all. If a company such as Microsoft - which probably has the densest concentration of intellectual firepower of any large company - can fall prey to hackers, can anything be safe? The answer, in a word, is no. </p> <p>The break-in could not have come at a worse time for Microsoft, still embroiled in its long-running and expensive anti-trust battle with the government. The battle has even had ramifications on the presidential election, with Al Gore visiting Microsoft's home state of Washington to try to woo back the company's workers and families who feel bruised by the way the government has behaved, thus helping to turn the normally Democrat state into a marginal. </p> <p>It was only on Wednesday that Microsoft's lawyers and those representing the US government joined in raising concerns about plans to conduct a computer seminar for the US appeal court judges who have to sit in judgment on the break-up of the company. </p> <p>Microsoft and the government have both requested a preview of what the instructor, Michael Hites, a computer technician from the Illinois Institute of Technology, intends to tell the court, fearing that Mr Hites might unintentionally stray into some of the key appeal issues. </p> <p>But the greatest concern to Microsoft is the implications of the break-in. Previously, the hacker as a figure had been regarded mainly as a nuisance, albeit a disruptive and costly one. Many of the most spectacular acts of hacking have been aimed at proving a point and have not been done as acts of commercial theft. </p> <p>\"The media's obsessive focus on computers and the extraordinary growth of electronic commerce on the internet has led to a 'dumbing down' of the terms used,\" Kevin Mitnick, the world's most celebrated computer hacker wrote in the Guardian earlier this year. \"The media now uses 'hacker' to describe crimes using computers and 'hacking' is now a pejorative used to label those crimes.\" </p> <p>Mr Mitnick spent four and a half years in jail for his hacking activities, although none of them were for commercial gain. He has always argued that the FBI and government have concentrated their attention on the wrong targets and the latest break-in might prove his point. </p> <p>Microsoft yesterday confirmed the hackers had accessed its source codes but denied that they had tampered with them. </p> <p>A British security expert said yesterday that the hackers may well have needed inside help. Former det supt Graham Satchwell, Microsoft's senior investigator in Europe, the Middle East and Africa until last month, said: \"If this was not a case of a 17-year-old hacker getting lucky and actually a case of organised crime then they would need someone on the inside.\" </p> <p>So, just when Microsoft would have wanted to be using its fire-power in its legal battle, it is having to mount a public relations exercise to deal with the damaging implications of commercial espionage. </p> <p>The great irony is that the hackers have accomplished what the US justice department has been unable to do: get access to the company's source code. The other irony is that Microsoft will have to work the FBI at a time when it is crossing swords with a different branch in its anti-trust case. </p> <p>The fact that the presidential campaign is at its height may prove a blessing - diverting attention from Microsoft's current embarrassment.</p>",

  "President Vladimir Putin forged stronger bonds with the new Yugoslav president, Vojislav Kostunica, in Moscow yesterday, soothing his resentment at Russia's initial refusal to acknowledge his first-round election victory. <p>Much of Mr Kostunica's brief working visit was dominated by the question of energy supplies to Yugoslavia, which the Russian gas giant Gazprom suspended earlier this year when its debts mounted to \u00a3280m. But the underlying purpose of his first significant state visit outside the Balkans was bridge-building. </p> <p>Russia's relationship with its long-term ally was bruised by its prolonged indecision over how to respond to the election standoff. </p> <p>The Yugoslav democracy movement was enraged by the Kremlin's soft line on the defeated incumbent, Slobodan Milosevic, and Mr Kostunica criticised Russia's fence-sitting in the days after the election. </p> <p>Yesterday's meeting secured better relations, and the two leaders reached an agreement on restoring energy supplies, which should boost Mr Kostunica's support at home. </p> <p>Mr Putin praised Mr Kostunica for his handling of last month's turbulent events. \"You were able to escape the difficult situation without bloodshed and led your country out of isolation,\" he said. </p> <p>He promised to help secure Yugoslavia's re-entry to international institutions, and called on other states to help boost its shattered economy. </p> <p>\"The international community is obliged to do everything to restore the country's economy,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Russia is ready to participate in this.\" </p> <p>Mr Kostunica said Mr Putin backed Belgrade's opposition to independence for Kosovo. </p> <p>Borislav Milosevic, half-brother of the former president and Yugoslav ambassador to Moscow, was not present at the talks. He was called to Belgrade earlier in the week for \"consultations\", the embassy said.</p>",
  "Kosovo will take a step closer to a final break with Yugoslavia when it holds its first democratic elections today. <p>The pro-independence Kosovan Albanian parties will sweep the board in the polling for municipal authorities, which will be almost totally boycotted by the few remaining Serbs. </p> <p>Thousands of peacekeeeping troops will guard the 1,464 polling stations to prevent trouble. In an effort to minimise intimidation and corruption, more than 1,000 European monitors have been drafted in to support 3,000 local observers. </p> <p>The Kosovo Albanians' overwhelming support for independence is a problem for the US, Britain and other Nato members, which are hoping for a reconciliation between Kosovo and the newly elected government in Belgrade. The west is afraid that any further fragmentation in the Balkans will create instability. </p> <p>Hashim Thaci, the former leader of the Kosovan Liberation Army (KLA), who now heads the PDK (Democratic Party of Kosovo), said at a rally in the capital, Pristina, on Thursday: \"On Saturday, it is up to you to give an answer to the dilemma of the final status of Kosovo ... your vote will put an end to the Serb dream of returning to Kosovo.\" </p> <p>The more moderate Ibrahim Rugova, the leader of the LDK (Democratic League of Kosovo), who is likely to emerge with the biggest share of the votes, also stressed that the only solution to the Kosovan problem was a speedy move towards independence. He called for today's poll to be followed quickly by elections for an assembly and president - de facto independence. </p> <p>Richard Holbrooke, the US special envoy, said such elections would be held soon, but a UN spokeswoman said it was too early to say if they would be held in the spring. </p> <p>Despite the replacement of the hated Slobodan Milosevic as president of Yugoslavia by the more conciliatory Vojislav Kostunica, who called this week for the poll to be postponed, the demand for independence has increased. </p> <p>Party political broadcasts have been unequivocal, showing footage of fleeing refugees and Serbian police entering Kosovo Albanian villages, a reminder of the events that led to Nato's intervention last year. </p> <p>Kosovo is still recovering from that war: many buildings in Pristina are still wrecked from the Nato bombing, there are frequent power cuts, the roads are pitted and communication is irregular. </p> <p>The biggest problem remains lawlessness in a country with one of the highest concentrations of guns in the world. The judicial system is biased against Serbs; crime and corruption are endemic. </p> <p>The PDK, which has many members who fought in the KLA, and close links with organised crime, has control of many towns and villages. The UN is braced for bloodshed if it refuses to hand over control of any municipalities it looses.\"The behaviour of the PDK is the big question,\" a western diplomat in Pristina said. </p> <p>The run-up to the election has been relatively peaceful by Kosovan standards. There was a grenade attack on Thursday, and a suspected incident of arson. Earlier in the week there was a power cut as Mr Rugova rose to deliver a speech at a rally. One of the main causes of tension is the Kosovo Albanian flag. The UN said it could not be shown at polling stations. </p> <p>Almost a million Kosovo Albanians have registered to vote, and about 1,000 Serbs. In one exclusively Serb area, Zvecan, only 23 people - all Serbs - have registered to vote in 17 wards. To try to circumvent the boycott the UN administrator in Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner, will appoint Serbs to some municipalities. </p> <p>There are no reliable opinion polls but Mr Rugova's LDK is forecast to emerge as the biggest party, Mr Thaci's PDK second and Ramush Haradinaj's AAK (Alliance for the Future of Kosovo), also pro-independence, third. </p> <p>There is little difference between their programmes, most of the debate focusing on their roles in the past 10 years: Mr Thaci argues that his military option was more successful than Mr Rugova's passive resistance.</p>",
  "<p>BT came under further pressure yesterday after Oftel announced new price controls which should cut domestic telephone bills by \u00a3270m a year by 2002. </p> <p>David Edmonds, director general of Oftel, rejected BT's argument that price controls were no longer needed. \"BT has argued that price controls should be removed because of the extent of retail competition. Oftel does not believe that this can be justified at this time.\" </p> <p>Mr Edmonds plans to extend the present price-cutting controls, which are due to run out in the middle of next year, for at least another 12 months. In addition he is forcing BT to make bigger reductions in the prices it charges other operators for the use of its network. </p> <p>At present BT has had to reduce these interconnection charges by the retail price index, or RPI, minus 8%. Mr Edmonds plans to increase this to RPI minus up to 11.5% over four years. He said the move would allow other operators to offer lower prices by passing on the saving to customers. </p> <p>BT said it was disappointed by Mr Edmonds' decision to maintain price controls. The group has six weeks to persuade the regulator to change his mind. </p> <p>A BT spokesman said Oftel was proposing price cuts of between 7.5 and 11.5 percentage points below the rate of inflation. BT is having to reduce prices by RPI minus 8%; he said that anything tougher would be \"pretty challenging\". </p> <p>The group, which recently parted company with its finance director, Robert Brace, is trying reduce its borrowings by the flotation or sale of subsidiaries or minority interests. </p> <p>Its attempt to secure a third-generation mobile phone licence in Italy collapsed this week. </p> <p>Operators such as Energis and Colt, which use BT's local network to deliver calls to customers, would benefit from the Oftel proposals. </p> <p>BT argues that, although it has a virtual monopoly of this local loop, many of the lines are unprofitable. </p> <p>In the more profitable markets it has seen its share whittled away. It now handles only 25% of international business calls and two-thirds of residential international calls. Mr Edmonds warned BT he would impose tougher controls if prices did not fall. </p> <p>\"Oftel estimates that the average bill for a residential customer has reduced by about 20% in real terms over the past three years due to price controls on BT and greater competition from indirect access suppliers and cable operators. </p> <p>\"The introduction of carrier pre-selection from January 2001, which will enable consumers to use alternative carriers for the voice calls without dialling additional digits, is also likely to have a significant effect on competition.\"</p>",
  "<p>Hardly surprising, a football reporter wrote at the weekend, that Brighton FC - now second in the English third division - should be on song, when they have in their ranks players called Rogers and Hart, plus a sub called Crosby.

Yet it's perfectly clear that Wenger won't take it, since he prefers to stay at Arsenal while Hodgson seems to be a case of mistaken identity. It is no good dreaming of Alex Ferguson either. Why ruin a record of huge success by taking on England? That leaves only Sven Goran as a genuine runner. As to the rest of the field, Smallweed's frequently impeccable sources suggest that the list looks like this: </p> <p>\u0095 Sven Goran Persson, Swedish prime minister and a notable conciliator. It is thought he might even persuade Teddy Sheringham and Andrew Cole (as Andy Cole is nowadays known) to speak to each other. </p> <p>\u0095 Sven Goran Ivanisevic, tennis player. Only those who could pronounce his name would be considered for places in the England squad, thus raising its intellectual level by several Melvyns. </p> <p>\u0095 Sven Gore'n'Joe Lieberman. A bit too busy at present but may have bags of time on their hands after November 7. </p> <p>\u0095 Sven Gali.

B est lines of the week - 1. \"I do tend to fall in love with exceptional brains\" - Erica Jong, the Guardian, Thursday. </p> <p> In a piece in the Sunday Times, the writer and hunting-obsessive John Mortimer reported an incident at a dinner party involving his wife Penny and the Labour public opinion guru Philip Gould. According to Mortimer, Gould remarked to Lady M: \"He really is getting old, isn't he? Why do you stay with John? Is it love or duty?\" </p> <p>This is the second time I have seen this story: the other was in an interview with Penny herself in the Daily Telegraph on September 23. They found themselves, she said, placed next to each other at Chequers, she said, and Gould began to question her about how John had managed to \"brainwash\" her into supporting his campaign on hunting. \"He's getting very old, isn't he?\" she reported Gould as saying, to which she replied; \"Well, he's 75 and getting a bit dicky in the leg department, but I can assure you that his brain is firing on all cylinders.\" </p> <p>Gould's response, according to her, was to say: \"Why do you stay with him? Is it love or duty?\" \"I was flabbergasted,\" Lady M told the Telegraph. She wished now that she had replied: \"It's neither, it's just great sex . . . But that's not something you would know about.\" </p> <p>Perhaps this is what comes of running too many focus groups. </p> <p> The origin of the term \"white knight\", beloved of the city pages, has not I fear been resolved by my blundering inquiries so far. Theories continues to reach me by email, carrier pigeon and extra-sensory perception. Here is another. The Rev Ben Humphries of Preston writes: \" think that it has become the shortened reference to the rider, or knight on a white horse, the first of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse, mentioned in chapter 6 verse 2 of the Revelation of St John, also known as the book of the Apocalypse, in the Bible. This rider 'rode forth conquering and to conquer'. In chapter 19 verse 11, the white horse appears once more; its rider's name is Faithful and True, for he is just in judgment and just in war'.\" I must say my dealings with city folk make that reference to faithful and true seem pretty conclusive. </p> <p> Best lines of the week - 2. \"For a writer steeped in Herodotus and Plotinus to have been reviewed by those who have read neither must be galling.\" - Erica Jong, on Gore Vidal, a man with a sky-high Melvyn quotient, the Guardian, Thursday. </p> <p><strong> JH Judge (Worplesdon, Surrey) writes:</strong> Let me try again.

  "Germany had just surrendered, the war against Japan was still going on, London and many other British cities were covered in rubble. But John Maynard Keynes wanted the country to know that those who cared about such things were taking steps to ensure that the brave new postwar world would not only have new social and economic policies, but something hitherto unheard of in British history: a cultural policy. <p> \"I do not believe it is yet realised what an important thing has happened. State patronage of the arts has crept in. It has happened in a very English, informal, unostentatious way - half-baked. A semi-independent body is provided with modest funds.\" It was with these words that listeners to the BBC were informed in July 1945 of the creation of the Arts Council. The tensions which were to dog the Arts Council throughout its history were evident in the very terms of Keynes's celebratory remarks. 'Access' was to be in competition with 'excellence'; culture was at once lodged in the past as 'heritage', but also located in creative and participatory activities in the present.</p> <p> And aims were mixed in other ways, too: Keynes spoke of the need \"to make London a great artistic metropolis\", but also pledged the new body to \"let every part of Merry England be merry in its own way\" (the grand-opera-plus-morris-dancers view of 'culture'). The only really unequivocal statement was Keynes's cry from the heart interjected in the middle of his broadcast (and which no official spokesperson for the arts would dare to utter these days): \"Death to Hollywood.\"</p> <p> The history of the Arts Council is important not just because it became the main funding body for the arts, but because it functioned as a kind of microcosm of the relation between politics and culture in Britain in the second half of the 20th century. At first, the 'culture' it fostered largely corresponded to the traditional tastes of the cultivated elite; then in the 1960s and 70s, it attempted to do right by various forms of 'popular' culture; finally, in the 1980s and 90s it fell in with the prevailing economism of public discourse, treating culture as one of the 'leisure industries' which contributed to the GNP - or as the Thatcher-appointed Arts Council chairman, William Rees-Mogg, put it in 1985: \"The arts are to British tourism what the sun is to Spain.\"</p> <p> These developments were conditioned by social attitudes towards culture which had deep historical roots. Summarising ruthlessly, one might say that the dominant tradition in Britain had been an uneasy mixture of indifference, suspicion, and the largely unreflective perpetuation of the tastes of the traditional upper class. It has often been argued, most influentially by Matthew Arnold in the mid-19th century, that the pervasive impact of Protestantism, especially in its Puritan form, and the power of the commercial middle class in the world's first industrial nation combined to produce a suspicion of, or resistance to, culture that deserved to be called 'philistine'. But Britain's traditional elites, too, contributed to this uneasy relationship. The court and the metropolis were less the focus of upper class cultural life than in some other European countries; the landed classes tended rather to be provincial in their attachments and rural in their pursuits. </p> <p> It is true, of course, that historically most of the 'high art' forms were dependent upon the patronage of the wealthy classes, but in Britain even these were (and perhaps still are) primarily pursued as conventional elements in an established social season: where a visit to the opera at Covent Garden might be seen in much the same light as a cricket match at Lords or the regatta at Henley. This in turn helped to fortify popular hostility to these art forms and, although the labour movement's high regard for education has left its monuments in the statute-book in the form of public provision of schools and libraries, the arts have only attracted limited attention from the chief reforming governments of this century. </p> <p> Seen against this historical backdrop, the long absence in Britain of any kind of 'Ministry of Culture' is hardly surprising. In place of a 'cultural policy', Britain has had a miscellaneous collection of cultural institutions, with varying degrees of status and public support, whose operation has depended upon the shared values, social contacts and tacit agreements among leading members of the social and professional elites. Anything more explicit or systematic threatened to grate on those British sensibilities which detected a totalitarian resonance even to the phrase 'Ministry of Culture'. As Lord Goodman, the then Chairman of the Arts Council, drily remarked in the 1960s: \"One of the most precious freedoms of the British is freedom from culture.\"</p> <p> Prior to the second world war, the only public provision of culture took the form of the central government's responsibility for certain major museums and art galleries. The first steps towards the public provision for 'the arts' were prompted by a concern for the morale of the civilian population during the conflict itself. The Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts was set up in 1940; it was initially intended both to assist people to perform music and drama for themselves and to make the work of professional performers more widely accessible, though the latter aim soon predominated. In 1945 the warm glow of victory led many wartime expedients to be looked upon with favour, and all political parties concurred in transforming CEMA into the Arts Council. The establishment of the Arts Council may have represented a significant extension of the 'range' of activities receiving public support, but the 'means' adopted conformed to an established British pattern.</p> <p> The guiding principle remained that of 'arm's length' administration: that is, a system where public funds were not disbursed directly by a government department, as in most other European states, but were allocated to intermediate bodies which were charged with fulfilling certain public obligations - usually phrased in very general terms - and then left free to disburse the funds as they saw fit. </p> <p> As far as Westminster and Whitehall were concerned, both the level of political attention given to the arts and the size of the sums involved remained negligible for at least the first two decades after 1945. But then in 1965 the Labour government signalled its intention of pushing the topic up the political agenda by appointing a junior minister with special responsibility for the arts. In practice, subsequent governments, especially Conservative ones, tended to resist any expansion of the power and prestige of this office: the Arts portfolio was shuffled around various ministries, never commanding a ministry of its own, and so the minister concerned was in a correspondingly weak position when negotiating with the Treasury for an increase in its spending powers. </p> <p> Until 1992, the Arts Minister headed the Office of Arts and Libraries; it was a junior post which did not bring membership of the Cabinet. Inevitably in recent decades, with the heightened political profile of conservation and 'heritage' issues, with the greatly increased political clout of the 'tourist industry', and with the alleged economic benefits of a thriving 'arts sector', numerous issues which might in other countries be classified as the responsibility of the Ministry of Culture have come under the supervision and sometimes the control of government. But administratively these responsibilities remained dispersed until very recently. Thus, the Foreign Office oversaw the work of the British Council, the body whose task is to disseminate British culture abroad. The Department of the Environment was responsible for various historic buildings and other sites of national interest. The Home Office had overall responsibility for radio and television, though the cinema fell under the Department of Trade and Industry, while the Office of Arts and Libraries was administratively in the charge of the Lord President of the Council, having previously been under the Department of Education and Science.</p> <p> Some may see in this a wise Burkean system of internal checks and balances in which no one department has a monopoly of 'cultural policy'; others may see it as a characteristic muddle, only tolerated because the British have traditionally not taken 'culture' seriously enough to merit the formulation of effective procedures and policies for its support. From its beginnings, the Arts Council was subject to criticism from various quarters, especially on the grounds of its being too 'elitist' and taking too narrow a view of its functions. But there were also mounting misgivings about the way in which the council operated, and critics on both the left and the right of the political spectrum urged that its freedom be curtailed (generally urged by the right) or its constitution be altered (generally urged by the left). Neither the process of appointment to the main council and its panels nor the funding decisions they took were open to any kind of democratic control: much appeared to depend upon the close social links between members of the metropolitan elite.</p> <p> In this vein, it has been suggested that the reason why the independence of such bodies as the Arts Council involved no great tension with successive governments until the 1980s was that the members of these bodies so deeply shared the attitudes and values of the traditional political class. In the 1960s and 70s, as part of wider social changes, the council came under pressure to take a more democratic or popular view of the cultural activities that should be funded. To a limited extent the council did extend the range of its clients, though one of the main consequences is that it came under further criticism from Tory backbenchers who complained that public money was being used to support 'indecent', 'subversive', or simply 'mediocre' artistic activities. In fact, it is clear that for some time now the Arts Council has uncomfortably juggled various, not always consistent, criteria in making its decisions. </p> <p> In the mid-1980s, under Rees-Mogg, it thumpingly declared its commitment to 'excellence', but taken narrowly this was always bound to conflict with the council\u00cds duty, as laid down in its charter, \"to increase the accessibility of the arts to the public throughout Great Britain\". The relative autonomy accorded to the Regional Arts Councils further complicated the picture, since they tended to look more favourably on a variety of 'community' or participatory activities than had the parent council. Although the big cultural satrapies such as Covent Garden, ENO, the National Theatre and the RSC were always its major clients, the overwhelming bulk of the support provided by the council was in smaller grants to a huge variety of organisations - dance companies, local theatres, individual writers, poetry magazines, crafts associations, and so on. </p> <p> The Thatcher governments of the 1980s exercised one obvious kind of influence by their reductions in the real value of the arts budget, but they also exercised a more insidious influence by manipulating the system of appointments to the relevant public bodies along simple partisan lines. Thus, for example, in 1980, shortly after the Tories had taken power, the self-made businessman Alastair McAlpine was nominated for membership of the Arts Council. There was immediate protest, since not only did McAlpine have no obvious qualifications or experience in the arts world, but he had already noisily expressed his opposition to any public subsidy to the arts. The protest was overridden by the arts minister's revelation that \"this nomination comes from a very high source\"; McAlpine has been one of Mrs Thatcher's closest supporters and a fervent advocate of 'free-market' policies. </p> <p> Then in 1982 Richard Hoggart, a literary and cultural critic with a distinguished career in education (and a man of moderate Guardian-reading leftwing views) who had for some years served very effectively as vice-chairman of the Arts Council, was abruptly dismissed. This was contrary to established practice and against the stated wishes of the chairman and the rest of the council. When pressed, the (Tory) arts minister confessed it was because \"Number 10 doesn't like him\". Rees-Mogg was appointed as chairman the following year. When Roy Shaw, the long-serving secretary-general of the Arts Council, retired later the same year, he wrote an article for the council's Bulletin regretting this increasing politicisation of appointments. Rees-Mogg attempted to prevent the publication of the article, which only led to its receiving vastly greater publicity by its appearance in the Observer. </p> <p> The official view in the closing decades of the century was that any shortfalls in public provision would soon be made up by private sponsorship, but the problems with this assumption have become increasingly clear. Sponsorship is another form of advertising, and thus introduces its own demands, whether in the form of opera programmes printed in the colours of a well-known cigarette company or, more worryingly, of pressures towards 'safe' and uncontroversial events. The one new ministry set up by John Major after his election victory in 1992 was the Department of National Heritage, embracing tourism, sport and the arts. The title aptly reflected the prime minister's sepia-tinted views: village greens and country houses are part of the nation's 'heritage', experimental theatre and minimalist art are not.</p> <p> In practice, what really transformed the relation of government to the arts were the huge yields from the new national lottery. The capital infrastructure of culture became heavily dependent on what Adam Smith famously described as \"a tax on ignorance\"; regular funding channelled through the Arts Council was now only part of the story. After Labour's victory in 1997, the title 'the Ministry of Culture' was finally established. It retains broadly the same heterogeneous remit, which reflects the current deep confusion about the distinctive nature and value of art. In so far as there is an organising principle, it is economic: these activities are grouped together as a category of 'optional' consumer choices, they are 'leisure industries'. By the end of the 20th century, costume dramas had become the emblematic 'product', milking heritage to help the export drive. 'Death to Hollywood' has mutated into 'long live Merchant Ivory'.</p> <p> Broadly speaking, therefore, what has happened is that one, largely extraneous and inherited, form of confidence has been eroded without being replaced by another which would allow discriminations of quality to be persuasively made on intrinsic rather than merely instrumental grounds. We are now encouraged to think of works of art not as expressing some of the deepest probings of the human condition, but as leisure products whose 're-branding' will contribute to 'national competitiveness'. While this is the prevailing official ethos, we had perhaps better hope that the familiar lack of a 'cultural policy' in Britain continues, thereby at least allowing a little genuine creative expression to be fostered in the cracks.</p> <p> <b> What the men in suits said about the state of British culture:</b><br></p> <p><b>1946</b><br> \"By provision of concert halls, modern libraries, theatres and suitable centres we desire to assure our people full access to the great heritage of culture in this nation...
