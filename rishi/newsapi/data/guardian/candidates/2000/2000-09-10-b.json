  "Al Gore is walking tall into the final eight weeks of the US presidential election safe in the knowledge that America's women are solidly behind him. According to a new poll, the race between Gore and George W. Bush is now polarised along classic lines with men supporting Bush 52 per cent to 38 per cent, while women support Gore by an identical margin. <p>Gore's lead among women is a remarkable turnaround, that has helped place him neck and neck with Bush in the race for the White House. It appears to owe much to the single most powerful image of the campaign so far - that of his 4-second 'lip-lock' with wife Tipper at the Democratic Convention last month. That kiss, described by many commentators as embarrassingly sustained, signalled the retirement of Al Gore, the staid, overly-serious Washington insider and the emergence of the new Al - a passionate family man with the interests of all women at heart. </p> <p>The election itself may now turn on The Kiss. Not only did it signal a man committed to family values without overtones of religious stridency but it helped to distance Gore from the less familial pursuits of his boss, Bill Clinton. </p> <p>And underlying the imagery, of course, is strategy . Until the convention, Gore was struggling to personify issues close to women whose votes will be critical in November. </p> <p>That has now changed. Gore, buffed up and tanned instead of waxy, has emerged more comfortable in his new role as 'political winner'. He has not only closed the 'character gap' but is credited in polls for running a cleaner campaign while Bush, who earlier in the race was comfortably ahead with women, is struggling to appeal to this key constituency with his education and health policies. </p> <p>Last week Bush unleashed a series of tougher TV ads, and swapped his wilting campaign slogan 'A Reformer with Results' for the pithier 'Real Plans for Real People'. Bush too has assumed the mantle Al Gore once called his own. This time last year, at Hallowe'en, Al dressed up as The Underdog for the costume party he and Tipper traditionally throw in Washington. It's a costume George W. has decided is rightfully his. 'I am the underdog - I sure am,' he said last Thursday. 'But I was underdog when I first started. Nothing's changed about underdog status.' It was a statement that could barely conceal its pretence - as one designed to appeal to women. </p> <p>But some observers suggest that despite his firm appeal to women in Texas (he received 67 per cent of their vote when he last ran for governor), the macho image of that state does not play well with women elsewhere. Bush strategist Ray Sullivan counters: 'He has been reaching out to female voters from the start. Gore managed to bring them back into his fold at the convention but the governor will continue to talk about issues important to women.' </p> <p>New polls show that the contenders are locked in a dead heat at 47 per cent each. Of greatest concern to Bush is that the loss of his lead over Gore - as much as 8 per cent in July and into double digits between the conventions - may not be a capricious reaction to his recent gaffes but instead reflects a hardening attitude against him. </p> <p>Only twice since World War Two has the race been tied at this stage: in 1960 between Kennedy and Nixon, and between Carter and Reagan in 1980. But it is Gore's ability to tune into the interests of women that stands as his most radical transformation. Earlier this year he was widely ridiculed for hiring feminist advocate of female sexual power Naomi Wolf to help him become an 'alpha male', a Darwinian role his boss, Bill Clinton, had no trouble assuming even to his political detriment. </p> <p>At the time, the hiring smacked of desperation but nevertheless established Al and Tipper's 27-year-old daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, as his most important adviser and cheerleader. It is said that while Tipper does not like politics, Karenna is fixated on strategy and tactics. </p> <p>It is Karenna, with blonde good-looks and winning smile who has taken on the public role of humanising her father, encouraging him to offset his intellectualism with displays of emotion. She is an expert at casting a new spin on his political vulnerabilities and has been described by Gore as having 'nearly perfect pitch' when it comes to political advice. Officially, she runs the youth wing of his campaign, Gorenet, but unofficially has her fingerprints all over his campaign and is credited with encouraging him to move his campaign HQ to Tennessee, a move designed to distance Gore from the image of being the political incumbent. </p> <p>Gore-Schiff has also encouraged him to talk about his family life. Last week at a rally in New Orleans, Gore welcomed Dr David Kline, the neurosurgeon who had operated on Gore's son Albert Gore III in 1989 after he was hit by a car in Baltimore and severely injured, and thanked him profusely. </p> <p>Finally it is, perhaps, Tipper who may emerge as Gore's most powerful asset. Her well chronicled weight problems and her bouts of depression make her seem more real with American women than any recent First Ladies. Her lack of overt political aspirations or policy agendas for the White House are also in stark contrast with Hillary Clinton. Tipper's winning move, however, has been to show the women of America that she has achieved one ambition they all share - to keep her husband enchanted after 30 years of marriage.</p>",
  "<p>We were lucky. We managed to cross the Channel in the interval between the fishermen's blockade and the disruption caused by the French truck drivers. This was in spite of chancing a detour to Colombey Les Deux Eglises, the home of General Charles de Gaulle, where one was reminded that even the great man himself had problems with the French when they took to the streets. </p> <p>Our only traffic problem in France was at the Italian border, where we spent an hour waiting to pay the toll at Ventimiglia. It makes you wonder about the wisdom of the road-pricing system. On the other hand, despite a grim warning at Ventimiglia that we faced a suspiciously precise 127 kilometres of French traffic jams ahead, the jams simply vanished on one of the busiest Saturdays of the year. Perhaps the French had all stopped for dinner. </p> <p>Notwithstanding France's little local difficulties over the price of petrol (and such difficulties are no longer confined to France) I am reminded whenever I travel to the Continent that, in the end, I am on the European side of the great debate. While I was standing with a European official next to a French war memorial, he paused, pointed and said: 'Brussels bureaucracy has to be better than this.' </p> <p>But one cannot disregard the serious economic difficulties involved for Britain. </p> <p>The big question for those of us with such concerns is: what happens if it comes to a question of either in - or out altogether? It is admiration for European standards of social protection that drives TUC general secretary John Monks's support for the euro, as Robert Taylor makes clear in his interesting new book on the unions, The TUC - from the General Strike to New Unionism (published by Palgrave). And it is interesting that many former members of the Left now see social salvation in Europe. </p> <p>While we are on the subject of the Left, an analyst of European affairs observed recently: 'Perhaps New Labour would not be quite so unpopular if Tony Blair had to look over both shoulders, as most continental leaders do.' </p> <p>The brilliance of Sir Edward Heath's leadership was in taking Britain into 'Europe' without a referendum. De Gaulle had said 'no' to Britain after answering his country's call to return from Colombey Les Deux Eglises; Heath got on well with President Pompidou, as is clear from his memoirs, and from the publication last week of a fascinating historical document Britain's Entry into the European Community - Report on the Negotiations of 1970-1972 by Sir Con O'Neill' (Frank Cass). </p> <p>When reminiscing at the Foreign Office launch of the book last week, Heath lamented the fact that the 'momentum' of our relationship with Europe was adversely affected by the 1973-74 oil crisis. That crisis not only hit all the major industrial economies badly, it also affected the fate of their political leaders. Heath himself was brought down by a miners' challenge to his authority that would probably not have occurred if the rise in the price of oil had not tempted domestic producers of energy to flex their muscles. </p> <p>There are some uncanny parallels between today's concerns about the price of oil and the crisis of the mid-1970s. It is fashionable to argue that things have moved on, that we are less dependent on energy thanks to the conservation efforts induced by previous oil crises. It is also true that there are still massive reserves of oil around the world. Nevertheless, when I hear world leaders pleading with the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) to be 'more responsible', I tend to think like Gielgud's character in Harold Pinter's play No Man's Land : 'I've known this before.' </p> <p>Perhaps the most interesting parallel is between all the 'New Economy' rubbish we have been subjected to over the past year, and the feeling, in the early 1970s before the oil crisis, that the prospect was one of indefinite, healthy, synchronised economic growth throughout the world. </p> <p>I recall the OECD economist John Llewellyn (now with Lehman Brothers) telling me during the earlier oil crisis: 'We have tended to take energy for granted, but energy is different from other economic inputs.' </p> <p>For much of the recent US boom, the economy was doing no more than matching earlier historic economic performances. Certainly the lat ter phase of the boom had a lot to do with investment in new technology; but it also received an enormous boost from the collapse of oil prices. </p> <p>An important reason why the macro-economic picture around the world has been so good recently is that policymakers have been able to run the economy with little or no inflationary threat. What is happening in the oil market is a serious warning that there could be trouble in store. The cheapness of 'gasoline' in the US is quite amazing, largely because energy taxes are negligible by European standards. </p> <p>The market works - but in matters of oil exploration and development the market works slowly. A US economic adviser once said that an economist's time lag is a politician's lost election. An oil price of $10 was absurdly low, but one in the $30 to $40 range and possibly rising is a serious challenge to the view that the good times are here for ever. </p> <p>Behind all the technical arguments about oil stocks, and the political wrangling, lies the simple fact that, as in the 1970s, demand has for the time being outstripped available supply.</p>",
  "<p>Are you a Bobo? A bourgeois bohemian? Bobo is a word you won't yet find in any dictionary, the happy inspiration of an American journalist, David Brooks, author of Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got There (Simon &amp; Schuster) and it springs from Brooks's observation that it is no longer as easy as it used to be to distinguish between the bourgeois world of capitalism and the bohemian counterculture. </p> <p>Once, if you were bourgeois, you wore a dark suit, probably worked for a corporation, and had life insurance. If you were bohemian, you were an artist and an intellectual, and knew about the avant-garde. Bohemians wore blue jeans and championed the values of the liberated Sixties. Your average bourgeois was the gung-ho yuppie of the Eighties and the Age of Greed. </p> <p>Interestingly enough, both 'bourgeois' and 'avant-garde' are words that have, of late, rather dropped from the lexicon. And, to finish with Brooks's insight into the way we live now, the bohemian and the bourgeois are all mixed up. </p> <p>You cannot, he says, readily distinguish an espresso-sipping professor from a cappuccino-gulping banker. More, he argues that these bobos are a new \u00e9lite that combines the values of the countercultural Sixties with those of the high-achieving Eighties. These, he says, are the people who now set the pace, and the tone, of American society. Their hybrid culture has infiltrated all walks of life, and all areas of mass consumption. He doesn't say this, but Democratic presidential hopeful Al Gore is Bobo-in-Chief with his support for the internet and the environment. </p> <p>Brooks is clever, but he's not intellectual, and he's not much exercised by the phenomenon he's describing. 'I just went out,' he writes, 'and tried to describe how people are living, using a method that might best be described as comic sociology.' </p> <p>Brooks is writing about America, and very entertaining he is, too, in a Wolfe-ish, O'Rourke-ish, Buckley-esque sort of way. Equally troubled by a similar changing of the guard in Britain, but much less enjoyably so, is George Walden, disappointed man and former Tory MP. The New Elites: Making A Career in the Masses (Allen Lane \u00a318.99) is a lengthy and rather muddled whinge about what Walden sees as a new oligarchy of professional egalitarians, and their populist 'corruption' of the pure well of British culture.</p> <p>That's not all. Where Brooks is judgment-light in his assessment of Bobo values and freely admits that 'Max Weber has nothing to worry about from me', Walden is a prodigious name-dropper. A blizzard of allusion - to Kierkegaard, Flaubert, De Lillo, Arnold and William Morris - assails the reader in the first 20 pages. Shortly after, Walden abandons the quasi-journalistic tone of his opening and launches into a mini-lecture about 'the so-called classical \u00e9litists' Vilfredo Pareto, Robert Michels and Gaetano Mosca.</p> <p>Although later he loosens up to take on the Dome, Channel 5 and the Booker Prize, here, in a nutshell, is the fundamental problem with his book. Briefly, it never decides whether it's an opinionated polemic against Tony Blair's New Labour establishment or a Tocquevillean treatise about representative democracy in the age of mass media. A prevailing tone of withering contempt ('To every fool is given his morsel of wisdom') and the absence of index, bibliography or footnotes tells us that Walden sees his efforts as essayistic.</p> <p>Simultaneously, the sophomoric references to Fourier, Heidegger, Kundera, Nietzsche and Koestler remind us that Walden wants to pass, at least in Conservative circles, as an intellectual, an author of gravitas and learning. Or, as David Brooks might put it, he seems to want to be both bohemian and bourgeois. Some candid friend should take him to one side with a quiet word about the difficulty of being at once racy and respectable. </p> <p>Walden's complaint about the crassness of contemporary cultural endeavour in the age of New Labour is more bilious than Brooks's but in other respects he is part of a trend, at least in Britain. These past few weeks have seen the publication of a number of grumpy jeremiads from a grouch of retired and/or deposed culture tsars, each of whom wants to say that in the age of the Bobo our culture is going to hell in a handbasket. </p> <p>Next to Walden, there's John Tusa's Art Matters (Methuen \u00a312.99) which feuds with Melvyn Bragg while wringing its hands over the cretinisation of cultural life. Another former BBC man, John Drummond, has also pitched into the fray with some spinsterish remarks about Nigel Kennedy in his door-stopping memoir Tainted by Experience (Faber \u00a325). </p> <p>The difficulty with taking this apr\u00e8s nous, le d\u00e9luge stuff seriously, as Professor John Sutherland recently pointed out, is that these writers are all into their bus pass years. Why doesn't some enterprising Bobo publisher commission a lively New Labour journalist to critique the supposed cultural crisis from a position of knowledge, sympathy and understanding? </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:robert.mccrum@observer.co.uk\">robert.mccrum@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>They play in pristine white, they have won the European Cup more times than any other club, and they stand for everything that is currently wrong with football. </p> <p>Real Madrid begin their Champions League defence at Sporting Lisbon this week, days after admitting they are a crippling \u00a3170 million in debt. The Spanish giants are always in debt, but it appears the acquisition of Luis Figo, Pedro Munitis and Flavio Conceicao has undermined their tottering financial structure to the point where not even their celebrated friends in influential places can shore it up. </p> <p>'The situation is bad,' the new president, Florentino Perez, admitted after an audit revealed even more of a money pit than had originally been feared. 'We have a grave sickness and it is a miracle the club is surviving day to day.' </p> <p>He can say that again. It's a miracle football is surviving day to day with such an irresponsible role model. For it could be argued, indeed it should be argued since it is palpably true, that Real do not pay silly wages and play expensive games of oneupmanship with Barcelona in isolation. Their behaviour has a knock-on effect on the rest of the game. Barcelona went straight out with their Figo money and bought Marc Overmars and Emmanuel Petit from Arsenal, who were then obliged to pay over the odds for Sylvain Wiltord. Look at the money Liverpool had to come up with to try to tempt Steve McManaman to stay. Real are paying McManaman \u00a33.4m per year even though they don't want him. Every club with a decent player approaching the end of his contract has to take a deep breath and consider what Real might pay him. Yet Real cannot make their own sums add up. </p> <p>For a club who have won the Champions League twice in the past three years, Real are far from a picture of health. It is not just their overdraft either, although financial recklessness is at the root of most of Real's problems to such an extent it must gratify more prudent operations like Manchester United. Considering Real are still the most glamorous, impossibly romantic, football team on the planet, the way they have conducted themselves in recent years has been diabolical. This is the club to which every daydreaming schoolboy aspires, but grown-up footballers are finding the reality is distastefully different. </p> <p>With the exception of Figo and the other newcomers, no one at the Bernabeu really knows whether they are staying or going, whether they are wanted or not. Rumours of a wholesale clear-out refuse to go away. 'The players have been left isolated and ignorant,' said former player and coach Jorge Valdano, who has just been taken on as sporting director. 'We need to support them and redefine their situations, so they can concentrate on playing and not be driven mad by different versions of the truth.' </p> <p>This would be par for the course at an underachieving club like Internazionale or Barcelona, but it is only four months since Real were on top of the world. Their stylish and thrilling success is fast becoming a memory though, for every time Real achieve the prize they crave they promptly break up the band. Two years ago, manager Jupp Heynckes was sacked and given \u00a31m compensation within eight days of their victory over the more fancied Juventus in the final in Amsterdam. </p> <p>This time Vicente del Bosque has survived, although it looked touch and go at times last season, but the best midfield in the Champions League has been ripped apart. Fernando Redondo was packed of to Italy, Steve McManaman cruelly hung out to dry. The reason is either bad management or chronically poor accounting. Perez has had to raise \u00a352m in four separate bank loans in three months since taking over - the first tranche was necessary to pay players' wages owing from June. </p> <p>The big plus for Real fans is supposedly the arrival of Figo and his even bigger wages to simultaneously beef up the attack and put Barcelona's nose out of joint, though there are signs that the Bernabeu faithful are becoming tired of the capricious nature and sheer financial irresponsibility of the club. Figo was bought at record cost principally to honour an election promise made by Perez, who did not make it clear at the time that this extravagant purchase with money Real did not possess would effectively involve the sacrifice of the heart of last season's winning team. </p> <p>Perez denies the club went out on a limb for Figo, arguing that most of the \u00a338m fee was raised by the sale of Nicolas Anelka and Elvir Baljic. But that explanation hardly covers the unseemly haste with which Redondo was sold to AC Milan. Admittedly, \u00a311m is a good price to pick up for a 31-year-old, but the Argentine was at the top of his form, extremely popular with Real supporters, and had just been voted the most valuable player in last season's Champions League by Uefa. </p> <p>In recognition of his distinguished service for Real and his excellent form last season, supporters understood the club had placed an unofficial 'Not for sale' notice on Redondo, and were surprised and upset when he departed so quickly. A club statement explained the apparent u-turn by saying it was the player's 'express wish' to join Milan and that he had always wanted to end his career in Italy. Redondo himself has denied this, however, and supporters remain suspicious. </p> <p>McManaman could never claim to be a club stalwart in the way Redondo was, but perhaps for that reason his treatment has been even more squalid. Indeed, it is hard to see how anyone can get to become a club stalwart if teams like Real are going to cynically exploit the Bosman ruling and make a quick buck on players who cost them nothing. There is not much more you can ask of a foreign player in his first season at a club than to settle into the side after a change of manager, play an integral part in helping reach a European Cup final in Paris and score a goal when he gets there. But do Real appreciate McManaman's contribution? Not unless trying to sell him to Middlesbrough against his wishes can be construed as a compliment. </p> <p>Again, the club's almost desperate need to raise cash overlooks the fact that McManaman has proved himself a valuable member of the side. The manager has disputed this, describing McManaman as 'surplus to requirements' and doing his best to dishearten the player. The club president has even less interest in McManaman's welfare, undoubtedly viewing him merely as a potential source of income, but fortunately the Real supporters still know what's what. </p> <p>When McManaman made his first appearance of the season as a substitute for Figo in a friendly against Santos last week, he was given a standing ovation by 35,000 fans at the Bernabeu. Perhaps they admire his Scouse pluck in standing up for his rights, more likely they know their club is once again in the wrong. 'I'm not in confrontation with Macca,' an uncomfortable del Bosque was forced to admit afterwards. 'It's great that the crowd love him.' </p> <p>You can see why Valdano talks of being driven mad by versions of the truth. It is like when Perez says the only way to raise the \u00a3200m or so the club need is to convert into a limited company, only to dismiss the notion because the members would never stand for it. In point of fact, keeping Real as a members' club was another of Perez's election promises, and the idea that investors would flock to support such a financial black hole is risible in any case. Selling the training ground is more realistic. Until then, Perez will operate 'crisis measures'. </p> <p>'We'll go through two difficult years until the club is restructured,' he said. So don't expect Real to rush out and buy an expensive short-term replacement for injured centre-forward Fernando Morientes. Well, not for a week or two.</p>"
