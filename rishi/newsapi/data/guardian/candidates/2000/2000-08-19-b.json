  "Down in the mosh pit, while Al Gore was midway through his coming-out speech, two of his aides slapped a high five; his young and idealistic speechwriter, Eli Attie, and seasoned, cynical 'message guru', Carter Eskew. <p>'I stand here tonight,' Gore had just told the electrified crowd, 'as my own man'. It was the moment of the passing of the torch, the handover of the leadership of the Democrat Party - and maybe the White House - by the President who had stolen the show on Monday night. His deputy and political 'son' was now delivering the most important speech of his life. </p> <p>To the delight of Gore's audience and the surprise of many, he rose to the occasion with a declaration of war in a time of peace; with impatience at a time of prosperity and content. Naomi Wolf's 'Alpha Male' had broken free. </p> <p>The speech was unabashedly populist, a class-conscious battle-cry crafted to forge an abyss between himself and his opponent, George W. Bush, who next day accused Gore of 'class warfare'. Gore cast Bush as a defender of 'powerful interests', while he would champion the 'working families of America'. </p> <p>It is a high-risk strategy, which enlivens the struggle against Bush. This now becomes - issue for issue, brick by brick - the most politically polarised election since Ronald Reagan's. </p> <p>'The presidency,' said Gore, 'is more than a popularity contest' - a dig at Bush and, in its way, at Clinton too - 'it is a day-to-day fight for people. There are big choices ahead and a shopping list of reforms in education, health-care, social security, law and order, and our whole future is at stake ... We have got to win this election.' This was not a 'new' Al Gore, but it was - as one of his close aides said - 'as good as he gets', when it mattered most. </p> <p>Gore took a big gamble last week in Los Angeles. He was forced into it not so much by his own convictions as by the most contorted and complex heredity ever bestowed on a politician - a miasma of personal and political relationships. </p> <p>Talking to The Observer after the speech, one of Gore's closest aides said: 'It's been so incredibly complicated - like a family fraught with relationships and loyalties pulling and pushing him in all directions. Clinton, Hillary, Monica, the whole White House thing.' </p> <p>Foremost among those relationships is that with the President, out of whose long shadow Gore had to emerge if he was to live up to the declaration of independence that Attie and Eskew (among others) enjoyed so much. </p> <p>Last week Clinton cast two contradictory shadows over his prot\u00e9g\u00e9: his lambent valediction on Monday night, and the news, leaked on the day of Gore's speech that Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr's successor is considering re-opening the Monica Lewinsky wound. </p> <p>The President had promised not to step into Gore's spotlight, but he could hardly help being himself. Everyone agreed that Clinton's farewell address was a star performance. </p> <p>Far from setting the stage for Gore, Clinton staked his own personal claim of credit for America's good times. This is something Clinton has always felt he was due, but not granted, as his obsession with his legacy swings between three moods: contrition, whimsical melancholia and Monday's charismatic self-satisfaction. The mood swings are fast and frequent. Last week Clinton went before the cameras to clutch the hand of a tele-evangelist, describe his embarkation upon a 'new life', beg forgiveness for his 'terrible mistakes' and implore the public not to blame Al Gore. </p> <p>Meanwhile, staff in the West Wing talk about Clinton's 'dark moods', which often permeate his speeches in lines that resemble those of an emperor who has seen through his own game of power play - such as, 'in 200 years' time, all of us will have been forgotten'. </p> <p>Then came Monday: Clinton's contrived but effective gladiatorial walk down a tunnel leading to the stage, his shining smile and defiant response to what he took to be a personal affront from George Bush - the notion that he had somehow 'squandered' economic opportunities. It takes that kind of wound - coupled with a sense of occasion - to bring out the magic in Bill Clinton. </p> <p>All three moods in the Clinton bequest created different and complex challenges for Gore last week. Gore had to maintain his distance from the Lewinsky scandal, but needed also to claim some reward for his part in Clinton's roll-call of achievement. On the other hand, he had to do this in a way that enables him to appear as a leader, not a perennial number two. </p> <p>He also needed to find his own manifesto - it would not be enough to promise more of the same - especially because Bush thinks that is his line. </p> <p>There were other pressures too, not least from an even longer shadow across American politics than that of Clinton, and an even more illustrious name - Kennedy. The note sounded by that name was a loud one in Los Angeles last week: it was exactly 40 years ago in LA that John F. Kennedy was nominated by the Democratic convention, announcing the 'New Frontier' in an epic speech which defined the politics and aspirations of a generation. </p> <p>In the year 2000, the bridge between Clinton's big night and that of Gore's began with the remarkable appearance of four Kennedys during Tuesday, notably the secretive Caroline - sole survivor of JFK's immediate family. Her rare, elegant address was a high water mark of the convention, recalling her father's life and death, and saying: 'Now we are the New Frontier, and now that many of us are doing so well, it is time once again to ask more of ourselves. Much as we need a prosperous economy, we also need a prosperity of kindness and decency.' </p> <p>The leader of the clan, Senator Ted, followed with a coded manifesto for everything that he - as guardian of the party's left wing - believes the Clinton administration should have done but did not, mainly in healthcare and social security. </p> <p>In an interview with The Observer , the heir to Camelot - Patrick Kennedy, son of Bobby - said he found it 'surreal' to have his relatives take the stage in this way. 'This is not the real world here,' he said. Now in charge of the Democrats' fundraising, Congressman Kennedy added that 'politics is not about the kind of charisma that my father and uncle had; it is about hard work, everyday hard work'. </p> <p>But all these Kennedy conversations and addresses had one striking feature in common: Clinton was not mentioned. Four decades on, the name Kennedy represented the liberal ideals that Clinton is thought, by the party's left, to have abandoned, or at least sidelined, and which now lodged their claim - from among the party base, at least - with his successor. </p> <p>The challenge to Gore was to balance this claim - and the need to secure his own, still not conquered, party base - against the battle for the centre-ground votes and the 'undecideds', among whom he trails Bush. </p> <p>Faced with this labyrinth of complex and contradictory challenges, the stakes were higher than the expectations when Gore took the podium on Thursday to take President Clinton's baton. In the event, Gore took a gamble. </p> <p>He forged what may emerge as his own brand of unashamed populism, which combined some of Clinton's centrism with a decisive step to the left of the President he has served. </p> <p>At a time when a largely contented electorate shows little taste for political confrontation, Gore laced Clinton's 'New Democrat' vision with more than a touch of the 'Old'. He blasted big oil, big insurance, big tobacco and big everything in bellicose language that belonged more to Franklin Roosevelt's party of the Thirties than that which Clinton returned to the presidential office eight years ago. </p> <p>Gore focused not on what the Clinton administration has done, but what it left undone in the lives of those whom pundits call the 'K-Mart voter', whom Gore promised to champion and characterised as 'people trying to make house payments and car payments, working overtime to pay for college and do right by their kids'. Out of the 5,100 words in his speech, only one of them was 'Clinton'. Twenty were 'fight'. </p> <p>At times, Gore's description of the political landscape even felt like a speech from opposition, rather than from the deputy leader who had painted it. </p> <p>Indeed, George Bush was quick to spot this on Friday, saying that the 'laundry list' of Gore's proposed reforms 'seems like a reflection on past failures'. </p> <p>In his best lines, Gore conceded that he appears 'a bit of a policy wonk' and 'won't always be the most exciting politician', but offered a stark contrast to Clinton with a pledge that: 'I will never let you down.' </p> <p>The list of commitments on children, health insurance, education, guns, abortion and crime was a strident and often ambitious one, and, echoing Caroline Kennedy, Gore promised to 'challenge a culture with too much meanness and not enough meaning'. </p> <p>In the aftermath of the speech, those around Gore were happy, but wary of the electoral task to which this rhetoric now commits them, and those on the left were pleasantly surprised. </p> <p>Harold Ickes is the Democrats' left-wing Svengali figure and a long-time foe of Gore (he privately believes Gore cost him the post of Chief of Staff). He conceded to The Observer: 'It was good. The last quarter, very good.' </p> <p>George Stephanopoulos, a key strategist in both Clinton presidential campaigns, who left Clinton's White House disappointed, told The Observer he thought 'Gore did a good job. Great speech. It's what we've been waiting to hear from him'. </p> <p>The early polls suggest that America broadly agrees, but the test will come over the next few days. One source close to Gore said that the team felt the 'springboard effect of the convention has to bring Gore within three points of Bush, otherwise we're in big trouble'. </p> <p> <b>The style file: Gore and Clinton</b><br></p> <p> <b> William Jefferson Blythe Clinton IV </b></p> <p><b>Born: </b> 19 August, 1946, three months after his father died.

  "<p>Two words were not being spoken much at the Democrat's convention in Los Angeles: 'Monica' and 'Willard'. Monica needs neither introduction nor explanation, but Willard maybe does; it's the name Bill Clinton gave to his penis, according to another of his women, Gennifer Flowers. Clinton's reasoning: 'It's longer than Willie.' </p> <p>Meanwhile, in Malibu, a few miles up the Californian coast, Willard has been on the mind of one of Hollywood's most intriguing stars. Indeed, Willard is the protagonist in Joe Eszterhas's latest book, American Rhapsody , America's current number four bestseller. </p> <p>Eszterhas is the only movie screenwriter to attain and equal the superstardom of Tinseltown's actors and directors. He has had many famous and infamous ideas during his career walking in and out of Hollywood's portals, looking inside out and outside in. The best known is the 'pussy shot' of Sharon Stone crossing her legs while wearing no knickers in Basic Instinct . </p> <p>But even this was unambitious compared to American Rhapsody , which had political and movie-making circles holding their breath during the months before it was published. It's a hilarious and scandalous book, part-fact, part-fantasy, about a serious subject: Washington observed through the prism of Hollywood and vice versa. </p> <p>The Sharon Stone episode is there in full, along with a string of other fantasies that portray the actress as a dope-smoking, power-obsessed manipulator. Almost the entire Hollywood establishment is treated in the same way: Richard Gere, Michael Douglas, Warren Beatty, Gina Gershon, Glenn Close; many more are named and shamed as vain and self-obsessed. </p> <p>Writs were expected to fly as soon as the book was published and although no one has sued, Stone's agent, for one, has not ruled out action. At Knopf, the book's American publisher, the lawyers were sufficiently concerned to write a 30-page memo. In Britain two publishers have turned it down after taking legal advice. </p> <p>At the heart of American Rhapsody is an outrageous but astute portrait of Bill Clinton as America's 'first rock'n'roll President'; the man who ran the White House as a Hollywood mogul. </p> <p>'Politics has become entertainment,' says Eszterhas, 'and entertainment has become politics. Betty Thomas, who made Private Parts and Dr Dolittle, said that comedy in Hollywood was now \"funny moments with liberal inserts\", and that is right, because Sixties liberals and political correctness have taken over the industry. And the inner dynamics of Hollywood are like politics. Say you give a script to a group of executives - they all sit around, afraid to voice an opinion, saying nothing, waiting to know what the consensus is. Just like focus groups, opinion polls or a cabinet. Meanwhile, politics is about getting a candidate in front of the public as a star, politics as rock'n'roll, politics as a movie.' </p> <p>These mutually reflective prisms are a product of the cult of rock'n'roll, as epitomised by Eszterhas's own progression from Rolling Stone to Hollywood and now the innards of the Clinton scandal. 'I always wanted to be a rock'n'roll star,' admits Hollywood's highest-paid scriptwriter, 'and so did we all. So did Bill Clinton. Fact is we went on to do other things. But we still wanted to do our success like rock'n'roll stars.' </p> <p>That's why Bill should come to Hollywood, as he is urged to do in the pivotal chapter of American Rhapsody , 'Bubba in Pig Heaven'. 'You've got to move out here, Bubba - Hollywood is the place for you - this place reeks sex from its cellular pores. A townful of sluts on the make, Willard-friendly and experimental, bored with ham-and-egg, Al Gore orgasms.' </p> <p>Eszterhas's point is best illustrated by the knotty problem that dominated a year of American politics: the status of oral sex. Blow jobs were central to the Lewinsky scandal. Bill Clinton insisted that blow jobs do not count as sex; much of America agreed. Eszterhas assures the President that oral sex is what manicure girls offer in Hollywood as a matter of routine; they are 'a little break in a busy afternoon', just as they were for Bill in the Oval Office. Same for rock stars in between make-up and the stage. And that's the whole point: 'This is the permeation of rock'n'roll into everything,' says Eszterhas. </p> <p>He was born in Hungary in 1944, the year the country's Jews were rounded up and sent to Auschwitz. 'I've studied the Holocaust extensively,' he says. 'It's my lifelong obsession.' His family fled when the Red Army cut a swathe across the country, as far as Austria, where the boy and his parents were moved from camp to camp by British and American military authorities. </p> <p>After the war, they moved to the rust-belt town of Cleveland, Ohio, where his father edited a Catholic-Hungarian newspaper. Young Joe knew little English, but learned quickly enough to graduate and get a job on the Cleveland Plain Dealer , for which he interviewed Jimi Hendrix. He was obliged to leave the paper, however, after causing it to lose a libel suit to the tune of $16,000, a colossal sum in 1971. At that time, there was only one magazine that would give a home to a man who had developed a lifestyle propelled by a mix of drugs, booze and his Willard (by his own admission). He joined Jan Wenner's Rolling Stone and from there made the move to Hollywood. </p> <p>'I remembered what Hemingway said,' recalls Eszterhas. 'He said, \"Stop at the California state line, don't do it; it'll break your heart\". I decided not to stop and not to let it break my heart.' </p> <p>His first script, which got him into an immediate fight with Sylvester Stallone, was 'Fist' . 'It was 300 pages long. A page a minute - that's a long movie, and that's how little I knew.' At the time, Eszterhas said: 'I have always been fascinated by the corruption of power.' </p> <p>Eszterhas lives in a house on the ocean-front of the Malibu Riviera. Bob Dylan is a neighbour. The greeting is warm and relaxed; his kids charge around covered in sand and seawater. The sofas are decorated with Native American designs and the walls are a shrine to the Sixties: a picture of the Beatles signed by George Harrison; Muhammad Ali; Robert Kennedy. His own scripts - Jagged Edge , Music Box , Telling Lies in Hollywood , Sliver , Basic Instinct - share shelf space with the complete works of Charles Dickens. </p> <p>Eszterhas's wife, Naomi, moves as graciously around this m\u00e9nage as is possible for someone who has given birth to a fourth son, Luke, just two days before. They are blissfully happy, 'but it took me 50 years to get there,' says Eszterhas. Their meeting is a story in itself: Sharon Stone ran off with Eszterhas's friend, Bill McDonald, who duly deserted his wife, Naomi. As an act of friendship, Eszterhas and his wife, Geri, decided to take Naomi on a break, only for the screenwriter and the jilted wife to fall in love. 'If someone asked me if I introduced Bill and Sharon deliberately to get hold of Naomi, I'd say, subliminally, I'm sure they're right.' </p> <p>When most American writers call themselves 'outsiders', one is sceptical. With Eszterhas, you know it's more than partly true. 'I was six when we came to this country. When I was 14 or so, I still had a lot of trouble with it. I saw my father humiliated countless times in limitless ways. Every time I saw that happen, I was thrown into full-blown hysterics, like a two-year-old. I find myself with an immediate understanding of people who are on the outside, the Jews, whatever colour or creed they are. The showgirls, gays and outcasts.' </p> <p>In Hollywood, Eszterhas has done many out-of-the-ordinary things, but one above all. He has made the usually hidden figure of the screenwriter into someone not only visible but also bankable. 'I have only one loyalty - to my writing. I never wanted to be the head of a studio or a producer,' he says. 'I just wanted to make sure that what I write is what appears on screen, to not have some idiot change it on its way to the screen. There sure as hell are some idiots in Hollywood. Complete morons.' </p> <p>This attitude has led Eszterhas into some famous scraps, victories and defeats. It led to his fight with one of the most powerful titans in Hollywood, Mike Ovitz, when Eszterhas left Ovitz's Creative Artists empire to rejoin the agent with whom he originally worked in Hollywood, 'and who gave me my break' - out of loyalty. 'I'm the only sucker in Hollywood to be accused by Ovitz of disloyalty for doing something loyal,' he shrugs. </p> <p>His greatest triumph, he says, was protecting the coda scenes of both Jagged Edge and Flashdance from 'going to the wall in the hands of the directors'. His biggest failure, he says, was the loss of control of a script dear to him, 'written with my friend, Richard Marquand, who later died. It was about an escaped convict and the relationship he had with children. The script was taken and destroyed many years later by Jean-Claude Van Damme as Nowhere to Run . It lost its sensitivity, it lost everything. I don't like to remember that movie.' </p> <p>His favourite among his own movies is Music Box , in which Jessica Lange plays an attorney defending her Hungarian father against accusations that he was a collaborator with the Nazis and a war criminal. It was the most serious film to establish the hallmark Eszterhas theme - that everyone has a past, and that it is not always the past you want people to know about. </p> <p>It was a theme he returned to in Showgirls , which he admits is the least favourite of his own films. In the film, a girl escapes a life of prostitution to join a dance troupe in Vegas. The film contained an infamous rape scene, 'which we should not, I feel now, have shown, although I do insist that to show such a scene does not imply any complicity in it. I worry that we are approaching a time when that which is shocking is squeezed out by the Stalinism of political correctness. I think the messenger was slain for the message. It's against the tyranny of political correctness that American Rhapsody is an assault.' </p> <p>The book took shape after the failure of Showgirls and the sudden convergence of other movies. 'Every time I flicked channels, there I was, talking. I was talking too much and writing too little. So Naomi and I went to Hawaii. The phone was cut off and we lost touch. This gave me the chance to have a good think about my life.' </p> <p>On his return to Los Angeles, the Lewinsky scandal was in full bloom, and Eszterhas became addicted and immersed. 'I had in mind to do a piece for Rolling Stone , but I had no idea that it would become an obsession and a 1,000-page manuscript. Maybe as a writer I was getting hemmed in by scripts. I felt like someone let out of jail and going berserk.' </p> <p>Apart from Bill, Monica and the political cast, the book singles out Sharon Stone for treatment. Eszterhas claims to have 'created' Stone and to have been her lover. He feels a 'proprietary interest' when he hears about the friendship between Clinton and Stone. She was 'Bill Clinton's ideal woman' and 'every bit as political as he', given that 'a star's career is a lifelong political campaign'. She had 'ascended her star on the strength of her privates, but had handled the challenge well'. </p> <p>'I just had this idea that Bill and Sharon wanted to get together and should have got together,' explains Eszterhas. 'But Bill would not have got away with what Hillary has let him get away with. Not only would he have had scratches on his nose, but Sharon can be quite lethal with an ice-pick.' </p> <p>Does he have it in for Sharon Stone? Eszterhas puts on his sincere face. 'Of course not. Who would? She is cuddly and warm.' Cuddly and warm? 'She's a great actress and, like Marilyn Monroe, she's the sex symbol of her time. I'm just saying this: Kennedy-Monroe, Clinton-Stone - it would have been perfect.' </p> <p>Then there's Warren Beatty, whose political ambitions are derided not only because he is 'the man with the golden Willard'. He quotes Joan Collins: 'Three, four, five times a day was not unusual for Warren. And he was able to accept phone calls at the same time.' </p> <p>The most wonderfully insulting reference to Beatty concerns not his sexual prowess but his own presidential ambitions - and his lacking the concentration required to last four years in the White House. In conversation, Eszterhas adds: 'Warren's problem is common for method actors. It's a natural reaction - method actors getting too caught up in their parts. He had done Bulworth and he couldn't let go. He had to pretend that he could do it in real life. You see? Politics as Hollywood and vice versa.' </p> <p>The book also fantasises about Farrah Fawcett Majors defecating on a lawn at a public function and Richard Gere unzipping his flies and revealing 'no boxers' while pitching a movie idea to Eszterhas. </p> <p>Eszterhas said some weeks ago that he still intended to eat at Spago's and 'get good tables'. 'Since then,' he assured me last Wednesday, 'I have eaten there, got an excellent table and many people came up to me to say how much they enjoyed my book, not least because they were not in it.' </p> <p>'He's made a few enemies with this,' one insider told The Observer . But when Tina Brown threw a party for him, 'about 300 of the supposedly offended Hollywood people turned up. Mike Medevos, head of Phoenix, said he loved it and he was happy he wasn't in it. There are plenty more like him.' </p> <p>The White House has nothing to say, even though American Rhapsody is as sympathetic a portrait as Bill Clinton is likely to get in any book that is not by a party-political ally. In understanding the Willard-propulsion of Clinton the man, Eszterhas has explained the drama that befell Clinton the President. And by seeing that drama through Hollywood's eyes , he has spoken for that stubborn 65 per cent of Americans who were unmoved by the whole affair. </p> <p>But there is one thing Eszterhas cannot forgive: the lying. Richard Nixon casts the shadow of evil in this book. 'The important thing,' says Eszterhas, 'was that Nixon was a liar and the Sixties was about telling the truth. Now we had Clinton, jabbing his middle finger at us with a great big fucking lie.'</p>",
  "Stephen Haseler (To the republic, last week) sets out a credible case for the ease with which Britain could become a republic. Such a move would end forever the democratically debilitating 'politics of deference' which for centuries has ossified the 'top down' British state in a mesh of privilege, precedent and 'looking up to one's betters'. It would create a head of constitutional steam which could sweep away the other anachronisms, such as the lack of a written constitution and a second Westminster chamber which, despite phasing out hereditary peers, is still appointed rather than elected. <p>I do not share Stephen Haseler's belief that New Labour have the political will to make such a manifesto commitment in 2006. I hope however, that my party, the Liberal Democrats, will have sufficient grasp of twenty-first century realities to grasp the nettle firmly, well in time for that general election. Britain as a republic can't come soon enough! <br>Richard Denton-White<br>Portland<br>Dorset </p> <p>The principal argument against making Britain a republic is that it wouldn't really change the actual structure of power and privilege. In fact British republicanism is ideal New Labour radicalism - childish play-politics. To make a significant change in society, abolish the public schools - then at least we wouldn't have the absurd spectacle of public-school-and-Oxbridge gilded youth (and gilded middle-age, come to that) denouncing the 'privilege' of the monarchy in their columns in the best papers.<br>John Wilson<br>London NW3 </p> <p>A 'citizen' is a member of state and is an enfranchised inhabitant of a country. A 'subject' is a member of state and is an enfranchised inhabitant of a country. </p> <p>I cannot see that these terms are mutually exclusive. Both indicate 'membership of a state'; a British 'subject' is definitely 'enfranchised'; a European 'citizen' is undoubtedly subject to 'political rule', and gives 'allegiance' to his or her head of state in the exercise of legitimate executive power. A British monarch is not a subject but is required to obey our laws (since Magna Carta), just like any citizen or subject.<br>J.M.

  "When Hadassah Lieberman, wife of the man who may be America's next Vice-President, came on stage in Los Angeles the other night, I had her pre-distributed script open in front of me. I knew what her first word would be. The delegates did their ecstasy bit, waving posters which bore her name. She blinked in the arc-lights - and finally spoke the ordained word. 'Wow!' she said. And then she ad-libbed. 'Wow!' she said again. <p>Modern American political conventions are all canned 'Wow!' Nothing happens by accident. You can read them as you used to be able to read the old Pravda. As speaker after speaker cries that 'Al Gore will fight to save the world or fight to keep his shoes shiny', you know that the focus groups have dubbed him a wimp, not a fighter - that, rhetorically, he must fight and fight again. </p> <p>Mush from the middle? The third way lives? You might suppose so after a convention season where the Republican candidate talks incessantly about compassion and Joe Lieberman preaches consensus as though it was the orthodox faith; where blacks and Latinos crowd both stages proclaiming 'inclusion'; where defence is strong and education is the flavour of the new century. Leave no child behind: leave no voter behind. It doesn't make much difference, does it? George W. Bush, with his crinkly grin and adoring Laura - or Al, with his thin lips straining to smile at an adoring Tipper? </p> <p>That apparent sameness, that clustering in the centre, is vital to Bush. It makes the choice for November the fresh face from Texas rather than the same old grimace from inside the Washington beltway. It puts Gore-bore (and sleaze fatigue) at the top of the agenda and offers the promise of tax cuts without guilt, wallets stuffed by caring folks for the benefit of deserving folks. It brings 'honour and dignity' back in the Oval Office just as - wow! - Ken Starr's heirs convene another Lewinsky grand jury. </p> <p>A shrewd pitch enough from shrewd spinners. It worked throughout the summer. It worked in Philadelphia. It is still working on the public opinion polls. It takes eight fat years of rare prosperity for granted - an act of God - and bestows their accumulated riches on the electorate. You are invited to conclude there are no differences which matter. </p> <p>But - on the long trek from Pennsylvania to California - there are differences, real differences. The question is how much they can be made to matter. </p> <p>Personalities, inevitably, first. George Dubya, the focus groups proclaim, is a likeable guy who'd buy you a club soda at the country club any night. He's a man's man: and his lead is built on men. Maybe he can't tell Slovakia from Slovenia, but nobody seems to care. Perhaps he reminds America of the most venerated President of modern history, Ronald Reagan. </p> <p>Al Gore? He has, his own script admits, some 'imperfections' - 'I'm too serious and I talk too much about substance and policy'. Mr Also-Ran in any popularity contest. 'But the presidency is more than a popularity contest... Sometimes you have to choose to do what's difficult or unpopular.' Gore only had to make one half-decent speech in this contest, Fosbury flopping over a low hurdle of expectations, and he made it here on Thursday. He needed, after months of inertia, to define his campaign. He probably did that. </p> <p>Gore had two dragons to slay. One was Ralph Nader out on the Green wing, biting four or more per cent out of his natural vote. Thus he had to go on and on (as he does) about toxic waste mountains. He also had to make himself into a cuddly human being - the squeaky-clean son of a great dad from Possum Hollow, Tennessee. A Not-Bill-Clinton. Well, suspend judgment there. His family and friends, massed legions of eulogists, did their best. </p> <p>For good or ill, they're in love with a substantive guy who has resolved to get by on policies, not charm. An un-American way. The pundits, after he sat down, droned on about a second-hand State of the Union speech, full of promises and issues - as though those things didn't matter. But dig a little deeper, for there are a lot of 'hot button' issues in the package. </p> <p>Pensioners want to get their prescription drugs free on Medicare. If you're sick or creaky, that $5,000 a year saved - cash you can use on food and rent. Middle-class parents will like the idea of tax allowances to help them save for their children's college fees. Working mothers want universal pre-school education. Working girls want to choose their abortion. And then there are guns. School massacres come and go, and nothing happens. Not even childproof locks on revolvers or mandatory checks on criminal records when you buy your arsenal over the counter. </p> <p>George W. Bush is signed up, on the record in Texas, for a policy which allows citizens to carry loaded guns in churches, synagogues, hospitals, amusement parks. When women voters find that out, they switch. A five-point gap in Gore's favour yawns suddenly to over 20 per cent. In a world of generalised content, specific issues can count - and the Democrats intend to be very specific. </p> <p>That is what will give this content its wider resonance - thought food for the Blairs and the Hagues. Bush leads the New Republicans, a party in the recovery ward after the Clinton routs, a party which has concluded that happy emollience works better than right-wing snarls. He wants (shades of the Kinnock years) to make the GOP electable again - and he is making a formidable job of it. The Democrats, in contrast, are groping for an image. Are they old Bill or new Al? Are they the deliverers of the centrist message or bearers of a fresh flame? </p> <p>Gore seems to have resolved that dilemma in his own mind at last. 'I stand before you as my own man' - one, for all the good times, who 'is not satisfied'. His chosen battleground is where the 'working families of America live', the ordinary folks with ordinary dreams. His tax cuts will be 'targeted' and prudent - not Bush's blowing of the surplus on goodies for the rich. </p> <p>He sounds, deliberately, more hard-edged, more liberal, than the departing leader; perhaps a Brown after the departure of Blair. He hymns 'fiscal discipline', but he doesn't expect Los Angeles to join in the chorus. </p> <p>This could just be the British general election of 2007: the moment when satisfied voters feel like a change of scene and fancy whatever variety of (post-euro) New Conservatism is on offer. </p> <p>It could also provide a few current clues to a Labour Government wondering about activist apathy. How wide can you spread the mush in the middle? Bush believes in coagulation. Gore wields a spatula. There is a difference. </p> <p>But a difference in theory, or a difference in practice? Here we are straight back to furrowed brows in Downing Street and education, education, education. George Dubya, hailing modest Texan success, uses education as his passport to compassion. </p> <p>Al Gore, in thrall to the teacher unions, loads cash into the public school system. Will anyone, in four years' time, be able to see a difference in the supreme area of mush where real progress comes on a snail's back? Will the specifics sink in a quagmire of detail? </p> <p>The party of Watergate hails honour and dignity. The party of Bill Clinton hails faith and family. Maybe America shrugs and presses another button. This is Al Gore's election to throw away over a blue ocean of booming shares, rising wages and 22 million new jobs. </p> <p>Glum Democrats, after Philadelphia, thought that - haplessly - he would do just that. Los Angeles has not revived their spirits entirely, yet they can hope a little again. </p> <p>Gore will, indeed, have to fight the fight - and, as the script says, 'walk the walk'. But there is still a lot of talking the talk to do, too: the How? After the Wow!</p>",
  "<p>While reporters this week wasted their papers' budgets in Los Angeles covering the shadow puppetry called the Democratic Convention, America's political future was being decided 80 miles south, in San Diego. </p> <p>Here, where a bilious tumble of freeways, McDonald's and Wal-Marts smashes up against the Mexican border, San Diego's 2.6 million residents have been involuntarily enrolled as laboratory rats in a scary economic experiment. Just weeks ago, San Diego became the first city in America to end the regulation of electricity prices. </p> <p>When California's state senate voted to bring the miracle of market competition to electricity, they wrote right into the law that domestic prices would fall by 'at least 20 per cent'. No points for guessing what happened. The price for energy rose by 379 per cent compared with last year. </p> <p>Actually, Californians were lucky. I located Beth Emory, former counsel for the agency that runs the daily power auction. She said that on the first hot summer day, when California needed every bit of juice it could find, generating companies bid in their electricity at $9,999 per unit. This was 1,000 times the formerly controlled price of $10. </p> <p>But San Diegans were fortunate. In their greed-crazed rush, the sellers assumed the system's computers could only handle four-digit bids. In fact, the computers would have accepted seven figures, taking bids high enough to bankrupt half the families in the state in one day. </p> <p>I have been able to trace San Diego's economic plague to the original carrier: one Daniel Fessler. Fessler, the Golden State's former chief utility regulator, flew to England some years ago and carried back with him an infatuation with Margaret Thatcher's economic theorems and an unnatural affection for her troubled offspring, the England and Wales Power Pool. </p> <p>The Pool, at around 4pm or so each day, is seized by a clique of electricity companies which crank up prices by as much as 2,000 per cent. Even Britain's somnolent regulators have twigged to the fact that this supposed free-market auction house is, as Ofgem recently reported, a playground for price-fixing and collusion. </p> <p>One suspects California's politicos knew this. After all, the majority of Britain's electricity system is owned by the same US operators that have San Diego by the bulbs, including Enron (Houston), Edison International (Los Angeles), PPL and Southern Company (Atlanta). This week, the last pair took over Hyder, Wales's water and power utility. </p> <p>But something extraordinary has happened in San Diego. Laid-back Californians have leapt off their surfboards and are waving two fingers in the air and chanting 'Boycott!' </p> <p>The electricity companies can send out their bloated bills, but the tanned masses are not going to pay. By the thousands and now, apparently, by the tens of thousands, customers have simply continued to pay only the old, lower, prices. </p> <p>Joining the boycott this week: the city's school system, the Council of Churches and even, without a hint of shame, the state senator who sponsored the original deregulation law. </p> <p>In Bolivia, when British-American, owner of the city of Cochabamba's utility, hiked prices and customers boycotted bill payments, the government confronted protesters with bullets and martial law. </p> <p>But in California, protesters were met by panicked politicians. The leftish governor of California, Democrat Gray Davis, drafted an emergency law to knock back prices retroactively by 60 per cent. The state's utility regulators effectively endorsed the revolt by barring San Diego Gas and Electric from cutting off service to customers who refuse payments through October (up to election day). </p> <p>The Governor has launched an investigation into market manipulation. According to consumer advocate Mike Florio, a member of the power system's oversight panel, the governor won't have far to look. There is 'stacking and cramming' (tricks learned in the UK) plus false scheduling and transmission line games that have cost San Diego about $304 million this summer. </p> <p>On one day, for example, an Enron trader sold the state about 500 megawatts of power to go over a 15 mw line, which is like pouring a gallon of gasoline into a thimble. This forced the system operators to make costly emergency purchases, blowing market prices through the roof. </p> <p>The power pirates are stunned by the public revolt. After all, though San Diego prices have skyrocketed to about 10p per kilowatt hour, this is no more than US power companies typically charge their British customers - who endure the fleecing with a stoic shrug. </p> <p>So what has got the beach bunnies up in arms? Amer ica's little secret is that the New World Order of free markets and deregulation is for export only. America has always expected that, within its borders, the public, through state power, should squeeze down the prices and profits of monopoly service companies. </p> <p>The city of Los Angeles owns its own electricity and water system and virtually gives the stuff away. Good. We don't have to put up with World Bank dicta for privatisation and market pricing designed, as we Angelenos say, for the rest of you schmucks. </p> <p>And there's something else. Deep in its commercialised, Disneyfied heart, America still throbs with a certain democratic spirit. Not, as Jonathan Freedland would have it, the spirit of Thomas Jefferson and the Bill of Rights, of toleration and public discourse; I'm talking about the spirit of Charles Bronson and Death Wish, the coiled snake on the Revolutionary Flag: Don't tread on me! </p> <p>Since long before the recent price hike, 46,000 San Diegans have voluntarily paid $15 a year to belong to the Utility Consumers Action Network (Ucan), the sole work of which is to harass, challenge, sue and otherwise drive electricity and phone companies up against the wall. </p> <p>Ucan sponsored the can't-pay-won't-pay radio adverts. And there are other utility-bashing groups. It is the American genius for public vengeance. </p> <p>The San Diego power rebellion, blessed by the state's Democrats, should be one hell of an election platform for Al Gore. After all, it was Fessler and his fellow Republicans, when they controlled the state's government, who passed the deregulation law. But Gore has consumer blood on his hands. </p> <p>Though not something they would put on their campaign posters, Clinton and Gore have promoted California-style deregulation as the model for the entire US. </p> <p>(Let's just note that a big winner in the deregulation game is Entergy of Little Rock, Hillary's former client. On the other hand, another electricity profiteer is Sam Wyly, a man who made wealthy George W Bush even wealthier.) </p> <p>This week, while Al practiced his platitudes to salarymen and retainers inside the convention hall, Ralph Nader came to town to remind Californians that he was a founding father of Ucan. </p> <p>Polls show fed-up Californians giving Nader 10 per cent of the state's votes. If Nader's support holds, Bush will win all of California's electoral votes, and thereby, the White House. </p> <p>It seems unfair that Gore should pay the price for his complicity in the electricity shake-down, especially as George W's buddies joined in the rip-off. </p> <p>But then, given that Gore has also entered the ghoulish contest over who is the strongest supporter for capital punishment, it is only just that his campaign may come to an end in California's electric chair. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:gregory.palast@theguardian.com\">gregory.palast@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Many of those who watched President Clinton's valedictory speech to the Democratic convention in Los Angeles heard the greatest political orator of his day wrap up a mesmerisingly boastful and assertive performance with a curiously self-abnegating farewell sentence. <p>'And remember,' he concluded, 'whatever you think about me, keep putting people first ... I love you and good night.' </p> <p>But is that what he actually said? No sooner had the next day's papers hit the newsstands, with a swathe of commentators reluctantly acknowledging the President's rhetorical supremacy, than the White House press office put out an urgent correction. The President had emphatically not said 'whatever', it was announced; rather, he used the unambiguously self-satisfied 'whenever'. </p> <p>For Clinton-watchers, it was a vintage moment. What exactly had we heard? Was it a Freudian slip? Did Clinton mean to say one thing but, stricken by an unexpected rush of conscience, end up improvising something else? Had he finally acknowledged that some voters might be justifiably disillusioned with his character, his equivocations and his failure to fulfil their expectations, only to back-track the next day when he started to brood on the implications of his unforced error of self-analysis? </p> <p>Or had he meant it all along, seducing his audience with a brilliant tour-de-force recitation of his achievements (balanced budgets, crime-busting, the first steps towards world peace in a variety of hot-spots and record-breaking prosperity), while at the same time managing to gloss over the myriad catastrophes of his administration, from his proposed health-care reforms to the far greater disaster of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky and the other scandals that dogged his term of office - Whitewater, Vince Foster's suicide etc? </p> <p>The 'whatever' fuss also brought back memories of that low point in Clinton's scandal-ridden second term in which, during his grilling by the special prosecutor, he debated, lawyer-like, the meaning of 'is'. </p> <p>That the White House cared enough to issue a correction to his speech was telling in another way. Clinton is a President obsessed with his legacy. Few occupants of the White House have been as frank in their admission of job satisfaction. 'To serve as President,' he told the adoring convention delegates last Monday night, 'has been an honour, a privilege, and a joy.' And few have worried so much, perhaps with justification, about their place in the history books. </p> <p>For the American people, the Clinton presidency has also been an unforgettable time, not least thanks to the millennial boom. But the true measure of their love-hate relationship with him has not, I think, been the astoundingly favourable poll numbers he has recorded, nor the widespread suspicion that if he were to run again, he would beat George Bush hands down. </p> <p>Politically speaking, Clinton is formidably gifted, as enemies like Newt Gingrich have discovered. Power is a great aphrodisiac, but a remarkable range of normally cool-headed customers attest to Clinton's astounding personality, his rhetorical brilliance and wonk-like grasp of complex issues. </p> <p>He is exceedingly intelligent and seems all the more so after the shocking stupidity of Ronald Reagan and the gung-ho anti-intellectualism of Bush Senior. It's only a guess, but Clinton must be among the most intelligent men to have occupied the White House in the last 100 years. </p> <p>That is, however, as nothing compared to his psychological sway over the imaginations of the American people. One index of Clinton's dominance of the psychological landscape has been the remarkable quantity of cinematic fiction inspired by his tenure, from The American President to Independence Day, from Wag the Dog to Absolute Power. And there are many more to come. Clinton has captivated America's creative community, its writers, journalists and filmmakers as no other President in living memory. </p> <p>It's often said that we live in an age of political pygmies, but here, in our midst, warts and all, is a giant, a psychologically enthralling character, a figure for the playwrights and a man of Shakespearian dimensions. Whatever his place in history turns out to be (either footnote or milestone), there can be little doubt that he will, like that other contemporary American political tragedy, Richard Nixon, provoke a library of political exegesis. There is, indeed, already a shelfload of pro- and anti-Clinton memoirs by ex-Friends of Bill. </p> <p>Clinton has been a political giant, but a profoundly flawed one. As the New York Times observed after his speech: 'There will always be a sadness that the Clinton record will forever be blotted because his leadership gifts were offset by a self-destructive streak at the centre of his personality.' </p> <p>The immediate aftermath of Clinton's convention speech has been typical of his time in office. First, there was the language, then there was the interpretation and then the correction. Next came the ugly rumours, crisply reported by the astute and reliable Maureen Dowd. (Bill is mad at Al; Hillary can't stand Tipper.) Finally, there was the reappearance of Clinton's vulnerability to scandal in the form of the reconvened Grand Jury. </p> <p>To an Americanophile - and I confess to being one - it is a terrible shame. Here we have the spectacle of the most brilliant political performer of his age unable to break free from the prison of his character or from the prison of partisan politics which his genius has inspired. </p> <p>And yet, to quote the New York Times again: 'For all that, Mr Clinton will go into party history as the only politician of his decade with a personal magnetism and communicative skill to match those of Mr Reagan and Mr Clinton's boyhood idol, John F. Kennedy.'</p>",
  "Two images stand out from the protests taking place outside the Democrats' convention in Los Angeles this week. The first was of battalions of riot police, equipped as if for an invasion, standing guard outside the downtown temples of corporate America as demonstrators marched past. The second was of the mainly Latino workers in the Broadway sweatshops leaning out of windows to cheer on the marchers protesting against \"corporate greed\" and globalisation. <p>The images symbolise both what is missing from conventional American politics, what divides the haves and have-nots of the world's richest country and what is fuelling the still unspecific but growing international movement that started in Seattle last year and will be seeking another platform in Prague next month. </p> <p>Only half of the American electorate vote for the president and the events of the past week in LA have partly served to explain why. The financial clout of the corporations now gives the appearance of having permeated every aspect of policy-making so that it is no longer clear to many people whether their elected representatives are acting in the voters' interests or their backers' interests. </p> <p>Do politicians shy away from real gun reform because of the gun manufacturers' lobby? Do they back a judicial system that jails more than 2m Americans because the prison-industrial complex now carries such weight? Are they helping the Colombian government in a civil war because they want to protect the interests of American oil and because it suits the military-industrial complex? For many politicians the answer may be no, but the suspicion will remain as long as the race is to the richest. The news this week that George W Bush had now raised $100m for his campaign and his running mate, Dick Cheney, had received a corporate pay-off of $20m further emphasised the great gulf between those inside the safe convention walls and those outside on the streets. And it is this gut feeling that the corporations and the international financial bodies are now controlling decisions on wages, the environment or immigration, that has helped to mobilise this still loosely-knit confederation of protest. </p> <p>What fuels it, too, in the United States, is the feeling that neither of the two main parties offer alternatives on what are to some people the most important issues of the day. One of the angriest demonstrations of the week focused on those on death row and in jail for drugs offences. Both Democrats and Republicans back the death penalty and both support the \"war on drugs\" that has led to the incarceration of so many. Indeed one of Al Gore's pledges during his acceptance speech was for a further 50,000 police officers. Not a further 50,000 teachers for a country with the illiteracy levels similar to those of many third world countries; not a further 50,000 medical workers for a country where 40m are not entitled to healthcare. No wonder some of the placards outside carried the slogan: \"Don't incarcerate, educate\". </p> <p>The ghost at the feast this week has been Ralph Nader, the Green party's candidate and now the repository of the hopes of the liberal left outside the Democratic party. His name was written in the heavens by a sky-writing plane on Wednesday and has been on the lips of many throughout the week. Is a vote for Nader a vote for Bush is the question that will be asked many times between now and November, but increasingly the evidence is that the uncommitted, the independents and the disillusioned Democrats will be heading his way. If these votes do indeed lose Gore the election, the next big question will be whether it leads to a larger, more focused movement and whether the Greens are the party best equipped to lead it. </p> <p>Al Gore and George W Bush may bask in the warm glow of their respective conventions, but outside the air-conditioned halls it is clear that the old order is no longer trusted by the very people - the young, the poor, the Latinos, the blacks - they are claiming to want to help. Somehow, it seems unlikely that many hands would be waving from sweatshop windows if either of the two presidential parties had ventured down Broadway in their limos this week. </p> <p> duncan.campbell@theguardian.com</p>",
  "Indonesia's disgraced army could be granted an amnesty for human rights abuses in East Timor after a last-minute amendment to the country's constitution. <p>The amendment appeared to contradict President Abdurrahman Wahid's assurances to the UN that Indonesia would conduct its own investigation into massacres in East Timor, and that an international war crimes tribunal was not necessary. </p> <p>The controversial change was introduced on the final afternoon of the annual session of the country's supreme legislative body, the people's consultative assembly (MPR). Some legislators tried to reassure critics that it would exclude major human rights abuses. </p> <p>The MPR also voted unanimously to allow the military to retain its formal role in government for a further five years after the next election, taking it to 2009. </p> <p>Analysts said the moves indicated a reluctance to offend the armed forces, which are still powerful. There has been speculation that the army might stage a coup if it were forced from the political scene. </p> <p>Indonesia's constitution will now say that military personnel cannot be prosecuted for crimes committed before the enactment of the legislation used to prosecute them. A decree to enable Indonesia to investigate the atrocities was cancelled in February, even though a law aimed at creating a special court to deal with past human rights violations by the security forces had yet to be enacted. </p> <p>The constitutional amendment could affect the investigation of military abuses all over the archipelago, from Aceh to West Papua, but will have most immediate relevance to events in East Timor. </p> <p>Hundreds of East Timorese were murdered by Indonesia's military-backed militias before and after the territory voted for independence last year, and hundreds of thousands more were forcibly evacuated to neighbouring West Timor. Soldiers and militiamen destroyed tens of thousands of buildings. </p> <p>Political analyst Kusnanto Anggoro said of the amendment: \"This shows that the military is still a powerful force to be reckoned with.\" </p> <p>But a senior MPR legislator, Jacob Tobing, indicated that it might still be possible to prosecute the dozen generals allegedly responsible for the East Timor abuses. He said that the amendment would probably not apply to \"special crimes\" such as genocide, war crimes and terrorism. </p> <p>One western diplomat said: \"It is all very vague. What is more worrying is that the investigation is proceeding without any formal legal basis so the defence lawyers will be able to announce a very strong case to have any charges thrown out.\" </p> <p>In East Timor, the vast majority of people say those responsible must be tried. What's more, they say the trials should take place in an international tribunal because they do not have confidence in Indonesia's notoriously corrupt legal system. </p> <p>\"The location of the tribunal is not important as long as it's not in Indonesia or under Indonesian law,\" said Aniceto Lopes of the East Timor Human Rights Foundation. </p> <p>A UN spokeswoman said yesterday that the MPR decision would have to be studied more closely before she would comment on whether the international community would now push for an international tribunal. </p> <p>Many UN sources in East Timor say that the international community has little appetite for organising prosecutions because they would be extremely expensive and would risk further destabilising Indonesia. </p> <p>This sentiment is reflected in a UN proposal to cut by almost half the number of international investigators looking into last year's atrocities. </p> <p>Senior UN officials and East Timorese political leaders such as Jose \"Xanana\" Gusmao are also advocating reconciliation rather than justice. </p> <p>But their calls are mostly falling on deaf ears. \"We endured 25 years of hell under Indonesian occupation,\" said Augusto da Silva, a farmer. \"Not only do we want justice, but we need justice in order to put the past behind us and move on.\"</p>",
  "There will be plenty of Americans wondering this weekend why on earth their political parties still bother hosting conventions. Every four years US commentators lament the lack of debate, the absence of tension, which makes these stage-managed gabfests such an apparent waste of time. Yet every four years the same commentators return, in ever larger numbers, to observe every detail. Is it all in vain? Well, not quite. For conventions still serve two useful purposes. First, they provide an insight into the state of the parties which hold them. Second, they often give a presidential candidate a vital dose of \"bounce\" in the opinion polls before campaigning gets underway in earnest in September. Judged by those standards, how did the Democrats do this week in Los Angeles? <p>The first measure does not yield good news. Two weeks ago the Republicans staged a near-model convention. They presented a public face utterly at odds with the mean-spirited, harsh image the party acquired in the age of Newt Gingrich. Instead of white men in suits, they presented an on-stage gala of blacks and Hispanics, gays and single moms: all wordlessly reinforcing George W Bush's message of \"compassionate conservatism\". Sure, it was fake - but it worked. Mr Bush left Philadelphia with a poll lead close to 20 points. </p> <p>The aim of the Republicans' cuddly new image was to reach out to non-committed voters in the centre. That's what the Democrats needed to do in LA, too. Instead they spent most of the week talking to themselves, shoring up their own liberal base by wheeling out old favourites like Ted Kennedy and Jesse Jackson. They had to because Democratic activists arrived in LA still distinctly lukewarm towards their candidate, Al Gore. They needed to be revved up. But it is a sure sign of weakness if a party has still not mobilised its own troops by the time it meets for a convention. </p> <p>Still, if Los Angeles shed some unflattering light on the Democrats, what did it do for Mr Gore? On the positive side, it confirmed that he is a man of substance. His acceptance speech on Thursday night was unashamedly focused on the issues. He boasted of the prosperity which has flowered under the Clinton-Gore administration and explained how he would use it on health and education, while his opponent would squander it with \"a huge tax cut for the wealthy\". He said he was on the side of working families, while Mr Bush would be the poodle of powerful corporate interests. And he staked out progressive stances on social questions like the environment, abortion, gun control and the overweening influence of cash in American politics. </p> <p>It all added up to a decent programme, one usefully distinct from Mr Bush's - which is clearly how Mr Gore wants to be judged. \"The presidency is more than a popularity contest,\" he said, tacitly acknowledging the charisma advantage his opponent enjoys over him. This may be his best hope: to admit that, as he put it, he will never be \"the most exciting politician\" - and then to define the contest as a clash of rival plans for the country. That, Mr Gore believes, is a fight he can win. The cruel question now is whether he is right. Can a politician who cannot deliver a speech without treading on his own applause lines beat an opponent with real charm? Can a man so wooden, he makes a kiss with his own wife look excruciating seduce a nation? Even if America agrees with Mr Gore on the issues, will that be enough to make them vote for him? In November Americans will decide what matters more: style or substance. After this week, that choice is clear.</p>",
  "The first reactions to Al Gore's speech were positive with an instant ABC poll showing Mr Gore ahead of George W Bush by 46% to 43%. While the poll comes with the usual health warnings, it is in sharp contrast to the instant poll after the Republican convention two weeks ago which showed Mr Bush with a 17 point lead. <p>The results of the poll were reflected by reactions both inside and outside of the convention. Joan Groener, a Democrat attending the convention as a guest, said: \"He may be a little stiff but that doesn't matter. He's got what it takes to lead this country. Mr Gore's smart and, bless him, Mr Bush ain't.\" </p> <p>Andres Torres, 82, a former social worker, said: \"I voted for Roosevelt when I was in the army and I had a great admiration for Gore's father. I think that Gore has shown he is for the working man, the less-chance people. He's shown that he's head and shoulders above Bush. You've got to look into his heart: he wants to help.\" </p> <p>Gonzalo Rojas, 21, a student from San Diego, said: \"I think that Gore has shown that he represents the ideals that I was raised to respect.\" </p> <p>As Mr Gore was receiving his ecstatic standing ovation inside the Staples Centre, around 5,000 protesters were gathered outside in the designated demonstration area as the week's protests ended. Most of the demonstrators then marched through the night under the watchful eye of a police helicopter to the Twin Towers jail in central Los Angeles where those who had been arrested during the week and not bailed were being held. A total of 194 people were arrested during the week. </p> <p>A rally with the singing of Bob Marley's No Woman, No Cry and Zapatista songs took place as relatives of people who had died in custody made brief speeches. There was a minute's silence for \"the brothers and sisters in Twin Towers\". </p> <p>Once again there were tense standoffs between the two sides and once again the demonstration passed off mostly peacefully. Earlier in the day there had been a march against sweat-shops through the city centre. </p> <p>Lisa Fithian, one of the members of D2KLA, which had helped to coordinate the week's protests said: \"I think it's been an amazingly successful week. People came here with the goal of bringing their messages to the delegates in a powerful and creative way and they have done that. We faced police violence and we de-escalated it.\" She said that the movement had learned a lot about organisation in the week and about working out future strategy. </p> <p>\"I think people have been showing a lot of maturity and showing that it's not just here today and gone tomorrow,\" Ms Fithian said. \"I have heard that the delegates are talking about the protests.\" She said she had been disappointed in some of the media coverage: \"We had a march of 20,000 strong and it got bumped from the news.\" </p> <p>Commander David Kalish of the LAPD expressed his satisfaction with the week's events: \"Generally we are quite pleased.\" He said that the demonstrators had been largely peaceful. It was confirmed that police \"scouts\" had mingled with the crowd and some had even been arrested and shot at when police opened fire on two occasions with rubber bullets. Many businesses reopened yesterday after shuttering their premises in anticipation of violence. </p> <p>Inside the convention, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, the lieutenant-governor of Maryland and the eldest daughter of Robert Kennedy, who was assassinated in Los Angeles, acknowledged the protesters at a briefing with the foreign press. </p> <p>\"I'm very excited about the protests and it gives me great hope for the future,\" Ms Townsend said. \"The worst threat to democracy is apathy and indifference. They are raising serious issues about the globalisation of the economy. We are blessed by the protests.\"</p>",
  "Al Gore offered Americans a continuation of Bill Clinton's centrist policies dressed in more class-conscious language in his acceptance speech to the Democratic convention in Los Angeles, and then set off at once for the battleground states where the US election will be won and lost in November. <p>Mr Gore's speech was universally seen as the most important 51 minutes of his political life, because he had to calm the worries of a party that feared he was a loser and persuade the general public that he has what it takes to set his stamp on the post-Clinton era. </p> <p>Early assessments were that Mr Gore did what he had to do, energising his supporters and reaching out to uncommitted voters in a more conversational style than he has achieved in the past. </p> <p>Thursday's news that a new grand jury had been empanelled in Washington to examine Mr Clinton's conduct in the Monica Lewinsky affair failed to derail either Mr Gore's big moment in Los Angeles or the politically crucial American media coverage of it yesterday. None of the US television networks featured the Clinton story on breakfast time bulletins, while the Los Angeles Times relegated the story to an inside page. </p> <p>The now officially nominated Democratic presidential candidate and his running mate, Joe Lieberman, lost no time in taking their message to middle America. Only hours after wrapping up the conven tion in California, they boarded a river boat in La Crosse, Wisconsin, to begin a campaign trip down the Mississippi under the banner \"Setting Course for America's Future\". </p> <p>In what many see as the crucial line of his speech Mr Gore told the 4,000 delegates: \"I stand here tonight as my own man, and I want you to know me for who I truly am.\" Those words marked a climactic moment in the vice-president's long and sometimes laboured struggle to define his political personality in terms with which both he and the voters can be at ease. </p> <p>Mr Gore's speech reflected what may be an irreconcilable problem facing not just the Democrats but all third way political strategies. Mr Gore needs to stop the centrist voters, whom Bill Clinton successfully courted, from reverting to Mr Bush, but at the same time he needs to mobilise his own core support to turn out on November 7 and to prevent the left from defecting to the Green candidate, Ralph Nader. </p> <p>Mr Gore's policy prescriptions were generally Clintonite: fiscal discipline (he promised to balance the budget every year he is in office), guaranteed health care for children, prescription drug benefits for the elderly, universal pre-school education, and a continued expansion of community policing (Mr Gore also promised to bring the crime figures down each year). </p> <p>As in Mr Bush's speech to the Republican convention two weeks earlier, there was only a brief discussion of American foreign policy. Mr Gore said nothing about national missile defence. </p> <p>Throughout his speech Mr Gore used a language which Mr Clinton generally avoids. He presented himself as a \"fighter\" - the term was used repeatedly both by and about Mr Gore all week. \"I've taken on the powerful forces. And as president I'll stand up to them and I'll stand up for you,\" he said. </p> <p>He also appeared to go some way towards tightening the US stance on global free trade policy, pledging standards on child labour, workers' rights and the environment. Free trade must \"lift everyone up, not bring anyone down\", Mr Gore said. </p> <p>Early in his remarks, he paid tribute to Mr Clinton. \"Millions of Americans will live better lives for a long time to come because of the job that's been done by President Bill Clinton,\" he said. But that was the one and only mention of the leader whom Mr Gore has served with for eight years. \"This election is not an award for past performance,\" Mr Gore said. </p> <p>Towards the end of his speech Mr Gore addressed some of his perceived failings head-on. \"I know my imperfections. I know that sometimes people say I'm too serious, that I talk too much substance and policy. Maybe I've done that tonight.\" </p> <p>The crowd roared back that he had done no such thing, even though Mr Gore's address was full of detailed pledges on domestic issues with middle American voters in mind - \"working families\" as Mr Gore repeatedly calls them. </p> <p>Mr Gore went on: \"If you entrust me with the presidency, I know I won't always be the most exciting politician. But I pledge to you tonight: I will work for you every day and I will never let you down.\" </p> <p><b>The final reckoning</b></p> <p><b> Gone but not forgotten</b> </p> <p>The 21 plane trees removed from the area before the convention because police believed they could be used as weapons by protesters. They are now due to be replaced. </p> <p><b> Al Gore</b> \"If you entrust me with the presidency, I know I won't always be the most exciting politician but I pledge to you tonight: I will work for you every day and I will never let you down\" </p> <p><b> Slogan on T-shirt for sale near the convention</b> </p> <p>Let's lick Bush and Dick </p> <p><b> Back to reality</b> The convention stages were kept intact for an extra day so that they could be used for the filming of The West Wing, a series about the White House </p> <p><b> Award for dance</b> Tipper Gore for an impromptu boogie on stage before her husband was introduced </p> <p><b> Number of times Gore mentioned the word \"fight\" in his speech</b> 20 </p> <p><b> One of the biggest cheers of the night</b> Gore's stated support for a woman's right to choose </p> <p><b> Money raised for the Gore campaign at a party hosted by Barbra Streisand</b> $5.2m</p>",
  "Tony Blair has imposed a two-year ban on a former civil servant giving commercial advice to Britain's leading defence contractor, British Aerospace, to pre-empt allegations of sleaze over billions of pounds of orders for the armed forces. <p>The prime minister personally approved the ban on Sir David Davies, the former chief scientific adviser at the Ministry of Defence, because he used to chair an internal Whitehall committee which advised ministers on the \"best buys\" for defence equipment. Sir David holds enormous inside knowledge about the MoD's defence procurement needs. </p> <p>He applied on retirement last year to join British Aerospace as a member of the strategy board of the Virtual University - an initiative funded and run by BAe. </p> <p>This led to the appointment being referred to Whitehall's advisory committee on business appointments, which recommended a six-month delay in him taking up the job and two year ban on his advising BAe about anything except education and staff training. </p> <p>The committee asked Mr Blair to approve its recommendation, which will remain in force until December 2001. </p> <p>The prime minister's involvement is revealed in the latest report from the committee, which was placed in the House of Commons library as MPs went on their summer recess. </p> <p>The report reveals that restrictions have been imposed on 129 senior civil servants and one minister in taking up private sector jobs. Of Sir David's case it says: \"We were concerned that his early association with this large defence contractor, albeit in an academic capacity, might be viewed with suspicion.\" </p> <p>Mr Blair also approved a six month delay on Air Marshal Sir Colin Terry becoming group managing director of Inflite Engineering, a company which works for defence contractors. </p> <p>Other former civil servants who face restrictions in taking up new jobs include Stephen Littlechild, the former head of the electricity regulator, Offer, who was banned from advising electricity companies seeking licences for a year. </p> <p>Sir David Gore-Booth, the former high commissioner for India, was prevented for six months from dealing with India in his new job as special adviser to the banker HSBC holdings. </p> <p>Another civil servant, Brian Hilton, the former director general of corporate and consumer affairs at the Department of Trade and Industry and the man who ran John Major's citizen's charter office, was handed a six month ban on dealing with any company involved with the competition authorities. He has set up his own consultancy and has to get approval for each new commission until 2002. </p> <p>Doug Henderson, the former defence minister, has also been banned for a year from dealing with defence companies in his two new jobs as an adviser to BIC Systems and as a director of Audioware, his own company. This runs out in November. </p> <p>There was no objection to Lord Hoyle, a former government whip, taking up three new jobs since he left the government in May last year. These are as a consultant to Greenalls Group, the brewers; as chairman of Wire (FM); and as a parliamentary adviser to Whitehall advisers who have defence clients. </p> <p>Nor were there any objections to Lord Gilbert, the former defence procurement minister, taking up eight appointments.</p>"
