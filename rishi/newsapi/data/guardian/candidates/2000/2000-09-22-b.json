  "In what might be termed a symbolic truce between the hunter and the hunted, President Vladimir Putin, an ex-career KGB officer, has just been out to the Moscow suburbs to visit Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the elderly Nobel prizewinning author who was hounded out of Russia by the KGB in the 1970s. <p><br><b>Solzhenitsyn</b> <br>The Vremya-MN newspaper describes Putin's homage to the grand old man of Russian letters as a PR stunt and ''a populist move''.</p> <p>''The head of state can't be seen seeking advice unless the adviser is an undisputed authority, a generally recognised guru - and not even Solzhenitsyn can be called that.''</p> <p>Less critically, the Trud newspaper, owned by the Gazprom gas monopoly, notes that both men have a lot in common, an ardent desire to ''save the nation'' and restore Russian greatness.</p> <p>It talks of '' a rapprochement'' between a Russian president and one of the most bitter critics of modern Russia's development.</p> <p><br><b>US Election</b><br>Russia has been thrust into the US election campaign with the Republicans publishing a 209-page denunciation of the Clinton administration's eight years of bungling policy towards Russia.</p> <p>''There are no new facts nor sensations in the report,'' the pro-government Nezavisimaya Gazeta reports sniffily.</p> <p>''It's just an electioneering document. The Republicans accuse their presidential opponent of establishing a relationship with the leadership of Russia.</p> <p>\"A corrupt leadership, the report's authors insist. The only leadership there was, the Democrats respond.''</p> <p>The opposition Segodnya paper notes that the report's publication was brought forward from next July to be wielded as a campaign weapon.</p> <p>''The report itself proves that Washington and Moscow are closer than ever before.'' </p> <p><br><b>Cosmonaut Dies</b> <br>The death at 65 years old of German Titov, the second man into space in 1961 after Yuri Gagarin, is featured in all the papers.</p> <p>''He still holds the record as the youngest man in space - he flew when he was 25 - and has a crater on the moon named after him,'' the English language Moscow Times noted.</p> <p><br><b>Kremlin Media Clampdown</b> <br>The opposition Segodnya, part of the Vladimir Gusinsky media empire which the Kremlin is currently trying to tame, reports that a new ''rapid reaction group'' made up of spin doctors and secret policemen is being formed in the Putin administration to counter opposition media.</p> <p>The brainchild of Gleb Pavlovsky, a PR consultant and key Putin adviser, the unit is to specialise in character assassination, rapid rebuttal of inconvenient reporting, and blackmail to discourage critical coverage of government policy, the newspaper says, citing sources in the Kremlin.</p>",

  "George W Bush wasn't supposed to be campaigning in Florida today. The Republican party wasn't supposed to be spending more than $5m on political advertising in Florida this month. <p>When the two main parties did their calculations for the 2000 election, Florida was firmly assigned in the Republican camp.</p> <p>Not any more.</p> <p>The Sunshine State has turned into the surprise state in the 2000 election. With Bush's brother Jeb now installed as its governor since 1998, most of the pundits originally assumed that Florida would revert to the Republicans in the presidential contest after going for Bill Clinton four years ago.</p> <p>Florida's 25 electoral college votes were seen as one of the key building blocks in George W's march on Washington.</p> <p>But it hasn't worked out that way. As the national polls have moved his way over the past month, Al Gore's long-time belief that Florida was winnable has seemed to be increasingly plausible.</p> <p>Three polls in the state this month have produced three different results - one had Gore up by four points, another had Bush ahead by two, while the third had them tied at 41 per cent each.</p> <p>But the disagreement in the polls only adds to the recognition that Florida is \"competitive\".</p> <p>Florida is the largest state in the US of which that can be said.</p> <p>The only larger states are California and New York, both of which are leaning to Gore, and Texas, which is a banker for Bush.</p> <p>In the 1980s, Florida was predictable too, voting the Republican ticket in four straight elections, until Clinton showed that it was not a lost cause to the Democrats in 1996.</p> <p>That's still the case now. Which is why Dubya is working a full Friday in Florida today, with stops in Sarasota, Tampa and Miami.</p> <p>If Florida swings to Gore, then it's all over for Bush. His schedulers had him in the state last week, and now he's there again this week too.</p> <p>To make sure that Bush doesn't get a free run today, the Democrats have directed Joe Lieberman down to Florida today too, to keep up the pressure and eat into Bush's air time.</p> <p>This is classic US electioneering. Every day you are tied down on defence is a day you let your opponent have a day on the attack somewhere else.</p> <p>Gore, meanwhile, will be piling up the votes today in Pennsylvania, a state which used be counted as a toss-up, but where he is now commandingly ahead.</p> <p>Florida is not just important for the presidential election. It also has a key Senate battle.</p> <p>The state's Republican senator Connie Mack is retiring, so there is an \"open\" contest between Democrat Bill Nelson, a genial centrist, and Republican Congressman Bill McCollum, who became a national figure as one of House of Representatives' Clinton impeachment trial \"managers\" last year.</p> <p>For Clinton, therefore, this is a grudge election, and it is one of the few states in which the president intends to make his presence felt during the campaign.</p> <p>Florida also matters a lot in this year's party battle over control of the House.</p> <p>If the Democrats are going to fulfil their second biggest ambition on November 7, they must pick up at least five seats around the US in order to retake the Congress.</p> <p>That would enable them to install Dick Gephardt of Missouri in the Speaker's chair that was captured by Newt Gingrich in 1994 and is now occupied by Illinois Republican Dennis Hastert.</p> <p>Of the 20 or so Republican-held House seats that really matter this time, three are in Florida.</p> <p>There is McCollum's old district around Disney World in southern Orlando, fellow impeachment manager Charles Canady's seat just east of Tampa (Canady is retiring), and Clay Shaw's ocean-front Costa Geriatrica seat, which takes in both Palm Beach and Miami Beach.</p> <p>Shaw's seat, in particular, could be affected by a new factor - as could the statewide races - as Florida's many Jewish retirees from up north grab the chance to vote for Mrs Lieberman's boy Joe.</p> <p>Florida was one of the first Southern states to move solidly away from the Democrats to the Republicans.</p> <p>Though never a classicly \"southern\" state, Florida could now be one of the first to mark a swing back to the Democrats in the region.</p> <p>There is evidence of that swing in neighbouring Georgia, too.</p> <p>But it's the presidential contest in Florida that really matters in the big picture. It explains why Gore has been to the state three times since the Democratic convention.</p> <p>It explains, above all, why Bush - who is enjoying a better few days in the campaign - is back there again today.</p> <p>No Republican since 1924 has won the White House without also winning Florida.</p> <p>Do what Dubya does too. Keep your eye on Florida. It is the state that Bush simply cannot afford to lose.</p>",
  "Al Gore and George W Bush clashed over the rising price of oil yesterday as the issue that has overturned political assumptions in Europe finally took centre stage in the US presidential election. <p>Mr Gore called on the US government - of which he is still a part - to order the release of part of the national emergency fuel reserves to help drive down domestic petrol prices before winter and the November 7 election. </p> <p>\"We need aggressive action right now,\" Mr Gore said in Maryland. \"It's time for Opec to get serious about the supply and price of oil.\" </p> <p>Within an hour, the Republican candidate George W Bush denounced Mr Gore's proposal as electioneering. \"The strategic reserve should not be used as an attempt to drive down oil prices right before the election, for short term gain at the cost of long term security,\" he said. </p> <p>Though there is no sign of the US being hit by anything remotely approaching the civil unrest in Europe, the price of petrol and domestic heating fuel remains a contentious issue. US oil and petrol prices are among the lowest in the industrial world, but prices at the pumps have increased by more than 50% in the past year and there were protests from truckers last winter. </p> <p>The Democrats want to put themselves on the side of the consumer against the oil companies - partly because both Mr Bush and his running mate Dick Cheney spent many years as oil executives. </p> <p>As well as urging President Clinton to release oil from the reserves, Mr Gore attacked oil companies for profiteering, and called on Opec nations to increase production. </p> <p>Mr Gore also said the Republican-controlled Congress should establish a permanent home heating oil reserve, and urged emergency action to help low income families with their fuel bills. </p> <p>However, the Bush campaign spokeswoman Karen Hughes said dipping into reserves would allow leaders such as Saddam Hussein \"to literally put America over a barrel\". </p> <p>Mr Bush's campaign team also put out copies of a recent memo from the treasury secretary, Larry Summers, in which he claimed that attempts to drive down the price by opening the reserve would be \"a major and substantial policy mistake\".</p>",
  "It is almost inconceivable that Slobodan Milosevic will voluntarily relinquish his grip on power in Yugoslavia even if his leading rival, Vojislav Kostunica, scores an incontrovertible victory in this Sunday's presidential election. Out of office, Mr Milosevic would be prey to his many enemies and some of his current friends. A spate of assassinations earlier this year of prominent, pro-regime figures, some of them like the warlord Arkan close erstwhile Milosevic associates, showed how vulnerable are those in Serbia who lose the power to protect themselves. <p>It is equally unlikely that a new presidential and parliamentary federal leadership in Belgrade, even one still dominated by nationalists, would not, sooner or later, bow to domestic pressure to call Mr Milosevic to account for his innumerable misdeeds. Then again, Mr Milosevic is an indicted international war criminal urgently sought by the UN's Hague tribunal. An ex-president Milosevic might ultimately have little alternative but to flee to a foreign sanctuary. But where? Russia, for all its fraternal sentiments, would find him a diplomatically insupportable embarrassment. China, which maintains ties with Belgrade? Even Beijing might not be so brassy as to defy world opinion in such a case. There is always the Milosevic-friendly, Karen-killing Burmese military junta. Perhaps he could act as their Rangoon consultant on ethnic minority issues. No, it will not wash. The fact of the matter is that there is no hiding place for a dispossessed Mr Milosevic - and he knows it. He has nowhere to run. So instead he runs for the presidency. </p> <p>It would be wonderful to be proved wrong, of course - to find that an unmonitored, unverifiable election already pronounced unfree and unfair by the US, Britain, the EU and Serbia's opposition somehow produced a peaceful, democratic transfer of power. What a joy it would be to discover that Mr Milosevic was not, after all, preparing to engineer a massive fraud or to manipulate and intimidate his way to a second round victory on October 8; was not fully ready to annul Sunday's results, if unfavourable, on some trumped-up pretext and to use the military to suppress any subsequent street protests; and was not planning to provoke, if expedient, a post-election crisis in Montenegro and further destabilisation in Kosovo. How heartening it would be to learn that Mr Milosevic will not exploit the constitutional loophole that allows him, legally albeit dishonourably, to remain if office until next July even if Mr Kostunica wins by an unstoppable landslide. But plainly, the appalling, shameless Slobo is only too ready to do some or all of this in his personal life-or-death struggle to hang on. </p> <p>Much, much less clear is what the west will or can do in response. As so often in the past, this ultimately (and depressingly) depends on Mr Milosevic. If he manages to steal the election without provoking excessive violence, he is unlikely to suffer more than a tightening of sanctions and a lot of verbal abuse. But if an infuriated, thwarted opposition finally digs in its heels and pushes Serbia towards civil war, or if he pretends to have unmasked a western conspiracy, declares an emergency, and moves, say, against Montenegro's leaders, pressure will quickly grow for some kind of renewed military intervention. Limited \"surgical\" air strikes on Yugoslav army units in Montenegro, for example, might just appeal to Al Gore and Tony Blair at this particular juncture in their political lives. They must resist the temptation if it arises. Deep though the dilemma runs, bombing alone will not make it better.</p>",
  "The night in Belgrade belongs to the dogs - 60,000 of them now run wild because people can no longer afford to feed them. The city authorities are so broke that they frequently run out of drugs to put them down. So the dogs are clubbed to death instead. In the early morning the smell of freshly rotting rubbish hangs in the streets. <p>Yugoslavia's presidential elections take place on Sunday and the polls predict that Vojislav Kostunica, a previously unknown lawyer, will beat Slobodan Milosevic - despite the election rigging that Milosevic is famous for, and despite the fact that in Serbia nobody ever wins elections except Milosevic. But if Kostunica wins, it's likely that Milosevic will simply use the media he controls to declare victory anyway. He could do that as early as 10 o'clock on Sunday night, just two hours after the polls close and even before the polling boxes make it to the central sorting office. Welcome to Serbia 2000, where Serbs again will be left with no option but to go out on the streets. But the question is how many still have the energy left to go out and protest again. </p> <p>In the winter of 1996, 50,000 people came out to protest against the rigged local elections, and the police special forces crushed them. They were crushed again in March this year when they came out against him on the anniversary of the war in Kosovo. And on Sunday, Milosevic fights not just for his political future, but to avoid spending the rest of his life in the Dutch seaside prison where the international court in the Hague sends its guilty men. \"If we win, it will be great,\" said one of his long-time party workers. \"If we lose, they will lynch us.\" </p> <p>There are 120,000 police at Milosevic's disposal, and all holiday leave has been cancelled. They will do the job they have done in previous protests. </p> <p>On Planet Serbia, closed off from the world, hundreds of thousands of people have turned the frustration and anger of Milosevic's last 12 years of rule into hatred for both him and his wife. He has been the force behind the three bloody wars - in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo - as he tried to use nationalism to secure his own political future. Milosevic, the puppetmaster of the Balkans, has led his people into the wilderness, turning Serbs into international outcasts. A million of them were driven from their homes in those wars, and before their eyes, Yugoslavia, once the wealthiest, healthiest and most beautiful country in eastern Europe, has shrunk from 250,000 square kilometres of sea and mountains to a violent ghetto a quarter that size. </p> <p>Milosevic will be 60 next birthday. His only vices - apart from an obsession with remaining in power - are whisky and Cuban cigars. Both he and his wife have tragic personal histories. His father, a teacher, shot himself when Milosevic was 21. His mother, also a teacher, killed herself 10 years later. But a former Yugoslav ambassador once said that \"in his presence you can feel his strength of personality. You just feel yourself shrinking down in the armchair when he begins to talk. He is a powerful man\". Richard Holbrooke, who chaired the Dayton peace talks in 1995, said he had a great sense of humour; even the waitresses in the Dayton airbase canteen were charmed by him. </p> <p>He met his wife, Mira Markovic, at school in Pozarevac. Her mother was tortured and executed by the Gestapo in 1944 as one of Tito's partisans. They have two children: Marija, a 34-year-old former journalist; and Marko, a 26-year-old former racing driver who runs his own Milosevic mafia in their home town. </p> <p>In the foyer of a Belgrade police station a nurse is trying to sort out her papers and wants to know if there are any jobs in England so she can get out of \"this madhouse\" before the elections. Behind the desk a fat, almost friendly policeman is frowning into his big yellowing ledger. He sits behind chocolate-coloured tinted glass; a full ashtray and grubby overflowing trays of carbon-copied identity papers. It's like being in eastern Europe in 1989. </p> <p>Kostunica, who presents the first real political challenge to Milosevic, is a former communist but a man with clean hands and no past. The only dirt the regime has managed to get on him is to accuse him of keeping 17 cats - which, according to an editorial in Milosevic's paper Politika, shows that, like the average cat, he is untrustworthy and selfish. The editorial also said that he is supported by \"Gays, lesbians and feminists\". </p> <p>On each of the 10 floors of my apartment block \"Gotov Je\" - he's finished - is plastered above the door of the lift. The opposition movement now claims to have 100,000 activists campaigning against Milosevic, but he is far from finished. Until election day he is fighting for his political life, primarily through the TV station he took over 13 years ago when he first came to power. </p> <p>We are watching the news in a top-floor flat. Outside, across the city's skyline, most of the damage done in Nato's 74 days of bombing has disappeared. The news begins with an eight-minute item about the reopening of the chemical plant outside Belgrade. We see a crowd of slightly distracted looking workers shouting \"Slobo, Slobo\". The next 12 minutes are election speeches from around the country with \"Slobo, Slobo\" being chanted constantly in the background. The captain of the national volleyball team calls on people to vote for Milosevic. One hour into the news and they move on to the 100,000 houses that Milosevic will build in the next 10 years. </p> <p>Sylvia, the mother of the house, stands up. \"I can't watch it. I hate him. I could kill him with my bare hands.\" She is 40 years old and has a masters degree in engineering. \"He stole the best years of my life. We have no money, my car is 13 years old. I survive by smuggling sanitary towels and chocolate from Romania. If he wins again there is no future for us.\" </p> <p>Sylvia escapes to the kitchen. The news goes on about another new electricity plant being opened; then finally there's a mention of the opposition. They are all \"fifth columnists\" and \"traitors\". The hour and 48 minutes of Milosevic propaganda mentions his name more than 40 times and ends with the news that he is leading the \"global battle against the agents of fascism\". </p> <p>Milosevic controls all the media, allowing only a few independents to preach to the converted in Belgrade. The rest of the country receive only his message, and it has worked. The latest polls say that Milosevic could legitimately poll more than 1.5m votes and Kostunica is expected to win by as few as 700,000. But Milosevic is free to fix the ballot in Serb regions of Kosovo and the sister state of Montenegro. </p> <p>His biggest supporters are among the old former communists who hark back to Tito, like 64-year-old Dorde Erdeljan and his 61-year-old wife Stava. They say they watch the news every night - never miss it. \"If it wasn't for Milosevic being so strong we would have had Nato troops on the streets of Belgrade,\" says Dorde. \"Kostunica's coalition are traitors who would betray our country.\" Instead of blaming Milosevic for the hardships of the past 10 years, they point to sanctions and a western conspiracy. \"Look at what happened in Britain over the petrol prices - your country would have collapsed in six months if you had to put up with what Serbia has been forced to suffer.\" </p> <p>The only dissenter on the street is Dobrivoic Radanovic, a 50-year-old former boxer and mechanic. \"Of course I'm voting for the opposition. The only people who won't are the old, the army and police.\" </p> <p>\"What will happen then?\" </p> <p>\"Nothing. People will protest and that will be it. The police will crush them and that will be it. We are a special people, the Serbs. The Turks ruled us and we got used to being oppressed.\" </p> <p>Jovan Dulovic works for the small independent magazine Vreme. He specialises in police affairs. \"The special intervention force can be in Belgrade in a few hours. They are the cream of the force, usually athletes and young guys who do weights. In any normal country of our size the police force should be about 30,000; here we've got 120,000. If the people keep going on the streets, the police will beat them. I don't expect them to do anything immediately - he will wait to see how the protests go. Then if they continue it will be very brutal.\" </p> <p>Milosevic is on the campaign trail, appearing at organised mass rallies. On Monday night, the TV broadcasts a ceremony showing 10,089 people gathering to join his party. Each was presented with a red rose and given 100 German marks for turning up. \"We are living through some sort of tragic comic opera which might look funny but it is very, very dangerous,\" says Lubodrag Stojadivovic, a former spokesman for the Yugoslav army who was sacked for writing an open letter protesting about political interference, especially by Milosevic's wife in the army. </p> <p>I think it is possible that the police will be used in a massive and brutal way. If that doesn't work his last card will be the army, but that is a very dangerous card to play - no matter what the generals say, the soldiers will not go against the people.\" </p> <p>The town where Milosevic and his wife began their lives looks like a pleasant place in the early autumn. All along the main street there are white banners in red letters that read \"Choose people not Nato\" and \"For Yugoslavia\". There's not a single poster or banner for the opposition in sight. The chestnut trees in the square were turning red when Markovic went there last week to address a public rally calling on her town and her nation to support her husband. </p> <p>\"Only about 2,000 people turned up,\" says Mile Yeljkovic, a journalist with Beta, the independent newsagency. \"Even those people were bused in. I heard afterwards that she was in tears, she couldn't believe there were so few people.\" </p> <p>On Sunday, and in the days that follow, Serbia will find out what they already know - that Milosevic will play God to the end. He has no choice. Perhaps that's why this city of Belgrade on this warm September day is full mostly of exhaustion and despair. \"Pandora's box has been opened and the only thing left inside for us now is hope,\" said a beautiful student, plastering opposition posters on a baker's wall. She is 19, and not so tired. </p> <p><b>Life and times of Milosevic</b></p> <p><b> Born:</b><br> August 29 1941, in Pozarevac, Serbia. Following the suicide of his father in 1962, Milosevic was raised by his mother, who also killed herself in 1973. </p> <p><b> Early years:</b> <br>Graduated in law from Belgrade University in 1964 and pursued a business career. He was chief of the state-owned gas company Technogas 1968-78, and member of the board of directors of Beobank (United Bank of Belgrade) 1978-82. </p> <p><b> Political career:</b> <br>Joined the communist party of Yugoslavia when he was 18. Entered politics in 1984. In 1987 he became leader of the Serbian communists. Elected president of the Serbian Republic in 1989. The following year he turned the League of Communists of Serbia into the Socialist party of Serbia and was returned to power in the election of December 1990. </p> <p><b> Croatia:</b><br> Serb forces bombard cities including Dubrovnik and Vukovar as the conflict escalates in 1991. Croatian independence recognised by the EC the following year. </p> <p><b> Bosnia-Herzegovina: </b><br> International recognition of the area as an independent state in April 1992 leads to civil war. Thousands of Muslims massacred by Serbs at Srebrenica in the summer of 1995. Milosevic agrees to peace in the Dayton accord in November of that year. </p> <p><b> Kosovo:</b> <br>The 1998 offensive by Serb forces against the Kosovo Liberation Army leads to the 78-day bombing of Serbia by Nato forces, March to June 1999, which ends when Milosevic agrees to withdraw his troops.</p>",
  "Yugoslavia's army chief ratcheted up the tension yesterday ahead of Sunday's election by claiming that Nato countries planned to send in special forces to help rivals of President Slobodan Milosevic seize power. <p>General Nebojsa Pavkovic's assertion sounded like a pretext for Mr Milosevic to clamp down on protesters or declare a state of emergency if he loses on Sunday - as all opinion polls predict he will. Voters will be choosing a federal parliament, local mayors and the Yugoslav presidency. </p> <p>The army knew of a plan, Gen Pavkovic said, under which there would be disturbances on Sunday \"provoked by special units of foreign armed forces who would be infiltrated into Yugoslav territory on that day\". </p> <p>They would come from the Serb part of Bosnia, from Montenegro and from Kosovo. They would dress in Yugoslav army and police uniforms, he said, and would stage provocations \"under the guise of extending aid to the 'victors' - the opposition\". </p> <p>\"Threats are being addressed to our country at the moment and as a serious army it is our duty to make all the preparations to prevent any surprises,\" he added. </p> <p>Although the general also said the army would accept a genuine opposition victory, he is a Milosevic loyalist. Mr Milosevic has called the vote a choice between \"patriotism and treachery\" and the hint of military action worries western policymakers. </p> <p>European Union foreign ministers offered voters a massive inducement this week to oust the president by announcing that foreign sanctions would be lifted if there was \"democratic change\". </p> <p>The chief opposition candidate, Vojislav Kostunica, is a moderate nationalist who has walked a careful line in recent days by strongly criticising the United States while showing more sympathy for European positions. But he still calls for the unconditional lifting of sanctions and has denounced Nato's bombing of Yugoslavia last year. </p> <p>While western governments can offer an end to sanctions, they cannot agree on what to do if Mr Milosevic \"steals\" Sunday's election by declaring victory on the basis of fraud and ballot-rigging. </p> <p>Diplomats are uncertain how the president will play the election and are unwilling to speculate on his options or their reactions. The only certainties are that Mr Milosevic called the polls early thinking he would win easily because of the opposition's disunity, and that he is as surprised as any one by his opponents' strength. </p> <p>The International Crisis Group, a think-tank that aims to strengthen the capacity of the international community to anticipate conflict, and which has good contacts in Washington and London, this week outlined four scenarios for Sunday's poll. </p> <p>Fearing defeat, the Yugoslav president may call it off after \"provoking some sort of internal crisis through a staged terrorist attack or simulated military coup, or major disruption in Montenegro\". This is unlikely, says the ICG, because it would damage his image of being confident and in control. </p> <p>Scenario two, is \"the big steal\" in which he cheats. A third option is that he plays by the rules on Sunday and accepts defeat knowing that under the constitution he need not hand over power until his mandate ends next August. In the meantime he transfers all power to the Serbian presidency and organises an election victory in Serbia next spring, leaving Mr Kostunica to inherit an empty shell as Yugoslav president. </p> <p>The last option is again that Mr Milosevic accepts a Kostunica victory but over the next few months allows Montenegro to secede, thereby destroying Yugoslavia and leaving Mr Kostunica with no role. </p> <p>Like most observers, the ICG believes the \"big steal\" is the likeliest. All will depend on the opposition's reaction, it says. </p> <p>The opposition might accept cheating in the presidential vote while using its new strength in parliament and town halls to consolidate power for the long haul. Alternatively, it may mount street protests and confront the government, but Mr Kostunica has repeatedly said he does not want bloodshed.</p>",
  "The first evidence emerged yesterday of vote rigging for this Sunday's crucial presidential election in Yugoslavia, as fears grew that President Slobodan Milosevic would use any tactic to stay in power. <p>The discovery of a completed ballot slip containing a vote for the president adds to concerns that fraud on a massive scale would enable Mr Milosevic to overcome the lead of his chief rival, Vojislav Kostunica. </p> <p>The slip was found in in the letterbox of an electoral monitoring group, the Centre for Free Elections (Cesid). The slip, bearing the official stamp, carries the name of the five candidates for president. Slobodan Milosevic is circled. </p> <p>\"We are deeply concerned. Is it possible that those ballots are circling Serbia?\" asked Slobodanka Nedovic of Cesid, who was told by election officials that they would \"discuss the problem tomorrow\". </p> <p>Many in Belgrade are not surprised by the find. Milan Nikolic, director of the Centre for Policy Studies, said: \"They will use every means possible because they are in very bad shape.\" </p> <p>Analysts say Kosovo provides fertile ground for dirty tricks - 300 polling stations will be open, but it will hard for non-governmental groups to verify the results. A second area of concern lies in the two electoral districts in southern Serbia: Prokuplje and Vranje, and in Montenegro. </p> <p>In addition, several hundred thousand ethnic Albanians remain registered to vote in Yugoslavia and analysts fear their votes could be appropriated. </p> <p>The Kostunica coalition, the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (Dos), is taking strenuous measures to curb voting fraud. </p> <p>Its campaign manager, Zoran Djindjic, said almost every polling station in Serbia and Montenegro will have a Dos member on its electoral board, but that the coalition had been denied such representation in southern Serbia and Kosovo. </p> <p>He said Dos was unable to monitor much of the election process. \"The voting lists are made by police. The polls are controlled by the government.

  "A George W Bush administration could delay the decision on America's controversial national missile defence system until 2002. <p>Mr Bush wants time to assess all the options on missile defence if he is elected president in November, and he may not ask Congress for funding for new programmes until the January 2002 budget, his chief foreign policy adviser, Condoleezza Rice, told a press briefing. </p> <p>Mr Bush does not intend to be any more precise about his defence thinking and military spending plans during the remaining phases of the election campaign, she added. </p> <p>\"He is an excellent decision maker, but you don't have time on the campaign trail, nor really the resources on the campaign trail, to make a decision of this magnitude.\" </p> <p>So far Mr Bush's speeches have implied that he is committed to expanding the national missile defence (NMD) system being developed by Mr Clinton's administration. </p> <p>This limited programme, involving about 100 interceptor missiles stationed in Alaska is supported by the Democratic presidential candidate, Al Gore. Mr Clinton announced on September 1 that he was leaving the decisions whether and how to go ahead with NMD to his successor. </p> <p>Ms Rice's comments do not change the likelihood that Mr Bush will go for a bigger and more ambitious programme if he is elected, but they suggest that his team accepts that it will have to spend some months negotiating on the issue next year. </p> <p>America's allies and foes remain opposed to Mr Clinton's plan, which would breach the 1972 Anti Ballistic Missile treaty between the US and Russia and would involve building radar ground stations in Britain and Greenland. But they are even more apprehensive about Mr Bush's plans, because he would almost certainly like to install interceptors far more widely. </p> <p>Mr Bush wants to examine other additional systems, Ms Rice said. These may include as yet untested weapons in the early stage of development, such as lasers on aeroplanes and short- and medium-range interceptors on ships. </p> <p>One upgrade to the Clinton system most discussed in Republican circles would allow the US to shoot down missiles in the \"boost phase\", when they are travelling more slowly just after take-off and the debris - potentially including chemical and biological agents - would fall near where they were launched. </p> <p>Mr Bush will examine all these options from a technological and strategic point of view, Ms Rice said. She refused to say how many new weapons might be under consideration or what their cost might be. </p> <p>\"What the governor has said is that this is a very high priority within defence and that he will find the resources to do it, but we do not have a number.\" </p> <p>If Mr Bush wins he will conduct a \"top-down\" review of all military structures and strategies, Ms Rice said. It would be as sweeping as one which followed the second world war, which led among other things to the creation of a separate US air force. It might not be finished in time for inclusion in the 2002 budget, she said. </p> <p>\"We are at a real turning point for the armed services. It is more akin to 1946 than anything we have experienced.\" </p> <p>One reason for her note of slight caution on Mr Bush's defence plans is that he has made a series of spending promises, including a sweeping tax cut, which could put previously unexpected constraints on the amount he would have available for missile defence. In that case several existing weapons programmes, especially for new fighter planes, might be cut to pay for missile defence. </p> <p>Mr Bush continues to make defence one of his main campaign themes and enjoys a strong double-figure lead over Mr Gore on the issue in the opinion polls.</p>",
  "Like the old grandfather clock in the corner, the US presidential election swings back and forth. At first, the Republican George W Bush had a dominant lead. But when he faced a more daunting challenge than the Democrats' Al Gore did in his primary for the party nomination, the latter took the lead. <p>Then, it was Vice-President Gore who stumbled and went strangely quiet in the post-primary period; Mr Bush regained the advantage. </p> <p>At the Republican convention in early August, Mr Bush took a decisive lead, only to hand it back when the Democrats met later that month. The seminal event of the campaign, so far, has been Mr Gore's magnificent convention speech accepting his party's nomination. </p> <p>Auditioning for the presidency, Mr Gore delivered a speech devoid of oratorical flourish but so laden with substance that it resembled a president's annual state of the union address. </p> <p>Mr Gore took America on a tour of his agenda. He proposed important initiatives in areas from education to child care to help for the el derly to health reform to crime fighting to environmental protection and, in the process, touched on a dozen other popular themes. </p> <p>Now, one month later, the echoes of Mr Gore's speech still sound in the race, staking the vice-president to a small but so far enduring lead over Mr Bush. </p> <p>For his part, Mr Bush has countered by \"triangulating\". This was the strategy Bill Clinton used in 1996 to steal the other side's issues. With all the basic Republican concerns basically solved - such as eliminating the deficit (the US has a surplus), cutting crime (down 50%), and reducing dependence on the dole (also cut in half) - Mr Bush has crossed into Democratic turf to find his issues. </p> <p>His convention emphasised his commitment to education and he recently unveiled a plan to pay for medicine for the elderly. The logic of the Bush strategy is that if he can draw even with Mr Gore on the issues, he will win on image - the calculation being that barring a transplant of DNA, Mr Gore cannot win the personality battle. </p> <p>The flaw in the Republican approach, so far, is Mr Bush's huge proposed tax cut. Seeking to reduce tax payments by $1,300bn (\u00a3865bn) in the next 10 years, the nominee is betting his house that voters want their taxes cut first and foremost. But most surveys show they are far more apt to favour spending on education, gun control, police, and help to impoverished areas. </p> <p>Either side can win this contest. But it is worth noting that not since 1948 has the candidate who is behind at this stage come back to win the election. </p> <p>Richard Nixon in 1960, Hubert Humphrey in 1968, and Gerald Ford in 1976 all came close, but none won.

  "The Elys\u00e9e palace fiercely denied yesterday fresh allegations in the authoritative daily Le Monde that the French president, Jacques Chirac, was directly involved in a vast covert funding operation for his RPR party while he was mayor of Paris in the 1980s. <p>\"The reported allegations are false. The way in which the president is being blamed today is disgraceful,\" Mr Chirac's office said in a statement. His spokeswoman, Catherine Colonna, said the accusations were \"shameful\" and \"opened the door to all sorts of manipulations\".</p> <p>Le Monde published a two-page transcript of what it said was a videotape recorded, with the help of a television producer, by a former property developer and member of the Gaullist RPR's central committee, Jean-Claude M\u00e9ry, three years before he died in 1999.</p> <p>Mr M\u00e9ry said the RPR, which Mr Chirac founded, was financed through rake-offs from public works contracts in the Paris region when the president was mayor.</p> <p>\"We worked only on orders from Mr Chirac,\" he said during the hour-long tape, describing how he handed over some \u00a3500,000 to an RPR official in the presence of Mr Chirac in 1986.</p> <p>The transcript also quotes Mr M\u00e9ry as saying that the cash payments to the RPR reached a total of \"\u00a33.5m to \u00a34m every year for more than seven years, under my direction\". He reportedly told the producer, Arnaud Hamelin, that he wanted to \"tell the truth\".</p> <p>Mr Chirac did not comment on the charges, but Ms Colonna said Mr M\u00e9ry's accusations contradicted testimony he had made to investigating magistrates both before and after he recorded the videotape.</p> <p>\"In a democracy, justice must prevail over slander,\" she said. She added that the videotape should be handed over to a state prosecutor who would investigate why it had not been handed over to magistrates.</p> <p>The justice minister, Elisabeth Guigou, said it would be up to the judiciary to decide what to do with the tape.</p> <p>In its editorial, Le Monde acknowledged that in publishing what it called \"an exceptional document\" it was taking a risk. \"But since this is a matter in which the very functioning of democracy in France is at stake, we feel it is our duty to take that risk,\" it said.</p> <p>The accusations are the most direct so far against Mr Chirac, who was mayor of the French capital from 1977 until his election to the Elys\u00e9e in 1995. His name has also been linked with an employment scandal in which hundreds of RPR activists were allegedly paid by the town hall to perform non-existent jobs.</p> <p>Some 50 businessmen and politicians, including the current mayor of Paris, Jean Tiberi, and a former RPR prime minister, Alain Jupp\u00e9, have been placed under formal investigation - one step short of being charged - in the long-running probe into RPR funding.</p> <p>Despite the mounting evidence that he was at least aware of the wrongdoing, Mr Chirac is unlikely to be prosecuted in the very near future: France's highest court ruled last year that French presidents are immune from prosecution except for high treason.</p>"
