  "Robin Cook's ethical foreign policy has suffered a severe setback after his bill to regulate the arms trade failed to secure a place in the government's autumn legislative programme. <p>Labour will be open to accusations of hypocrisy by going into the general election without having implemented the recommendations on arms brokering made by Sir Richard Scott, who conducted the inquiry into the arms-to-Iraq affair. The Foreign Office had been keen to put through the legislation to send a positive signal to counter criticism it has faced over dubious arms sales to countries such as Indonesia, Pakistan and Zimbabwe.</p> <p>The revelation that the measure has not been included in the Queen's Speech is an embarrassment to Mr Cook, who made his parliamentary reputation in opposition by hounding the then Conservative government in 1996 over the arms-to-Iraq affair. Over the last few months, Mr Cook and the trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers, fought hard in private Whitehall meetings for parliamentary time for the arms bill.</p> <p>They were backed by the defence secretary, Geoff Hoon. But they were overruled on the ministerial committee that decides what bills should be included in November's speech.</p> <p>The arms bill, which had already been drafted by the Department of Trade and Industry, would have forced Britons involved in the export of arms to be licensed. At present, the trade is governed by loose legislation introduced in 1939.</p> <p>The US and other countries within the European Union, such as Germany and Sweden, license companies selling arms abroad. Licences are withheld from dealers regarded as dubious.</p> <p>Spokesmen for the Foreign Office and the Department of Trade yesterday stuck to the standard government formula when asked about the Queen's Speech, saying they could not anticipate its contents.</p> <p>But Whitehall sources close to the ministerial negotiations confirmed the bill had dropped off the list. \"The bill is dead,\" one said.</p> <p>As the Queen's Speech is almost certainly the last before the general election, Labour is designing one that will have electoral appeal, devoted to health, education and crime. The arms industry is not regarded as a vote-winner.</p> <p>Expectations that the bill would be in the Queen's Speech were raised in February when Department of Trade officials were given the go-ahead to begin drafting, which normally guarantees a slot. A white paper on strategic export controls had first been published by the Department of Trade in 1998.</p> <p>This proposed \"to control the involvement of persons in the UK or UK persons abroad in trafficking and brokering in arms and other controlled goods to any country subject to an embargo\". Those breaking the proposed law would be subject to criminal charges.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, Menzies Campbell, said last night: \"Labour promised much in opposition when it reaped the dividend of Tory cynicism over arms-to-Iraq. To fail to make the necessary changes in legislation in the course of a parliament hardly suggests the kind of commitment to change for which Labour argued when the Scott report was published.\"</p> <p>Kevin Mullen, a spokesman for the Campaign Against the Arms Trade, expressed disappointment: \"Tough controls are required to stop UK nationals profiting from conflict hot spots. If the government fails to act, it will be yet another disappointing episode on this issue, considering their promises to control illicit arms sales and their posturing on the problem of blood diamonds.\"</p> <p>The Foreign Office has led a campaign this year to restrict the sale of diamonds from Sierra Leone, Angola and the Congo that contribute to their civil wars.</p> <p>Paul Eavis, director of Saferworld, another campaign group, said: \"It is outrageous that the government is not bringing forward legislation to tackle the problems caused by arms brokers and shipping agents.\"</p> <p>In the last year, Mr Cook has been overruled several times by Tony Blair, who came down in favour of Mr Byers and Mr Hoon in allowing contentious arms sales. But Mr Byers was an enthusiast for this bill. To a lesser extent, so was Mr Hoon.</p>",
  "The land of the free now wields an absolute power, free of responsibility, such as the world has never known. The rest of the globe watches its elections with renewed anguish as powerless spectators and demi-subjects. The two conventions displayed all that is most repugnant and alien in a political system corrupted beyond recognition in the democratic world. <p> The $100m campaigns lift off in an obscene haze of sanctimonious, lachrymose religiosity, oozing family unction and lies. With 77 days to go and contenders neck and neck in the polls, George W Bush says that Jesus is his guiding influence, Al Gore and Joe Lieberman share a prayer with reporters and both campaigns promise instant gratification and no sacrifice for anything or anyone ever. Dishonest fantasy politics turn America into an out-of-control, self-absorbed, infantilised monster. </p> <p>The richer, stronger and more globally unaccountable America becomes, the more self-centred its politics grows. The end of the cold war should have brought great psychological dividends. Generous in global victory, free of paranoia and with wealth beyond imagining, here at last was its chance to become what it has always believed itself to be - the brave, the beautiful, the free and so on. </p> <p>The high-flown rhetoric of the conventions is echoed in every high school valedictory speech, in every rotary and church, pledging allegiance to a constitution that has lost any vision of society beyond the pursuit of happiness. God's chosen people, uniquely blessed, nurture a self-image almost as deranged in its profound self-delusion as the old Soviet Union. The most advanced, knowledgeable, educated, psychoanalysed, therapised nation on earth knows nothing of itself, irony-free and blind to the world around it. </p> <p>This is the indictment: </p> <p>\u0095 Global warming: both poles are now melting and the process can never be stopped or reversed without America. The US federal government report on climate change itself predicted a 5-10C heat increase this century, with attendant fires, droughts and floods. A quarter of the world's population consumes 80% of its energy, most in the US. At Kyoto the US agreed to a very modest 7% cut in emissions by 2010. Congress refused to ratify it and since then America's emissions have increased by over 20%. </p> <p>The Republicans deny the cause of global warming, Democrats say nothing of cuts. As a result other countries are now sliding out of Kyoto promises, finding loopholes. Why should politicians in France or Germany take huge political pain in demanding cuts from their voters when the monster across the Atlantic goes on guzzling? With global power should come global responsibility to lead, but it doesn't. </p> <p>\u0095 Defence: Congress's refusal to sign the comprehensive test ban treaty last October virtually urges others to acquire their own weapons. The Bush camp talks of tearing up the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty. Both parties are committed to the insane national missile defence system, putting the US under an umbrella protecting it from imaginary threats by \"rogue\" states that might lob a missile across, presumably unafraid of retaliation. It will end the old mutually assured destruction policy by which the world survived the cold war. Costing $60bn, it works even less well than the smart bombs of recent wars but still arouses fear and anger in China and Russia. Zbigniew Brzezinski calls it the mentality of the \"internationally gated community\". </p> <p> Such isolationism will make the US role as a good global police force less likely: already political cowardice at losing any US soldier's life damaged its moral credibility in a genuinely unself-interested intervention in Kosovo. </p> <p>\u0095 The third world: the US promised $600m towards the relief of third-world debt, with 25 countries partly aided by the end of this year. Not a penny has been paid because Congress refused. The rhetoric was good - a recent US poll showed half the population thought the problem already solved - but even Uganda, the exemplary \"good\" poor country, has still received nothing. </p> <p>Following US parsimony, the EU and Japan have been dragging their heels too. If the world's richest country, whose GNP has risen by a third in five years, hasn't paid, why should anyone else? Then there are the world trade negotiations, wrecked instead of saved by US political selfishness. </p> <p>\u0095 Poverty: a nation that does next to nothing about its own poor is unlikely to offer much to other countries. While US stock market values have increased five-fold in a decade, with half of all shares owned by 1% of the people, welfare has been cut to a five-year lifetime limit. With 40% of the people not covered by medical insurance, Medicare for the elderly is being cut by $115bn - and the Republicans promise far worse to come. </p> <p>Virtually all the income gains of the last five years have been enjoyed by the top 20% of the population. The real value of the minimum wage is still below what it was in John F Kennedy's day, income distribution as unequal as in the 1920s. (Bill Gates' wealth is equal to that of the entire bottom 40% of the nation). The poor go to jail in a country that imprisons more than any dictatorship - 5% of adult males are under \"correction\". Some 3,500 people await execution on death row; 580 have been executed since the Supreme Court lifted its ban. </p> <p>This is not the portrait of a civilised modern state. We are deceived by history. We are deceived by the myriad rainbow wonders of America, this mighty engine of invention and imagination, of creativity and enthusiasm from sea to shining sea. Europeans visit New York, San Francisco or Cape Cod, read the great American novelists and intellectuals, revel in America's popular culture, films and art and admire the super-sophistication of its academic discourse.</p> <p> It's rather like visiting St Petersburg before the revolution, wondering at the brilliance of Tolstoy, Pushkin, Chekhov, Dostoevsky or maybe Faberg\u00e9, while trying to disregard the Tsar. The US constitution is kept on a mighty altar and lowered into a bomb-proof shelter at night as if it were indeed the guarantor of freedom: all it proves is that constitutions, freedoms of speech or information are only a small part of a good society. (The Soviet constitution was a pretty good document too.) </p> <p>In elections there is always a better and worse. Bush is terrifying - in hock to oil and arms, promising a $1.3 trillion tax cut to the exclusive benefit of the top few. Gore is better. But whoever wins, America's dismal failure to address the key questions with any realism must strengthen European resolution on future unity. The life, views, values, ideas and politics of any town or village anywhere in the EU feels much more like home than any small town in middle America these days. The more we look at alien America, the more European we feel and the stronger we need to become. </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\"> polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p><strong> Mousehunt</strong> </p> <p>(Gore Verbinski, 1997) </p> <p>9.30am, 6pm, Sky Premier </p> <p>Nathan Lane and Lee Evans are dimwit, Laurel-and-Hardy-like brothers who inherit dad's string factory and a crumbly mansion. There's a string attached, too, in the form of a mouse (pictured) with a territorial sense that would put a pitbull to shame. Just the thing for the school holidays. </p> <p><strong> Lolita</strong> </p> <p>(Stanley Kubrick, 1961) </p> <p>9pm, TCM </p> <p>James Mason took Humbert Humbert role after David Niven, Rex Harrison and Noel Coward turned it down, no doubt blanching at the challenge of the arrogant paedophile from Nabokov's novel. Mason comes over as broadly sympathetic, if stuffy, while Sue Lyons scoffs her way through as the knowing nymphet - whose age is nervously increased to 14 from the book's 12. Better are Shelley Winters as her frustrated mum, Peter Sellers as the menacing Quilty. It lacks Nabokov's acidity and is hamstrung by being filmed in England - very obviously thousands of miles from its American mid-West setting, but is a braver stab than Adrian Lyne's later version. </p> <p><strong> Gorky Park</strong> </p> <p>(Michael Apted, 1983) </p> <p>1am, Carlton Cinema </p> <p>A chilly thriller set in a KGB-ridden Moscow, adapted by Dennis Potter from Martin Cruz Smith's bestseller. Wry and wan William Hurt is excellent as investigator Arkady Renko, called in after the discovery of three frozen, mutilated corpses in the park. Brian Dennehy's rogue New York cop and Lee Marvin's menacing businessman are the wild cards. </p> <p> <strong> Bande A Part</strong> </p> <p>(Jean-Luc Godard, 1964) </p> <p>1am, FilmFour </p> <p>One of Godard's finest, with all the playful technique which made his early films so endearing, even if it is about three people plotting to swindle an old lady. But the plot is only half the story. Anna Karina does her wide-eyed ing\u00e9nue thing again, this time charming two juvenile friends (Claude Brasseur and Sami Frey) into crime.</p>"
