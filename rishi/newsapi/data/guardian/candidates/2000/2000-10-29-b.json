  "<p>American elections have a tradition of nastiness and dirty tricks that even pre-dates that universal scapegoat, the television set. Long before Nixon's buggers set about the Watergate headquarters, newspapers were complaining: \"The American people are disgusted by the unseemly exhibition of the President of the United States and a Presidential candidate quarrelling like angry fishwives\" ( New York Herald, 1908). </p> <p>A 100 years earlier, the primary author of the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson, was branded an atheist, swindler and traitor by his political opponents. And it was the New York Evening Post that wrote: \"To elect their own rulers is, indeed, a great privilege of free citizens, but the principles and methods by which they have come to select them for election are execrable.\" That was as recently as 1872. </p> <p>Into this long tradition of insult-trading and sharp practice stepped the most powerful political communicator of all: television. In its American incarnation - rampant commercialism and a no-holds-barred approach to political advertising - television is not the ideal medium for raising the level of political discourse. </p> <p>Candidates can beat the proverbial living daylights out of each other for as long as their funds allow them to spend money on extortionate 30-second TV spots. Objections are drowned out by the twin mantras of free speech and free market as commercial networks greedily count the dollars from their quadrennial political windfall. One Wall Street firm is predicting that political ads this year will bring in $1bn, twice as much as in 1996. That's more than 9% of all advertising revenue, and rising. It's enough to make ITV executives weep. </p> <p>This is television as gladiatorial battlefield in the long-standing tradition of American politics. In such a barren political wasteland, it is scarcely surprising that the presidential debates, which have now became a standard feature of American elections, are seen as the pinnacle of enlightened discussion. And this week, we saw the first moves towards a similar event in Britain during the next election campaign, as Tory Party chairman Michael Ancram tabled proposals for a televised debate involving all three party leaders. </p> <p>Those who see this as a step towards exploiting television in the interests of democracy should look care fully at the American experience. Whatever the reality about the impact of those debates on election outcomes, there is an unshakeable belief among participants that they are decisive - and certainly not because of their penetrating analysis of the issues. </p> <p>Of the famous inaugural TV debate between Kennedy and Nixon in 1960, its producer Don Hewitt said: \"America elected a president that night' - not because viewers could judge the candidates' views on defence and security at the height of the Cold War but because they liked 'the young, handsome Catholic kid from Massachusetts better than the guy who looks like he needs a shave from California.\" </p> <p>In a programme on the public service channel PBS last month, Walter Mondale reflected on the famous but seemingly harmless Reagan one-liner in their 1984 debate. In response to a question about whether he was too old to be president, Reagan had replied nonchalantly that he did not plan to \"exploit for political purposes my opponent's youth and inexperience\". Sixteen years on, Mondale recalls: \"I could tell that one hurt. I walked off and I was almost certain the campaign was over, and it was.\" </p> <p>In the same programme, Reagan told of the months of preparation for those debates and the streams of facts and figures that were pumped into him (usually emerging in a random, unintelligible form). Many of the participants drew comparisons with head-to-head sporting events. </p> <p>The end result is an electoral event in which candidates are almost paralysed by significance. They are coached on how to portray themselves, and are far too terrified of making a gaffe to say anything interesting. </p> <p>Point-scoring, practised one-liners, incriminating document waving and invasion of opponents' territory all take precedence over serious political discussion. In a country where the alternative is opponent-bashing ads and where, according to one study, national networks aired less than a minute of issues discussion each night in the month before the primaries, you can see how live debates might seem an oasis of reasoned discussion. </p> <p>In Britain, we have rules that prohibit political ads on television and which recognise the power of the medium by ensuring free broadcast time goes to competing political parties. More importantly, we still have a significant public service presence in which serious issues can be aired at length and aspirant governments closely questioned by journalists and voters alike. </p> <p>If there are lessons from televised politics in America, it is the need to avoid Blair and Hague going head to head in a sterile and pointless display of willy-waving.</p>"
