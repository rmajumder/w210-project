  "<p>Directors of social services have warned of a round of emergency spending cuts this winter that will increase pressure on the NHS during the most politically dangerous phase of the government's health service reforms. </p> <p>They are bracing themselves for a squeeze on services that help thousands of older people stay out of hospital or get speedy discharge. </p> <p>A confidential survey of 71 social services departments in England has revealed a projected overspend averaging 2.1%. To balance the books over the final six months of the financial year would require cuts worth more than \u00a3160m. </p> <p>Jo Williams, president of the Association of Directors of Social Services, said councils would do their utmost to co-operate with the NHS to reduce pressure in hospital beds. \"But in some areas we are heading for cuts, we are between a rock and a hard place.\" </p> <p>The cuts are likely to include less domiciliary care and delays in the assessment of older people's needs, but would inevitably lengthen their stay in hospital. </p> <p>Earlier this year the government allocated an extra \u00a360m to reduce \"bed blocking\" by providing additional social services to speed the discharge of elderly patients. </p> <p>But this sum has been dwarfed by unexpected extra demands on the 150 social service departments' in England. These include more children coming into council care, more spending on services for disabled children, and more demand for services from older people. </p> <p>The survey of a representative sample of 71 local authorities found 22 are projecting an overspend of 3% or more and 27 of between 2% and 3%. None was under-spending and a few were exceeding their budget by up to 6%. </p> <p>The figures were revealed at a private meeting of directors during the annual social services conference in Edinburgh. </p> <p>Mrs Williams said: \"When we talk to our NHS colleagues they are anxious about us not being able to provide the money to get people into nursing or residential care. </p> <p>\"We will do everything we can to work in partnership with colleagues in the health service, as we did successfully last year. But there is a capacity problem and there is an issue about the amount of money in the system.\" </p> <p>Ministers are giving maximum priority to avoiding a winter crisis in the hospitals that could expose the NHS reform plan to attack from the Conservatives in the run-up to the election. </p> <p>A Department of Health source said: \"We appreciate that some local authorities have severe winter problems. They have tended to slow down assessments, particularly of older people, to delay discovery of legal obligations to look after them. While that is superficially sensible for the local government, the difficulty for us is that it causes bed blocking ... We want health and social services to recognise there is a shared problem.\" </p> <p>Rita Stringfellow, chairwoman of the Local Government Association's social affairs and health executive, told the conference: \"There is a nervousness about how we will cope this winter.\" </p> <p>\u0095 The National Council for Voluntary Organisations last night told ministers that the NHS reform plan will fail unless they consult more with local communities and voluntary groups. Stuart Etherington, chief executive, will tell the conference today: \"I have no sense that the plan recognises the fundamental importance for voluntary organisations in health and social care, and the diverse range of roles that voluntary organisations play in those fields.\"</p>",
  "The presidential race has spilled over into the cinema with accusations that a new film, The Contender, released last weekend in the US, has been edited to favour the Democrats and demonise the Republicans. <p>The actor Gary Oldman is at the centre of accusations that DreamWorks studio has distorted the character of a Republican he plays because of the studio's own Democratic bias. </p> <p>Oldman plays a Republican congressman, Shelly Runyon, and Joan Allen the part of a fictional Democratic vice-presidential nominee Laine Hanson. Her political career is threatened by revelations of a past sexual scandal. The film, directed by Rod Lurie, has already been talked of in Oscar terms. </p> <p>As far as Oldman is concerned, his character should be multi-faceted and not the villain. He took part in the project because he liked the script. In an interview in the November issue of Premiere magazine, Oldman said that reading The Contender reminded him of scripts he had in the past such as Prick Up Your Ears. Of his character, he said: \"Runyon is the only true patriot in the film.\" </p> <p>But by the time the film was re-edited, the Republican character emerged as the villain and the Democrat as the heroine and an inspiring role model for young women: the film is dedicated 'For our Daughters.' DreamWorks had bought the completed film but had the right to re-edit it. </p> <p>Douglas Urbanski, Oldman's manager and producing partner, accused DreamWorks of editing the film to fit their political views. All of the three DreamWorks partners, Steven Spielberg, David Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg, are supporters of the Democrats. </p> <p>\"If your names are Spielberg, Katzenberg and Geffen, you can't have a film with a Republican character who is at all sympathetic being released by October 13,\" said Urbanski, referring to the fast approaching presidential election. \"Gary signed on to do this movie with the explicit understanding that his character was not a villain, that this would be left open to debate.\" </p> <p>Oldman told Premiere that he objected to being portrayed as a villain and had tried to get press releases about the film changed. \"I am a little disappointed that you have a company that waves the flag for artists, and champions filmmakers such as Woody Allen and then can't honour something that doesn't actually cost them anything.\" </p> <p>Neither DreamWorks nor the international distributor of the film would comment on the row yesterday. It may have the desired effect of making people go and see the film, which also stars Jeff Bridges as a fictional president, so that they can make up their own minds. </p> <p>Elsewhere in the presidential race, the world of film has also been apparent. At the Green Party's presidential nominee Ralph Nader's mass rally in New York on Monday, the actor Tim Robbins appeared in the character of the part he played in the film, Bob Roberts. He was accompanied by his wife and fellow Nader supporter Susan Sarandon, the film-maker Michael Mann and the singer Patti Smith.</p>",
  "January 1 2001 <p><b>Mr President,</b></p> <p>You appointed us to carry out this inquiry under the terms of a summit meeting held at Sharm el-Sheikh last October. As you explained during our private briefing in the Oval Office, the summit meeting had two main purposes.</p> <p>One was, as you put it, \"to keep a lid\" on the violence until November 7, in order to minimise collateral damage to Mr Gore's presidential campaign. The other was to pre-empt and frustrate the Arab summit (which was due to be held this weekend) and so ensure, as you put it, that the United States \"would remain in the driving seat\" of the peace process.</p> <p>In order to secure these goals, you reluctantly accepted Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's request for an inquiry into the disturbances but you felt, as you explained at our briefing, that it would be unhelpful if our inquiry were to apportion blame for specific acts of violence.</p> <p>We have therefore refrained from that, concentrating our investigations instead on the underlying causes of the violence, and we find that you, Mr President, through your mishandling of the peace process, are the person mainly responsible.</p> <p>Last March you blundered into a meeting with the late President Assad of Syria, arrogantly believing you could talk him into a peace deal with Israel.</p> <p>President Assad met you because he had been led to expect an offer over Galilee, which was not, in fact, forthcoming. That meeting was ill-prepared, and it failed.</p> <p>As a result, the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, withdrew Israeli forces from southern Lebanon, hoping to weaken Syria's future bargaining position. In our view, this has also contributed to subsequent violence, and Mr Barak must carry some responsibility.</p> <p>By withdrawing unilaterally, outside the framework of a comprehensive settlement with Syria and Lebanon, Mr Barak gave the Hizbullah guerrillas an opportunity to claim victory. This raised a question in many Arab minds as to whether Hizbullah's methods might not be more effective than the peace process as a means towards achieving Palestinian goals.</p> <p>Secondly, the withdrawal marked Israel's full compliance with UN resolutions on Lebanon. This led many Arabs to ask why, if the Israelis were able to comply with those resolutions, they could not comply with other resolutions about Palestine. So far, Mr Barak has not provided a satisfactory answer.</p> <p>The Israeli withdrawal thus produced a hardening of attitudes among Arabs and provided a rationale for alternative \"violent\" approaches in the event that the peace process became stalled.</p> <p>We turn now to the Camp David summit, which you called last July. The timing of this was little short of disastrous. Mr Barak arrived with his coalition government battered from inside and outside, and barely clinging on to office.</p> <p>He was in no position to make real concessions. Mr Arafat, too, knew that concessions on the Palestinian side would leave him fatally wounded. Despite these appearances, many people imagined that after months of informal talks you must have had a secret plan which would reconcile the parties at Camp David. But you had none.</p> <p>Perhaps you imagined that your personal charms, which worked so well on Monica Lewinsky, would also work on Messrs Arafat and Barak. But they didn't. Your achievement at Camp David was to stir up the worst fears on both sides about their respective leaders, leaving both Mr Barak and Mr Arafat at the mercy of their own rejectionists.</p> <p>After Camp David it was only a matter of time until something triggered violence. Since then, in an effort to solve a problem of your own making, you have been pressuring the \"moderate\" Arab states (Egypt and Jordan in particular) into lending their weight to revive the peace process.</p> <p>You may suppose, Mr President, that since these countries are not real democracies, their leaders can safely ignore public opinion. That is not so.</p> <p>Ordinary Arabs are furious about the recent turn of events - as witnessed by the riots and demonstrations. The more you bully their leaders into supporting the discredited peace process, the more you risk widening the conflict by destabilising those Arab governments on which you depend.</p> <p>We recognise that your efforts have been driven by a personal ambition to achieve a settlement in the Middle East during your presidency - what has become known as your \"legacy project\".</p> <p>But this, we believe, is the cause of your undoing. Your real legacy is to leave the Middle East more unstable now than it was when you came into office.</p> <p>Finally, Mr President, we commend to you our report and, along with everyone in the Middle East, take this opportunity to congratulate you on your forthcoming retirement.</p> <p><b>Email</b><br> <a href=\"mailto:brian.whitaker@theguardian.com\"> brian.whitaker@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Related special reports</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/0,2759,377264,00.html\">Israel &amp; the Middle East</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/0,2759,180403,00.html\">Iraq</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/yemen/0,2759,193338,00.html\">Yemen</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/The_Kurds/0,2759,192981,00.html\">The Kurds</a></p> <p><b>Other articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=%28brian+whitaker%29AND+%28VdkPublicationDate+%3E%3D+01%2DSep%2D1998%29&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=score+Desc&amp;Query=brian+whitaker&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv=\">More articles by Brian Whitaker</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.al-bab.com/\" target=\"_NEW\">Al-bab.com</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.arabicnews.com/\" target=\"_new\">Arabic News</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.middleeastwire.com\" target=\"_new\">Middle East News Online</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.middleeastdaily.com\" target=\"_new\">Middle East Daily</a></p>",
  "The Queen, as a veteran of countless royal tours, is used to politicians on the make. She has been pawed by premiers and appraised by pontiffs and manipulated by ministers. But yesterday in Rome may have been the first time she has been stood up by a mayor's wife. <p>Her Majesty, resplendent in lilac, was supposed to be greeted by the mayor of Rome, Francesco Rutelli, and his wife Barbara Palombelli, a journalist, on her arrival at the Capidoglio, the city's Michelangelo-designed town hall yesterday morning, where she was supposed to be viewing ruins of the nearby Forum. </p> <p>But it did not take long to appreciate that the woman by the mayor's side was not actually his wife. She was no impostor but Louisa Laurelli, blameless chairwoman of the city council. </p> <p>Later the Queen, who has managed to avoid garlic on her trip, was served roast young goat with chestnuts and seasonal vegetables for lunch. </p> <p>Goat, described as more delicate than lamb, is usually served at Easter in Italy with roast potatoes. But now chestnuts are in season and they were teamed up with the tender goat for the royal table. </p> <p>Before the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh set out on their four-day state visit, Buckingham Palace sent a list of royal culinary likes and dislikes. </p> <p>Evidently, goat was not listed as a dislike. But garlic as well as difficult-to-eat spaghetti and potentially messy tomato sauce were. </p> <p>Ms Palombelli in her newspaper column in the centre-left La Repubblica dispenses agony aunt wisdom. </p> <p>Her website yesterday announced defiantly that she was too busy to meet the Queen and anyway never turned up for her husband's official events. She clearly overlooked the time she deigned to greet President Clinton. </p> <p>It has to be said that the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh appeared sublimely unconcerned by the absence of the mayor's wife. </p> <p>Mr Rutelli may yet become Italy's prime minister, as he appears certain to become the centre left alliance's candidate to go head to head with rightwing media magnate Silvio Berlusconi in next year's general election. </p> <p>His wife's behaviour would not have met with approval from the small band of Italian monarchists who greeted the Queen on her walkabout outside the Capidoglio. </p> <p>Dressed in long cloaks airing the royal arms of the House of Savoy, the family deposed in 1946, they form an eccentric rump. The last monarchist party disbanded in Italy in 1972. </p> <p>Luca Schiamo, 25, explained how much he loved the British queen. \"She is so much better than a president,\" he said, but his colleagues confessed that the monarchist group - combined membership 3,500 - has an uphill struggle. </p> <p>Today the Queen will be on another politician-alert, lunching with Mr Berlusconi in Milan.</p>",
  "Al Gore finally did what he needed to do in the last of the three American presidential debates with George W Bush on Tuesday. He scored a win. <p>It was only a narrow win, with Mr Bush once again putting in an above-expectations performance. But the battle, if not the war, clearly went to Mr Gore, setting up a neck-and-neck contest for the White House in the last three weeks before the election. </p> <p>Tuesday's debate, in front of a studio audience of undecided voters in St Louis, was much more combative than the candidates' first two meetings. Both seemed to feel freer than before to highlight major contrasts between their policies, philosophies and personalities. As a result, America now faces not just a closely fought contest, but a contest between two sharply polarised approaches to government. </p> <p>After being criticised for being too aggressive in the first debate, and too passive in the second, Mr Gore dug back into the populist themes and rhetoric which helped him build a lead over Mr Bush following the August convention season. The lead was subsequently clawed back by Mr Bush. </p> <p>At the heart of Mr Gore's pitch was the claim that he would continue the eight Clinton-Gore years of economic prosperity, while his Republican opponent would squander it with tax cuts for the wealthy. Mr Gore's advisers said that they intend to make this the defining issue of the final phase of the campaign. </p> <p>Mr Bush also took his stand on tried-and-tested messages of his own, calling Mr Gore a big spender and a big government man whose time had passed. </p> <p>At times, each man seemed to be speaking more to the converted than to the undecideds. This underlines the fact that, in an election where turnout is unlikely to exceed 50%, the candidates are now mainly focused on mobilising their core supporters through television advertising in battleground states. </p> <p>Instant polls among debate watchers confirmed the view among commentators that Mr Gore had bested Mr Bush. A CBS survey gave Mr Gore a five-point lead on the night, while a CNN instant poll gave him a two-point advantage. </p> <p>The tightness of the contest for the White House was un derlined by four new polls in swing states. In all four - in Florida, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Washington - Mr Gore had only a one or a two-point lead over Mr Bush. A top Gore adviser said yesterday that the vice-president will now concentrate his efforts in Florida, Pennsylvania and Michigan, where he arrived last night. </p> <p>\"I will fight for you,\" Mr Gore told debate viewers more than once, painting himself as the candidate who could be trusted to deliver on education and health reform, and to safeguard retirement benefits for \"hard working families\". </p> <p>Mr Bush, he claimed, was the candidate of big business, who would squander American economic strength by giving large tax cuts to the richest. </p> <p>In a moment that will doubtless be replayed many times in Gore campaign ads, the vice-president challenged Mr Bush to deny that his plan for tax cuts favours the wealthiest 1% of Americans. \"Of course it does,\" Mr Bush responded. \"If you pay the taxes, why shouldn't you get the benefit.\" </p> <p>In return, Mr Bush pointed to his Democrat opponent, saying: \"This is a big spender.\" He accused Mr Gore of \"proposing the largest increase in federal spending in years\", and depicted himself as a fresh outsider untainted by Washington politics. </p> <p>\"I don't like it when the federal government tells us what to do,\" Mr Bush said. </p> <p>One of the earliest clashes of the evening was also one of the most emblematic, with Mr Gore saying there was \"strong disagreement\" between the two men on health care insur ance and forcing Mr Bush on to the defensive about his record on the issue in Texas. </p> <p>Under pressure, Mr Bush claimed he had \"pushed through\" a patients' bill of rights as Texas governor. In fact, Mr Bush first vetoed and then refused to sign legislation giving patients the right to sue their health insurance organisations - a distortion which Mr Gore called \"unacceptable\". </p> <p>\"Here we go again,\" Mr Gore said after Bush had pledged action against the high cost of prescription drugs for the elderly. \"If you want someone who will spin a lot of words ... and then end up supporting legislation that is supported by the big drug companies, this is your man.\"</p>",
  "The most powerful woman in French politics, Martine Aubry, resigned from her cabinet post yesterday to run for mayor in the northern town of Lille, a move almost certainly aimed at boosting her chances of returning to higher national office in two years' time. <p>The pugnacious but highly popular Ms Aubry was replaced as employment and social affairs minister by the equally ambitious justice minister, Elisabeth Guigou, who has plainly decided that her best route to the top lies at the side of the prime minister, Lionel Jospin. </p> <p>Both women apparently have their hearts set on Mr Jospin's job after the general election in 2002 if - as seems inevitable - the prime minister runs against Jacques Chirac in presidential polls scheduled for the same year. </p> <p>\"It's a well-orchestrated departure for a well-orchestrated return,\" said the left-leaning daily Lib\u00e9ration. \"If fortune shines on Jospin, Aubry will come back as prime minister. If for some reason Jospin does not run, without a doubt she will be the Socialist party's standard bearer in the presidential race.\" </p> <p>Ms Aubry, 50, has won admiration for her tenacity in battling to win parliamentary and public support for most of the flagship social and employment bills on which the Jospin government was elected. </p> <p>She has presided over a fall in unemployment, ushered in a controversial new 35-hour working week, masterminded a major job creation scheme for young people and extended free welfare. </p> <p>The daughter of a former European Commission president, Jacques Delors, she has an impeccable political pedigree. Her long-awaited move to the Socialist stronghold of Lille only serves to underline the continuing importance of a strong provincial power base in French politics. </p> <p>More than 90% of MPs in the present French parliament hold local government posts, and more than half are mayors. Past prime ministers such as Pierre Mauroy, Alain Jupp\u00e9 and Raymond Barre have combined their job with running large cities, while Jacques Chirac was RPR party leader, prime minister and mayor of Paris at the same time. </p> <p>Mr Jospin has tried hard to end this French tradition of combining elected offices, but will probably have to admit defeat faced with Ms Guigou's plans. The new employment minister, 54, is also running for a mayor's job in Avignon next March, but has firmly announced her intention to stay on in the cabinet if she wins. </p> <p>Known as the ice maiden of French politics, the chic and unflappable Ms Guigou was a financial adviser to President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and junior minister for European affairs in the early 90s. </p> <p>As Mr Jospin's justice minister, she launched a far-reaching reform of the French judicial system and introduced the innovative Pacs civil solidarity pact giving unmarried couples many of the same legal rights as husband and wife. </p> <p>She will be replaced by Marylise Lebranchu, 53, who is considered to have performed well as junior minister for commerce and consumer affairs. Mr Jospin said he wanted to keep a woman in the judicial post to retain a \"more human, more concrete\" eye on judicial affairs. </p> <p>The cabinet reshuffle may have been managed smoothly, but Ms Aubry's departure marks a further weakening of Mr Jospin's team. </p> <p>Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the big hitter of the government's honeymoon period, resigned as finance minister last November to fight accusations of illegal accounting at his private legal practice, while Claude All\u00e8gre, Mr Jospin's original education minister, was fired last March after failing to win union support. </p> <p>Mr Strauss-Kahn's replacement, Christian Sautter, lasted just five months and the former interior minister, Jean-Pierre Chev\u00e8nement, resigned last month over Mr Jospin's plans to offer gradual autonomy to Corsica.</p>",
  "Debating is supposed to be something the British are good at. Our apparent verbal facility, combined with much practice put in at university, produces politicians so talented in the art of argument that Americans, in particular, can only gawp at their brilliance. This is presumably the myth that lies behind the success of prime minister's question time as an upmarket soap opera on coast-to-coast cable television. How long can it survive the fact that real debate is virtually dead as a British political performance? Along with oratory, debate is drowning in a sea of soundbites. At election time, debates between the aspiring leaders take place in Australia and Canada, in Germany, New Zealand, Holland, Sweden and other advanced democracies. But never in Britain. <p>The final presidential debate between George Bush and Al Gore, which finished in the early hours yesterday morning, proved that this form of encounter is now the only one that gives the voters the chance to make a proper reckoning. It has become vastly better than any other. For 90 minutes, interested viewers were relieved of the politics of insults, of gobbets, of crude commercials, of tiny squirts of lies, which are the currency that prevails where such debates do not take place. Instead, the candidates spread themselves in front of us, discussed complex problems, developed reasoned arguments and exposed, for the third and perhaps defining time, the very different personalities they would bring to the most influential job in the world. </p> <p>The occasion was not without artifice. Each man had spent hours training in the ring with their handlers. But by the time of this debate, after the feints and falsities of the first two, each seemed reduced, or refined, to an essence that could not be disguised. Gore was informed, passionate, combative, making an insistent case for what government could do. Bush was human, anxious, brief-laden, and determined to excoriate Washington at every turn. They civilly loathe each other. While both gave their own versions of the truth about health, education, national security and the rest, the rules of challenge and response produced a dialogue that could at times almost be termed Socratic. </p> <p>In Britain, land of debate, this has never been allowed. Originally the resistance of politicians grew out of their disdain for television: until 1959, elections were not reported by TV at all. But there were no leader debates for the next 40 years because successive leaders didn't want them. Sometimes they got close. Invariably, though, the strongest placed candidate has ducked away, or else both the big ones have sheltered behind pretended concern about what to do with the Liberal Democrat. </p> <p>But it is now so obvious that televised debate surpasses any other mode of voter education that these objections must be seen for what they are: ruses which put supposed party advantage far above the public interest. Politicians worry about voters' mistrust of their trade, and alienation from the process. Well, here's a device that can remake the connections and perhaps rebuild some trust. </p> <p>It would, admittedly, be riding with the punch of television. Instead of bleating about the rise of TV and the decline of parliament, Mr Blair, Mr Hague and Mr Kennedy would be surrendering to the power of the medium that enables them to speak direct - and some parliamentary traditionalists do not like that. To most people, however, the chance to hear from leaders in a more challenging forum than a party political broadcast matters more than, say, the identity of the new Speaker now scrambling to succeed Betty Boothroyd. </p> <p>Some aspects of the Gore-Bush debates could not be replicated here. America is so vast that even the vice-president is not well known. The debates were a journey of discovery for many Americans who are not part of a national conversation, and have only the smallest idea how George W Bush has governed Texas. To millions of their viewers these were new men, coming out of Clinton's shadow, jousting to make a mark. Britain, given the intensity of its party battle and the centralisation of its small-island politics, would more likely be putting on exhibition leaders about whom the public think they know quite enough already. There could be no displays like Bush's astonishing insouciance about the executions he approved, or Gore's hauteur in face of an upstart governor. British politics holds few surprises, except when road hauliers go into battle. </p> <p>But the style of the American debates supplies a rule book. Each took place in a hall full of voters, though only in the last were they allowed to ask the questions. The moderator, Jim Lehrer, was always a crucial figure, holding the stopwatch and keeping the candidates to the point; there are any number of British TV anchors who could do the same job, assuming they were able to master their commercial rivalries. The most valuable contribution to both the temper of debate and its reception by viewers was the ban on applause or interruptions of any kind by the studio audience. </p> <p>This last detail, so foreign to the stoked-up adversarialism of British television, was vital. But the truth is that there are many variants. Debates can be held with or without a panel of journalists, with or without controlled agendas, with the leaders roaming the studio floor or else tethered to a rostrum. The Hansard Society, just before the 1997 election, put forward a complicated format under which the leaders would have spent precise time-slots questioning each other, which strikes me as likely to prove too stilted. Rounding up a representative sample of the electorate, and imposing on it rules of courtesy as well as the job of asking the questions, would be the key preliminary to any debates that had a decent chance of bringing politics back into the realm of voters' real lives. </p> <p>The Hansard Society, standing aside from both broadcasters and politicians, would be well-placed to organise such occasions, filling the role of the independent Commission on Presidential Debates which set the rules for Gore-Bush. The prior condition, however, is a change of attitude by parties and leaders. At present Hague says he wants debates, Blair is grandly stalling, and each is preparing to take cover behind the problem of Kennedy. If that excuse prevails, it will be yet further proof of bad faith on the part of the political class. It is perfectly possible to organise three-sided debates, with suitably calibrated exposure for the minor party, as long as the will is there. </p> <p>Now that all other forms of discourse - the pre-spun speech, the empty photo-op, the contrived point-scoring, the ghosted article - are discredited, the extended debate, indispensable meat of Victorian politics, once again becomes irreplaceable. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:hugoyoung@compuserve.com\">hugoyoung@compuserve.com</a></p>",

  "The death in an aircraft accident of the governor of Missouri, Mel Carnahan, at the age of 66, has thrown American politics into considerable confusion. Carnahan, legally obliged to retire in January after two terms as governor, was the Democratic candidate in next month's neck-and-neck race for the state's junior Senate seat. <p>Carnahan had become one of Missouri's most successful politicians in recent years, though his path to the governor's mansion was not always smooth. Missouri's electoral laws allow its two chief officers to come from opposing parties. This usually works smoothly, but Carnahan had a tough four years from 1988 while serving as lieutenant governor to John Ashcroft, then the Republican governor and now the senator whose seat is under contest. </p> <p>The two men did not conceal their mutual dislike. During their infighting, Governor Ashcroft went as far as to obtain a court order spelling out in detail how few constitutional powers his deputy could exercise. It was, therefore, with considerable satisfaction that Carnahan swept into the governorship in 1992 by the largest Democratic majority Missouri had seen for 24 years. </p> <p>When a local court ruled against the state's poorly performing school-funding system, Carnahan made its replacement his major priority. In a generally conservative and tax-hating state, he managed to push through a $315m tax increase to create smaller primary school classes and significantly greater vocational training for school-leavers. </p> <p>Politically, Carnahan offset such controversial policies with a firm line on law and order. During his recent Senate campaign he claimed that his introduction of the toughest anti-crime measures in the state's history had lengthened by 10 years the average sentence served by dangerous and violent offenders. </p> <p>Though a firm advocate of the death penalty, he was involved in one highly controversial reprieve during the Pope's visit to St Louis in 1999. The pontiff asked Carnahan to stop the execution of a man who had murdered an elderly couple and their disabled grandson. After some hesitation Carnahan commuted the sentence, but carefully explained that he had done so only because he was moved by papal concern for the prisoner. </p> <p>On bread-and-butter issues, Carnahan's middle of the road policies were widely popular. He claimed to have created 300,000 new jobs with his economic reforms. He also halved the number on welfare, with a welfare-to-work scheme which was enthusiastically praised by President Clinton. </p> <p>Ironically, Missouri's taxpayers also benefited during Carnahan's two terms, from a law introduced 20 years earlier by a conservative Republican. This stipulated that, once state expenditure exceeded a specified level, the administration had to repay a proportion of its tax revenue. The law was triggered by Carnahan's continued spending on education and some $1,000m fell due for repayment over five years. One result, for which Carnahan reaped the credit, was the disappearance of a deeply-unpopular sales tax on food. Such shrewd politicking gave Carnahan another landslide victory in the 1996 election. </p> <p>Politics had been in his blood almost from birth. His father had served six terms in the House of Representatives before becoming US ambassador to Sierra Leone. After gaining a first degree in business administration, Carnahan decided to become an air force pilot, but was thwarted at an early stage by failing the physical examination. Later he obtained a private pilot's licence and regularly flew light aircraft for the rest of his life. </p> <p>Instead of combat service, his two years in the air force were spent with its special investigations unit, sparking an interest in the law. Having obtained a first-class degree from the University of Missouri, he first went into private practice and was then elected a municipal court judge in 1961. In the common American pattern, this proved to be a first step towards a political career. A year later, he secured a seat in the state legislature and was soon chosen as the ruling Democrats' floor leader. </p> <p>This seemingly effortless rise, however, was briefly halted in 1967 when he failed to get a seat in the state senate. His progress resumed in 1980 with his election as Missouri state treasurer. His principal achievement in that role was to clean up the cronyism then rife in the allocation of state contracts. His introduction of mandatory competitive bidding laid a firm base for his successful gubernatorial campaigns. </p> <p>His poor personal relationship with his Republican opponent, at first during the governorship and most recently in the campaign for Harry Truman's old Senate seat, was very out of character. His normal demeanour was that of a courteous, quietly-spoken, country lawyer. In his private life he was active as a deacon of the Baptist church. </p> <p>His eldest son Roger died with him in the accident. The governor is survived by his wife Jean and their three remaining sons. </p> <p>\u0095 Mel Eugene Carnahan, politician, born February 11 1934; died October 17 2000</p>",
  "As the US presidential race unfolds, the similarities between George W Bush and his father's former boss, President Ronald Reagan, become obvious. Like Reagan, Bush is resonating with American voters at a deep, almost visceral level, telling people his instincts, priorities, and personae at a level that is more profound than Al Gore. <p>The point became clear in Tuesday night's final TV debate. Bush was Bush. Friendly, likeable, weatherbeaten, a good man who has lived a full life. Gore was Gore. Pugnacious, determined, aggressive, a strong man who is fighting for the big prize. </p> <p>Everybody knows that Bush may lack the polish and formal training of an Al Gore or a Bill Clinton. Asked to name a book he was reading, he cited a biography of Dean Acheson, and then raised eyebrows by not seeming to know much about the former US Secretary of State. He cannot quote statistics as Gore can. His repertoire of historical anecdotes is not the equal of Bill Clinton's. He often seems at a loss for facts. Just like Reagan. </p> <p>But, like Reagan, he seems to fit comfortably within his own skin. He knows who he is and trusts his instincts about policy. He is settled on why he wants to be president and what he will do when he gets there. He may not have the right answer for every question, but he exudes a sense of self-control and confidence that inspires voters. </p> <p>Americans are falling in love with George W Bush as this election unfolds. Even when Gore bests him in debate, as in their first televised encounter, voters in the US are coming away from the debates with a deep respect and affection for Bush. Gore seems too plastic, too well prepared. </p> <p>Gore comes across as someone who never seems to have lived a real life. Bush shows that he's been through a lot, lived like the rest of us, and had his share of knocks. For a man whose father was president and grandfather was a senator, he reflects an understanding of what it's like to be a regular person that Gore simply fails to project. </p> <p>Caught between the need to attack Bush to close the gap in the polls and the dangers of seeming overly aggressive, Gore should show in public the wit and warmth which those who know him report he evidences in private. Once, at a White House meeting, Gore cracked a small joke at his own expense. When my laughter seemed a bit too hearty, he turned to me and quipped \"self deprecating humour. You should try it sometime.\" </p> <p>Bush keeps bobbing to the surface. When his candidacy first came to public attention, he opened up a large lead in the polls. Gore closed the gap with an excellent speech at his party's August convention. But, a few weeks later, Bush was back on top. Americans just flat out like George W Bush. And, for that reason, if for no other, he is now likely to be their next president. Is it over? No way. In the elections of 1960, 68, 76, 80, 92, and 96 there was a late surge by one candidate in the last two weeks. But every one of the surging candidates came up short and lost. </p> <p>\u0095 Dick Morris was chief strategist for President Clinton in his successful 1996 bid for re-election. He is head of <a href=\"http://www.vote.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.vote.co.uk</a></p>",
  "In the final, hyped, stereotyped TV clash between the fibber and the fumbler, between dullard and dunce, between the man who cooks the books and the man who makes syllabub of syllables, Al Gore emerged as America's safe choice. The Democrats' presidential candidate again demonstrated his mastery of the issues, if not the means of addressing them. Mr Gore's new watchword is \"prosperity\". In emphasising a record of continuous economic growth, falling unemployment, falling crime and rising incomes, he asked why Americans should gamble on change at the top. After eight years as vice-president, he argued, he represents continuity while his inexperienced rival, George W Bush, represents risk. The Republican would squander the nation's fortunes on tax cuts for millionaires, wreck social security, neglect education, drill for oil in your back yard, and transform US global leadership into one big exit strategy. If it ain't broke, don't fix it, says Mr Gore, the panjandrum of policy, the feisty facts and figures guy, the Mr Competent who knows how government works - and will make it work for you! <p>Mr Gore's problem, and maybe the reason why he trails marginally in the polls, is that safe is not sexy. Mr Bush came across in the debate as likeable, more relaxed and humorous. Unabashed at his lack of Washington savvy, he portrayed his know-nothingness as a virtue (a long American political tradition). He was an outsider, he said - a stunning claim given his presidential lineage. He would end paralysing partisan bickering. He would shrink federal government, trust the individual and yup, fry killers. Mr Gore was just a Dukakis-school liberal spendthrift (the ultimate insult). \"If this were a spending contest, I'd come in second,\" Mr Bush said with his trademark lop-sided smile. Here were conscious attempts to echo the ever-popular Ronald Reagan, who navigated by first principles, ignored the details, worked the 9 to 5 day Mr Bush prefers, and cracked jokes. </p> <p>As Senator Lloyd Bentsen might have said, Dubya is no Ronald Reagan. But he does have the common touch Mr Gore lacks. If this election were about urgent crises, big problems, complex choices, the Democrat would walk it. But it is not. Right now, middle America is on Easy Street. It can afford to indulge itself, take a bit of a chance. Mr Gore has less than three weeks to stop that happening. For all his worthiness, he could yet be a victim of the very prosperity he now exalts.</p>",
  "Revelations about the large salaries being paid to Kenya's civil service chief and his team of technocrats has deepened the row threatening the country's IMF-sponsored economic adjustment programme. <p>Under questioning from opposition parties, the finance minister, Chris Okemo, revealed last week that members of Richard Leakey's six-man \"dream team\" each take home roughly 50 times the basic civil service wage. </p> <p>Individual salaries were not given, but it is thought that Mr Leakey, a celebrated palaeontologist, tops the payroll with 2.4m shillings (\u00a320,900) a month. </p> <p>Joshua Ojodeh, of the opposition National Development party, told parliament that people should not be \"seconded to the government on exactly the same terms as they had with their employers\". </p> <p>The furore follows President Daniel arap Moi's comments last week that some of the stringent measures ordered by the World Bank and the IMF and being implemented by the \"dream team\" were \"too painful and too impractical\" to be carried out. </p> <p>Mr Leakey and his elite band of managers and economists were recruited a little over a year ago from the World Bank and private sector in a bid to save Kenya from bankruptcy. </p> <p>Mr Leakey's appointment as head of the civil service and cabinet secretary was greeted with astonishment because of his poor relations with President Moi. During Mr Leakey's campaign to unite the opposition behind his own Safina party against Mr Moi's ruling Kanu party in the 1997 general election, the president called him the \"anti-Christ\". Mr Leakey was beaten up by Kanu thugs and lost at the polls. </p> <p>Before entering politics, Mr Leakey was best known for his extensive fossil finds of human ancestral forms in East Africa. He later rose to prominence in Kenyan politics thanks to his success in the early 90s as head of the Kenyan wildlife service, rooting out corrupt officials and instituting shoot-to-kill anti-poaching patrols. </p> <p>Earlier this year, he and his team were lauded after persuading international lenders to resume funding following a freeze in protest at widespread government corruption. </p> <p>But the huge public spending cuts they promised in return have drawn stinging criticism - particularly following last week's revelation that their salaries are being paid with loans from the UN Development Programme, the World Bank and the British government. </p> <p>However, support for the team remains strong. The salary issue is part of a conspiracy by \"corrupt politicians whose gravy train has been stopped\", said David Murathe of the Social Democratic party. </p> <p>\"The Leakey team has saved taxpayers 18bn shillings in dubious bills which in the past would have been paid. It is quite clear that some crooks are not happy with that.\" </p> <p>Shortly after its appointment, the team oversaw the dismissal and prosecution of several high-ranking government officials on corruption charges. </p> <p>The team's laying-off of more than 25,000 civil servants over the past month has proved even more contentious, aggravating Kenya's tribal divisions. Many of the public servants had owed their jobs to family or tribal loyalty, and thought themselves protected by their MPs, who are almost invariably elected along tribal lines.</p>"
