  "King George V, the obsessively correct monarch who died after uttering the famous profanity 'Bugger Bognor', interfered so much in the military operations of the First World War that the Prime Minister threatened to resign, according to new research. <p>The monarch not only considered turning out the politicians and installing a military government in their place, but repeatedly blocked political appointments and installed officers loyal to his camp instead. </p> <p>The revelation that the king wielded such power will shock many experts because of the monarch's determination to conceal the true extent of his involvement. Documents describing the king's interference were uncovered by Professor Ian Beckett, one of Britain's leading military experts, during rare access to archives at Windsor Castle. </p> <p>Beckett discovered that, although the monarch ensured that he appeared to be on the periphery of the war effort, he was so determined to control the armed forces that David Lloyd George accused him of attempting to form a military dictatorship. </p> <p>Beckett, whose essay will appear in Leadership in Conflict, to be published next month, found that the king's interference reached such a height that the Prime Minister accused him of inciting an armed forces' mutiny. </p> <p>The climax was when Lloyd George threatened to provoke the Government's resignation, forcing the king into a more hands-off app-roach. 'He [the king] was a blunt and powerful man who believed firmly in his right to govern and was not afraid to express his displeasure,' said Beckett. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:amelia.hill@observer.co.uk  \">amelia.hill@observer.co.uk </a></p>",
  "At the giant Kolubara coalfield, 30 miles to the south of Belgrade, even the ground and trees are black. It is a sombre and funereal place. Amid the hills of slag, vast buildings and cranes rise out of a flat wasteland, punctuated occassionally by grinding open conveyor belts and pools of filthy water. But for all its dreariness, the mine and its 7,500 miners, who produce half of all Serbia's coal, is a place resonant in Serbian folk lore. It was here the Serbs fought and won their most famous victory of the First World War, when they turned back the Austro-Hungarian army. <p>The Kolubarska Bitka - the Kolubara Battle - became part of modern nationalist mythology when Dobrica Cosic featured it in his novel Time of Death. Today the mine is being celebrated for a different reason: as the place that finally brought down Slobodan Milosevic; as Serbia's own Gdansk. </p> <p>If the beginning of the end of Slobodan Milosevic's bloody reign came anywhere, it was not in the dreary corridors of power, nor in the cramped offices of the Yugoslav electoral commission which tried to steal last month's elections, but under the vast arc lights of Kolubara where Milosevic made his most serious mistake, misinterpreting the mood of a group of workers he had relied on throughout his regime. </p> <p>That mistake, as he clung on to power in his last days, was to send his army chief of staff General Nebojsa Pavkovic late last Monday night to try to persuade the striking miners to stop their protests. The general is the son of a miner. Milosevic's hope was that this would help him talk the miners' language and tell them their strike was counter-productive. </p> <p>It backfired. Instead it was the miners who did the talking, persuading the man who controls the Yugoslav armed forces that their anger and determination was such that to use force against them would be too risky. </p> <p>As Pavkovic travelled between the different areas of the huge open-cast pit he was politely received. Crucially, however, the miners refused to promise they would halt their action. And following behind him was a second military figure whose presence was to prove the key to holding the strike. This man was General Momcilo Perisic, Pavkovic's predecessor as chief of the general staff, sacked by Milosevic early on in the Kosovo crisis after warning the President that it was futile to use the army as a tool of repression there. Now Perisic was standing with the Opposition. His interventions over the next week - first with the miners then with his former army colleagues as hundreds of thousands took to the streets of Belgrade - would prove his ex-master's undoing. </p> <p>'I got to two sections of the mine after Pavkovic and managed to firm up their line,' he told The Observer yesterday. 'Then I moved on to the third section and talked to the men there shortly before Pavkovic arrived. As a result, he didn't even get a hearing. They whistled and refused to listen'. </p> <p>It was both a lesson and a humiliation for Pavkovic, an ultra-loyalist, who was totally dependent on the President. His wife is related to Milosevic's wife, Mira Markovic, and he is building a mansion in Uzicka Street in the posh suburb of Dedinje, not far from the Milosevics' former home. </p> <p>If even Pavkovic was hesitant about using troops against the protesters, who else would be willing to do so? 'I was in contact with 80 per cent of the generals, urging them not to let the army be abused,' says Perisic, 'though it was the role of the colonels which was crucial.' </p> <p>Instead Pavkovic's public statements were ambiguous - which in itself was bad for Milosevic. The army chief repeated that the army would uphold the constitution and respect the will of the people. The words were mealy-mouthed but they were enough. On the streets people interpreted his statement as meaning that there would be no intervention. </p> <p>It was, perhaps, as well. For as the full story of the past three days has slowly emerged it has been revealed that many of the Opposition supporters who poured into Belgrade for the decisive showdown with Milosevic on Thursday had come prepared to fight if they were attacked. </p> <p>According to reliable opposition sources, up to 10,000 activists were armed, while several squads of former soldiers had been specially trained to storm Yugoslavia's parliament and television station, as part of a high-risk strategy to oust Milosevic. According to the same sources, former reservists from the opposition towns of Mladenovac, just south of Belgrade, and Kragujevac and Cacak in central Serbia came ready to fight in a strategy organised by Democratic Party leader Zoran Djindjic. </p> <p>'They were all males. They were ready to fight and some of them told me that they left and said goodbye to their wives and children as if they were going to war. They had decided that they had to win. It is scary, but it worked,' said one source. Reliable sources said: 'The guys who came from Cacak are all reservists who have been actively trained for a couple of days as to what they were going to do.' </p> <p>Yesterday, as Vojislav Kostunica was inaugurated as Yugoslavia's new President, the miners of the Kolubara pit were being feted as the heroes of a week that the graffiti artists on every Belgrade street corner are celebrating as the October Revolution. And as Serbs gathered to mark their new President's ascent to office, they had other news to celebrate: the flight of Slobodan Milosevic's hated son Marko and his family on a scheduled flight for Moscow. </p> <p>The news of his escape came as Zarko Korac, one of the leading members of the opposition coalition behind Kostunica, told The Observer that they intended to press criminal charges that 'the former President had tried to order the police and army to fire on demonstrators on Thursday'. They were orders that his security forces ignored, taking the same view as Pavkovic that the game was up for Slobo. </p> <p>It was a message that was not lost on the junior ranks of the army and police, who for long had indicated privately to the opposition that to turn their weapons on their own people was the atrocity they judged too far. The crunch moment that saw the end of Milosevic's 13-year rule came on Thursday afternoon as it had become clear that police units were siding with the protesters, or at least making no moves against them. </p> <p>It was not just in Belgrade that the police surrendered to the will of people power. In Nis, Pirot and other provincial towns police officers had refused orders to come to Belgrade on Thursday to defend the capital. Even the army units that were deployed on Thursday in Belgrade - the 72nd Brigade - were held at their barracks with instructions to defend the Dedinje home of Milosevic and the presidential offices rather than to intervene. </p> <p>Final confirmation of Milosevic's defeat came from General Pavkovic himself - the man Milosevic had asked to save him - when he too finally recognised the new President after talking to both Perisic and Kostunica. </p> <p>But if Pavkovic's acceptance of Kostunica was the most important confirmation that the opposition was safe in power, the bizarrest moment was the turnaround of both Yugoslavia's Constitutional Court and Federal Election Commission which on Friday said that they had been behind an attempt to defraud Kostunica of his election victory but, since they had been rumbled, were now happy to confess the fact and that Kostunica had in fact been duly elected President on 24 September. </p> <p>It was what everyone had always known: Milosevic had attempted his most ambitious coup, and lost, by lying to the people who had for so long supported him. </p> <p>'You just don't understand,' said Professor Korac, snatching a Coke as he rushed between meetings. 'This is not a transition, it is an absolute revolution, it is a collapse!' Korac said that opposition leaders were now debating what to do as they would have preferred to take over in a legal manner. On paper both the Serbian and Yugoslav governments still exist. Korac said that it was now clear that no one was in control in either Serbian or Federal Yugoslav ministries as the former Ministers had gone to ground while employees were appealing to opposition leaders to take over. 'They are empty, no one is in charge.' Korac said that the only institution which was still working properly was 'thankfully' the army. </p> <p>One worry for the opposition and Kostunica is that Milosevic's allies still control the organs of power in Serbia. That is because in Yugoslavia's federal system most power is devolved to the Serbian and Montenegrin republican institutions. In principle, the police in Serbia are still answerable to the Serbian Minister of Interior and the Serbian president is Milan Milutinovic, an indicted war criminal. </p> <p>'We were in touch with Milutinovic,' said Korac yesterday 'but he just does not understand what is going on. These people are all like orphans without Milosevic. You know when Stalin died the people around him were so frightened they could not touch his body for 15 minutes! It is like that here.' </p> <p>And despite announcing that they intended to press charges against Milosevic, opposition politicians admitted yesterday that they did not actually know where he was. It is believed that he came specially to Belgrade on Friday for meetings with both Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Kostunica and then left the city again. </p> <p>That Russian meeting appears to have been the key to Milosevic's surrender of power as Ivanov informed him that he would have no support from Moscow if he attempted to cling on. </p> <p>Yesterday, Ivanov was coy about that crucial meeting, although he said that he and Milosevic did not discuss guarantees for the outgoing Yugoslav President during the meeting. 'I will be honest, we did not touch upon it. We spoke not about the fate of a concrete person or party, but about the fate of Yugoslavia.' </p> <p>And it is the very fate of Yugoslavia itself - the federation of Serbia and its reluctant smaller republic of Montenegro that is now on the table, as Montenegro vowed yesterday to bolt for independence from Yugoslavia unless the new President immediately withdrew troops from its territory placed there by Milosevic to prevent secession. The tiny republic said it would consign the Yugoslav federation to history unless its ultimatum was met within days. </p> <p>Tension in the Montenegrin capital Podgorica mounted as the government waited for Belgrade's response. Streets remained bereft of the jubilant crowds thronging Serbia. 'We are waiting for Kostunica to dismantle the structures set up by Milosevic which are creating horrible numbers of provocations. He should withdraw these troops now,' said Dragisa Burzan, Montenegro's deputy Prime Minister. Relief at Milosevic's fall was tinged with fear that his successor may prove even more hostile to separatist desires. Montenegro and Serbia are the last two republics in the federation of Yugoslavia. </p> <p>'We are expecting dialogue. We are expecting the West to influence Kostunica and to tone down his rhetoric,' said Burzan. </p> <p>Unless rapid agreement was reached on key demands a referendum would be called, he said. Burzan's comments reflect deep disquiet within Montenegro over the future direction for Kostunica over issues such as Montenegro and Kosovo, with some Montenegrins privately expressing deep disquiet. 'Kostunica could be even worse than Slobo,' said one. </p> <p>At issue is Kostunica's warning during the election that he would defend the federation. Indeed his impeccable credentials as a strong Serb who would not kowtow to the West was one of the reasons he won. Fears over Kostunica's policy over Montenegro are also being driven by his need to make a deal with former Milosevic supporters who want to keep ties with Belgrade. Because independence supporters boycotted the 24 September election, the SNP swept up all of Montenegro's seats in the federal parliament, presenting a formidable block which Kostunica needs to consolidate power, it claimed. </p> <p>Yesterday the people of Belgrade had little time for the question of Montenegro's future amid jubilant scenes as the city prepared for the swearing-in of its new president. The 178 deputies of the Yugoslav Chamber of Citizens and the upper house, the Chamber of Republics, elected 13 days ago, met in the Sava convention centre to bring down the curtain on the Milosevic era with due formality there was one notable absentee from the gathering - Mira Markovic, Milosevic's wife and leader of the YUL party. It was perhaps a wise decision, for as the Milosevic loyalist and Serbian President Milan Milutinovic walked in, the chamber echoed to the sound of boos. </p> <p>The mood was summed up by former Yugoslav president Dobrica Cosic who said Serbia was at a crossroads and that the revolt showed the deep suffering of the Yugoslav people. 'Awakened by terrible national losses and long suffering, humiliated by poverty and injustice in a backward, corrupt and criminal society, people decided to change that order: the federal state, authorities, economy, judiciary, education, army, police and all other social institutions,' Cosic said. </p> <p>The new mood was echoed around the Serbian capital, whose residents were plunged into despair by last year's Nato bombing of Yugoslavia and years of West-imposed sanctions. At one store, a shopkeeper handed out a bag of free bread to a passer-by, to celebrate. </p> <p>The most poignant scenes, however, were reserved for the exclusive Dedinje suburb, site of the official presidential residence, once the heavily guarded home of Milosevic and his wife. In the early hours of yesterday morning, Milosevic's opponents finally reached the gates of his former house, as cars drove through the streets of Dedinje waving flags out of their windows and hooting their horns in a symbolic gesture of people power triumphing over repression. </p> <p>Indeed, cries of 'Let's go to Dedinje!' had long been a rallying call for the hundreds of protest marches against him during Milosevic's 13-year rule. Almost every time protesters tried to reach the suburb, home to Milosevic and his close associates as well as diplomats and former Socialist apparatchiks, lines of riot police blocked their path and beat back anyone who tried to break through. </p> <p>Yesterday, however, the guards deserted the White Palace, which became his home after a cruise missile hit the residence in Uzicka street where he lived until the Nato bombing campaign last year. </p> <p>'We were in shock how everything Milosevic epitomised collapsed so quickly,' said opposition campaign manager Zoran Djindjic yesterday, surveying the demise of Milosevic's regime. 'We always though that Milosevic would not go without a bloody fight. But we were wrong. We overestimated the strength of the dictator and his pillars of power,' he added. </p> <p> <b>Useful Links</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.izbori2000.net\" target=\"_NEW\">www.izbori2000.net</a> Free Serbia</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dos.org.yu\" target=\"_NEW\">www.dos.org.yu</a> Democratic Opposition of Serbia</p>",
  "The loathed playboy son of ousted Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic was reported to have flown to Moscow with his family yesterday amid mounting anger over his father's resolve to remain politically active. <p>As President Vojislav Kostunica, 56, was being sworn in in Belgrade, fears grew about the continuing influence of his predecessor. Britain led an operation to block access to secret family bank accounts. </p> <p>Marko Milosevic, 26, his wife Zorica and son Marko Jr were seen boarding Yugoslav Airlines Flight JU132 to the Russian capital from Belgrade early yesterday morning, according to the Yugoslav news agency Beta. Marko was the most detested member of the family because of alleged links to criminal gangs and his corrupt route to riches. </p> <p>The swearing in of Kostunica, the formal recognition that he now is running the country, was delayed for several hours yesterday by a political row over whether MPs representing Milosevic's Socialist Party in Kosovo seats should be allowed to sit in the new assembly. The greatest election fraud perpetuated by Milosevic is thought to have happened in Kosovo, leading to arguments that the MPs did not have a mandate to sit in the assembly. </p> <p>One of the first issues with which Kostunica will have to grapple is an ultimatum from Montenegro - Serbia's smaller sister republic in the Yugoslav Federation - that it will withdraw from the federation unless Kostunica withdraws troops from its territory within days. </p> <p>Earlier yesterday the Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, spoke to Kostunica. Cook said later he was greatly reassured that Yugoslavia was headed for a more stable future. The European Union will meet tomorrow to discuss scrapping sanctions. </p> <p>In Serbia, furious opposition leaders see Milosevic's declaration as a signal that he will try to obstruct Kostunica. The ex-President's supporters and his party control the key institutions in Serbia and can use these to sabotage the new leader. Kostunica has power over the army, and he was expected to sack the Defence Minister and Chief of Staff - Milosevic loyalists - within hours of inauguration. </p> <p>But the police come under Serbian control and Milosevic's network, dubbed the 'octopus' by the opposition, remains in place. A source yesterday expressed fears about the role of the state security police, the DB, which has been accused of hiding documents that could have led to criminal charges against Milosevic's cronies, his family and the former President. </p> <p>Kostunica would love to oust Serbian President Milan Milutinovic, another Milosevic crony who, like Milosovic, has been indicted for war-crimes. But Milutinovic's mandate lasts until next summer, as does that of the Serbian Parliament. </p> <p>A key figure is Bojislav Seselj, the ultra-right wing leader of the Radical party and now a crucial power-broker. If he uses his vote in the Serbian Parliament to provoke an election, he could bring down the government. </p> <p>There are unconfirmed reports that Seselj met Milosevic last Wednesday evening, the day before Milosevic was toppled. Opposition leaders suspect Milosevic is up to his old tricks of buying allies to obstruct democratic change. </p> <p>Opposition anxieties were increased by the murder yesterday of Vladimir Vokam, a close business associate of Marko Milosevic. </p> <p>Diplomats now believe Milosevic will attempt to settle in Libya or Iraq if he is forced out of Serbia. </p> <p>Additional reporting by Rory Carroll and Kamal Ahmed</p>",
  "So call me a liar. I was standing in front of the New York Hilton Hotel when the limousine carrying International Monetary Fund director Horst Kohler zoomed by, hitting a bump.

But I digress.)</p> <p> So what have The Aliens accomplished with their e free-market prescriptions? An article by Samuel Brittan in last week's Financial Times declared that the new world capital markets and free trade have 'brought about an unprecedented increase in world living standards'. Brittan cites the huge growth in GDP per capita, life expectancy and literacy in the less developed world from 1950 to 1995.</p> <p> Now hold on a minute. Until 1980, virtually every nation in his survey was either socialist or welfare statist. They were developing on the 'Import Substitution Model', by which locally-owned industry was built through government investment and high tariffs, anathema to the neoliberals.</p> <p> In those dark ages of increasing national government control and ownership (1960-1980), per capita income grew by 73 per cent in Latin America and by 34 per cent in Africa. By comparison, since 1980, Latin American growth has come to a virtual halt, growing by less than 6 per cent over 20 years - and African incomes have declined by 23 per cent.</p> <p> Now let's count the corpses. From 1950 to 1980, socialist and statist welfare policies added more than a decade of life expectancy to virtually every nation on the planet. From 1980 to today, life under structural assistance has become brutish and shorter. Since 1985, the total number of illiterate people has risen and life expectancy is falling in 15 African nations. Brittan attributes this to 'bad luck, [not] the international economic system'. In the former Soviet states, where IMF and World Bank shock plans hold sway, life expectancy has plunged, adding 1.4 million a year to the death rate in Russia alone.</p> <p> Admittedly, the World Bank and IMF are reforming. The dreaded structural assistance plans have been renamed 'poverty reduction strategies'. Doesn't that make you feel better?</p> <p> Recently, the IMF admitted that 'in the recent decades, nearly one-fifth of the world population have regressed' - arguably 'one of the greatest economic failures of the twentieth century.' And that, Professor Giddens, is a fact.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:gregory.palast@theguardian.com\"> gregory.palast@theguardian.com</a></p>",

An article by Samuel Brittan in last week's Financial Times declared that the new world capital markets and free trade have 'brought about an unprecedented increase in world living standards'. Brittan cites the huge growth in GDP per capita, life expectancy and literacy in the less developed world from 1950 to 1995. </p> <p>Now hold on a minute. Until 1980, virtually every nation in his survey was either socialist or welfare statist. They were developing on the 'Import Substitution Model', by which locally-owned industry was built through government investment and high tariffs, anathema to the neoliberals. </p> <p>In those dark ages of increasing national government control and ownership (1960-1980), per capita income grew by 73 per cent in Latin America and by 34 per cent in Africa. By comparison, since 1980, Latin American growth has come to a virtual halt, growing by less than 6 per cent over 20 years - and African incomes have declined by 23 per cent. </p> <p>Now let's count the corpses. From 1950 to 1980, socialist and statist welfare policies added more than a decade of life expectancy to virtually every nation on the planet. From 1980 to today, life under structural assistance has become brutish and shorter. Since 1985, the total number of illiterate people has risen and life expectancy is falling in 15 African nations. Brittan attributes this to 'bad luck, [not] the international economic system'. In the former Soviet states, where IMF and World Bank shock plans hold sway, life expectancy has plunged, adding 1.4 million a year to the death rate in Russia alone. </p> <p>Admittedly, the World Bank and IMF are reforming. The dreaded structural assistance plans have been renamed 'poverty reduction strategies'. Doesn't that make you feel better? </p> <p>Recently, the IMF admitted that 'in the recent decades, nearly one-fifth of the world population have regressed' - arguably 'one of the greatest economic failures of the twentieth century.' And that, Professor Giddens, is a fact. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:gregory.palast@theguardian.com\">gregory.palast@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "A mood of nervous brooding has descended on both camps in the presidential race, the closest since 1960 and possibly since World War Two. <p>On a weekend wedged between two crucial television encounters, spinmeisters and choreographers are prepared, in private, to criticise their own candidate. And with the race so nailbitingly even both camps are all too aware that the contest between Al Gore and George W Bush could turn on a handshake, a gesture or the droop of an eyelid. </p> <p>The stakes are seen as so high that both candidates have called off appointments and even suspended campaign decisions until after the second debate on Wednesday, so that its fallout can be assessed. Aides in both camps conceded last week's display exposed weaknesses in their candidate. </p> <p>Gore's most embarrassing handicap is his repeated 'small lies', embellishments and inconsistencies that have burdened him hitherto - about everything from his Congress voting record to the price of his dog's arthritis pills - and continue to do so. </p> <p>The inaccuracies include a childhood lullaby that he could never have heard because it did not exist then - about which Rupert Murdoch's New York Daily Post ran a headline: 'Liar Liar'. </p> <p>Even as he tried to defend Gore while visiting Washington last week, the chairman of California's Democrat Party, Art Torres, could not explain his misstatements. 'I have no idea,' he said, 'I'm not a psychiatrist.' </p> <p>Gore said, for instance, that he had travelled with James Lee Witt, the director of federal emergency, to inspect fire and flood damage in Texas - which he had not done. Bush's running mate Dick Cheney teased: 'How can we expect Mr Gore to be straight with the American people?' </p> <p>'The press,' said Republican spokesman Bill Pascoe, 'has been much too easy on Gore. If the only thing you knew about him was what you read in the press, you'd think he was just a charming fellow who loves his wife.' </p> <p>Meanwhile, the gaffes that marked Bush's early campaign have returned. 'More and more of our imports come from overseas,' he blurted out in Oregon last week, along with a promise to create 'over 200,000 new or expanded federal programmes'. </p> <p>This was during a stab at his opponent for expansion of federal government - he meant to say 200 programmes. In another speech, 'peacekeepers' become 'pacemakers' and he confused a trillion with a million. </p> <p>While such blunders of speech are seen as part of the folksy image Bush's spinmeisters have created, they are coming so thick and fast as to make him vulnerable to Gore. In the current issue of Vanity Fair, Gail Sheehy diagnoses Bush as dyslexic - a claim he rebuffed by saying: 'this woman who knew I had dyslexia - I never interviewed her!' </p> <p>Bush's opponent is, by contrast, one of the most formidable debaters in modern US history, taking the advice his mother slipped him on a note during a debate in 1988: 'Smile. Relax. Attack.' But his advisers in Washington told him not to be too aggressive, to 'watch his smart-ass tonality', as one aide put it. </p> <p>In the Bush camp, the advice is the opposite. 'He wanted to win pretty,' said one aide last week, 'but he will win ugly if he must.' </p> <p>But even aides who are happy with Bush's tactile campaign admit that 'when it comes to the art of debating, he is hardly a natural'. Bush's aim is 'not to get dragged down into a battle of minutiae,' said his press secretary Karen Hughes, 'he is not someone who likes to be crammed full of information'. </p> <p>In practical terms, the fact that the scale could be tipped either way means that both candidates are avoiding vast tranches of the West, South and Atlantic seaboard, in order to focus on a small cluster of neighbouring middle-American states where the vote will be won and lost: Michigan, Missouri, Ohio and Pennsylvania. There is battle to be done also in Washington State, Gore's home state of Tennessee and Florida. </p> <p>Bush has spent more of his record-breaking $100 million election treasure chest in Pennsylvania than any other state. Among Republicans in Washington, there is considerable bitterness that he chose as his running mate Cheney, who continued to fail in his TV debate last Thursday - rather than the favourite, Governor Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, who would almost certainly have delivered the state. </p> <p>Both candidates have also been chasing every vote in Detroit and St Louis, which could by themselves determine the outcome. </p> <p>The election is a curious fight for the centre by two candidates who have both abandoned the middle ground for their parties' more bellicose traditions. </p> <p>Tax dominated last week's debate and will feature in the next one on Wednesday. The differences in policy are stark: even a neutral assessment by the accountants Deloitte &amp; Touche found Bush's plan to be 'much more generous to the wealthy' than Gore's. Bush's plan is twice as expensive as Gore's - $1 trillion over 10 years - with Gore pledging to spend the difference on the national debt, education, health insurance for children and prescription drug coverage for people on Medicare. </p> <p>At Republican National Committee headquarters last week, staff were only too aware that if Bush blows Wednesday's debate and then the election, he blows a race that he once led by 17 points.</p>",
  "The shadow cabinet Minister ducked back against the wall as Michael Portillo swept down the corridor, trailing a knot of important looking aides and shuffling autograph hunters in his wake. <p>'Here comes El Caudillo,' the Shadow Minister muttered through gritted teeth, 'with his little entourage. You notice none of the rest of us are quite so grand?' </p> <p>Last week's party conference saw the final triumph of a gentler Portillo brand of ideology - welcoming to gays and worried about the inner cities - over Ann Widdecombe's moral authoritarianism. </p> <p>But it left neither of the rivals for William Hague's crown unscathed. For the ensuing backlash exposes seething resentment against Portillo within the Shadow Cabinet, fuelled by jealousy, frustration over his domination of policy, and fear. </p> <p>The blood-letting in Bournemouth has opened profound new battle lines for the Tories just when they seemed most united, and the wounds will smart all the way to the election. The original Caudillo was the Spanish dictator Franco, and his enemies usually met unpleasant ends. According to some of his angrier colleagues, Portillo now threatens to live up to the name. </p> <p>The first ripples broke on the eve of the party conference, with reports of anonymous Tory sources calling for the sacking of the mild-mannered party chairman Michael Ancram. 'An over-eager Portillista, probably,' sighed one Shadow Cabinet Minister when asked who the assassin might be. 'And the problem is they are so over-eager.' </p> <p>The famed, feared and sometimes unjustly blamed Portillistas are a mix of backbench cheerleaders for the Shadow Chancellor, current aides and ex-Central Office staffers forced out under the Hague regime, such as former press officer Robbie Gibb and ex-Smith Square aide Andrew Cooper. </p> <p>No one openly blames Portillo for the Westminster punishment beatings, and the footsoldiers, of course, all hotly deny involvement. But the suspicion remains palpable. John Redwood's allies blame them for his demotion, friends of health spokesman Liam Fox and education's Theresa May suspect them of stirring hostilities, while Ancram may have suffered for objecting to ex-Minister Steve Norris, a cheerleader for the new tolerance, becoming vice-chairman. </p> <p>'What they can do to people is terrible, and we are heartily sick of it,' said one insider. 'The entire Shadow Cabinet would be deeply grateful if he would... just buckle down to the job.' </p> <p>But Portillo's attempts to get a grip on policymaking have caused more serious tensions. Just over two weeks ago, a Shadow Cabinet awayday to a country hotel in Aylesbury ended in a pitched battle over the fuel tax revolt. </p> <p>One camp, including Widdecombe, Iain Duncan-Smith and Andrew Lansley, had pushed for days for an immediate promise of a generous Tory tax cut. Portillo had dug in, insisting on no rash moves until the sums added up. After two bad-tempered days of arguments, a 3p tax cut was finally announced - 10 days after the start of the crisis. The row was buried, but not forgotten. </p> <p>Tempers then boiled again two days before Portillo's speech, when Fox discovered it would be centring on his radical plans for private funding in the NHS. 'Liam had steam coming out of his ears,' said one insider. </p> <p>So it was perhaps unsurprising, in such a fraught atmosphere, that the radar missed the real incoming missile. </p> <p>When Roman emperors paraded in triumph before their people, a slave would follow behind in a chariot to remind them of the dangers of hubris. </p> <p>Ann Widdecombe's hurtling bandwagon, insiders said last week, had long needed a slave on board. 'She has to learn that she is only mortal,' said one. She was dealt a painful lesson last week, but remains convinced her 'zero tolerance on soft drugs' stance was right. </p> <p>Senior party sources say Hague originally liked it. 'William was pushing for zero tolerance - he supports it,' said one. And Widdecombe's speech, including \u00a3100 fixed penalty fines, even for first-time offenders with small amounts of cannabis, was cleared both by Hague and Portillo on Monday. While the Portillo camp insists he only considered its financial implications, not the policy detail, her friends retort that he conspicuously failed to save her from herself. </p> <p>'She was set up, if you ask me,' says one. Some colleagues certainly did know in advance, including defence spokesman Iain Duncan-Smith, who warned Widdecombe that it would need careful explanation to avoid backfiring. </p> <p>But all that was forgotten as, pacing the stage furiously, she delivered her usual high-octane rendition of a daringly right-wing policy. The faithful loved it. But within the hour it turned to ashes. </p> <p>Senior policemen said it was unworkable. Bruce Anderson, the Spectator columnist, ambushed her in the press rooms, bellowing that she had got it wrong. Camera crews began cornering senior Tories demanding whether they had ever inhaled. Suddenly Central Office was under siege. 'They had a very clear choice then: to stand by her or drop her in it,' said one source. 'It's pretty obvious what was chosen.' </p> <p>The damning headlines were written suggesting Hague was retreating on the idea. And as a very bruised Widdecombe prepared to face a private fundraising dinner, the conspiracy theorists gathered in the bar. Had the Portillistas, some of whom seemed to be enjoying her disgrace, helped to fuel it? </p> <p>Several of her Shadow Cabinet colleagues believe so. 'She might have got it wrong, but they shouldn't be rubbing her nose in it,' said one. But other observers say the truth is more complicated: 'It's been horrible for her, but she is partly to blame. Part of that policy had not been properly thought through, and she is intolerant of colleagues.' </p> <p>The two young men hovering nervously in the hotel foyer on the night of Widdecombe's nemesis were clearly lost, but too embarrassed to ask directions. Eventually they found their way to the ballroom where Torche, the pro-gay Tory group, held its party by simply following the sound of cheesy disco music. </p> <p>It is still not easy to be an openly gay Tory, or even to sympathise, whatever courageous signals emerge from the platform. Portillo was not at the party, choosing a constituency dinner instead: the most senior Tory present was Norris, vice-president of Torche,who also bears the bruises of past calls for more liberal thinking. </p> <p>The Portillistas had discussed the pro-tolerance theme for months, often over tapas at Goya, their favourite restaurant in Pimlico. Allies like Cooper and fellow Central Office exile Michael Simmonds knew the plan in advance. </p> <p>But it was at home alone in Belgravia a fortnight ago that Portillo finally finished his first draft - including the welcome for Tories, whatever their sexual orientation, and passage about his Spanish father. When he first rehearsed it for his team, they laughed when he pronounced his surname Spanish-style - Porteeyo - thinking it an in-joke for them. 'But he said, \"I mean it, I'm going to do it that way\",' recalls one. He was clearly going for broke. </p> <p>The ground would have been laid in an interview arranged with the Sunday Telegraph on the eve of conference, but that disappeared when Hague, originally booked for another title, wanted the Telegraph slot instead. </p> <p>It could have been seen as a plot to stifle Portillo's publicity. But the fierce rivalry raging last week was not, for once, mostly between Portillo and Hague: the immediate battle now is not to become leader, but heir apparent - and that is a battle with Widdecombe. </p> <p>She still probably has the edge among party activists, who are the key to a successful leadership challenge. But the events of last week suggest supporters are starting to listen to their heads, not their hearts. It has given the modernisers comfort. </p> <p>The Portillistas should not celebrate yet, however. For while many senior Tories - Fox, David Willetts, Archie Norman and others - side with him on a more inclusive strategy, they are not yet buying Portillo the man. They have not forgotten it was Hague who actually decided that the week's theme should be reaching out beyond the core vote. </p> <p>'William has really stamped his authority on the Shadow Cabinet recently,' says one moderniser. 'I would put money on William being leader in 2005.' </p> <p>And so the search may now just be on, not for a 'stop Widdecombe' or 'stop Portillo' candidate, but a third-way contender against them both. There is a chance it could even turn out to be William Hague.</p>"
