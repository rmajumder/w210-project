  "When President Hugo Chavez last week hosted the summit of the Organisation of Petroleum-Exporting Countries (Opec) in Venezuela's chaotic capital, Caracas, the charismatic leader launched himself as an international statesman and a champion of the developing world. <p>For those who have followed Chavez's rise from renegade paratrooper to Venezuela's most powerful president in 43 years of democracy, the way he dominated the summit can be compared to how he has reshaped almost every other institution he has been part of.</p> <p>In the year and a half that he has been head of state, Chavez, aged 45, has dissolved congress, rewritten the constitution, installed allies in the judiciary, been re-elected for six years and won enhanced new executive powers.</p> <p>He is Latin America's most outspoken leader, counts Fidel Castro of Cuba as a close personal friend, and is not afraid to incur the wrath of the industrialised world - as he did in August when he became the first world leader to visit Saddam Hussein in Iraq since the Gulf war.</p> <p>Supporters of Chavez say that he is a leftwing visionary with great popular appeal who is uniquely capable of restoring the fortunes of a country where 80% live below the poverty line.</p> <p>But an increasing number of critics say that he is a demagogue-in-waiting, a throwback to the stereotypical Latin American strongman who relies on authoritarian rule.</p> <p>But Chavez, who models himself on South American independence hero Simon Bolivar, has achieved through the ballot box more than he originally attempted through violence.</p> <p>As a young military commander in 1992, he led a botched coup for which he spent two years in jail. On his release he traveled the country to gather support for what he calls his \"peaceful revolution\" of the oil-rich nation.</p> <p>Once he was elected president at the end of 1998, he launched into campaign to dismantle all the democratic institutions and replacing them with versions in his own image.</p> <p>He closed down the congress, setting up a temporary \"constituent assembly\" while a new constitution was written. Once the constitution was approved by a referendum, he won a general election and the new congress is filled with his supporters.</p> <p>He has installed military friends in many high-ranking jobs, giving him a stranglehold on the administration of the country.</p> <p>Even though some of Chavez's former coup plotters have broken with him, saying he has betrayed the revolution, Chavez remains overwhelmingly popular with the Venezuelan poor. He has a masterful populist touch as was evident in his folksy Opec speeches. When he ended with a traditional poem, commentators said he was being restrained - he usually breaks into song.</p> <p>While no one doubts that the regime that he took over from was corrupt, analysts worry that Chavez's anti-business stance and centralisation of power is simply replacing one bad system with another.</p> <p>Venezuela's economy is dependent on oil and Chavez has been lucky that the price has tripled since he took power. However, few believe that the price will stay as high and once it drops the country will face more difficulties.</p> <p>As things stand, despite Venezuela having the largest oil reserves outside the Middle East, the nation of 24m people already has one of the worst poverty rates in Latin America.</p> <p>With the Opec summit giving him the appearance of a world statesman, the high price of oil alleviating pressures on the economy and the six-year mandate won in August, Chavez is currently enjoying a better-than-expected political honeymoon.</p> <p>He now has all the powers he desired to implement his \"revolution\". But it remains to be seen whether he can bring long-term prosperity to the country that he has already renamed the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.</p>",
  "Russian President Vladimir Putin today offered to host talks between Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica to resolve Belgrade's election crisis. <p>A Kremlin statement issued while Mr Putin was flying to India on a visit referred to both men as candidates in the second round of the Yugoslav presidential election - an implicit recognition of the official first round results. </p> <p>\"As president of Russia I am prepared to receive in the next few days in Moscow both candidates who have gone through to the second round...to discuss means of finding a way out of the current situation,\" the statement said. </p> <p>But Yugoslav ambassador Borislav Milosevic, Mr Milosevic's brother, was quoted by Interfax news agency as saying no Russian mediation was needed to resolve the impasse.</p> <p>Mr Putin has taken an active role to broker a deal that would ease Mr Milosevic out of power to enhance the Russian leader's image as a statesman. The Russian president launched his diplomatic gambit after intensive talks over the weekend with US President Bill Clinton and European leaders. </p> <p>Russia has conceded that Mr Kostunica won the poll in the first round. </p> <p>Moscow played a key role in persuading Mr Milosevic to pull Serbian forces out of Kosovo last year, bringing an end to Nato's air campaign against Belgrade and the Serb province, and Russia can expect to win the west's gratitude if it can persuade Mr Milosevic to step down peacefully.</p> <p>Less than a week remains before Sunday's scheduled run-off elections. Mr Milosevic says Mr Kostunica failed to achieve an outright victory in the September 24 elections and a second round is needed. The opposition, backed by the West, insists Milosevic rigged the voting. </p> <p>\"It's up to the people...whether they are going to stand for this or not,\" said retired General Wesley Clark, who led Nato's 78-day air war against Yugoslavia last year. </p> <p>In the current campaign of protests, road blockades temporarily blocked traffic on one bridge in the capital, Belgrade, while city transit workers staged a two-hour walkout. The blockade appeared stronger in cities and towns outside Belgrade, bringing life to a virtual standstill in the central and southern industrial heartland towns like Cacak, Pancevo and Uzice. </p> <p>Mr Milosevic has so far held the military and police in check. He may be running out of options as some vital industries, such as coal mines, join the opposition ranks. The independent Beta news agency reported that 500 policemen entered the Kolubara mine, the nation's largest, late Sunday. </p> <p>The action could be an attempt to thwart sabotage at the mine, about 25 miles south of Belgrade, where thousands of workers have walked out. Already, thousands of workers have left key industries in a nation battered by international sanctions.</p> <p>Only essential public services were operating in several cities. \"They are sending a strong message to Milosevic: 'Your time in office is over,\"' said the US national security council spokesman PJ Crowley in Washington. </p>",
  "<p>There are two nets - divided only by the Atlantic. And never has that ocean seemed as wide as during the party conference season, ending with the Tories in Bournemouth this week. </p> <p>Firstly, there was the net of legend. A forum for democratic Athenian debate, where information would be widely available to everyone. In secretive countries such as Britain, it would herald a new age of glasnost. Information would really be free and government would not be able to hide from unflattering stories. </p> <p>Then, there's the net of fact: difficult to work your way around, confusing and bamboozling - in the same manner that the Sir Humphrey Applebys of this world pile official documents onto the desks of ministers. </p> <p>At first glance, Britain is overrun with online political coverage. There's sites such as YouGov (<a href=\"http://www.yougov.com\">www.yougov.com</a>) and at the Labour party conference last week, delegates roamed the halls wearing the neck lanyards of conference sponsors ePolitix (<a href=\"http://www.epolitix.com\">www.epolitix.com</a>) which describes itself grandly as \"Britain's leading political and parliamentary website\" and is run by the publishers of the House Magazine. Seasoned correspondent Robin Oakley, the former BBC political editor now at CNN.com's European operation, could be seen at work - and both ourselves and BBC Online had a presence. </p> <p>But while these sites are, well, great, there's something missing. If you really want to be inspired by the way online journalism covers politics, you have to point your mouse to the US. There, democracy online really does have a meaning. </p> <p>The first thing I have to say is that we have an interest ourselves - Guardian Unlimited is presently planning its own political site. But all UK political sites have lessons to learn from the US. </p> <p>It's not just because technology is bound up with US politics now (Microsoft has spent more than $15m lobbying and contributing to the Republican and Democrats since 1997, according to a report from US campaigning group Common Cause published last week). It's also that the web has been turned into a well-oiled machine for covering big and little politics in a way users can understand and relate to. </p> <p>While the next election will be Britain's first e-election, with online reporters competing for user share as hard as their print counterparts, the election for US president in November will be the first where the net may actually influence the result. </p> <p>For the candidates, the net is an essential marketing and fundraising tool. Millions of dollars have been raised online for them, and the US TV networks compete wildly for online coverage of the party conventions. </p> <p>What's striking besides the sheer amount of space devoted to politics is that there's a voice and attitude to US political websites. By and large - and bizarrely, considering the combative nature of British papers - UK online political coverage tends towards the respectful. In the US, if a site is not taking the mickey out of a candidate it is pressing hard for answers to difficult questions. </p> <p>Subverting the po-faced official sites, well-designed spoof sites have become the bane of high-profile politicians - to the extent that the Bush campaign tried to buy up unflattering site addresses to reduce the options for opponents. He had good reason: one of the strongest spoof sites in the US is <a href=\"http://www.gwbush.com\">www.gwbush.com</a>, which has twisted rap star Eminem's The Real Slim Shady into a game where the Republican vice-presidential nomination jives to The Real Dick Cheney. </p> <p> The candidates themselves are not averse to getting down and dirty online. The Republicans have set up <a href=\"http://www.Gorewillsayanything.com\">Gorewillsayanything.com</a>, a comprehensive list of negative attacks on the vice-president. The Republican National Committee produces the Goreinventionconvention.com and <a href=\"http://www.Gorepollution.com\">Gorepollution.com</a> sites, which are pretty self-explanatory. The Democrats have hit back with similarly aggressive sites such as <a href=\"http://www.IknowwhatyoudidinTexas.com\">IknowwhatyoudidinTexas.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.MillionairesforBush.com\">MillionairesforBush.com</a>. The sites are considered significant enough by the parties for them to accuse each other bitterly of online negative campaigning. </p> <p>And while the big UK parties' sites have improved massively in the last year (the Labour party relaunched its site last week with live webcasts from the conference and full speeches), it's hard to imagine them displaying the flair and imagination - and cash - of their US counterparts. Some would say it's just a reflection of the difference in political culture. In the US, citizens demand access to information from their servants. In the UK, subjects accept what they are given and expect information to be handed to them. </p> <p>That is a view reflected by much of Britain's online political coverage. But I don't believe that. It's just up to the web to prove them wrong.</p> <p> &amp;149; Simon Rogers is deputy editor of Guardian Unlimited</p>",
  "And so the agenda moves on, as agendas tend to do. It is three long weeks since the worst of the fuel fracas. The prime minister has delivered a widely admired prime ministerial address to his conference. The chancellor has kissed his pretty new lady in red. There are disgruntled senior citizens and difficult Danes to think about now. <p>A certain insouciance, indeed, begins to infect Labour thinking. One poll, at least, shows them marginally on the mend. John Prescott is suddenly cocky enough to hurl insults at the petrol blockaders. Lord Macdonald of Tradeston (Lord Nuts-and-bolts of Transport) boldly informs his fellow peers that he sees nil need for apologies. \"No group should seek to derail democratic decision-making through disruption to essential services.\" </p> <p>The plans against any future refinery problems are in place. The government is still standing - and professes itself more concerned about the many (pensioners) rather than the few (farmers and hauliers). Even Europe, which hasn't happened yet and may never happen at this rate, seems a jollier topic for prognostication. At least Copenhagen has dragged William Hague's Bournemouth back into the old routines of never-never-hardly-ever land. </p> <p>Gordon Brown talks about \"hard-working families\". Tony Blair speaks of \"a fight worth fighting\". The rhetoric that put Al Gore back in business is seamlessly nicked - and the spasm of early September is deemed just that. A passing twitch. Ministers refer to it as \"a blip\". Such blips, apparently, come and go. Who'll remember a motley crew of no-account blipping Poujadists (yes, that word again) next spring? A blip today is a clear blue sky tomorrow. </p> <p>Well, perhaps. Just because the old gang's gone down to the seaside and spent a few bibulous days cheering itself up in a cocoon of comradeship doesn't mean the blip verdict is wrong. But it does not mean it's right, either. </p> <p>The secondary curse of the pump rebellion is that all the interested parties have tacked their favourite conclusions on to the same frail framework of facts. Thus the Daily Mail sees Euro-arrogance as the root of revolt. Thus Big John finds a fox-hunter in his tank. Thus Barbara Castle gets another chance to do her number about restoring the link. </p> <p>All bridges too far. The truth may be far simpler. Look back to the last time an elected government, after due parliamentary scrutiny, decided to levy a new tax. It had many good arguments on its side. Its proposition was manifestly fairer - especially to anxious pensioners - than what had gone before. It gave those who believed in democracy a stake in the workings of that democracy. It exalted responsible spending and penalised the profligate. And - just like filling up your car with unleaded - it was an automatic impost devoted to the greater glory of roads and social services and public health. </p> <p>You will recall Mrs T's community charge (though, in Frankenstein food mode, you'll probably recall the poll tax more clearly). The Lady, 10 years back, was still in her pomp. According to The Spectator, \"her years of government have shown that Tories can successfully risk much more than in the 60s and 70s they thought possible.\" The charge fitted \"comfortably with traditional Tory attitudes\". God bless all who sailed in it. </p> <p>And what happened? Bloody riots in the streets, not to mention Trafalgar Square. Mass campaigns of non-payment and defiance. Months of utter turmoil (featuring at least 30 Labour MPs as well as a motley crew of Trots and small businessmen that Poujade would have been proud to call his own). Result: headlong retreat - plus the head of the prime minister. </p> <p>It is, perhaps, not surprising that nobody had striven to make much of the parallel. Conservative newspapers can recite every clause of Maastricht, but the poll tax doesn't feature in their folk memory. Labour, too, would prefer to forget a tricky period when the party wriggled on the fence of duty and legality. We ought to remember, though. We ought to remember how things can go terribly wrong. </p> <p>Simply, that tax - replacing the acknowledged shamble called rates - required those who lived in a borough to pay something towards the cost of the services their local authority provided for them: the schools, the care, the buses and meals on wheels, the fundamentals of decent living. It wasn't fair that a widow living alone in the family house should have to pay as much as the family of six (four of them working) next door. It was hopeless to expect budgetary restraint when the prime customers for council services were used to getting them free. </p> <p>A tolerable case? Forget it. Those who had paid nothing were asked to pay something. They didn't like it. Those who had paid something were often asked to pay more. Ditto. You could have said that the energy-intensive house next door (all those baths and all that central heating) was environmentally unfriendly and deserved to do an extra spot of polluter-paying: but Mrs Thatcher, unlike Mr Brown, wasn't into green stuff. The brutal fact was that it wouldn't have mattered, any more than the debating lines of harassed ministers at the dispatch box mattered. </p> <p>The community charge was a charge too far. It, too, was unfair. Those who had more should pay more. The demonstrators went wild. The quieter populace looked on benignly, silently applauding. People power wrecked Westminster power. </p> <p>Sorry? Got the message? Absolutely: the message was unmistakable. Exit Thatcher, enter Major (and Heseltine pouring treacle over the remnants of poll taxation). And the lessons were easy. Politicians aren't always good at knowing what they can sell. Errors and delusions pile on top of each other. The public can demand a change of course and leaders who don't listen can wind up blobs. </p> <p>When you fill up your tank these days, it maybe costs you \u00a340 not \u00a330. Extrapolate that across a year and the sum dwarfs anything the poll tax demanded. You hurt in the pocket. Is it \"fair\" that you should have to pay so much more than the Italians or Spanish? Is it \"fair\" that the Sunday trip to visit your aged parents has grown too expensive? Is it fair that the big cheese in the Merc just ahead should have to fork out the same per litre as you in your battered Peugeot? </p> <p>I don't embrace any of these arguments. But they are arguments and they impact on voters again and again, every time they stop at a filling station. That was why the 2,000 or so \"Poujadists\" operated with such massive - and strongly continuing - support. That is why Tony Blair's popularity ratings are so unimaginably lousy, speech or no speech. That is why the blip merchants may one day be blobs themselves. It's the gut economy, stupid. And the word to hang on to, alas, may just be \"stupid\". </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:peter.preston@theguardian.com\">peter.preston@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Wilbur Storey, a rambunctious editor of the Chicago Times around the time of the Civil war, used to instruct his reporters: \"When there's no news, send rumours\". In the lull before tomorrow's big television debate between Gore and Bush, the most interesting rumour is that the Republican party leadership is plotting to dump \"Big Time\" Dick Cheney as the running mate to Bush. <p>A few weeks before the vote on November 7, the buzz goes, Cheney will announce his resignation, ostensibly because of signs of new trouble with his ticker. One of two good men will then be implored to come to the aid of the party: John McCain or Colin Powell. Powell, who doesn't want the job, would be hard put to resist an emergency appeal to his patriotism. McCain would jump at the chance. </p> <p>It is all devilishly cunning. Health would be an empathetic exit for the floundering Cheney. It would avoid the impression that Bush did not know what he was doing when he picked him or, rather, when he accepted his dad's recommendation. </p> <p>The small print attached to the rumour is that nobody I have spoken to in either party believes it will happen - but it is significant. It emphasises how important the running mates have become in this race. Key Republicans fret that Cheney's high unfavourables will prevent Bush taking off in these last few weeks. Either Powell or McCain, both hugely popular, could tip the balance to Bush in the dead heat the polls are currently predicting. </p> <p>The Democrats are well aware of this. They believe that Cheney is the best opponent they could have, so easy to caricature as a Godzilla of the right, the big-time oil man with enviable millions in stock options. I half suspect that the rumour originated with some Karpov in the Democratic war room to keep the focus on Cheney and pre-empt the possibility that the Republicans could spring such a trick. </p> <p> The Democrats have a different problem with their running mate, the Jewish Merlin Joe Lieberman. It's his halo. The selection of this morally fastidious man, the first Democrat to criticise President Clinton in the Lewinsky affair, jump-started Gore's ascent in the polls. It squashed the Republican tactic of making a central issue of Clinton's character, and Gore's association with him. But Lieberman has a chink in his moral armour that the Republicans have not yet exploited for their own good reasons. It lies in his insistence on running in two elections, one for the vice-presidency in the national poll and one in Connecticut, where he is a shoo-in for a six-year term in the Senate. Since even Holy Joe does not have the saintly gift of bi-location, a victory in the national race would mean that he would have to relinquish his seat in the Senate. </p> <p>So what? So this: the vacancy would be filled by the governor of Connecticut nominating a two-year senator. And the governor, John G Rowland, is a Republican who has made it clear that he will name a Republican, maybe himself. The elections for the Senate are likely to result in a razor-thin majority for one side or the other, so the loss of Lieberman's Democratic seat to a nominated Republican might make all the difference. If Lieberman were to quit now, the three-term attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, would easily win for the Democrats. </p> <p>Why should Lieberman hang in when he knows what another Republican Senate would mean for the social reforms dear to his heart on campaign finance, gun control, environmental protections and federal judgeships? </p> <p>There is no excuse in precedent. In the 1960 Kennedy-Nixon race, Kennedy's running mate, Senator Lyndon Johnson, also stood for the vice-presidency and his Senate seat for Texas. But in Texas it was clear Johnson would be replaced in the Senate by a Democrat and that the Senate would stay Democratic. </p> <p>The only explanation for Lieberman's stubbornness is that he fears the Gore- Lieberman ticket will fail and he wants to keep his Connecticut seat warm. That is hardly a ringing battle cry to the party faithful or an encouragement to the independent voters, and it corrodes his halo as a selfless public servant. Cheney could have some fun with this next Thursday when he and Lieberman debate. </p> <p>I think Bush will do better against Gore in Tuesday's debate than the cognoscenti predict, if for no other reason than that the Republicans have already won the expectations game. Gore can't do better than he is expected to do on substance. And the big boost Bush has enjoyed since he schmoozed with Oprah indicates that there is a market for his brand of genial blather. </p> <p>Conversely, while everyone is expecting Lieberman to slaughter Cheney, it is Lieberman who may be put on the defensive. Cheney also has something to prove - that rumours of his death are greatly exaggerated. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "The Kremlin has launched a high-risk - but potentially rewarding - diplomatic initiative to broker a peaceful handover of power from President Slobodan Milosevic to the opposition in Belgrade. <p>In a weekend of intensive diplomacy following last week's disputed Yugoslav elections, President Vladimir Putin spoke to President Clinton, the German chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, and the Italian prime minister, Giuliano Amato, about the increasingly isolated Milosevic regime. </p> <p>For the first time Russia has conceded that the opposition leader, Vojislav Kostunica, won the poll in the first round. Two senior Russian diplomats arrived in Belgrade yesterday for talks. </p> <p>Earlier Mr Putin offered to send the Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, to Belgrade to defuse the standoff. An influential Russian foreign policy official said that Moscow should mediate in Belgrade, checking all versions of election returns to assess whether a second round runoff scheduled for next Sunday was warranted. </p> <p>\"If it [a runoff] is not needed, it would make sense to discuss the conditions that would ensure the transfer of power,\" said Vladimir Lukin, a deputy parliament speaker and a former Russian ambassador in Washington. \"Russia has a chance to play a very big role in this process.\" </p> <p>That seemed to reflect the views of Mr Putin, who appears to be relishing the opportunities afforded to enhance Russian prestige by succeeding in some crisis management which would leave the west in its debt. </p> <p>The Russian foreign ministry confirmed that Vladimir Chizhov, the Russian envoy to the Balkans, and Alexander Tolkach, a foreign ministry official, were in Belgrade for talks with the Milosevic and Kostunica camps. </p> <p>Russian media reports suggest that the Kremlin is engaged in a high-risk strategy to edge Mr Milosevic out peacefully, but it appears that Moscow is advising Mr Kostunica not to boycott any runoff. </p> <p>Rumours have been rife for days that Mr Milosevic could flee to Russia, and that Mr Kostunica may go to Moscow for talks on the crisis with Mr Putin, who is due to leave for a four-day visit to India today. </p> <p>The key issue would be to organise when Mr Milosevic leaves power. The Yugoslav prime minister, Momir Bulatovic, has said the constitution allows the president to stay until next summer. </p> <p>This is unacceptable to the opposition, but there may be room for compromise on finding a date which allows Mr Milosevic to stay on for a shorter period or by guaranteeing his security if he resigns immediately. </p> <p>In Belgrade, Mr Milosevic, continues to ignore internal and international pressures to step down. According to one inside source he expects next Sunday's runoff to go ahead. </p> <p>Mr Kostunica, a law professor, insists he has already won and such a runoff would be an insult to the voters. </p> <p>He is trying to unseat Mr Milosevic by legal challenges, international pressure and by persuading Mr Milosevic's allies to desert him. His aim is to corrode Mr Milosevic's powerbase without violence. </p> <p>\"There must be no blood because Serbia is already bleeding,\" an opposition speaker told a rally in Belgrade on Saturday. \"We know you are tired. We know you are fed up and tired of speeches but please tell everyone the general strike begins on Monday at 5am\" </p> <p>Essential services such as hospitals are not expected to be affected by the strike but most of the country is expected to come to a standstill. </p>",
  "Workers in Serbia's most powerful industry have swung against President Slobodan Milosevic, threatening to throttle the electricity system and plunge the entire country into darkness. <p>The 7,500 miners at the huge Kolubera open cast mine, 40 miles south of Belgrade, went on strike at the weekend in support of the opposition challenger, Vojislav Kostunica. </p> <p>Mr Kostunica claims outright victory against Mr Milosevic in the Yugoslav presidential poll on September 24. Mr Milosevic insists that a runoff is needed. </p> <p>A countrywide campaign of strikes and civil disobedience is due to start at dawn today, aimed at forcing Mr Milosevic to stand down, but the miners at Kolubera stayed away from work yesterday. Many of the other 900 workers at the complex are expected to join the boycott today. </p> <p>\"Kolubera is the single most powerful industrial weapon in the whole country. It is the biggest giant,\" said Milovan Rankovic, from the Serbian electrical industry union. </p> <p>Serbian ministers including the energy minister, Slobodan Tomovic, held urgent meetings with strike leaders yesterday while industry officials attempted to persuade the workers to call off the action. </p> <p>One mineworker said the director of coal at the Kolubera complex, Milovan Zunic, had threatened to expel strikers, threatening that \"they would kick us out with the help of police and then bring people from Kosovo to work instead\". </p> <p>Police tried to enter one of the complex's pits yesterday, apparently aiming to end the strike, but were stopped by workers, a member of the strike committee said. </p> <p>\"Two police jeeps and three patrol cars tried to enter the area of Tamnava pit,\" Nikola Simic said by telephone. \"But all the workers who were there stopped them coming in.\" </p> <p>Kolubera provides the coal for the Obrenovac thermonuclear electricity station, which provides power for Belgrade and the surrounding region. </p> <p>The miners' support is a significant gain for Mr Kostunica's Democratic Opposition of Serbia bloc. In the past the region of Lazarevac, where Kolubera is based, was a stronghold of Mr Milosevic's Socialist party of Serbia. </p> <p>\"If Kolubera goes on strike, the electrical system for the whole of Serbia is damaged,\" Mr Rankovic said. \"But people in positions of power in this country have to accept responsibility.\" </p> <p>Dragan Pantic, a 41-year-old coal worker, was defiant. \"We are not going to give up. Look at what I've got after 19 years here,\" he said, indicating his worn-out shoes. He earns 600 dinar (about \u00a3100) a month. </p> <p>\"Support is huge. The election was a referendum against Slobodan Milosevic. It is possible that strikebreakers will come in. It is possible that they could make us sign that we will not strike. Yesterday we were all threatened,\" he said. </p> <p>Another coal worker, Goran Djordjevic, 46, said: \"I think this time Milosevic will go. People are ready. There's a lot of readiness here and all around Serbia to make it happen. The regime knows that Kolubera is dangerous for them politically and because of the electrical power system.\" </p> <p>The extent of the coal stored at Obrenovac is not known. Experts suggest that an all-out strike at Kolubera could hit power supplies across Serbia within a week. </p> <p>\u0095 President Milosevic's son, Marco, visited his opponents' headquarters at the weekend, and warned opposition activists that his father was still in power and had no intention of leaving, an activist said. </p> <p>Useful links: <br><a href=\"http://www.serbia-info.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.serbia-info.com</a> Serbian ministry of information <br> <a href=\"http://www.sps.org.yu\" target=\"_NEW\">www.sps.org.yu</a> Milosevic's Serbian Socialist party <br><a href=\"http://www.dos.org.yu\" target=\"_NEW\">www.dos.org.yu</a> Serbian Democratic opposition <br><a href=\"http://www.freeb92.net\" target=\"_NEW\">www.freeb92.net</a> Free B92 - independent Belgrade radio station <br><a href=\"http://www.otpor.net\" target=\"_NEW\">www.otpor.net</a> Otpor student resistance movement</p>"
