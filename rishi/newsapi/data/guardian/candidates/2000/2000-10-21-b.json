  "<p><strong> Why:</strong> I first developed this romantic notion about a mythical Australian bush town when I was on a work/study placement in Melbourne in the 60s. We were there for three months and at the end of it had three weeks to spend the money we earned. I flew from Melbourne to Alice Springs and up to Darwin and the coast. </p> <p>What really thrilled me was looking down from 30,000ft over the bush and the outback. I've been back on lots of occasions but most recently I went on assignment for the BBC and worked as a flying postman for a week. We were based in Cairns, and I went out on a five-seater Cessna delivering the mail to remote cattle stations and small towns. One particular town does not spring to mind; rather what I love about these places are the fact that they are working towns where not very much happens. </p> <p>My ideal bush town consists of one street with a hotel, a bank and a betting shop. People drive in from miles around to see the doctor or change their library books, and life goes on undisturbed. </p> <p>In the bar of the hotel, people stand around watching TV, usually racing, and are totally unconcerned with the outside world. They are fairly dismissive of strangers and are completely uninterested in where you have come from. That lack of curiosity is something I love and the fact they people are so relaxed. </p> <p><strong> The best thing: </strong> Sitting outside a hotel with my pint of beer watching the town going about its business. </p> <p><strong> My advice:</strong> Go to Cairns, hire a car and just pick a road out of town and drive along it to a small town and have a beer. Fall into the pace of the place and enjoy it. I know I have a romantic view of such places, but it is one that I have nurtured for more than 30 years. </p> <p><strong> How to get there</strong> <br> Qantas (0845 7747767 <a href=\"http://www.qantas.com\">www.qantas.com</a>) flies to Cairns from Heathrow for \u00a3739 plus around \u00a350 in taxes. </p> <p>\u0095 Himoff, The Memoirs of a TV Matinee Idle by Richard Whiteley is published by Orion at \u00a316.99</p>",
  "<p><strong> That's a bit flash, don't tell me those are go faster stripes?</strong><br> Could be, this jacket is much lighter than the traditional 3-in-1 Gore-Tex so I suppose there would be less wind resistance. </p> <p><strong> There must be hundreds of ski jackets around, so why did you choose that one?</strong><br> You're right, the choice is mind-blowing. But this is the latest thing. </p> <p><strong> So what's all the fuss about?</strong><br> If you've ever had a jacket that's water resistant, you'll remember that when it rains or snows, it gets soaking wet. Gore-Tex revolutionised that by being completely waterproof. But this Gore-Tex XCR is 25% more breathable so you stay dry but don't get sweaty. </p> <p><strong> It's still Gore-Tex then, but the key word is XCR?</strong><br> Yes, XCR stands for extra comfort rating. It's a fabric that eliminates the need for a liner, is much more breathable and virtually tear resistant. </p> <p><strong> How does it work?</strong><br> Basically there are lots of microscopic holes that don't let water in but let air out. </p> <p><strong> Are they easy to get hold of?</strong><br> Gore-Tex has kept it pretty exclusive, only allowing a few manufacturers to sell it. </p> <p><strong> If it's so light, where do you put your ciggies and hip flask?</strong><br> Don't worry. It's got three good sized zip pockets, not to mention pit zips and an elastic powder skirt. </p> <p><strong> Sounds like it's perfect for clubbing.</strong><br> Well it would certainly do the trick at a rainy Glastonbury. </p> <p><strong> So what's the damage?</strong><br> The jacket is currently available for \u00a3239 from Snow+Rock nationwide (mail order \u00a33.50p&amp;p 0845 100 1000) and Ellis Brigham stores nationwide (mail order \u00a35.50p&amp;p 0161-834 5555). </p>",
  "<p>This year's choice is positively inspiring. There's something for everyone: from a chic sporty look to technical hard-core gear and stylish performance clothing that doesn't cost the earth. </p> <p>Not only are the prices the best they have been in five years, but the shapes and colours are flattering with a lot of gear that is quite wearable on the high street. </p> <p>If you've skipped a ski season or two, you will notice the revolution in performance clothing. Clothes designed for maximum warmth used to be big and bulky, but now with waterproof and breathable fabrics the latest designs are much lighter. A new fabric that you are bound to see more of is Gore-Tex XCR (Xtra Comfort Rating) which eliminates the need for a liner and is 25% more breathable than standard Gore-Tex. (see Get your kit Out, page 21.) </p> <p>Look out for Outlast, an acrylic fibre lining that controls your body temperature by storing and releasing heat for when you need it. It works best the closer it is to your body and is used in underwear, socks, gloves and jackets. </p> <p>Gone are the days of cotton or wool long-johns that either itch or never dry out. Now you need layers with good wicking qualities, which means materials made of microfibres that work by transporting moisture away from the skin. Look for Patagonia's men's silkweight capilene boxers and Odlo's quick drying women's vests, bras and knickers. </p> <p>For the ultimate glam ski-suit, Killy Sport uses the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of stretch fabrics that combine winter warmth and high-street fashion. </p> <p>Another company new to the UK market is Kjus, with some excellent technical ski-wear at the top end of the market. Jackets feature the Outlast temperature- regulating liner. French label Eider has some stylish technical gear for men and women. Best value is a three-in-one ladies jacket for \u00a3199. </p> <p>At the lower end of the market, a Columbia ladies three-in-one jacket costs \u00a3125 while Quiksilver's ladies long jacket complete with waterproof liner is \u00a395. </p> <p><strong>Take a short cut to have more fun</strong></p> <p>A few years ago, ski equipment was markedly more expensive in the UK than in continental Europe. Nowadays, there is little difference in price across the European Union, so it is worth buying before you go to the slopes. </p> <p> The current trend for shorter race skis has filtered through to all recreational models. No casual, two-weeks-a-year skiers should feel too \"macho\" to step down 20cm or 30cm from the lengths they were used to on their old \"straight\" skis. For any given length, carving skis have a greater actual edge length and surface area, so they are more stable in the turn and provide greater flotation in powder. </p> <p>Atomic has just brought in an excellent new Giant Slalom ski with a tight radius of 22m, the <strong> BetaRace 10.22</strong> (\u00a3389). Other companies, such as Salomon and Head, have also increased the sidecuts of their GS models, the Salomon <strong> Poweraxe Equipe 10 2V</strong> (\u00a3400), and the <strong> Head Cyber Worldcup Ti</strong> (\u00a3370). </p> <p>It was all change for slalom skis last season. The trailblazers were the Rossignol <strong> 9S Pro 9.9</strong> , and the Salomon <strong> Superaxe Equipe</strong> . This year's versions are the Rossignol <strong> T-Power 9S Plate</strong> (\u00a3400) and the Salomon <strong> Poweraxe Equipe 10 2V</strong> (\u00a3400). All manufacturers are producing short slalom skis, and most have discontinued their old, \"straight\" skis. </p> <p>On-piste skis are also getting shorter and curvier. It is now acceptable even for experts to use skis that are about the same length as their own height. </p> <p>Rossignol has introduced a whole new range, its T-Power models, designed to be skied 20-25cm shorter than their other models. The range includes the <strong> T-Power Viper</strong> (\u00a3330), <strong> T-Power Cobra</strong> (\u00a3220), and a special women's model, the <strong> T-Power Saphir</strong> (\u00a3220). </p> <p>Salomon has a new ski intended to make life easier for beginners and early intermediates: the <strong> Verse 9</strong> (\u00a3240) - the bindings are mounted further forward than usual to make turning easier for skiers with poor technique. </p> <p>It's important to remember that you won't perform any better by buying a ski above your level of ability. If anything, this will cause your skiing to deteriorate, as the skis will be too stiff for you - you will not be able to apply enough edging pressure for them to function to optimum effect. </p> <p>Free-ride skis, with the wider waists but still shapely sidecuts, is now well-established with the public. They are designed to make off-piste skiing as easy as possible, without compromising performance on firm pistes. The best-known is the Salomon <strong> X-Scream Series</strong> (\u00a3390), now entering its fourth season. But Salomon also has two new free-ride models, the <strong> Scream 10 Pilot</strong> (\u00a3570) and the <strong> Scream 8 Pilot</strong> (\u00a3430) - these prices include bindings. </p> <p>K2 also has a new free-ride range, the MOD series, with a secondary core running like a rib along the entire length of the top surface, designed to give you a smoother ride. </p> <p>There are more ultra-wide free-ride skis on offer. Established models such as the Rossignol <strong> Bandit XX</strong> (\u00a3300), the Dynastar <strong> 4x4 Big </strong> (\u00a3350) and the <strong> K2 AK Launcher</strong> (\u00a3349) have been joined by Head's <strong> Monster Cross</strong> (\u00a3330), Salomon's <strong> AK Rocket</strong> (\u00a3430), Fischer's <strong> Alltrax Big Stix</strong> (\u00a3300) and Nordica's <strong> W9.1FF </strong> (\u00a3320). Volkl's <strong> Vertigo G41 Pro</strong> (\u00a3370) is slightly wider than last year's G40 Pro. They're all a bit of a handful on a firm piste, but they can take a lot of the work out of skiing powder for experts and most confident intermediates, although some models need a certain amount of speed to function at their best. </p> <p>Skis that bend upwards at both ends, so you can ski backwards, have been around since the early days of freestyle in the 1970s. But the \"New School\" movement of aerial tricks has given them a fresh boost, and Salomon's <strong> Teneighty</strong> (\u00a3300) were a hit when launched last season. Thousands of \"normal\" skiers found they could enjoy skiing on them, and the wide profile, originally designed for solid landings, also helped skiers stay near the surface in deep snow. </p> <p>Now, every company has a twintip, allowing a wide range of skiers to look trendy and have a ski that is easy to manoeuvre with. Pick of the bunch is the Rossignol <strong> Pow'air</strong> (\u00a3230), the K2 <strong> Enemy </strong> (\u00a3339), and the Dynastar <strong> Concept </strong> (\u00a3200). New are Nordica's <strong> Z-TT</strong> (\u00a3210), Atomic's <strong> Beta Free Zone Bump</strong> (\u00a3270), Fischer's <strong> Unlimited</strong> (\u00a3250), and Head's <strong> Air Head</strong> (\u00a3240). </p> <p> Salomon's new Pilot system is probably the biggest innovation in fitting bindings to skis since the demise of the old leather straps. Instead of screws drilled downwards into the ski, transverse bolts through the core of the ski hold the bindings on, via arches that curve down over the sidewalls. As well as making binding-mounting much eas ier, they allow the ski to flex freely along its whole length, eliminating the \"flat spot\" that is often created underneath the boot. </p> <p>It's important to take your time when buying boots. At the very least, you should wear them at home for a couple of hours before taking them abroad. If they become uncomfortable at this stage, you may have the option of a refund or exchange, if they are not dirty or scuffed. </p> <p>If possible, test the comfort of the boots with actual skiing movements; a short session on a \"ski simulator\", such as the Metro Ski or the Realli Ski, may give you an idea of how they feel without damaging or soiling the boot. </p> <p>It's even more important for boots than for skis that you buy a model with the right stiffness of flex for your ability. The better the skier, the stiffer the boot required. </p> <p>Many models offer \"thermofit\" systems, where the inner boot is heated for about five minutes on a hot air blower. When you put the boot on, it moulds itself to your foot and maintains its shape after cooling. A custom-made insole may also help with the fit. </p> <p>Less-experienced skiers may want a boot with a \"walk mode\" - this is a catch that allows the upper boot to flex backwards, making walking easier. But it's important to switch the catch back to \"ski mode\" before hitting the slopes. Head's Auto Ski/Walk System does this for you automatically, and is available on all models up to the <strong> Head Cyber</strong> <strong> C9.5 </strong> (\u00a3180). </p> <p>Nordica has changed the shape of the \"Exopower\" frame of stiffer plastic in their top-performance boots to maximise the transmission of forces. They've called their new design the \"Exopower II\", and it features in all their boots from the <strong> Wave 5.1</strong> (\u00a3160) up to the <strong> K9.1</strong> (\u00a3250). </p> <p>Salomon has a new range of boots, the X-Waves, which draw on design features of their racing boots but are more forgiving in fit and flex. Prices range from \u00a3200 for the <strong> X-Wave 8.0</strong> , to \u00a3240 for the <strong> X-Wave 10.0</strong> . The new Salomon <strong> Teneighty Pro Model</strong> (\u00a3250) is made of translucent plastic, and aimed at the young \"New School Free-ride\" market. </p> <p>Rossignol continues with its proven \"Cockpit\" system, a frame of stiffer plastic. This is moulded close to the foot for heightened edge control in its high-performance models, like the <strong> Freeride XX</strong> (\u00a3220), and mounted on the outside of the boot for greater comfort in its intermediate models, such as the <strong> Salto GTX</strong> (\u00a3170). </p> <p> <strong> Where to buy</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Snow+Rock</strong> nationwide and mail order 0845 100 1000, </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.snowandrock.com\">www.snowandrock.com </a> </p> <p> <strong>Lillywhites</strong> 020-7915 4000 </p> <p><strong> Ski 47</strong> three stores in London 020-7384 1979 </p> <p><strong> Blacks</strong> nationwide and mail order 0191 518 2002 </p> <p><strong> Ellis Brigham </strong> nationwide and mail order 0161-834 5555, <a href=\"http://www.ellis-brigham.com\">www.ellis-brigham.com</a> </p> <p><strong> Trekkitt Mountain Sports </strong> 01600 715777</p>",
  "There's a favourite picture editor's trick late in the administration of a politician. A photo taken on the eve of election is laid alongside a leadership snap from that week. In almost all cases, the man (as it generally has been) looks in the later image a 24-hour job for his doctor, nutritionist and trichologist. Jimmy Carter - whose ageing seemed to accelerate by a factor of five while in the White House - is typically regarded as the canvas-in-the-attic in these matters, but Tony Blair, merely three years a leader, is a close second in decline. He seems to wear more make-up than Joan Collins. <p>This week's Egyptian summit may count for little in the history of Middle Eastern conflict but the official going-home photo should be printed large in the chronicles of politics. Buffering Arafat and Barak, allowing them an excuse not to shake hands, President Clinton - fit, handsome, an improbable early 50s - reminded us that he is the only modern leader to look physically better at the end of of his term of office than the beginning. </p> <p>Republican voters and commentators will see this tricking of the calendar merely as proof of the radio talk-show rumour that, at a Little Rock motel on the eve of the 1992 election, the then Governor Clinton gave a signature in blood on a document to a resident who led other guests to complain about the smell of sulphur and whose cloven-feet were noted by children playing in the pool. Clinton-haters will also point to a recent scientific report that regular sex encourages a youthful appearance, while noting that Hillary is looking old. </p> <p>From a calmer perspective - and three weeks before the election of Clinton's successor - the summit picture invites us to reflect on whether presidential authority is largely the gloss of the job, available to anyone who occupies it, or if Bill Clinton has visual and symbolic skills which we are about to discover are irreplaceable. </p> <p> Certainly it was almost impossible to imagine either Al Gore or George W Bush summoning warring nations to a summit. Clinton's intervention may have been mainly symbolic but the frightening thing is that his designated heirs, stiff and dull in the three TV debates, can't even do the symbolism. </p> <p>It's also worth remembering that a key rightwing argument for Clinton's impeachment in the Monica business was that he would have no moral authority in the world. And yet, in Belfast and now Jerusalem, Clinton has been the only one able to bring the frothing tongues of the conflict within spitting distance of each other. Some of this follows from the financial and geographical weight of the nation he leads, but his personal charisma and intelligence are also important, and we should reflect that we have only 12 weeks of them left. </p> <p>Clinton's strength is that, while he may have lied about many things, he genuinely is a poor Southern boy whose political personality was developed by the observation of poverty and racism. In contrast, Gore and Bush are both children of the East Coast elite who happen to have Southern accents. Clinton never met his father; Al and Dubya's were a senator and a president respectively. You can see why Clinton might connect better with the people. The American right would tell you Clinton should be the easiest presidential act to follow. In reality, he's among the toughest. </p> <p>In this week of a Middle East summit and a presidential debate on television, we have come to understand what the historians' bottom line on Clinton will be: a sexual idiot but a political genius. More even than Ronald Reagan, he has reinvented presidential campaigning and the theatre of leadership. Clinton has defined how a president should look and sound: tall, broad, touchy-feely, with a voice of soft anger for the reception of the flag-draped bodies of the dead and a personal psychology of operatic complexity which keeps enthralled an electorate raised on the television sob-shows. </p> <p>But he has also - again like Reagan - reinvented sincerity. Hollywood, Reagan's cradle, spawned the saying that, once you can fake sincerity, you can achieve anything. And this is the most infuriating thing for the politicians who must follow Clinton. A leader whose integrity and authority have been impugned more than any other still somehow radiates power and sincerity. Blair, Gore and Bush might all be better than Clinton at getting into heaven but none of them can touch him when it comes to getting into the hearts of the electorate. </p> <p>Pundits of the right have expressed revulsion at polls showing that, if the two-term limit were lifted, President Clinton would win four more years in the White House. But, looking at what will follow him, this seems a common-sense judgment by the electorate. If politics is theatre - as it increasingly is - you want an Olivier for it, not some bit-part mummer. </p> <p>Nixon was a shifty man who looked shifty; Clinton is a shifty man who looks fine. It's a difficult trick - as they say on television, don't try this yourself at home - but its successful execution makes him the most enthralling politician of our times. And so it is that a politician who can be seen objectively to have disgraced his office will cast a long and belittling shadow over those who try to occupy it. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "A party of Chinese illegal migrants has been saved from likely death after being found by Hong Kong customs officers squeezed into a shipping container bound for California. <p>The 26 stowaways from Fujian province, all men under the age of 25, were found early on Thursday at Hong Kong's Kwai Chung terminal in a cramped 12-metre hard-top container. Eight air vents had been cut into the container floor and covered by planks that could be lifted from inside with ropes. </p> <p>The base of the container was set several centimetres above its edges, in theory allowing some air to penetrate. </p> <p>The \"snakehead\" gang which organised the consignment would have been hoping that the vents would allow sufficient air to keep its human cargo alive on the 12-day voyage across the Pacific. Snakehead gangs specialise in trafficking illegal immigrants using extensive smuggling networks. </p> <p>Police officers said conditions inside the container were already squalid and that the ventilation hatches would have been ineffective. </p> <p>\"It is more than likely,\" a Hong Kong detective said yesterday, \"that... some of them or all of them would not have survived the journey.\" </p> <p>The incident shows that migrants from the Chinese south coast are still willing to entrust their lives to the snakeheads in spite of the death of 58 Chinese in June in a container discovered at Dover. </p> <p>Chinese authorities in Fujian, the traditional source of migration abroad for more than a hundred years, said the snakeheads had spread a new rumour to overcome the unfavourable publicity that \"after the US election, the new president is going to declare an amnesty for illegal migrants\". </p> <p>Fujian residents interviewed yesterday told HK television that many still hoped to emigrate. One young man said that it was \"a choice between money and death\". </p> <p>The migrants caught in Hong Kong say they and their families had promised to pay the smugglers \u00a334,700 per person. They hoped to repay the money by instalments from their wages in the US. </p> <p>The price has risen by 20% because the Fujian authorities are offering a bounty for information. In the past they have been accused of turning a blind eye to the traffic. </p> <p>Hong Kong customs discovered the migrants by inserting a carbon dioxide detector in the crack between the container's doors. The gadget registers above-normal levels of carbon dioxide, indicating that there is live cargo breathing inside. </p> <p>The men were found squatting among crates of provisions. These included about 300 bottles of water and boxes of instant noodles, tinned meat and biscuits. </p> <p>Sanitary needs were provided for by seven plastic buckets and a hundred rolls of lavatory paper. </p> <p>Customs officers believe that the men had only been in the container for a few hours. Some may have entered Hong Kong with \"legitimate\" papers bought in Fujian. </p> <p>Nearly 34,000 containers have been checked in Hong Kong since the beginning of the year, yet this only represents one in every 200 containers sent abroad from the territory.</p>",
  "An unusual thing happened yesterday on the road to the White House. Bill Clinton and Al Gore appeared in public together for the first time in more than two months. <p>The joint appearance, their first since August 15, came at the funeral in Jefferson City of the Missouri governor, Mel Carnahan, a leading moderate Democrat who died in a plane crash on Monday. </p> <p>It came as the two leaders struggled to play down persistent reports of a rift over the role Mr Clinton should play in the Democratic effort to prevent George W Bush from capturing the White House for the Republicans next month. </p> <p>Mr Gore spent the earlier part of the day trying to head off claims that Mr Clinton and his supporters were in almost open revolt against the president's lack of a prominent role in the campaign. Interviewed in New York, Mr Gore said: \"President Clinton is my friend. He is helping out, and I welcome him.\" </p> <p>Yet the fact remains that Mr Clinton has not appeared at any of Mr Gore's campaign events since a symbolic \"passing the torch\" rally in Michigan midway through the Democratic convention. Nor are there any plans for him to do so. And Mr Gore went through three televised debates with Mr Bush this month without once mentioning Mr Clinton by name in a total of four-and-a-half hours of talking. </p> <p>\"He is the president and has a full-time job. That's not just a throwaway phrase,\" Mr Gore said yesterday. \"We've accomplished some good things on behalf of the American people. But I'm running as who I am and on the basis of what we need to do from here on out. I'm not trying to make this race about the past. It really is about the future.\" </p> <p>With Mr Bush inching gradually ahead in some opinion polls, Mr Clinton is desperate to get out on the campaign trail to defend his eight years in office and to ensure Mr Gore's succession. Many anxious Democrats want the highly popular president out there too. But Mr Gore has made it clear that he is determined to keep Mr Clinton at a distance. </p> <p>Mr Clinton was widely reported yesterday to be hurt and mystified that Mr Gore was so obviously giving his boss the cold shoulder. As a compulsive campaigner with an outstanding record of electoral success, Mr Clinton is itching to play a bigger role. </p> <p>Appearing at a party meeting on Capitol Hill on Thursday, Mr Clinton departed from his planned remarks on education. Instead he ripped into Mr Bush's claims that the Democrats had wasted eight years in the White House. </p> <p>Mr Clinton is said to have privately criticised two of Mr Gore's advisers, Carter Eskew and Bob Shrum, for the way they coached Mr Gore for this month's debates, in which Mr Bush regained the initiative. </p> <p>The White House has confirmed that Mr Clinton will hit the campaign trail soon. But Mr Gore and his advisers remain adamant that the president must not be seen to be edging into Mr Gore's campaign, partly for fear of scaring away voters for whom the Monica Lewinsky affair remains the main memory of the Clinton years. </p> <p>\"I'm pleased the president is getting back into the race,\" Mr Bush told an interviewer yesterday. \"For a man with so much on his plate to be worried about me indicates I must be doing pretty darn well in the polls.\" </p> <p>Eight years ago, when Mr Clinton and Mr Gore set out to overthrow Mr Bush's father, the political and generational closeness between the two southerners led reporters to dub their campaign \"Bill and Al's Excellent Adventure\". </p> <p>Today, though, relations between Mr Clinton and Mr Gore are cautious, remote and even increasingly fractious.</p>"
