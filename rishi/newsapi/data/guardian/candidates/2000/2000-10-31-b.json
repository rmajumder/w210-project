  "<p>Almost one in 10 further education colleges are flouting government regulations by not having elected student governors on their governing boards, a survey by student leaders has revealed. </p> <p>The National Union of Students is mounting a naming and shaming campaign against colleges still falling foul of government rules that came into force in August 1999 as part of efforts to clean up the reputation of college managers. The union is now calling for at least two student representatives to be appointed to boards in the future. </p> <p>The results of the survey come to light ahead of a national NUS conference this week preparing student governors for the government reforms being ushered in for colleges next April. </p> <p>The governing boards of colleges face a steep learning curve over the coming year. There are new funding arrangements under the National Learning and Skills Council and its 47 local councils, and a more intrusive inspection regime to be overseen by the Office for Standards in Education. There is also a new, broader A-level curriculum for sixth-formers introduced by the government this academic year. </p> <p>Yet the survey has revealed that, as colleges gear up for the reforms, many are still failing to meet basic requirements for their governing boards to include elected students as members. </p> <p>Preliminary findings from five regions of the national survey (covering East Anglia, East Midlands, London, North-east and North-west) show that 14 of the 152 colleges have no elected student governors. </p> <p>\"We want the Department for Education and Employment to use their powers to clamp down on the colleges, which year after year fail to comply to the mandatory requirements that students should sit on governing boards,\" said Mark Atkinson, NUS vice president further education union development. </p> <p>Those named by the NUS include Hull, Middlesbrough, Darlington and South East Essex colleges. When asked, some colleges said they did have students on their governing boards. But the NUS says these are unelected and therefore illegitimate appointments. </p> <p>Other colleges said that they were in the process of electing student governors, but were unsure of how they would do this or by when. One college told the NUS that an election would not be held until January, which the union believes is far too late in the academic year for the student to become an effective governor. </p> <p>The move to tighten up the regulations for governing bodies came after a series of highly publicised financial scandals which hit the college sector. A number of government inspection reports revealed serious financial mismanagement in colleges around the country. In one case, a weak governing board was blamed for leaving unchecked the shady activities of a powerful and unscrupulous principal. </p> <p>At the NUS student governor convention this week, Stephen Grix, Ofsted's chief inspector for 16-19 education, will introduce governors to the new inspection arrangements. Inspectors in future will visit colleges, rather than validating self-assessment by the colleges themselves. </p> <p>Atkinson says that another problem inspectors are likely to encounter is that students are often excluded from discussions on governing boards. </p> <p>The NUS student governor convention is being held on 3-5 November at the Conference and Training Centre, Yarnfield Park, Stone, Staffordshire. </p>",
  "Texas is the second most populous state of the Union. It accounts for 32 votes in the presidential electoral college, more than any other state except California (54) and New York (33). It should therefore be the arena for fierce campaigning - were it not for the unassailable fact that the battle is already over. It has been won by Governor George W. Bush, the state's favourite son. <p>The tone of the state press is captured in the ringing endorsement of the <a href=\"http://www.reporternews.com/\" target=\"_new\">Abilene Reporter-News</a> \"George W. Bush has a practical, principled view that the federal government's role in American life should be restrained. He wants Washington to help raise up the poorest among us and to solve such problems as guaranteeing the future of social security. But through the device of tax cuts, he also wants to further liberate the American people and to make government less like a shadow that follows everyone everywhere.\" </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://amarillonet.com/\" target=\"_new\">Amarillo Globe-News</a> picks up the theme: \"The plan of GOP candidate George W. Bush is based on individual choice, while the plan of Democratic candidate Al Gore is based on reducing a debt assumed by the federal government and offers little in terms of true reform ... Digging deeper into the plans of each candidate, it is apparent Bush's plan of individual choice offers taxpayers more options, rather than adding to the responsibility of the federal government, which is one of the primary reasons the social security fund got in this mess in the first place.\" </p> <p>One of the few dents in this towering wall of support for Bush, appears in the <a href=\"http://austin360.com/\" target=\"_new\">Austin American-Statesman</a>, which reports an exhaustive, though not necessarily scientific, poll putting Al Gore ahead by 53% to 35%. </p> <p>Much more representative is the <a href=\"http://www.dallasnews.com/\" target=\"_new\">Dallas Morning News</a>, which heartily endorses Bush, and the Republican runner for the Senate. For the House of Representatives, it endorses five Republicans and three Democrats. Of Bush, the paper says: \"The moment that usually draws the greatest applause in Governor Bush's campaign speeches comes when the Republican nominee talks about bringing dignity and character back to the White House. The vigorous response reveals just how deeply some Americans thirst for a new leader. After eight years of White House investigations, fund-raising excesses and a sordid presidential sex scandal, many voters are simply worn down. Even if they enjoy this era's economic expansion, they want honor restored to the White House.\" </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.mysanantonio.com/\" target=\"_new\">San Antonio Express-News</a>features a survey suggesting that Governor Bush is backed by 55.9% of local voters, with 23.7% supporting Al Gore, and 17% still undecided. The big issue in the area, apart from the presidency, is a proposition to add fluoride to the city's water supply. Opinion now heavily favours it. </p> <p>The <a href=\" http://www.chron.com/\" target=\"_new\">Houston Chronicle</a> takes both major parties to task for the latest budgetary wrangle between President Clinton and the Republican-controlled Congress: \"The real irony of it all may be that much of the political gamesmanship is being played out to have an influence on which party wins control of the Congress and which party's presidential nominee wins the White House in next week's elections, while at the same time, the spending spree that's taking place is jeopardizing the very surpluses upon which many of the campaigns' promises and assumptions are being made.\"</p>",
  "The restaurant opposite our flat, the \"Pizzeria Venezia\" down the road, the petrol station on the corner and the towing firm which dragged my illicitly-parked car away when we first moved in, all have one thing in common. They are run by Arab Americans. <p>In fact, Arab culture is so deeply embedded in Washington it is hardly noticeable any more. The lyrical sound of the language folds into the background noise of a Washington street corner. It is just part of the urban mix.</p> <p>Until now, this anonymity has suited the Arab American population well enough. It grew anxious after every skirmish with Iraq or after any terrorist bombing in the Middle East, braced for guilt by association. </p> <p>This year, however, is different. They have found a new more assertive voice, more or less by accident. It just so happens that in a few of the most keenly contested swing states in this election, Arab Americans are a sizeable minority. In Michigan, for example, which hangs delicately in the balance, Arab American voters represent 4% of the electorate, and they traditionally vote in higher numbers than their neighbours. </p> <p>It is therefore no coincidence that the community has been courted by both sides, although with much greater success by the Republican contender, George W Bush. </p> <p>In what seemed to be a mere aside in the second presidential debate, the Texas governor mentioned what he termed the \"racial profiling\" of Arab Americans by immigration officials, and the controversial use of secret evidence in the trials of suspected terrorists - who in several recent cases have been of Arabic descent.</p> <p>With those few words, Mr Bush may well have won Michigan. Democrat Al Gore is unpopular anyway among Arab Americans for his fulsome speeches in support of Israel, and, of course, by his choice of an Orthodox Jew, Joe Lieberman as his running mate. </p> <p>Arab American leaders insist that Mr Lieberman's religion is not an issue but they have accused him of divided loyalties, putting Israeli interests above strictly American ones, despite his record of sympathy for Arab American concerns. </p> <p>The Arab world viewed Mr Bush's father as one of the most sympathetic presidents in modern US history. So when Bush junior went out of his way to meet community leaders on one of his first campaign trips to Michigan, he was greeted by a receptive audience. </p> <p>Mr Gore had scheduled a similar meeting on one of his recent campaign stops but it had to be cancelled at the last minute because he had to attend an emergency White House session on escalating events in the Middle East.</p> <p>It was hardly surprising then that the Detroit chapter of the Arab American political action committee endorsed Mr Bush a few days ago. The explosion of violence on the streets of the West Bank and Gaza has only served to sharpen suspicions, and the Clinton administration is no longer seen by Arabs as an honest broker. </p> <p>Arab Americans are also an important block vote in Ohio, another traditionally swing state now leaning towards Mr Bush. But whether or not the community's influence is seen as decisive, its emergence as a coherent interest group may yet prove to be one of the more important outcomes of this election. </p> <p>It is still not nearly as well-organised as its Jewish-American rival, but it has undoubtedly appeared on the radar screen of the national campaign machines. Arab Americans have shrugged off their invisibility and are flexing their new-found political muscle. US foreign policy in the Middle East cannot remain immune to their presence.</p> <p><b>Email</b><br> <a href=\"mailto:julian.borger@theguardian.com\">julian.borger@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Related special reports</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/US_election_race/0,2759,376727,00.html\">US election race</a><br> </p> <p><b>Other articles:</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=%28julian+borger%29AND+%28VdkPublicationDate+%3E%3D+01%2DSep%2D1998%29&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=score+Desc&amp;Query=julian+borger&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv=\">More articles by Julian Borger</a></p> <p><b>Useful links </b><br> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/\" target=\"_new\">The Washington Post</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.defenselink.mil/pubs/pentagon/\" target=\"_new\">The Pentagon</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/\" target=\"_new\">The White House</a><a> <br></a><a href=\"http://www.capsteps.com/\" target=\"_new\">Capitol Steps political satire</a><a> <br></a><a href=\"http://AmericanPresident.com/xword.html\" target=\"_new\">Washington crossword</a> <br><a href=\"http://dc.about.com/citiestowns/midlanticus/dc/\" target=\"_new\">Washington DC homepage</a></p>",

  "<p>Supporters of Democrat Al Gore and Green candidate Ralph Nader are taking to the internet to promote a rare example of tactical voting. </p> <p>Greens in key marginal states such as Oregon and Maine are offering to \"trade\" their votes with Mr Gore to defeat Republican George W Bush, in return for Gore supporters in less crucial states agreeing to vote for Mr Nader. </p> <p>The double aim is to help Mr Nader win more than 5% of the vote on Tuesday - thus qualifying the Green party for federal funding in the 2004 contest - while giving Mr Gore the best chance of victory. </p> <p>Slate.com columnist Jamin Raskin promoted the vote-swap idea last week while sites such as nadertrader.org and voteswap2000.com set the trading in motion. </p> <p>\"Think locally: vote nationally,\" says the Nadertrader slogan, adding that few people want the responsibility of ushering in a Bush regime. </p> <p>But can people taking part trust one another? \"We hope the benefits of the system are obvious enough that cheating will be kept to a minimum,\" the Voteswap2000 site says. </p> <p>Meanwhile, some Nader voters on the west coast, where polls stay open for up to three hours after they have closed in the east, are planning \"Hold Your Vote\" drives, in which they would wait until 7.30pm for the eastern exit polls. </p> <p>If the race is close, says Hold Your Vote, then voters in the west must swallow their pride and back Mr Gore.

  "<p>Anyone watching South-east Asia's tumbling markets could be forgiven for believing they are experiencing a case of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Only this time it is the Philippine peso that is leading the currency plunge rather than the Thai baht. </p> <p>As the Philippines economy continued its relentless downward spiral yesterday, the man at the centre of the storm, president Joseph Estrada, refused to resign. Fighting for his political life, he offered to relinquish the country's top economic job to his deputy and chief critic, vice president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. </p> <p>\"I will not resign,\" Estrada said in a televised address to the nation, in response to charges that he took \u00a37.5m in payoffs from illegal gambling. \"I will answer all the charges point by point at the proper time. Let the impeachment process take its due course.\" </p> <p>Last night it was unclear whether Ms Arroyo, who resigned from the cabinet earlier this month, would accept the olive branch and take the chair of the economic co-ordinating council. </p> <p>The president's address to the nation is unlikely to reassure investors, who remember that the last crisis also began with a currency collapse. When the Thai government stopped defending the baht's peg against the dollar in July 1997, it triggered a domino effect of collapsing currencies throughout the region. </p> <p><strong> Shock waves</strong><br> </p> <p>The after shocks from the Asian crisis rumbled through world financial markets for most of the following year. The collapse of the Long Term Capital Management hedge fund, which nearly brought the world financial system to a halt in October 1998, had its origins in events in Asia. By 1999 the worse hit economies had made strong recoveries and the IMF proclaimed the end of the crisis. While growth has recovered, markets and currencies throughout the region have taken another bath this year. </p> <p>This time, regional development analysts are trying to convince anyone who will listen that the turmoil is nothing to worry about. The Asian Development Bank, for instance, in its October Asia Recovery Report, put a remarkably bullish spin on a region where equity market capitalisation in local currency levels has fallen by an average of over 30% since the start of the year. </p> <p>\"The magnitude of net capital outflows is nowhere near as large as it was in 1997 and 1998,\" it says. \"The symptoms are the same, but the causes are quite different,\" said Yoshihiro Iwasaki, the head of ADB's regional economic monitoring unit. </p> <p>In the last crisis, a massive inflow of foreign investment put the weak financial systems of the region under strain. This time, investors have been more wary so there is less foreign money to withdraw. Most countries in the region have abandoned pegging their currencies, forcing companies to hedge against the risk of fluctuations in the exchange rate. </p> <p>The trigger for investor nerves this time has been politics rather than economics. The peso has fallen from less than 44 to the US dollar to 51.3 at yesterday's close, thanks to Mr Estrada's involvement in the gambling scandal. Mr Estrada likes to boast that the Philippines is doing better than its neighbours and has recovered much of its losses since 1997. The reality is that its economy did not have so far to fall and is now barely afloat. </p> <p>Indonesia is not far behind. Its currency, the rupiah, was at 8,500 to the dollar 10 weeks ago. Yesterday it fell from 9,035 to 9,410 before firming slightly to 9,325. The central bank advocates intervention but the president, Abdurrahman Wahid, disagrees. Mr Wahid is embroiled in several financial scandals himself, including giving heavily-indebted cronies billions of pounds in debt bailouts. There is growing anti-western sentiment in Indonesia. Many investors have pulled out. </p> <p><strong>Tight controls</strong><br> </p> <p>Malaysia rejected international assistance in 1997 and imposed capital controls instead. The last of these controls were lifted yesterday and a slew of foreign money left for safer climes immediately. No one is predicting what the next few weeks will hold. </p> <p>Thailand is proving to be the nation with its finger in the dyke. While there is nervousness in Bangkok over December's general election and a clear slowdown in economic reform, the baht appears to be holding its own. Dealers say the crucial level is 44 baht to the US dollar. Experts believe that a drop in that level could create problems in Thailand and elsewhere. It closed yesterday at 43.65 with dealer sentiment becoming increasingly negative. </p> <p>Gerard Lyons, head of treasury research at Standard Chartered, says the causes of unease this time are specific to individual countries, and are therefore less likely to lead to a re-run of the last crisis. But he notes that the lesson to be learnt from 1997, is that contagion quickly spreads. \"You can easily be too complacent.\"</p>",
  "The race for the White House headed to the west coast yesterday as George W Bush and Al Gore fought an unexpectedly fierce battle for California, previously thought to be firmly in the Gore camp. <p>California's 54 electoral college votes are the richest single prize in next week's presidential election. So when last week's polls showed Mr Gore's lead slipping, both candidates rescheduled their plans for the final week. </p> <p>Mr Bush was the first to hit California, arriving yesterday for rallies in Los Angeles and in the agricultural heartland city of Fresno, where he was joined by his former Republican rival Senator John McCain. </p> <p>Mr Gore was not far behind, heading west last night for a campaign swing through Oregon and California today after spending yesterday in the battleground states of Michigan and Wisconsin. </p> <p>Underlining the importance the two sides attach to the country's most populous state, President Clinton will also spend two days on the stump in California later this week, focusing his appeal on ethnic minority voters, and rallying Democrats who might be tempted to vote for the Green candidate, Ralph Nader. </p> <p>When the presidential race began in earnest in September California did expect to be courted so seriously, especially in the final week of the campaign. So confident of victory was Mr Gore that he had not visited the state since speaking at the Democratic convention in Los Angeles in August. </p> <p>Mr Bush had made brief visits, but there were few indications that the Republicans had a realistic chance of winning until last week, when a Los Angeles Times poll showed Mr Gore's lead under threat for the first time. </p> <p>The poll, putting Mr Gore on 48%, Mr Bush on 41%, and Mr Nader on 5%, showed the race too close for Democratic comfort and spurred a new \u00a31m advertising assault from the Republicans. </p> <p>A more recent poll, carried out for the San Francisco Examiner and published yesterday, has better news for Mr Gore. It finds him on 49% to Mr Bush's 39%, with Mr Nader on 5%. </p> <p>With Mr Nader also due back in the state this week, the campaign will not lack for Californian glamour. Mr Gore is scheduled to appear at a rally in Los Angeles with the actress Whoopi Goldberg. </p> <p>Mr Bush and Mr Gore are also both taking the opportunity, while in Los Angeles, of appearing once again on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. The chance to take part in a high-ratings show that will demonstrate their \"human\" side is considered too good to be missed. </p> <p>Mr Nader will be attending a final mass rally in Long Beach on Friday night, but his hold on his supporters in California may be facing a squeeze as the Bush-Gore contest heads towards a photo finish. </p> <p>Greg MacArthur, who has been financing a $320,000 ad campaign for Mr Nader on behalf of Citizens for Strategic Voting, pulled his ads from the Los Angeles Times, San Francisco Examiner and San Francisco Chronicle newspapers last week as fears arose that a Nader vote night lose Mr Gore the state. </p> <p>Mr Bush will be vying with Mr Clinton in making a special pitch to the large Latino vote in California. </p> <p>Spanish language ads for the Republicans have been shown widely in the state and Mr Bush addressed Latino community leaders in the city of Anaheim by satellite on Sunday. </p> <p>\u0095 Two weeks after her husband died in an air crash, the widow of the Missouri governor and Democratic senatorial candidate Mel Carnahan announced yesterday that she would take up his seat if he is posthumously elected on November 7. </p> <p>The late governor's name remained on the ballot after a small plane crashed killing him, his son and an aide.<br><b>Julian Borger, Washington</b></p>",
  "Despite all the complaints about the difficulty of falling in love with either Al Gore or George W Bush, these two very different men have delivered a clean, well-argued campaign that offers a choice between two sharply contrasting visions of the future. <p>This is the first presidential campaign in recent history centred on an argument over how best to use real resources to address age-old domestic problems while also defining the United States' role in a world evermore dependent on it for farsighted international leadership. </p> <p>Having listened to their debate, we today firmly endorse Al Gore as the man best equipped for the presidency by virtue of his knowledge of government, his experience at the top levels of federal and diplomatic decision-making, and his devotion to the general welfare. </p> <p>We offer this endorsement knowing that Mr Bush is not without his strong points and that Mr Gore has his weaknesses. </p> <p>We commend Mr Bush for running a largely positive, inclusive campaign. He has not played on divisive social themes as his father did in 1988. But on women's rights, guns and law-enforcement issues, he has a harsh agenda, and the centrepiece of his domestic programme is a lavish tax cut for the rich that would negate the next Congress's once-in-a-century opportunity to move the country toward universal health care and stabilisation of social security and Medicare. </p> <p>Preserving the nation's remarkable prosperity must be considered the thematic spine of this election. Mr Gore promises to maintain fiscal rigour while using the surplus on spending programmes and tax breaks for the working families that profited least from the biggest boom in American history. </p> <p>Mr Bush's entire economic programme is built on a stunning combination of social inequity and flawed economic theory. </p> <p>Most citizens know that Mr Gore wins any comparison with Mr Bush on experience and knowledge. Yet many voters seem more comfortable with Mr Bush's personality and are tempted to gamble on him. We do not dismiss this desire for someone who they feel does not talk down to them. </p> <p>But it is important to remember that the nation's prosperity, its environmental progress and its guarantees of civil rights and reproductive freedom took years to build. </p> <p>They could be undone in a flash by a pliable and inexperienced president driven by a highly ideological Congress.</p>",
  "Does America need continuity for the next four years, or does it need to change the tone and direction of our nation's course? <p>We believe a fundamental shift is needed. True, the last eight years have brought unrivalled peace and prosperity. Yet this period in our national life also has led to the diminution of respect for the office of the presidency, a greater incivility on Capitol Hill and an exhausted New Democrat agenda. </p> <p>A clear turning point has arrived. We strongly believe Texas governor George W Bush should become the nation's first president of a new century. We base our decision upon three crucial points. </p> <p>The potential to redeem Washington's culture - immediately upon becoming Texas's governor in 1995, George Bush reached his hand across the aisle and drew in Democrats to work with him to improve schools, overhaul welfare and develop businesses. </p> <p>Since 1995, many Republicans and Democrats have maintained a governing coalition that has placed the nation's second most populous state on a centre-right path that emphasises improved schools, fiscal restraint and social tolerance. </p> <p>No voter should assume that hoisting Austin's model of government upon Washington's weary landscape will be simple. But Governor Bush has the tools to construct a different political architecture. </p> <p>The ability to restore honour and integrity to the White House - The moment that usually draws the greatest applause in Mr Bush's campaign speeches comes when the Republican nominee talks about bringing dignity and character back to the White House. Even if they enjoy this era's economic expansion, they want honour restored to the White House. So do we. George Bush could do that by providing a clean, clear break from the past. </p> <p>The opportunity to usher in a progressive-conservative era - Governor Bush started his presidential campaign in June 1999 promoting the promise of \"compassionate conservatism\". The modern presidency may compete with Wall Street, Silicon Valley, state capitals and even Hollywood to shape American society. But the nation still needs a president who can build bipartisan relationships, restore honour to the White House and promote a responsible agenda. </p> <p>George W Bush could bring change on each of these fronts. We embrace his call for reform and strongly believe Americans should vote for change over continuity in November.</p>",
  "The moderate ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova claimed victory over his main rivals yesterday in Kosovo's first free elections, opening up hope of a future dialogue with the estranged Serb minority. <p>The preliminary results are likely to be announced later today, but a spokesman for the vote organisers did not dispute Mr Rugova's claim that his Democratic Party of Kosovo (LDK) had won most of the 30 municipalities in the province. </p> <p>Hashim Thaci, head of the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK), said he would respect the outcome. </p> <p>\"We will recognise the final result,\" he told a news conference, adding that the PDK would assist in the work of the elected town councils. \"Objectively, we did not expect such a result.\" </p> <p>Mr Rugova, head of the oldest, most mainstream Kosovo Albanian party, said he was dedicated to cooperation across party and ethnic lines in shaping Kosovo's future. </p> <p>\"The LDK cultivates tolerance and cooperation with other political groups,\" he said. \"We will continue protection of minorities, which should be integrated into Kosovo institutions. But it is important to remember that this election had both a local and national context - which is independence for Kosovo.\" </p> <p>If the LDK's victory is confirmed, it will mark Mr Rugova's return from the political wilderness after the passive resistance drive he led against the Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic for 10 years was eclipsed by the guerrilla uprising. The rebels broke Belgrade's grip and emerged as folk heroes after the Serbian security forces, under aerial attack by Nato, halted its mass expulsions of ethnic Albanians and left Kosovo. Nato peacekeepers and UN administrators arrived in the middle of last year. </p> <p>\"This was a vote for moderation, so it's welcome,\" said Louis Sell, director of the Kosovo office of the International Crisis Group. </p> <p>\"Although Rugova has never swerved from independence as his goal, he is more inclined to achieve his objectives peacefully, through negotiation. The Serbs previously made clear they'd prefer Rugova to the ex-guerrillas.\" </p> <p>In Belgrade, a senior member of the new Yugoslav president Vojislav Kostunica's reformist cabinet welcomed Mr Rugova's revival. </p> <p>\"We can say it is positive that ethnic Albanian citizens from Kosovo have opted for a more moderate, more democratic, more liberal option and not for an option which is defined by separatism and terrorism,\" Vladan Batic said. </p> <p>Kosovo's 75,000-odd Serbs refused to vote in protest at post-war Albanian reprisals. Mr Kostunica's cabinet has supported their protest, and on Sunday it released a statement saying the elections were invalid because the Serb minority had not taken part. </p> <p>But Mr Kostunica has also said he will seek to cooperate with the UN, whose officials plan to appoint Serbs to municipal councils and allow by-elections later to redress the imbalance.
