  "George W Bush changed his tack and his tone in the US presidential election campaign yesterday, seeking to revive his flagging fortunes with an issues-based drive for middle-class votes in the battleground states. <p>The Republican candidate began a 12-city tour with a visit to an Arkansas maternity ward, where he waxed lyrical on the joys of fatherhood at the start of a week in which he aims to highlight his \"cradle-to-grave\" domestic policy agenda and ditch his reputation for negative campaigning.</p> <p>It was the start of \"an important week in this campaign\", he admitted in a speech in Little Rock, \"a week that speaks to the aspirations and hopes of middle-class families all across the nation.\"</p> <p>The visit to the maternity ward kicked off a determined effort by the Republicans to regain control of the election agenda from Vice-President Al Gore, the Democratic candidate, who continues to extend his recent lead in the opinion polls, not just nationally but in many of the states that will decide the election.</p> <p>\"This is a very focused, more aggressive effort to let voters know where Governor Bush stands on the major issues of the day,\" his spokesman, Ari Fleischer, told reporters before the start of the latest campaign swing. </p> <p>Each day of the week would feature \"metaphor\" visits to enable Mr Bush to set out his stall on issues such as education, welfare, taxes and pensions, Mr Fleischer said.</p> <p>Mr Bush will end the week with another visit to Florida, where he will talk about his plans for the elderly. The visit to the state where his brother Jeb is governor, and which most strategists originally put in the Republican camp, shows how strongly Mr Gore is doing in the battleground states.</p> <p>With some polls showing Mr Gore threatening to take a dominant lead, Mr Bush launched a \"Blueprint for the Middle Class\", a 16-page summary of his policy proposals, and began highlighting his new slogan: \"Real Plans for Real People.\"</p> <p>\"It's a real plan. It isn't one of those things with a lot of fine print in it. It's a real plan to help families help themselves,\" he said before going on to Missouri and Illinois.</p> <p>The move is a calculated risk, since the polls that show Mr Gore leading also show him well ahead on most of the issues the Republicans want to highlight. But Mr Bush has come under fierce pressure from within his party to focus on themes that the voters repeatedly say matter most to them.</p> <p>The most recent polls differ about the extent of Mr Gore's lead, but there is no disagreement about the fact that, after months of seeming to be on course for victory, Mr Bush is struggling to prevent the vice-president succeeding Bill Clinton on November 7.</p> <p>The latest Newsweek poll shows Mr Gore with a 50% to 38% lead among registered voters, and a 52% to 38% advantage among likely voters - the biggest leads he has had in any national poll since the candidates began their campaigns for the White House more than two years ago.</p> <p>Other polls show Mr Gore with only a single-figure lead, but all demonstrate that he is widening the gap. A new Harris Interactive survey gives Mr Gore a 46% to 43% lead, while the latest Gallup three-day tracking poll shows him at 49%, against Mr Bush's 41%.

  "Yugoslavia began trying western leaders yesterday for their part in the Nato bombing of Yugoslavia last year, accusing them of crimes against humanity and violating the country's territorial sovereignty. <p>The trial is expected to end immediately before Sunday's presidential and general elections with sentences of 15-20 years on Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, the former Nato secretary general Xavier Solana and European commander General Wesley Clarke, among others. </p> <p>As President Slobodan Milosevic's re-election campaign gathered pace before polling day, his anti-Nato rhetoric found an echo in the trial. </p> <p>A row of 14 empty chairs was set opposite the panel of judges in Belgrade's palace of justice, each seat labelled with the name of the person charged in absentia. </p> <p>It took three hours to read the charges accusing them of crimes against humanity, initiating an aggressive war, using illegal weapons such as cluster bombs, and violating the territorial sovereignty of Yugoslavia. </p> <p>The prosecutor read out the names of 503 civilians, 240 soldiers and 147 police officers whom he said were killed during the bombing. </p> <p>At the weekend three members of the student-based resistance movement Otpor, were jailed for 10 days for spraying graffiti on walls in the capital. </p> <p>Their lawyer, Biljana Kajganic, said the trial in the Belgrade police headquarters in was \"incorrect\" and she would appeal against the verdict. </p> <p>The latest poll shows Mr Milosevic with 27% and Mr Kostunica with 32% of the vote. But 30% of the electorate have not yet decided or say they will not vote. </p> <p>In a further sign of jitters, the state newspaper Politika carried a vitriolic attack on the presidential opposition chal lenger Vojislav Kostunica. One analyst in Belgrade said he believed the article, which portrays Mr Kostunica as a serial adulterer and a liar, could sway many voters. </p> <p>The Nato show trial was dismissed by a western diplomat as \"a pre-election stunt\". But it plays to a campaign by the Milosevic regime which has exploited the incomprehension and anger felt by many people toward Nato and the west. </p> <p>State newspapers and television carried long items from the trial and are expected to report vivid testimony and show gruesome pictures of the damage inflicted on civilians. </p> <p>One of the crimes against civilians with which the western leaders are charged is the bombing of the state television station RTS. </p> <p>Testimonies were read, including that of a desk editor who spoke of the smell in the building. \"I found two men who were completely bloody,\" he said. \"The smell and the smoke was pervasive. I had blood dripping from my legs.\" </p> <p>The evidence was accompanied by footage of burned bod ies under collapsed masonry. </p> <p>The public reaction to the trial will become clear in the coming days. </p> <p>Zanka Stojanovic, who lost her 26-year-old son Nebojsa in the RTS attack, said she blamed Nato and Mr Milosevic. \"We are accusing Nato leaders and domestic politicians as the ones who are responsible for this,\" she said. \"Our people were not good diplomats and to let such a terrible thing happen at the end of the 20th century is a shame for human kind.\" </p> <p>But she took no comfort from the trial: \"It is a circus theatre. Those people who are behaving as judges and lawyers, those people are clowns, because if they are judging those people who are not here, then they can judge those people who are here.\"</p>",
  "Soldiers in a US army unit whose motto was \"shoot 'em in the face\" beat and abused civilians in Kosovo, according to an official army report prepared published yesterday. <p>It found that the soldiers had violated the basic standards of decency and humanity because they had not been prepared properly for a peacekeeping role in the area. </p> <p>The report comes in the wake of the conviction last month of Staff Sergeant Frank Ronghi for rape and murder. Ronghi has been sentenced to life for killing a young girl while he was on peacekeeping duty in Kosovo, and the case has severely damaged the reputation of the US troops in the area. </p> <p>The army released the 1,100-page report into the behaviour of A company, 3rd battalion, 504th parachute infantry regiment yesterday. </p> <p>The army said all the main conclusions and findings of the investigation by Colonel John Morgan were being made public. A limited number of details were being withheld for reasons of security or privacy. </p> <p>The report amounts to a devastating indictment not only of the way in which members of the unit behaved in Kosovo but also of the way in which they were prepared for their assignment. </p> <p>\"Unit members violated the limits and terms of their military assignments by interrogating, abusing and beating Albanians,\" the report concluded. It suggested that the unit's members had \"violated basic standards\" of what was expected of soldiers in the US forces. </p> <p>It concluded that the commanders of the unit should have been aware of what was being done by their troops. The failure of the senior officers to put a brake on the activities of their men meant that they effectively \"perpetuated a volatile situation\". </p> <p>At the root of the problem, the report found, was the way in which the men were prepared for their assignment before they left the US in July last year. Many of the men interviewed during the investigation said they had been prepared as though they were about to enter a high-intensity combat zone rather than a peacekeeping role which depended on winning the confidence of a civilian population. </p> <p>As a result, the report said, the men \"experienced difficulties tempering their combat mentality for adapting and transitioning to peacekeeping duties\". </p> <p>The unit's slogan, \"shoot 'em in the face\", was an indication of the attitude the soldiers took with them on their duties. The soldiers were found to lack the necessary skills for intelligence-gathering and interrogating civilians about the situation, one of the key roles of a peacekeeping force. </p> <p>Nine other men were disciplined and received administrative punishment after Ronghi's arrest. </p> <p>The report, which is highly critical of the command structure and training of the unit, could be used as ammunition in the presidential campaign. The Republican candidate, George W Bush, has criticised the Clinton administration, and by implication his rival Al Gore, for supposedly running down the military and allowing it to become demoralised and underfunded. </p> <p>A report that backs up such accusations could be used in the debate on which party is better equipped to handle the armed forces.</p>",
  "<p>Plans to restore student grants will be back on the political agenda after the next election, university leaders are convinced. The vice-chancellors' decision to include maintenance grants as an option in the funding reform package they are drawing up reflects a growing belief that the main barrier to Labour's goal of bringing more children from \"the wrong side of the tracks\" into higher education is not fees but living costs for poor students. </p> <p>Next year some 400,000 students in England and Wales will not pay fees as the government raises the threshold at which parents contribute from \u00a317,370 to \u00a320,000. Upfront fees for Scottish students were abolished after the Cubie report in favour of graduate contributions. Yet many universities seem to find it harder to meet their targets with places going begging. </p> <p>Since abolishing grants in 1997 the government has introduced a patchwork of measures to help students, including 6,000 Opportunity Bursaries worth \u00a32,000 to students over a three-year course - grants in all but name. </p> <p>Last week's announcement of extra funding for universities made by Baroness Blackstone, the education minister, to the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals' annual conference at Stockton, was welcomed - for first time since 1986 funding per student has risen instead of being cut. But university heads are still convinced their funding needs radical reform to put them on a firmer footing. As Sir Howard Newby, the committee's president, commented: \"No one can discern whether it is a genuine turning of the tide or a blip in a downward spiral.\" </p> <p> The vice-chancellors are working towards a major review of higher education funding in the next parliament, trying to reach agreement among themselves before selling the idea to politicians, especially David Blunkett's successor as education secretary. Five options for consideration were set out in a report from Sir William Taylor, former head of Hull, Huddersfield and Thames Valley universities - building on existing funding policies; increased tuition fees paid upfront; deferred payment for tuition through a graduate contribution; full-cost fees charged by universities with students taking loans to pay; and full privatisation (the least likely option, rejected even by well-endowed Cambridge). </p> <p>But, crucially, the Stockton meeting decided to include Lord Dearing's original recommendations to the government in 1997 - to retain grants for students from poor backgrounds and charge every student tuition fees for which they would take out loans repayable after graduation. Blunkett, who disliked the idea of fees in principle, decided to make them means-tested so that a third - soon 50% - of students would not pay fees. However, he conceded to the Treasury that maintenance grants would have to go. </p> <p>The vice-chancellors also agreed that the Cubie report's proposals for Scotland - which included maintenance grants - should be included in their options. Sir Martin Harris, vice-chancellor of Manchester University, said the main problem in widening participation in higher education was not fees but the loss of grants. </p> <p>Ministers are insisting there will be no change of policy - Blackstone repeated this assurance in Stockton - although Blunkett has called for a debate. Some vice-chancellors expect changes to be evolutionary rather than drastic but the message for parents must be: \"Start saving - the cost of a university education will rise for the majority.\" </p> <p>Universities have drawn up a \"concordat\" with school and college heads to work at widening participation. </p> <p>After the Laura Spence affair - refused a place at Oxford and given a scholarship to Harvard - the government is ploughing \u00a333m into access schemes such as summer schools and outreach programmes to encourage underprivileged families to enter higher education. Part of the money will be shared between all universities and higher education colleges but part will be reserved for \"high demand\" institutions like Oxford, angering many new universities which have a good track record in giving chances to students from working class and ethnic minority backgrounds. </p> <p>\"It's a bit galling,\" admitted one vice-chancellor.</p>"
