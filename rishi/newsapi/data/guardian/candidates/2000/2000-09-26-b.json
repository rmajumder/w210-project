  "If ever mathematical proof was needed of Oprah Winfrey's importance to the nation, it was on obvious display this week. George W Bush jumped in the space of a few days from a 10-point deficit in the opinion polls to a 1% lead, and the only thing anyone could remember him doing was kissing the country's favourite chat-show hostess. <p>That may be a slight over-simplification. He appeared on another talkshow wearing a dark shirt which matched the one being worn by the host, Regis Philbin. People thought that was fun too, but they really liked the kiss. It seemed to have the same sort of tonic effect on Bush's political standing as Vice-President Al Gore's prolonged on-stage snog with his wife Tipper, at last month's party convention. </p> <p>If anyone still doubted that the Oprah effect was truly in play in these elections, they only had to check out the breakdown of the polling figures. The greatest leap in Bush's support was among women, who make up the overwhelming majority of Oprah and Regis audiences, and who have proved to be an elusive electorate for republicans in general. </p> <p>The television analysts said Bush won his poll surge just by looking relaxed and leaning forward, looking keen and engaged. But the kiss planted on the talkshow queen's cheek might have been the clincher. When Al Gore appeared on the Oprah show a few days earlier, he had offered his hand rather than his lips, earning a rebuke from his hostess. And the vice-president had sat back in his armchair and thrown his head back when he laughed, looking aloof. </p> <p>The fact that the Oprah effect has thus been demonstrated under near-laboratory conditions (not much else was going on that might have spoiled the experiment) is likely to have a significant effect on future campaigns. The Oprah show, with its 7m viewers, is likely to become as important a stop along the way to the presidency as the presidential debates. There are likely to be Oprah trainers hired alongside the debate coaches, and they will specialise in body language - how to sit and how to kiss. </p> <p>They will also teach the delicate art of confession, which has become an almost ritual need for a society steeped in the protocols of the talkshow and the soap opera. The confession must be offered at some apparent personal cost. It must draw a tear or at least a glassy eye. </p> <p>Bush scored here. His eyes turned shiny after talking about his wife's difficult pregnancy, and stayed shiny through the ensuing commercial break. Gore, by remaining dry-eyed while talking about Tipper's struggle with depression, thus failed to fulfil the audience's expectations and we must conclude he suffered at the polls as a consequence. </p> <p>But a confession is a double-edged dagger. A candidate will not wish to imply a lasting weakness. The fault he confesses must be something which he or she has overcome and which has only served to make him or her stronger. In Hollywood it is known as the narrative \"arc\". It is built into most of the characters in film or television dramas because it provides a satisfying mix of challenge and redemption. </p> <p>Now, the electorate is expecting the same biographical curvature from the country's presidents as well. Bush scored particularly well here. He tells the well-used story of how he broke his long and deep relationship with alcohol the day after his 40th birthday in the wake of a raucous night out with friends - just about that time he found God. </p> <p>Gore suffers because he lacks this sort of an arc. His progression from senator's son to congressman to senator to vice-president has been tediously linear. Straight lines do not play well in the movies, and in the Age of Oprah they make for bad politics too. </p>",
  "<p>La campa\u00f1a de las elecciones presidenciales en Estados Unidos tiene acento latino. El candidato republicano George W. Bush habla en castellano para pedir el voto hispano. El candidato dem\u00f3crata, Al Gore, visita las comunidades latinas para acceder a la Casa Blanca. </p> <p>La minor\u00eda hispana en Estados Unidos tiene en sus manos un gran poder de decisi\u00f3n. Son treinta millones de ciudadanos y representan el diez por ciento de la poblaci\u00f3n. Est\u00e1n concentrados en estados clave: California, Texas, Nueva York y Florida. Es imposible ganar las elecciones presidenciales sin ganar en California. Y es imposible ganar en California sin conseguir, al menos, un tercio del voto latino. El voto de la minor\u00eda hispana en Estados Unidos puede decidir entre 25 y 30 esca\u00f1os de la C\u00e1mara de Representantes. </p> <p> <strong> Cree usted que la comunidad hispana en Estados Unidos tiene cada vez m\u00e1s influencia?</strong></p> <p><strong>Mar\u00eda Mart\u00ednez (17 a\u00f1os): </strong> S\u00ed, porque en cinco a\u00f1os ser\u00e1 la mayor\u00eda entre las minor\u00edas. Y su crecimiento demogr\u00e1fico es muy acele- rado. La gente reivindica ahora sus ra\u00edces hispanas. Donde yo vivo, en Washington Heights, casi todos son dominicanos, puertorrique\u00f1os y cubanos. En la calle, en los bancos, \"las aplicaciones\" oficiales est\u00e1n todas en espa\u00f1ol y en ingl\u00e9s. En las cuadras cuelgan sus banderas de sus pa\u00edses y las fiestas que organizan son muy populares. </p> <p> <strong> Robert Stevens (18 a\u00f1os): </strong> S\u00ed, es como una moda, y quiz\u00e1 un poco exagerado. Dicen que en Nueva York uno de cada cinco ciudadanos habla espa\u00f1ol en casa. Hay cadenas de televisi\u00f3n y radio en espa\u00f1ol, y tienen mucha audiencia. </p> <p> <strong> Ingrid Mat\u00edas (19 a\u00f1os): </strong> S\u00ed, es cada vez m\u00e1s influyente. Los artistas latinos ayudan a dar a conocer que existe una comunidad latina y que est\u00e1 aqu\u00ed para quedarse. Y muchos j\u00f3venes trabajamos para mejorar el nivel de educaci\u00f3n de la comunidad hispana y de otras minor\u00edas, como la afroamericana. </p> <p> <strong> A qu\u00e9 candidato a presidente votar\u00eda usted? Por qu\u00e9? Qu\u00e9 le pedir\u00eda a favor de la comunidad hispana?</strong></p> <p><strong>Mar\u00eda: </strong> A Al Gore porque promete mejorar el sistema sanitario. No ofrece nada espec\u00edfico para la comunidad hispana pero los pol\u00edticos del partido dem\u00f3crata tienen m\u00e1s contactos con los hispanos y las minor\u00edas. Y yo prefiero que no prometan nada si no van a cumplirlo. Yo pedir\u00eda m\u00e1s ayudas econ\u00f3micas para los barrios latinos. </p> <p> <strong> Robert: </strong> No lo s\u00e9, no soy muy \"aficionado\" a la pol\u00edtica. </p> <p> <strong> Ingrid: </strong> A Al Gore. Pedir\u00eda m\u00e1s ayudas econ\u00f3micas para los j\u00f3venes latinos, para que vayan a la universidad. Al Gore visit\u00f3 hace un a\u00f1o la escuela de Brooklyn donde estoy colaborando, El Puente High School. </p> <p> <strong> En casa, en la escuela, con los amigos, en la calle, en qu\u00e9 idioma habla?</strong> </p> <p><strong>Mar\u00eda: </strong> En espa\u00f1ol y en ingl\u00e9s. Yo nac\u00ed en Estados Unidos y mi madre es de la Rep\u00fablica Dominicana. Tambi\u00e9n hablo spanglish, que es una mezcla de ingl\u00e9s y espa\u00f1ol. Pero procuro no hacerlo porque destruye el castellano. A veces es divertido, pues hay personas que dicen \"vacu nar la carpeta\" en vez de pasar el aspirador por la alfombra, o \"comprar groser\u00edas\" para comprar comestibles, o \"llamar para atr\u00e1s\" para devolver una llamada. </p> <p> <strong> Robert: </strong> En ingl\u00e9s. Tengo algunos amigos hispanos pero hablo con ellos en ingl\u00e9s. Entiendo tambi\u00e9n un poco el espa\u00f1ol.

Y el castellano deber\u00eda ser lengua obligatoria en algunos estados como Nueva York, California, Texas, Florida o Nueva Jersey. La mayor\u00eda de personas en estos estados habla espa\u00f1ol. </p> <p> <strong> Robert: </strong> Muchas personas en Estados Unidos temen que el espa\u00f1ol domine el ingl\u00e9s.

  "Slobodan Milosevic, struggling to retain his grip on the Yugoslav presidency, sought yesterday to force a second round runoff in the face of a deafening chorus of domestic and international calls for him to relinquish power. <p>All unofficial polls - except for those carried out by Mr Milosevic's Socialist party and some of its allies - put him more than 20% behind his main challenger, Vojislav Kostunica, who has managed to unite a fractured opposition. Mr Milosevic, cornered, is now fighting for time. </p> <p>Mr Kostunica, 56, a law professor, claimed victory in Sunday's ballot and demanded that the state election commission release the official count: \"This is a peoples' victory,\" he declared. \"We will defend our victory by peaceful means and we will protest for as long as it takes.\" </p> <p>As the commission delayed the announcement of the results, both sides issued widely conflicting unofficial results. The Democratic Opposition of Serbia claimed that with the votes counted at 60% of polling stations, Mr Kostunica was leading on 55.31%, against to Mr Milosevic's 34.19%. </p> <p>But Gorica Gajevic, the general secretary of Mr Milosevic's Socialist party, said that with 37 % of the ballots counted, the president was ahead, on 45 % to Mr Kostunica's 40%.\"This result gives us optimism that we can win in the first round,\" he added. </p> <p>There was no word from Mr Milosevic himself, and fears persisted that the authorities would resort to violence to retain their grip on power. </p> <p>Western countries piled the pressure on the Yugoslav leader to accept defeat. Germany, Britain, Italy, France and the European Union all declared that Mr Milosevic had lost in Sunday's vote. The US said it doubted Mr Milosevic could make any \"credible claim of victory\". </p> <p>Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, said: \"Today Milosevic is a beaten, broken-backed president. My message to him today is, be honest with your people. Get out of the way and let Serbia get out of the prison you have turned it into.\" </p> <p>The fightback began yesterday afternoon at a press conference for domestic consumption, in which Mr Gajevic insisted that Mr Milosevic had taken the first round of the election but that the margin was small, so he would fight a second round in a fortnight to give him absolute victory. </p> <p>But even former Milosevic allies such as the ultranationalist Radical party agree that he has lost. Analysts said Mr Milosevic's camp was divided between those advising him to declare an outright victory and those saying he should play for time. Even a runoff would represent a loss of face. </p> <p>Milos Aligridoc, a member of the opposition said yesterday: \"[A runoff] would mean absolute humiliation for him and he is not a man who likes to be humiliated .\" </p> <p>Belgrade was calm yesterday but pressure is beginning to mount against the business people involved with the rul ing party, who have long controlled the wealthy shopping streets and the black market in cigarettes, petrol and whisky. </p> <p>The opposition was out on the streets of Belgrade again last night, celebrating victory. Everywhere people are discussing Mr Milosevic's fate. </p> <p>\"I go for the Ceaucescu option myself,\"said one housewife. \"Although, I think he will be killed by someone inside his own circle who wants to become a hero of the Serbian people.\" </p> <p>The state election commission was locked out of its office in the federal parliament building yesterday, as it has been since Sunday night, effectively suspending the official count. Mirko Popovic, a member of the commission, said that technically they could be called in time to announce the official result on Thursday. </p> <p><b> Result according to pro- and anti-Milosevic camps</b> </p> <p>\u0095Main opposition bloc </p> <p>Milosevic 34% </p> <p>Kostunica 55% </p> <p>\u0095Serbian Radical party </p> <p>Milosevic 37.9% </p> <p>Kostunica 53.5% </p> <p>\u0095Socialist party </p> <p>Milosevic 45% </p> <p>Kostunica 40% </p> <p>\u0095Yugoslav Left party </p> <p>Milosevic 56.3% </p> <p>Kostunica 31.4%</p>",
  "The golden hour will come just after 2.15 this afternoon. That's the moment the tens of thousands of delegates, journalists and assorted hangers-on gathered in Brighton are waiting for. Once it's passed, the energy will suck out of the Brighton Centre like air from a birthday balloon. In a party conference, the leader's speech is all. <p>Tony Blair knows that. That's why he will have spent last night doing yet another read-through, and why he will probably wield the editorial pencil a few more times this morning. He will have rehearsed his delivery, trying out the key lines for Alastair Campbell's approval - just as he does in the Rory Bremner send-up. </p> <p>In fact, Campbell and others will have been toiling on this speech for months. On the other side of summer the brainboxes of Downing Street, led by the head of the policy unit, David Miliband, would have been asked for \"input\" on the substance of the address, submitting chunks on education, health, tax. Throughout the process, Gordon Brown and Peter Mandelson, along with Campbell, will have kept a close eye on the core message. All the while, No 10's hired wordsmiths, including Campbell himself, will have been striving to turn those memos and political instructions into ear-friendly prose. </p> <p>Every element is treated with deadly seriousness - including the gags. John O'Farrell, the satirist and Guardian columnist, was drafted in to write Blair's jokes. He, along with the others, will have heard the dreaded word \"rewrite\" a dozen times in the past two weeks - as the team edited the text to take account first of Mo Mowlam's departure, then the Dome debacle, then the fuel crisis and now demands for higher pensions. </p> <p>But why all this trouble over a mere address? Surely Downing Street knows the conventional wisdom is that the political speech is dead? After all, a subtle part of the New Labour revolution was a shift away from the thundering oratory of the party's past - exemplified by the likes of Tony Benn, Michael Foot and Neil Kinnock - and towards the softer, more telegenic style of Tony Blair. Podium-banging and tub-thumping went out with clause four. </p> <p>The evidence for the death of the speech seems persuasive enough. The great barnstormers are either dead or dying, unreplaced by their successors in the Commons or elsewhere. TV is said to have killed off the public meeting, where rhetoric found its most natural home. The new generation of leaders have cultivated a kind of anti-oratory - typified by Charles Kennedy - in which the stirring passage is deliberately replaced by the relaxed, chatty aside which prompts barely a ripple in the hall but plays well on television. As if to illustrate the shift, much of today's news is made far away from the podium. Who remembers the great public speech which ignited the fuel protest movement? There wasn't one. Or think of one of Blair's most memorable phrases: \"I'm a pretty straight kind of guy.\" He said that in a TV interview. </p> <p>Despite all that, the Labour party - both leaders and followers - seem to think that today's speech matters. The funny thing is, they're right. For, regardless of fashion, political speeches can still turn fate around. Not perhaps in the romantic, Shakespearean sense - in which a single oration by a Mark Antony can persuade a nation to change course - but a few words, chosen well or ill, can still reshape the political landscape. </p> <p>The Blairites have a favourite example, one from which they've drawn much comfort in recent days. In the US their fellow apostle of the Third Way, Al Gore, was also languishing in the polls behind a conservative promising lower taxes and a shrunken state. Gore, too, had to do something to haul himself and his party out of the hole. The solution was a speech - his acceptance address at last month's Democratic convention in Los Angeles. Gore won plaudits for his energy, his concentration on substance and his uncharacteristic (if deliberate) non-woodenness, including a semi-pornographic snog with his wife Tipper. The result was a an extraordinary double-digit surge in the ratings. Not that Blair needs too many lessons from America on the enduring power of the speech. Comfy though he may be on the sofas of David Frost and Richard &amp; Judy, Blair knows all too well how a set-piece address can make all the difference. For one thing, he laid the foundations of New Labour with his first leader's speech to the Labour conference in Blackpool in 1994. He told activists then that a modern party needed \"a modern constitution\" - code for the rewriting of clause four, the emblematic battle which defined Blair in opposition. A year later Blair used the leader's speech to trail another dramatic shift, not just for Labour but the entire nation. He presaged both the landslide of 1997 and the Cool Britannia phenomenon when he spoke of his ambition to make Britain \"a young country again.\" </p> <p>Indeed, for all of its famous felicity with the techniques of modern political combat - websites, rapid rebuttal, pagers and the rest - the evolution of the entire New Labour project can be traced through a series of landmark low-tech speeches. Besides Blair's own efforts, John Prescott's 1993 plea for Labour delegates to move to a system of one member, one vote still stands out as a key moment in the birth of the new regime. No matter that it read in print like a corrupted computer file; the spirit was what mattered, not the syntax. The modernisation of New Labour took a stride forward, and Prescott solidified his status as the reformers' indispensable ambassador to the party. </p> <p> Earlier still, the very first step towards the transformation of Labour came in a speech from the conference platform. In 1985 Neil Kinnock stunned a Bournemouth audience by rounding on the Militant-infiltrated local authority in Liverpool. \"You end in the grotesque chaos of a Labour council,\" Kinnock raged, \"a Labour council - hiring taxis to scuttle round a city handing out redundancy notices to its own workers!\" The target of his ire, Derek Hatton, was sitting just a few yards away, leaping to his feet to denounce Kinnock as a \"liar, liar\". The whole scene was played over and over on the TV news. The episode told the nation that Labour wanted to change, that the days of left-wing extremism were coming to an end. David Owen has spoken of Kinnock's Bournemouth turn as the precise moment when he knew his own Social Democratic dream would fail; Labour was clearly coming back to claim the centre ground it had once abandoned. All that in a single speech. </p> <p>The explanation for Kinnock's success 15 years ago is not too complex. For that address contained one of the core ingredients of any good speech: confrontation. Margaret Thatcher had played the same trick just three years earlier, when she used her conference turn to round on critics who had demanded a U-turn in policy. \"You turn if you want to she said,\" she boomed famously. \"The lady's not for turning.\" </p> <p>Nor is such aggressive speech-making confined to politics. Earl Spencer sent shock-waves through Westminster Abbey and beyond when he turned on the royal family during his funeral oration for his sister Diana in 1997. Speaking for Diana's \"blood family\", he promised to let the souls of Diana's sons sing - unmistakably damning the stifling grip of the stuffy Windsors. Which is not to say that the decisive speech always works wonders for the speaker. On the contrary, careers can be broken as well as made by the unpredictable alchemy of orator, audience and text. Spencer's own fall from grace was speeded by a public perception that he had failed abjectly to live up to his rhetoric. Michael Portillo made himself a national hate figure when he dragged the SAS into party politics with his Who Dares Wins address to the Conservative conference of 1995. His rant against the meddlers of Brussels and his bellicose revelling in British military prowess brought delighted squeals in the hall, but made him a poster boy for Tory extremism. He paid the price in the sheer national delight that greeted his ejection from the House of Commons two years later. </p> <p>His former Cabinet ally Peter Lilley also learned of the lethal power of an ill-judged talk. As the Tories' deputy leader in 1999, he chose to mark the 20th anniversary of Margaret Thatcher's arrival in Downing Street with a lecture apparently recanting the old Thatcherite faith in the free market's ability to deliver public services. The backlash from the Conservative true believers was so intense that Lilley had to pay with his job - removed as William Hague's number two and booted out of the shadow cabinet. </p> <p>Speeches have turned nearly as sour for Tony Blair. When he looks back on the annus horribilis that 2000 has been for Labour, a particularly bitter memory will be the slow hand-clap he received from the Women's Institute. He gave a speech that they deemed too political and they booed him for it. Or he may cast his mind back even further, to the roots of the current trouble, by recalling his address to last year's Labour conference, when he declared war on the \"forces of conservatism\". A right-wing press which had previously given a free pass to Blair decided that New Labour's honeymoon was over: from that day onwards something of the old left-right struggle returned to our national life. </p> <p>So speeches can still be decisive, for good or ill. They don't work the way myth said they once did: hostile audiences are rarely won over with a few poetic sentences. Nor are there many of the great phrase-makers of yore - Kennedy and his \"new frontier\", Churchill and his \"iron curtain\". Still, it is possible to train oneself into good oratory. Bill Clinton is rated as perhaps the best communicator on the planet, but when, as a little-known state governor, he delivered a keynote address to the 1988 Democratic convention, he rambled and stuttered so badly that delegates cheered when he finally left the stage. </p> <p>For all that, the improved Clinton is proof that an address written well and delivered better can change minds. Not by reaching a nation all at once - that only happens through television. But if a speaker convinces the people in the hall and, crucially, impresses the journalists present, then the climate of opinion can change. If every commentator tonight and tomorrow says Blair did well, then he will have done well: it will soon settle into the collective cortex that the PM has reasserted his grip. And that message will reach millions more than the select group of activists and addicts who will actually watch today's speech. </p> <p>These are the times we live in - our politics reliant on an ancient form, refracted through the medium of today. Or, put another way, \"traditional values in a modern setting\". Hmm, that's got quite a nice ring to it. I wonder if Tony might want to weave that into paragraph four...</p>",
  "If the opposition to President Milosevic took a gamble in confronting him in Sunday's election, it faces an even more daunting task in the next few days. While the prospect of victory is real, it can be chilling and the embattled dictator will try hard to scare his opponents or buy off their leaders. <p>He may well be testing them to see if he can get away with claiming a first round victory, or whether he has to concede a second round. </p> <p>Opposition leaders were at least standing firm yesterday. \"There will be no bargaining,\" Zoran Djindjic, the leader of the Democratic party, said. \"Milosevic should better avoid tormenting the people since he would be wiped out in the runoff.\" The opposition challenger, Vojislav Kostunica, broke from Mr Djindjic's party in the early 1990s so the two men have a history of disagreement. </p> <p>More question marks hang over the two parties whose candidates will be eliminated if there is a second round. Vojislav Seselj's ultra-nationalist Radical party is still officially part of Mr Milosevic's ruling coalition, even though it fielded a separate candidate on Sunday. Before the first round Mr Seselj also repeatedly said his party would vote against Mr Milosevic in any second round. </p> <p>But Mr Seselj is a notorious opportunist as well as being fiercely ambitious. He was widely considered to have won the last presidential elections in Serbia but was defrauded of the result - whether through blackmail, death threats or the offer of a lucrative post is unknown. Now he is in a strong bargaining position with both Mr Milosevic and the opposition even though his party may have won less than 5% of the vote. </p> <p>Equally intriguing will be the conduct of the Serbian Renewal party, which used to be the strongest opposition group. Its vain and volatile leader, Vuk Draskovic, refused to join the 18-party coalition of Mr Kostunica, gravely weakening Mr Draskovic's already fragile authority and making him appear unprincipled. </p> <p>Mr Draskovic was formerly a deputy prime minister in Mr Milosevic's government and commands little trust among many liberal Serbs. He seemed yesterday to be trying to recoup his position within the opposition ranks by congratulating Mr Kostunica from his beach home in Montenegro where he has been in self-imposed exile after assassination attempts. \"I'd like to express my hope that Mr Milosevic will recognise the election and the will of the people,\" he added. </p> <p>He even expressed regret that his party had not joined the Democratic Opposition of Serbia bloc, which launched Mr Kostunica's can didacy in July. \"The results are a consequence of an ill-advised decision by the party leadership, including myself, to run in the elections on our own,\" he said. </p> <p>Ideologically, the opposition contains a mixture of political ideas, from monarchists, conservatives and nationalists to social democrats and liberals. The only common factor is a desire to see Mr Milosevic removed from power.</p>",
  "Relief spread through the pro-western government of Montenegro yesterday, its leaders apparently convinced that Slobodan Milosevic would have less chance of provoking violence after faring badly in Yugoslavia's elections. <p>Montenegro's deputy prime minister, Dragisa Burzan, said he believed that the main opposition candidate, Vojislav Kostunica, had won an outright victory in the presidential poll, and predicted that Mr Milosevic would soon be forced from power. </p> <p>\"I'd expect quite a quick removal of Milosevic. It cannot be more than at most a month of manoeuvring,\" he said in Podgorica. </p> <p>Mr Burzan said the president was growing desperate as his support ebbed and claimed that the atmosphere in Mr Milosevic's inner circle was \"like a funeral\". </p> <p>He was confident, he said, that the Yugoslav army and police would not support Mr Milosevic after seeing that he had such narrow backing. </p> <p>He felt that low levels of support for Mr Milosevic also helped to cut the chances of armed intervention in Montenegro which has very mixed feelings about its federation with Serbia; together they make up Yugoslavia. \"Tension is less _ I think he will be focused only on Serbia at the moment. I think he cannot now undertake anything in Montenegro.\" </p> <p>As rumours grew of disarray among the Serbian ruling elite in Belgrade, there were reports that the Yugoslav prime minister, Momir Bulatovic, a Montenegrin and a Milosevic loyalist, had resigned. </p> <p>But the main pro-Belgrade party in Montenegro dismissed the reports. \"I wouldn't pay much attention to this. It's not true,\" Zoran Zizic, the deputy leader of the Socialist Peoples' party, said in Podgorica. He went on to accuse the Montena-Fax news agency of spreading wrong information. </p> <p>Earlier, quoting a senior source in the Socialist Peoples' party, the agency had said that Mr Bulatovic had resigned after failing to meet a demand from President Milosevic to provide him with \"an extra 100,000 votes\". </p> <p>\"Having realised the election result was disastrous, Milosevic issued an ultimatum to Bulatovic to allocate another 100,000 votes through the military leadership and [army chief of staff] General Nebojsa Pavkovic,\" the agency said. </p> <p>It quoted the party source as saying that \"forged election material was to be transported to Podgorica by a military plane under General Pavkovic's orders, to be passed on to the election commission for 'verification'\". </p> <p>Mr Zizic called the report \"media lies\". He said that turnout in Montenegro, which has barely 5% of the Yugoslav electorate, was slightly below the 130,000 originally estimated, but reiterated that his party had won 90% of votes counted so far. </p> <p>The Montenegrin government boycotted the vote and denounced it as an unconstitutional farce. It left pro-Belgrade parties to organise their own elections in makeshift polling stations. </p> <p>Meanwhile, as the first results emerged in the province of Kosovo in Serbia, a mixture of apathy and resignation set in among Serbs there. </p> <p>In spite of numerous allegations of electoral fraud, both Mr Milosevic's ruling Serbian Socialist party (SPS) and the opposition alliance of parties trying to oust him agreed he got the majority of votes. </p> <p>In the divided town of Mitrovice, Mr Milosevic had claimed his party had won with 3,500 votes, compared with 800 for Mr Kostunica. In other towns the SPS claimed three-quarters of the vote. </p> <p>The leader of the Serbian Democratic party in Mitrovice, Dragisa Djokovic, put the large margin down to the fact that many opposition supporters were not on the voting lists. But he admitted that many of the 100,000 Serbs in Kosovo had voted for Mr Milosevic in the hope that Yugoslav troops would one day return to the province. Kosovo's Albanian community boycotted Sunday's vote. </p> <p>Mr Djokovic said: \"There are a lot of reasons, one of them is people's disappointment in the international community.\" </p> <p>For the most part, Kosovo's interest in the election results has been muted. TVs and radios in Mitrovice's cafes and shops could be heard announcing the results, but few people seemed pay attention. </p> <p>Most roadside stallholders were reluctant to say who they had voted for. But one woman selling clothing said with a smile: \"I have always voted for him. I don't know why, it's just a sort of tradition.\" </p> <p>Nearby a man selling wires and batteries implied he had voted for Mr Kostunica. \"People are afraid to vote for change, they think change is something terrible.\" </p> <p>Back at the opposition's headquarters Mr Djokovic said the key to the next few days would lie in Serbia. </p> <p>\"Belgrade decides what happens here. Our primary concern here is to have peace and avoid any incident.\"</p>",
  "Western leaders tried to bounce President Slobodan Milosevic from office yesterday in the wake of Yugoslavia's chaotic election. <p>Even though not a single ballot result had been announced, west European countries insisted that the Belgrade leader had lost overwhelmingly and should admit defeat. </p> <p>Foreign ministries throughout Europe and the US talked to eachother throughout Sunday night and agreed to act in concert. They organised a strong coalition for what they see as one of the best chances yet to oust him from office after an election turnout that exceeded their expectations. </p> <p>They moved quickly to try to exploit the disarray by claiming he had lost overwhelmingly and should stand down. </p> <p>The west has little sway over Mr Milosevic but it can influence public opinion in Serbia by discrediting any attempt by the president to hang on. </p> <p>Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, also met the Russian president, Vladimir Putin - the one leader who may have some influence over Mr Milosevic. He urged Mr Putin to encourage Mr Milosevic to give way. </p> <p>Mr Schr\u00f6der, speaking at a press conference with Mr Putin in Moscow, said: \"We agreed _ that it looks as though Serbia and Yugoslavia have decided in favour of democratic change.\" Mr Putin did not dissent. </p> <p>Although the west European governments know that Mr Milosevic will not capitulate easily, given that he faces the prospect of trial at the Hague for war crimes, they will do everything possible to undermine him in the hope that the Serbian population will finallyinsist that he goes. </p> <p>Nato is building up its forces in the region. British defence and diplomatic sources said this was in case Mr Milosevic tried to divert attention by creating trouble in Kosovo or Montenegro, but a conflagration was not expected. </p> <p>The sources insisted Nato would not go to war over Montenegro. </p> <p>The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, said: \"Today Milosevic is a beaten, broken-backed president. The margin of defeat appears too great to fix through electoral fraud. My message to him today is to be honest with your people, do not cheat them. Get out of the way and let Serbia out of the prison into which you have turned it.\" </p> <p>The White House national security adviser, PJ Crowley, said it would be hard for Mr Milosevic to make a \"credible claim of victory\" because of strong opposition support and reported voting irregularities. </p> <p>Mr Crowley said: \"They haven't announced any election results at this point but the reliable information coming out of Yugoslavia suggests that the opposition has done very well.\" </p> <p>In Brussels, the EU insisted that Mr Milosevic could not declare himself the winner. \"It is clear that any attempt by Milosevic to declare himself the victor would be fraudulent,\" the EU said in a joint statement released by France, which holds the rotating presidency. </p> <p>The statement said the high turnout showed that the people of Serbia wanted change. </p> <p>\"They wanted to speak up, regardless of intimidation, manoeuvring, pressure and all sorts of manipulation by the Belgrade regime leading up to this ballot,\" said the statement. </p> <p>Javier Solana, the EU's foreign policy supremo, and Nato secretary-general during last year's Kosovo war, said Yugoslavia had to respect the will of its people. </p> <p>\"The people of Serbia have delivered an overwhelming vote for change. The turnout is remarkable by any standards. The clearly expressed will of the voters must now be translated into reality. The people of Serbia deserve nothing less,\" he said. </p> <p>Before the presidential and parliamentary elections on Sunday, the EU had pleaded with the Serbian people to turn out and vote to remove Mr Milosevic. Last week it repeated its promise to lift sanctions and offered reconstruction aid and help the country out of its international isolation. Nato made no comment yesterday, insisting that the election was a political, not a military matter. </p> <p>The party of the Western-backed Bosnian Serb prime minister, Milorad Dodik, saluted what it said was electoral defeat for Mr Milosevic. </p> <p>\"The defeat of Slobodan Milosevic is the defeat of the forces of the past, the defeat of the politics of conflict and isolation,\" the Party of Independent Social Democrats said. </p> <p>The Croatian president, Stipe Mesic, predicted that Mr Milosevic would do anything to stay in power in Yugoslavia, no matter how much blood had to be shed. </p> <p>\"Remaining in power is the only guarantee for him to stay alive, not politically but literally alive,\" Mr Mesic said in a state radio interview </p> <p>The British shadow foreign secretary, Francis Maude, said Serbs were tired of Mr Milosevic's \"gross misrule\". </p> <p>Mr Maude said: \"He must now step down. Whatever the election results, Kosovo's Albanians are clear that they do not wish to be governed from Belgrade. The international community now needs to take urgent steps to address this.\" </p> <p><b>Useful links</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.serbia-info.com\" target=\"_NEW\"> Serbian ministry of information</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.dos.org.yu\" target=\"_NEW\">Serbian Democratic Opposition</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/www/regions/eur/990527_kosovo_indictment.html\" target=\"_NEW\">International Criminal Tribunal indictment of Milosevic</a></p>",
  "There is nothing like an oil crisis to spread feelings of empowerment around the Middle East. Last week even Palestinians - whose only oil comes from olives - were suggesting that here was a weapon their friends could use to further the struggle with Israel. <p>Suddenly everyone in the region is aware of how much the world depends on them. The Middle East holds two-thirds of the world's proven oil reserves and, at current rates of production, it will last for 87 years, compared with 14 years for North American oil and eight years for European. And our dependence on the Middle East is increasing. The US Department of Energy predicts that 10 years from now the region will be called upon to produce about 30% more oil. </p> <p>Given the political uncertainties in the region, the risks are obvious. Among the Middle Eastern producers, Saudi Arabia is way ahead of the rest, providing 12% of the world's oil and holding more than a quarter of the known reserves. It is the only country capable of influencing prices single-handed, by turning the taps on and off - or it was until recently. </p> <p>In return for exercising this power responsibly, the west guarantees Saudi Arabia's security and doesn't complain too loudly about its record on human rights. </p> <p>But now this arrangement faces a challenge from Iraq. Following the recent Opec production increases, Iraqi production - currently just over 3m barrels a day - exceeds the world's readily available spare capacity. If supplies from Iraq were interrupted, by accident or design, havoc would ensue. </p> <p>On its own, that makes Iraq no different from other producers of similar size - Iran, Norway and Venezuela, for example - though it's worth noting that Iraq is one of the six largest suppliers to the United States. But in combination with Iraq's pariah status and the unpredictability of Saddam Hussein, it is potentially devastating. </p> <p>\"Five years ago, the Iraqi president, in his most fantastic dreams, never thought he would find himself in the position he is in today,\" says Jareer Elass of the Washington-based Oil Navigator consultancy. \"Tight oil markets, a world weary of sanctions, and an American presidential election - there's no way Saddam is going to let this pass.\" </p> <p>Chance has delivered Saddam a powerful weapon, and it is easy to see how he might use it: to end sanctions (on Iraq's terms), roll back the no-fly zones, and get out of paying several hundred billion dollars in Gulf war compensation. \"The Iraqis are trying to bargain with the UN and oil companies to keep oil production going in exchange for a pledge to remove sanctions,\" a Kuwaiti official said last week. </p> <p>But Iraq may be in less of a mood for bargaining than for testing UN-imposed restrictions to destruction in the belief that a world desperate for Iraqi oil, and suffering from sanctions fatigue, will be powerless to resist. </p> <p>The re-opening of Baghdad airport and the arrival of the first Russian and French flights is one crack that Iraq hopes to widen while the oil crisis lasts. \"Once we have regular civilian flights from Moscow, Amman and Paris, sanctions will be at an end,\" an Iraqi spokesman said. </p> <p>There are several other chinks. Earlier this month an Iraqi military plane infringed Saudi airspace for the first time in more than a decade, and there have been Iraqi incursions into the demilitarised sea zone off Kuwait. </p> <p>The success or otherwise of Saddam's strategy will depend on whether he can convince the world that he really would turn off the taps if it came to the crunch. Western analysts generally dismiss the idea on the grounds that he would be punishing himself by cutting off his only significant source of income. </p> <p>But it might not be so costly for Saddam. The high oil prices of the last few months, plus recent production increases, have given him a cash windfall. Estimates vary, but it could be enough to see Iraq through several weeks - possibly even a couple of months - of zero oil revenue. </p> <p>A second factor to bear in mind is that Iraq stands to lose less from cutting off its oil than other producers. The regime receives only half the total revenue from its oil production; the UN deducts the rest to pay compensation to Gulf war victims, feed Kurdish areas of Iraq, and to meet administration costs of the oil-for-food programme. </p> <p>If Iraq did decide to cut off supplies, the time of maximum impact would probably be at the end of October - just before the US presidential election. But there are problems with that. Under the current phase of the oil-for-food programme, Iraq is contracted to supply oil until December 4. Saddam might not be unduly worried by the legalities, but he does have to consider his long-term business relationships with the oil companies. </p> <p>It would be easier to turn off the taps in December, but by then the impact might be less because increased Opec production would have begun to replenish stockpiles. </p> <p>In either case, Iraq would need a plausible reason and, even if it found one, would risk losing the goodwill which it has carefully built up with countries such as France over the past 10 years. </p> <p>Psychologically, the oil weapon is very similar to a nuclear bomb because it tends to harm the user as well as the victim: its effectiveness lies in threatening to use it but not actually doing so. </p> <p>That requires subtle and precisely calculated tactics, which may be beyond Saddam's capability. The risks are certainly high and he may eventually back off. But, given the region's dominance of the oil markets, he will probably not be the last person to try. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:analysis@theguardian.com\">analysis@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Few people in the west have spent more time with Slobodan Milosevic than Richard Holbrooke, currently the US ambassador at the United Nations. Holbrooke's autobiography even has an index entry for \"Milosevic: charm of\". There are six separate page-references. On his first encounter with the Yugoslav president, the word is that Milosevic was \"smart, charming, and evasive\". On another occasion we read of Milosevic being \"at his most charming, lighting up a huge Monte Cristo cigar\". The climax to this adulation came at a hunting lodge outside Belgrade where, over copious amounts of alcohol, the Americans were negotiating Bosnia's future. One of Holbrooke's team described the 12-hour session with the Serbian leader as \"bonding with the godfather\". <p>Evil strongmen have always exercised an inordinate fascination on those who deal with them, particularly on foreigners who cannot fully understand their culture and are safe from their clutches. Holbrooke is no fool as a negotiator and - certainly for a man who has long hoped to be secretary of state in a Gore administration - he is not unguarded enough in his autobiography to suggest he made any concessions to Milosevic. But it was Holbrooke who personified more than any other diplomat the west's willingness to do business with Milosevic, first over Croatia, then Bosnia and finally Kosovo. </p> <p>Holbrooke and the west continued to hope for a face-saving deal until the last moment, before Milosevic's intransigence made intervention in Kosovo inevitable in March last year. When the international criminal tribunal in the Hague indicted Milosevic for war crimes two months later, in full conformity with the west's new view of the man they had accepted as a legitimate partner for so long, western governments were relieved. Now their fragile consciences had the crutch of an externally imposed defence against future temptation. However much they might secretly crave one last chance to sup with him, they knew Milosevic was no longer a fit companion. </p> <p>On Sunday Serbian voters came to the same conclusion. The enormity of their choice has surprised everyone, including the man they have rejected. It may yet be that he still claims victory. Alternatively, he may admit he lost this round and throw the election into a run-off in two weeks' time - with the hope of splitting the opposition through threats or bribes or, if that fails, organising a better ballot-rigging exercise in the next round. </p> <p>For the moment two things stand out. For the first time in over a decade Milosevic has lost the initiative. Instead of being three moves ahead of every other player, whether they be envoys of foreign powers or his domestic critics, he is on the back foot, desperately playing for time and looking for manoeuvres to escape. This new role will do wonders for the silent opposition within his own ranks. Dictators thrive on their image of invincibility. Once the colossus begins to wobble, the henchmen start to look for their own way out. Secret contacts with the opposition may have begun already. They are certain to grow over the coming days. </p> <p>The second conclusion is that, however the final count goes, Milosevic has been repudiated by the most important section of the Serbian electorate. The younger generation, urban voters, the better educated, and those Serbs who have the closest contact with the huge diaspora of Serbs abroad, many of whom are refugees from the Milosevic years, turned out against him. They too now see he is a man with whom no legitimate business can be done. They understand that more Milosevic means more penury and more isolation. </p> <p>It is a change of historic proportions. In world terms Milosevic's defeat sends an encouraging signal. Those who come to power by the sword usually perish by the sword. Here is almost the first case of a dictator who came to power by the ballot perishing by the ballot. Milosevic was not originally a nationalist. But like many other rulers in the epoch of communism's collapse he used the instrument of nationalism to \"re-badge\" himself and stay in power, in the process betraying those in the Communist Party who had promoted him. Once enthroned, he caught the nationalist fever, projecting himself through the monopoly over the state media which he inherited from the Communist Party as the only true defender of Serbia's interests. While everywhere else in the communist world democratic institutions were gradually emerging, Milosevic in Serbia stifled them. What had in Tito's time been the least closed of communist societies became under Milosevic the least open. The media, the universities and the judiciary were all repressed. </p> <p> Latinka Perovic, the distinguished historian of modern Serbia who led the reformist wing of the League of Communists in Serbia in the early 1970s until she was sacked by Tito, described recently how Milosevic \"developed to the highest degree the most negative features of the previous system: wilfulness, the absence of competition, totalitarianism\". Other Serb intellectuals have pointed out that Serbs, like Russians, have long been torn between the westernising tendencies of the enlightenment and slavophilia. In Serbia's case the romantic nationalism which started in the 19th century as the Ottoman empire first began to weaken turned into a pipe-dream of trying to restore the medieval Serbian state. This was the imperial mirage of Greater Serbia which Milosevic co-opted. </p> <p>Sadly, part of the Serbian academic community went along with Milosevic, as did the leadership of the Orthodox church. They forgave him his communism because of his nationalist pretensions. Over the years they have all abandoned him - from Dobrisa Cosic, the doyen of the intellectual chauvinists, to Serbia's Patriarch Pavle. Even the army high command has lost faith in Milosevic, with many of the generals who backed him in his wars in Croatia and Bosnia now with the opposition. Milosevic no longer represents anyone outside a tiny coterie of cronies. Few Serbs have put it more starkly than Obrad Savic, the philosopher-president of the Belgrade Circle, who was dismissed from his university post in May. \"Serbia\", he said in July, \"is a non-transparent, non-cooperative, disconnected society full of brutality, aggression, narrow-mindedness and egoism, a totally fragmented and riven society, living in a million parallel worlds\". </p> <p>Faced with this legacy, it was perhaps inevitable that, at some moment, Serbs of many different political persuasions would unite in the name of the most basic patriotism to rescue their state from the great usurper. Probably only an opposition candidate who was himself a nationalist should have led the final resistance. Vojislav Kostunica is a lifelong anti-communist who subscribes to the imperial ideology and the myths of Serb victimhood. His attraction was, and is, his financial honesty, his lack of political ambition and the fact that he has never been part of the Milosevic regime. </p> <p>He describes himself as a transitional figure, and seems to mean it. No society can recover quickly from the intellectual and moral corruption that the Milosevic regime produced. The debate between a liberal, modernising Serbia and those who still cling to nationalist delusions will go on. But whatever happens in the next week or two, Serbia is on the road back to sanity at last. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:j.steele@theguardian.com\">j.steele@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Howard Johnson, who has died aged 89, was the Conservative MP for Brighton-Kemptown from 1950-59, and considered himself a radical. He demonstrated this by crusading against local police and council corruption, animal cruelty and capital punishment. <p>Educated at Highgate school and Brighton College, Johnson qualified as a solicitor in 1933 and set up in Brighton, where his mother's family had been Tory councillors and aldermen. Having joined the Territorials, he was called up in 1939, served in the Royal Artillery in Africa, and was invalided out in 1943. </p> <p>In 1945, he was elected to Brighton council, and, in the 1950 general election, won the new Kemptown seat by 3,001 votes. He seemed a safe bet, with the added glamour of being married to a popular former music-hall artiste, Betty Frankiss. He crusaded against the promenade sale of dirty postcards and rampaging gangs of teddy boys. </p> <p>Johnson only began to get under local skins after consolidating his position in the 1955 general election. He began to feed information to the Scotland Yard team investigating local police corruption, and in 1956 was one of the first Tory MPs to vote against capital punishment. When constituents complained, he told them: \"If you want a voting delegate, a mere robot, then the sooner you have someone else, the better pleased I shall be.\" </p> <p>The following year, Johnson became more vocal on his hatred of animal cruelty, having deplored the casualties at one year's Grand National, when only four horses finished. When a hind was drowned by the Devon and Somerset Staghounds after being hunted for five hours, he said deerhunting was a disgraceful practice, \"which prevents our calling ourselves a civilised nation\". He was frozen out by fellow Tory MPs. </p> <p>By 1958, Johnson had ceased to be a Tory and decided not to stand again for parliament. Instead, he tried to move the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals off the fence on fox-hunting - and was expelled for \"conduct prejudicial to the interests of the society\". Then in 1963, as vice-president of the League Against Cruel Sports, he urged members to squat in the roads, risking death at the hands of riders. \"If they kill you, they will stand a very fine chance of hanging or imprisonment,\" he said. </p> <p>In 1964, Johnson sought to re-enter parliament, rejoining the Tories and fruitlessly urging his old constituency party to select him again. His zigzags continued into old age, when he joined CND, opposed the Brighton bypass, and, by the 1980s, supported Labour. He continued as a local solicitor, and a director of the Alliance Building Society (later the Alliance and Leicester), in retirement on the Isle of Man. </p> <p>He outlived his second wife, Betty, and his son by his first wife. </p> <p> \u0095 Howard Sydney Johnson, politician, born December 25 1910; died September 13 2000</p>",
  "Vice President Al Gore mounted a campaign offensive on health care yesterday in an attempt to recapture wavering women voters, after his poll lead evaporated over his Republican opponent, George W Bush. <p>Campaigning in Florida, Mr Gore unveiled a 74-page booklet explaining how he proposes to deal with the crisis facing Medicare, the state-funded health system for pensioners, which is emerging as one of the key policy battlegrounds of the presidential elections. </p> <p>A Gallup poll published yesterday showed Mr Bush ahead of the vice president by 47 per cent to 46 per cent. The lead is statistically insignificant, but a psychological blow to the Gore camp which had amassed a 10 per cent lead since the beginning of the month and believed its campaign was gathering momentum. </p> <p>A breakdown of yesterday's polling figures showed that most of the swing was accounted for by radical shifts among women. A week ago, Mr Gore was leading by 17 per cent among women voters. In yesterday's poll that margin had been reduced to four per cent, perhaps a sign of success of Mr Bush's appearance last week on the Oprah Winfrey television chat-show which has an overwhelmingly female audience. </p> <p>The problems of Medicare are also believed to be a particular important issue among swing women voters, possibly because women live longer and because it is more often daughters than sons who look after ailing elderly parents. </p> <p>The burning health issue in the election has become the crippling cost of medicines. The amount Americans spend on prescription drugs has almost doubled since 1995 from $65 billion to $125 billion, and with a huge phalanx of baby-boomers approaching 60, that bill is expected to rise to $243 billion. Medicare provides no coverage for drug costs. Fifty million Americans have no private insurance coverage either and have to pay for medicines out of their own pocket. </p> <p>The proposals Mr Gore unveiled yesterday involve an injection of $338 billion of government spending over the next ten years to provide prescription drug coverage within Medicare for a $25 monthly premium. The government would cover all medicine costs if they passed an annual threshold of $ 4,000. He also proposed greater financial penalties for private health insurance companies which opt out of the Medicare programme because it is not sufficiently profitably </p> <p>\"Medicare faces insolvency unless we act now,\" the Vice President said yesterday. \"I want to make a rock-solid commitment to Medicare.\" </p> <p>Mr Bush portrayed the Gore health plan as a bureaucratic nightmare in the making. Instead he is offering to spend $158 billion over the next decade to provide subsidies to the elderly covering 25 per cent of their prescription coverage insurance, leaving it to them to chose an insurance plan. </p> <p>Buoyed by the apparent recovery in the polls, the Bush camp yesterday maintained an offensive on Mr Gore's integrity. Mr Bush's spokesman, Ari Fleischer accused the Democratic candidate of planting a spy at the Bush headquarters in Austin, Texas. </p> <p>A junior Gore aide was suspended last week after boasting he knew of a Democratic \"mole\" in the Bush camp. The aide, Michael Doyne, said he had been making the story up, but Mr Fleischer dismissed the claim and said \"it defies credibility\" that Mr Doyne was the only Gore campaign official who would know about an infiltration attempt. </p> <p>The possibility of a covert Democratic sympathiser was working in Austin was raised when a videotape of Mr Bush preparing for next months presidential debates was delivered to one of Mr Gore's aides earlier this month. The aide turned the tape over to investigators immediately, and the FBI began an investigation over the weekend. </p>",
  "France's political elite was reeling yesterday after the highly damaging allegations of kickbacks centred on the president, Jacques Chirac, spread to embroil a former Socialist finance minister and dragged in the name of the celebratedfashion designer, Karl Lagerfeld. <p>Dominique Strauss-Kahn, a leading ministerial light until forced by graft allegations to resign from Lionel Jospin's cabinet last year, admitted that for nearly two years he had been sitting on potentially devastating corruption evidence against Mr Chirac.</p> <p>The disgraced former finance minister confirmed he had been given a now-infamous videotape last April in which Jean-Claude M\u00e9ry, a property developer and senior official in Mr Chirac's RPR party, directly implicated the president in a vast covert fundraising operation.</p> <p>M\u00e9ry recorded the tape before dying of cancer last year. His lawyer gave the cassette to Mr Strauss-Kahn - apparently in the hope that as finance minister he would arrange a massive tax break for another of the lawyer's clients, the couturier Karl Lagerfeld.</p> <p>Amid mounting suspicion in RPR ranks that the Socialist party was responsible for the release of the tape to French media last week, an embattled President Chirac immediately called for an investigation into \"the possible involvement of Mr Strauss-Kahn in this very serious matter\".</p> <p>After a morning crisis meeting the prime minister, Mr Jospin, promised to hold a swift inquiry and said the finance ministry would hand over all relevant documents to magistrates later in the day. Mr Jospin is anxious to prevent any further fallout on his ruling coalition.</p> <p>Mr Strauss-Kahn, a lawyer by training and a close friend of the prime minister, admitted he had received the original of the tape from M\u00e9ry's counsel, Alain Belot, but denied he had ever watched it and claimed he did not even know where it was.</p> <p>\"I knew Belot as a tax lawyer and because he had worked with the parliament's tax committee,\" Mr Strauss-Kahn told Le Monde. \"He gave me a tape and said: 'Have a look at that, it's interesting.' He said it was about illicit RPR fundraising at Paris town hall, but he never told me the president was implicated.\"</p> <p>The former Socialist minister, already under investigation for alleged false accounting at his law firm, could now face charges of obstructing justice for having withheld the tape - especially as Mr Belot is reported to have told police that Mr Strauss-Kahn asked him last week not to reveal the fact that he had the tape.</p> <p>Before his fall from grace, Mr Strauss-Kahn had been hotly tipped as the Socialist party's candidate for Paris mayor in next year's municipal election. The tape, detailing allegations of institutionalised RPR corruption at Paris town hall, would have been a powerful electoral asset.</p> <p>Mr Lagerfeld's fashion house declined all comment on the story, but according to French media the couturier was indeed the subject of a big tax investigation and faced a \u00a330m demand last year after it emerged he had not paid any tax in France for six years.</p> <p>One paper said that he eventually paid just \u00a35m, though there is no evidence that any special favour was granted by the authorities.</p> <p>Mr Strauss-Kahn rejected all allegations of wrongdoing. He told French radio that he denied \"all political connections that people are trying to make, as well as any connections with any tax dossier\" involving Mr Lagerfeld.</p> <p>The extraordinary tale of widespread corruption in high places began to emerge last week when Le Monde printed, in two consecutive issues over some six pages, the transcript of M\u00e9ry's tape, which the businessman recorded in 1996 \"in case anything happens to me\".</p> <p>He claimed that he was in charge of a many-tentacled system whereby construction companies paid big bribes to win maintenance, heating and other contracts for city-owned housing blocks while Mr Chirac was mayor of Paris.</p> <p>The vast majority of the money, he said, went to Mr Chirac's RPR.</p> <p>The allegations from beyond the grave, which dropped like a bombshell in Paris and were furiously denied by Mr Chirac, were the latest in a string of corruption accusations levelled against the president pertaining to the period from 1977 to 1995 when he was mayor.</p>"
