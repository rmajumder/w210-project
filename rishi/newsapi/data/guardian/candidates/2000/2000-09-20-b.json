  "Buoyed by their best opinion poll result for five years, Liberal Democrat leaders yesterday predicted they would win more seats than their current 47 at the coming general election, and could even double their numbers at the expense of Labour and the Conservatives. <p>Charles Kennedy has been cautious about the advice of Lord Rennard, his polling pundit, who noted that 50 southern Tory seats have majorities smaller than the one which fell to the Lib Dems at the Romsey byelection this spring. </p> <p>But this week's Guardian/ICM opinion poll gave Mr Kennedy's troops 22% - one point more than NOP's 21% in the Sunday Times - as angry voters defected from Labour but gave William Hague only half the swing votes. </p> <p>At the party conference yesterday the mood was much more upbeat. Mr Kennedy blamed Labour's collapse on \"institutional arrogance\" while his campaigns chief, Lord Razzell, told delegates: \"Order the champagne for the day after the election. We will be celebrating winning more seats and more votes than in 1997. </p> <p>\"The evidence is there. I am not just talking about the opinion polls - no, I am talking about the hard evidence of real votes cast by real people in real elections,\" said Lord Razzell, who reminded the 50 Tory MPs vulnerable post-Romsey: \"Watch out, Liberal Democrats are after you.\" </p> <p>He promised delegates that the Lib Dem campaign - \"honest, confident, positive\" - would never compromise, as Labour had, on issues such as pensions, Europe, race, public services or the environment. </p> <p>Last night's party political broadcast showed Mr Kennedy making similar claims while warning that, though Labour had proved better for the NHS and education than the Tories, Mr Blair had \"wasted three years\" following Tory tax plans. \"You need to watch Labour like a hawk, they are forever claiming to be spending more money than they have,\" he said. </p> <p>Lib Dems analysts say they have some basis for hoping to hold their seats and make even modest gains in the coming election, because there are signs that sitting MPs benefit from first-time incumbency when defending their patch. </p> <p>If Mr Hague can get his core vote out and gain some centre ground Mr Kennedy's hopes could go pear-shaped. But Lord Razzell summed up the optimism in Bournemouth when he said: \"Labour a disappointment; Tories a disaster. So you can tell people how Liberal Democrats can make the difference.\"</p>",
  "Channel surfing at the Liberal Democrat conference. Brungg! Charles Kennedy is visiting the Royal Bournemouth hospital. A young patient in A&amp;E approaches him. \"May I shake you by the hand, Mr Kennedy? I'm a great admirer of yours. I voted for you in the last election, and I've just had major brain surgery.\" <p>Brangg! The walls of the conference are festooned with posters: \"Positive Action - Dholakia's Battle Cry!\" This is a message so runic it could have been used as the basis of a Playfair code by agents in occupied France. Only a Liberal Democrat could possibly translate it. Elucidated, I think it means that in his speech Lord Dholakia, the incoming party president, had called for positive action. He didn't demand negative action, or positive sloth. His battle cry was not \"Leave well alone, fellow delegates,\" or \"Liberal Democrats, it's time for a kip!\" He wanted action, and he wanted it positive. </p> <p>Bweep! The delegates are voting. Nothing to do with voting is ever simple here. Lady Barker reads out the rules. \"The first vote will be on amendment one. The second vote will be about a separate vote on line 32. The third vote will be on amendment 2, and the fourth vote will be on the substantive motion.\" Nobody seemed fazed by this or even by the footnote to the motion, which includes the rubric: \"30-34 and 48-56 Federal; remainder England and Wales, except for 2 (e) which is England only.\" All clear? It was to them. </p> <p>Blapp! Simon Hughes, the \"shadow home secretary\", is railing against the Labour government's bill to restrict the right to trial by jury. He announces that Liberal peers will vote to throw out the bill at its second reading in the Lords next week. </p> <p>I can hardly believe my ears. The Lib Dems are always hammering on about how they are the only truly democratic party, the one which insists that the will of the people must be paramount. And now, here they are, proposing to throw out summarily a bill that has been passed in the elected house by a huge majority. All right, it's a lousy bill, but then what is the difference between unelected fuel protesters and a bunch of unelected Liberals, most of whom, so far as I can gather, owe their seats to the popular \"Attend 15 Lib Dem conferences and a win a free peerage\" scheme? </p> <p>Lords Razzall and Greaves and Russell and Newby and Wallace and Dholakia, and Ladies Barker, Maddock, Hamwee and Northover are all estimable, thoughtful people who have spent months of their lives at Liberal Democrat conferences, but, you may think, have no more right to decide the law of the land than Tinky-Winky, Dipsy, Laa-Laa and Po. But nobody seemed surprised. </p> <p>(Later Mr Hughes turned up for a picture stunt at Bournemouth police station, holding a mock Uzi submachine gun rather as if it were a pair of silver sugar tongs.) </p> <p>Blang! Off to a fringe meeting about freeing Tibet, addressed by monks. One, Tenzin Choktongtsang, describes his escape from his homeland. \"The first westerners we saw were a Yorkshire TV team who were making a film. We thought they must be refugees. Since then we have been to Yorkshire, and found it is better than China, except for Bradford.\" (No, of course he didn't say the last three words.) </p> <p>Later, to everyone's astonishment, a man from the Chinese embassy stands up and calmly defends the occupation. This is as sensational at a Lib Dem conference as someone demanding fewer civil rights for disabled people. </p> <p>Blupp! One of the exciting events coming to the Bournemouth International Centre soon is the Solid Gold tour, featuring Bobby Vee, Freddy Cannon, Brian Hyland and Little Eva. What a feast of nostalgia! And if any of them hang round town long enough, they'll probably get a peerage.</p>",
  "\u0095 Ken Livingstone has been rather quiet since his election triumph. But behind the scenes big issues are being dealt with - and few literally come bigger than who presides over the switching on of lights on the famous Christmas tree in Trafalgar Square. The tree (donated by a grateful Norway for Britain's efforts in the second world war) has traditionally been lit by the mayor of Oslo, with the Lord Mayor of Westminster in attendance. But in October responsibility for Trafalgar Square passes from the Department of Culture, Media and Sport to the mayor of London's office, and Ken wanted a cut of the tree action. \"The Lord Mayor can go to Norway and watch the thing being cut down if he wants, but Ken's going to switch it on. He is the mayor of London,\" one of Ken's aides was heard to say. Top-level talks last week between Westminster's lord mayor Michael Brahams and Ken led to a compromise, with the DCMS organising this year's festivities for one last time. \"Ken is going to be there as well,\" says press officer Helen Hall-Wright. <br> \u0095 We can sleep easier now the government is dealing with the threat of the earth being destroyed by asteroids. But what is being done about killer robots and giant mutant lizards? We rang the Number 10 press office to demand action on the robot-lizard threat, only to be fobbed off to the Cabinet Office. \"Oh, this came up yesterday,\" said a press officer, who suggested we try the DTI. \"Good God, I've got no idea,\" said Mark Haliford, the DTI's press officer for potentially hazardous near earth export commodities, \"I'm trying to think, is this really a matter for the department?\" Of course it is, Mark. \"Is there any evidence of these lizards, I mean asteroids, have actually hit the earth?\" Mark asks. That petty empirical view won't help, Mark.   \u0095 At least one transport company bucked the trend and froze its prices this year, in spite of \"above average increases in fuel tax\". It's the Government Car and Despatch Agency, which provides \"a high quality, secure environment in which ministers and others in public life can travel safely and in comfort, allowing them to concentrate on their work.\"  \u0095 Michela Wrong's new book In the Footsteps of Mr Kurtz (Fourth Estate, \u00a314) recounts some extraordinary tales of excess by Zaire's President Mobutu, funded in the main by the IMF and the World Bank. In his later years Mobutu retreated to a Xanadu-style folie de grandeur, complete with orange groves, musical fountains and imported Swiss cattle. But for visiting dignitaries, forced to travel 700 miles from Kinshasa, the worst part was being taken for a drive in the presidential Chevrolet. One US official found himself clinging on for his life as Mobutu careered along. \"It was like a cartoon, people and things were leaping out of the way,\" said the official. When his guests made mild remonstrations, the dictator replied: \"It's OK, these are all my roads.\"   \u0095 I'm grateful to my so-called rivals at The Register website for the charming tale of David Watkins, who wrote to BT complaining about poor service. BT replied: \"Dear Mr Watkins, I sincerely apologise for any incontinence caused over the last few weeks.\"  \u0095 This is, I am told, a true story, and since it was told to me by a man in a pub who read it on an email, who could doubt it? It involves a businessman waiting to meet a client in an airport VIP lounge. He spots Bill Gates sitting alone, and introduces himself. \"Could I ask a small favour?\" he says to Gates. \"I'm waiting for someone and when he arrives I'd be grateful if you could walk by, tap me on the shoulder and say hello.\" Bill graciously agrees, and when the client arrives, Bill taps the first man on the shoulder and says \"Hi!\" The man turns around and snarls: \"F*** off Gates, can't you see I'm busy!\" <a href=\"mailto:diary@theguardian.com\">diary@theguardian.com</a>",
  "Just 24 hours after he supposedly switched his campaign against Al Gore to focus on the big political issues, George W Bush found himself making strictly personal headlines again yesterday about his battle with the bottle and the things he said at a meeting with the Queen. <p>In what has now become an obligatory stop on the White House campaign trail, the Republican presidential candidate went cautiously confessional about his past in a Chicago interview with the television talkshow host Oprah Winfrey. </p> <p>\"Alcohol was beginning to compete for my affections - for my wife and my family,\" Mr Bush told the studio audience. \"It was beginning to crowd out my energy and I decided to quit, and it's one of the best decisions I've ever made.\" </p> <p>Mr Bush's former drinking problem has never been a secret, but this was the first time he had talked about it in any detail during this stage of the campaign. </p> <p>Though Mr Bush purports to enjoy the Oprah Winfrey \"touchy-feely\" style of interview, the encounter compelled him to tread a fine line between giving too much away about his closely guarded past excesses, while wooing the show's largely female audience by presenting himself as a redeemed sinner who had given up the booze for the sake of his wife and children. </p> <p>The Republican candidate neither confirmed nor denied that his wife, Laura, had threatened to leave him at the height of his drinking days, which came to an end more than 14 years ago after he went on one last bender in Colorado with a bunch of friends to mark their 40th birthdays. </p> <p>\"There's a lot of speculation,\" Mr Bush admitted, while referring to rumours that his wife had told him, \"It's either you or Jack Daniels\". </p> <p>\"I think she got disappointed some evenings. I was always a fairly disciplined person. I wasn't drinking all the time, but there were some times when she said you need to think about what you're doing. She understood it requires the person involved to make up their own mind,\" Mr Bush said. </p> <p>Earlier, Mr Bush was asked what he was referring to when he said, during his acceptance speech at the Republican convention last month, that there was a time when he had \"needed forgiveness\". </p> <p>\"When my heart turns dark, when I am jealous or when I'm spiteful,\" Mr Bush replied after a pause. </p> <p>\"I'm looking for specifics,\" Winfrey said in reply. </p> <p>\"I know you are, but I'm running for president,\" Mr Bush responded with a laugh. </p> <p>In submitting himself to ordeal by Oprah, the Republican candidate was following in the footsteps of Mr Gore, who appeared on the same show last week. </p> <p>Such prime-time interviews - along with campaign appearances by the candidates on the rival Jay Leno and David Letterman late night chatshows - have become an essential part of the US presidential campaign timetable, as the rivals seek to humanise themselves and to reach swing voters who would not dream of watching a more formal debate or political discussion programme. </p> <p>If they handle such appearances well, the candidates do not just reach out to the shows' target audiences, but also receive hours of \"free media\", as the clips from their interviews are replayed on other channels and news bulletins. </p> <p>Mr Gore was particularly successful in this respect last week when he made fun of himself on the Letterman show. Among the slogans that the Democratic candidate said he was contemplating using in the campaign were, \"Vote for me - or I will come round to your house and explain my 200-page economic plan in excruciating detail\" and, \"I gave you the internet, America, and I can take it back\". </p> <p>Mr Bush has looked nervous when he has gone on such programmes in the past, but he gave a more confident, if not entirely relaxed, performance on the Oprah show. There was only one of the now legendary \"Bushisms\", when the candidate said that he was someone who \"recognises the fallacy of humans\". </p> <p>During the hour-long interview - which was interrupted at one point by a protester complaining about US policy towards Iraq - Mr Bush was asked about the claim that he once told the Queen, at a dinner hosted by his father, that he was \"the black sheep\" of the Bush family. </p> <p>\"The Queen said, 'Are you the black sheep of the family?' I said, 'I don't know, do you have any in your family?' Like a good mother, she gave me a look,\" Mr Bush recalled. </p> <p>\"I respect the Queen a lot,\" he continued. \"I don't know what she thinks about me.\" </p> <p><b>Favourite things Beatles and baseball</b><br> <b> Al Gore</b><br> <b> Movie</b> Local Hero <br> <b> Breakfast cereal</b> Wheaties <br> <b> Book</b> The Red and the Black by Stendhal <br> <b> Subject at school</b>Science <br> <b> Group</b> Beatles <br> <b> Meal</b> Chinese <br> <b> Childhood memory</b> Playing baseball with my dad<br> </p> <p><b> George W Bush</b><br> <b> Sandwich</b> Peanut butter and jelly on white bread <br> <b> Given gift</b> Kissing my wife <br> <b> Gift received</b> Grandfather's cufflinks <br> <b> Fast food</b> Taco <br> <b> Cannot live without</b> Running three miles every day <br> <b> Song</b> Wake Up Little Suzie by the Everly Brothers <br> <b> Historical figure</b> Winston Churchill <br> <b> Dream</b> (He just smiled when asked this question) <br> <b> Prized possession</b> My ranch <br> <b> Childhood memory</b> Playing little league baseball in Midland, Texas</p>",
  "Political wives have never been so fascinating, or so it would seem from the amount of attention they have been getting in the US. The Democratic and Republican conventions have been packed with an unprecedented number of testimonials and introductions and cute jokes and homey anecdotes from wives and daughters, not as background, but as a central part of the campaign: elect this man, the message seemed to be, because he once brought his daughter toast and hot chocolate out in the snow. <p>It is interesting that after the long, boring impeachment, when the American public signalled that it couldn't care less about the private lives of its politicians, it is their private lives that are being endlessly promoted in the new political season. First there was the Gores' popular kiss that lasted several beats longer than it had to, and then there was Joe Lieberman, Gore's running mate, calling his wife Hadassah \"sweetheart\" during his acceptance speech. These are not public displays of affection so much as public displays of functionality. It is as if there is a pornographic picture in the back of everyone's mind of Monica Lewinsky in the oval office, and all the candidates all running as hard as they can against that picture with their own cheery vignettes of conjugal bliss. </p> <p>Part of this year's obsession with first marriages may also be that our politicians are so stage-managed, every gesture, every motion so scripted and second-guessed and polled, that there is some doubt as to who they really are. The media's favourite activity now is covering not the candidates, but their coaching, their pollsters and managers, advisers who tell them to wear greens and beiges, and speech writers who craft their rhetorical swells. You would have to be illiterate and without a television set to think that you are getting anywhere near the real man. Somehow, quite irrationally, this leads to the belief that when the candidates' wives come on to the stage in powder-blue suits, you are tapping in to their real lives. </p> <p>The fact that all of this is scripted, too, that the wives' collages of photographs, and daughters' affectionate reminiscences are also staged, doesn't seem to matter. These women - Tipper Gore, Laura Bush, Gore's daughters Karenna and Kristen, Hadassah Lieberman - are not professionals, or don't seem like professionals, and so there is a feeling when they come to the podium, awkward and shy, like Laura, or giddily cheery, like Tipper, that we are getting closer to the men themselves. But are these women humanising their husbands, or are we just reading a lot about how they humanise them? </p> <p>The candidates' wives are being used in a way that vice-presidents have traditionally been used - to balance the candidate, to compensate for a perceived weakness. The wives are not there to support their husbands but to subtly shift perceptions of them. For instance, George W Bush's drunken past, his volatile emotional side, his tendency to curse New York Times reporters, is counteracted by Laura's down-to-earth sweetness. He is \"grounded\" by her, everyone around them constantly tells us. She tempers his excesses. And in much the same way, Tipper's naturalness is offered by the campaign as an antidote to Gore's stiffness. She says that she has a \"commitment to have fun\" on the campaign trail, which does not seem like a commitment Gore has ever made to anyone about anything. </p> <p>And it is true that, at the convention, Tipper seemed at ease enough for both of them. She danced and sashayed across the stage. She seemed happy to the point of giddiness, and one wondered whether her dose of Prozac may have been a tad too high that day. One big point that the Gore campaign likes to make about Tipper, and one that Karenna Gore (their eldest daughter) made at the convention, is that she is an enfant terrible, a free spirit, albeit a harmless one, who tells reporters whatever is on her mind. Her handlers cannot control her. </p> <p>The message that is put out to the press is that no message can be put out to the press. She is just too authentic, too true to herself. The idea is that you are getting pure, uncensored access to the Gore family. The character of Tipper is meant to counteract everything you have seen or read or know about her husband's lack of spontaneity. In high school she played drums with a girl band called the Wild Cats. She painted a naked self-portrait when she was pregnant. She goes barefoot on Airforce Two. She is Gore's frolicking unselfconscious other half. The plump blonde id of the Gore campaign. </p> <p>Laura, an ex-elementary school librarian, is quintessentially unthreatening in an entirely different way. With her short, sensible hair, bright blue eyes and dowdy style, she is a vague maternal figure who somehow manages to stay vague no matter how many times she speaks or is profiled. When she stood on the podium at the Republican convention there was an absence of slickness, a lack of charisma, of heat and desire, that played well. Much was made of how nervous she was before her speech (\"I get butterflies a little bit thinking about it\") and that nervousness translated into a middle American ordinariness, a modesty that people found appealing. </p> <p>The New York Times headlined its profile of her \"Quiet Strength\", which is exactly the image the Bush campaign was trying to project. Even the \"political problems\" with Laura seem to serve a shrewd function. For instance, she doesn't agree with her husband on all of the issues, such as abortion. She loyally refuses to talk about it. But, in fact, having a wife who disagrees with him in a quiet way can't hurt a candidate seeking women's votes and trying to soften his anti-choice image without alienating his core constituency. </p> <p>And then there is, of course, the great unspoken shadow of the current first lady - the dislike that rises in her wake, and leaves the campaigns scrambling to define exactly how their candidates are not like Hillary Clinton without saying it too directly. Laura says things like: \"I don't really want to talk about the issues that much. I am not that knowledgeable about most issues.\" Tipper says things like: \"With four children and ageing parents I find that I only spend so much time on the issues that I care about, and I spend a lot of time on keeping the family together.\" In other words, we couldn't have two aspiring first ladies less interested in politics. </p> <p>Both campaigns have made quite a show of how their candidates' wives were resistant to public life. Bush recounts over and over how he promised his wife that she would never have to give a political speech before she would agree to marry him, and her friends give accounts that she would trade it all in \"for long afternoons of reading and mornings of gardening, and be utterly happy\". Meanwhile, Gore aides send out reports of how fearful Tipper was that a presidential campaign would consume her family, and how apprehensive she was about her husband's first run for congress. </p> <p>It seems important that the point is made: these are spotlight-shunning, un-power-hungry women. Not shrinking violets, either of them, but women who don't possess a single ounce of vicarious ambition. Either one of them, their campaigns seem to say, will be dragged reluctantly yet dutifully into the oval office. These are the un-Hillarys being displayed for the American public. (Though it should be pointed out that their distaste for political life seems largely theoretical: Laura is being cast by her husband's camp as an extremely reluctant campaigner, but in February alone she reluctantly campaigned in 22 different states.) </p> <p>The wives of America's current candidates are studiedly old-fashioned. Even the Democrats stress that Tipper will be a first lady \"in the traditional mould\". These women are housewives and mothers. They gave up their temporary and unpassionate careers for their husbands in an era when it was no longer common to do so. They devote themselves to their families, and have mild artistic pursuits, such as photography and painting and reading. They present a sweetly pastoral image of American womanhood that has nothing whatsoever to do with American women. Somehow, America seems to want a first lady who represents not the values of the country, but the values of the country 50 years ago. </p> <p>It is a curious pocket of sexism, a pocket of nostalgia, that represents not what women are but an old portrait of them that, some of us at least, apparently still long for: the mother who stays home; the supportive wife; the quiet strength. As if behind every powerful man is a not-so-powerful woman. So far it has worked. Laura Bush and Tipper Gore are both immensely popular. (Though the campaigns are careful not to make it seem like they are too retrograde. For instance, Laura used to refer to herself as \"shy\" and now denies it, as does everyone around her with a regularity so noticeable that the New York Times said it was \"as if they all received the same memo\".) </p> <p>Gore said in his convention speech, \"This is not a popularity contest,\" but, of course, that is exactly what it is. Today's candidates have to be liked, and known in the manner of the captain of the football team. Neither Gore nor Bush are particularly adept at giving the crucial illusion of intimacy, of making the voter feel like they know him, making the voter dream about him, the way Bill Clinton famously is. Without that gift for intimacy the voter has to be drawn into the candidate's kitchen by other means. They have to feel like they have been invited over to dinner and chatted with. To do what Clinton could do with a bite of his lip, with a throaty laugh, with a lazy smile, these candidates have to call in reserves - their pleasant, unthreatening wives.</p>",
  "John Monks, TUC general secretary, won an unexpected standing ovation from the Liberal Democrat conference yesterday after calling for immediate moves to beef up the campaign to take Britain into the euro zone. <p>\"Some of us might wish that we were in the euro already,\" he said. \"But the realpolitik is that we will have to win a referendum some time after the next election,\" after the pound \"has become far more competitive\" against the euro. </p> <p>His call for \"a people's Europe, not just a Europe for bankers, boardrooms and bureaucrats\" was matched with a warning that the campaign would not be won by conceding key Eurosceptic allegations such as excess regulation which were simply untrue. </p> <p>In the first appearance by a TUC leader on the main conference platform, Mr Monks, who was invited by Charles Kennedy, stressed how many shared aims and interests the unions and the Lib Dems had. </p> <p>He took several sideswipes at the government for not going as far as the unions or Lib Dems wanted, though aides said his olive branch to the Lib Dems did not mean he was distancing himself from Labour. </p> <p>\"The TUC both wants and has good relations with this government,\" said Mr Monks. \"We, like you, will make our criticisms, but the contrast with the previous government is all too stark.\" </p> <p>In a pointer to the coming election campaign he warned that William Hague's Toryism would remove workers' rights and push Britain towards the American social model - instead of the inclusive European one that Al Gore, the Democrats' presidential candidate, would like to move towards. </p> <p>His moderate speech, a week after the TUC conference, repeated criticism of the fuel blockades. \"You cannot expect governments to cut taxes without spelling out how you would cut spending. These were not just blockades on petrol but blockades on democracy.\"</p>",
  "At its worst for Tony Blair the four-point Tory lead on this months Guardian/ICM poll could translate if there were a general election tomorrow into a minority Conservative government kept in power by the Ulster Unionists. <p> Such a scenario will alarm and depress Labour voters almost as much as the sudden and unexpected loss of the partys eight year unbroken opinion poll lead. </p> <p> The ICM survey, which followed two other polls showing the two parties neck and neck (NOP) or the Tories ahead by two points (Mori), does indicate that the government is in significant trouble from which it may not quickly recover.</p> <p> Although Tory strategists were cheering the news as the petrol crisis provided both them and the Liberal Democrats with some much needed political momentum, detailed analysis shows there may be a crumb of comfort for Labour. </p> <p> In the early summer after William Hague's big campaigns on asylum and law and order the Tories managed to push their opinion poll rating up from 30% to 35%. But then the Tory party seemed to disappear from the news agenda as most of the shadow cabinet took a holiday.</p> <p> Now the petrol crisis has given them an added push to hit 38% not astronomic for an opposition party at this stage in the parliament but the best that Mr Hague has managed since he became leader. </p> <p>The one crumb of comfort for Tony Blair is that, as with the two weekend polls, it has been the Liberal Democrats the traditional home of the protest vote and not the Tories who have benefited most from Labours 10 point slide from 44% last month to 34% this month.</p> <p> However the psephologist Professor John Curtice, of Strathclyde University, points out that the Tories may be in a stronger position than the opinion polls suggest because in the seats that count they are outperforming the national swing. Recent local election results show they are doing better than the national polls indicate in those key seats they need to recapture from Labour at the next election. </p> <p>One reason for this is the decline in anti-Tory tactical voting by Liberal Democrat supporters as their disenchantment with the Labour government grows. </p> <p> A general election result tomorrow with the Tories on 38%, Labour on 34% and the Liberal Democrats on 22%, as indicated by this weeks Guardian/ICM poll, would be unlikely to keep a minority Labour government in power with Lib Dem support. </p> <p>Prof Curtice says. He says that the difference in the expected better performance by the Tories in terms of seats rather than a uniform opinion poll swing means that Labour would need to be three points ahead of the Conservatives to be sure of forming a majority government.</p> <p> The real question is whether these three polls at the end of the petrol crisis are a temporary blip for Mr Blair or represent a decisive shift in support based on a sudden loss of confidence which New Labour will find hard to reverse. </p> <p>So far voters have made clear they want to punish Tony Blair particularly for the petrol crisis and more generally for not being a listening government, but have not gone as far as endorsing the Conservatives as the credible alternative government. The party conference season will determine whether it will take a long or short haul for Labour to stage a recovery.</p>"
