  "An American woman, sentenced in 1996 to life in a Peruvian prison for her alleged role in a terrorist plot, took a significant step towards freedom yesterday after a military court revoked her conviction for terrorism and granted her a new civilian trial. <p>Lori Berenson has maintained her innocence since her arrest in Lima on charges of conspiring with the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) to mount an attack on Peru's congress. Under the country's draconian anti-terrorism laws, she was tried by military judges wearing balaclavas to hide their identity. Her lawyers were not permitted to cross-examine the government witnesses against her, including a former housemate who claimed to have been her lover.</p> <p>Ms Berenson, now 30, has been incarcerated in remote mountain prisons, where the high altitude and cold have taken a toll on her health and she now suffers from intermittent blindness in one eye.</p> <p>Ms Berenson's fate became a political issue in this year's controversial election campaign, when President Fujimori denounced his opponent, Alejandro Toledo, for suggesting he would review her case. The president accused Mr Toledo of being soft on terrorism and swore the American woman would never be freed.</p> <p>The Supreme Military Justice Commission gave no reason for its surprise announcement on Wednesday revoking Ms Berenson's life sentence, but diplomatic observers speculated that the decision was an attempt to improve relations with the US strained by Ms Berenson's trial and by the May elections, which US and other international observers dismissed as rigged.</p> <p>Philip Reeker, a state department spokesman, told journalists: \"Since Ms Berenson's conviction nearly five years ago, we have maintained that the trial proceedings against her did not meet due-process standards, and so we welcome the court's decision.\"</p> <p>No date has been set for a new trial and Ms Berenson's parents have expressed concern over the independence of the civilian courts, raising doubts that she would receive a fair trial. \"There is no basis in truth or law for holding Lori another day,\" her father, Mark Berenson, said.</p> <p>Ms Berenson was arrested in November 1995 in a crackdown on the MRTA by Peru's security forces. The treason charges hinged largely on the testimony of an MRTA member, Pacifico Castrellon, who claims to have been her boyfriend, but whom she has described as only a housemate. Her lawyers claim he agreed to implicate her in the hope of mitigating his own sentence.</p> <p>At the time of Ms Berenson's arrest, the MRTA was a fairly minor rebel group which had carried out a string of kidnappings and killings. A year after she was imprisoned, the movement rose to worldwide notoriety with its seizure of the Japanese ambassador's residence, leading eventually to its storming by government troops in April 1997.</p> <p>The police say they found seven automatic rifles in the house Ms Berenson shared with Mr Castrellon, together with 8,000 rounds of ammunition, 100 hand grenades and more than 2,000 sticks of dynamite. Ms Berenson claimed to have no knowledge of how the weapons came to be there.</p>",
  "<p>Internet company <strong> Freeserve </strong> 's shares continued to decline yesterday, down a further 17.5p to 252p as traders continued to bet on the company's likely ejection from the FTSE 100 when the constituents' committee meets next week. </p> <p> <strong> Dixons </strong> , which owns 80% of Freeserve, also saw their share price drop slightly, down 1.25p, closing at 236.75p. </p> <p>At the same time, it is expected that steel manufacturer <strong> Corus </strong> and aircraft engine maker <strong> Rolls-Royce </strong> will also be relegated in the quarterly shake up. </p> <p>Corus' share price remained fairly constant, down 0.75p, closing at 66.75p, but Rolls-Royce managed an advance of 10.5p - or 6% - to 185.5p. This followed reports that the company has won an order worth as much as $910m (\u00a3625m) from International Lease Financial Corporation. </p> <p>One analyst said yesterday that Freeserve's declining share price could be due to people giving it a \"good kicking\", because of fears of relegation. </p> <p>The falling price could also indicate that tracker funds - funds which mirror the Footsie and other indicies - are already avoiding Freeserve, ahead of the reshuffle. </p> <p> <strong> Marks &amp; Spencer </strong> dropped to its lowest level in 10 years yesterday following reports that sales at Britain's largest clothing retailer are still tumbling. The share price dipped 1p to 208p. </p> <p>The leading pharmaceutical companies were also under pressure. <strong> Glaxo Wellcome </strong> fell 62p to 1958p, and its merger partner <strong> Smithkline Beecham</strong> closed at 888p down 21p, while <strong> AstraZeneca </strong> fell 67p to 3093p. </p> <p>Dealers pointed to some heavy profit taking amongst drug stocks in the United States, where the sector was down by about 1% during London trading time. </p> <p>But there was also a political element to the selling, with presidential hopeful Al Gore attacking drug company profits and proposing to expand Medicare benefits - the government programme that pro vides health care coverage for Americans in their old age. </p> <p>Under a prescription drug proposal from Mr Gore, Medicare would cover the entire cost of prescription drugs for senior citizens with incomes of less than about $15,000 a year per couple. </p> <p>Mining stocks were also weak with <strong> Billiton </strong> falling 10%, or 30p to 270p after its spending spree in Canada. </p> <p> <strong> Tate &amp; Lyle </strong> fell 10.5p to 268p and <strong> Safeway </strong> was down 5.25p to close at 265.5p. </p> <p>Analysts pointed out that it was not a good day for most old-economy firms. But the market generally was quite firm, led by the big oil firms such as <strong> Shell </strong> , as the price of crude ticked over $31 a barrel. </p> <p>Shell itself rose 12.5p to 600p, leading gains in the sector, while <strong> BP </strong> advanced 6p to 640.5p. </p> <p>Tech stocks were also having a good day, with a few momentum investors said to be active on the other side of the Atlantic, pushing the Nasdaq market higher. </p> <p>Software group <strong> Sema </strong> closed at \u00a312.21 up 71p, while chip designer <strong> ARM Holdings</strong> gained 35.5p to 807.5p, while <strong> Logica </strong> registered a 59p advance to \u00a319.29. </p> <p>The net effect was a 22.6 point advance by the FTSE 100 index to 6,586.3, while the Techmark 100 jumped 80.8 points to 3,816.2. </p> <p>Among the few remaining regional brewers, <strong> Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley </strong> rose 25.5p to 515p following reports that Robert Breare and backers Botts &amp; Co and Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette plan to raise their \u00a3472m offer for the brewer of Pedigree, Bank's and Speckled Hen beers. </p> <p>Shares in the stores group <strong> Budgens</strong> rose 8.5p to 79p, after Ireland's largest food distributor, Musgrave, spent \u00a389m buying a near-controlling stake in the company. </p> <p>However, the rise in the share price still gives Budgens a market value of just \u00a3135m, compared with the \u00a3200m tag implied by the pricing of the Irish deal.</p>",
  "The growing mountain of freshly-made pupils' desks and teachers' tables stacked haphazardly outside Joao Evangelino's rudimentary carpentry workshop in the town of Maliana neatly encapsulates the current state of East Timor, one year after it voted overwhelmingly for independence from Indonesia. <p>It is undeniable evidence that reconstruction in this United Nations-run territory, which was systematically destroyed by the Indonesian army and its local militias following the referendum last August 30, is at last gathering momentum and allowing the East Timorese the chance to participate in their own nation-building. But the fact that it is there at all, starting to gather dust, is undeniable evidence that there is still a long way to go before this former Portuguese colony can claim to have completed its phoenix-like rise from the ashes of last year's devastation. Just last night, UN troops and militias exchanged gunfire near Maliana. </p> <p>\"The UN says it has nowhere to put it,\" said Mr Evangelino, gesturing towards the furniture. \"They haven't decided which schools are going to reopen, let alone rebuilt them. And the school holiday ends next month.\" </p> <p>That Mr Evangelino endured a tortuous ordeal to see his workshop become a reality is a further microcosm of the nation's acute growing pains. </p> <p>\"I put in my proposal on January 1 and got the money on May 30th,\" said the mini-entrepreneur who, like thousands of East Timorese, spent weeks hiding from the militia until the UN established a presence in October. \"I was told little except that the process takes a long time and that I had to be patient.\" </p> <p>UN officials accept that reconstruction has been slow but blame the delays on factors beyond their control. \"The situation in East Timor was exceptional,\" explained the UN's transitional administrator, Sergio Vieria de Mello. \"Unlike when we arrived in Kosovo, there was nothing here. Everything had either been destroyed or stolen. We had to start from scratch.\" </p> <p>That was undoubtedly the case, but the army of foreign administrators, donors and developers went about reconstruction in the wrong way. The most prominent first signs of change visible on the streets of the capital Dili were a fleet of thousands of brand-new four-wheel-drive vehicles, a 500-room floating hotel shipped in from Singapore for the international staff, and the growing number of cafes catering to their cappuccino craving. </p> <p>These visible manifestations of the new neo-colonialism might not have been so bad if there had been decent interaction with the locals, many of whom had lost literally everything. But, for the most part, the foreigners were taught practically nothing about East Timor before arriving and when they landed they received little guidance from their superiors. </p> <p>\"I did not arrive in East Timor with a full knowledge of the situation here or the psychology of the East Timorese,\" Mr Vieira de Mello admitted. \"It took me six months to understand.\" </p> <p>As if afraid to learn or take any initiative, many UN staff drove round from meeting to meeting with their windows up, appearing not to acknowledge the destitution and suffering around them. \"After work people would not go out and speak to the East Timorese, to find out what they wanted,\" one UN staffer said. \"They went and checked their email.\" </p> <p>Compounding the problems were the over-optimistic expectations of the East Timorese. \"There was a widespread feeling that we were going to come in and solve their problems overnight,\" said Gianni Deligia, the UN district administrator in Maliana. \"The reality is that we are more a like a supermarket. We have this and that on offer and they have to choose.\" </p> <p>Crisis point came at the end of April. Demonstrations outside the headquarters of the UN Transitional Administration in East Timor (Untaet) were a daily part of life in Dili. To the East Timorese it seemed as if there was lots of show but little substance. Not atypical, according to one aid worker, was an education project where \"only 18% of the budget went on pens, paper and stuff for the kids. There was so much bureaucratic waste.\" </p> <p><b> Frustration</b><br> </p> <p> Local leaders are more blunt. \"There was a sense of frustration, a lack of faith in Untaet,\" said Jose Ramos Horta, a vice president of the East Timorese political umbrella group, the National Council of East Timorese Resistance (CNRT), and a Nobel Peace Prize winner. \"[This was] because of their inability to involve the East Timorese, their inability to come forward with a roadmap, a plan. We saw time going by and no Timorese administration, no civil servants being recruited, no jobs being created.\" </p> <p>So in May Mr Horta and the CNRT president, Jose Alexandre \"Xanana\" Gusmao, \"did a lot of shock therapy with the UN\", Mr Horta says, and within days a difference was noticeable. In June four of the eight cabinet posts in the transitional administration were given to East Timorese and the size of the local consultation council was doubled. \"Now we are in a much more cordial, fruitful partnership between the UN and CNRT,\" Mr Horta said. \"There are less demonstrations, people are getting jobs and also enough to eat.\" </p> <p>There is also a roadmap of the path towards transition to full independence. The CNRT is currently holding its first proper congress where the goal is to empower the constituent political parties, both those that existed before Jakarta invaded in 1975 and the new ones. The first general election is timetabled for the second half of next year. </p> <p>Of much greater concern are the faltering processes of reconstruction and developing a sustainable economy. The World Bank, in charge of stimulating small and medium-sized enterprises, \"has never worked quicker in its existence since the second world war than it has here,\" according to its spokesman in Dili, Malcolm Ehrenpries. But, he adds, there are numerous hurdles still to overcome before a proper development strategy can be implemented. \"We do not even know how many people live in East Timor.\" </p> <p>The population was about 800,000 before the vote. But a proportion of these were Indonesians who left and more than 250,000 people fled or were forced into West Timor by the militias. Well over 100,000 are thought still to be in virtual imprisonment in refugee camps there. </p> <p>Coffee is the only current significant foreign currency earner - to the tune of about \u00a312m last year - although East Timor and Australia are exploring the sea between them for oil and natural gas. No one knows for certain how big a windfall might come East Timor's way; people are hoping for billions but the most realistic estimates are in the range of tens of millions of dollars a year. </p> <p>The lack of income-generating opportunities is reflected in the national budget which, for the sake of not wanting to create a massive debt burden, has been limited to a paltry $60m. </p> <p>\"We can't yet see if the economy will ever be really sustainable,\" said Arsenio Barno, the executive director of the East Timor Non-Governmental Organisation Forum. \"We're concentrating on developing the capacity of our human resources but our worry is that we will end up like Cambodia. Seven years after the UN went in the country is still very dependent on foreign aid.\" </p> <p>The struggle to create a functioning judicial system is typical of East Timor's human resources crisis, according to Mr Vieira de Mello. \"What we had here were Timorese students with law degrees from Indonesian universities, none of whom had the slightest court experience,\" he said. \"Well, we appointed them, we trained them and if you visit the Dili court you will see that we now have a credible, independent Timorese judiciary.\" </p> <p>What Mr Vieira de Mello did not say was that while the system might be functioning it is unable to cope with the flood of work and, like all facets of the embryonic administration, will take years to develop enough strength in depth. </p> <p>With the future not looking exactly rosy, most people are putting their faith in Mr Gusmao. This former resistance leader who spent seven years in Indonesian jails is by far the most popular man in the territory and is widely expected to become the first president of independent East Timor. </p> <p>\"I don't see any serious alternative candidate to Xanana becoming president,\" Mr Horta says. \"Just like with Mandela, he is an exceptional individual that everybody just follows.\" </p> <p>But Mr Gusmao is not exactly brimming with confidence about East Timor's prospects. \"It's difficult to rebuild this country,\" he said. \"We're building anew and need a new mentality to go with it. I can't tell you my priority because everything is still a priority.\"</p>",
  "Bill Clinton's globetrotting schedule this week is beginning to read like one of those \"If it's Tuesday, it must be Paris\" whistle-stop American tours of the world that Europeans like to mock so much. And just as you can't do the Louvre in a morning, so Clinton is learning the hard way that you can't expect to fly in and cast a magic wand over the deep-seated problems of centuries. <p>The American president's international schedule has become increasingly absurd and demeaning. Since this is Wednesday, then today it is Colombia, where Clinton is jetting in this morning for a mere one-day visit - also the first of his presidency - to a country impaled on one of Latin America's most intractable civil wars. </p> <p>Clinton paused last night at the White House long enough to collect a clean shirt, but it was the end of a day which started several time zones away. Yesterday morning Clinton was in Egypt, where he tried in the space of a few hours to lever the Middle East peace talks into fresh life in talks with President Mubarak. </p> <p>On Monday he was in yet another cultural zone, thousands of miles south in Tanzania - another debut Clinton visit lasting less than 24 hours - where he sought unavailingly to place his benediction on Nelson Mandela's long and winding efforts to broker a peace deal in Burundi. Over last weekend, Clinton was in Nigeria - for a full two-and-a-half days this time - where he attempted to lend American lustre, but not much else, to that country's tentative and troubled efforts to cope with everything from Aids to international debt. </p> <p>If it is true - and it is - that Al Gore wants his boss to keep off the American political stage for the duration of the current presidential election campaign, then Clinton is obliging in some style, as well as racking up enough air miles to qualify for a free round trip in Air Force One to the Olympic Games in Sydney. But this is far from being the end of it. There is still persistent talk in Washington of one last visit to Northern Ireland, and even of another journey to the Middle East before the removal van finally calls at the White House on January 20. </p> <p>Clinton's frenetic foreign schedule is not hard to explain. Like the Flying Dutchman, who was doomed to travel the seven seas, Clinton is in search of redemption. His administration is desperate - the word is well advised - to confect some sort of international triumph which can be paraded for posterity as Clinton's \"legacy\". He is prepared to fly anywhere to be acclaimed as a peacemaker or a statesman, and to avoid being remembered as the only elected president to be impeached. </p> <p>As Clinton's eight years in office narrow to their final few months, the search for an international signing ceremony somewhere, anywhere, has become almost pathetic. But the more he tries, the less seriously it has been taken. Vladimir Putin brushed him off in Moscow in June over missile defence. Yasser Arafat rejected his blandishments at Camp David in July. Now we have what is in some ways the most striking sight of all, in Arusha this week, of even the leaders of benighted Burundi turning their backs on the supposedly indispensable leader of the world. </p> <p> It is tempting, but wrong, to put all of this down to Clinton himself, though that will not stop the Clinton-haters of both the left and the right from doing just that. What it does show, however, is that not all of the world's problems are to be settled by Clintonian charm and compromise, or in the Panglossian spirit of \"what's good for one is also good for all\", that is such a hallmark of the Clintonian globalisers' world view. In the Middle East, in Burundi, in Russia, in Colombia and even in Northern Ireland, the stubborn realities of history and of power have not disappeared after all. </p> <p>The two men who seek to follow Clinton recognise this in their different ways. Recoiling from what John McCain calls \"photo op foreign policy\", both Gore and George W Bush are looking to pull up the drawbridge and ration their appearances on the world stage much more than Clinton has been able to do - though it is worth remembering that Clinton himself started out with that intention too. </p> <p>But America's indecision is also the world's indecision. As Clinton makes his latest day trip to a major country, we see the limits of American indispensability. But when the next ethnic cleansing, the next military coup, the next civil war - even the next talks impasse - breaks out, to whom will we turn but to America? </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martin.kettle@theguardian.com\">martin.kettle@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "President Clinton arrives in Colombia today amid tight security for a visit that will underline a deepening US commitment to a messy civil war involving government forces, paramilitary death squads, leftist rebels and 90% of the world's cocaine. <p>In the first trip to the country by a US president in a decade, Mr Clinton will throw his weight behind Plan Colombia, an ambitious strategy which the Colombian government hopes will put an end to the drugs trade and bring peace after nearly 40 years of fighting. </p> <p>Visiting the capital, Bogota, was deemed too risky, so Mr Clinton will meet the Colombian president, Andres Pastrana, in the resort of Cartagena, on the Caribbean coast, guarded by 5,000 Colombian troops and 350 US agents. </p> <p>\"Colombia's success is profoundly in the interest of the United States a peaceful, democratic and economically prosperous Colombia will help promote democracy and stability throughout the hemisphere,\" Mr Clinton said earlier this month. </p> <p>Acknowledging both Colombia's strategic importance and its growing instability, Mr Clinton has supported Plan Colombia from its inception, and pledged $1.3bn (\u00a3867m) towards the scheme. But critics of the aid package fear the money will only cause the fighting to escalate, and may even spread political and drug-related violence throughout the region. </p> <p><b> Human rights</b><br> </p> <p> While some US aid will go to development programmes and an overhaul of Colombia's legal system, most will be spent on equipment and training for security forces, despite persistent concerns over the military's human rights record. </p> <p>Monitoring groups regularly accuse the Colombian army of standing by while rightwing paramilitaries massacre unarmed civilians they accuse of helping leftist rebels. </p> <p>Last week Mr Clinton waived strict human rights conditions imposed by Congress and authorised the aid package, arguing that Colombia's situation was a matter of US national security. But a White House memorandum justifying the decision acknowledged that \"there remain disturbing, credible allegations that individual Colombian military officers continue to collaborate with paramilitaries\". </p> <p>The waiver provoked criticism from human rights groups. \"It gives a clear message that from the US point of view, human rights are not important. What matters for them is the war on drugs,\" said Jorge Rojas of the Consultancy for Human Rights and Displacement, a Bogota-based monitoring group. </p> <p>There are signs that US aid has already led to an escalation of Colombia's civil war. In March, the country's largest guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) said it would step up kidnappings for ransom in order to raise funds equal to the US military aid. </p> <p>The guerrillas have also increased their attacks against isolated police stations, part of a long-term strategy to strengthen their control of rural Colombia. Although they have been involved in peace talks since last year, no ceasefire has been signed and, since January, the rebels have attacked 50 such stations. Sixty officers and dozens of civilians have been killed. </p> <p>\"Farc is accelerating its plans for territorial control, but the guerrillas are not the only ones getting stronger. State forces are improving, as are the paramilitaries. Inevitably there will be an escalation,\" said defence analyst Alfredo Rangel. </p> <p>In early August, 83 US Green Berets arrived in the country to train the second of three counter-narcotics battalions con templated in Plan Colombia. These units will lead a campaign into the rebel-dominated southern jungles of Colombia, where most of the world's cocaine is made. </p> <p>\"Our aid is strictly limited to anti-narcotics activities. It is not directed towards supporting counter-insurgent operations,\" Mr Clinton told the Colombian magazine Cambio this week. But Colombian military commanders recognise that a push in the region will inevitably bring troops into combat with several thousand Farc guerrillas who protect drug installations in return for \"war taxes\". </p> <p><b> Attack</b><br> </p> <p> \"We will attack anyone in the drugs trade - Farc, paramilitaries or whoever,\" said General Mario Montoya, commander of the army's southern task force. </p> <p>It is still unclear how a military strike against drug plantations will tally with the second component of Plan Colombia: a package of social development to help wean locals from growing drug crops. </p> <p>According to Mr Pastrana, investment in education, infrastructure and services will play a key part in establishing the rule of law in the southern regions of Putumayo and Caqueta. Traditionally, Colombian governments have paid little attention to these remote Amazon regions, allowing both rebel columns and drug plantations to grow unchecked. </p> <p>In the past, Colombia has focused on spending \"to prevent drugs reaching the streets of the US, instead of investing in education, sewage systems, housing\", said Mr Pastrana. \"We want to work hand in hand with the communities, instead of concentrating on the policing aspect\". </p> <p>But funding for social development programmes remains in doubt. At a conference in Madrid last month, European countries failed to pledge the $1bn (\u00a3667m) Mr Pastrana had hoped for. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Farc is reported to be giving weapons training to peasants in Putumayo, and refugee groups fear that up to 200,000 people will flee their homes if widespread fighting breaks out. </p> <p>Neighbouring countries have expressed concern that the plan may cause Colombia's civil war to spill across its borders. Ecuador and Brazil have reinforced security along their jungle frontiers. Peru's president, Alberto Fujimori, said last week that an anti-narcotics drive could threaten the stability of the entire region. </p> <p>\"How can you strengthen democracy in the midst of a war?\" said Mr Rojas. His organisation and 36 more Colombian human rights, Indian and development groups have said they will not participate in projects funded under the plan. </p> <p>Farc chiefs say Mr Clinton's approval of Plan Colombia was timed to coincide with the US election campaign. Speaking from a stronghold in southern Colombia, Commander Andres Paris said: \"They want to spill Colombian blood to help their presidential candidates.\" </p> <p> <b>50 years of Conflict</b></p> <p><b> 948</b> Assassination of popular liberal politician leads to rural unrest which claims 300,000 lives over next decade </p> <p><b> 1953-57</b> Military seize power, before returning it to coalition rule by liberal and conservative parties </p> <p><b> 1964</b> Colombian military launch US-backed Operation Laso, to destroy leftist guerrillas.

  "America's longest-serving federal judge, David Edelstein, has died at the age of 90, still actively presiding over one of the Justice Department's most contentious cases - its 12-year battle to prise the Teamsters union from the hands of organised crime. <p>Earlier in his long career, the judge had set something of a world record, spending 43 years adjudicating the government's mammoth anti-trust case against IBM (the most important such action until the case against Microsoft). </p> <p>Edelstein's increasingly short fuse during the endless hearings with IBM eventually provoked the company to successfully seek his removal from the case in 1995. In its judgment, the appellate court upheld the company's complaint, ruling that it was \"manifestly clear that a reasonable observer would question the judge's impartiality\". </p> <p>The most recent example of Edelstein's robust judicial style came on June 16 this year when he was presented with the Teamsters' proposed new rules for next year's leadership elections. The government had already accepted them as sufficiently stringent to stop the widespread corruption that has characterised the union's voting for decades. </p> <p>But Judge Edelstein would have none of it. \"The submissions are a farrago of ill advice and misguided, inept, controversial and confused argots,\" he declared. \"Their programme has the potential of bringing grief, strife, controversy and corruption.\" </p> <p>He was well accustomed to controversy, which had hit him from the moment President Truman nominated him for the federal bench in 1951. Though his family was comfortably off, Edelstein had to pay his own way through college as a stock exchange page boy (where he witnessed the 1929 market crash first hand). After a period of private practice, until after the war, he eventually opted for a steady income and began climbing the department of justice ladder as attorney for various federal government departments. </p> <p>He was not Truman's first choice when a vacancy arose on the New York federal bench, and his nomination was strongly opposed by three separate bar associations. They were concerned about his lack of trial experience, but Truman's presidency was coming to a close and, amid the election fever which brought the Republican Dwight Eisenhower to the White House, the Senate confirmed Edelstein's appointment. </p> <p>The case against IBM came to his court almost as soon as he took his seat in 1952. After four years of argument, the company formally agreed to modify its business practices. However, as is usual in such cases, the details proved endlessly complicated and contentious. Time and again, year after year, IBM was brought back to court for alleged breaches of its undertakings. The paperwork eventually reached millions of pages, but Edelstein refused to let the Justice Department withdraw the case. Finally, to everyone's relief, the appeal court's ruling against him brought in another judge. </p> <p>While the IBM case was still on his calendar, Edelstein was also assigned to the government's action against the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which controls much of the nation's road transport and was notorious for being in the hands of the mafia. The federal government had been trying to take effective action since the union was expelled from the main trade union federation in 1958. President Eisenhower brought in special legislation in 1959, but the mysterious disappearance (and presumed murder) of the Teamsters's president, Jimmy Hoffa, in 1975 showed that little had changed. </p> <p>The finding by a 1986 presidential commission that the union had been \"firmly under the control of organised crime since the 1950s\" finally brought charges in June 1988 under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act (RICO), an extremely wide-ranging law which even mafia lawyers have found difficult to circumvent. Faced with such drastic measures, the union surrendered unconditionally within months, and Judge Edelstein was appointed to supervise its electoral affairs until satisfied they were in order. </p> <p>Though initially there were significant improvements, further problems soon came to Edelstein's courtroom, including allegations of gerrymandering, corruption, and embezzlement. Once again the hearings in the case went on for years. Eventually, the judge approved the removal of the union's president (which brought Jimmy Hoffa's son James to the post) and, as his last contribution to this long-running drama, finally accepted the union's revised electoral rules. </p> <p>The Teamsters case had only come before Edelstein because he had flatly refused to retire in 1980 when he reached the customary age of 70. He knew, of course, that Article III of the constitution stipulates that federal judges \"shall hold their offices during good behaviour\" - in other words, for life. If that was the express wish of the founding fathers, Edelstein apparently reasoned, who was he to argue? </p> <p>He is survived by his wife Florence and their two sons. </p> <p><b> David Norton Edelstein, jurist, born February 16 1910; died August 19 2000 </b></p>",
  "Bill Clinton's daughter Chelsea is planning to follow in her father's footsteps by doing a postgraduate course at Oxford University, according to American journalist Larry King. <p>In his USA Today column the television interviewer said Ms Clinton, 20, told him she hoped to go to Oxford \"in fall 2001\", and was interested in \"politics, government and history\". </p> <p>Ms Clinton is currently studying history at Stanford University in California where she is due to graduate by the spring. It is not known whether Ms Clinton has made any formal application to join the university. </p> <p>Her father spent two years at University College as a Rhodes scholar in the late sixties where his broader education included smoking marijuana. He famously insisted that he \"didn't inhale\". </p> <p>He is believed to have been ostracised by some British students who held a snobbish attitude towards their American contemporaries. He returned to the city in 1994 and received an honorary degree from Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, chancellor of Oxford. </p> <p>Ms Clinton is currently on a break from studies to help her mother Hillary who is standing in the election to become the senator for New York. </p> <p>She has previously spoken of her desire to become a doctor but has now dropped science courses in favour of history. </p> <p>The speculation follows reports earlier this year that President Clinton was interested in returning to the university to teach and had also expressed an interest in moving to Glympton, 12 miles outside Oxford. A move to Britain by either would involve a major security operation. </p> <p>After his daughter's decision to take this semester off, the president said: \"She wants to be able to help her mother and she wants to be able to keep company with her father. Hillary and I are immensely gratified by that. It's been a great comfort to Hillary and me to have her around more.\"</p>"
