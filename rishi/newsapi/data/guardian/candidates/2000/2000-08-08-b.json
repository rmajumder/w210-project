  "<p>In that boisterous, artfully crusty way of his, Sir Robin Day would have chuckled to hear that his death was the lead item on the Six O'Clock News on Radio 4 and on many television news bulletins last night. </p> <p>\"It must be a slow news day,\" he would have muttered, and he would have been correct. A consummate news junkie, devouring newsprint, books, magazines and TV for nearly 50 professional years, he knew all too well how his trade worked. </p> <p>Despite his fame, he was a modest man who felt he had not achieved all that he might have. </p> <p>At least in part, the key may lie in a half-forgotten detail of his long career. In the general election of 1959 he stood for parliament in the Liberal interest at Hereford. In Harold Macmillan's 100-seat landslide he was beaten, by 17,763 votes to 10,185, by an Etonian farmer, David Gibson-Watt. </p> <p>In a long career Mr Gibson-Watt did not unduly draw attention to himself. Day, already well-known as \"a television news commentator and journalist\" (his description in the 1959 Times election guide), went on to become a household name, first at Panorama, later in his decade as the incomparable host of BBC TV's Question Time - a \"stop-gap\" programme which grabbed 7m viewers. </p> <p>And yet he would tell friends in his old age that he would have traded the lot to be \"the humblest of backbenchers\". He spent a lot of time in the Commons press gallery, more than modern Paxmans would do. It was another reason why politicians saw him as one of their own, despite the frequent on-camera rows. </p> <p>His romanticism may also explain the extrovert's bow tie, the booming voice, the bufferish exterior which, as with other shy men, covered inner insecurities and made them an asset. Within three years of joining ITN he was interviewing the likes of Egypt's Colonel Nasser and - a television first - grilling prime minister Harold Macmillan in 1958. </p> <p><strong> Growing up</strong><br> </p> <p> In fact Day symbolised the growing up of British television journalism, as countless colleagues and victims, including Margaret Thatcher and John Humphrys, acknowledged last night. ITN got off its knees with politicians and forced the BBC to follow suit. </p> <p>David Dimbleby, one of Day's successors at Panorama, just as Dimbleby's father, Richard, had preceded Day, said last night that Day combined \"a barrister's training, a theatrical instinct and an absolute belief in the right to know\". That is exactly right. </p> <p>Like Winston Churchill he realised early on the value of the trademark bow tie. In the ultimate thespian tribute, he was invited to appear with Des O'Connor and with Morecambe and Wise, all of whom he admired. </p> <p>Yet this was a deeply serious man who, in his autobiography, Grand Inquisitor, wrote that \"a television interview with a prime minister should be a constructive contribution to the democratic process, a dialogue which will clarify and illuminate\". </p> <p>That sounds less fun than it usually was. Day was magisterial (he did his homework very thoroughly) but he was also fun. \"Why should a man of your social position, charm and personality have to go to whores for sex,\" he asked Lord Lampton after the junior minister in Edward Heath's government was found to have bedded two prostitutes at once. Such questions were not asked on TV in the early 1970s, nor answered. Yet Lampton (wearing dark glasses) replied that most men would jump at the chance. </p> <p>One of Day's raised eyebrows or his lawyer's putdown remark was often enough to deflate most evasive ministers, as last night's celebrated clip of John Nott's walkout from a studio recalled. </p> <p>Why should viewers not believe a serving naval officer about defence cuts rather than \"a transient, here today and - if I may say so - gone tomorrow politician\", Day asked. As Nott, then defence secretary, swept out, Day could be heard saying: \"Thank you, Mr Nott.\" </p> <p>Politicians knew that he was box office. They liked and respected him, though in 1987 Mrs Thatcher put him in his place by referring to Sir Robin throughout as \"Mr Day\". He could hand it out and, rather rarer, could take it too. </p> <p>Once when he asked Mrs Thatcher whether she intended to sack some ministers, she replied: \"You are going further than I wish to go.\" \"Well naturally, that's part of my job, prime minister,\" he replied. \"Yes indeed, it's part of my job to try to stop you,\" she countered. </p> <p>He could be charming to younger colleagues, though not always. \"What did you think?\" he asked one after a big interview. When the man said the subject appeared to say nothing new, Day retorted: \"Not the answers, you fool, the questions.\" </p> <p>With hindsight, the tragedy of his later life was the BBC's decision to replace him with a younger man, Peter Sissons, on Question Time in 1989 when Day was 66 and had a lot of mileage left in him. It was a mistake on both sides. He had already applied unsuccessfully to be the director-general of the BBC in 1976, the old hankering to be a man of action. He had made less money than he thought (\"I now know capital is freedom, high income is slavery,\" he confessed) and had time on his hands. It seemed clear he was sometimes lonely. </p> <p>He lived alone in a flat near the Commons and usually lunched on the lawyers' table at his beloved Garrick Club, 10 minutes away in a taxi. William Rees-Mogg, the ex-editor of the Times, was a chum; so was Sir Stephen Tumin, the ex-chief inspector of prisons, once master of St Edmund Hall, Day's old Oxford college. </p> <p>He kept up with the law and read political biography avidly. Day grew more conservative as he grew older and, like most people in most professions, frequently expressed the view that television, and politics, were going to the dogs. By his exacting standards he was right about that, too. </p> <p> <strong>A Day in the life</strong><br></p> <p><strong> Born:</strong> 24 October 1923 </p> <p><strong> Education:</strong> read law at St Edmund Hall, Oxford University 1947-51; president of the Oxford union in 1950. </p> <p><strong> Career:</strong> called to Bar in 1952 but resigned after a year.

  "Just before lunch today, near the Tuscan hill town of San Gimignano, a ritual took place. The prime minister and his family left their 50-room villa and sat in the courtyard in front of the British press. Photographs were taken. Then the family walked back. The event is artificial but shows that in one thing at least Tony Blair is true to himself. He may have borrowed his policies from John Major via the Daily Mail and his campaign techniques from Bill Clinton, but no one can accuse the prime minister of populism in his choice of holiday. <p>Dick Morris, Bill Clinton's pollster, once asked focus groups where the president should go on vacation. Target Democrat voters, he learned, liked family values and outdoor sports and as a result Morris sent the president and his daughter Chelsea on a camping trip in the Rockies. He banned golf (too Republican) and the east coast (too old Democrat). Clinton's poll ratings fell for the first and only time during his presidential vacations.</p> <p>One can imagine the memos in bins outside Philip Gould's house if Tony Blair had asked for similar advice. \"'Prime ministerial holiday - strategy'. Tuscany has become a badly-tainted brand. Recommend TB visits Ibiza for youth appeal plus outing (with colliery band??) to Blackpool/Margate to reassure core support.\"</p> <p>Shortly before the election, Tony Blair tried this, taking Cherie off to Butlins (they rented a County Suite at \u00a3146 a week and enjoyed pole-jousting, bingo, darts and pedalo-riding) but they left for Tuscany soon after and did not return, despite suggestions that the children preferred Butlins. Presumably Euan Blair was made to drink extra-virgin olive oil until he recanted.</p> <p>This summer, as he did last year, the prime minister is borrowing a palazzo on the Tuscan estate of Prince Girolamo Strozzi. No danger of populism there. Then he will move on to stay with lawyer friends in Gascony, south-west France. That's a bit closer to the British norm - but unlike the rest of us he will be flying on one of the Queen's jets. In Italy he will be protected by 100 guards, generously loaned by the Italian prime minister.</p> <p>All this has upset the royal family, who think that they hold the monopoly on indulgent holidays beyond the reach of their subjects. An unnamed royal aide muttered: \"We find it extraordinary that while senior royals have pulled in their horns to save public money, Mr Blair can take his family around Europe in this extravagant manner.\" Expect to see the Queen at Gatwick in the 5.30am queue for charter flights to Florida, then. </p> <p>The Tories - predictably - and the media - inevitably - have joined the whinging; the Conservatives pointing out that the PM is only using the Queen's natty BAe146 jet because (in theory) he is on a working visit abroad, available for lunch under the olive trees with any passing world leader. </p> <p>This is an old ruse used by most previous prime ministers and no doubt if Hague ever does win an election we'll see the royal jet carry him and Ffion on an 'urgent official visit' to some hardy, outdoor US state. Admittedly the Blairs have stretched the limits - once slotting in a half-day meeting in South Africa to justify a return flight from London to the Seychelles - but we ought really to be cheered that the country is being run by someone who's relaxed enough to take time off.</p> <p>Margaret Thatcher's scariest trait was her desire to work every hour of the 11 years she was in charge. She had to be coaxed into taking a break, usually to scuttle back to Downing Street delighted by the arrival of a crisis. John Major was once dragged back from the Barcelona Olympics to nurse sterling from death's door. He was quite genuine in his delight on 2 May, 1997 that he would, at last, find time to watch some cricket.</p> <p>This prime minister, in contrast, has made a speciality of peppering his trips abroad with surprises, saving a man from drowning on one trip and conceiving little Leo on another. </p> <p>It is a fair bet that his ratings will rise this summer: the Tuscany effect, one might call it. He'll come back fitter, less frazzled and ready to slog his way through to the next election. He might even put an end to the silly panic which has seized the government in the past month. That can only be a good thing. And if he has to stay in a prince's palace to achieve it - well, it's none of our business.</p>",
  "<p>The new Richard Gere-Winona Ryder film is rumoured to be so bad that it's being kept from the critics before its release in the US this Friday.</p> <p>MGM's unusual move of having no press screenings before the release of <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0174480\">Autumn in New York</a> has left the film's director and two stars feeling quite uneasy, reports <a href=\"http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/eo/20000807/en/is_quot_autumn_quot_preparing_for_a_nasty_fall__7.html\">Yahoo.com</a>. </p> <p>Although the studio will not officially comment on the decision, it has hinted that the reason for withholding the film is to keep the ending a surprise. However, the general theory in these situations is that keeping critics from a film will delay any negative publicity until after the all-important debut weekend at the box office. </p> <p>The film features <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Gere,+Richard\">Gere</a> (pictured) as a famous chef who ends up falling head over heels for <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Ryder,+Winona\">Ryder</a>'s character. Gere told USA Today, \"Winona and I are very proud of this film and disagree with the decision not to preview it.\" Ryder's publicist added: \" I don't understand this decision, and I hope they change their minds.\" </p> <p>Director <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Chen,+Joan\">Joan Chen</a> also called MGM's move \"unfortunate\" and added: \"Richard and Winona give amazing performances. They are great actors, and I loved working with them.\"</p> <p>Although the suggestion is that this particular strategy may have been used because the film works better when audiences don't know what's going to happen, the film's trailers and advertisements, shown regularly on TV and in cinemas, more or less give the plot away with soundbites involving Ryder's character and some sort of life-threatening disease. </p> <p>American film writer Chris Gore, though, is not fooled: \"There's only one reason why a studio doesn't pre-screen a film for critics, and that's because the movie sucks There is no other reason. I don't think I know any other human on the planet who hasn't cringed when they've seen that trailer.\"</p>",
  "The regime of Yugoslav president and indicted war criminal, Slobodan Milosevic, upped the ante today in its war of nerves with the west, moving to charge two off-duty British policemen and two Canadians with terrorism and transferring them to Belgrade for a possible show trial. <p>The two Britons, Det Sgt Adrian Prangnell and PC John Yore, were picked up last week inside Montenegro, close to its border with Kosovo, by Yugoslav federal troops when they were returning from a holiday break on the Montenegrin coast.</p> <p>Although British diplomats have so far been denied access to the pair, their lawyer said that they may face four counts including attempted terrorism and violating Yugoslav sovereign territory.</p> <p>The two men are on secondment to the organisation for security and cooperation in Europe, helping with police training in UN-administered, Nato-controlled Kosovo. The Foreign Office dismissed the Serbian charges on Monday as \"paranoid\" while the men's relatives have described the accusations as ridiculous.</p> <p>While there seems to be no doubt about the men's innocence, this may not spare them from a long and arduous ordeal. Their misfortune is to have been caught up in a new wave of anti-western agitation launched by Mr Milosevic in the run-up to snap federal presidential elections due on September 24.</p> <p>As so often in the past, the policemen and the two Canadian civilians (like four Dutch nationals arrested in similar circumstances three weeks ago) have become virtual hostages as Mr Milosevic, using the state-controlled media, attempts to persuade Serbs that they are once again under assault from the western nations that failed to oust him during last year's Kosovo war.</p> <p>Mr Milosevic is not especially popular among the population of Serbia, but the west is even less so after a year of sanctions and ostracism following Nato's bombing campaign.</p> <p>The Yugoslav leader is also using the incident to underscore his claims that the pro-western government of President Milo Djukanovic in Montenegro is in league with western spies and assassins determined to subvert the Yugoslav federation.</p> <p>As in Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, and Bosnia over the past decade, there is growing sentiment within Montenegro in favour of independence from the Yugoslav federation dominated by Serbia. But the Yugoslav army maintains 15,000 troops there and Mr Milosevic seems determined to thwart any attempt at secession.</p> <p>The recent G8 summit in Okinawa expressed support for the Montenegrin leader, as have the US, Britain and some other European countries. But two close neighbours, Italy and Greece, are more ambivalent, fearing another Balkan conflict on their doorstep.</p> <p>Mr Milosevic, meanwhile, calculates that despite expressions of solidarity, Nato countries would be extremely reluctant to launch another Kosovo-style intervention in Montenegro.</p> <p>The fate of the two policemen may now depend on the outcome of the September polls. Mr Milosevic's chances of re-election have been helped by a split among the notoriously fractious Serbian opposition parties, which currently plan to field two, rival anti-Milosevic candidates. If he wins, the \"hostages\" may be quietly released.</p> <p>If Mr Milosevic loses, all bets are off. As an indicted war criminal wanted by The Hague tribunal, and a man with few friends beyond Moscow and Beijing, he may refuse to relinquish power for fear of being arrested or being forced to go on the run.</p> <p>If he calculates that he is going to lose the election, Mr Milosevic could launch an even bigger internal crackdown than anything he has attempted in the past. He may also be tempted to provoke Montenegro into open conflict as a diversion from his own troubles and as a way of \"uniting\" the Serbs in fabricated adversity.</p> <p>He has tried such tactics several times in the past, and is ruthless enough not to balk at trying them again.</p>",
  "<p>I recently met a man who I'd have to describe as an acid casualty who has never taken acid. He claims to be a film-maker, and has recently directed an instructional video for would-be cult leaders called Mind Control Made Easy. This guy is, naturally, a Nietzschean at heart. And after a few too many beers at a Manhattan microbrewery, he can apply the principles of The Birth of Tragedy to explain his obsession with Britney Spears. \"It's the Dionysian drag of her ass and the Apollonian snap of her breasts that's got me hooked,\" he says. He does not own either of her albums because the drag and the snap have nothing to do with music. </p> <p>As Britney herself would say, Whatever. </p> <p>Like most pop culture phenomena, people's fascination with Britney Spears has absolutely nothing to do with what she is purportedly famous for, which is to say, singing and dancing. This is, most understandably, a source of huge frustration for Britney and for many other modern icons: they wish to be famous for their talent. After all, they insist, long before they became a thing, they sang schmaltzy ballads at wedding receptions or acted in soap operas, and were paid to do an honest day's work because they were good at it, not because they were famous, since they were not yet famous. </p> <p>Hence we have a situation wherein Demi Moore wants to be known as a great actress, not as a pregnant woman with a bare belly on the cover of Vanity Fair. Madonna wants us to believe that The Next Best Thing is a good movie, not that she is just a compelling cocoon of public metamorphoses and an occasional advocate of free expression. Marilyn Monroe married Arthur Miller and then more or less died of her desire to be more than a dumb blonde. </p> <p>Occasionally, the person actually does transcend the persona. Cher won an Oscar. Princess Diana devoted herself so thoroughly to international good deeds that, by the time of her death, she was actually thought of as an international do-gooder. But mostly you are left with a situation where Britney Spears can say to Rolling Stone: \"It's not about my personality. People couldn't see me through the radio.\" </p> <p>As if. </p> <p>Since I myself earned more notoriety for being naked on the cover of my book Bitch than for anything I actually wrote in the pages between, I am intrinsically and intuitively sympathetic with the burden of being Britney. It is, no doubt, a pain in the ass to be all tits and ass. But, my God, she is so good at it that I wish she would simply embrace this role and stop trying to deny it. </p> <p>Trouble is, unlike all the other aforementioned icons, Britney Spears's entire appeal is in denying her entire appeal. Unlike, say, Madonna, who never pretended to be anything other than an overtly sexual being, Britney Spears has built an entire image around insisting that she does not mean to be sexy. She can't help it if men get hot and bothered when they see her in a schoolgirl uniform, a plaid micro-mini with thigh-high tights and a top tied just below her breasts, the better to bare her slightly fleshy midriff. She can't help it if guys get excited over pigtails and baby fat, the two main characters in her very first video. And it is not her fault if people with dirty minds think that she is asking to be bent over and spanked when she begs a boy to \"Hit me baby one more time\". It's not her fault that grown-ups don't know that that's just a teenage way of asking a guy to call her pager. </p> <p>The hot pants and push-up bra on her first cover of Rolling Stone were just normal: down south where Britney comes from and sweat is plentiful, no one wears much clothing. The skin-tight vinyl in the video for Oops ... I Did it Again, the python outfit cut down to there and up to there designed especially for her 18th birthday party, the sequinned cleavage top that served as slight support for her absolutely natural bursting breasts at the American Music Awards and the clingy white jumpsuit she performed in at the Grammys are all a fashion statement, a fun day of dress-up for a little girl raiding Mommy's closet. Choosing Gregory Dark, a director of pornographic movies, to make the video for From The Bottom of my Broken Heart was simply an artistic decision, a tribute to his vision. And she cannot be blamed that lesser minds might find her Yorkshire terrier, Baby, and her tour bus full of puffy pillows and scented candles from K-Mart reminiscent of a New Orleans bordello. </p> <p>After all, she told YM magazine that she plans to stay a virgin until she is married, and despite rumours of a heady romance, Britney and Justin Timberlake - of the boy band 'N Sync - have only recently enjoyed their first kiss. She is still a good, Baptist girl from Kentwood, Louisiana, who is saddened that she often cannot find the time to attend church when she is on the road. And, whatever perverted fantasies might pollute the minds of men, most of her albums are purchased by pre-pubescent girls with innocent ears who like to sing along with danceable pop songs and love to imitate Britney's style. </p> <p>In her cover of the Rolling Stones' Satisfaction, lyrics like \"He can't be a man because he doesn't smoke the same cigarettes as me\" have been excised because Britney Spears would never smoke anything. In another twist on Satisfaction, she even delivers some babe-a-licious feminism: when the girl comes on and tells her \"how tight my skirts should be\", she doesn't pay attention because \"She can't tell me who to be/ I've got my own identity\". And when Britney sings the line, \"I'm not that innocent\", she is just being gamely in a song about playing games. </p> <p>She is a good actress who, like Brooke Shields as an 11-year-old prostitute in Louis Malle's Pretty Baby, does not really know the implications of the part she is playing. \"It's like on TV, if you see Jennifer Love Hewitt or Sarah Michelle Gellar kill someone, do you think they go out and do that?\" she asked in a recent Rolling Stone interview. And she is so good at insisting that she has no idea why more people search the internet for naked pictures of her than for any other celebrity that I must admit that I am not certain that she is in on her own image. Who the hell knows? </p> <p>All this is much too confusing for a simple girl like me. </p> <p>I like bubblegum music as much as the next person - if the next person happens to be 12 years old. But for all the emphasis on how Britney Spears is a product of some wizardly Swedish producers, I find both her albums damn near unlistenable; optically unnerving; jarringly brassy - like having your ears boxed with a pair of large metal cymbals. Her voice is nothing special. If Dear Diary is any indication, she can't write songs to save her life. And yet I admit I am charmed by Britney Spears. If I am confused by her pleas for sexual absolution, I completely believe that she is a sweet, sweet girl who has worked hard and deserves all her success. </p> <p>But there's something wrong with this. After all, sweetness should not sell albums; talent should. And I'm pretty convinced that she has little to none. Christina Aguilera, Britney's main rival for the teenybopper, girl-power audience, has a big, beautiful voice. And I think her song What A Girl Wants is a pretty good argument for boys' deference to female desire. But I can't stand Christina - she has none of the Britney charm, none of the sugar, none of the southern honey. Aguilera's music is less irritating, but her personality is more so. Britney wins on congeniality alone. </p> <p>And who can say that talent is anything so great anyway? Britney Spears's career is basically Debbie Gibson redux, right down to their early days entertaining shoppers as they passed between the Body Shop, the Gap and Laura Ashley in the local malls. Feature for feature, Debbie and Britney look unbelievably alike, neither one a beauty, but both full of cheerleader, popular-girl prettiness that makes them so appealing to teenage girls who can safely aspire to their bottled-blonde good looks. Just as Britney is linked with one of the members of 'N Sync, Debbie was constantly denying rumours that she was dating Jordan from New Kids On The Block. If it were 1988, this essay would be about Debbie Gibson. </p> <p>But instead of pondering her latent sexuality, any article about Gibson would beg the question about why such a talented teenager would be the purveyor of such schlock. After all, Gibson played the piano, had her own studio in the garage of her parents' Long Island home, actually wrote the songs on her albums and acted as her own producer and arranger. When I interviewed her back then, I kept asking her - to no avail - why she was the way she was. I kept saying in frustration that most adolescents with the abilities she had would be rebellious and nasty and would start bands and make a lot of noise, because gifted people usually are rebellious and nasty, and they usually can't curb the urge to make a lot of noise. Why wasn't she into grunge? Why wasn't she bitter and twisted the way talented people are supposed to be? </p> <p>And then I remembered that most riot grrrls have no actual musical talent, and, if they did, maybe they would be producing albums of silly love songs and odes to electric youth, just like Debbie Gibson. I kept confusing the means of production with the meaning behind it. I was a victim of false consciousness. After all, Lesley Gore was also known to write some of her own songs. </p> <p>At any rate, with all her talent, Debbie Gibson is nowhere to be found a decade later. She has done some musical shows, but her attempts to make sexy, adult albums with lushly produced videos by the sensual photographer Matthew Ralston did not result in the record sales that her teenage anthems once racked up. Without the vocal chops to really carry a theatrical career, Deborah Gibson - the name she uses on Broadway marquees - has mostly disappeared. </p> <p>In all likelihood, Britney Spears's fate will be similar. But who knows? Madonna was supposed to be a one-hit-wonder, and now all the prayers of the Church of England could not get rid of her. She has shown us that image-making is itself a genuine talent. Courtney Love was supposed to be a mere footnote to Kurt Cobain's career - but who's sorry now? The truth is, nobody knows the nature of evanescence or the secret of staying power. Come to think of it, nobody really knows why anything is as it is. </p> <p>As it happens, Britney Spears was shockingly funny when she recently hosted the comedy show Saturday Night Live. Playing a hip-hop hoodlum who used to be on The New Mickey Mouse Club and was now dissing Britney Spears, the real Spears was hilarious. She did a perfect self-parody. </p> <p>Or maybe she was just reading her lines. </p> <p>Somebody recently told me that I should get rid of my navel ring. She said it gave men the wrong idea. And, at 33 years old and no longer nubile, I apparently ought not be putting out that vibe. </p> <p>Now, I don't know how it is possible to give men \"the wrong idea\", or even what exactly that is. Probably something about being loose and wild and easy - a sure thing in the sack, shall we say. It's not so innocent. </p> <p>But in truth the main thing I can say about the ruby hoop in my belly button - besides that I like it - is that it hurt like hell to get it pierced. Serious pain. I mean, you cannot imagine. And then, for six months thereafter, we are talking about the kind of infections and assorted health problems of such a vile magnitude that one woman at a cocktail party was moved to warn me that it might lead to infertility. I spent so much time swabbing my poor, pussed-up navel with hypoallergenic soap and alcohol that I started to think it would have been less trouble to adopt a puppy. Or raise a child. </p> <p>But 10 years later, I still love it. </p> <p>Britney Spears recently got her navel pierced. What does it mean in her case? What was she thinking on that day in Hawaii when she and her girlfriends, these clean teens from Bayou country, walked into a tattoo parlour with skeletons everywhere, run by a \"lady who was, like, a devil worshiper or something\" and walked out with holes in their tummies? </p> <p>Actually, it means nothing. The signifier and the signified have gone their separate ways, as is always the case in current semiotic thinking. Men with long hair might vote for Tory MPs, guys with earrings - I mean in both ears - are usually not gay, Princess Zara has a tongue stud, Prince William wears an Eton vest meant to look like something out of Austin Powers, and a ring in the nose is a passing teenage fad that has nothing to do with worshipping Kali or Vishnu. There are hippie capitalists, there are millionaire computer programmers in Silicon Valley with purple hair. And so it has been for quite a while now. What, in this day and age, is really subversive? </p> <p>Is it Britney Spears herself, or the way she seems not to get it? Or is it the wink-wink way in which she appears to be a complete constructor of her own sexiness, feigning innocence? For that matter, is innocence subversive? </p> <p>We went through the light-of-my-life and fire-of-my-loins of Lolita so many years ago that by 1980 the Police could reference Nabokov in Don't Stand so Close to Me with casual knowingness. Just the same, in the United States you can buy a porn magazine called Barely Legal and a teenage pop star's career can still be built on her accidental sexuality. Of course, Humbert Humbert's fantasy about Lolita was predicated on the idea that she is unaware of \"her own lusciousness, that as a nymphet she is almost grubby and boyish\". But later in the book, Lolita - or rather, Dolores - takes the sexual power that Humbert has assigned her and turns it against both of them. By the end, she is a tawdry housewife, and her seducer and tormentor is a ruined man. Lolita did not age very well; awareness destroyed her just as Adam and Eve's eating from the Tree of Knowledge got them expelled from the Garden of Eden. </p> <p>How long can Britney Spears linger in paradise before all of us notice that her eyes were wide shut all along? </p> <p>Elizabeth Wurtzel is the author of Prozac Nation, her latest book is The Bitch Rules (Quartet). Britney Spears's latest single, Lucky, is released on Monday.</p> <p><strong>Rough guide to Britney by Jemima Sissons</strong></p> <p>Born December 2, 1981, in Kentwood Louisiana to a tightknit baptist family. Her mother is a teacher, her father a building contractor. </p> <p><strong> Career</strong> </p> <p>Auditioned for the Mickey Mouse Club when she was eight years old, but was too young. So after a spell on Broadway she joined the show at 11, along with rival Christine Aguilera and current boyfriend Justin Timberlake. </p> <p>Debut single Hit me Baby One More Time released in 1998. Album of the same name went straight to number one and sold 27m copies worldwide. </p> <p>Latest album, Oops ... I Did it Again, was released last May and has sold 13m copies so far. </p> <p><strong> Love</strong> </p> <p>Goes out with long time childhood sweetheart Justin Timberlake, her co-star in the Mickey Mouse Club.

  "Fifteen Serbian opposition parties yesterday chose the nationalist leader of the Democratic party of Serbia as their candidate to run in September against the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic. <p>\"We unanimously decided to name Vojislav Kostunica as our joint candidate,\" Dusan Mihajlovic, leader of the New Democracy party, said. </p> <p>Party officials met in Belgrade to make their decision after crisis talks with the biggest opposition party, the Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO), which had nominated its own candidate on Sunday despite appeals not to risk splitting the opposition vote by going its own way. </p> <p>The SPO leader, Vuk Draskovic, said that he had not changed his mind about his candidate, the Belgrade mayor Vojislav Mihajlovic, who the rest of the opposition fear will split the anti-Milosevic vote in the September 24 election. </p> <p>Mr Kostunica, chosen by the other parties because his nationalism reflects popular opinion in Serbia, yesterday abandoned his acceptance condition that Montenegro, Yugoslavia's smaller republic, would stop its boycott of the vote. The public was expecting him to run, he said. </p> <p>A recent opinion poll gave Mr Kostunica greater popularity than President Milosevic, while the Belgrade mayor backed by Vuk Draskovic has not even appeared on pollsters' lists. </p> <p>The Democratic party leader, Zoran Djindjic, said Mr Draskovic would not discuss a joint candidate. </p> <p>Mr Mihajlovic said that Mr Draskovic's insistence on his own presidential runner meant that he could not join their candidate lists for local elections, also due September 24. </p> <p>\"We unanimously supported the idea of going together with SPO to all elections, but after the SPO came out with its separate presidential candidate, we decided that a coalition is impossible at one level if there is competition at another.\" </p> <p>Mr Djindjic said Mr Kostunica's advantage was that he could travel to Montenegro and Kosovo, whereas Mr Milosevic could not. </p> <p>Montenegro's pro-western authorities have agreed to cooperate with the UN war crimes tribunal. It has indicted Mr Milosevic for war crimes committed by Serb forces last year in Kosovo before Nato bombing forced the withdrawal of the Yugoslav army from the province, which mainly ethnic Albanian . </p> <p>\"Our candidate can go everywhere,\" Mr Djindjic said. \"And where can Mr Milosevic go? To his bunker. Well, let him win in his bunker; we will win in Serbia.\" </p> <p>On the right, meanwhile, the ultra-nationalist Radical party has proposed Tomislav Nikolic, its vice-president and Yugoslav deputy prime minister, as its presidential candidate for September.</p>",
  "Once George W Bush selected Dick Cheney as his running mate, it became clear that Al Gore would need to make a smart, eye-catching choice of his own. In an election light on policy differences, questions of character are set to loom large - and the choice of potential deputy is about the most significant choice a presidential candidate ever makes. Today Mr Gore is set to name the baritone-voiced senator from Connecticut, Joseph Lieberman, as his No.2. It is certainly an eye-catching choice - for reasons that may not please the candidate. But is it a smart one? <p>In the credit column is Mr Lieberman's status as one of the senate's most respected figures. His willingness to break ranks and attack President Clinton early over the Monica Lewinsky affair should inoculate the Gore ticket on that issue. Now it will be much harder for Bush- Cheney to cast themselves as restorers of integrity to the Oval Office: Gore-Lieberman are squeaky clean. The senator also runs no risk of outshining the perennially dull Mr Gore, and reinforces the candidate's credentials as a moderate, \"new\" Democrat in the centrist, Clinton mould. </p> <p>But there is a downside. Mr Lieberman is cut from the same wooden timber as Mr Gore. What the Democrats needed on the ticket was a candidate with zip who might create genuine excitement. An immediate buzz would have come from picking only the second female candidate for national office in US history. Mr Gore could have done that; or at least picked a younger, fresher face. Instead he has chosen a man who is solid, worthy and of undoubted integrity - but who is unlikely to set this race on fire. </p> <p>One fact about Mr Lieberman is dominating the instant reaction to his choice: he is the first Jewish candidate for national office. And he does not just \"happen to be\" Jewish, but is a devout Jew who never works on the sabbath and who will do no campaigning during this autumn's high holidays. Some believe that will not only win over America's 6m Jewish voters but also play well with committed Christian voters who like politicians \"of faith\" - no matter what that faith is.</p> <p> But it also sets America a question. Just as John F Kennedy's candidacy asked America whether it was ready for a Catholic president, now the US has to decide if it is ready for a Jew a heartbeat away from the Oval Office. Just for raising that question, Mr Lieberman's choice is a welcome one.</p>",
  "Al Gore took a leaf out of George W Bush's book yesterday, opting for gravitas rather than glamour in his choice of vice-presidential running mate for the Democrats. <p>For all the occasional talk of putting a woman or a black candidate on the presidential ticket one day, both have in the end following the way of all but one of their predecessors: picking an ageing white male to reassure the voters. </p> <p>By choosing Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, Mr Gore gives the line-up an apparent symmetry of age and appeal. In both cases the younger man heads the ticket for the November 7 election. </p> <p>Although the age difference between the candidates and their running mates is narrow, the cultural gap on each ticket is much wider. </p> <p>Mr Gore, 52, and Mr Bush, 54, are self-evidently part of the same rock'n'roll generation as 53-year-old President Bill Clinton. But Mr Lieberman, 58, and the Republican vice-presidential nominee Dick Cheney, 59, could almost pass for their parents, and are unmistakably the products of the Eisenhower rather than the Kennedy years. </p> <p>The similarity ends there, however, since Mr Lieberman has much less experience of Washington and public life than Mr Gore, whereas Mr Cheney has been chosen in part to compensate for Mr Bush's glaringly short political track record. </p> <p>The two men's political histories are very different, too. Mr Cheney was a youthful Republican high-flyer, recruited to work in the Nixon White House while still in his 20s, becoming Gerald Ford's White House chief of staff at 34, and defence secretary under President Bush after 10 years as a Wyoming congressman. He remains a quintessential Washington insider. </p> <p>Mr Leiberman, on the other hand, has built his political career entirely in his home state, Connecticut. Born in Stamford, where his father owned an off-licence, he went to Yale (as did Mr Cheney, who dropped out), served in the state senate in 1970-80, ran unsuccessfully for Congress, and served two terms as Connecticut attorney general before winning a US Senate seat in 1988. </p> <p>At first sight both seem to have been picked for essentially defensive reasons. Mr Cheney brings White House experience to Mr Bush, Mr Lieberman brings integrity to the Democratic ticket. His moral stature helps Mr Gore to shake off the shadow of the Clinton-Lewinsky affair, to say nothing of the persistent allegations of campaign fundraising improprieties in 1996. </p> <p>Mr Lieberman was one of seven Democrats Mr Gore's spin-doctors said last week were under consideration. In reality, at least three of the short-list - Bill Bradley, Dick Gephardt and Jeanne Shaheen - were only there to make Mr Gore look broad-minded. The real choice came down to three senators: John Edwards of North Carolina, John Kerry of Massachusetts, and Mr Lieberman. </p> <p>All three have centrist political instincts, like Mr Gore, and each came with a characteristic whose political impact Mr Gore had to weigh carefully in making his choice: Mr Edwards is inexperienced, Mr Kerry is married to a Heinz foods heiress, and Mr Lieberman is now be the first Jew on a White House ticket. </p> <p>A further crucial contrast between was immediately apparent yesterday. While Mr Cheney spent his final hours before joining the Bush campaign arranging his tax affairs at the giant oil multinational Halliburton Corporation in Dallas, Mr Lieberman went ahead with a speaking engagement at a trade union conference in Hartford. </p> <p>\"I can't think of a place I'd rather be this morning at this momentous time in my life than with you, the working people of the state of Connecticut,\" he told them. Such words would be improbable, to say the least, coming from Mr Cheney. </p> <p>The two will spend most of the next three months going their separate ways. Mr Cheney is likely to spend much of the campaign in the south and west, where he will exploit his conservative record and views to mobilise the Republican voter base. Mr Bush, meanwhile, will take his greater appeal to moderates and independents to the swing states of the midwest. </p> <p>Mr Lieberman's role is likely to be less sectional. As a moderate he is certain to play a big role in the midwest himself. </p> <p>They will come face to face just once during the campaign, in a vice-presidential debate which will be televised from Danville, Kentucky, on October 5. </p> <p> <b>Vote getters</b></p> <p><b> \u0095Joseph Lieberman</b>: Senator 1988-present </p> <p><b> For</b> <br> Tax cuts for small businesses <br> Gulf war use of force resolution <br> Sale of F-15s to Saudi Arabia <br Welfare-to-work reform <BR> School vouchers experiment </p> <p><b> Against</b> <br> Ban on 'partial birth' abortion <br> Humanitarian aid to Cuba <br> Ban on flag-burning <br> Oil drilling in Alaskan wildlife reserves <br> Cutting aid to Vietnam <br> Cutbacks in national missile defence </p> <p> <b> \u0095Dick Cheney</b>: Congressman 1979-89 </p> <p><b> For</b> <br> Sale of Awacs to Saudi Arabia <br> Raising pensionable retirement age <br> Covert aid to Contras <br> Production of MX missiles <br> Humanitarian aid to contras <br> Cutting federal spending on health, labour and education </p> <p><b> Against</b> <br> Oil profits windfall tax <br> Equal rights amendment <br> South African sanctions and release of Nelson Mandela <br> Notifying workers before plant closures <br> Seven-day waiting period for hand-gun purchases</p>",
  "Al Gore staked his tottering White House dream on the high moral standing of America's first Jewish vice-presidential candidate yesterday, selecting Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut as his running-mate in a move that symbolically underlined the end of the Bill Clinton era. <p>\"Miracles happen,\" a delighted and emotional Mr Lieberman told reporters outside his home in New Haven. Mr Lieberman will be officially unveiled as the number two on the Democratic ticket at an event in Nashville today. </p> <p>Mr Gore's surprise choice finally draws the line between the Clinton years and his own candidacy in his attempt to overcome George W Bush's daunting poll lead. A Gallup poll yesterday showed Mr Bush 17 points ahead of Mr Gore following last week's Republican convention. </p> <p>No Democrat is better qualified to convey that message than Mr Lieberman, who on the Senate floor in September 1998 delivered the most memorable moral denunciation of Mr Clinton's conduct towards Monica Lewinsky of the 15-month impeachment crisis, castigating the president's behaviour as \"inappropriate, immoral and harmful\". </p> <p>The public reprimand was all the more telling because Mr Lieberman and Mr Clinton are old friends from Yale Law School days and political allies on the right of the Democratic Party, who agree on most issues of political substance. Mr Lieberman was the first senator to endorse Mr Clinton's presidential bid in 1992. </p> <p>\"I think he's one of the most outstanding people in public life,\" Mr Clinton said yesterday. \"He's a bold thinker. He's always full of new ideas.\" </p> <p>Mr Gore's choice of running mate is a gamble, more on account of the 58-year-old Connecticut senator's relative national obscurity than because of his religion as an orthodox Jew who refuses to campaign on the Sabbath. </p> <p>Mr Lieberman is from humble origins, the son of a drinkstore owner from Stamford. He has spent his whole career in Connecticut politics, where he was twice attorney-general before winning a US Senate seat in 1988. His wife, Hadassah, whose parents are Holocaust survivors, is also orthodox Jewish. The couple have four children. </p> <p>Before he made his attack on Mr Clinton, Mr Lieberman was most prominently in the public eye for his assaults on television and media depiction of violence and obscenity, in which he joined with the Republican campaigner William Bennett to denounce gangsta rap lyrics and the Jerry Springer Show, among many other targets. </p> <p>There are 11 Jewish senators, but Mr Lieberman is unusual in his observances of kosher dietary laws and Sabbath laws. When the senate meets between sunset on Friday and sunset on Saturday Mr Lieberman takes part, but walks three miles from his home to avoid using motor vehicles. </p> <p>The issue of Mr Lieberman's religion will be attentively watched in the Middle East, but is unlikely to be a major factor in the election, most observers believe, although it is in the nature of these things that few voters openly admit to anti-semitism. A poll in March 1999 suggested that 92% of Americans would vote for a Jew as president. </p> <p>The decision was welcomed as \"a milestone in America's political maturity\" by Abraham Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League. \"While anti-semites and those on the fringe of society who subscribe to conspiracy theories may have a field day, we remain confident the American people will dismiss the extremists and consider him on his public record,\" Mr Foxman said. </p> <p>By choosing Mr Lieberman, Mr Gore has opted for a running-mate from the Democratic right who can appeal to the electoral centre-ground which Mr Bush staked out last week in Philadelphia. </p> <p>Mr Lieberman has one of the most independent voting records among all Democratic senators, cooperates regularly with moderate Republicans, and has voted against his party on issues such as national missile defence and school voucher experiments, both of which he supports. </p> <p>Mr Bush had no public comment on his rival's choice yesterday, but his spokesman Ari Fleischer said Mr Lieberman was \"a good man. It's nice that the vice-president has picked someone who agreed with Governor Bush on so many issues.\" </p> <p>Even before getting Mr Gore's call, Mr Lieberman was quickly into on-message political action yesterday, telling a trade union rally in Hartford that he was \"happy to be here at a convention where working people are a priority, not as they were in Philadelphia last week, just props\".</p>",
  "For the Jewish community, Al Gore's choice of Joseph Lieberman is \"the equivalent of getting a man on the moon\" according to Rabbi Marvin Hier, the director and founder of the Museum of Tolerance and the Simon Wiesenthal Centre in Los Angeles. <p>It may be more than two centuries since Francis Salvador was voted on to the provincial congress in South Carolina in 1775 and thus became the first elected Jewish official in what is now the United States, but until very recently anti-semitism has been seen as a factor to be weighed by Jewish politicians seeking office. </p> <p>Now, said Rabbi Hier, that may be finally changing for ever. \"This is really untested on a national basis, but I think Al Gore has made an ingenious move,\" he said. </p> <p>Rabbi Hier predicted real pride in the Jewish community at Mr Gore's choice and that Mr Lieberman's moral position on President Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky would outweigh any lingering anti-semitism which he felt remained only in \"a small lunatic fringe\". </p> <p>He added: \"For years, Jews have voted for Christian politicians so I don't think there is any reason why Christians should not vote for Jews.\" </p> <p>A Gallup poll indicated last year that anti-semitism had decreased enormously in the last 50 years. In 1947, only 42% of the population said they would vote for a Jewish politician while the figure for 1999 was 92%. This reflects the great change in the US from a period when anyone who was not a White Anglo-Saxon Protestant was regarded as a political risk. </p> <p>John F Kennedy had to tackle the anti-Catholic prejudices of voters when he was elected in 1960. Demographic changes since then and the increase of the Latino vote now mean that Catholicism is probably an electoral boon. </p> <p>Although there are larger Jewish populations in both New York and Los Angeles than in Tel Aviv and the large numbers of established Jewish politicians in both areas reflect this, the Jewish communities in America's south and midwest are much smaller. Several states already have Jewish senators and there are strong Jewish populations in Florida, New Jersey and Ohio. </p> <p>Ed Rendell, the chairman of the Democratic party, who is also Jewish, told reporters at the weekend, before Mr Gore's decision: \"I don't think that anyone can calculate the effect of having a Jew on the ticket.\" </p> <p>He has since been criticised by Nathan Diament of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America who suggested that the remark might give legitimacy to anti-semitic views. </p> <p>While public attitudes to ethnic background and religion may have softened in the US, few politicians would dare declare themselves as atheist and it seems hard to imagine any Muslim achieving high national elected office given the levels of public prejudice still expressed against them. </p> <p>Locally, a specific ethnic background or religion can be a plus, depending on the makeup of the electorate. It did not harm Jerry Brown, twice elected as governor of California and now mayor of Oakland, that he was an active Buddhist. </p> <p>By chance, a Week Against Hate is launched this week in LA to mark the first anniversary of the shootings carried out by a white supremacist at the North Valley Jewish Centre that led to the death of a postal worker, Joseph Alieto, and the woundings of three Jewish children at the centre.</p>",
  "Sir Robin Day, who has died aged 76, was the most outstanding television journalist of his generation. He transformed the television interview, changed the relationship between politicians and television, and strove to assert balance and rationality into the medium's treatment of current affairs. <p>Day was the youngest of four children. His father, a Lloyd George Liberal, was on the administrative staff of the Post Office. Robin was educated at Bembridge school, had an uneventful war in the Royal Artillery, became a captain, and went on to St Edmund Hall, Oxford, in 1947 at the age of 24, to read law. He made his mark as a memorable president of the Oxford Union. </p> <p>After two years at the bar, he decided that the prospect of success was too distant. He spent one year with the British Information Services in the United States, was briefly employed, on a temporary basis, by BBC Radio and, in 1955, joined Independent Television News, at its launch, as one of its new breed of newscasters. </p> <p>ITN made him. It gave him, by his own account, his happiest four years in television - though he was not an instant success. It was originally felt that he was too unsympathetic and harsh in manner, but this view changed as he developed an entirely new style of interviewing. </p> <p>In the pre-Day era, television interviews were almost always respectful, generally dull and stiff, often insipid. Day asked the direct question pointed like a dagger at the jugular. The turning point in his career was an interview with Sir Kenneth Clark, then chairman of Independent Television, at a time when proposals were mooted to cut ITN's airtime and money. Day asked him questions about the station's future which dumbfounded colleagues and critics by their directness. It was unprecedented that the person in ultimate charge should be questioned about his responsibilities by one of his own employees - and the impact was dramatic. </p> <p>There followed a number of historic interviews which established Day's reputation: with Egypt's President Nasser after the 1956 Suez crisis, when Day sought to pin him down on whether he accepted the existence of the state of Israel; with ex-President Truman - \"Mr President, do you regret having authorised the dropping of the atomic bomb?\"; and, notably, with Prime Minister Harold Macmillan in 1958, in what the Daily Express called \"the most vigorous cross-examination a prime minister has been subjected to in public\". </p> <p>This interview turned Macmillan into a television personality, and was probably the first time that television became a serious part of the political process. Day also made parliament come alive with his unscripted reports of the heated debates during the Suez debacle. </p> <p>In 1959, Day moved to the BBC and Panorama, then the most prestigious current affairs programme. The corporation never really made the best use of his talents, except at elections and, eventually, on Question Time, between 1979 and 1989. The fashion turned against \"talking heads\" and \"government by debate\", with which he, above all others, was identified. He was gradually sidelined, as a chairman figure who simply opened and closed programmes. He described his pre-Question Time period as \"10 years in the wilderness\". There was even a spell of nearly two years when he did not appear at all. </p> <p>In the early-1970s, Day became more deeply involved in radio, where he proved an innovator with It's Your Line, from 1970 to 1976. This was a national phone-in programme that enabled ordinary people, for the first time, to put questions directly to the prime minister and other politicians (it later spawned Election Call). </p> <p>He also presented The World At One, from 1979 to 1987, but never felt that radio was his metier. He was not at his best reading from a script, and it is significant that, in his memoirs, he dismisses his eight-year contribution to the programme with a single sentence. </p> <p>General elections, however, were the time when all the grand inquisitor's talents as cross-examiner came on full display, when the televsion public saw \"the scowling, frowning, glowering\" Robin Day \"with those cruel glasses\" (Frankie Howerd's description), as well as the relieving shafts of humour. </p> <p>His most satisfying role in television came with Question Time. At last, he was given his own show, with an audience - which he had long asked for - albeit late at night, as a temporary, six- month \"filler\" and mainly as a way of giving him something to do. Its success in becoming, under his chairmanship, the most popular and effective current affairs programme on television reveals a great deal about his talents. </p> <p>Why did Robin Day become a national institution, one of the most immediately recognised people in the land, outshining in reputation and respect other television stars whose shows commanded far larger audience figures, and, as he much resented, far higher salaries? </p> <p>It was because he had a unique combination of qualities. He was a very big personality in the true sense, with immense authority. He was extraordinarily witty. A collection of good Day jokes would fill a minor anthology. Question Time also brought out his charm and showmanship. He was inordinately proud of his music-hall gifts, and would insist on showing visitors to his flat videos of his appearances on the Morecambe And Wise Christmas shows and (especially) his Flanagan and Allen rendering of Underneath The Arches on the Des O'Connor show, in which he outstarred and outsang O'Connor. But, above all, he was one of the most well-informed, widely read and serious political figures in public life. </p> <p>Day imbibed politics almost with his mother's milk. His father brought him up to revere parliament and great parliamentarians. As a nine-year-old, he was taken to hear Churchill speak, in the rain. Respect for parliament and the traditional institutions of British life, such as the monarchy and the legal profession, was at the heart of his philosophy all his life. </p> <p>It might be said that his interests were somewhat conventional and narrow. He was almost fixated by parliament, and seemed to think that if someone had made a great parliamentary speech, they had won a great battle, when, in fact, it was events outside parliament that were transforming British politics. His world was one of party politics and current events, rather than long-term trends. He was not particularly interested in industrial affairs or economics, or developments in European countries. </p> <p>Gradually, his private views became more and more conservative, at times rather narrowly nationalist, although he did not allow his personal prejudices to show in public or influence his professional performances. But, within the boundaries of his particular interests, he applied his formidable powers of argument and his extensive knowledge to devastating effect, in private as well as public. </p> <p>He believed passionately in \"government by debate\" and in the need for television to balance pictures of current events with reasoned analysis. Otherwise, the powerful visual impact of television would distort and trivialise. He was equally dedicated to the principle that the interviewer had a duty to be well-informed. </p> <p>Many observers commented on his careful preparation; few realised just how assiduous he was. He would read every current biography and autobiography, and nearly every government white paper. Without research assistants to supply him with background briefings, he would generally be better informed than the many cabinet ministers he interviewed. No wonder prime ministers treated him as their equal, and lesser mortals on the political scene regarded him with awe. </p> <p>Day's contribution to British public life was not confined to the media. For 25 years he campaigned tirelessly, and eventually successfully, for the televising of parliament - not in the interests of television, but of parliament itself. He claimed that he was the first to present the detailed arguments in favour, in a Hansard Society paper in 1963. </p> <p>He also played a major part in the establishment of the national lottery. When the Rothschild Commission on Gambling was set up in 1979, he wrote a letter arguing in detail for the kind of lottery we have today. Lord Rothschild wrote back questioning his arguments. Day replied refuting all criticisms; his arguments prevailed and the eventual report recommended the scheme Day had originally proposed. He followed up with endless letters to successive ministers with relevant responsibilities. </p> <p>In his private life, Day had two personalities. To those who did not know him, he could, at times, appear aggressive and insensitive, seemingly interested only in those who were important because of their fame, public success or wealth. He sometimes found it difficult to talk naturally to intelligent women. He might, to some, have seemed the quintessential member of the all-male Garrick club, one of his favourite haunts. </p> <p>To those who knew him well, however, he was the most stimulating, amusing, convivial and warmest of companions. He was one of those rare people who was genuinely loved by his friends. He was prepared to take infinite pains on their behalf. He was also surprisingly modest; despite his obvious success in public life, he frequently talked of his career as a relative failure, because he had not achieved anything solid. </p> <p>He regretted that he had never entered parliament - although he ran as a Liberal at Hereford in 1959 - and contributed to the real world of politics, instead of playing a secondary role through television. He thrived on his public fame and was proud to be the first television star to be knighted, but privately seemed to feel that his achievements did not compare with those of others who had made their mark in the more traditional professions, especially the law, or by writing learned books. </p> <p>In 1965, he married Katherine Ainslie, an Australian law don at St Anne's College, Oxford, and had two sons. The marriage was dissolved in 1986. One of the tragedies of his life was that his elder son never fully recovered from the effects of multiple skull fractures he sustained in a childhood fall. </p> <p>Some years ago, Day had a coronary bypass, and he suffered from breathing problems that were often evident when he was on the air. He had always fought against a tendency to put on weight. As an undergraduate, he weighed 17 stone, and claimed that, in the course of his life, he had succeeded in losing more weight than any other person. </p> <p>He is survived by his two sons. </p> <p> Robin Day, broadcaster and journalist, born October 24 1923; died August 6 2000</p>",
  "President Clinton admitted yesterday that the criticism of his wife Hillary's campaign for a Senate seat in New York has been painful and damaging. <p>With Mrs Clinton at his side, the president told a fundraising function in Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts: \"One of the things that really hurts me the most, if you listen to the tone of the campaign against her, it's basically: 'Don't vote for her because she's not from here [New York].' </p> <p>\"'Don't vote for her because why's she doing this? Don't vote for her - let me see how I can get you to resent her.'\" </p> <p>The only way she could lose, he said, was if the voters of New York became \"confused\". \"If they vote for the strongest person, or the most qualified person, or the person who could do the most, or the person with whom they agree, she wins.\" </p> <p>The most recent poll shows that Mrs Clinton is trailing her previously obscure rival, Republican congressman Rick Lazio, by more than seven points. </p> <p>Mr Clinton first entered the electoral fray on his wife's behalf three weeks ago when he took a moment off from the Middle East peace talks to telephone a sympathetic New York tabloid, denying a book's allegation that she had used anti-semitic slurs. But he did confirm in the process that she might make use of the odd curse word. </p> <p>Further evidence that the president and his wife believe that they do not get a fair hearing comes in the latest issue of Talk magazine, in which his former press secretary Dee Dee Myers said: \"He would often say the reason the press was so critical of him and of Hillary was: 'They resent us because we are the same age they are, we're all baby-boomers and they're just jealous and envious.'\"</p>",
  "During his first term as vice president of the United States, George Bush flew into London to speak at an American embassy lunch. It was a memorable occasion. During the meal itself, the noise of workmen assembling a portable podium prevented casual conversation. When the construction was complete, the vice president entertained his audience with a brief selection of his favourite platitudes. Robert Runcie, the Archbishop of Canterbury, wondered, sotto voce, if such large preparation had ever before produced so small a result. <p>When the ambassador announced that the vice president was willing to answer three questions, Denis Healey cried: \"Good, I have three questions to ask.\" The first concerned the moral propriety of a superpower imposing its form of government on small nations. The concept was too complicated for Bush to comprehend. So Healey made the same point in less cerebral language. \"When a man has electrodes fastened to his genitals, he is not consoled by the thought of an election in 10 year's time.\" </p> <p>Some of the lunch guests disapproved of Healey's descent into the harsh realities of counter-insurgency. But everyone agreed that George Bush's address had been an embarrassment. Last Friday evening, watching the Republican convention on television, it was clear to me that the genes - augmented by what George W Bush had learnt at his father's knee - were working well. There was only one fundamental difference between George Bush's embassy address and the speech with which his son accepted the Republican nomination. Dad was better. </p> <p>While George Bush was adjudged a catastrophe, George W was congratulated on a triumph - even by newspapers that should be more discriminating. It goes to show that, in the 20 years which separate the two events, life has changed. These days, politicians are expected to rely on vacuous generalities, and they win applause for anodyne assurances that are calculated not to cause offence. They are no longer judged on the courage of their convictions or the relevance of their policies. </p> <p>Likely winners are good. Potential losers are bad. The encomiums that George W received were not for delivery or content. He did well because he said nothing to prejudice his opinion poll lead. </p> <p>That is the only explanation for the praise which has been lavished on a speech that promised \"a new beginning\", the certain winner of the Cliche of the Century Competition. And it got worse. George W believes that \"prosperity can be a tool in our hands used to build and better our country\" - a stern reproof to anyone who believes that prosperity is a disaster that good presidents avoid. He went on to promise tax cuts \"for everyone in every bracket\", an undertaking so recklessly unattainable (without a massive penalty imposed on those who rely on state spending) that even the Conservative party has abandoned it. Not even William Hague at his worst would have intoned \"The night is passing, we are awaiting for the day to dawn.\" </p> <p>George W Bush is offering Americans the politics of nothingness. That must be a fraudulent prospectus. For Americans have the politics of nothingness already. And it looks as if Al Gore will follow in President Clinton's tradition. I give George W credit for planning to face the great issues. But he will deal with the needs of the poor and the demands of the minorities in a way that depresses rather than improves their condition. He cannot admit that now, because to do so would sacrifice the support of enlightened America as well as the votes of the minorities themselves. All credit to the country for that. But only odium for the candidate who, fearing the decent impulse, hides behind banalities. </p> <p>No sensible person could have listened to the speech that George W Bush made in Philadelphia last week without realising what a tawdry manifesto he offers. It was delivered in the monotone of a man who had arrived too late to read the text in private before the public performance. Yet the style was superior to the substance. For it represented what the ad-men regard as the apotheosis (and decent people dismiss as the nadir) of new politics. It was the clear product of focus groups and opinion polls. But it made a nod to virtue by denouncing reliance on focus groups and opinion polls. </p> <p>Perhaps the demand for \"a bipartisan approach to governing\" makes more sense in American politics than it does in Britain. But the commitment to \"extend the promise of prosperity to every forgotten corner of the country\" is clearly inconsistent with the aspirations of a presidential candidate who is a hostage to big business. It all adds up to stock market politics - the endorsement of a second-rate product as long as it is likely to provide the speculators with short-term dividends. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\"> comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "President Abdurrahman Wahid of Indonesia apologised to his country yesterday for failing to resolve its myriad crises since taking office, and promised wholesale change to halt what he called the accelerating slide towards national disintegration. <p>In his first state of the nation address to the supreme legislative body since becoming the country's first democratically elected president in October, Mr Wahid cast aside the belligerence of recent months and sought to mend relations with the increasingly hostile legislature, which has been threatening to oust him. </p> <p>The MPs, who are about to investigate him for alleged corruption, applauded the apology but expressed dissatisfaction at the lack of substance in the 85-minute speech. </p> <p>They indicated that they would rebuke but not impeach him, and hinted that his best survival strategy would be to become more of a figurehead. </p> <p>Speaking to the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) on the opening day of its annual 12-day session, Mr Wahid said he had learned from his \"shortcomings and weaknesses\". </p> <p>\"To all the Indonesian people I humbly apologise for being unable to completely solve the prevailing problems during the last 10 months,\" the almost-blind Mr Wahid said in the address, which was read by his cabinet secretary. </p> <p>Once the session was over, he said, he would revamp his cabinet and concentrate himself on foreign affairs. </p> <p>\"I will leave the [domestic] technical matters in the hands of those who know best.\" </p> <p>Mr Wahid has been increasingly criticised for his unpredictable style of government, which involves giving little guidance to ministers and has resulted in policy inertia. </p> <p>He has blamed the government's failings on the fact that he could not choose his ministers but was forced, for the sake of national unity, to accept a coalition of many political interests. </p> <p>The failure was reflected in the president's gloomy analysis of the state of the nation. Widespread and increasing separatist and ethnic violence were threatening to wrench Indonesia apart, he said. </p> <p>\"The dangerous symptoms and currents of national disintegration are getting stronger. Our nation-state is now politically confronted with threats to its territorial and national integrity.\" </p> <p>Adding to the problem, the president said, was the lingering economic crisis, which had \"pulverised our nation\" and \"resulted in the degradation of people's welfare and the deterioration of important economic institutions\". </p> <p>His critics were united in condemning the lack of detail in his address, and his failure to get to grips with the country's problems, but divided on what should be done. </p> <p>Some said more power should be given to Vice-President Megawati Sukarnoputri, others advocated the creation of a first minister and the reduction of the presidency to the role of national figurehead. </p> <p>But despite the president's show of contrition, few analysts believe Mr Wahid is willing to become a figurehead just yet.</p>"
