  "American political scientists have just held their annual get-together and the consensus was strong: using five different measures (including that old standby, the state of the polls on Labor Day, September 4, the unofficial start of the campaigning season), Al Gore comes out ahead in November's presidential poll. <p>Here, having burnt their fingers in 1992, elections experts are circumspect. Tony Blair will win the general election everyone expects will take place next May. But at a Political Studies Association conference last weekend at Edinburgh University, they sought to hedge the bet. The question becomes: what could possibly happen between now and next May to upset the apple cart? </p> <p>History, as the Financial Services Authority insists we are reminded before we buy a policy, is no guide to the future. But landslide victories do not always last. The great Liberal triumph of 1906 dissipated at subsequent elections. Similarly, Clement Attlee's triumph in 1945 turned to ashes in 1950. Apply the 1945-50 rate of attrition to Tony Blair and next May he will win 382 seats (38 down on 1997). Apply the 1906-10 rate of attrition and he will still be winning some 375 seats, with handsome majorities over all parties in both cases. </p> <p>Except that - number-crunchers are quick to point out - is not quite the right way of putting it. Labour did not, as conventional wisdom has it, win a landslide in 1997 - it was a Tory collapse. Labour took only some 850,000 more votes in May 1997 than in 1992. More to the point, the Tories took 1,260,000 votes fewer in 1997 than in 1992. The Liberal Democrats also lost, recording 330,000 fewer votes in 1997 but in the \"right\" seats. By luck and judgment they amassed votes in seats where they were in head-to-head contests with Tories. </p> <p>Put in these terms, the critical seats next election are the 152 won by Labour from the Tories, constituencies encompassing some 10.5m electors. Among these are two key groups - voters who switched their allegiance from Tory to Labour and ex-Tories who simply could not bring themselves to vote in 1997. This sounds like Philip Gould territory. There are some data on which of Labour's 1997 voters are remaining loyal, in the sense of telling pollsters they intend to vote Labour again next time. More up Mr Gould's street is working out what is pushing \"defectors\" - of whom there seem, interestingly, to be more among foremen and supervisors than either the salariat or the working class and more in Scotland than Greater London. The defection pattern is mixed geographically: Labour is losing relatively more in the south and midlands than other regions. The only consistent predictor of tendency to defect seems to be housing tenure - which implies that Labour's \"heartland\" among council tenants is as secure as ever. Worryingly for pro-Europeans, anti sentiments are strong among defectors: according to one survey, 25% of defectors from Labour want to leave the European Union altogether. Even half of Labour loyalists would vote against membership of the euro. </p> <p>But no one is saying Europe is going to be an issue that determines votes at the general election, however people may vote in a one-off referendum - but it is going to be tricky for Labour to negotiate these shoals. (Surveys last month confirmed that, unprompted, the largest number of people said health was the most important issue facing Britain today.) Pro-Europeans cosily imagine that when debate gets going, sentiment will turn as people learn more. It could go the other way. According to one study, the more the media go on about Europe, the firmer anti views will become, and the more the Tories will benefit. </p> <p>The same study turns out to be complimentary to journalists. During election periods, thanks to media attention to issues, voters do learn considerably more about what is at stake. Their voting intentions and their attitudes become more consistent the closer we get to actual elections. One conclusion is that polls taken in between elections are less reliable, because people are paying less attention to issues and not really thinking much about their electoral preferences. </p> <p>But we must not exaggerate. Some 35% of the public do not regularly read a national daily newspaper, according to the latest data collected by Mori. (It included the Daily Record, Scotsman and Herald and the Sunday papers.) And remember, people do not read newspapers for political news - they read them for television and radio listings (this was the top category in a 1996 Mori study for the City University), for lifestyle, health information and entertainment. </p> <p>So will the media do anything during the next six months or so to affect the outcome? There is little evidence that the bias of newspapers has any causal weight. </p> <p>So if the Sun (18% of all regular newspaper readers) changed its tune and went with Hague, would voters follow? The answer is complicated by the \"don't knows\". Readers of a sample of papers who won't vote and the don't knows constitute 26% of Sun readers. What could Wapping possibly do to encourage them? A Murdoch campaign for civic participation would be interesting to witness. </p> <p>Which leaves the pollsters unwilling to say it out loud but conclusive. Nothing is going to happen during the next six months to dislodge Labour's considerable lead. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:david.walker@theguardian.com\">david.walker@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p><strong> Hobson's Choice</strong> </p> <p>(David Lean, 1954) </p> <p>5pm, Carlton Cinema </p> <p>Delightful screen version of Harold Brighouse's stage comedy, filmed in Salford. It's beautifully played, with Charles Laughton as the overbearing, boozy bootmaker tied up in knots by eldest daughter Brenda de Banzie and her dim but lovable husband, John Mills. Funny, and warm as a ferret up a trouser leg. </p> <p><strong> The Craft</strong> </p> <p>(Andrew Fleming, 1996) </p> <p>8pm, FilmFour </p> <p>With its four teenage girls ganging up to challenge their outsider status at a posh LA college, the references come thick and fast in this funny supernatural tale - Heathers meets Witches Of Eastwick by way of Carrie. Robin Tunney is the new girl at school whose telekinetic powers bring her into the orbit of punkette Fairuza Balk, the scarred Neve Campbell, and Rachel True, a black victim of racism. Together they form a coven and start to exact revenge, with some genuinely chilling tricks up their sleeves. </p> <p><strong> The Omen</strong> </p> <p>(Richard Donner, 1976) </p> <p>11.35pm, FilmFour </p> <p>More black magic. When people call young Damien a little devil, they ain't kidding. The adopted son of American ambassador Gregory Peck (Charlton Heston was first choice) and Lee Remick has an impish sense of humour, making his nanny hang herself, for instance. But then, Damien is the son of Satan. Quality horror, this; scary without overly resorting to gore, the hair-raising Ave Satani screeching away in the background and a cast including David Warner, Billie Whitelaw and Leo McKern that takes it seriously. </p> <p><strong> Afterglow </strong></p> <p>(Alan Rudolph, 1997) </p> <p>1.25am, Sky Premier </p> <p>Leisurely, painfully comic study of two failing marriages. Jonny Lee Miller is young, ambitious, sure that everything is fine at home; but sexually frustrated wife Lara Flynn Boyle is far from happy and instantly attracted to philandering repairman Nick Nolte, husband of Julie Christie's fragile ex-movie actress. The relationships are finely drawn in indie director Rudolph's witty, perceptive script. </p>",
  "If people want moral uplift, Harold Macmillan used to say, they should look to their bishops. But our own pious prime minister in New York last week, as he privately approved the Sierra Leone hostage rescue assault plan, was publicly propounding morality as a basis for policy: it is the west's duty to combat \"bad governance\" in Africa. <p>He might have stopped to reflect that politicians who claim the moral high ground usually get what they deserve. His government has been here before, living to regret the phrase \"ethical foreign policy\". </p> <p>A party document on foreign policy to be launched at conference no longer makes Robin Cook's boast that Labour would \"make Britain once again a force for good in the world\". Since the election, Mr Cook has learned about the difficulties of a country which is a large arms manufacturer claiming to act as a force for good. In opposition, Labour made humanitarian noises about the wickedness of selling arms to repressive regimes. In office, the problem was again discovered about what happens when moralism comes up against the word \"jobs\". </p> <p>The new document promises \"a more responsible arms trade\", but this is humbug. One might as well speak of a more responsible slave trade. There are really only two honest arms policies. One could be called the Alan Clark principle - to sell murderous weapons to all comers who can pay ready cash, and then let whichever savage despots have bought them use them to kill their subject peoples, young conscripts in their neighbours' armies, or British soldiers as the case might be. </p> <p>The other is not to engage in this disgusting trade at all. The argument that \"if we don't sell them, someone else will\" could be just as well used by a drug-pusher. And Labour MPs who mutter about the jobs of constituents making armoured vehicles should be asked whether they would take the same line with factories making poison gas. </p> <p>There are also two honest approaches to broader foreign policy, both well understood in the 19th century. One is \"political realism\". Instead of using exalted language, Palmerston merely said that England had no permanent friends and no permanent enemies, only permanent interests. And Bismarck said that the great issues of the day would not be decided by resolutions and majority votes but by blood and iron. </p> <p>What they disliked was dressing up the use of force in sentimental terms. The Crimean war was meant to be \"ethical\", but Aberdeen, who was prime minister when the war began, bitterly regretted it, and felt tainted by it ever after. He would have been appalled by a British government which preached ethics while selling arms to Indonesia and sending aircraft to the Balkans to kill women and children in a country with which we were not at war. </p> <p>That intervention was meant to be an ethical policy, just as the original American intervention in Vietnam was. When he became president, Kennedy had famously promised to \"pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, to assure the survival and the success of liberty\". He thought he was doing that in Indo-China, as Mr Clinton and Mr Blair thought they were in the Balkans, and perhaps Sierra Leone, with dubious results. </p> <p>As to the other honest policy, there is, or was, a long tradition in this country of principled non-interventionism. It was at one time called Cobdenism after Richard Cobden who, with his great ally John Bright, opposed military interference. Like those who opposed the \"ethical\" bombing of Serbia or Iraq, they were accused of a lack of sympathy for the victims of oppression. That was answered by Bright: \"I have sympathy with Turkey, I have sympathy with the serfs of Russia; I have sympathy with the people of Hungary\" - or, one could now say, with the peoples of Kosovo, Iraq, or Sierra Leone. </p> <p>\"But it is not on any question of sympathy that I dare involve this country, or any country, in a war which must cost an incalculable amount of treasure and of blood. It is not my duty to make this country the knight-errant of the human race.\" </p> <p>Too many of the western leaders who met in New York did see themselves as knight-errants, Tony Blair notably among them. If he really wants to set an example against bad governance, there are other ways. </p> <p>Try instead another noble sentence of Cobden's: \"The progress of freedom depends more upon the maintenance of peace, the spread of commerce, and the diffusion of education, than upon the labours of cabinets and foreign offices.\" Mightn't that be the basis for a truly ethical foreign policy? </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:wheaty@compuserve.com\">wheaty@compuserve.com</a></p>",
  "Few people are able to start, two years after the usual retirement age, a new career which makes them better known than anything they did in their past lives. But Bill Waddington, who has died in hospital after suffering from Parkinson's disease, aged 84, the entertainer who played Percy Sugden, the officious yet good-natured functionary always eluding Phyllis Pearce's blue-rinsed blandishments in Granada TV's long-running soap Coronation Street, was one of the fortunate few. <p>He was 67, living alone and disconsolate after the death of his wife Lilian had ended 32 years of conspicuously happy marriage, when, in 1983, he received the telephone call that revived his professional life. Waddington had first met his wife when, as Lilian Day, she was a regular principal boy in pantomime. After her death, he still talked aloud to her, in their modest home near Manchester, in the hope of getting some fresh pattern and meaning to his life. </p> <p>That call from Granada wanted to know whether, after a lifetime spent amiably as a comedian (beginning in the second world war), he would play the irascible, unpredictable new community centre caretaker Percy Sugden, conceived of as a former Desert Rat with a flat cap and a pencil moustache. </p> <p>Waddington himself was far from sure, but was determined to give it a try. He asked to see some scripts. In the end, he found that as long as he played the character dead straight, he could give Sugden humour, just as self-important but well-intentioned people in real life can easily appear funny. </p> <p>Waddington was born in the middle of the first world war - and almost in the middle of the lunchtime drinks his mother was serving in the pub his father was managing for a friend, the Clarence Hotel in Oldham. She went upstairs to have her son, rather to the irritation of his over-worked father, a pliant carpenter who had first turned butcher to work in his ambitious wife's butchery business, and had then agreed to stand in as pub landlord for a friend who had joined up in the war. Waddington always thought he got his easy humour from his father, his will to hold people's attention from his forceful mother. </p> <p>Expelled from his first school for being unruly, and at the age of ten expelled from Oldham parish church choir for pinching two bananas from the harvest festival display, he went to grammar school, but left at 14 after being described as \"the clown for the class\". </p> <p>He had already done his first comic writing - a poem written after his boyhood crush, Gladys, suddenly got her long hair cut, revealing a dirty neck: \"Oh Gladys, your neck/ Is a dirty old wreck/ And something is wanted to clean it./ Pan shine and soap/ May be a hope/ But emery's the stuff and you need it.\" </p> <p>His flair for comedy was turned to more practical and chivalrous account when serving in his mother's butchery shop, increasing its turnover. When his mother, possibly enjoying another strong personality better from a distance, suggested he branch out for himself, he got a job selling medical equipment, which was overtaken by the second world war. </p> <p>An admirer of the comedian George Formby, Waddington had mastered the ukelele and became an entertainer in the army's Blue Pencils concert party. He wrote his own comedy routines. These were well received by the radio critics when the BBC broadcast excerpts. Soon he was billed as \"the Army's Top Comic\". </p> <p>As a postwar civilian comedian he was for 20 years, on a simple handshake, under the wing of the agents and impresarios Lew and Leslie Grade. He appeared with top calibre artists like Lena Horne and Frankie Laine, did a Royal Variety Performance, ran a Rolls Royce, bought a farm, failed as a pig rearer but succeeded as a breeder of racehorses at the stud he owned in Shropshire. </p> <p>Racehorses remained a passion even after the traumatic death of his wife Lilian in 1980, when he found himself talking to a pile of manure: \"I'll be back to clean you up in a minute,\" he said. That lapse into sanitary conversation told him that he badly needed a new interest. </p> <p>Coronation Street and its off-screen social life supplied it. He was even thrilled when Percy Sugden's grumpiness won him the title, through a tabloid newspaper poll, of the third most hated person on TV, after JR of Dallas and Alexis of Dynasty. His character left the Street to move to a care home in 1997 after Waddington reportedly objected to the soap's ever-more racy storylines. </p> <p>He married four times - once, briefly, during the war, then long and successfully to Lilian, by whom he had two daughters, Anne and Barbara. After Lilian's death in 1982 he married Irene, again briefly, and then, in 1995, Sheila, who survives him.</p>",
