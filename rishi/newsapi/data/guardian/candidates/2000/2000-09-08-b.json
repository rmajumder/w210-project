  "France was facing a political dilemma last night after the three \"wise men\" appointed by the European Union recommended that the diplomatic quarantine of Austria - long backed by Paris - should end. <p>Austria's respect for human rights is \"no less than in other EU member states\", their report concludes. </p> <p>President Jacques Chirac was studying the report, which is said to give Vienna's conservative-led government a clean bill of health despite the continuing participation of the anti-foreigner, far-right Freedom party. </p> <p>According to a leaked version of the 119-point document, published on a Spanish media website, the \"wise men\" believe that it would be \"counter-productive\" to continue the sanctions adopted against Austria by all its of its EU partners after the chancellor, Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel, formed his coalition in February. </p> <p>\"The measures have already generated nationalist sentiments in Austria, above all because they have sometimes been wrongly interpreted as sanctions against the Austrian people,\" the report adds. </p> <p>The \"wise men\" strongly criticise the Freedom party itself, even though J\u00f6rg Haider, infamous for his sympathetic remarks about the Nazi period, has officially resigned as its leader. They say that the party's election campaign created an atmosphere where openly xenophobic demonstrations were a normal event. But in general, violence against foreigners has been less frequent in Austria than in other EU countries, they add. </p> <p>France is the current holder of the EU's rotating presidency and, with Belgium, was a prime mover behind the decision to impose sanctions, so backing down now could be difficult for Mr Chirac. Most other EU members, including Britain, are keen for the measures to end, as is the commission president, Romano Prodi, who is expected to meet Mr Chirac in Paris today. </p> <p>The \"wise men\" - the former Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari, the former Spanish foreign minister Marcelino Oreja and an international lawyer, Jochen Frowein of Germany - were commissioned to produce their report in June after months of impasse that came to bitterly divide the EU. </p> <p>Specifically, the panel's job was to determine if the Austrian government respects \"common European values\" of democracy and human rights. </p> <p>The freeze on bilateral relations, boycotts of school trips, cultural exchanges and military exercises, has had little impact on business and tourism in Austria. But officials in Brussels fear that it could delay vital preparations to admit new member states from eastern Europe. </p> <p>The issue is complicated by the fact that Austria plans to hold a referendum on the sanctions next month, which is likely to produce a strong anti-EU vote. </p> <p>The action against Austria has also alienated voters in Denmark and become an important factor in this month's knife-edge referendum on whether to adopt the euro in place of the krone.</p>",
  "The embattled Republican presidential candidate George W Bush has been forced to respond to a chorus of party criticism and a run of bad poll results by re-energising his campaign style and giving his slogans a face-lift in the contest with the Democrat Al Gore. <p>Mr Bush has decided to increase the tempo of what has sometimes seemed an unduly leisurely schedule. Instead he now intends to be seen getting in among the voters more, cutting down on set-piece speeches in favour of more glad-handing, and campaigning on a new theme of \"Real Plans for Real People.\" </p> <p>\"I've got to get out and talk to people, and I'm going to do a lot of it,\" Mr Bush said in Pennsylvania yesterday. \"I'm going to tell you what I think, and let the political chips fall where they may.\" </p> <p>Mr Bush has decided to redefine himself as the underdog in the race with Mr Gore, who has drawn level and even moved ahead of him for the first time in some recent opinion polls. The move echoes a change of direction in Mr Bush's campaign for the Republican nomination earlier this year after John McCain defeated him in the New Hampshire primary. </p> <p>Mr Bush has also signalled that he wants to extricate himself from the cul-de-sac he got himself into over the planned series of debates with Mr Gore later in the autumn. In a U-turn from the position he adopted as recently as Monday, Mr Bush has reopened negotiations with Mr Gore on the debate schedule. </p> <p>Criticism of the Bush campaign from within the party has focused on a range of perceived failings, including the strategy towards the debates. Other issues include the use of negative advertising, the failure to make the case for Mr Bush's $1.3 trillion (\u00a3900bn) tax cut plan, the lacklustre performance of Mr Bush's running-mate Dick Cheney, and the tight control exercised by Mr Bush's Texas-based team in Austin. </p> <p>But with the polls showing that Mr Bush's lead of a few weeks ago has now evaporated, the Republican challenger is eager to shore up his support by claiming that he is facing the fight of his political life. </p> <p>\"This is going to be a tight race,\" Mr Bush said. \"I guess my supporters wanted it to be a runaway. The vice-president is running a strong race, but so am I. I am under no illusions and neither should our supporters be. I am the underdog - I sure am.\" </p> <p>Mr Bush tried to laugh off several days of increasingly vocal criticisms of his campaign from within his own party. \"That's Washington,\" he told reporters in Michigan. \"That's the place where you find people getting ready to jump out of the foxholes before the first shell is fired.\" </p> <p>Asked why he has decided to change tack by going more informal, Mr Bush responded: \"Well, it's a better picture.\" </p> <p>What is officially described as a campaign \"retooling\" comes as three new polls showed Mr Gore either tied with Mr Bush or ahead of him. A Zogby poll has Mr Gore leading by 46% to Mr Bush's 40%, while the first of a series of Gallup three-day tracking polls has Mr Gore up by 47% to 44%. A Washington Post poll shows the two men level on 47% each. </p> <p>The latest poll in one of the key states in the election also shows Mr Gore taking the lead in Missouri by 45% to 41%. </p> <p>Mr Bush's slide in the polls in the past two weeks has provoked a mood of near panic among some of his supporters. \"There's no doubt about it. There's real worry about the general state of things,\" said the conservative campaigner William Bennett, a former education secretary. \"There's nervousness that was not there before.\" </p> <p>\"The biggest mistake we can make is to try to be all things to all people,\" the Missouri congressman John Kasich said. </p> <p>\"I'm at a loss to explain the rather significant change in the polling numbers,\" Tom Ridge, governor of Pennsylvania, said.</p>",
  "<p>Mitsubishi Motors was forced yesterday to suffer fresh indignities to atone for its 20-year cover-up of vehicle defects with the resignation of its president and the ceding of boardroom influence at a bargain price to foreign partner, DaimlerChrysler. </p> <p>Adding to a day of woe for Japan's fourth biggest car manufacturer, the government filed criminal charges against the company for failing to report customer complaints in a systematic deception that the transport ministry described as \"extremely evil\". </p> <p>In an emotional press conference, Mitsubishi president Katsuhiko Kawasoe said he would resign to take responsibility for the scandal, which has forced the company to recall a million cars across the world. </p> <p>\"I offer my deepest apologies for the great trouble that we have caused our customers with this problem,\" said a red-eyed Mr Kawasoe who was heralded as \"Mr Clean\" when he took the post amid a pay-off scandal three years ago. </p> <p>Although he will be replaced by another Mitsubishi executive, vice-president Takashi Sonobe, the biggest change announced yesterday was the allocation of a boardroom seat for DaimlerChrysler. </p> <p>The world's fifth biggest car maker is in the process of taking a 34% stake in Mitsubishi, but the scandal has allowed it to do so on far more favourable terms. DaimlerChrysler said it has negotiated a 10% discount in the price of the shares it is buying, which will now go for $1.9bn (\u00a31.3bn) rather than the initially agreed $2.1bn. It has the option to buy the company outright in three years. </p> <p>This may not be necessary. The new boardroom seat is expected to be allocated to Rolf Eckrodt, head of Daimler's Adtranz rail division, who is tipped to take the post of chief operating officer. </p> <p>Investors hope that he will emulate the performance of another foreign executive at a Japanese car maker, Carlos Ghosn, the chief executive of Nissan, who was has pushed ahead rapidly with restructuring sinces Renault took a one-third stake. </p> <p>Mitsubishi has a debt burden of \u00a51.5 trillion (\u00a39.5bn). Before the company can be turned around financially, it has to restore its reputation -an effort that has already cost more than \u00a575bn in global recalls.</p>",
  "<p>Aston Villa's shareholders delivered a damning verdict on their controversial chairman Doug Ellis yesterday by refusing to re-elect him to the board at the club's annual meeting. </p> <p>Ellis, chairman since 1982, was defeated 60-40 on a show of hands at the stormy meeting. He was visibly shaken by the verdict, which followed his second inquisition by shareholders in less than 24 hours; he had also been given a rough ride by 500 or more at a pre-agm fans' forum on Thursday evening. </p> <p>\"Judging by the reaction it appears I do not have the support of the shareholders present,\" he said after the fans' forum. \"But I know I have the support of the majority of shareholders and the people of Birmingham because of all the letters I receive.\" </p> <p>The 77-year-old is taking a Canute-like approach to the tide of criticism, but it was the second vote of no confidence he has suffered in the six times he has stood for re-election and if he were not the major shareholder his hold on office would be precarious. </p> <p>\"We want him off the board for the good of the club,\" said Jonathan Collett, a spokesman for the newly formed Aston Villa Independent Supporters Association. </p> <p>Ellis was also given the thumbs-down in 1986 when he was defeated by Buck Chinn, the chairman of the Aston Villa Shareholders Association. Then, as is expected again this time, Ellis retained his seat because of his substantial shareholding. He holds 46% of the stock and, with proxy votes still to be counted, he will be re-elected when the second ballot is held on Monday. </p> <p>The Aston Villa Independent Supporters Association had much to do with the vote against Ellis and wanted the proposed 9p dividend to shareholders to be channelled into team building instead. </p> <p>Last year's reported loss of \u00a34.8m followed a profit of \u00a320m for the previous 12 months, and shares worth \u00a33.42 apiece after being valued at \u00a311 at flotation only three years ago are symptoms of the malaise. Average attendances for Premiership games also fell by 5,000 last season. </p> <p>The dissent mirrors the feelings aired by the captain Gareth Southgate, Ugo Ehiogu and Julian Joachim. All three are keen to leave, with Southgate and Ehiogu citing the club's lack of ambition as the main reason. Villa have yet to win this season. </p> <p>To add to the gloom at Villa Park, it was revealed last night that the manager John Gregory had made an unsuccessful attempt to sign Real Madrid's midfielder Steve McManaman, who is included in the Spanish club's squad to face Valenica today. </p> <p>Henning Berg, 31, has re-joined Blackburn on a three-month loan after struggling to get a game with Manchester United. \"I am delighted to be back and I certainly know my way around this place,\" he said. \"I had no hesitation in agreeing. If all goes well I'd like it to be a permanent move.\" </p> <p>The Norway defender cost \u00a3400,000 when he arrived at Ewood Park seven years ago but was sold to United for \u00a35m in 1997. </p> <p>Coventry's manager Gordon Strachan has signed two Honduras internationals for undis closed sums. Jairo Martinez, a 21-year-old striker, and Ivan Guerrero, 23 and a midfielder, will arrive after representing their country at the Olympics. </p> <p>In the latest twist to the saga of the European Commission threat to the transfer system, the EC has confirmed that dialogue with football authorities will continue until the end of the year. \"We are particularly pleased with the confirmation given of a new timetable, with our ideas submitted by October 31 and a dialogue taken forward to December 31,\" said Per Omdal, Fifa vice-president and chairman of the task force set up to find a solution to the EU's legal challenge to the transfer regulations.</p>",
  "<p>Bill Clinton last night won a pledge from the world's biggest oil producer, Saudi Arabia, to halt the relentless rise in the price of crude which yesterday brought France to a halt and prompted fears of a global recession. </p> <p>As UK petrol firms responded to the 10-year-high in oil prices by putting up fuel prices by 2p a litre, crown prince Abdullah said Saudi Arabia would raise production by 700,000 barrels a day in an effort to ease pressure on the west. </p> <p>However, oil experts said the 3% increase in output would not be enough to bring crude oil prices to below $30 a barrel and motoring organisations warned that British drivers could soon expect to pay \u00a34 for a gallon of petrol. </p> <p>Speaking at the UN millennium summit in New York, President Clinton said he had put pressure on Saudi Arabia to take action ahead of Sunday's meeting of Opec - the 11-member oil producers' cartel. </p> <p>\"I told him I was very concerned that the price of oil is too high, not just for America but for the world,\" said Mr Clinton after his meeting with the crown prince. \"If it was to cause a recession in any part of the world that would hurt the oil producing countries.\" </p> <p>Large parts of France ran out of fuel yesterday as hauliers and farmers, more determined than ever to win big fuel tax cuts from the government, continued their four-day blockade of oil refineries and depots. </p> <p>Angry farmers, already active on most of the 120 blockades up and down the country, successfully blocked the entrance to the Channel tunnel with their tractors, triggering scuffles with British tourists. </p> <p>Around 50 British holidaymakers mounted a counter-blockade by blocking a lane being used by the authorities to allow French cars to trickle past the barricades, and threatened to cut off the main A16 motorway if they were not allowed to get through the blockade and go home. Under police escort, a convoy of British cars and coaches was eventually allowed through in the late afternoon. </p> <p>A British police sergeant, who was part of the convoy but asked not to be named, said: \"It seems we managed to outmanoeuvre them with a bit of British courage and some cunning. We played them at their own game and it worked. In the end it was quite a fun victory for all.\" </p> <p>Another convoy member, Frank Davidson, 49, said: \"This was as sweet a victory as Wellington over Napoleon at Waterloo. They didn't like it when we put up a fight.\" </p> <p>While talks resumed late in the afternoon between the French transport minister, Jean-Claude Gayssot, and the two main hauliers' federations, the government reiterated that it would go no further than the 15% tax cut, worth \u00a3100m, it offered on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the European commission threatened legal action if the free movement of goods within the EU was disrupted. </p> <p>As the protest spread, the hauliers, farmers, ambulance drivers and coach firms were joined by thousands of taxi drivers in massed \"go-slow\" processions that brought traffic to a halt in a dozen cities and caused motorway tailbacks. </p> <p>At least three regional airports reported they would be out of aviation fuel by this morning. Wholesalers at the main Rungis market outside Paris said supplies of fresh fruit and vegetable were beginning to be affected and 80% of the country's petrol stations were either dry, subject to rationing of \u00a315 per vehicle, or had been requisitioned for emergency service use only. </p> <p>In the financial markets yesterday, the price of a barrel of crude oil eased back from a peak of $34.50 to $33.91. However, dealers said that most of the Saudi production increase had been anticipated by the markets and that prices were not likely to fall markedly. </p> <p>They said Saudi Arabia was the key player in the crisis because it was the only Opec nation with the spare capacity to pump the extra oil needed to bring prices under control. But it can expect opposition from other Opec members who are enjoying extra revenues from the price surge from under $10 a barrel at the start of last year. </p> <p>Lawrence Eagles, oil analyst at the City firm GNI Securities, said a harsh winter could boost demand by an extra 500,000 barrels a day, pushing prices still higher.\"You can't rule out $40 a barrel if Opec aren't prepared to act,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p><strong>VAZ - WHAT IS HE GOOD FOR? </strong></p> <p>The other day the Fiver was at the airport, waving sarcastically as Leicester chairman John Elsom, Leicestershire East MP Keith Vaz and the FA's wonderful David Davies departed for Geneva, armed with only their immeasurable charm and a stack of \"collated information\" from the Foreign Office. Their mission was to persuade Uefa that Belgrade was bandit country, the sort of place that even hardened cowboys like Robbie Savage should avoid - especially on September 28th when Leicester were due to play Red Star Belgrade. And as we saw the airplane finally lift off the ground - which, with Mr Vaz on board, it did with some difficulty - the Fiver confidently predicted they didn't have a hope in hell.</p> <p>And - what do you know? - we were actually right. Well, sort of. Because today Uefa decided that the tie would still go ahead in Belgrade (home of bad man Slobodan Milosevic and a place the Foreign Office advises all Britons to avoid) but announced it will now be played a week earlier, thus avoiding all the civil unrest that's bound to kick off when President Milosevic wangles his way to an unpopular election win. Which is obviously a good thing.</p> <p>Or is it? Because Elsom didn't exactly perform triple salchows with pike at the news. \"We would have found Sofia an acceptable venue for this game as it is only four hours away from Belgrade, and Red Star played Montpellier there last year,\" he whined. \"Throughout my negotiations, the Foreign Office have been advising against non-essential travel to Yugoslavia, which implies there is some risk.\" But just as Balkan War II looked like being set into motion, Elsom relented: \"We certainly would not want to disobey a Uefa directive as that would mean being thrown out of the competition.\" Which means, we assume, that Savage will be let loose on Belgrade. Heaven help them.</p> <p><strong>PRICK UP YOUR EARS</strong></p> <p>The Fiver has only just recovered from the tinnitus caused by He Is Emmanuel Petit's year-long whine regarding his desire to leave Arsenal. So what's the first thing we are presented with the very second our poor battered ears have been nursed back to full health? That's right, an unbearable screeching sound sailing out of the very same man's mouth - and this time he's telling everyone that he never actually asked for a move at all. Gah! Why, we oughta ...</p> <p>\"I never expressed the wish to leave Arsenal,\" the pony-tailed Barcelona midfielder loudly honked in the general direction of France-Football magazine today. \"I was never asked my opinion - that's why I've fallen out with Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein. Instead, I was presented with a fait accompli. In the interest of everyone, that of Arsenal and of myself, I accepted a move - but it wasn't easy. In leaving I am losing friends.\" How selfless is that? What a great guy! And there was us thinking he couldn't get on the plane to Spain fast enough.</p> <p>Oh, hold on, we were right in the first place. \"I'm relieved above all to have finished with so-called English fair play. It's a utopia. They confuse fighting spirit with violence. The fault does not lie with the supporters, but certain younger players who take themselves for cowboys.\" The man with the reading collection of David Icke and the hair of Peter Stringfellow probably had a lot more to say for himself, but by this time we'd taped our ears up.

  "Bill Clinton's message to crown prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia was brief and to the point when they met yesterday. Unless the world's biggest oil producer shook some sense into the militant members of the Opec cartel, there was a risk of plunging the world economy into recession. <p>This week's Millennium Summit in New York has been the ideal time for some diplomatic arm-twisting, and the outgoing US president has taken full opportunity of the presence of 189 world leaders to spell out to the Saudis the consequences of turning up the heat on the big industrialised economies. </p> <p>With rising energy costs casting a shadow over Al Gore's election hopes, halting the relentless rise in the oil price to its highest level in 10 years has become a key policy objective in Washington. Nor did Mr Clinton need to look very far for a world leader to support him. Jacques Chirac was also at the United Nations summit to give a first-hand account of how France is grinding to a halt as a result of the protests at rising petrol prices. </p> <p>After years in the doldrums, Opec has now grabbed centre-stage once more. It is 27 years since the 11-nation cartel first came to public notice when its response to Israeli victories in the Yom Kippur war was to increase oil prices fivefold, triggering a period of stagflation - rising prices and lengthening dole queues - in the west. </p> <p>Over the past 18 months it has again been flexing its muscles, agreeing to curb production as world demand for oil rises. As motorists have found to their cost, the result has been a sharp increase in petrol prices at the pump. </p> <p>Prince Abdullah probably did not take much persuading at his meeting with Mr Clinton. The Saudis are well aware that a downturn in the west could cause a collapse in the oil price. Even so, they are likely to get some flak from other Opec members at the cartel's meeting in Vienna on Sunday, who say that the oil producers are being unfairly criticised for a problem caused by higher fuel taxes and refinery bottlenecks in the west. </p> <p>A chart on its website headed \"The rip-off race\" cheekily compares the prices of a barrel of oil, a barrel of Coca Cola and a barrel of Perrier water. Needless to say, it shows that oil is a bargain, though perhaps less thirst-quenching. </p> <p>Today, Opec has more muscle than ever before - at least in theory. Its share of worldwide production has increased from 36% to 41% over the last 10 years, and its share of proven reserves has increased from 67% to 78%. This trend, in the view of some analysts, is likely to continue. </p> <p>But Opec's ability to use this muscle is limited because its members - Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Venezuela - have divergent interests and its decisions have to be based on consensus. </p> <p>Oil-producing countries range from those which can barely produce enough for their own needs to those which are almost totally dependent on oil for their foreign exchange earnings. </p> <p><b> Dependent</b><br> </p> <p>The most dependent countries benefit from high prices but also need price stability. Drastic changes, up or down, hamper longer-term development and can mean re-drafting the national budget at short notice. Besides the Opec countries, Russia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Yemen, Oman and Mexico fall into this category. </p> <p>Julian Lee, analyst at the London-based Centre for Global Energy Studies, said yesterday that Sunday's discussions will not be about whether a production increase is needed, but by how much. </p> <p>\"It is all but certain that the situation will trigger an increase of 500,000 barrels a day, which will be fairly generally accepted,\" he said. \"But Saudi Arabia will push for a bigger increase - because it sees this as being in its own long-term interests and those of Opec generally.\" </p> <p>The Saudis are well-placed to do this because they hold about two-thirds of Opec's spare capacity which is estimated at 3m barrels a day. The Saudis would to some extent be shielded from a fall in oil prices by revenue from their extra production. </p> <p>But other Opec countries - Algeria, Iran, Libya, Nigeria and Venezuela - would lose money as a result of lower prices because they have little spare capacity. </p> <p>Venezuela, which currently holds the presidency of Opec, is at the forefront of the reluctant faction. At 3.1m barrels a day it is Latin America's largest producer - but almost totally dependent on oil. Each $1 drop in oil prices costs it about $1bn (\u00a3665m) a year. </p> <p>Its charismatic president, Hugo Chavez, has called an Opec summit in Caracas for later this month, and argues that the real issue is not high prices, but fair prices. </p> <p>\"We understand that they [consumers] start to feel uneasy when crude oil prices reach $30 a barrel, but they can imagine how it must have been for us when it fell to $8,\" he said recently. </p> <p>Coming at a critical moment in the Middle East peace process and in the midst of an American presidential election campaign, the argument over oil prices has acquired a political dimension. </p> <p>The Americans have been shouting more loudly than usual, and the perception that this was motivated, at least in part, by the electoral needs of the Democrats caused some resentment. </p> <p>Since then, the issue has been further complicated by American efforts to drum up support for its proposals on the Israeli-Palestinian issue. On the thorny question of Jerusalem, the Arab governments generally view the US as oversympathetic towards Israel. This is not a particularly good moment for Arab governments to be seen kow-towing to the Americans. </p> <p>Any decision to increase production will also have a built-in assumption that existing supplies will continue unabated. But with low stockpiles around the world, consumers have no real cushion against disruption of supplies from less dependable sources such as Iraq, Nigeria, Colombia and Angola.</p>",
  "When Adam Clymer's biography of Senator Edward Kennedy was published in the United States last year, it won respectful rather than dazzling reviews. <p>The last of the Kennedy brothers is a substantial subject in every way, and Clymer had obliged with a substantial volume, stretching to more than 650 pages.</p> <p>Reviewers praised the book as \"thoughtful and thorough,\" \"painstaking\" and \"at times pedestrian,\" which are not necessarily the sort of words that send publishers into raptures.</p> <p>This week, Clymer's name was in the news again. In a Labour Day gathering in a Chicago suburb, George W Bush turned to his running mate Dick Cheney and, thinking that the microphone was switched off, said to him: \"There's Adam Clymer from the New York Times - a major league asshole.\"</p> <p>Cheney replied: \"Oh, yeah, he is, big time.\"</p> <p>Bush's Labour Day blooper has been the talking point of the week and has been variously interpreted - to say nothing of variously reported (the Times buried the story in a news round-up and failed to quote Bush's words).</p> <p>One school of thought says that the overheard remarks show the real Bush, supposedly a much nastier fellow than the chirpy grin merchant with whom we are now so familiar.</p> <p>Another says, maybe so, but the remarks will do Bush nothing but good, since they provide proof that there is lead in his pencil.</p> <p>What the reporting has missed, though, is why Bush should have been moved to make his comments.</p> <p>As the reviews of his book about Ted Kennedy suggest, Clymer is not some fly-by-night chancer, trying to make a name for himself by baiting a top politician.</p> <p>On the contrary, Clymer is a veteran. He's been around nearly as long as Ted Kennedy himself.</p> <p>He appears to be an American journalist of the old school. He is a natural practitioner of the art of thoroughness - in the articles he writes in the Times just as much as in his book writing.</p> <p>Clymer hasn't spent much time this year on the campaign trail with Bush or anyone else. He has never been the Times's regular man on the campaign bus.</p> <p>Most of what he has written has been researched and from a distance; recently he has written a lot about the candidates' political advertising, and about the campaign finance issue.</p> <p>What he has also done, however, is to have penned one of the most damning articles about Bush to have appeared during the year. It was published in April, and it dealt with Bush's record on health policy in Texas. It began with this powerful indictment:</p> <p>\"Texas has had one of the nation's worst public health records for decades. More than a quarter of its residents has no health insurance. Its Mexican border is a hotbed of contagion.</p> <p>\"The state ranks near the top in the nation in rates of Aids, diabetes, tuberculosis and teenage pregnancy, and near the bottom in immunisations, mammograms and access to physicians.\"</p> <p>The article went on to point out that Texas's health record is a deeper problem than be laid at the door of any one politician, but it also explained that Bush has not tried to tackle it.</p> <p>Health has never been one of Bush's priority issues as governor. Though Bush makes much of his positive approach to Texas's Latino population, the health situation is worst in the state's most heavily Latino counties along the Mexican border - with disease rates \"at third world levels,\" Clymer wrote.</p> <p>It was hardly surprising that Clymer's article angered the Bush campaign, because it had a story to tell and because it highlighted an area of public policy of which Bush has a weak grasp.</p> <p>While Bush is confident when he deals with subjects like education and defence, he is noticeably less chipper on health issues.</p> <p>For much of the past 10 days, the Republican camp has been on the defensive about health policy, ever since Bush launched a campaign ad that claimed he would support extending a prescription drug benefit to retired Americans who are covered by the federal government's Medicare programme.</p> <p>How will it work and how much will it cost, Al Gore responded? Bush had to confess that he didn't know and that he was working on the details.</p> <p>In Pennsylvania on Tuesday, Bush finally filled in the gaps, announcing a $158bn programme (Gore would spend $253bn).</p> <p>But it had been a damaging week, knocking Bush off his own agenda. No wonder that the Democrats have despatched Joe Lieberman into enemy territory this morning to make a speech in Houston on Bush's health care record.</p> <p>Seen in this context, Bush's outburst against Clymer can be viewed as more than just another politician randomly abusing another journalist.</p> <p>It becomes a more specific and more significant story, of a journalist who has angered a politician by exposing his weakness on an issue that could make or break his presidential bid.</p> <p>In those circumstances, Bush's language was surprisingly restrained.</p> <p><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/\">Special report: the US elections</a></p>",
  "A Labour government chucks money at a lame duck. Fawlty Towers is named as the greatest British television programme of all time. The world holds its breath as petrol prices soar ahead of a meeting of Opec ministers in Vienna. There has been more than a whiff of the 70s in the air this week. It would only take Jacques Chirac to murmur \"Is there a crisis?\" on his return to France from the Millennium summit in New York and we would have the full set. <p>The blockades of refineries and fuel depots in France show that oil has lost none of its ability to cause economic and political waves since Opec's heyday a quarter of a century ago. Saudi Arabia's announcement yesterday that it would increase oil production by 3% came after quite blatant arm-twisting by Washington, but is almost certainly too little too late. Oil prices dipped slightly after the news, but in the short term, the increase will do little to correct the imbalance between demand and supply. Analysts believe that the price of a barrel of crude could hit $40 over the next few months, particularly if the rich countries of the north experience a hard winter. The \u00a34 gallon looms. </p> <p>According to devotees of the new weightless economy, none of this is much to worry about because the technological revolution of the past decade has made the global economy much less vulnerable to oil shocks than they were in the past. But governments in the west are right to be worried. Rising oil prices have meant big trouble three times in the past 30 years - in 1973, 1979 and 1990 - and they could very well spell trouble this time too. Since the start of 1999, global oil prices have increased almost fourfold, and are now starting to have an impact on economic activity. In the US, the higher cost of fuel is reining in the boom; in Europe it has pushed inflation above 2% and prompted the European Central Bank to raise interest rates. Japan, only just emerging from a 10-year recession, is especially vulnerable to higher energy costs. It would indeed be ironic if it was the symbol of the old economy that finally put paid to the overblown claims of the disciples of the new paradigm. </p> <p>Governments are also right to expect a backlash from both producers and consumers as business costs rise and living standards are squeezed. One reason the Clinton administration has been calling in favours with Saudi Arabia is the fear that dearer energy will cost Al Gore votes in November's election. In France, the Jospin administration has already felt the effects of the direct action by road hauliers which - in complete contrast to Britain's feeble \"dump the pump\" campaign - has paralysed large parts of the country and forced Paris to offer them concessions. </p> <p>In the end, however, this is not a rerun of the 70s and eventually prices will come down. As Sheikh Yamani - another blast from the past - warned Opec earlier this week, the recent surge in prices is probably the oil cartel's last hurrah. Why? Because higher prices will lead not only to the discovery and exploitation of new fields, but also the search for alternative energy sources. \"The stone age came to an end not for a lack of stones and the oil age will end, but not for a lack of oil,\" he said. </p> <p>Western governments could and should be doing more to hasten this process. To the extent that they have been levying ever-higher taxes on oil but refusing to recycle the proceeds into real investment in wave and solar power, they really have only themselves to blame if the voters turn nasty.</p>",
  "Either George Monbiot wrote his article on Conservative policy towards Nafta (Vote Tory for a federal superstate, September 7) before bothering to find out what our policy was, or he believes some very strange consequences indeed flow from free trade. Our policy is to support a free trade agreement between the EU and Nafta, to extend the free-trade zone across the Atlantic, as a prelude to global free trade by 2020. This was set out in our European election manifesto last year and it is the policy contained in our document Believing in Britain, published this week. <p>Such an arrangement would benefit not just Britain but the EU as a whole - and, indeed, it would also benefit the members of Nafta. Trade is the greatest engine of prosperity and progress there has ever been. A modern, outward-looking European Union would be embracing such policies with open arms. </p> <p>Conservatives believe that Britain does not have to choose between Europe and America. Britain is part of several overlapping and interlocking networks. Our membership of the EU and our transatlantic relationship are both vital to our interests and influence in the world.<br> <b>Francis Maude MP</b><br> Shadow foreign secretary<br></p> <p>\u0095 In contesting my article about the United Nation's relationship with big business, John Ruggie (Letters, September 4) insists that \"never has any president of the general assembly _ announced that businesses would be given a formal role in UN decision-making. The idea is preposterous.\" </p> <p>Well, it's certainly preposterous. But David Korten, a highly respected academic, was an observer at a meeting hosted by ambassador Razali Ismail, president of the general assembly, on June 24 1997. The president, he reported, announced \"that a framework for the involvement of the corporate sector in UN decision-making would be worked out under the auspices of the commission on sustainable development\". </p> <p>Soon afterwards, a leaked memo from Unctad (UN Conference on Trade and Development) revealed that such preposterous ideas were already being implemented: \"There is close cooperation with the ICC [International Chamber of Commerce] in helping countries to formulate competition and consumer protection law and policy.\" </p> <p>Mr Ruggie claims that the UN secretary-general \"did not launch the business humanitarian forum\". But Mr Annan wrote the speech with which the forum's first meeting began. Mr Ruggie insists that the forum is not co-chaired by the UN high commissioner for refugees. Indeed it isn't but, as I suggested, it was last year. He also insists \"no logo was developed\" for the UN Development Programme's pact with business. But a leaked document revealed the agency was envisaging \"a specially designed logo\" . Like the rest of scheme, it was dropped as a result of an outcry from activists all over the world.<br> <b>George Monbiot</b><br>Oxford</p>",
  "The chances of the US president, Bill Clinton, securing a Middle East peace settlement receded yesterday after the White House admitted he had failed to make any progress in talks at the UN millennium summit. <p>Mr Clinton held separate discussions with the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian president, Yasser Arafat, on the fringes of the summit. The White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said he could report no progress on the contentious issue of control of Jerusalem and that no further meetings were planned. </p> <p>Time is running out for Mr Clinton, with the US presidential election only two months away and Mr Barak's coalition government facing collapse next month. </p> <p>More pressing, Mr Arafat and his colleagues will meet this weekend to decide whether unilaterally to declare Palestinian independence on September 13, as they had threatened unless a deal was in place. The Palestinian delegation said the declaration could be delayed. </p> <p>Mr Clinton had been desperate to secure a Middle East settlement as the main legacy of his presidency. </p> <p>He met Mr Barak and Mr Arafat on the upper floor of the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in an attempt to see if there was a compromise that would complete the deal almost secured in July at Camp David. But White House officials said the positions had slipped back since then. </p> <p>Mr Arafat, in his speech to the millennium summit, took an uncompromising stance, declaring that Palestine should have sovereignty over Arab east Jerusalem, ditching the possibility of a compromise that might have seen the city share sovereignty or come under international control. </p> <p>Mr Arafat told the summit that the Palestinians had already made painful sacrifices for peace. </p> <p>An Israeli official said nothing could happen in the peace negotiations until Mr Arafat demonstrated he was ready to discuss ideas offered at or since Camp David. </p> <p>The public mood in Israel swung from anticipation to gloom yesterday after President Clinton failed to break the deadlock. </p> <p>The acting foreign minister, Shlomo Ben Ami, warned against over-optimism at the prospects of reaching a peace agreement while Mr Clinton remains in power. </p> <p>The mood darkened perceptibly as Israeli negotiators said there was no further room for manoeuvre with the Palestinians.\" We cannot be more flexible in our stances regarding Jerusalem,\" Gilead Sher, a negotiator, told Israel's army radio. </p> <p>Although the focus of negotiations since the collapse of the Camp David summit in July has been the status of Jerusalem, Mr Ben Ami emphasised that there were wide gaps between the two sides on refugees, as well as on less contentious issues like borders and settlements. \"We should not make the mistake of thinking that some symbolic compromise that Arafat agrees to on the Temple Mount solves the rest of the problems,\" he said.</p>"
