  "It's not often that pundits can say of an election \"it's too close to call\" like they're falling over themselves to say as the United States gets within a week of making its big choice: Al Gore or George W (Dubya) Bush. <p>Actually, that's not true. Pundits often resort to the \"too close to call\" when it isn't (ie usually). That's partly cowardice or caution, but it's also a pardonable desire to make a real horse race out of a contest in which they have invested time and money.</p> <p>What's the point of, say, the BBC's Peter Snow saying \"That's it, you can all go to bed now, the Tories have won again\" as he could have done around 1am on election night in 1992. That was when the result came in at Basildon, a key marginal which David Amess held.</p> <p>Of course, he didn't say that. The Snows of this world don't create ever-more-elaborate election swingometers in order not to use them. So Peter pundited frantically on into the night for politics junkies, while normal folk went to bed knowing that John Major had unexpectedly beaten Neil Kinnock.</p> <p>Unexpectedly? Throughout that campaign I would ask Tory strategists \"How are you going to get out of this one?\" They would reply, a touch smugly, \"tax and Kinnock\", a tribute to the Labour leader's lack of perceived gravitas and (people forget this bit) John Smith's shadow budget.</p> <p>I came to the reluctant conclusion they were right and made sure the Guardian carried a \"Late Surge Give Tories Hope\" headline on polling day. It didn't stop plenty of \"too close to call\" headlines elsewhere. </p> <p>In 1997 my run ended. Everyone knew Labour would win, but most of us (Blair, Major and Ashdown included) reckoned on the basis of the 1992 experience that there would be a last minute drift back to the Tories. Far from it. Blair got the landslide that has caused him trouble ever since.</p> <p>In the US this November it's the closest I can remember since 1992 when Ross Perot's third party \"Reform\" candidacy helped deliver the White House to Bill Clinton at Bush Sr's expense, just as Ralph Nadar's Green challenge threatens to do the same to Vice President Gore.</p> <p>You knew Bush would beat Dukakis in 1988, you knew Reagan would beat Fritz Mondale in '84 and your strong hunch was that he'd oust Jimmy Carter after the humiliation of the Iranian hostage drama in 1980, the result, history may confirm, of a dirty deal with Tehran. </p> <p>The same pattern is there in British elections. Margaret Thatcher's three victories in '79, '83 and '87 were wholly predictable. Labour's Gerald Kaufman called the '83 manifesto \"the longest suicide note ever written.\" </p> <p>Ted Heath's defeat in the \"miners' election\" of February 1974 was a surprise to many. I thought: \"If you ask a daft question like 'Who governs Britain?', voters will reply, 'Evidently not you, chum.\" Oddly enough, I had a hunch that Heath would win in 1970 too: Harold Wilson was too complacent.</p> <p>French and German elections have thrown up their share of excitement. De Gaulle fell on a referendum, Helmut Kohl hung on too long - 16 years - and ensured that his successor lost to the SPD's Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. When President Jacques Chirac tried to pull a stunt with early parliamentary elections in 1998 he lost badly and was forced to make socialist Lionel Jospin his prime minister.</p> <p>It was a costly error which may allow Jospin to beat him for the presidency next time. Conversely Al Gore's reluctance to deploy Clinton's campaign magic until this week - fear of the ''sleaze'' factor or vanity? - may cost him dear on Tuesday night.</p> <p>Americans are also picking one-third of their 100 senators and the whole 435-strong House. The Democrats will try (and fail) to regain control of both. One of the many pleasures of being a foreign correspondent in the US is that American journalists are generous to outsiders. They even hand over exit poll data which the TV networks are unable to publish themselves until all the polling stations on the west coast are closed - lest the polls influence how people vote in California, as they are said to have done in 1980. </p> <p>Reagan was winning in the east and Californians, more than most, like to back a winner. They did. The result is - or was when I was a Washington correspondent - that a British reporter, armed with exit polls not being reported on US TV, can make braver predictions about the results instead of resorted to our old friend \"Too close to call.\"</p> <p> The joy of the Bush-Gore contest is that it is a real horse race. Instinct tells me Bush is going to win because people like him more and he's neutralised the widely held view that he's both intellectually inadequate and in the clutches of big business. But, hey, anything could happen. One slip on the hustings, one bomb in Tel Aviv, could make a landslide either way. </p> <p>Back in 1960 Senator Jack Kennedy beat vice-president Richard Nixon by 100,000 popular votes, the closest election in modern times. As everyone knows, the Republicans believed the Democratic machine bosses stole the election, probably in Chicago, though Nixon gallantly declined to press the charge himself. I was a bit young then, but in 1986 I visited \"Gentleman Jim\" Dunn, chairman of Chicago's legendary Cook County Democratic machine on other matters.</p> <p>Cook County is to the Windy City what Middlesex used to be to London, the local authority for most of the capital. With no prompting from me Gentleman Jim, by now an elderly charmer, reached into his drawer and produced a copy of the Illinois election returns for November 1960.</p> <p>His purpose was to prove to a visitor that his team hadn't stolen anything because the voting patterns \"downstate\" in the Republican rural areas were the same as in the Democratic strongholds in the city. </p> <p>It proves no such thing. Once a political machine know how many votes are needed to turn a minority into a majority it can organise them as it pleases. Still it was a grand election with a result that will resonate down the ages. </p> <p>Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, they were all flawed giants in those days, operating with Shakespearean hubris. Oh really? Like \"too close to call\" that's just another pundit's clich\u00e9.</p>",
  "<p>Last week, Tony Blair finally made his first \"big green speech\" as prime minister. Sitting in the audience, I was reminded of popular singer Mariah Carey. His speech was technically proficient, artfully constructed, powerfully delivered - and devoid of soul. </p> <p>It's worth asking why Mr Blair has found it so difficult to connect with the environmental agenda, let alone with groups like Friends of the Earth (FOE), whose campaign against GM crops he huffily dismissed as the \"tyranny of pressure groups\". The roots lie in his political formation in the labour movement. Old Labour was a producerist tendency, there to defend the rights of workers and eradicate poverty through wealth redistribution. </p> <p>New Labour saw that modern societies required a more sophisticated approach. It spoke to and for employers as well as employees, and realised that people also consume goods and services. As good social democrats, New Labour believed scientific materialisation and economic growth were the cure for poverty. Environmentalism was at best seen as an eccentric sideshow, and at worst against business, against science and against the poor. </p> <p>These are myths. But Blair and his advisers have believed them. Hence, New Labour never embraced environmental priorities, and Blair has yet to deliver his election promise to \"put environmental concerns at the heart of policy-making\". </p> <p>Blair's speech contained a sharp and intelligent analysis of how environmental action is good for the economy and business. But if he genuinely \"wants to push green issues back up the political agenda\", he has a lot to do. </p> <p>First, he must recognise that sustainability really is the next big idea in politics. Political leadership on the environment now means working out how to replace free-market capitalism, as capitalism displaced communism. Environmentalists now know that humanity has to learn to live within ecosystem limits. </p> <p>Second, greens believe in fair shares of natural resources for everybody. If climate change places a limit on the safe production of greenhouse gases, then permitted emissions must be shared between north and south, with greater reductions in the north to help poor and vulnerable societies. </p> <p>Third, greens recognise the moral claims of future generations. Our consumption and development pressures must be restrained accordingly. </p> <p>It is easy to caricature these beliefs as anti-business. In private, this is indeed what Blair has said about environmentalists, particularly during the debates on global trade, the World Trade Organisation and GM foods (\"I am neither pro nor anti this technology\" said Blair last week, eyes darting around the room to see if his audience bought this remarkable assertion). In a classic and depressing New Labour spin operation before the big speech, Alistair Campbell briefed the media that his boss would be attacking green \"dogmatism\". Afterwards, other acolytes ran around denying any such intention. </p> <p>Blair is certainly a pragmatic politician. What his heart does not naturally understand, his head may be forced by events to apprehend. New Labour used to believe that the environment was of limited political importance, because the word itself never figured high up the list of focus group concerns. The awkward truth is that politicians who turn their backs on environmental problems find that they rise up and bite them hard in the bum. </p> <p>As New Labour learnt over GMOs, fuel taxes and rural issues, so in the US the Democrats are discovering similar political lessons for themselves. Al Gore faces defeat because of the insurgent campaign of the green Ralph Nader in crucial states like California. Gore and the New Clinton Democrats have only themselves to blame for Nader's appeal. Clinton also promised that the environment would be at the heart of government, and he did not deliver. </p> <p>In Europe, environmentalism has often found a voice in government because of proportional electoral systems and the consequent rise of credible green parties. But Britain's, or at least England's, arthritic political system makes this almost impossible. </p> <p>So what can Mr Blair do to turn his green problems around? </p> <p>First, he must produce a programme for Labour's second term that promotes radical green policies in every sector, from a dematerialisation of the economy, to organic and environmental farming, to granting fundamental environmental rights to all citizens. The usual bland pabulum produced by Millbank policy wonkers will not do. He must spell out targets and timetables, polluter tax programmes and recycled revenue spending. That is how to provide the environmental services and products that enable consumers to go green conveniently (which he said he wanted). </p> <p>Second, he must lead on the international stage, and help forge a partnership between north and south. In the climate debate, the most backward country is the US. Whether Gore or Bush wins, Blair should use Britain's \"special relationship\" to persuade the US to join Europe in implementing the Kyoto agreement. </p> <p>Finally, Blair must abandon the quaint notion that business will suddenly green itself. He pleaded with environmentalists to enter into partnership with industry, praising business leaders for their alleged environmental credentials. But FOE and other environmental groups already have constructive discussions with business leaders, even with companies who have been campaign targets for many years. That is part of successfully persuading business to change. Generally, industry does not welcome environmental initiatives. Having fought to replace environmental regulations with market mechanisms as their preferred policy approach, big business has sought to dismember every new environmental tax measure from the fuel duty escalator to the climate change levy. </p> <p>Blair drew attention to the huge and growing market in environmental goods and services, although he didn't mention that Britain lags behind Germany and Japan in market share. That will not change without vigorous government intervention, including regulation, legislation, taxation and public investment. </p> <p>Environmental issues are coming to dominate the political landscape, at home and internationally. For all Blair's idealistic talk about constructive partnerships, there is unlikely to be any cosy consensus over the way forward. Environmental politics has to be hard-ball politics, because it is about managing fundamental change. It means deciding how to curb the car, shift to green energy, ban unsafe synthetic chemicals, minimise wasteful consumption, sustainably harvest wild resources and regulate trade. That has to be the job of the government, because business and consumers will not do so unprompted. </p> <p>But the eventual prize is worth fighting for: a world where, as the prime minister put it, \"we can be richer by being greener, and by being greener we will enrich the quality of our lives\". FOE agrees. Only Blair and his peers have the power to make a sustainable world happen. They must provide the political leadership to ensure that it comes quickly.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Choosing a top dog</strong><br> </p> <p> Peter Melchett has sadly had enough of running Greenpeace UK and wants to grow his veggies and help stock Iceland's supermarket shelves as an environmental advisor. So who will take over that well-branded multinational? History usually dictates that a charismatic NGO leader is followed by a bit of dullard but the chirpy board and staff mood at Greenpeace (membership rising, court cases won, back in the public eye) is that a young radical communicator is needed. The hope seems to be that he or she will not take the organisation much further down the corporate route.</p> <p> The front runners are actually rather few. Insiders with a chance are Sarah Burton, the legal officer who has a long track record and Stephen Tindale, who started at Friends of the Earth, joined New Labour and is now back as Greenpeace's political officer. He is a new father, so his wife may not welcome the 75-hour weeks and occasional prison sentences. Elsewhere, Tony Juniper, number two at FoE, is a prime candidate who has made no secret of his desire to run a mainstream green group, and came close with the World Wildlife Fund. George Monbiot should also be on the list but no one ever offers him anything except libel writs and death sentences (and he is probably too radical for Greenpeace anyway). </p> <p> So could Greenpeace take the English football coach route and look abroad? Ute Bellier is German and was Greenpeace International's chair, but is thought to be far too happy in the Lake District running their forest campaign. Very long shots would be the Indian writers and activists Arundati Roy and Vandana Shiva who would be a dream double ticket, but would be far too much of a handful; which really only leaves Al Gore, Mo Mowlam, Jose Bove and Euan Blair. Odds are: 6-4 Juniper, 4-1 Tindale, 2-1 Burton, 7-1 Bellier, 25-1 Monbiot 1,000-1 Shiva, Roy, Gore, Bove, Blair. </p> <p><strong> Red/green alliance</strong><br> </p> <p> It's a frog. Specifically a red-thighed one having a snack before bedtime, as drawn by Ken Livingstone for London Zoo's Adopt an Animal week last week. Other celebs who contributed wildlife drawings include Frank Skinner and Dermot O'Leary. Others yet to contribute include T Blair, Z Ball and S Fry. </p> <p><strong> Blowing hot and cold</strong><br> </p> <p> Nature bites back. Several years ago that dearly beloved but deeply eco-ignorant author John Mortimer welcomed global warming because - eco-soundings paraphrases a bit here - it would bring nice warm weather to the south of England and all his friends could grow grapes in New Labour's chiantishire. Alas, the genial barrister was unable to push his new book on Monday because the massive storm stopped him reaching the BBC radio studios. No doubt Mortimer tuned in to hear leading British climatologist Dr Mike Hulme of East Anglia University warning that global warming actually meant similar storms could be expected far more frequently with far more deluges in ever heavier bursts throughout the Home Counties. </p> <p><strong> Changing times</strong><br> </p> <p> So, which shadow cabinet minister seven years ago chatted up young Euan Blair and unwittingly, according to his father, helped turn Tony Blair green? Step forward ... No. She really, really doesn't want it made public, perhaps because she keeps having alarming confrontations with ecologists and others who keep banging on about the environment. </p> <p><strong> Being prepared</strong><br> </p> <p> While storms lash Britain it is worth remembering that thousands of poor people die each year in climate disaster elsewhere. The Tearfund development agency in a report this week says disaster preparedness programmes have been proved effective. An early warning system in the Honduran city of La Ceiba saved all but nine inhabitants during Hurricane Mitch when 10,000 of the unprepared died elsewhere. Most crucial in planning is using local knowledge to create an early warning system, educating local communities so they can build in safe places, and mapping areas likely be affected so, for example, people can move to higher ground. Investing a few thousand pounds saves millions in subsequent relief. Of the 80,000 people who died in natural disaster last year 96% lived in developing countries.</p>",

  "<p>With the US presidential election still too close to call, <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Heston,+Charlton\">Charlton Heston</a> has rallied gun-owners across America with an apocalyptic speech denouncing Democrat candidate Al Gore as a threat to civil liberties and likening the contest to both the American Revolution and the Civil War. </p> <p>A long-time Republican, Heston was always expected to come out in favour of Texas governor George W Bush, but the sheer bombast of his language reveals how tense the contest has become in the final week before polling day.</p> <p>The Oscar-winning star of Ben Hur and The Ten Commandments was speaking at a rally in Wisconsin in his capacity as president of the National Rifle Association. \"Vote freedom,\" Heston urged the faithful. \"Vote George Bush. Everything else is a distant and forgettable second place.\" If Gore was elected, he claimed, American gun rights would be \"hammered into oblivion\".</p> <p>Heston went on to describe the contest as \"the most important election since the Civil War\" and compared the struggle to the war for independence (recently revisited in the Hollywood blockbuster The Patriot). \"Instead of fighting redcoats, we're fighting blue-blood elitists,\" he stormed.</p> <p>The right to bear arms is currently a crucial issue for a nation which sees some 30,000 deaths from handguns each year. If elected, Gore is expected to introduce tighter curbs on firearms. Bush, by contrast, recently approved legislation allowing people to carry a concealed weapon. </p> <p>One NRA activist is reported to have claimed that in the event of a Bush victory, \"the NRA will have an office in the White House\".

  "You could tell that New Yorkers must have been behind the Vanity Fair party held in Los Angeles this week to launch their glossy coffee table book on Hollywood. <p>Not only were people smoking openly but young waiters and waitresses hovered on hand with free cigarettes and ashtrays. Since smoking in California is regarded as morally somewhere between spousal abuse and seal culling, this was no small deal. </p> <p>The book is full of spectacular photos by people like Annie Leibovitz, Edward Steichen and Herb Ritts and a commentary by the former British matinee idol, Christopher Hitchens. The only jarring note amidst the pictures of everyone from Louise Brooks to Jennifer Lopez is a spread of Rupert Murdoch who is allowed to bestride two pages of Vanity Fair's Hollywood between Jean Harlow and Paul Newman on the grounds that he \"raised the Titanic to blockbuster status; ditto the mammary gland in Fleet Street.\" </p> <p>A reminder of the true spirit of Hollywood could be glimpsed from the lawn of the house where the bash was held: a silhouette of the Observatory in Griffith Park where the famous scene in Rebel Without a Cause was shot. The house belongs to screen writer Mitch Glazer and actress Kelly Lynch. According to an article in the LA Times this week, Glazer is one of 17 - that's seventeen - writers credited with the script of the new film, Charlie's Angels, based on the old TV series. </p> <p>Amongst the guests, as they say, were Jackie Collins, Sheryl Crow, Tony Curtis, George Hamilton, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Lisa Kudrow, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Alan Cumming, Jacqueline Bisset and Dominick Dunne who wrote in the book that the \"old-time glamour\" of Hollywood is back. </p> <p>Alas, the party was not the one that has been making the headlines in Los Angeles this week. That event took place not far away in Benedict Canyon and was also at a lovely home, known as The Castle, and attended by actors. It was a Halloween party thrown by the bunch of young guys who owned the house and police were called early last Saturday morning by neighbours complaining about the noise. </p> <p>What exactly happened when police arrived is still the subject of an investigation but a 39-year-old actor, Anthony Dwain Lee, one of the many guests in costume, supposedly pointed a replica gun from inside the house at one of the officers. The officer then shot him dead. </p> <p>Lee, who was in such films as Buffalo Soldier and Liar Liar and is due to appear in recorded editions of ER, was, according to friends, a peaceful soul. Perhaps he thought that the police were just other guests dressed as cops. Whatever, he is dead now, another statistic in the grim catalogue of gun deaths in the US. </p> <p>On that subject, Charlton Heston, who was not at the Vanity Fair party, has been working hard this week for the election of George W Bush, the choice of the National Rifle Association which Heston heads. This week Heston said that Gore would be the worst president ever for gun owners and warned NRA members that a \"holy war\" was underway to deprive them of their right to carry arms. </p> <p>In the meantime, Anthony Dwain Lee is dead, another victim of the unholy war of a gun culture from which the firearms industry profits so handsomely. No chance for him to find a place for himself in the next edition of Vanity Fair's tribute to Hollywood.</p>",
  "The American presidential election and the Danish referendum on the single currency may not seem to have much in common, but together they are posing some historic choices for Britain. Whether it is Al Gore or George W Bush who wins next week, America looks set to loosen its ties with Europe. At the same time, partly as a result of Denmark's devastating referendum, Europe is fractured and directionless as never before. <p>For decades Britain has positioned itself as a mediator between Europe and America. The risk today is that it will be left stranded between them. The United States is the world's only truly global power, its hegemony more complete than any in modern history. America's military and technological might is such that no state can come anywhere close to challenging it in the foreseeable future. Yet it is possessed by insecurity. After a decade of sustained interventionism, the world has not been made over in America's image. The conflicts of the Balkans and the Middle East have proved resistant to American power and idealism. The American public is discovering that the post-cold war world is a dangerous and intractable place. </p> <p>Hence its fascination with national missile defence (NMD), the scheme for a hi-tech shield against attack by rogue states. Across the whole spectrum of foreign and defence policy, America is tilting towards unilateral action in defence of its national interest. As Hugo Young has noted, George Bush's chief foreign policy advisor, Condoleeza Rice, has called for the withdrawal of American forces from Kosovo and Bosnia - seemingly ignorant of the fact that more than 80% of the peacekeeping forces are provided by European countries. </p> <p>Baffled by the intractability of the world, and angered by its stubborn resistance to American values, a substantial section of American opinion is turning inwards. Utopian rhetoric about worldwide democratic capitalism is being replaced by the more pragmatic project of globalisation in one country. The internationalist perspective that framed American foreign relations from the second world war right through the Clinton era is being steadily superseded by a single-minded focus on America's strategic interests. This tilt to unilateralism may be accentuated if Dubya Bush wins the White House, but it will not be altered if Al Gore takes the crown. In future, as in the past, America's relations with the rest of the world are likely to be shaped by the imperatives of trade, oil and old- fashioned geopolitics. </p> <p>America's turn to realpolitik need not be all bad. The world may be reverting to an international system more like that of the 19th than the 20th century, in which wars were fought over interests, not ideologies. A more introverted and self- regarding America is not without risks, but American policies are better shaped by the limited imperatives of national interest than by the unending demands of ideology. Even so, this shift in American thinking is taking place at an awkward time. </p> <p>The Danish referendum has shattered forever any prospect of the European Union coming together as a whole to form a federal state. There can be no more talk of a multi-speed Europe - a metaphor which suggests that all EU members are travelling to the same destination. The EU is already multidirectional. France and Germany may be bent on closer union, but it is clear that several member states will not follow them - above all Britain. There is now no way a referendum on Britain joining the euro can be held and won in Labour's second term - and if not then, when? In truth, there is now little prospect of Britain ever joining the euro. </p> <p>It is not only that the hostility of British voters to the euro has rarely been more pronounced. More, the euro's continuing weakness is revealing deep-seated flaws in the European project. Can anyone be sure that, sometime over the next 10 or 20 years, opposition to the single currency will not grow in influence in France and Germany? How can anyone be sure the euro will still exist 20 years from now? </p> <p>British voters' increasingly immovable hostility to the idea of deeper integration with the EU cannot be explained chiefly by the Blair government's timorous refusal to engage the issue. It is a reasonable response to the demonstrated failings of European institutions. </p> <p>Outside the wilder fringes of the Tory party, few people seriously entertain the idea of Britain leaving the EU. Equally, however, there are few who can now be persuaded that it is in Britain's interest to opt for deeper integration. </p> <p>Yet the halfway house, between the US and Europe, may soon cease to be viable. With France and Germany coming together in an experiment in top-down, post- democratic federalism and the US withdrawing from Europe in order to defend its national interests unilaterally, the risk for Britain is that it may be left in a no man's land. A choice is shaping up for Britain for which voters and the political classes seem wholly unprepared. </p> <p> John Gray is professor of European thought at the LSE.

  "<p>The Yugoslav president, Vojislav Kostunica, yesterday offered to hold talks with Ibrahim Rugova, the victor in Kosovo's first democratic election, whose party is committed to independence.</p> <p>But Mr Kostunica coupled his proposal with a warning that the Kosovo Albanian drive for independence \"would be dangerous for stability in the region\".</p> <p>There was no immediate reaction from Mr Rugova to the suggestion of talks.</p> <p>Kosovo is still nominally part of the Yugoslav republic of Serbia, although Nato-led forces drove Serbia's forces out of the province last year.

He beat the hard-line nationalists, the PDK (the Democratic Party of Kosovo), led by Hashim Thaci.</p> <p>Mr Kostunica, who last week called for the Kosovo election to be postponed, said on a visit to Norway yesterday: \"I am open to all sorts of contacts with Albanian leaders.\"</p> <p>He hinted he was happier that Mr Rugove rather than Mr Thaci had won: \"What is good about these elections is the fact we have a clear picture\" of the strongest Albanian political forces in Kosovo, adding they had been led by \"the more moderate political force that is the party of Ibrahim Rugova\".</p> <p>While Mr Rugova intends to pursue discussions with Belgrade at some point, it would be politically risky for him to do so too early because it would open him up to criticism from nationalist hardliners.</p> <p>Mr Rugova was criticised during the war after appearing on television in talks with the former Yugoslav dictator Slobodan Milosevic while Serbian paramilitaries, backed by Serbia's army and police, were committing atrocities against Kosovo Albanians.</p> <p>Mr Kostunica described the election result as \"mono-ethnic\" because it was contested almost exclusively by Kosovo Albanian parties committed to independence.

  "\"Don't judge my heart,\" George W Bush scolded Al Gore when the vice president questioned his record as Texas governor. Mr Gore retreated, insisting he meant to do nothing so personal. But Lydia Camarillo would not have held back. For her, it is personal. <p>Mrs Camarillo is in an unusually good position to judge the quality of Governor Bush's compassion. She lives in the colonias, the Hispanic shanty towns clustered in the Rio Grande Valley. It is the poorest corner of the nation, from where the warm, fuzzy campaign talk about the governor's much-vaunted heart and his concern to \"leave no child behind\" seems, at best, surreal. </p> <p>Viewed from here, Texas is a harsh state of extreme inequality, which has become more unequal under Mr Bush's leadership. In a time of booming economy and record budget surpluses, the governor's corporate allies have made a killing at the lucrative intersection of state government and business. Meanwhile 45% of the population in the lower Rio Grande Valley live below the poverty line and pray that they never need medical help they cannot afford. It is an unforgiving place, unrecognisable from the progressive and tolerant state evoked in Mr Bush's stump speeches. </p> <p>The governor's powers are strictly circumscribed by the state constitution, but with less than a week potentially separating Mr Bush from the White House, his priorities and policies as Texas governor give clear indications about how he might lead America. </p> <p>Mrs Camarillo views him as a negligent, absentee landlord. She points out that he has never even been to a \"colonia\" with its mostly Mexican-American population. In his five years as governor, Mr Bush has been to the border region only a handful of times, for \"photo-opportunities\". But unlike all his recent predecessors, he has never strayed into the huddled grids of dirt roads and shacks, so he cannot have smelt the dizzying odour of a thousand pit latrines and septic tanks when the rain begins to fall. </p> <p>\"When it floods it brings up all that stuff,\" Mrs Camarillo said. \"It rises up and gets into people's houses.\" </p> <p>When her son, Robert, fell ill with bronchitis she hesitated before taking him to see a doctor because she had no health insurance. When his condition became serious, she panicked and rushed him across the Rio Grande, to the Mexican border town of Reynosa. \"The doctor there said if I had been just a few hours later, he would have been dead.\" </p> <p>Lydia Camarillo's plight is not unusual. There are 1.4m uninsured children in Texas, a higher proportion than anywhere else in the country, be cause Texas, under Mr Bush's governorship, makes it harder than any other state to get affordable healthcare. Lydia and her husband, Belarmino, have no steady jobs. She bakes cakes and sells them from home, and the family migrates northwards in the summer to work as agricultural labourers. </p> <p>But the Camarillos' most prized possession, a pick-up truck, is valued at over $2,000 (about \u00a31,380), which is enough to disqualify them from Medicaid, the government funded free healthcare scheme. They are considered too \"wealthy\". </p> <p>This was an issue to which the governor gave unusually detailed attention. His administration blocked the adoption of a national child health insurance programme (Chip), which offers affordable care to families just above the absolute poverty level. Although the scheme is funded entirely by the federal government, Mr Bush argued that 20% of the applicants \"will come in seeking Chip but will be enrolled in Medicaid instead\", and that would have to be paid out of his state budget. In plain English, he was afraid poor Texan families would find out what free medical care they were entitled to. His administration fought an attempt to put it on the state legislative agenda in 1997. Instead, he spent much of the state's $6.4bn on tax-cuts, including a $1bn cut in property taxes. Under increasing duress last year, he suggested a more limited scheme which would have excluded 200,000 children, before giving in to political pressure. </p> <p>\"On Chip, he was no good at all. He had to be dragged into it kicking and screaming,\" said Ernesto Cortes, a leader of the local community action group, Valley Interfaith. </p> <p>In his standard presidential campaign appearances, Mr Bush now claims credit for the Chip scheme, which has evolved into an essential element of his bipartisan \"compassionate conservative\" image. </p> <p>It is spin of Orwellian boldness. It is still tougher in Texas than in almost any other state to gain access to Medicaid. And in a region where the per capita income is $7,700, less than half the Texas average, the Bush administration in 1997 actually attempted in 1997 to lower the minimum wage of $3.25 an hour. </p> <p>Mr Bush's governorship has overseen a steady deregulation of business, at the expense - his critics argue - of the individual. Nowhere is this clearer than in tort reform, the central plank in Mr Bush's election campaigns in 1994 and today. </p> <p>Crudely put, the law limits the ability of courts to inflict punitive damages on negligent businesses. It would, Mr Bush promised, curb the spread of \"junk lawsuits\" by avaricious lawyers aimed at extorting money out of innocent firms. </p> <p>But tort reform also affected people like Donna Hall, whose husband Charles was killed in 1996 in an explosion at a refinery in Amarillo, at the opposite end of Texas. He had repeatedly complained about the state of the valves, but the management had neglected to carry out maintenance work. A jury imposed $42.5m in punitive damages on the refinery, Ultramar Diamond Shamrock, but under the tort reform laws, a judge unilaterally reduced the award to $200,000, barely enough to cover the cost of taking the firm to court. </p> <p>Once again, where there were losers, there were also winners - in this case the company. The legislation also restricted claims on Texas insurance companies, who, according to the Centre for Economic Justice in Austin, made $3bn in windfall profits as a result. The insurance industry has subsequently been a significant contributor to the Bush presidential campaign. </p> <p><b> Most polluted</b><br> </p> <p>On the other end of the winner-loser scale are JR and Lupe Cordova. The couple live in Houston, which last year overtook Los Angeles as the most polluted city in the nation. As a focal point of the petro-chemical industry, it has always been a dirty town, but from where the Cordovas stand, it has got a loss worse. </p> <p>Perched on the Houston Ship Channel, their neighbourhood, which goes by the ironic name of Woodland Acres, has been suffocated by the seemingly unregulated industrial sprawl around them. A steel firm called North Shore Supply Company built a galvanising plant across the road from them, despite zoning regulations defining the street as residential. Despite the family's complaints, those regulations have never been enforced, and the plant continues to add to the burden of chemicals and black dust in the air. By their own accounting, Houston industries pump nearly a million tonnes of pollutants into the air each year in \"accidental\" chemical releases. The condition of the air alone is estimated to cause nearly 1,000 deaths in Houston a year. </p> <p>The Cordovas' son Stephen, 10, has chronic bronchitis and, like his father, a near-permanent rash which turns the skin on his arm red and tough. At elementary school, he would vomit after every meal. Their daughter Jessica, 15, had such severe asthma that she was unable to go outside for more than 20 minutes at a time. \"My daughter tells her version of our life together. It's all seen from inside looking through the window at us outside,\" Mrs Cordova said. </p> <p>Mr Cordova developed severe sinus and respiratory problems and had to leave his job as a docker on the channel, but he still wanted to stay in the blighted neighbourhood he had grown up in. But, the Cordovas were forced out of Woodland Acres anyway. </p> <p>After Mrs Cordova, a schoolteacher, became prominent in a campaign by local mothers to force national environmental standards on the local industries, the couple began receiving death threats. In November 1999, someone blew the windows out of their car with a shotgun. That was too much, and the family moved to a suburb in north Houston earlier this year. They have yet to find jobs there and they are unable to sell their house in Woodland Acres. North Shore Supply offered $14,000, and Mr Cordova angrily turned them down. </p> <p>As far as the Cordovas are concerned, Mr Bush is entirely responsible for their plight. \"George Bush had the authority to do something about it, and he did nothing,\" Mrs Cordova said. </p> <p>The environment is one area where the Texas governor does wield almost absolute power. He is responsible for appointing the three members of the state regulatory board, the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission (TNRCC). Mr Bush, whose 1994 election campaign was sponsored largely by oil and petrochemical companies, appointed three men with close ties to Texas industry under the chairmanship of a former lobbyist for the chemical and genetic engineering giant, Monsanto. There were no representatives from environmental or consumer groups. If he becomes president, environmentalists are concerned he will do the same to the Environmental Protection Agency, whose intrusion in Texas affairs he has noisily resented. </p> <p>Under agency pressure to do something about the loopholes in the state's environmental laws, the TNRCC held closed meetings in 1996 with executives from the petrochemical industry and came up with a voluntary compliance scheme, with no penalties and a long grace period. </p> <p>The law did little for Houston's atrocious air quality. But, like many of Mr Bush's policies as governor, it did a lot for his political viability. The companies which were given the opportunity to draft the law donated $1.5m to the governor's 1998 re-election campaign and, according to the Texan environmental group, Public Research Works, they have given $1.1m to his presidential effort. </p> <p>\"That is what he did as governor, what is he going to do as president?\" Mrs Cordova wanted to know. \"If he's going to lead the country the same way, where are we going?\" <br> <b> Where Texas ranks in the states </b><br> </p> <p>Number of executions 1st </p> <p>Uninsured children 1st </p> <p>Most polluted city (Houston) 1st </p> <p>Ozone emissions 1st </p> <p>Public health spending 47th </p> <p>State government spending 50th </p>",
  "What's at stake in this election? More than you think. Despite the near-universal perception of next week's US presidential race as a beauty contest - \"It's a choice between a moron and a prick,\" says one Gore aide - much more hangs on Tuesday's decision than who gets to smile for the cameras on Wednesday. The reverberations from this battle will pulse through America for the next four years. And not just America. Britain, and especially the Labour party, will feel the impact of this squeaker of a race. <p>The US electorate should have no doubt as to what hangs on their decision. But, such are the talents of George W Bush and Al Gore, the voters still seem far from clear. For many, the two candidates are barely distinguishable on the issues - hence the emphasis on personality. That's a tribute to Bush's strategy of \"hugging\" Gore on policy - allowing the Democrat no real advantage on education or healthcare, for example- and a testament to Gore's timidity. The vice president has not dared mention the real differences between him and W, for fear of alienating the undecideds who will determine this contest. </p> <p>So he rarely utters a word about abortion rights, one of the few areas where the next president will be decisive. Whoever wins will appoint perhaps three or four new judges to the nine-member Supreme Court, replacing those due to retire. The current bench supports the 1973 Roe v Wade decision guaranteeing a woman's right to choose - but only by a knife-edge margin of five to four. Bush would appoint conservative, anti- abortion judges and, within a couple of years, the United States would become a land where no pregnancy can be legally terminated. Gore would uphold the 1973 right. Tuesday's poll is a referendum on abortion - but it suits neither candidate to say so. Bush does not want to alienate suburban women who support choice, and Gore is panicky about rural conservatives who oppose it. But ignore the silence: this election matters. </p> <p>Or reflect on one of the fatal flaws of American society: its love affair with the gun. In America 10 children or teenagers die from firearms every day, with 30,000 people of all ages killed a year. A Gore administration might propose an owners' registration system or a child-proof mechanism on the trigger (like those on any bottle of pills). But expect no action from President W. In Texas he approved legislation allowing people to carry a concealed weapon anywhere - including into a church or synagogue. One activist for the National Rifle Association, the gun lobby headed by Charlton Heston, has bragged that if W wins \"the NRA will have an office in the White House\". The candidates don't want to talk about it: Gore is anxious not to scare off gun owners in must-win states such as Pennsylvania or West Virginia. But the division is there. </p> <p>On the terrain where the candidates are most up-front the choice is just as plain. Voters can go for Bush's plan to blow the current surplus bonanza on a mix of spending programmes and a juicy tax cut, or they can plump for Gore who offers no such tax reduction. An independent forecast says the Bush scheme would see the surplus swallowed up by 2012, plunging America back into deficit. Interest rates would head back up and the good times would be over. That's the choice. </p> <p>There's also a subtler decision to be made on Tuesday. For there is more to the presidency than making laws: it's also a social, even a cultural job. </p> <p>A president is not a prime minister. Head of government is only one of his duties; he also has to serve as leader of the American tribe and virtual father to the nation. Only this explains the reverence shown to past presidents, the enshrining of their papers in well-funded libraries, the enduring interest in the lives of a Kennedy or Roosevelt. </p> <p>This role, easily overlooked, is also on the line next week. Whoever wins will set the cultural tone for the nation. Just think of Bill Clinton's impact: future generations will see his as the iconic face of the 1990s, representing not just politics, but the entire spirit of the times. </p> <p>This is the role scholar Fred Greenstein, in a new book, The Presidential Difference, calls \"preaching and teaching\". It is central to the office. If Gore takes the nation's \"bully pulpit\" his sermons would be dull, but they would at least address the big questions of the present and future, from the internet to the environment. </p> <p>But what if Bush becomes America's high preacher? What mood would his presence create? The Dubya era would probably feel like the moment when the US decided to shy away from the future, to retreat into comfortable simplicities personified by a man who revelled in his lack of sophistication. It would herald America's stepping back from the scariness of the 21st century, opting instead for the plaid-shirt cosiness of a high-born Forrest Gump. </p> <p>We would get caught up in that undertow, too, just as we have lived through the Clinton era. But we would also feel a more direct effect, most immediately on foreign policy. A Bush White House would be keen to turn away from Europe, to distance itself from Clinton's efforts in the Balkans and Northern Ireland and to focus instead on Latin America. </p> <p>A secondary impact will be on the modern brand of special relationship, the one that's really mattered this last decade: the bond not so much between Britain and the US, as between Labour and the Democrats. If Gore loses, the Clinton-Blair partnership in power will be broken: one half of the transatlantic couple would suddenly be in the cold. </p> <p>Besides the PR blow - and the inevitable perception that the global centre-left's glory days are over and that low-tax, small-government conservatism is back - there would be a more substantive problem. Labour has borrowed much from its Clintonian cousins, whether Jack Straw's teenage curfews or Gordon Brown's working families tax credit. That transfer was easy when the American ideas were coated in the shiny gloss of electoral success. But why adopt them when they're tainted with failure? How easy would it be for Brown, an enthusiast for the American system, to persuade the Labour party to look west if the US becomes Bush country once more? </p> <p>The response is already being prepared. One of the human linchpins to the Labour-Democrat relationship told me yesterday that the modernisers, both here and in America, will simply argue that Gore's defeat came because \"he went too far to the left, he became too associated with 'big government'.\" The lesson New Labour wants to learn from Gore's struggle is that, \"you have to hold the centre\". </p> <p>But these are arguments Labour would rather not have to make. It would like Tuesday to bring the vindication of a fresh mandate for the progressive project. Americans need not busy themselves with such concerns next week; they have motives of their own for voting. For, despite appearances, much is at stake. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com\">jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Alarm bells are ringing within the Democratic party as the US presidential race enters its final week. All but one of six national tracking polls show Al Gore trailing his Republican rival, George W Bush. After months of ups and downs, the past three weeks have shown Mr Bush maintaining a slim but steady advantage. The picture in key states like California, Florida and Michigan is more confused, changing almost day by day. But the impression has been gained that, of the two, Mr Gore is the more likely loser. Britain's bookies see it that way: Ladbroke's was quoting Bush at 13-8 on yesterday, with Gore at 6-5 against. If the theory that floating voters prefer to back the winning side holds true and the Democrats fail to turn out key voting blocs, like blacks and Hispanics, next Tuesday's result may not even be that close. <p>All bets will be off in the event of a late Gore surge, which some pollsters claim even now to detect in nine swing battlegrounds. But as Democratic nerves jangle, Mr Gore is increasingly campaigning against the backdrop of an internal inquest, a sort of antedated postmortem, his eviscerated cadaver still a-quivering on the operating table of opinion. He has failed to connect with voters, say the despairing spin doctors, scanning their charts and graphs. His body language is unintelligible, his alpha male traits too aggressive and inflated. According to assorted poll pathologists, he has blown the suburban women's vote, the youth vote, the Arab vote, the Catholic vote, even the Dubya-gets-my-goat vote. The Greens are his nemesis: if Bush does not dish him, then Nader's Raiders will. For all those Tipper kisses, the scales are tipping and his grip is slipping. </p> <p>Much of this is vapouring, of course, mere election-eve hyperventilation in a race that remains too close to call. Mr Gore's failings as a candidate are more than matched by his opponent's vacuity. Yet in all the pre-match analysis, one crucial Gore handicap has been consistently underplayed. It can be summed up in three words: William Jefferson Clinton. </p> <p>For a significant number of registered independents, the undecided voters who may swing the election, Mr Clinton's name is best not mentioned. While they usually agree that the president has done a good job, that consideration is outweighed by memories of his personal perfidy. Mr Gore has tried to distance himself from puerile Oval Office carry-on. But his close, eight-year association with the man who dilly-dallied into impeachment is hard to erase, especially with Mr Bush regularly alluding to the Clinton scandals and questioning the Democrat's own credibility. Mr Gore's understandable, necessary need to portray himself as his own man, and not the creature of his more famous master, has also inhibited his campaign strategy. His strongest card is the long, unbroken spell of prosperity since he took office as vice-president in 1993. But some leading Democrats complain that Mr Gore has failed fully to exploit this core achievement for fear of once again subordinating himself to the leader whose shadow he must escape. Instead of celebrating the past, he focuses on the future - which suits the arriviste Bush just fine. </p> <p>Above all, as a campaigner, Mr Gore suffers by comparison with Clinton, king of the stump. Although the president has no equal as a get-out-the-vote man, Mr Gore had barred him from the fray. That he has now swallowed his pride, taken the risk, and called up Mr Clinton in California is a true measure of his party's alarm. If Big Al wins, Bumptious Bill will try to claim credit. If he loses, the Clinton factor will figure in the autopsy.</p>",
  "Where does Britney Spears outrank the Pope, Slobodan Milosevic get more space than the Queen, and JK Rowling beat Yasser Arafat hands down? The answer, according to a survey published today, is in the column inches of Britain's national newspapers. <p>Tony Blair is the man given the most column inches this year, 43,890, just ahead of his friend/rival - depending on which paper you have been reading - Gordon Brown. Despite calls to respect their privacy, the prime minister's family have not done too badly either. Euan Blair's unfortunate getting-to-know-you session with the pavement in Trafalgar Square has elevated him above that other well known hellraiser, Mick Jagger. </p> <p>But not even Euan's night out could put him ahead of the newest member of the Blair dynasty, baby Leo, who gained more column inches than the Pope. Not that too much should be read into that: so did Robbie Williams, Madonna, and even Anthea Turner. </p> <p>Slobodan Milosevic, Yugoslavia's former president, made a late run to appear sixth in the list of personalities obsessing the press, in front of the big two presidents, Bill Clinton and Vladimir Putin, at eight and 19 respectively. Despite the Middle East crisis, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is in 49th place, below the author of the successful Harry Potter books, JK Rowling. </p> <p>Considering the coverage devoted to her 100th birthday it is hardly surprising the Queen Mother is the favourite royal, though not far ahead of Prince William and his gap year. No doubt the Queen and Prince Charles will consider 2000 to have been a bad year, amassing 13,102 inches between them, fewer than the Tory leader, William Hague. </p> <p>Catherine Ostler, UK editor of PeopleNews.com, which published the list, said: \"The list reflects all our national obsessions - politics, sport, pop music, royalty - but it's interesting to see just how much we read about whom. </p> <p>\"Would you have guessed that Euan Blair has had more coverage than Catherine Zeta Jones?\"</p> <p><b>The write stuff in 2000</b></p> <p><b>Tony Blair</b> 43,890 </p> <p><b>Gordon Brown</b> 20,638 </p> <p><b>William Hague</b> 16,112 </p> <p><b>The Queen Mother</b> 13,218 </p> <p><b>Prince William</b> 9,259 </p> <p><b>Slobodan Milosevic</b> 8,585 </p> <p><b>Al Gore</b> 8,217 </p> <p><b>Bill Clinton</b> 7,988 </p> <p><b>Cherie Blair</b> 7,696 </p> <p><b>The Queen</b> 7,602</p>",
  "Generally, I am sceptical about conspiracy theories. However, I feel the current furore in the Muslim world about western media coverage of events in the Middle East is justified. <p>First, I watched horrified as Israeli soldiers shot, in cold blood, Mohammad al-Durra, a 12-year-old Palestinian boy. His father tried to shield his cowering son while begging the assassins in vain to hold fire. Equally shocking was the senseless killing of the Palestinian ambulanceman who then arrived. I watched this scene on several news channels and all reported that the boy was caught in crossfire. This was blatantly untrue and the captured images showed clearly that the firing was one-sided and unprovoked. The Palestinians claim that father and son innocently went shopping to Gaza. Israel claims they were violent protesters. But even if they were, since when did the hurling of rocks warrant gunfire? </p> <p>I was equally appalled by TV images five years ago when a Palestinian suicide bomber blew up a restaurant in Israel packed with children, but the difference is that those reporting the blast were as outspokenly horrified as I was by the images of mutilated children's bodies. </p> <p>In this case, however, far from condemning the brutal public execution of a young boy, I was amazed to read the western press condemning Palestinians for \"sending their children out to die\" for the sake of \"scoring media points\". That doesn't explain the shooting of an 18-month-old baby girl in the back seat of her father's car. Or how another 12-year-old boy was shot in his own garden. </p> <p>Then two Israeli soldiers were filmed being brutally killed by Palestinian protesters. It made shocking viewing. The news channels reiterated the Israeli claim that they had mistakenly \"strayed into Ramallah\". Yet Ramallah is a city under total Israeli military siege and is completely blockaded except for one entrance, which is entirely under the control of Israeli military checkpoints. They were clearly undercover hit squad agents who had deliberately infiltrated a funeral march. They were recognised, and although Palestinian police attempted to protect them, the furious mob invaded the police HQ and killed them in full view of the international media. </p> <p>This was presented immediately as justification for subsequent Israeli aerial attacks, and increased block ades. No one can condone the frenzied killing of these two Israeli soldiers and the perpetrators will certainly be called to account - unlike the soldiers responsible for killing the 12-year-old Palestinian boy. </p> <p>But why did Madeleine Albright present her immediate condolence to the families of these two Israeli soldiers, when more than a fortnight has passed without any such comments for the families of the dozens of killed Palestinian civilians? </p> <p>And she persistently refers to \"violence on both sides\" (regardless of the obvious disparity between a nuclear state and a lightly-armed police force. At the last count, there were 126 Palestinian fatalities, 35% under the age of 15, 4,000 Palestinian casualties and seven Israeli fatalities). In the presidential elections Al Gore and George Bush were forced in one of their first debates to compete in an almost farcical fashion over who would be more loyal to Israel. Gore, the clear winner, who has built his career on support from the Jewish lobby, said he would pressure Yasser Arafat to stop \"provocative acts of violence\". </p> <p>Hillary Clinton, who a year ago called for a Palestinian state, has been forced into a complete U-turn in her Senate campaign. The Jews have been remarkably successful as a people, despite historic adversity. As a result, the Israeli lobby in the US is rich and influential. The media are largely controlled by the Jews, as is Hollywood and they account for more than half the top policy-making jobs in the Clinton administration. </p> <p>Driving to pick up my son from school yesterday, I was horrified to see a freshly painted red sign on a wall: \"Kill all Jews. Jihad\". And a statement has just been issued from a London based Islamist group that \"all Jews and Americans have now become targets in the Muslim lands as a result of American policy\". Abhorrent as this kind of extremism may be, it is a direct result of what Muslims see as gross injustice, due to overwhelming Jewish influence in US politics and the media. The situation can only worsen, with an increase in fundamentalism. </p> <p>Many of my friends are Jewish, as was my paternal grandfather. The sad part is that I know the majority of them desperately want peace in the Middle East, but that peace can only be achieved once the US acts as an honest broker, and the US media as impartial commentators. </p> <p>Jemima and Imran Khan live in Islamabad</p>"
