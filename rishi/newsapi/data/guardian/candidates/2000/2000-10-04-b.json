  "Police poured into a major coal mine in Yugoslavia today to break up the largest of the nationwide strikes aimed at ousting the president, Slobodan Milosevic, but authorities backed off when huge crowds responded to the workers' cries for aid. <p>Thousands of miners and supporters streamed into the Kolubara mine complex after security forces withdrew from their barricades and were mingling with strikers inside the compound. </p> <p>Meanwhile, caravans of supporters swarmed in vehicles and on foot to the mine from every direction. One bus pushed aside a police car blocking its way, witnesses said. </p> <p>Police in riot gear watched passively as the crowd swelled. </p> <p>\"Take off your uniforms and join the people,\" said Dragan Kovacevic, an opposition leader. \"The battle for Serbia was won here.\" </p> <p>The startling turnaround was hailed by foes of Mr Milosevic as another key victory in their civil disobedience campaign to force him to accept election defeat. </p> <p>At first, however, it looked as if Mr Milosevic was turning to brute force to crush dissent. Truckloads of police and soldiers swarmed into the mine complex, which employs 7,000 workers, after the government said the five-day strike threatened electricity supplies. </p> <p>However, there were no clashes or arrests, according to striker Ranko Radasinovic. </p> <p>He said about 100 policemen had taken over the head office and the main crusher plant at the strip mine near this town about 25 miles south of Belgrade. </p> <p>Workers called for help as authorities set up cordons at the entrance. But they failed to hold back crowds flocking to the open pit mine in support of the strikers. </p> <p>The confrontation came one day after the Milosevic government threatened \"special measures against leaders of strikes and road blockades\", which were launched this week to force the Yugoslav president to concede defeat to challenger Vojislav Kostunica in last month's elections. Police loyal to the embattled Serbian president also arrested several truck drivers today as they attempted to clear blockades by protesters on key roads.</p> <p>Near Pozarevac, Mr Milosevic's home town, 30 miles south of Belgrade, tensions grew after the arrest of the truckers whose vehicles were blocking the road. Dozens of people subsequently sat down on the pavement, strengthening the blockade. </p> <p>In Belgrade, where the civil disobedience campaign has been less noticeable than in smaller cities, there were signs that more people were joining the opposition campaign. </p> <p>Hundreds of stores were closed and city bus drivers and rubbish collectors stayed away from work, leaving overflowing bins scattered in the streets. </p> <p>The postal service announced a warning strike for later in the day, and by noon, the city centre was effectively put off limits to cars and other vehicles by thousands of pedestrians roaming the streets and blocking traffic. </p> <p>Fears are mounting that Mr Milosevic may resort to force to hold on to power, despite rising calls at home and abroad for him to step down in favour of Mr Kostunica. </p> <p>In an interview published in Moscow's Komersant daily, Mr Kostunica said he believed Mr Milosevic was preparing to resort to force. </p> <p>\"He experiences no moral dilemma or torments of the soul about that,\" Mr Kostunica said. \"However it is clear that he does not have enough force at present.\"</p>",

And though Gore appeared somewhat more confident and steady, neither man made a major gaffe. <p>\"Bush stumbled a bit on some questions - surprisingly seeming somewhat unsteady while presenting his critique of the administration's military policy - but overall the Texan is likely to benefit from remaining cool in the face of Gore's unrelenting critique.</p> <p>\"More striking than the personal differences during the encounter were the issue contrasts. In a campaign that some once feared would offer an echo, not a choice, the two men clashed over domestic and foreign issues ranging from tax cuts to social security and the use of American forces abroad. And neither hesitated to bundle together their differences into broader philosophical choices for the electorate.\" </p> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/campaign2000/story/0,7243,56607,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Frank Pellegrini in Time</a></b><br> \"After 90 minutes of presidential debate that ranged across nearly every imaginable issue, called at least a dozen Real Americans by their first names, veered persistently into stump-speech boilerplate, and strained and strained at being interesting political television but never quite got there, Al Gore and George W Bush are more deadlocked than ever. </p> <p>\"\u0085But were there any wounds opened? Maybe. Bush, in the middle of unrewarding digression into matters Balkan, started talking in rather warm terms about the Russians and their willingness to help pry Slobodan Milosevic out of the president's chair. Gore reminded Bush that the Russians haven't been much help in that regard. Bush: 'Obviously we wouldn't ask the Russians if they didn't agree with our answer, Mr Vice-President,' Gore: 'But they don't.' Was it Gerald Ford's liberation of Poland? Hardly. But in the debate's one foray into foreign-policy specifics, Bush sounded like he wasn't up on the facts. It will make the papers. </p> <p>\"As for Gore, the usual style points. He was overeager, pushy about getting in the last word, and definitely outsmirked the Texas governor. But he also came away, somehow, sounding like the man whose numbers just might be believed; that Bush's might just be the 'fuzzy math' that Bush complained about. That should be an easy one for a wonk like Gore - it's not, because of Gore's troubled history with the truth - but Bush still lacks the veep's visible confidence when it comes to quoting the fine print.\" </p> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/04/politics/04VIEW.html\" target=\"_new\">RW Apple Jr in the New York Times</a></b><br> \"When it was over, both the Republican and the Democrat had some reason for satisfaction. Amid a welter of conflicting claims and numbers, Mr. Bush had managed to paint Mr Gore as a Washington insider who would 'increase the size of government substantially,' and Mr Gore had tarred the Texan as an advocate of using the federal budget surplus to 'enrich the few, the wealthiest 1%'.</p> <p>\"\u0085Neither man committed an obvious gaffe; Mr Bush avoided stumbling over his own syntax or comically mispronouncing words as he had in the past. Clearly less fluent than the vice-president, he hesitated at times and gave incomplete replies at others, but on occasion he seemed more spontaneous and less programmed than Mr Gore. Mr Bush attacked more directly, accusing his rival of making 'totally false' statements about his health care proposals, using 'fuzzy math' and 'phony numbers', and 'running on Medi scare'.</p> <p>\"Whether the debate will really move the undecided voters, and so prove decisive, is also unclear, although most politicians, and many political scientists, believe it will.\" </p> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A6203-2000Oct4.html\" target=\"_new\">John F Harris in the Washington Post</a></b><br> \"Bush wanted to force a pivot in the direction of the race, establishing an aura of credibility and command to complement his existing reputation for geniality. He did get a few occasions to do that, though he did not appear as at ease discussing his plan on tonight's stage as he does in more conversational settings on the campaign trail. And he got comparatively fewer chances to talk about issues on which polls say he is on strong ground, such as military readiness and his education record in Texas.</p> <p>\"Gore's task tonight, as his aides described it, was to continue the evolution he began at the Democratic national convention. That was when he first passed what might be called the Living Room Test: are voters comfortable enough with Gore as a person, and as a leader, that they can imagine him being beamed into their homes on the evening news for the next four years?</p> <p>\"This test presented a dilemma for Gore: The usual advice given by those coaching his public performances is for him to loosen up and be natural. But the natural Gore, at least in a campaign context, is someone most comfortable on the offensive, eager to brutalise his adversaries. How to take the case against Bush, dissecting his Texas record, without seeming overbearing? At first blush, he managed to do that tonight.\" </p>",
  "We were a mere nine minutes into the first presidential debate between Al Gore and George W Bush when the Gore campaign, monstrously efficient as ever, sallied out into the media hall at the University of Massachusetts with their first rapid rebuttal of an evening that would become an orgy of spin. <p>Reality Check: Big Government was the title on what was to be the first of over a dozen handouts from the two campaign teams to the media over the next 90 minutes. The Gore campaign workers, dressed in red T-shirts bearing the words \"Let the day begin...\", alternated around our desks with Bush aides offering Setting the Record Straight handouts. </p> <p>The standard cliche about American presidential debates is that they represent the long-awaited moment when the electorate pauses from its work, rest and play to focus on deciding which way to vote on November 7. But the truth is that the debates are not so much a battle for the voters, as a battle to shape the media's message to the voters. They are, in fact, nothing less than the Olympics of spin. </p> <p>It's true that somewhere between 60 and 75m Americans were expected to watch at least part of last night's first Gore-Bush confrontation in Boston. All over America, people will have formed their own conclusions last night. Yet the verdict which the two campaigns crave above all is the media's judgment that one side or the other was the winner in the contest. </p> <p>To that end, the two sides deployed more political firepower on a single evening last night than the Sydney Olympic organisers set off fireworks to mark the end of this years Games. </p> <p>As the end of the debate neared, both parties began massing their top spinmeisters in a long open area next to the press desks, known as Spin Alley. Each spinner's presence in Spin Alley is marked by a placard, carried by an acolyte, on which the person's name is clearly marked and held aloft. For the Democrats, there were top level pros such as Bill Daley, Bob Shrum, John Kerry and Donna Shalala, For the Republicans, Karen Hughes, John Engler, George Pataki and Condoleeza Rice. And dozens more on either side. </p> <p>There's only one question that anyone in the press ever seems to ask in the scrums which form around each spinner. How do you think it went? \"He did a wonderful job. The country can be as proud of him as I am,\" said Dorothy Koch, who just happens to be George W's younger sister. \"The country saw Al Gore as a man who has a sense of the future,\" said Shrum, who is the vice-president's campaign strategist. \"Gore is like Forrest Gump,\" suggested Engler, the witty and convivial Michigan governor. </p> <p>If the presidential debates are really going to shift the momentum of the 2000 presidential contest, then it's here in Spin Alley that the battle will be fought and won. Both sides calculate that their investment in big-name quote merchants will help to tip the struggle for today's headlines their way. And not just today's. Once it becomes the received wisdom that Gore or Bush was the winner, then the perception is hard to shift. </p> <p>The media can, of course, make the wrong call on these occasions. A couple of weeks ago, Rick Lazio and Hillary Clinton squared off in a televised debate in New York where they are rivals for the vacant US Senate seat next month. Lazio was aggressive, made a lot of strong points. Most of the media awarded him the victory, only to discover that the polls tipped sharply in Clinton's favour over the next few days. </p> <p>Last night, no one seemed very sure who had \"won\". The reality is that neither of them did. Neither man forced his opponent to burst into tears, or to admit snorting cocaine, or to confess to fathering an illegitimate child. No one came up with a killer one-liner, or good joke or a well-crafted put-down. The debate was, in fact, a faithful reflection of the campaign of which it is part. Gore was knowledgeable, focused and impressive in a not particularly striking kind of way.</p> <p>Bush was likeable, tenacious, stuck to his lines and was never quite as bad as he appears capable of being. Both men lived to fight - or to debate - another day. My own sense is that Gore got a bit more out of the Boston debate than Bush did. Gore kept to his issues, while Bush was sometimes rambling and, at the end, negatively personal. Gore is moving ahead once more in the polls after Bush's late September recovery. Last night's debate will not have put the brakes on that new momentum. But you do have to wonder whether all that spinning really makes any significant difference at all.</p>",
  "Al Gore and George W Bush finally came face to face in the first of this year's US presidential debates last night, with opinion polls showing that up to a third of American voters would decide which man to support on the basis of what they saw and heard in these encounters. <p>The tension and seriousness with which both camps were viewing the debate was palpable yesterday, as the closest US presidential election contest in 20 years reached what was almost certainly its pivotal moment. </p> <p>An old-fashioned coin-toss gave Mr Gore, the Democratic candidate, the first question in the 90-minute debate, which took place at the University of Massachusetts in Boston. </p> <p>The debate was broadcast live on most of the US television networks, and was expected to attract a viewing audience of at least 60m. </p> <p>\"Tonight's not the night for gimmicks,\" Mr Bush, the Republican candidate, said as he left West Virginia for Boston, preceded by a group of advisers so large that it required a separate jet. </p> <p>Mr Bush's spin doctors said before the debate began that their man was intending to bring his 10-year programme of tax cuts totalling $1,300bn (\u00a3886bn) back to the centre of the political argument. </p> <p>Mr Gore was said to be planning to use the debate to help soften his image as a stiff policy obsessive. </p> <p>The Bush camp has spent weeks trying to lower expectations about its man's chances in the debate, in the hope that even a modestly competent performance could be seen as something of a triumph. </p> <p>Mr Gore, by contrast, faced higher expectations because of his extensive government experience and his formidable reputation in political one-on-ones. </p> <p>As well as being expected to attract the largest audience of any of the candidates' debates before the US goes to the polls in November, yesterday's TV contest was also the most intensively polled event of the election by both the Bush and Gore campaigns. </p> <p>The voters' responses to the debate will affect the tone and targeting of millions of dollars of campaign advertising about to be unleashed in key states. </p> <p>The importance that the politicians attached to the confrontation was not universally shared by television executives, however. Though the proceedings were carried live on the ABC and CBS networks, as well as on the PBS and CNN cable channels, NBC allowed affiliates to choose between the debate and a baseball game, while the Fox network chose to disregard it altogether. </p> <p>Opinion polls showed Mr Gore holding a narrow lead coming into the debate, but both camps were in no doubt that this and two further debates in the next fortnight are likely to hold the key to the outcome of the November 7 presidential contest. </p> <p>Mr Gore led Mr Bush by 46% to 40% in an eve-of-debate tracking poll for Reuters and MSNBC, and by 45% to 39% in a New York Times/CBS poll. A Washington Post/ABC survey showed Mr Gore with a nar rower lead, 48% to 46%, while the latest Gallup/CNN tracking poll had the two men all square on 45% each. </p> <p>Both men arrived in Boston early yesterday for last-minute preparations. Light campaign schedules have been the order of the day for much of the past week, as Mr Bush rehearsed at his Texas ranch and Mr Gore concentrated on swing voters in Florida, which is thought to be the biggest of the undecided states. </p> <p>Last night's debate is to be followed by Bush-Gore contests on October 11 and 17. The vice-presidential nominees - Republican Dick Cheney and Democrat Joe Lieberman - will hold their only debate tomorrow night in Kentucky. </p> <p>As the two main candidates shaped up for their initial encounter, supporters of two third-party hopefuls, Ralph Nader and Pat Buchanan, mounted protests at being kept out of the debates. Mr Nader, the Green party nominee, travelled to Boston saying he was \"looking for people to give us tickets\" to the debate, so he could register a public protest against his exclusion.</p>",
  "A senior United Nations official called for a recount of the vote in last week's Yugoslav election yesterday as the poll victor, Vojislav Kostunica, signalled he could go to Moscow later this week for talks on the post-election crisis with President Vladimir Putin. <p>In Belgrade, Jiri Dienstbier - the UN human rights rapporteur for present-day Yugoslavia, Croatia and Bosnia - said the ruling party had rigged the results of the September 24 vote. He demanded a recount rather than support the plan by Slobodan Milosevic's regime for a second-round run-off this Sunday. </p> <p>\"The results must have been manipulated,\" Mr Dienstbier said in the Serbian capital. </p> <p>Mr Dienstbier, a former Czech foreign minister, has been one of the few international officials in Yugoslavia during the election crisis that many fear could spill into civil war due to Mr Milosevic's evident determination to hang on despite faring poorly in the September vote against Mr Kostunica, the main opposition contender. </p> <p>\"The truth should be discovered and both sides should accept the demand to recount the votes,\" he said, alleging that the main ballot-rigging occurred in Kosovo. </p> <p>His remarks put him at odds with Moscow, which is seeking to play the central role in mediating the crisis; President Putin had offered to host Mr Milosevic and Mr Kostunica in Moscow in the next few days. </p> <p>The Kremlin says Sunday's proposed second round should go ahead, tacitly accepting Mr Milosevic's argument that the opposition did not win an outright majority, although other Russian statements have favoured Mr Kostunica, who has said he would boycott a second-round run-off. </p> <p>Borislav Milosevic, the Yugoslav ambassador in Moscow and the president's older brother, yesterday insisted that Sunday's second round would go ahead whether or not Mr Kostunica boycotted it. He said he did not know if his brother would accept Mr Putin's offer of mediation and come to Moscow. </p> <p>Dmitry Rogozin, head of Russia's parliamentary foreign affairs committee, who knows Mr Kostunica and saw ambassador Milosevic yesterday, said the chances of crisis talks taking place in Moscow were slim. </p> <p>But Mr Kostunica's Democratic party of Serbia told Russian officials in Belgrade that its candidate would travel to Moscow if he was given an audience with the Russian president, who is in India until tomorrow. </p> <p>\"If there is an official invitation and if there are guarantees Putin himself will really see Kostunica, he would go, and that could be [tomorrow],\" a party source said. </p> <p>Moscow's Interfax news agency reported that Mr Kostunica had accepted the Russian offer, but Mr Kostunica, speaking to the Russian daily Kommersant for today's edition, appeared less sure. </p> <p>\"President Vladimir Putin's proposal is very much in my interests,\" Mr Kostunica said. \"All that remains to be done is work out certain details and the format of the meeting in Moscow.\" </p> <p>If the meeting goes ahead, its thrust could be to get Mr Kostunica to run on Sunday in return for international monitoring of the vote and Kremlin guarantees that Mr Milosevic will stand by the verdict, Interfax reported. </p> <p>What is uncertain is whether Mr Milosevic will make such commitments. </p> <p>The UN war-crimes tribunal has indicted Mr Milosevic for war crimes in Kosovo - and is about to extend the charges to war crimes committed by forces under his command earlier in Bosnia and Croatia. </p> <p>Russia is a permanent member of the UN security council and formally would be obliged to arrest Mr Milosevic in Moscow. </p> <p>After talks in Belgrade with Milosevic government officials and the Kostunica camp, Russia's Balkan envoy, Vladimir Chizhov, said both sides remained dangerously far apart. </p> <p>Returning to Moscow last night, Mr Chizhov called for a solution that \"would ensure the legitimacy of a new Yugoslav leadership disputed by no one\". That appeared to support Mr Kostunica, since the west will not recognise President Milosevic should he try to hold on. </p> <p>A website run by advisers to Mr Putin said bluntly that Mr Milosevic was finished and that Moscow should press him to step down. </p> <p>\"The current regime in Belgrade has been dealt a stunning blow from which it can barely recover,\" it said. </p> <p>\"The fall of Slobodan Milosevic is only a matter of time ... Russia's support could tip the scales in Serbia in favour of the opposition and convince Milosevic not to try to cling to power.\"</p>",
  "In the first direct challenge to the wave of demonstrations against President Slobodan Milosevic, 11 striking miners and two Serbian opposition leaders were ordered to be detained on suspicion of sabotage yesterday. <p>The miners are members of the strike committee at Serbia's largest coal mine, Kolubara, where 4,500 workers have been on strike since Friday. </p> <p>The two opposition leaders, Nebojsa Covic and Boris Tadic, visited the mine on Sunday night, when police sealed off the area. Mr Covic is the leader of the Democratic Alternative, a relatively small party within the opposition. Mr Tadic is deputy head of the larger Democratic Party. </p> <p>The Belgrade public prosecutor demanded an investigation, saying there was a suspicion that they had \"been accomplices in criminal sabotage\". </p> <p>Meanwhile, in the Yugoslav capital, tens of thousands of students walked out of exams and joined hands to form chains across major highways. </p> <p>Anti-riot squad police stood by in blue camouflage fatigues as the students moved down the road toward Beli Dvor, the white palace of President Milosevic, shouting \"Save Serbia and kill yourself, Slobodan\" to the accompaniment of blaring car horns. </p> <p>Two coachloads of the intervention squads were guarding Mr Milosevic's home, but the students sought disruption, not confrontation and when the road was blocked, they diverted to a square and another road. </p> <p>Another group of tens of thousands of students marched from Plato square to Autokomanda square, just below the leafy suburb of Dedinje, home of Belgrade's rich. </p> <p>The embattled government issued a statement threatening to crack down on the opposition, calling them subversive elements waging warfare through strikes and blockades. </p> <p>In a statement, read on state television, it was announced that judges could jail those involved in civil disobedience for two to three months. </p> <p>Dissenters in the judiciary were told to resign. But opposition leaders and supporters remained defiant and insisted that Mr Milosevic accept his landslide election defeat. They claim their results show that presidential challenger Vojislav Kostunica won the election outright and that the regime committed massive voting fraud. </p> <p>A campaign of strikes and civil disobedience combined with legal appeals is being used to pressure the state election committee, which claims Mr Kostunica was not the outright winner of the presidential poll and is calling for a second round. </p> <p>The opposition has ruled out participation in Sunday's planned run-off. </p> <p>\"No one has the right to so bluntly annul the people's will,\" said Mr Kostunica. </p> <p>The opposition claims that a computer diskette thrown through a window of the Yugoslav statistics office building has provided them with evidence of the real results of the election on September 24. </p> <p>Mladjan Dinkic, leader of the G17 independent think tank told a news conference: \"We've got the proof now, but the electoral commission is the one to present the real results to the public.\" </p> <p>Across the country, particularly in towns that fell to the opposition in last month's elections, strikes and blockades are crippling all activity. </p> <p>On Monday night miners at the Kolubara complex ignored an appeal to return to work by the Yugoslavia army chief, Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic - the first time Mr Milosevic has called on the military to help end the protests. </p> <p>\"We are under pressure from the police, psychological not physical pressure,\" said Predrag Stepanovic, a member of the strike committee. </p> <p>After the general failed to resolve the coal mine impasse, the government struck back at opposition-run cities and towns across country by introducing four-hour power cuts allegedly triggered by the strike. Electricity was lost in parts of capital Belgrade for four hours as well as cities such as Nis and Novi Sad. </p> <p>The campaign of civil disobedience is the most serious challenge yet to Milosevic's 13-year rule. </p>",
  "Hundreds of journalists working for state-controlled broadcasters and newspapers in Yugoslavia are demanding the right to report the news impartially, as Slobodan Milosevic's strangehold on the media begins to loosen. <p>Their rebellion follows the failure of the state election commission to recognise the outright victory claimed by opposition presidential candidate Vojislav Kostunica in last month's presidential poll. </p> <p>Yesterday the head of French and Italian programmes at Radio Yugoslavia - the closest thing in Belgrade to the BBC World Service - was fired for seeking a more balanced editorial policy. </p> <p>Vladimir Pavlovic, who had worked for the broadcasting service for 26 years, said: \"The editorial policy of Radio Yugoslavia comes from federal government - and in reality it comes from Milosevic and his wife, Mira Markovic.\" </p> <p>The chief of Radio Yugoslavia, Ivan Markovic, is the minister of telecommunications and the spokesman for Ms Markovic's political party, the Yugoslav United Left. </p> <p>\"We have been all the time feeling bad about what Radio Yugoslavia does,\" Mr Pavlovic added. \"But I'm a professional and it is my job.\" </p> <p>He said that after the election eight journalists - out of a total of 200 employees at the service - formally requested a more balanced editorial policy. </p> <p>\"There's a big amount of repression. People are scared. I have a child I have to look after,\" he said. Despite his concerns for his job, he agreed to sign the journalists' written request. </p> <p>\"The petition is saying that we journalists of Radio Yugoslavia ask our general manager and editor to change the editorial policy, and to admit an alternative point of view. We want to make it possible for other voices to b e heard,\" he said. </p> <p>When Mr Pavlovic went into work yesterday a security guard at the door confiscated his identity card. </p> <p>Belgrade-based staff from the culture department of Radio Television Serbia (RTS), which is also controlled by the state, were yesterday planning a similar written request for more open coverage. Six employees working for RTS in Novi Sad, the second largest city, who circulated a petition calling for objective reporting have been sacked. </p> <p>A number of local radio and TV stations that were within the RTS system have been boycotting the state news, which serves as the biggest television propaganda outlet for the Milosevic regime. </p> <p>According to information gathered by the Belgrade-based Association of Independent Media, nine stations have stopped broadcasting RTS news. They include three broadcasters in the eastern town of Zajecar, previously a heartland of support for President Milosevic's coalition. </p> <p>In the capital, more than 60 employees - including journalists - working for state-controlled Radio Belgrade are reported to be circulating a petition demanding a change in editorial policy. </p> <p>A second Radio Belgrade channel is also said to be disrupted by protests, with staff also said to be calling for fair reporting. </p> <p>Fifty reporters at the Vecernje Novosti newspaper are said to have called for a new editorial line. An open letter is also reportedly circulating demanding that the paper adopts an independent stance. </p> <p>Of all the cities across Yugoslavia, Belgrade has been the most affected by a clampdown on all non-government broadcasting media, with the exception of a small student radio station. </p> <p>In May police stormed the Belgrade City Studio B Station, the only non-government radio and television station with national reach. The station broadcast opposition viewpoints and was controlled by the opposition Serbian Renewal Movement. </p> <p>Western European governments have sought to break the media isolation by funding a non-government radio station, Studio B292, which runs a website and can be heard by those with a satellite dish. Most people in the capital cannot afford such luxuries. </p> <p>The B292 reports have been circulated and made available to radio stations in towns controlled by the opposition. As a result, residents of several provincial towns are far better informed about non-government activity than many people living in the capital.</p>",

At the end of the last series, Mr Bartlet travelled out of Washington to deliver a speech to Virginia university students along with his daughter Zoe, who is dating the president's black aide, Charlie Young. </p> <p>As the Bartlet entourage left the hall in Virginia, a pair of stony-faced young white racists started shooting. </p> <p>\"Who's been hit?\" NBC has repeatedly asked in its trailers throughout the summer. President Bartlet, most series fans believe, has survived the fusillade. But the fate of Zoe, her secret service agent, Lisa, and Charlie is less clear. </p>",
  "When Ariel Sharon set out on his infamous stroll up to the Dome of the Rock last week, the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, faced a no-win situation. <p>He was well aware of the anger that allowing Mr Sharon's visit to the sacred site would provoke among Muslims. But he also knew the political risks of preventing the opposition leader from expressing his views. </p> <p>Weighing up the costs and benefits, Mr Barak decided the greater danger to his government lay on the domestic front rather than among the Palestinians - and made the appropriate choice. </p> <p>When trouble flared, he responded in the tough way that many Israelis appreciate: with bullets, tanks and helicopter gunships. </p> <p>Despite the worldwide condemnation of the killings of Palestinians, whose deaths in the last few days of troubles outnumber those of Israelis by around 16 to 1, there has been no serious criticism within Israel of Mr Barak's handling of the military situation. </p> <p>At the same time, his rival, Mr Sharon, has not gained any noticeable credit from the affair. </p> <p>This led one Israeli source to suggest yesterday that Mr Barak \"will not be going down in a hurry\": his chances of survival in the short term are probably better than a week ago. </p> <p>Two alternative scenarios have been mapped out which depend, largely, on whether or not the violence continues. </p> <p>If the violence continues, the prospect of early elections could recede as Israeli politicians rally round Mr Barak to see the country through the emergency. For the sake of national unity, Mr Barak would almost certainly bring Mr Sharon's Likud into his coalition, but this would also bring the peace process to a halt. </p> <p>If the violence subsides, Mr Barak can be expected to make a further push for a peace deal within a few weeks - though no one is hopeful of a successful outcome. In this scenario, Mr Barak would try to assemble a different coalition with a civil agenda and keep the peace process ticking over through regular, but low-level, contacts. </p> <p>None of this would be good for Mr Barak's long-term prospects, however. He was elected 17 months ago on a peace platform and has so far failed to deliver anything beyond the withdrawal from Lebanon. </p> <p>Elsewhere, he had been trying to play off the Syrian track of the peace process against the Palestinian track, but that was stymied by the death last June of the Syrian president, Hafez al-Asad. </p> <p>Israel recognises that the Syrian track cannot be re-started until the late president's son, Bashar, is more firmly established. A high-level Israeli source told the Guardian last week that this might take 12 months, but they would be keen to move it along once he is ready. </p> <p>If Mr Barak survives long enough, there is, therefore, a slim chance that he could deliver peace with Syria before the next election. But on the Palestinian front there is continuing gloom because the political climate in Israel does not permit the kind of concessions - particularly over Jerusalem and the refugees - that would be accepted by the Palestinians and the wider Arab world. </p> <p>Mr Barak's other problem is the Israeli opposition. Despite the raucous noises, there is little sign that they want an immediate election. The Shas party, for one, lacks the funds to run a campaign. </p> <p>On the Likud side, there is the unspoken rivalry between the leader, Mr Sharon, and the former prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, whose rehabilitation began last week after the attorney general decided not to prosecute him for corruption. </p> <p>In the election 17 months ago, Mr Barak beat Mr Netanyahu to the premiership by 56 % to 44%. An opinion poll by Gallup/Ma'ariv on on September 13 showed Mr Netanyahu leading Mr Barak by 39% to 38%, but Mr Barak leading Mr Sharon by 39% to 32%. </p> <p>This suggests that Mr Netanyahu has a better chance than Mr Sharon of beating Mr Barak in an election.</p>",
  "Pierre Trudeau (Obituary, September 30) identified with, and appealed to, the idealism of the young. President Lyndon Johnson may have wanted a \"great society\" for the United States, but Trudeau called for a \"just society\" in Canada. <p>Trudeau caught and shaped the 60s wave. He articulated the values of a generation that desperately wanted to make a difference, and we never forgot. In Canada today, we are all Trudeau's children. He was not content to merely represent consensus, he intended to mould it. And his style was as great a magnet in attracting the attention of Canadians as the worth of his ideas. He was the perfect post-1967 representative of the Canada we wanted to be - bilingual, cosmopolitan and adventurous. </p> <p>I knew many different Pierre Trudeaus: the intellectual at peace in his study, and the exhibitionist doing a pirouette; the gunslinger taking on all comers in the House of Commons in Ottawa, and a lover of children, making them feel at ease outside his office; the willing recipient of the adulation of thousands, and the loner who never lost his private reserve. He did not manufacture or create a false self. </p> <p>Trudeau knew music, poetry, literature, history, economics, architecture, philosophy and law. He was at his best in a crisis - the FLQ in 1970, the election of the Parti Quebecois in 1976, the 1980 referendum and the 1981 patriation of the constitution - because he had judgment, intelligence, courage and, above all, inner steel. </p> <p>The main outlines of the Trudeau Project are well known: the Charter of Rights, the Official Languages Act, the fight against separatism, a multi-cultural Canada, an activist government, and an independent foreign policy. What is seldom remarked upon, however, is that the foundation of his philosophy was a belief that leaders draw their authority not from office, but as a gift from the people. </p> <p>In 1980, for example, having just been returned to office, a poll showed that the separatists were ahead in the upcoming referendum. The Cabinet Office was duly alarmed and aides and advisers rushed in full of foreboding. One man, however, was calm amidst the turmoil. \"I know Quebecers,\" the prime minister said, \"they will never vote to leave Canada.\" Confidence in the judgment of the people was the starting point of his approach to politics. </p> <p>I first met Trudeau in the autumn of 1966 at the National Liberal convention. He was a newly elected MP, I was a youth delegate from Winnipeg. On the floor of the conference, I argued for the federal government to take a direct role in urban affairs. He dissented vigorously. The debate continued in the hallway. As the doors to the elevator in the Chateau Laurier were about to close, he snapped: \"Look, read the constitution.\" For the next 20 years, I did little else but. </p> <p>Teaching the spirit of the constitution means that the role of the leader - by word, deed and example - is to embody our highest ideals. Leaders should appeal to the better angels of our nature. That is the secret of Trudeau's continuing hold on Canadians. </p> <p>He was our only prime minister to be as influential out of office as during his heyday of power. This was because he always had the largest, most inclusive vision - a tolerant, open, sharing, independent, just society. His vision may have been impractical, but it was never ignoble. </p>"
