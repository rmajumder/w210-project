  "The consensus among political junkies and talking heads on this side of the Atlantic is that Al Gore's pick of Joe Lieberman as his running mate saved Gore's tush. But the new Gore-Lieberman brand has yet to be tested. And the first big test is whether it will fall into the trap the Republicans have set for it this week in Los Angeles. <p>Gore's choice of Lieberman was smart on three grounds. First, the chutzpah of picking an orthodox Jew grabbed the political momentum away from George W. Bush right after Bush's perfectly-scripted Republican convention, thereby checking Bush's convention 'bounce' in the polls. Second, given Lieberman's concern about moral values in America and his outspoken criticism of President Clinton's liaison with Monica Lewinsky, the pick gives Gore some protection against Republican attempts to tar him with Clinton's turpitude. Finally, Lieberman is a conservative Democrat, which helps Gore with the same moderate swing-voters Bush is trying to court. </p> <p>But these advantages won't carry Gore far. Lieberman may be 'the conscience of the Senate', as one enthusiastic Democrat put it, but until last week most Americans had never heard of him. Senators are little known outside the states they represent and Lieberman is no exception. </p> <p>There's also the question of latent anti-Semitism in America. Quite simply, no one knows how extensive it may be. People rarely tell pollsters they're bigots. The proof will come on election day in the privacy of voting booths. And Lieberman's conservatism is a mixed blessing. It may rankle liberal Democrats who comprise the core of the party, many of whom weren't wild about Gore to begin with. A small number will shift their allegiance to Ralph Nader. Others may not vote. </p> <p>Democrats are holding their breath. They hope their convention in Los Angeles this week will be at least as successful a stage show for introducing the new Gore-Lieberman brand as was the Republican convention for introducing Bush-Cheney. But many things could go wrong in LA. </p> <p>Democrats have never had a reputation for being particularly disciplined. The Democratic party is a larger tent than the Republican one - including labour unions, environmentalists, libertarians, African-Americans, Jews, old lefties, so-called New Democrats, trial lawyers, and civil servants - and not all these groups get on with the others. After eight years of the Clinton administration, moreover, some of them are outright disappointed. Rank-and-file union members are upset with Gore on his pro-trade stance, for example, and some of them will be on the convention floor talking to reporters. </p> <p>Plus, there's the complication of two other national Democratic campaigns competing with Gore's - Hillary Clinton's, for the US Senate from New York, which is drawing off donations and media attention; and Bill Clinton's for his place in history, which also needs money (for a presidential library and related accoutrements) and attention (to what he has accomplished in office). Also, count on bigger and more disruptive demonstrations outside the convention hall than occurred in Philadelphia. Los Angeles is easier to get to than Philadelphia, California is flakier than Pennsylvania and Democrats always attract more demonstrators. </p> <p>But the biggest trap has been laid by the Republicans, whose own convention embodied all the traditional images of a Democratic one - a kaleidoscope of ethnic groups; an address by the sole avowedly gay Republican member of Congress; the gentle rhetoric of tolerance and inclusion; the suggestion of policies that will help children become better educated, help working families afford health insurance and ensure that social security will be saved. </p> <p>Democrats are eager to reveal the hypocrisy at the heart of the Republican strategy. Who are these Republicans to adopt Democratic images and themes when for the last eight years the Republicans have gone out of their way to thwart Democratic goals? How dare they speak as if they're responsible for the good times when the Clinton-Gore administration inherited a $300 billion deficit? How can they talk inclusion when they remain the exclusive province of relatively wealthy whites, and when the policies they are advocating even today in Congress - policies that their vice-presidential nominee, Dick Cheney, advocated when he was a member - consistently help the rich and powerful, while burdening the poor and powerless? </p> <p>Hence the trap. Republicans would like nothing better than for Al Gore and Joe Lieberman to become attack dogs this coming week, and for the Democratic convention to wallow in harsh partisanship. </p> <p>Republicans know that Americans have come to hate partisan bickering. After witnessing eight long years of bitter wrangling in Washington, including Newt Gingrich's shock troops, a government shut-down, independent counsel Ken Starr's witch hunt, Bill Clinton's recklessness, the character assassinations and press leaks, and a truly bizarre impeachment, they're fed up with politics. They're also bored to tears with it. Thanks to the new system of early, front-loaded primaries, they've known for five months who the two major candidates will be, and there are three long months to go, including a baseball World Series, the Olympics and the TV networks' autumn premieres. </p> <p>Americans don't even want to think about politics. It's a time of peace and relative prosperity in America, the summer of our content, in an era of great social rest. Smugness has settled over the land like thick yellow smog. The nation is enjoying the longest economic expansion on record, so long, in fact, that most people don't quite remember exactly when the economy was bad, or who was in charge then, and who should get credit for the good times. And, frankly, they don't much care. </p> <p>Not all Americans are sharing in the prosperous times, of course, and not everywhere in the world is peaceful. But Americans feel no common peril, no sense that the nation faces a crucial choice about anything. </p> <p>Aware of all this, the Republicans who gathered in Philadelphia gave America exactly what it wanted - the least political convention in American history, filled with cotton-candy images of tolerance and prosperity, patriotic drivel and sentimental fluff. Even the Republicans' attacks on Gore and the Democrats were done with a light touch. Dick Cheney looked like a gentle grandfather. George W.'s zingers were packaged in some humorous lines and vacuous homilies about restoring dignity to the White House. </p> <p>If, this week, Gore and Lieberman hurl accusations of hypocrisy at the Republicans, as they will want to do, America will hear only strident voices. If they are indignant and self-righteous, as they have every reason to be, America will hear only sanctimony. If they try to take credit for the economy and blame the Republicans for blocking progress on social security, good schools and the rest, as is perfectly fair, America will hear only partisan posturing. </p> <p>That's exactly what the Republicans want. They've adopted Democratic imagery in order to make the Republican ticket seem far less frightening than it would if the right-wing social conservatives were let loose. And they want to lure the Democrats into attacking them for doing so, which makes the Democrats sound shrill and partisan while the Republicans stay above the fray. Their goal is to keep this up until October, when Americans finally begin to focus on the election. By then, if the Republican plan works, the new Gore-Lieberman brand will seem like the old brand of American politics, while Bush-Cheney will seem brand new. </p> <p>\u0095 Robert B.

  "The appliers of political science had no doubt about it. At universities across America, they fed all the relevant data about the economy, wealth, jobs and crime into their computers - and produced an overwhelming verdict. Hail President Gore! An open-and-shut case. But now the computers themselves are shutting down. <p>The presidential race rates as high summer horror. The nation is on heatwave holiday, drifting between barbecue and beach, manifestly uninterested in politics. TV viewing figures for the Republicans in Philadelphia were sharply down on 1996: the big turn-off proceeds exponentially over decades. </p> <p>Yet modern history also says that the candidate who leads the polls on Labour Day weekend at the start of September is the candidate who wins in November. Only Ronald Reagan, 20 years ago, bucked that law - and whatever else Al Gore is, he ain't no Ronald Reagan. </p> <p>The Vice-President comes to Los Angeles this week trailing a cautiously triumphant George W. Bush on every one of those polls, usually by more than 10 points. The convention is his only realistic chance of getting back into contention. Either he begins to transform the way America sees him - warm, not chilly; interesting, not boring; human, not policy wonkish; Al, not Bill - or he will be the pre-ordained loser. </p> <p>No easy brief. I have, as it happens, met Gore twice. One time (an interview) he couldn't have been more superciliously brusque. Southern charm? Forget it. He could hardly bother to move his lips. And the other time (in Boston this spring) he kept an international conference waiting for half an hour while he slotted in unscheduled TV appearances in the back lobby. His record for failing to win friends is richly deserved. </p> <p>Is Clinton-Gore the problem, as the Republicans would have us believe? Are 'dignity' and 'honour' the buzz words for success? The funniest thing of all in the polls is the way that the supposedly reviled Clinton, now peddling New Penitence like a stomach powder, still coasts along with 60 per cent approval ratings, while the man who didn't touch Monica Lewinsky - or fib about it - is 20 or so points behind that. Gore has an effusively loving wife, an adoring family, and Southern morality to spare: but, for the moment, he is also the issue. His policy platform isn't popular: but he is less popular still. </p> <p>So to the Los Angeles personality transplant ward. Al has been taking the pre-med tablets already, voyaging relentlessly to hometown meetings in Carthage, Tennessee, with his new friend Joe Lieberman and three dozen camera crews to meet grey-haired women who remember him as a lovable guy. His collar is ritually unbuttoned these days, jacket cast aside. He's regular and relaxed and (not for the first time) re-made. </p> <p>How will it play in LA? The selection of Senator Lieberman as his running mate may not be enthusing the big donors of Hollywood, but otherwise it went down well. Lieberman arrives on the main screen as a 'moderate' beloved on both sides of the Senate (a word reserved for Mr Conservative in-betweens). Most of the attention may have concentrated on his Orthodox Jewry - and the blonde second wife whose parents escaped a Nazi concentration camp - but he has one attribute beyond mere history. He's a politician who answers the question: a pearl beyond media price. </p> <p>Ask Senator Joey (as his wife calls him, to winces off) why he doesn't follow the Gore line on education vouchers - or, more difficult - whether he intends to run for the Senate as well as the vice-presidency, and he'll give you a straightforward, thoughtfully clear response. The human being bit comes naturally. </p> <p>This is not altogether good news for Gore. Lieberman is on the ticket because his was the first sombre voice to speak out against sex in the Oval Office. He's a formal break with the sleaze of the past. But he also possesses the vital attribute his master lacks. He couldn't be wooden if he tried. </p> <p>It is one of the great curiosities of this election that both main candidates now have putative Vice-Presidents who, on any normal count, are better - more knowledgeable, more sentient, less mechanical - than they are themselves. The Veeps look better than the Prezzas. And neither of them, disasters aside, has any real chance of being President themselves. Time and age are against them. </p> <p>Gore is the Democratic contender now because he wasn't as good as Bill Clinton then. He inherited rather than won the nomination. He has, thus far, lacked any clear strategy - trapped between attacking the Republicans and defending a dying administration. </p> <p>Now he has to stand in his own right. He has to deliver the assets the computers have stored. Now he has to win a few hearts - or, at the least, show that he has one.</p>",
  "At first I was tempted to laugh it off. The Foreign Office had issued a warning that Western journalists in Zimbabwe might be targets of violent intimidation by the Mugabe government. Such things must not be taken seriously, I thought. <p>But then a United States embassy official telephoned to say it had received intelligence reports that government agents, presumably from the notorious Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO), planned to harass British and American correspondents. Maybe muggings, maybe robberies, maybe just roughing up or even beating somebody, said the embassy official. Be careful, he said. </p> <p>Certainly the warnings did not come out of the blue. For years President Robert Mugabe has fumed and spluttered at foreign journalists. Most recently he was furious with coverage that exposed the widespread violence his regime unleashed against its own people during the campaign for the June parliamentary elections. </p> <p>More than 30 supporters of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) were killed by Mugabe's agents during the campaign. Foreign correspondents and Zimbabwe's own hardy, independent journalists chronicled the deaths and the thousands of beatings and the intimidation meted out by Mugabe's Zanu-PF party. The President and his ministers repeatedly denounced the press for reporting lies and painting the country in a negative light. On Friday, Mugabe launched yet another barb when speaking at the Heroes' Day commemoration to honour those who died for Zimbabwe's independence. </p> <p>'Of course the Western media, which has no support for that which is non-white, has described our land acquisition exercise as a land grab,' he railed. 'They have no support for the aspirations of developing countries.' </p> <p>Stan Mudenge, Foreign Minister, also lashed out at the foreign press last week. Pounding the table for emphasis, he accused the Western press of working to divide Zimbabwe along racial lines. </p> <p>Yet it is Mugabe's own vitriolic speeches, not foreign press reports, that seek to promote racial hatred. The president's leadership has been repudiated by the majority of Zimbabwean people who have refused to accept his vilification of whites. They know it is the government's policies - not the whites or press reports in London - which have impoverished most of the country's people. </p> <p>The warnings to the foreign press circulated through London and Washington, and some news agencies took them seriously. The Associated Press decided to pull its correspondent and television cameraman out of Harare until things cooled down. The US agency also plans to strengthen security at its reporters' homes. </p> <p>But there is nothing especially new in all this. The critical press, both foreign and local, have become inured to Mugabe's attacks and veiled threats. Zimbabwean journalists have been the most vulnerable to intimidation and we in the foreign press corps have been relatively unscathed. </p> <p>If the Mugabe government has decided now that it wants to threaten the foreign press - then so be it. Now we can look our Zimbabwean colleagues in the eye and say that we, too, have the courage of our convictions. We all learnt in school playgrounds that the only way to deal with a bully is to stand up to him. </p> <p>Many Zimbabweans have stood up to the swaggering bully that the Mugabe government has become. Chengetai Zvauya, a reporter for the Sunday Standard, has been repeatedly harassed. A few weeks ago he was dragged from a group of journalists covering a speech by war veterans' leader Chenjerai 'Hitler' Hunzvi. As Hunzvi looked on, his followers bundled Zvauya away and beat him for two hours. Within a week the reporter was back at work. </p> <p>Mark Chavunduka and Ray Choto, also of the Standard, have experienced terrifying torture at the hands of government agents. Chavunduka, the paper's editor, and Choto, the senior reporter, were abducted and held for several days in 1998 after publishing a story that angered the army. They were severely beaten and tortured with electric shocks. </p> <p>They were warned on pain of death not to tell anyone of their brutal treatment, but still exposed the government agents. Two years on, no one has been arrested for abusing them, although positive identifications were made. </p> <p>Geoffrey Nyarota has also stood up to threats from the Mugabe regime. He has received written death threats and threats on the telephone. The offices of his paper, the Daily News, were bombed in April. Nyarota and his staff carry on publishing and their paper has surpassed the state-owned Herald in circulation. </p> <p>The previously unassailable Herald became such a government propaganda rag during the election campaign that no one wanted to pay to read it. The Herald's editorial policy has become more even-handed since the elections, but the damage has been done. Zimbabweans want to read the Daily News. </p> <p>Trevor Ncube and Iden Wetherell, editors of the weekly Zimbabwe Independent, have also received death threats. They try not to work their staff after office hours because the reporters might get roughed up when going home late. </p> <p>There are many other Zimbabweans who have refused to be cowed by threats from the government. Human rights activists, church leaders, lawyers, trade union members: they all know that democracy will fail unless people stand up to bullies. They all believe Zimbabwe deserves better than rule by petty thugs and gangsters. </p> <p>So now the Mugabe government wants to threaten the foreign press and add it to the lengthy list of its enemies. My response is that we have been included in very good company indeed.</p>",
  "Tommy Sheridan's answering machine tells you much. 'Sorry I can't take your call,' he says, 'but I'm probably out fighting Blair's New Tories.' <p>His room at Glasgow City Chambers, where we meet, tells you more. Parliamentary and council papers are neatly stacked on the table and when I spill a drop of coffee he halts his discourse to mop it up. </p> <p>Sheridan combines passion with order, ideology with organisational drive. It is eight years since he went to prison for leading resistance to the poll tax. While in Saughton he was elected councillor for Pollok, the housing scheme where he grew up. And it is 16 months since he and the Scottish Socialist Party of which he was a co-founder won a seat in the new Parliament. </p> <p>Now the man once reviled by the Daily Record as a 'dodger' has matured into a formidable political talent and writes a column for the paper that sneered at him. His party is beginning to worry not just Labour but the SNP too and the Bill he has co-sponsored to abolish warrant sales elicited the first sign that the new Parliament could mature into a body with a mind of its own. </p> <p>MSPs threw the ruling coalition into disarray by endorsing the Bill in principle even though, as Sheridan gloomily tells you, the Executive is still trying to kick it into touch. </p> <p>In a way Sheridan, 36, should be grateful to warrant sales and the sheriff's officers who carry them out. He was sent to prison for contempt of court because, as president of the Anti-Poll Tax Federation, he defied an interdict banning him from taking part in a demonstration against the warrant sale of a single parent's property in Glasgow, in 1991. 'There would have been fisticuffs,' says Sheridan. In the event the police called off the sale because they couldn't guarantee the safety of the sheriff's officers. </p> <p>But the authorities' rapid and relentless pursuit of Sheridan established his national profile. While interim interdicts are often breached, imprisonment rarely results. But they decided to make an example of him. He recalls: 'It backfired spectacularly. People saw we were prepared to go to the n th degree. It's been an invaluable asset ever since.' </p> <p>Sheridan's zeal for politics began at school and in the home. Modern studies classes made him aware of South Africa and apartheid, of Martin Luther King and segregation. His father, a storekeeper at Rolls-Royce in Hillington, worked tirelessly for the football team Pollok United. From him Sheridan learnt the value of community. </p> <p>But from his mother he learnt political activism. After years in the bar trade she joined the TGWU and the Labour Party and Sheridan went to Stirling University to study politics and economics as a party member. As the first member of his family to go to university, he was nervous about failing. He worked hard - and discovered Marx. </p> <p>He says: 'Marx and Marxism - it was like a treasure chest of explanation and information. Here was a philosophy which gave some rationale to life itself.' </p> <p>After university his activism grew. He went to the picket lines during the Stockport Messenger dispute and at Wapping. By now involved in Militant Tendency, he escaped successive purges and began his anti-poll tax campaign in the local party in Pollok. After a narrow vote against the non-payment campaign on the grounds that it defied the law, the local MP, the late Jimmy Dunnachie, instigated the proceedings that led to Sheridan's expulsion in 1989 'for bringing the party into disrepute'. </p> <p>It was while out on bail pending his unsuccessful appeal against his six-month sentence in 1992 that he and others formed Scottish Militant Labour. From behind bars he contested Pollok in the April general election and came second with 19 per cent of the vote. At the council elections that May the party won four Glasgow seats (only Sheridan remains on the council). </p> <p>In 1997 the party mutated into the Scottish Socialist Alliance, with support from Communists, Greens and Nationalists and put up 10 general election candidates. This, says Sheridan, built trust on the left but by 1999 it was decided to turn the alliance into a party. </p> <p>The SSP was formed with more than 400 members. In last year's Scottish elections it fielded 25 candidates and was represented in all eight regional lists. Sheridan himself took almost 8 per cent of the vote in Glasgow, though elsewhere the party's share was below 2 per cent. In the Euro elections the same year the party scored 4 per cent. </p> <p>He claims that SSP, feeding on disillusion with Blairite Labour, is growing fast. He says: 'We're now sitting with 2,200 members and 51 branches. I'm going over in two weeks time to Kirkwall to establish a branch. </p> <p>'We've got branches in the south, in Dumfries, Lanarkshire and Ayrshire, and in the north, at Inverness. It's hugely rapid growth. Our timing has been impeccable. We've touched a raw nerve. We couldn't have done this if Labour hadn't been elected. People needed to see for themselves Labour in power. </p> <p>'People are absolutely disenchanted. And in Scotland Labour has a few problems. There is not just one alternative - the SNP - there are two - the SNP and us. The SNP's problem is that they lack clarity in what they stand for, as the leadership election shows.' By contrast the SSP has a 'clear ideological programme'. What is it? 'We want an independent socialist Scotland that raises the need for common ownership and social control of our economy back on the political agenda.' </p> <p>The Scottish Parliament so far, he concedes, has been disappointing. It has too few powers but what annoys him is that it has been unwilling to use those it does have - for example over local taxation. </p> <p>Sheridan wants to replace the regressive council tax, which hits the poor as it hits the rich, with a Scottish service tax. It would exempt all those earning less than \u00a310,000 a year, would be collected at source, remove the need for warrant sales and last year would have generated \u00a3100 million more than council tax. </p> <p>'You could to it tomorrow. But they're not willing to use even the limited powers they've got to effect social change and introduce more equality into our society.' </p> <p>The SSP plans to contest the next General Election 'in a big way'. He says: 'We're going to try to stand in all 72 seats - even though our undemocratic electoral system, based on money, means that we'll need \u00a372,000 to cover deposits and materials.' He adds: 'It's a lot of money for a small Scottish party. But we're going to go for it. We're standing to build a profile. We're standing to gain party loyalty.' </p> <p>The next Scottish elections in 2003 he sees as a major opportunity. Sheridan hopes the party can win 10 or more seats and thinks eight-to-10 well within its grasp. He continues: 'The SNP, I think, will gain and Labour will lose, the Liberal Democrats will lose. You might have the SNP then looking to form an administration with some of the smaller parties. If that happened then our demand would be that our redistributive policies are on the agenda. That's a price the SNP would have to pay. Whether they'd be willing to pay it I don't know but we wouldn't be easy negotiators. We're not after power for power's sake. Our whole history has shown that.' </p> <p>Sheridan describes himself as a 'revolutionary' committed to an open and democratic road. Essentially, one senses, he is still part of the Labour left in exile. Tony Benn is among his heroes. </p> <p>It is no accident that his co-sponsors of the Bill to abolish warrant sales are John McAllion, the often dissident Labour MSP, and Alex Neil, who is standing on a left-wing ticket for the SNP leadership. Tommy Sheridan has his eyes on the fringes of both the main parties and may yet emerge as a strategic figure capable of uniting the Scottish left.</p>",
  "Next weekend one thousand refugees, asylum-seekers, members of ethnic minority groups and the traveller community will converge at the Point Depot in Dublin to share in a celebration of one of Ireland's most successful exports - Riverdance. <p>The spectacular tapping, stamping, swirling show is at the end of a highly successful 'Homecoming' run. The company's grand finale, before it sets off on another international tour of Europe and the Far East, is to contribute its collective talents to the launch of a campaign against racism and prejudice in Ireland. </p> <p>There will be two performances next weekend. At the first, on Saturday, half the audience will be made up of members of minority groups. The second, on Sunday evening, will be a charity performance with the title Riverdance - Le Cheile (Together). It will launch Artists against Racism in Ireland, and all proceeds will go to a year-long education programme in community groups and schools across the country. </p> <p>The idea came from artist Robert Ballagh, who has designed all the productions of Riverdance, and Moya Doherty, the show's producer. Like many others, they have been shocked by increasing racist attacks and hostility to refugees and asylum-seekers. </p> <p>The production of Riverdance , now playing to packed houses at The Point, emphasises the experience of Irish emigrants seeking a better life, and the intermingling of cultures in the New World. There are Afro-American, Russian and Spanish dancers adding an international flavour to the fast, frenetic pace of the Irish performers. </p> <p>Ballagh and Doherty approached Comhlamh, an organisation of returned aid workers from developing countries. They hope to set up a campaign harnessing the talents of Irish artists to combat racism. On Sunday night there will be messages of support from Kofi Annan, the UN Secretary-General, and Mary Robinson, the former President of Ireland, who is now UN Commissioner of Human Rights. </p> <p>There are three different productions of Riverdance across the world. The show, which started as a filler between votes at the Eurovision Song Contest, has brought audiences in Japan, Australia and North America to their feet. </p> <p>Last month Niall Andrews, a Fianna Fail member of the European Parliament, asked Bertie Ahern to introduce an anti-racism pledge for all the party's candidates in the next general election. </p> <p>Amnesty International has noted with concern the growing number of racially motivated attacks. The African Refugee Council claimed more than a third of the people it questioned for a survey reported experiences of racial abuse and harassment. </p> <p>The problem is not confined to asylum-seekers. There is a growing number of foreigners, black and white, who have come to work in Ireland as a result of the country's economic success. One of the cases highlighted in the advertisements for next Sunday's Riverdance benefit concerns a 29-year-old man who is working in Ireland and who was attacked by youths at a Dublin bus stop after he told them he was German. </p> <p>Ireland is becoming an increasingly multiracial, multicultural society. The growth of the Celtic tiger economy will need more foreign workers to sustain it. </p> <p>To paraphrase Gerry Adams in another context, they are not going to go away, you know. The challenge to the Irish, particularily relevant because of our own historical experience as emigrants, is whether we see this diversity as an opportunity to enrich our society or a threat to traditional values. </p> <p>While many reports have focused on hostile protests against refugees, there have also been efforts by local community groups to make newcomers feel welcome. </p> <p>But there has been a lack of political leadership to campaign against racism. Perhaps the first fast and perfectly syncopated steps towards that goal will be taken next weekend as Riverdance taps out its multicultural message of inclusion. </p> <p>\u0095 Tickets for Sunday's performance, price \u00a330, are available from the Point Depot Box Office: 01-8363633.</p>",
  "<p>Although he presents himself as an environmentalist guru, Al Gore has always been enthusiastic about genetically modified 'Frankenfoods' - and for many good reasons. One might be that he himself is a GM product. No man in the history of American politics can have been so carefully and deliberately groomed, moulded, deconstructed and reconstructed for the Presidential race for which Al 'GM' Gore presents himself at the Democrat convention, opening in Los Angeles tomorrow. </p> <p>When Gore arrived for his first day as a journalist on the Nashville Tennessean newspaper in the autumn of 1971, most staff knew he was no regular cub reporter. Gore was being packaged to them as the young man who had just returned from his stint in Vietnam - wearing his country's uniform although he bitterly criticised its war - now making his way in the world free from the overbearing family tradition of politics. In contrast to the cynical realpolitik practiced by his father, Senator Albert Gore I, Al Gore II had studied esoteric spiritualism. He was a decent enough reporter too - he pursued a local corruption case all the way to a court hearing (although the target was acquitted). </p> <p>But the package was a deceptive one. Had he really wanted to go into journalism, the Harvard-educated Gore could have walked into other, more prestigious newsrooms than that which happened to have been in his father's political back-pocket in Nashville. The editor of the Nashville Tennessean was John Siegenthaler, who employed celebrity interns who would enhance his own contacts in Washington. </p> <p>In Vietnam, Gore's father had been able to pull a few strings (although without such sordid efficiency as George Bush's) and secured Gore a job as an army reporter. Accordingly, he had been mollycoddled around, a safe distance from the action which he reported in vivid detail from second-hand accounts. 'Gore was not the journalist type,' recalls his former colleague on the desk, Phil Sullivan. 'It didn't seem like that was what he was setting out to do. Siegenthaler saw him as someone who was going into politics.' </p> <p>But although his colleagues knew exactly what he was up to, Gore himself could have had no idea that the more relaxed and apparently self-confident summer intern sitting at the next desk would, in two decades time, be the man to whom he would turn for yet another in the long series of makeovers that would define his career: Carter Eskew, 'message guru' of the current campaign, laboratory technician of the present-day GM Gore and Svengali of the LA convention. </p> <p>It is hard to know which aspects of Al Gore's life are fact and which are fanciful, or indeed whether there is any difference between the two. Gore himself plays along with the entwinement, turning even the rawest and most intimate moments of his life - such as his own son's scrape with death in a car accident - into theatrics, part of the electoral strategy. </p> <p>The packaging of Al Gore as President of the United States began when he was still in utero. On the day Gore was born, the Nashville Tennessean hailed the birth on page one: 'Well, Mr Gore, Here He Is', with the Knoxville News Sentinel adding only a year or two later: 'There may be another Gore on his way to the political pinnacle.' </p> <p>Gore grew up not in Tennessee but in what is now the Ritz Carlton Hotel on Embassy Row in Washington DC, attending an \u00e9lite prep school and spending summers on the tobacco farm in his father's home state. He played with a toy submarine in the Senate swimming-pool and bounced on President Nixon's lap. Albert Snr was a rags-to-riches, Scots-Irish politician, a New Dealer unafraid of unpopular positing and ultimately defeated after an 18-year career only when Nixon unleashed a slush of illegal finance against him, as revealed by the Watergate papers. Like his son, he enjoyed taking the ethical high ground and like his son he betrayed it. But it was Gore's mother, Pauline, who claimed the initial packaging of her son - 'I trained them both,' she said of Alberts I and II, 'and I did a better job on my son than I did on my husband.' </p> <p>The most striking thing about packaging Al Gore is the regularity with which it happens and the extent of the metamorphoses. The most dramatic was the apparent conversion from new-age eco-catastrophist to Vice-President in 1992 and, more recently, from a woodentop with as much political razzmatazz as a traffic jam to something from Sopranos central casting. </p> <p>The task in 1992 was particularly daunting and almost effective. Gore pre sented a curious figure at the time, as expressed in his book, Earth in the Balance . It was published at a time when politicians were full of foreboding about the various apocalypses of global warming, over-population and ozone-depletion and making routine pilgrimages to the Amazon rainforest. </p> <p>Gore had been understandably affected by his son's narrow scrape with death after a car hit the child as the family was leaving a Baltimore Orioles baseball game. He had immersed himself in alternative psychotherapy, new-age thought and the fad philosophy of Gaia, popular among right-wing eco-catastrophists, suggesting that the human race is merely part of a single, natural organism. </p> <p>'It cannot be accidental,' wrote Gore in one of his more wayward passages, 'that the percentage of salt in our bloodstreams is the same as the percentage in the oceans of the world.' Gore laments mankind's alienation from this natural order, putting the blame squarely on Ren\u00e9 Descartes. Quite apart from its intellectual absurdity, Gore's position had two curiosities: the fact that it did not put off the embryonic Clinton administration and its brazen disingenuousness. </p> <p>On his 1998 tax return, Al Gore lists a $20,000 royalty payment from the Union Zinc Company for the right to mine zinc on his farm in Tennessee. The income, which has netted Gore $450,000 over the years, is the legacy of Gore Snr's lucrative relationship and joint ventures with fraudulent tycoon and Soviet agent, Armand Hammer, also chief executive of the environmentally controversial Occidental Petroleum Company. Among other ironies, Hammer was caught making illegal contributions to Nixon, used to topple Gore Snr. Hammer and Gore Snr enjoyed a two-way deal: Hammer boasted that he had Gore in his 'back-pocket'; he found protection from anti-communist investigations and open doors in Washington; Gore Snr secured campaign funds, a six-figure directorship upon retirement and donations for his son's Congressional campaigns. </p> <p>After hosting Gore and Tipper at innumerable parties, and being Al's guest at Ronald Reagan's inauguration in 1987, Hammer died in 1990. But the $20,000 a year was a handsome supplement to what Gore complained were 'slave wages' on the Tennessean , and still listed in 1992 as his most important source of income after his salary, now eclipsed by the $1.1 million in royalties from Earth in the Balance . </p> <p>The relationship between Gore and Occidental has remained a mutually advantageous one. Occidental loaned $100,000 to the Clinton-Gore inaugural committee in 1992, and has donated some $500,000 in 'soft money' to the Democratic Party since Gore made it on to the ticket. </p> <p>This was the administration-in-waiting that decided it needed Al Gore on the ticket. When he took the initial call from scout Warren Christopher, Gore was attending the Rio Earth Summit in 1991, waving his copy of Earth in the Balance . Baby-boomer Clinton liked the generational chemistry with Gore, and the Vietnam 'record' which, on paper, contrasted with his own. Gore appealed to the 'new Democrat' right wing for a number of reasons. He had been recruited by the party as an attack dog to see off Jesse Jackson's candidacy in 1988 and had done a good enough job. Even then, Clinton also needed someone with a stable marriage to offset his embarrassment over Gennifer Flowers. </p> <p>Gore was duly put through the mill, drilled into shape even by people who disliked him at the political core of Clinton's campaign: Hillary, James Carville and George Stephanopoulos. He was worked over by speech coaches and a ballet choreographer, who counselled him on his awkward movements. The wrathful impatience with conventional politics sketched in Earth in the Balance was silenced as the book became the first ever bestseller that a publisher refrained from pushing. Clinton liked the volume, but Carville, Harold Ickes and the realists on the party's Left, trying to win an election, found it insane at best, scary at worst. Gore the Rainbow Warrior duly became Gore the Vice-President. </p> <p>But what kind of packaging was it? The nadir of Gore's life-as-theatre came at the party convention in New York that year, Gore's 'coming-out' event. He told the delegates and viewing millions how he had watched Albert Gore III 'fly 30 feet through the air and scrape along the pavement... I ran to his side and held him and called his name... his eyes were open with the nothingness state of death'. Gore was reading every word off the autocue. </p> <p>The history of Vice-Presidents assuming the top office is a patchy one, as Pauline Gore must have realised when she expressed coded disapproval of her son's supporting role to the 'provincial' Bill Clinton. It was a concept in promotion pioneered by the shock of Truman's takeover from Franklin Roosevelt and L.B.J.'s even more dramatic succession of J.F. Kennedy, but these were without preparation. It worked differently in the more ambitious cases of Nixon, first of the 'modern' Vice-Presidents, and George Bush. </p> <p>A year ago, a lifetime of grooming 'Veep' Al Gore for the presidency seemed doomed to failure. A bumper sticker appeared: 'Stuck in Traffic? Blame Al Gore'. Gore had creased the nation's sides by telling CNN's Wolf Blitzer he had 'taken the initiative in creating the internet'. Hillary Clinton's candidacy in New York created a Medusan triangle inside the White House with resentments in all directions. Most importantly, Gore was making instantly and utterly forgettable speeches: 'Gore' was spelled with a 'B'. </p> <p>A Wagnerian family psychodrama was playing out between Clinton and Gore - 'father' and 'son' - which was, with hindsight, crucial to Gore's selection of running mate last week. Throughout the Lewinsky scandal, Gore had walked a high wire between loyalty and disgust. Apart from Hillary, he was the most senior victim of the President's deceit but also had the highest honour under Clinton's patronage to betray if he abandoned him. </p> <p>Gore's political father (Clinton) finally blessed Gore's ambition to become President in 1998, the year that his actual father died, thereby turning Clinton's political paternity into something more complex. Gore always knew that his success lay in the passing of power by both to him, as George Bush Snr has done to his son. But there was a problem - the motives of both Gore's father figures were entirely narcissistic. One wanted a President Gore who would bear the family name in the White House, the other a President Gore to rescue his legacy from the stains on Monica's dress. </p> <p>In his hour of need, Gore was shunned by the surrogate father in a way he never was by Albert Snr. Out of the blue, Clinton made an unsolicited call to the New York Times, making clear his displeasure at the way Gore was conducting his campaign. On the morning his remarks were published, the atmosphere in Gore's White House office was one of 'stunned disbelief'. Meanwhile, down the corridor, Gore had been shut out of the huddle that gathered around the President to discuss the advisability and fallout of the Times interview. Gore's retort came sharp enough. He told Diane Sawyer he thought Clinton's behaviour during the Lewinsky scandal had been 'inexcusable... especially as a father'. </p> <p>Gore assembled a team with specific instructions - to repackage him again, almost from scratch. One source told The Observer that Gore himself even admitted privately that 'I would not vote for the Al Gore I read about'. A war council was convened by the new campaign director, Tony Coelho, a former Congressman dogged by allegations of embezzlement and scandal, to do just that. With Coelho was Bob Shrum, former wordsmith for Teddy Kennedy who will have written Gore's sink-or-swim Los Angeles speech; Gore's daughter, Karenna Gore Schriff, and wife, Tipper; Eskew and stringent political director Donna Brazile, who acted as pastor and conscience to the otherwise devious bunch. </p> <p>According to one present at the meeting, the message was to 'free Gore from his office and from the White House' - to declare UDI from Bill and Hillary. Gore moved his campaign headquarters from Washington to his supposed 'roots' in Tennessee. The move was also a good way to cull a troubled, squabbling staff, to sort out the wheat prepared to sacrifice everything to follow him from the chaff who preferred to stay around their DC dinner tables. Brazile added a trial by salary, cutting everybody's by two-thirds. Gore and his senior staff remained in the comfort of Washington. </p> <p>Diane Sawyer conducted the first TV interview in Tennessee with Gore and Tipper on his late father's tobacco farm. Gore wore jeans and cowboy boots. Sawyer threw the first pitch, a fastball. Her grandmother, she said, who was in tobacco farming, wanted to ask: how many strains of tobacco are there in the US? Gore stared back blankly, a look of wounded hatred in his eyes. The second question was about the maintenance of fencing between two properties; Gore was equally clueless. </p> <p>Addressing the crowds at his launch rally in Tennessee, Gore pledged to 'take my own values of faith and family to the Presidency' and promised: 'If you entrust me with the Presidency, I will marshal its authority, its resources and its moral leadership to fight for America's family.' It was a brazen slap in Clinton's face. Gore's campaign hit the road with speeches luxuriating in the strong economy, but barely mentioning Clinton. He needed to share in the President's public successes (and stubborn popularity among Americans) while denouncing his private failings. </p> <p>Winter came, and the packaging team devised a new, folksy Al Gore who stopped talking about 'livability' and held town meetings and his audience to raise their hands until he had identified who had the most grandchildren. As the jester of American politician-watching, Professor Todd Gitlin at New York University, puts it: 'The difference between Bush and Gore now is that Bush is fake trying to be real, while Gore is real trying to be fake.' </p> <p>But even the 'fake' package had trouble selling himself. Gore was tainted by the Russian money-laundering scandal. A photo opportunity in a canoe backfired when it emerged that 170 million gallons of water had been released to stage it, during a drought. Bill Bradley was making headway he simply didn't deserve. Coelho's tyrannical style was driving the team to distraction to no effect; he was hardly the Carville figure the campaign so obviously needed. There was bitter internal strife between one-time partners Eskew and the (now late) Bob Squier, policy adviser. The two men had once run a consultancy together but their combined presence on the Gore campaign was, said old White House hand Dick Morris 'like asking the Albanians and Serbs to work together'. Then came a final split from Bill, a bit of the sex appeal and the final makeover. </p> <p>The Gores had decided that marital bliss was the key to the post-Monica era, but now they added a bit of libido to their version. On stage, Tipper would summon him with a wave of her hand, saying: 'He's so sexy', and he would respond: 'I love it when she beckons me with her finger like that.' The chic feminist Naomi Wolf was recruited to refurbish Gore's wardrobe and promote his sexual chem istry from what she labelled 'Beta to Alpha' grade. </p> <p>It seemed to work. Brazile's puritanism played counterpoint to this flippancy. Gore became almost a control freak over his campaign, designing his own logos and websites. The result appeared on television during the New Hampshire primary opposite Bill Bradley. To the nation's amazement, Gore suddenly looked hunky, like a football quarterback dressed as a small-time Mafiosi. He was confident yet relaxed. </p> <p>Gore has since applied the new style to new crusades, none more virulently than that against America's drugs and medicines industry. Gore lambasts the pharmaceutical companies for 'gouging the consumer unfairly' and claims credit for a recent industry retreat in agreeing to allow South Africa and other countries to manufacture cheaper generic drugs to counter the Aids pandemic. But even this genetic modification is flawed because, as ever with Gore, it is disingenuous. Gore's claim that he pushed for the generic production of Aids medicines in South Africa is especially unconvincing. Last December, The Observer revealed the web of consultancies and lobbying that connected Gore to the major drug producers suing the South African government for trying to produce generics. </p> <p>This campaign is the final act in Gore's lifelong White House drama. The first scene has already been successfully played out: the overdue shedding of Coelho and his replacement by William Daley, a rough-cut professional and one of America's fourth dynasty after the Kennedys, Bushes, Gores, that of the past and present mayors of Chicago, Richard Daley Snr and Jr. If anyone can save Gore, it is Daley, as Gore must have known when he called him shortly after midnight to offer him the job. A groggy Daley said he'd like to think about it over a cup of coffee. 'OK,' replied Gore, 'go get your coffee and I'll hold.' </p> <p>The second scene was concluded last week with Lieberman's appointment. But this only complicates the third scene, which opens in Los Angeles tomorrow - that which is supposed to star President Al Gore, but in which President Bill Clinton will inevitably play centre stage. That was always the problem in packaging Al Gore - fathers. </p> <p>If this was Wagner, the aged, flawed Wotan would be standing at the foot of the mountain, spear in hand. Young Siegfried would slice it in half and Wotan would say: 'Pass on, for I cannot stop you.' But Al Gore Snr never taught his son how to use the sword, and neither did Bill Clinton. In the end, it was they who did the packaging, and neither was prepared, in the final hour, to be outshone by Al Gore.</p>"
