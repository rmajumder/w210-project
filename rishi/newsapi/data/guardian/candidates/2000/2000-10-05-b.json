  "There is speculation that Slobodan Milosevic has left Yugoslavia as reports claim that three large planes have left Belgrade's military airport. <p>Serbia is on the brink of revolution, after anti-government demonstrators seized control of the parliament building in Belgrade and set it on fire.</p> <p>But the Yugoslav army has said that it will not intervene to halt the demonstrations, adding to hopes that Mr Milosevic's regime has collapsed.</p> <p>In what could be the endgame for President Slobodan Milosevic, demonstrators said dozens of police at the federal parliament and the state-run TV station had joined crowds taking control of both buildings.</p> <p>State television came back on air at about 8pm London time, apparently under opposition control.</p> <p>There are unconfirmed reports that the Yugolsav army has been in contact with the opposition crisis committee, according to the B92 radio station. </p> <p>Opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica this evening appealed for calm and urged demonstrators to return to work tomorrow, amid signs that he had lost control of the protests against Mr Milosevic\u00d5s continuing rule. There are fears of large-scale bloodshed tonight if Mr Milosevic orders tanks on to the streets, a tactic he used to quell an uprising in March 1991.</p> <p>In what is said to be the biggest uprising in 13 years of Mr Milosevic\u00d5s rule, gunfire has been heard in front of the TV building, with one person reported killed and several wounded. </p> <p>Protesters quickly established control of the parliament building as police fled or surrendered. Demonstrators inside the parliament threw pictures of President Milosevic into the streets.</p> <p>Later, the first main TV programme went off the air, leaving television screens black. The second programme also was interrupted. </p> <p>Before ebbing, clashes spread through the streets of the capital, which echoed with the sound of stun grenades and tear gas fired to break up the crowds. The Beta news agency reported that \"several dozen\" people had been admitted to emergency wards. </p> <p>A bulldozer, commandeered by demonstrators, broke into the TV building, driving over a protester and apparently killing him. Demonstrators poured inside, as police fled out the back. </p> <p>Today\u00d5s protest saw scenes reminiscent of the 1989 revolution in Romania that overthrew Nicolai Ceausescu. It is the most serious unrest in the campaign of civil disobedience that erupted after last month's election, which Mr Kostunica is considered to have won. Mr Milosevic has refused to concede defeat and has threatened to remain in power until the end of his mandate next year.</p> <p>Violence erupted at the start of a huge rally which the opposition called to force Mr Milosevic to accept electoral defeat. Hundreds of thousands had assembled less than an hour before the rally was to begin, and tens of thousands more streamed into the city. </p> <p>Police had already fired tear gas at a group of protesters who tried to push their way into the domed building earlier in the afternoon. </p> <p>\"At this moment, terror rules in Belgrade,\" the pro-Milosevic government television said in a commentary. \"They are attacking everyone they see on the streets and there is chaos.\" </p> <p>Tensions rose after the Yugoslav constitutional court issued a ruling which one judge reportedly said nullified the September ballot. </p> <p> Elsewhere in Serbia, thousands more joined smaller rallies in towns throughout the country. In the third largest city, Nis, about 10,000 people tried to push their way into the local office of Mr Milosevic's party but were persuaded by opposition leaders not to give police a reason to attack them. </p> <p> By early afternoon, central Belgrade was packed, with many people streaming toward the parliament building and blocking traffic as they did so. Many wore paper caps with the slogan, \"We'll Endure.\" They moved past shops, some shut down with signs stating, \"Closed because of robbery\" - an allusion to opposition claims that Mr Milosevic stole the elections. </p> <p> In what the opposition hoped was a further sign the regime was crumbling, more than 160 employees of Serbian state television - a major pillar of Mr Milosevic's power - were sacked after going on strike. Most were technicians and staff of non-political programmes. Most Milosevic loyalists remained, and kept the network on the air. </p>",
  "Tony Blair today called in a statement for Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to stand down. <p>Outside Downing Street as he left for Warsaw tonight, Mr Blair said: \"The verdict from the elections was clear. The verdict on the streets is clear. The message for Milosevic is clear. </p> <p>\"Go. Go now. Go before any more lives are lost, before there is any more destruction. </p> <p>\"And I say this to the people of Serbia, whatever the differences that have been between us. </p> <p>\"Now that you have reached for democracy, the hand of friendship and partnership from countries like Britain is there for you, so that together, in whatever way we can, we will rebuild this troubled part of Europe and secure a peaceful and prosperous future for all the people there.\" </p> <p>Foreign Secretary Robin Cook delivered a similar uncompromising message to the Yugoslav leader challenging him to go and go quickly. </p> <p>US President Clinton, meanwhile, ruled out US military intervention in Yugoslavia in a formal statement, confirming Mr Cook's earlier remark to that effect. </p> <p>Mr Clinton branded Milosevic's regime \"a hardcore dictatorship\" and said: \"I think the people are trying to get their country back, and we support democracy and the will of the Serbian people.\" </p> <p>Speaking with reporters in the White House's rose garden after an education event, the president said: \"All we want for the Serbian people (is)...the right to freely choose their own leaders.\" </p> <p>Asked if the United States might intervene militarily, he said, \"I don't believe it's an appropriate case for military intervention.\" He said the United States should not do or say anything that would strengthen Milosevic. </p> <p>Mr Cook made it clear that western governments would not intervene to spare the president prosecution by the war crimes tribunal in a deal to make him stand down in favour of the opposition leader, Vojislav Kostunica, widely believed to have won the election 10 days ago. </p> <p>\"Ten days ago the people of Serbia rejected Milosevic at the ballot box. Today they have rejected him on the streets of Belgrade,\" Mr Cook said. </p> <p>\"It is a powerful demonstration of the extent to which across Serbia, not just in Belgrade, people reject Milosevic as president. </p> <p>\"Milosevic was unpopular at the time of the ballot, 10 days ago. </p> <p>\"Now he is evidently held in even greater contempt by the people because of his attempts to rob them of their votes.\" </p> <p>Speaking at the Conservative conference in Bournemouth today, Shadow Foreign Secretary Francis Maude said: \"This is the last desperate attempt by Slobodan Milosevic to buy time and exhaust his opponents.\" </p> <p>Speaking in London Mr Cook repeated the message. </p> <p>\"Everyone else in Serbia knows that Milosevic has lost any right to office. If Milosevic dares go to his window today, he will see the people want him out,\" Mr Cook told reporters. </p> <p>\"Milosevic must go, the only question now is how and when he goes. </p> <p>\"The sooner he goes, the sooner we can get on with the fresh start we want for the people of Serbia, rebuilding their country and rebuilding bridges with a modern Europe. Today's demonstrations were markedly different from previous opposition action,\" Mr Cook said. </p> <p>\"He is confronted today not just with words but possibly a million people on the streets calling for him to go and he is confronted across the country with industrial action,\" the foreign secretary said. </p> <p>However, he ruled out direction action to aid the protesters in their struggle with the security forces. </p> <p>\"I'm not making threats. The last thing that would be helpful for the people of Serbia today is threats. That is what he wants,\" he said. </p> <p>Asked about the possibility of a war crimes amnesty to ease Milosevic's exit from office, Mr Cook said: \"It is not a matter for governments, it is a matter for the war crimes tribunal.\"</p> <p>Separately, Germany called on the Yugoslav army and security forces not to use force against protesters demanding that President Slobodan Milosevic step down, according to Reuters.</p> <p>\"Milosevic has lost the elections,\" Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said in a statement. \"Now the way must be cleared for the will of the Serbian people to take effect. The army and police, too, must respect the will of the Yugoslavs and should not use force against the people.\"</p>",
  "Serbian police have clashed briefly with protesters who tried to enter the Yugoslav parliament building a few hours before a huge anti-government rally in Belgrade, according to the latest reports. <p>The situation has calmed down, with several protesters hugging police in a bid to win them over. But the incident seemed to signal a build-up in public pressure ahead of a demonstration due to start at 2pm BST aimed at forcing Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to accept defeat in the presidential election. </p> <p>Eyewitnesses said police, who have shown unusual restraint during this week's campaign of civil disobedience, seemed to have reacted only when some protesters had pushed through one line of police and appeared to be trying to enter the building. </p> <p>Shortly after the incident, the crowd outside the building swelled to more than 10,000. At one point some of them hurled stones at police before tension eased. About 150 riot police lined up around the building. </p> <p>One opposition leader, Velja Ilic, urged people not to provoke incidents. \"I beg you not to hurl stones at the police. There was an incident because someone stoned a policeman just now. They are ours, they have to be with their people, so please do not provoke any incident,\" Ilic told the crowd. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Yugoslav constitutional court says the presidential poll must be repeated. </p> <p>The ruling confirms an initial judgment by the court late yesterday, which invalidated part of the 24 September elections, a ballot Milosevic opponents say was won outright by his rival Vojislav Kostunica. </p> <p>It was not immediately clear if this means a complete repeat of the elections would be required. A run-off election was scheduled for Sunday, but opposition forces said they would boycott the vote. </p> <p>Tens of thousands of protesters seeking to oust President Slobodan Milosevic streamed toward the capital today to join a mass rally billed as the final push against the embattled strongman. </p> <p>Police offered little resistance to the largest convoys but appeared to stand firm to some of the smaller groups. A convoy of about 2,000 people was blocked near the town of Smederevska Palanka about 30 miles south of Belgrade. </p> <p>Independent radio B2-92 said police were blocking a main highway just outside Nis, the third-largest city, from which dozens of buses and cars were trying to reach the capital. Some of the crowds appeared too big to stop. </p> <p>Protesters used a front-end loader to shove aside two sand trucks used by authorities to try to block a 12-mile line of cars and buses with about 15,000 people travelling from the opposition stronghold of Cacak. Riot police stood by without intervening. </p> <p>At another roadblock, trucks were pushed away and demonstrators negotiated with a police commander to be allowed through. At yet another blockade, angry protesters overturned a police car and dumped it into a ditch. </p> <p>Opposition leaders issued an \"ultimatum; for Milosevic to resign by 2pm BST today - the time set for the Belgrade rally. \"This flame will engulf the whole of Belgrade,\" said Vladan Batic, an opposition leader. </p> <p>Although authorities appear unwilling to strike back at the crowds, Milosevic turned to other options to try to cling to power. </p> <p>The constitutional court ruling - by judges loyal to the president - could be aimed at allowing Milosevic to stay in power longer. His term would have expired next June if he hadn't called early elections and now he might be trying to get back to the previous status as if the elections didn't take place. </p> <p>Milosevic's government conceded that Kostunica gained more votes than Milosevic, but that he failed to win the majority legally required for outright victory. </p> <p>The court ruling came just hours after police were forced to abandoned plans to take over a striking coal mine after confronting fearless anti-Milosevic crowds - a stunning development unprecedented in a former communist nation with no history of major worker uprisings. </p> <p>\"He saw that he cannot push through the second round against the majority of the people,\" opposition campaign manager Zoran Djindjic said of Milosevic. \"His solution is ... to create a new situation for totally new elections; allowing him to cling to power for further months. </p> <p>The tribunal met in emergency session to hear claims by the 18-party opposition coalition that Milosevic's cronies manipulated election results by using a sophisticated software program. </p> <p>Even before the court ruling, however, Milosevic, showed no signs he was contemplating defeat. His prime minister, Momir Bulatovic, repeated the position that Milosevic can remain in office until June 2001 regardless of the election outcome, which is when Milosevic's present term runs out.</p>",
  "Ever since Richard Nixon broke into a cold, grey sweat next to a fresh-faced John Kennedy forty years ago, television coverage of live presidential debates in the run-up to the elections has been more or less guaranteed across America. <p>Until this week, that is. Two of America's four major television networks - NBC and Fox - decided not to offer live coverage of Tuesday night's face-off between Al Gore and George W Bush. Instead of watching the first debate in what is shaping up to be the closest US presidential race since 1960, viewers were offered the chance to watch a baseball game or the premiere of Dark Angel, a new sci-fi adventure featuring a genetically enhanced prototype woman.</p> <p>This decision - taken sheepishly by the National Broadcasting Corporation and with some gusto by the Rupert Murdoch-owned Fox channel - has reopened the debate about what constitutes public service broadcasting in the US. The row offers a transatlantic perspective on the industry battle between commercial organizations and government guardians as the UK debate rages on over whether the evening news should be seen at 9pm or later.</p> <p>In some ways, it is difficult for outsiders to see what all the fuss is about. Most Americans can chose between 50 and 75 television channels. Even New Yorkers offered NBC's match between the local Yankees and Oakland Athletics could watch the political debate live on no fewer than eight channels.</p> <p>The answer came in a blistering piece written by William Kennard, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, the US television watchdog, on the day of the planned debate. Under the headline 'Fox and NBC Renege on a Debt', Mr Kennard pointed out that the US congress had agreed to give public broadcasters extra spectrum to provide the next wave of digital television services four years ago as long as they continued to 'serve the public interest'. He estimated the commercial value of this extra air space at more than $70bn and added there was \"no underestimating\" the value of televised political debates.</p> <p>Put simply, while America's numerous cable channels are allowed to offer as much entertainment as they want, public broadcasters are not because they receive licenses from the government to use the public airwaves. </p> <p>\"As trustees of the public airwaves, the networks must do more than just entertain: they must also serve the needs of citizens by facilitating an informed democratic process\" wrote Mr Kennard. He ended his article in the New York Times with a warning that \"in the future, the networks should remember that the public interest is far more important than their financial interest.\"</p> <p>Fox, which does not intend to show any of the three planned presidential debates nor the vice-presidential one tonight, made a new offer as Mr Kennard's article was going to print. The station offered each of the contenders a blank half-hour slot on prime-time Friday night television at the end of October to answer the question: 'Why should Americans vote for you?' </p> <p>Given that one of the participants himself - George W Bush - failed to change the allotted slot for air time agreed by the bipartisan debate committee, this plan is unlikely to change the official timetable. </p> <p>Neither the FCC, nor the candidates, has replied to it. Indeed, the FCC, which has the power to revoke a network's public broadcasting license, has said little about the entire issue since the publication of Mr Kennard's article. </p> <p>Television executives mutter that in the age of the internet, where there is so much choice over what to watch and when, the notion of public service is irrelevant anyway. \"There's only a finite number of people who want to watch the debates,\" said one, who nevertheless refused to be named.</p> <p>In the end, an estimated 75m people watched the first live debate of this year's election. With both NBC and Fox sticking to their plans not to offer live coverage, however, the debates could end with fewer viewers than a ball game and a Lara Croft-lookalike. If so, it will be a close-run thing to see which contestant turns grey and clammy first in the battle ahead between the government and the television industry.</p>",
  "In what appeared to be the latest ploy to buy time for the president, Yugoslavia's highest court invalidated part of the September 24 presidential elections, which Milosevic's opponents say was won outright by his rival Vojislav Kostunica. It was not immediately clear if this means a complete rerun of the elections will be required. The court is to release a full ruling on Thursday. <p>The constitutional court ruling - by judges loyal to the president - could be aimed at allowing Milosevic to stay in power longer; his term does not expire until the middle of next year, which leaves him free to set a new election date any time before then. Milosevic's government conceded that Kostunica gained more votes than Milosevic, but not a large enough margin to allow him to avoid a second round of voting. The opposition said it would boycott a second round. </p> <p>The unexpected court ruling appeared calculated to help Milosevic regain the upper hand after losing ground in growing popular protests against his rule. </p> <p>Police on Wednesday were forced to abandoned plans to take over a striking coal mine after confronting fearless anti-Milosevic crowds - a stunning development unprecedented in a former communist nation with no history of major worker uprisings. </p> <p>The court ruling on Wednesday infuriated opposition leaders. \"He saw that he cannot push through the second round against the majority of the people,\" opposition campaign manager Zoran Djindjic said of Milosevic, adding: \"His solution is ... to create a new situation for totally new elections; allowing him to cling to power for further months.\"</p> <p>Ironically, the court ruling was indirectly initiated by the opposition after it pressed its claims of election fraud before the judges. The tribunal met in emergency session to hear claims by the 18-party opposition coalition that Milosevic's cronies manipulated election results by using a sophisticated software program, a copy of which opposition leaders claimed to have obtained. </p> <p>Even before the court ruling, passions were high. Zoran Zivkovic, the mayor of Nis, the nation's third largest city, said any violence on the part of Milosevic's forces Thursday would be met by violence from crowds. \"I'm telling the army and police that we won't stop,\" said Zivkovic, addressing 30,000 anti-Milosevic demonstrators in Nis on Wednesday. \"We are going to Belgrade to finish off what we had started in the elections.\" </p> <p>Before the court's decision was announced, top opposition figures had been buoyed by the police capitulation at the Kolubara mine complex. They rushed to join more than 10,000 protesters there and openly predicted Milosevic's quick demise. \"Serbia has risen so that one man would leave,\" Kostunica told cheering workers and their supporters at the Kolubara mine near Lazarevac, about 25 miles south of Belgrade. </p> <p>Opposition leaders issued an ultimatum for Milosevic to resign by 3pm on Thursday - the time set for the Belgrade rally. \"This flame will engulf the whole of Belgrade,\" said Vladan Batic, an opposition leader. </p> <p>Police in riot gear had occupied the strip mine complex in an attempt to break up the largest of the nationwide strikes against Milosevic, but were unable to contain a swelling crowd that heeded the workers' cry for help. With sunset approaching, the police gave up. Most police withdrew from their barricades and mingled with strikers inside the compound. </p> <p>The mine walkout was the forerunner of other strikes; state telecommunications company workers announced they would stay away from work, and city bus drivers and garbage collectors in Belgrade also refused to work. It is the first widespread strike action in Yugoslavia's 55-year history. </p> <p>In an open letter to Milosevic, Kostunica said, \"It will be better for you to recognize electoral defeat or risk the danger of open clashes nationwide.\"</p> <p>Even before the court ruling, however, Milosevic, showed no signs he was contemplating defeat. His prime minister, Momir Bulatovic, repeated the position that Milosevic can remain in office until June 2001 regardless of the election outcome.</p>",
  "What do American voters really want in a president? Try thinking of a small ad in the personal columns. \"Large, fickle, undecided electorate, no stranger to heartbreak, WLTM easy-going, mentally-balanced middle-aged male, N/S, with GSOH, with view to four-year relationship, domestic bliss, and world domination. Must be brave, smart, and good-looking (like Harrison Ford in Air Force One), trustworthy (not like Richard Nixon), and real tough on invaders from outer space (as in Independence Day). Must like dogs, log fires, Elvis, the NFL, tax cuts and surgical strikes. And must be able to keep flies buttoned (unlike You Know Who). Please send photo.\" But what do these lonely hearts actually get? Judging by the first-date TV debate between Al Gore and George W Bush, they get two identically dressed fellas so totally prepped, coached and spun, they hardly know who they are any more. <p>Mr Bush (the nervous one from Texas) scored a lot of positive negatives. He was gaffe-free, did not mistake Tiananmen Square for a board game and figured (correctly) that Slobodan is the bad guy. Even his mud-slinging about the \"character issue\" was more pat-a-cake than killer punch. Mr Gore (the one with the undertaker's voice) did not do a lot of stuff, too. He managed not to frighten the horses (or those crazy soccer moms) and did not get aggressive and make George cry. After complaints that he exaggerates, the Veep eschewed claims to have invented the internet, halted global warming and to have been Burt Lancaster's role model in From Here to Eternity (with Deborah Kerr playing Tipper). </p> <p>The strait-laced debate format imposed enormous, artificial pressure on both men. Advisers warned that one slip could tip the race. Whether true or not, the result was an uptight, uninspiring performance. Yet for either to have any hope of a happy union with voters, both must cast inhibition aside on their next date, lighten up and be themselves.</p>",
  "Al Gore and George W Bush headed straight back to middle America yesterday, the day after a televised debate that underlined big political differences between the two candidates, and which saw Mr Gore consolidate his position as the favourite to win the US presidency next month. <p>Mr Bush spent the day campaigning in Pennsylvania, while Mr Gore travelled to Ohio, both key battleground states. </p> <p>Early polls yesterday showed the Democratic vice-president making inroads among undecided voters in the aftermath of the head-to-head meeting, which drew an estimated audience of more than 60m viewers. </p> <p>A poll of debate-watchers for CBS News showed that 56% thought Mr Gore performed better than his rival, compared with 42% for Mr Bush. A similar survey for CNN had Mr Gore with a 48%-41% advantage on debate performance, while an NBC poll gave Mr Gore a 46%-36% margin. </p> <p>The first of this autumn's three presidential debates will certainly have put to rest the facile notion that the 2000 election is a contest between indistinguishable candidates with a common philosophy. </p> <p>In 90 minutes of often fact-filled debate at the University of Massachusetts on Tuesday night, Mr Gore and Mr Bush set out starkly different approaches to the role of government in domestic and international affairs. </p> <p>They repeatedly drew the battle lines on issues ranging from tax cuts to abortion, and from protection of the environment to Balkans peacekeeping. </p> <p>Yesterday's press reactions were predictably varied. </p> <p>Mr Bush \"held his own in the first match\", the Dallas Morning News concluded; \"Bush got his clock cleaned\", the online magazine Slate decided; The Washington Post judged that \"both candidates cleared the bar of minimum requirements\", while the Los Angeles Times said: \"If the race is based on this debate, it remains a squeaker.\" </p> <p>There were \"surprisingly few of the usual gaffes and zingers that the public usually remembers from debates\", the New York Times said. \"Instead the powerful impression was of two advocates of different views of government.\" </p> <p>Only in the closing exchanges did the debate turn anything like personal, as Mr Bush launched an attack on his opponent's character and trustworthiness with regard to campaign fundraising. </p> <p>Mr Gore refused to be drawn into a personal exchange this time, but he may find such abstinence harder in the next debate on October 11. </p> <p>Mr Gore spent most of the evening playing to his strengths as a man familiar with the details of policy and experienced in government and foreign policy. He reeled off a bewildering list of figures on his and Mr Bush's tax plans, health-spending proposals and pension plans. </p> <p>Asked about the situation in Serbia, the vice-president talked crisply about President Slobodan Milosevic, Montenegro and opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica, words which the syllabically challenged Republican candidate carefully avoided pronouncing, probably wisely. </p> <p>Neither man made more than a passing mention of President Bill Clinton, but Mr Bush repeatedly tried to present himself as an outsider, presenting his lack of Washington experience as an asset, not a liability. </p> <p>\"You've had your chance, and nothing has been done,\" Mr Bush told his opponent. </p> <p>Before the debate began, Mr Gore's press spokesman Chris Lehane promised a contest between \"two competing visions, one for the many, the other for the few\". It was a characterisation that Mr Gore repeatedly asserted throughout the longest single section of the debate, a back-and-forth on the candidates' tax and spending plans. </p> <p>\"He would spend more money on tax cuts for the wealthiest 1% than all of the new spending that he proposes for education, healthcare, prescription drugs and national defence combined,\" Mr Gore charged. </p> <p>In an echo of a key issue from the past two presidential elections, the two candidates revealed sharp disagreements about abortion, with Mr Gore supporting women's rights to choice and Mr Bush defending \"life for the unborn\". </p> <p>With the next president perhaps having the opportunity to fill as many as four vacancies on the nine-member US supreme court during the coming years, the issue of abortion was \"on the ballot in this election\", Mr Gore claimed. </p> <p>Personal attacks were kept to a minimum until the last few minutes. As the debate drew to a close however, the moderator, Jim Lehrer, asked each man to say something about his opponent's character, drawing some critical personal comments from Mr Bush. </p> <p>\"I believe they've moved that sign 'The Buck Stops Here' from the oval office desk to 'The Buck Stops Here' on the Lincoln bedroom, and that's not good for the country,\" Mr Bush said. </p> <p>\"You may want to focus on scandals. I want to focus on results,\" responded his opponent.</p>",
  "The United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, rebuked his special envoy to Yugoslavia, Jiri Dienstbier, last night for proposing that President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia should be offered immunity from prosecution for war crimes. <p>Mr Dienstbier, the UN human rights representative in the region and a former Czech foreign minister, held out the prospect of the deal in return for Mr Milosevic standing down as president. </p> <p>Immunity would wreck the Balkans war crimes tribunal in the Hague and undermine the proposed international criminal court, which is being set up in an attempt to ensure leaders cannot escape prosecution for human rights abuses. </p> <p>If Mr Milosevic, who has been indicted by the UN for war crimes, escaped prosecution, it would be hard to sustain the case against others accused of war crimes in the Balkans, such as Radovan Karadzic, the former Bosnian Serb leader, and the Bosnian Serb General Ratko Mladic, who is wanted for genocide. </p> <p>The row over the indictment came as the US indicated that a meeting of the Contact Group on the Balkans - the US, Russia, Britain, Germany, France and Italy - was being planned for this week. The governments would be looking at ways of forcing out Mr Milosevic after his disastrous showing in last month's presidential election. </p> <p>Mr Dienstbier, who has a reputation for being outspoken, suggested that the price of immunity was worth paying to free Serbia from Mr Milosevic. </p> <p>He told reporters in Prague: \"The only possible deal, and the most important thing for Mr Milosevic, is to have guarantees that if he leaves power, he will not be prosecuted and will not spend the rest of his life somewhere in prison.\" </p> <p>He added: \"The real question is if we are more interested in Milosevic . . . or the future of 10m Serbs and probably the Balkans.\" </p> <p>His remarks raised suspicion that whatever the west might be saying publicly, in private a deal was in the offing. </p> <p>But Mr Annan said Mr Dienstbier had been speaking in a personal capacity and \"did not represent the views of the secretary general\". He added that no one other than the prosecutor had the authority to withdraw indictments. </p> <p>A Foreign Office source said there was no shift in the British position. \"We are not in the business of doing deals with Milosevic. He should be held to account in the Hague.\" </p> <p>Jim Landale, a spokesman for the UN tribunal's panel of 14 judges, described Mr Dienstbier's remarks as \"extremely disturbing\". He, too, stressed that the indictment could only be withdrawn by a judge at the request of the UN chief prosecutor, Carla del Ponte. </p> <p>Ms Del Ponte said Mr Dienstbier had no authority to propose a deal. She was at present working to expand the indictment to include even more charges of war crimes. </p> <p>Russia has invited both Mr Milosevic and Vojislav Kostunica, who won last month's election, to Moscow to discuss the impasse. The US has said that if Mr Milosevic sets foot in Moscow, Russia, as a member of the UN, should hand him over for prosecution. </p> <p>Russian officials warned yesterday that any western attempt to thwart Mr Milosevic's arrival would be viewed as a \"hostile step\" and stressed that he would not be arrested as a war criminal if he did arrive. </p> <p>Mr Kostunica also insisted that he would not hand over Mr Milosevic to the UN war crimes tribunal. </p> <p>The Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, said Mr Putin's offer on Monday to host the two Serbian rivals in mediation talks in Moscow still stood. </p> <p>But neither man has officially responded to Mr Putin's offer and the chances of a Moscow summit appeared to be receding. </p> <p>Dmitry Rogozin, the head of the Russian parliamentary affairs committee, criticised the west's calls for Russia to arrest Mr Milosevic. </p> <p>\"On the one hand the west is secretly urging Russia to influence the political situation in Yugoslavia, which is possible only within the limits of political dialogue, and on the other has publicly announced that Milosevic has to be arrested and tried,\" he said. </p> <p>He accused the west of hypocrisy and said there was no chance of Moscow handing Mr Milosevic over to the Hague. </p> <p>In an interview with a Russian newspaper, Mr Kostunica said he would not hand over Mr Milosevic. \"Because this tribunal is a political and not a legal institution. Because this conflicts with my sense of truth and justice. Because this is against the position of Yugoslavia. </p> <p>\"I could continue this list, but the Hague tribunal is not my main worry,\" he said.</p>",
  "In their first debate, Al Gore showed his ability as an experienced debater while his rival George W Bush seemed lost, disorganised, frustrated and, at times, at a loss for words. <p>The Democrat's mission was to demonstrate that there were significant issues separating the two candidates. Mr Bush, better liked as a person, needed to fudge the issue distinctions so that his more likable and charismatic personality could carry the day. </p> <p>The result: advantage Mr Gore. The vice-president demonstrated the sharp differences between the presidential candidates on a range of issues, each beneficial to his campaign. </p> <p>He succeeded in making Mr Bush's tax-cut plan seem like a giveaway to the wealthy; he showed that Mr Bush would appoint judges to the supreme court who would vote to overturn a woman's right to choose abortion; he demonstrated the superiority of his plan for free medicine for the elderly; and he raised doubts about Mr Bush's commitment to preserving the Medicare programme for seniors. </p> <p>It seemed as if Mr Bush was unprepared for the debate. Awkward, off-balance, inarticulate and flustered, the Republican nominee looked in the opening rounds as if he were on the wrong end of a Mohammad Ali jab. </p> <p>By the final third of the debate, Mr Bush had recovered somewhat, giving strong answers on the education and character issues but, by then, his performance had raised terminal doubts about his ability to serve as president. </p> <p>Mr Bush, by his hesitant and lacklustre performance in this first debate, is bound to raise questions about whether he has the brains to do the job. At times it sounded as if English was his second language. </p> <p>Like his father, George senior, Mr Bush groped for words. It was evident that his vocabulary could not keep pace with his emotions as he watched the vice-president rack up point after point in their debate. </p> <p>When Mr Gore said that the top 1% of Americans would garner half of the benefit from the Bush tax cut, the Republican contender acted as if this was the first time he had heard the argument and had no rebuttal to offer. Mr Gore repeated the charge; still no response. </p> <p>Finally, Mr Gore pointed out that Mr Bush had not answered, but all he got in return was a smirk and vague charges of \"fuzzy math\". </p> <p>Mr Gore, for his part, was his usual humourless, unrelenting, persistent, sanctimonious self. Boring, he showed a total lack of President Clinton's or President Reagan's ability to connect with people. </p> <p>But Mr Gore does know how to win a debate. He knows how to score points, frame issues, and make his opponent look bad. </p> <p>With each successful rhetorical thrust, Mr Bush was reduced to mumbling that \"he's had seven years and he hasn't done anything yet\". Normally, this rebuttal would work, but with the Clinton and Gore administration boasting a 64% approval rating, it fell flat. </p> <p>The debate does not always determine the winner - a lot can change in four weeks. There are two more debates and perhaps Mr Bush can again find his tongue. </p> <p>But, at this point in the match, it is clearly advantage Mr Gore. </p> <p> Dick Morris, chief strategist for President Clinton in his successful 1996 bid for re-election, is writing a regular column during the US election campaign.

  "Slobodan Milosevic's political allies in Montenegro dealt the Yugoslav president a blow yesterday, saying they had not yet decided whether to take part in a second round of presidential elections. <p>Arguing that the people of Serbia had clearly signalled a desire for change, the deputy chairman of Montenegro's Socialist People's party (SNP) called on Mr Milosevic to reach a compromise with the opposition regarding the contested vote. </p> <p>\"I am worried and not very happy about what is happening in Serbia,\" Predrag Bulatovic said. </p> <p>Mr Milosevic has insisted that a runoff ballot is needed in the presidential battle, rejecting assertions by the opposition leader, Vojislav Kostunica, that his party won an outright majority in the September 24 vote. </p> <p>Without saying so directly, Mr Bulatovic indicated that he thought Mr Milosevic was in the wrong. </p> <p>\"It is obvious the people of Serbia want a change,\" he said. </p> <p>Asked whether he was disappointed by the Yugoslav president's reaction to the poll, he said Mr Milosevic was facing his first election defeat. </p> <p>\"Everyone needs to get used to losing if they are a democrat,\" Mr Bulatovic said. </p> <p>Montenegro is Serbia's last remaining partner in Yugoslavia and the SNP is the republic's only mainstream party to back Mr Milosevic. </p> <p>The party's popularity has fallen in recent years thanks to its close links to the Serbian strongman, and it is currently languishing in opposition in the republic's parliament. </p> <p>Montenegro's pro-western government boycotted last month's elections, claiming the ballot was illegal; turnout in Montenegro was just 28.5%, with 91.5% of votes going to Mr Milosevic's party. </p> <p>The Serbian opposition has offered to make Mr Bulatovic prime minister if the SNP abandons Mr Milosevic ahead of the second-round vote, scheduled for October 8. </p> <p>A tired and pale-looking Mr Bulatovic said he was not interested in the position and added that his party had already agreed that its leader and current federal prime minister, Momir Bulatovic, should stay on in the post. </p> <p>However splits are opening within SNP ranks. </p> <p>Momir Bulatovic, no relative of Predrag, announced on Monday he thought a second-round vote should take place. </p> <p>However, the party's executive board met the same day and failed to agree on the need for a runoff ballot. </p> <p>Another meeting is due in the next 48 hours. </p> <p>\"It is a very complex situation. We don't know if there will be a second round and we have still not decided if we shall participate in it,\" Predrag Bulatovic said, adding that continued election controversy would fuel secessionist fires in Montenegro. </p> <p>He urged Mr Milosevic and Mr Kostunica to work out their differences, saying that if needed the Serb Orthodox Church or Russia could mediate. </p> <p>\"A compromise would be a great step forward for our democracy, but compromises are very rare among politicians of our country,\" he said. <br>Reuters</p>",
  "The former Russian president Boris Yeltsin has promised that the publication next week of the final volume of his memoirs will shed light on the backroom manoeuvring at the Kremlin which propelled the then obscure Vladimir Putin to power last year. <p>A Presidential Marathon covers Mr Yeltsin's final years in power, from the troubled presidential election campaign of 1996 to his unexpected resignation on the eve of the new millennium. </p> <p>Political analysts are waiting to see how he accounts for the crises which coloured this period: the unsatisfactory end to the first Chechen war, his frequent illnesses, the flawed privatisation process, the corruption investigations into his family and associates, and the thinking behind his decision to appoint five new prime ministers in the space of just 17 months. </p> <p>In one of his few interviews since leaving the Kremlin, Mr Yeltsin acknowledged yesterday the scale of his troubles during this time, saying the book analysed \"the years which cost me so much blood, perhaps the most difficult years of my political career\". </p> <p>But Mr Yeltsin stopped short of guaranteeing book buyers a gripping read, adding unwisely: \"I think that expos\u00e9s and sensations are not exactly my style.\" </p> <p>Translations of the book are to be published in western countries - including Britain - later this month, and the ex-president stands to boost his already substantial retirement allowance if it sells well. </p> <p>But a taster chapter published yesterday in the weekly paper Argumenty i Fakty casts doubt on quite how informative the memoirs will be - indicating rather that Mr Yeltsin is using this book, as he did the last volume, primarily as a forum for self-justification. </p> <p>Describing the days before his announcement on December 31 that he was handing power to Mr Putin, Mr Yeltsin details the reactions of his family to the news and the practical arrangements. </p> <p>But he fails to explain the fundamental question: why he thought it was necessary to abandon his post so hurriedly. </p> <p>The first person to hear Mr Yeltsin's decision to hand over power was Mr Putin, whose instant reaction was uncertainty that he was up to the responsibility. </p> <p>\"I do not think I am ready for this decision,\" Mr Yeltsin recalls him saying. \"It is a grave destiny.\" </p> <p>The ex-president, who prefers to be referred to as the first president, adds: \"This was not weakness. You couldn't call Putin weak - this was the doubt of a strong man.\" </p> <p>Since his resignation Mr Yeltsin has appeared in public only very occasionally, looking unhealthy and bloated. </p> <p>During this time, he claims to have kept a tape recorder with him at all times, dictating thoughts which fed into the work. But, like the two earlier volumes, the book was written with much assistance from a Kremlin speechwriter, Valentin Yumashev, a central figure in the Yeltsin entourage. </p> <p>Earlier this year another -decidedly more thrilling - account of Mr Yeltsin's last days in power was published in a Moscow newspaper, trailed as an exclusive extract from the forthcoming memoirs. </p> <p>A long passage including a description of how Mr Yeltsin was entranced by Mr Putin's abilities during a boar-hunting trip outside Moscow -\"He held his rifle firmly, as one holds in one's arms a woman one loves\" - was reprinted in the French newspaper Le Monde, which had failed to spot that the original piece was published on April 1.</p>",
  "Mr Fox, whose two-day visit to Britain includes talks - mainly on trade - with Tony Blair this afternoon, has already taken his message to the United States, Canada, several countries in South and central America and, earlier this week, to Paris, Madrid, Berlin and Brussels. <p>He has embraced the role of modern Mexico's first president-elect from an opposition party - the conservative National Action party - with the energy and rock solid self-belief that kept him going through years of campaigning before his July election victory. </p> <p>\"You can already feel the transformation, there is a huge amount of positive energy, and the desire to get down to work and build a great nation,\" he said before he left Mexico. </p> <p> \"We want the Europeans to know that Mexico is now a true democracy, that the corruption and the insecurity is over, and that there is a government that is positive about investment.\" </p> <p>A Jesuit-educated former Coca-Cola executive and former rancher, Mr Fox defeated the Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) after three years of sustained campaigning, chipping away at the widely held assumption that, however unpopular the 71-year regime might be, it could never lose the presidency. </p> <p>Now he is under pressure to shatter another two deeply held Mexican beliefs: that politicians never keep their promises and that power corrupts. </p> <p>\"I feel the enormous weight of peoples' expectations on my shoulders, but I am not going to run away, it doesn't frighten me,\" he said at his Mexico City headquarters, as if reciting a daily mantra. </p> <p>But governing successfully without a legislative majority, and attempting to transform a country of 100m people riddled with corruption, eaten away by poverty, and harbouring a myriad simmering conflicts will require more than determination. </p> <p>It will require all the political capital Mr Fox can muster, which is why his frenetic activity in the five months between being elected and taking office on December 1 owes as much to his need to keep the electoral feelgood factor going as it does to the nuts and bolts issues of the transition. </p> <p>Mr Fox's immediate focus is on eliminating high-level corruption and reducing violent crime. </p> <p>He admitted that reducing poverty would take longer, but insisted that peace in the troubled southern state of Chiapas could come as soon as the Zapatista rebel leader, Subcomandante Marcos, wakes up to the fact that a genuinely democratic government is now in power. </p> <p>Such upbeat talk of a post-PRI Mexican miracle has been aided by the outgoing president Ernesto Zedillo's determination to leave office gracefully.This has won him both praise as a statesman and howls of \"traitor\" from members of his party as it divides itself in a tug-of-war for its declining power base. </p> <p>\"The PRI leaves behind corruption, violence, poverty, backwardness, but on the other hand the economy is doing well and we have economic and political stability,\" Mr Fox said. </p> <p>He admitted that there would be resistance to the political clean-up and progressive modernisation he had promised, mainly from organised crime, the drug cartels and the most corrupt elements in the PRI, who see their interests affected, but he insisted that he would \"do battle\" against them. </p> <p>There are creeping signs that the honeymoon is already losing its shine. </p> <p>The revelation that senior advisers are already being paid salaries equivalent to government ministers lies uneasily with Mr Fox's promises of an upright political morality. </p> <p>There are also rumours that the transition team is riddled with backbiting and that there is a delicate relationship between the press and Mr Fox's spokeswoman, Martha Sahagun, in part sparked by speculation that they are about to get married. </p> <p>\"Now he is beginning to have to face the real Mexico, and the real Mexico is full of contradictions, even within his own supporters,\" the political analyst Alfonso Zarate said.</p>"
