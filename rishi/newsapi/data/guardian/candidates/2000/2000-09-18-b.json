  "Nelson Mandela is to provide Labour with an important pre-election boost when he takes centre stage at the party's annual conference in Brighton next week. <p>The former South African president, who is admired throughout the Labour movement for his lifelong struggle against apartheid, will give his personal seal of approval to Tony Blair on the final day of the conference. </p> <p>Mr Mandela will be followed on stage by the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, who will try to galvanise party supporters with a barnstorming speech at Labour's last conference before the general election. </p> <p>The appearance of one of the world's most respected elder statesmen in Brighton will come as a welcome relief to Mr Blair as he struggles to regain his popularity after the collapse of Labour's opinion poll lead. </p> <p>The Conservatives are likely to attack Labour for using such a respected figure in such a partisan way. </p> <p>Mr Blair was strongly criticised when he claimed, in his speech to last year's Labour conference, that Mr Mandela had been imprisoned by the \"forces of conservatism\". </p> <p>Mr Blair first met Mr Mandela when the statesman visited Britain in 1996. </p> <p>\"Nelson Mandela's welcome in the House of Commons was truly unforgettable. It made me want to cry,\" Mr Blair, who was leader of the opposition, said. </p> <p>\"The image it left with me was this one - Speaker Betty Boothroyd leading Mandela down the steps, a rather unlikely pair holding hands in a place and at a time of great solemnity.\" </p> <p>Labour has strong links with the African National Congress. The former ANC leader Cyril Ramaphosa was appointed this year to act as one of two independent inspectors of IRA weapons dumps.</p>",
  "It is time to feel sorry for GW Bush. He has tons of charm, but he is up against Harrison Ford, Julia Roberts, Michael Douglas, Matt Damon, Jimmy Buffett, Paul Simon and Bette Midler - and Jesus Christ superstar as played by the Democrats' vice-presidential candidate Joe Lieberman, the senator with a halo. GW has only Charlton Heston, in the very old chariot provided by the National Rifle Association. GW's running mate is the tubby, follically challenged Dick Cheney who is out in the sticks giving a very good impersonation of Beelzebub, all pitchfork and no polish. <p>Gore is ahead for the first time, even allowing for the three-to-four-point margin of error. The radiance shed by the stars - and Gore's wife Tipper - must have something to do with how the public sees Al Gore these days. I can't prove that statistically, but it can't do any harm that Indiana Jones implies you're a good guy to go tiger shooting with and Julia Roberts finds your bashfulness sexy. </p> <p>Gore himself hasn't changed much. He has come out of country brown suits with an open collar and into city suits, white shirt with tie, but he is still the solid, decent, worthy candidate who was behind Bush in the August popularity stakes. Clear majorities of Americans saw Bush as being more likable, more honest and ethical, more likely to say what he believed rather than what people wanted to hear. Bush was even slightly ahead as \"caring for people like you\". Now Gore has reversed the ratings, a trend that began with the post-convention bounce but has continued. Although the Republicans have spent a fortune on television commercials painting the vice-president as a dissembler, who will say anything for a vote, Gore is ahead by five points in the honesty rankings. </p> <p> Feel sorry also for GW because, while lending their charisma, Hollywood has enabled the Gore campaign to coin millions. The single star-studded event at the Radio City Hall in New York the other night, organised by Miramax's Harvey Weinstein, Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone and impresario John Sykes, yielded an extraordinary $6m for the Democrats. It is enough to make a good Republican puke when at the same time Al and \"Holy Joe\" have been denouncing Hollywood and the music industry for producing too much sex and violence. They have even advertised their approval for a measure of government control which has produced the topsy-turvy situation of the Republicans reaching for their First-Amendment pistols. </p> <p>And feel sorry for GW because his own party has done its bit to undo his lead. The vocabulary of American political discourse is coarser than the British. It did not really do GW and Cheney much harm when a microphone picked up their description of a New York Times reporter as \"a major league asshole\". But there was instant recoil from the Republican television commercial where they flashed the word RATS in big luminescent capitals at the end of an attack on Gore's penchant for bureaucRATS. </p> <p>It was not so much the epithet that reverberated. If the Republicans had smiled when they said it, they might have got away with this, but they pretended that those seeing the word RATS must have been mistaken: I saw it and jumped in synchrony with millions of less-than-fully-alert viewers from Gotham to Sunset Boulevard. The Republicans were treating the public as simpletons just as they did when they repudiated the time-honoured formula for three national debates (all channels) and proposed one debate and two chat shows, which would have meant their man being exposed to millions fewer. The attempt then to portray Al Gore, who rejected the subterfuge, as the one who was funking national debates was farcical. It didn't play in Peoria or anywhere else, so the Republicans have retreated. There will be the usual three debates. How could they have so underrated the intelligence of the voters? Are they so devilishly cunning that the fumbling is all part of a plot to lower expectations for GW's performance so that he will look better on the night? </p> <p>There has been tumult inside the Republican hierarchy over all this, a split between the boys in Austin, Texas, who have been managing things, sort of, and leaders of the Republican national committee in Washington who fear that GW is having done to him what his dad did to Michael Dukakis in 1988: Dukakis, too, was the front-runner until midsummer, then lost his momentum. </p> <p>Now GW has called in Ed Gillespie as an emergency adviser to redirect his \"message campaign\" and the early word is that he will no longer count on charisma, but attack on the issues. Gore is the supreme policy wonk whose idea of a good time is going to bed with a dossier from the Office of Management and Budget. The order to seize his guns is reminiscent of the order to the Light Brigade at Balaclava. It is magnificent, but is it war? </p> <p><a href=\"mailton:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "After years of authoritarian leadership, President Alberto Fujimori of Peru has capitulated to pressure at home and abroad with the announcement that he will stand down and call new elections. <p>Mr Fujimori, South America's longest-serving leader, delivered the bombshell during a televised speech to the nation on Saturday night. </p> <p>The news took everyone by surprise, coming only four months after a hard-fought presidential election in which he used dictatorial methods to keep his grip on power. </p> <p>\"Despite having been elected by a majority of the population, I do not want to become a disturbing factor, and much less, an obstacle to the strengthening of the democratic system,\" Mr Fujimori said. </p> <p>Immediately after the announcement, thousands of jubilant Peruvians celebrated outside the presidential palace in Lima. In other cities drivers waved flags and honked their car horns late into the night. </p> <p>Mr Fujimori, 62, indicated that his decision was linked to a deepening bribery scandal sparked by video footage of his head of intelligence handing over cash to a rival politician. </p> <p>\"After deep reflection, I have decided, first, to deactivate the national intelligence system and, second, to call general elections as soon as possible. In these general elections, it goes without saying, I will not participate. I am sure the people will be able, with prudence, to choose the best destiny.\" </p> <p>Despite the corruption scandal, the announcement by Mr Fujimori astonished Peruvians and foreign observers alike. After 10 years in office, he was a regional paradigm of an authoritarian but effective populist who governs in tandem with the security forces. </p> <p>Opposition Congressman Carlos Ferrero said Mr Fujimori was forced to step down because the armed forces, especially the army, had withdrawn support.\"If Fujimori had continued to have the support of the armed forces, he never would have said what he said tonight,\" Mr Ferrero said. </p> <p>Mr Fujimori was elected to an unprecedented third five-year term in voting that ended with a second round in May. His opponent in the runoff, Alejandro Toledo, dropped out because of allegations of vote-fixing. </p> <p>Mr Fujimori's victory brought strong criticism from the US and other countries, and isolated Peru from its South American neighbours. </p> <p>He had appeared to have survived the storm until the video was released on Thursday, apparently showing Vladimiro Montesinos, his closest advisor, offering cash to opposition Congressman Alberto Kouri for his support of the government. </p> <p>Hours before Mr Fujimori's announcement, the Organisation of American States issued a demand that he suspend Mr Montesinos and other officials linked to the scandal. In recent months, Mr Montesinos has been accused of illicit enrichment and of engineering smear campaigns against Mr Fujimori's opponents in this year's presidential elections. </p> <p>During his rule, Mr Fujimori has successfully combated a bloody leftist insurgency and tamed hyperinflation. </p> <p>\"I have governed Peru for the last 10 years. Not even my detractors would fail to recognise fundamental achievements which I will not enumerate. You know what they are. </p> <p><br><b>A decade of Fujimori:</b> <br><br><b> 1990</b> Wins presidential election. A political unknown until weeks before the vote, Fujimori surprisingly defeats author Mario Vargas Llosa. </p> <p><b> 1992 </b> Dissolves Congress and seizes authoritarian powers. Argues that move is necessary to defeat leftwing rebel group Shining Path. </p> <p><b> 1993 </b> Introduces rewritten constitution. </p> <p><b> 1995 </b> Elected for second presidential term. Congress dominated by his supporters. </p> <p><b> 2000 April</b> Receives 49.9% of vote in first round of presidential election, forcing a run-off against opposition candidate Alejandro Toledo. </p> <p><b> May</b> Toledo withdraws from race, alleging corruption, handing Fujimori his third term in office. </p> <p><b> July</b> Huge demonstrations in Lima against Fujimori s inauguration. </p> <p><b> September </b> Video of Fujimori s top advisor allegedly bribing an opposition congressman scandalises Peru. Fujimori says he will call new elections and will not be a candidate.</p>"
