  "SDLP leader John Hume yesterday took his first step towards retirement from politics after 30 years in the front line when he announced that he would shortly quit the Northern Ireland assembly. <p>Mr Hume, 63, said he would be resigning his seat at Stormont to concentrate on his work as Foyle MP at Westminster and as one of Northern Ireland's three MEPs. Colleagues insisted yesterday there was no question of him relinquishing his leadership of the party. </p> <p>But Mr Hume, who won the Nobel peace prize with Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble two years ago, has been dogged by poor health for several years.

His condition was much more serious than initially conceded, requiring four operations, and his subsequent fitness regime includes long walks in the Stormont grounds. Mr Hume, who adores the international political stage, had carefully avoided becoming too tied into the assembly, allowing his number two, Seamus Mallon, to play deputy first minister to Mr Trimble in the power-sharing executive. He had declined to take a place on any committee, indicating he would leave when the assembly bedded in. </p> <p>Although the Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, could order a byelection under the assembly rules, it is more likely an SDLP member will be co-opted. Mr Hume's nominated replacement is Annie Coulter, a member of Derry city council. </p> <p>Mr Hume said last night: \"I have become heavily over loaded with work, and I have had serious health problems over the past year.

He will be sorely missed on the assembly benches.\" Mr Hume told party colleagues at Stormont on Tuesday, but gave them no indication of exactly when he would leave the assembly. </p> <p>Mr Hume was under most intense pressure when news of his developing relationship with the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, leaked at one of the most bloody periods of the troubles. His clandestine talks with Mr Adams led to the IRA ceasefire in August 1994.

  "When August began, the American election looked as though it would be about Clinton's trousers. But the month changed everything. Watching it unfold, I saw most parts of Bill Clinton, his inimitable charisma as well as his porous apparel, receding daily from the public mind. The election will be about the future not the past. It's the most important election in the world. It may also turn out to be the best election in the world, restoring stark left-right argument to the politics of a western democracy for the first time since the 80s. <p>At the start, it seemed possible that the voters were getting ready to withdraw from Al Gore, the Democratic candidate for president, the forgiveness they'd offered Clinton for the Monica calamity. During that humiliation, the public withheld the loathing which many politicians and commentators, including this one, thought would empty Clinton's remaining two years of all authority. We were wrong. But George W Bush promised Americans he would restore \"dignity and respect\" to the White House. It was the insistent coded mantra he offered the Republican convention. For two weeks, with Gore 12 points behind in the polls, it seemed to be working. </p> <p>This would have been perverse. Was Gore to be trapped between Clinton's incorrigible frailties, on which the people took delayed revenge, and his populistic brilliance, of which the vice president, a leaden speaker and earnest policy-wonk, is in regrettably short supply? The laid-back Bush, reformed alcoholic with distant rumours of cocaine lying unrebutted on the table, had the family connections, the new-leaf repentance, the pleasing manner and the apparent experience stemming from one of the weakest governorships in the US, to take advantage of the personality contest the election might easily become. </p> <p>But already it is different. The personalities will continue to matter, and the body-language is finely watched. Gore hired a ballet dancer to coach him in platform movement. Significant polling gains are attributed to the most lubricious kiss any politician ever gave his wife, uncoached, on a public platform. It's also true that both candidates know their battle is for the centre, both the political and, as it happens, the geographical, the eastern-central and middle-western states. The most startling development as August waned, though, was the clarifying of their differences. </p> <p>The man responsible for this is Al Gore. He needed to change the subject, away from Clinton's aura and Bush's contentless agenda, and did so by the un-American activity of turning sharply to the left. I don't want to exaggerate this. Gore is still locked into funding from corporate America, still mute on inequality, and well outflanked by Ralph Nader running as an independent candidate. But Bush is much more uncomfortable with a turn of events that is forcing him to be specific. \"Dignity and respect\" have almost ceased to matter, as the details of his \"compassionate conservatism\" begin to be ranged against a Gore programme that shows more confidence than Clinton's ever did in the traditional Democrat constituency. </p> <p> Central to Bush's programme is a massive tax cut of $1.3 trillion, geared without discrimination in favour of the rich. Gore promises less than half that, mainly with subsidies to middle-class (working-class is outside the US political vocabulary) families. A projected budget surplus of $4.6 trillion over 10 years would be used by Gore mainly to cut the debt, by Bush mainly to cut taxes and start privatising social security. But Gore would spend $400bn on health care - insurance for the low-paid, and free drugs for the elderly - Bush a quarter of that. Gore favours a huge federal spend on education: $115bn over the decade, a 50% rise in an area traditionally left to states and localities. Bush, while making education his social priority, wants to rearrange school structures rather than spend anything like that kind of money. </p> <p>Whoever wins, Congress will have the final say in all this. But other differences speak as clearly for a philosophical divide. Bush and Gore would engage with the public and the Senate from starting points quite distant from each other. The most blatant contrast is over environmental protection, where Gore's commitment is as lengthy and knowledgeable as Bush's is Texas-brutish towards any measure making life harder for business, and damn the consequences for global warming. Myriad crucial choices display the same cleavage of attitude. Three seem especially noteworthy. Over gun control, national missile defence and abortion rights, the American voter has to choose between leaders who are absolutists on none of them, but whose preferred biases are heavily divergent. </p> <p>Gore's predicament, in other words, has turned this into an issue-based campaign. He had to do it this way. It conformed to his own wonkish nature, and played to his strengths as a serious politician who has built national experience over 30 years. More pressingly, it was the only escape-route from the trivialities that suited Bush better. It has forced Bush into the open, requiring the sort of performance in which he has so far failed to shine. </p> <p>How, exactly, the issues turn out to be argued is another matter. There's more money available for this year's campaign than for any in recorded history, and most of it will be spent on 30-second TV and radio commercials. That's the idiom that will blanket the airwaves with increasing frenzy for the next two months. America is not a predominantly political country. There is no conversation that could be called national. Many people will have little background against which to measure the roaring assaults. Reduced to three sentences, the case for a trillion dollar tax cut may be all too easily misunderstood. We're not talking Socratic dialogue here. Personal viciousness will also be heating up. It's perfectly suited to the insidious soundbite. The pretence that the other guy is sincere, a ritual bow this August to focus-group disgust at \"divisiveness\", will soon explode. </p> <p>But those are commonplace developments: louder and richer than ever, but the usual currency of American politics. What is not usual is a disagreement that can be called ideological. That has not been so common, to put it mildly, in American as in European postwar politics. In this contest it is more explicit than in the last German, French or British elections - though William Hague is doing his best to ensure that next year's choice will be clear enough. What Gore, with the aid of Bush, is doing is to challenge some of the assumptions which persuaded Clinton that the only way he could win and govern was by leading his party from the right. This is making for an epic contest, to be decided as usual by money and organisation, but introducing the US in a new role that puts Europe to shame: leader of a political argument that really matters. </p> <p> hugo.young@compuserve.com</p>",
  "A security scare overshadowed President Clinton's arrival in the Colombian port of Cartagena yesterday when police discovered sticks of dynamite in a flat near a building the president was due to visit. <p>Two men, suspected of being members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), the country's largest guerrilla force, were arrested and anti-American leaflets seized. Colombian police said the explosives, weighing about 4.4lb, had not been made up into a bomb. </p> <p>In a separate incident, security staff sealed off an area of the city after finding a suspicious device, which later turned out to be a bag of rubbish. </p> <p>The visit was intended as a show of support for Colombian president Andres Pastrana's efforts to defeat the drugs trade and bring peace to the country after nearly 40 years of civil war violence. </p> <p>A wave of guerrilla attacks and street protests were launched to coincide with the visit. Leftist rebels detonated a car bomb and launched attacks on police stations, army posts and banks, but most of the violence was hundreds of miles away from Cartagena, where the two presidents met to discuss anti-narcotics policy. </p> <p>Around 200 Farc guerrillas launched a daylight raid on the town of Miranda in the southern state of Cauca. In a separate attack, five civilians were killed when Farc rebels rained homemade bombs on the town of Lavateca near the border with Venezuela. </p> <p>The centre of Bogota was paralysed as around 2,000 students, union members and indigenous activists marched on the US embassy. Masked students skirmished with riot police and set a bus on fire. </p> <p>The city was seen as too dangerous a location for talks with Colombian officials, and Mr Clinton was guarded by 5,000 Colombian troops, 350 US agents, helicopter gunships and a naval patrol boat during his visit. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cicad.oas.org/\" target=\"_new\">Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/www/background_notes/colombia_197_bgn.html\" target=\"_new\">US state department: Colombia</a><br></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.presidencia.gov.co/\" target=\"_new\">Government of Colombia</a></p>",

  "A senior official of Slobodan Milosevic's Socialist party threw down the gauntlet to the international community with a surprise visit to Kosovo yesterday, where she declared that Belgrade would set up polling stations in the Serb province for next month's Yugoslav elections. <p>Gorica Gajevic, general secretary of the party, told a crowd of pro-Milosevic Serbs that 500 polling stations would be set up in the Serb enclaves for polling in the federal and presidential elections on September 24. </p> <p>She also pledged that 200 flats would be built in Kosovo for returning Serb refugees. </p> <p>Bernard Kouchner, the head of Kosovo's UN administration, immediately dismissed the polling promise. \"If they want to have elections in Serb enclaves, that's impossible,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Kouchner plans to hold separate local elections within the province a month after Yugoslavia votes in the local, parliamentary and presidential poll. </p> <p>Ms Gajevic's move effectively calls the international community's bluff, for UN resolution 1244 and the technical-military agreement signed in Kumanovo before the pullout of Serb troops in June last year state that Kosovo remains a part of Yugoslavia. </p> <p>However, the return of some Serb forces to the region, as envisaged in the Kumanovo agreement, has not yet happened </p> <p>Many Serbs unofficially admit that Kosovo is lost to Serbia. Even the opposition presidential candidate Vojislav Kostunica says that it should stay under UN administration for the time being. </p> <p>Ms Gajevic's visit signals Belgrade's intent to make Kosovo an election issue and exploit the ambiguity over its status for propaganda. </p> <p>Tomorrow the Yugoslav army will hold exercises of a new Kosovo unit currently based in southern Serbia. </p> <p>A Belgrade analyst, Bratislav Grubacic, said the state media would probably cover the manoeuvres and announce that the unit was returning to Kosovo. A poll of Serbs in Kosovo could be a fertile area for voting fraud, he said. </p> <p>An opposition party leader, Professor Zarko Korac, president of the Social Democratic Union, said: \"It's another sign of the confusion in Kosovo. The whole point is: who will organise elections?\" </p> <p>He said that opposition politicians had unsuccesfully pressed European governments to support elections in Kosovo at the same time as those in the rest of Yugoslavia. Now Mr Milosevic's party had taken up the theme and would organise the poll.</p>",
  "Al Gore and George W Bush have become locked in an increasingly acrimonious debate about debates, with the two White House contenders jockeying for advantage over the format of their televised confrontations this autumn. <p>In an attempt to break with the traditional televised set-up, the Republican candidate, Mr Bush, is pressing for the debates to have a more informal, round-table character, moderated by hosts who he hopes will adopt a softer, more conversational approach. </p> <p>The Bush camp would like at least one, and possibly more, of the debates to be modelled on a session which took place during the Republican primary race earlier this year, in which the rival contenders were interviewed around a table by CNN's Larry King. Mr Bush said this week that such debates were \"more free flowing\". </p> <p>But the Democrat nominee, Mr Gore, has already accepted a plan put forward by a neutral commission for three debates in October along traditional lines, with the two men standing at lecterns and being grilled by senior political reporters. </p> <p>Mr Gore has also said repeatedly that he will debate with his rival \"any time, anywhere, any place\", though whether he would actually do so is likely to depend on Mr Bush's willingness to agree to the prime-time network events as well. </p> <p>Such debates about debates are not new in American presidential elections, but the Gore-Bush argument has come earlier than usual and reflects the immense stakes which both camps have in the outcome of this year's televised head-to-head sessions. </p> <p>With most of the opinion polls now showing the White House race to be a close one, both men see the debates as one of the few major opportunities to shift voters' minds in the run-up to the November 7 election. </p> <p>As a result, the Gore and Bush camps are both desperate to ensure that their opponent does not get an inbuilt advantage from the way the debates are structured and conducted. Mr Gore's camp believes that its man will outshine Mr Bush in high-profile debates, while Mr Bush's handling of the argument suggests that he fears Mr Gore could be right. </p> <p>At this stage of the campaign the two men only agree on two things - that there will be presidential debates of some description this autumn, and that only Mr Bush and Mr Gore will take part in them. </p> <p>The two main candidates both oppose any efforts by the Reform party's Pat Buchanan or the Green party nominee, Ralph Nader, to be included in the debates. </p> <p>Earlier this year, the independent Commission on Presidential Debates, a bipartisan group which has sponsored nationally televised presidential debates in each of the last three American elections, put forward proposals for three debates between the presidential nominees and one debate between the vice-presidential candidates. </p> <p>They would take place between October 3 and 17 and all four would be broadcast by the three major US networks - ABC, CBS and NBC. </p> <p>Mr Gore accepted the commission's proposals this week and also agreed to a suggestion from the Bush camp for a second televised match-up between Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman, the vice- presidential nominees. </p> <p>Mr Bush's reluctance to make the same commitment prompted a barrage of attacks from the Gore camp. \"George Bush is trying to do everything he can to avoid prime-time presidential debates that will be seen on all three networks,\" a spokesman Mark Fabiani said. </p> <p>Such attacks riled Mr Bush. \"Who said we don't want prime-time exposure?\" he retorted at a meeting with reporters on his campaign plane. Mr Bush said he would \"pick and choose\" the venues, formats and ground rules for the debates.</p>",
  "President Bill Clinton flew into Colombia yesterday amid a countrywide outbreak of rebel violence and protests against a massive boost in US military aid to the government. <p>Leftwing guerrillas attacked police stations and army posts, bombs exploded outside banks and masked students clashed with riot police. </p> <p>The violence took place mostly around the three main cities and in rural areas hundreds of miles from Cartagena, the Caribbean tourist resort where 5,000 troops, 350 US agents, helicopter gunships and an American aircraft carrier provided security for Mr Clinton's nine-hour visit. </p> <p>On Tuesday night, rebels attacked 12 police stations in six of the country's 32 departments. Five civilians, including two children, died when guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) rained mortar bombs on a police station in the village of La Bateca, near the border with Venezuela. </p> <p>In south-west Cali, the second largest city, Farc guerrillas detonated bombs outside three banks, causing widespread damage but no injuries, police said. </p> <p>In the north-eastern oil- producing province of Arauca, another Farc unit attacked an army barracks near the town of Fortul on Tuesday afternoon, injuring six soldiers, an army spokeswoman said. Guerrillas also attacked an army post in the nearby town of Saravena. US-made Blackhawk helicopters flew to the region to strike back at the rebel column. </p> <p>Rebel commanders have denounced the US aid package, which includes 60 helicopters, equipment and training for the Colombian army, saying that money will cause an escalation in the civil war, and eventually US-backed military action against the guerrillas. </p> <p>\"Clinton isn't here to support social investment but a military plan. We don't want to make threats, but the Colombian people have the rights to take to the streets and protest against this visit,\" the Farc commander, Andres Paris, told the Guardian. </p> <p>In a videotaped address to the Colombian people broadcast on Tuesday night, Mr Clinton stressed the social development programmes included in the aid package, and denied that Washington planned military intervention. </p> <p>\"We have no military objective. We do not believe your conflict has a military solution. We support the peace process. Our approach is both pro-peace and anti-drug,\" Mr Clinton said. </p> <p>Yesterday the Miami Herald reported that the Pentagon is planning to send an army general to oversee the military element of the aid package. </p> <p>According to US law, a maximum of 500 American troops and 300 civilian contractors may be in Colombia at any time, but the president may waive the limit in the event of an \"imminent involvement\" of US forces in hostilities. </p> <p>The largest chunk of American money will pay for 60 helicopters to support a military offensive in the rebel-dominated jungles of southern Colombia, where most of the world's cocaine is produced. The helicopters and three US-trained anti-narcotics army battalions will lead the advance, securing control of drug plantations to allow the police to eradicate illegal crops. </p> <p>Mr Clinton waived strict human rights conditions to approve the aid last week, despite fears that the Colombian military maintains close ties with illegal rightwing paramilitary groups. </p> <p>In its 1999 report, the state department reported \"credible allegations of co-operation with paramiltary groups, including both silent support and direct collaboration.\" </p> <p>Monitoring groups in Colombia fear that the American money will exacerbate the country's 35-year civil war and cause up to 200,000 people to flee their homes. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cicad.oas.org/\" target=\"_new\">Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/www/background_notes/colombia_197_bgn.html\" target=\"_new\">US state department: Colombia</a><br></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.presidencia.gov.co/\" target=\"_new\">Government of Colombia</a></p>"
