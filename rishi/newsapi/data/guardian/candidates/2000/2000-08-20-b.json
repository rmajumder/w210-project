  "Al Gore, now installed as Democratic candidate for the US presidency, has more to worry about than just George W Bush. There is also a potential threat from a third-party candidate. Not from the Reform party, founded by Ross Perot but now hopelessly split, with two rival factions claiming its candidacy, but from Ralph Nader, the veteran consumer crusader, running now on a green ticket. <p>Some analysts warn that Nader could do serious damage to Gore, especially by bleeding off votes he needs to take California. </p> <p> Nader could have that kind of effect without coming anywhere near the success of Perot, who in 1992 took 19% of the popular vote - the largest share for any third-party candidate in the 20th century. Yet Perot failed even then to break the two-party mould, as he had hoped.</p> <p> The last third force to do that was the Republican party. In the exceptional crisis of the 1850s over slavery, the existing parties collapsed, allowing Abraham Lincoln to take the presidency in 1860 with only 39% of the popular vote and no support at all in 10 of the 33 states which then existed. </p> <p>After that, the system evolved precisely to make it hard for such disintegration to happen again. In the 20th century no third party - populist, progressive, socialist or communist - succeeded in mounting a serious challenge to the major parties. </p> <p>Nader - articulate, experienced and above all honest - hopes to equal or even surpass Perot's performance eight years ago. But to have that kind of popular effect he would need to win a majority of the popular vote in a populous state, such as California, Texas or New York, or even a middle-size state, such as Illinois or Ohio. He would also have to do it in a close-fought election. </p> <p>The American constitution stipulates that when the polls close on November 7, 540 members of an electoral college must meet to choose the president. This is usually a formality. But, as in any first-past-the-post election, if more than two candidates are contending, it is possible that no one will win more than half the vote. Only by custom and practice, not by law, do college members follow the popular vote in their states, since the whole idea of the electoral college was to modify the tyranny of majorities. </p> <p>Were Bush and Gore to win states with a roughly equal number of college votes, third-party intervention could be decisive. If a third-party candidate were to win states which gave him or her 40 votes in the electoral college, with Bush and Gore winning 250 each, the college could not elect a new president. </p> <p>In such a case, the House of Representatives would decide, with each Congress-person free to choose between the top two candidates in the college - in this case, Bush and Gore. That has only happened once - in 1824, when there were five major candidates - although the 1876 presidential election was finally decided only by a special federal commission. </p> <p>Fringe third parties always run candidates for president, but only two have made any national impact. In 1948, Governor Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, running as an insurgent Democrat against Harry Truman, carried his own state plus Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi. Though Truman narrowly won that election, Thurmond's intervention revealed the strength of white southern resistance to affirmative action on civil rights and helped slow the pace of racial integration during the 1950s. </p> <p>Mindful of Thurmond's example, in 1968 Governor George Wallace of Alabama ran as an insurgent southern Democrat. He won the same states as Thurmond 20 years earlier and took 13% of the popular vote nationally. Wallace's support in southern cities was impressive, including more than a third of the vote in towns in Arkansas, Florida, North Carolina and Tennessee. Nixon just scraped into the White House, however. In 1972, Wallace did well in Democratic primaries in Maryland, Florida and Michigan, this last state revealing working-class support in the industrial north. He looked poised to surpass his 1968 performance until a madman shot him and ended his political career. </p> <p>Wallace was a dangerous racist demagogue who articulated the hopes, fears and grievances of millions of white Americans, the working poor in every community and state who felt excluded from conventional politics. These \"forgotten Americans\", lacking secure employment, health care and opportunity, resent the fact that they do not share in the abundance of American life and hate paying taxes for welfare they do not receive. Wallace paved the way for those \"Democrats for Reagan\" who, in the 1980s, finally brought to an end the Democratic coalition that had elected Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. </p> <p>What chance does Nader have in November of breaking the present political mould? Though history is a poor guide to political prediction, it would be very surprising if Nader made much impact. He is not speaking for \"forgotten Americans\" but for a minority of middle-class voters fed up with meaningless domestic politics. </p> <p>Perot's share of the vote in 1992 failed to carry a single state, and, by taking more votes from the older George Bush than from his then largely unknown opponent Bill Clinton, Perot helped Clinton's clever and eventually victorious campaign. Eight years later much depends on whether Nader can get himself on the ballot in every state. Even so, American protest voters look more likely to reveal themselves by failing to vote than by casting a protest vote for a third-party activist like Nader. </p> <p>\u0095 Patrick Renshaw is reader in American history at Sheffield University </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\"> comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Who are the latest heroes of American television - successors to the battling cops of NYPD, the electrifying doctors of ER, the crusading lawyers of The Practice? When young people, deprived of potential military glory through long years of peace, testify to their higher idealism in public, what do they say? Well Hello, Mr Chips. </p> <p>America's teachers suddenly stand, at least in political legend, on the edge of the canyon called Hope. Teaching is suddenly the most wanted, most admired profession. The new television series - \"from the makers of Ally McBeal\" - is called Boston Public. It will be front-line stuff: gallant staff, big city problems, challenge, failure and heart-warming triumph mingled. The myths are in the making. </p> <p>And the politicians who help make those myths cluster, unusually enough, in the van of eulogy and change. Consider Al Gore. \"At a time when the amount of human knowledge is doubling every five years, we will do bold things to make our schools the best in the world. I will fight for the single greatest commitment to education since the GI bill ... It's time to treat and reward teachers like the professionals they are.\" </p> <p>Consider George W Bush. \"Education reform is empty if it does not take into account the needs of the educators. Teachers are not the object of education reform, they are the engine of education reform. They have a high calling, and we must respect it. As we ask more of teachers, we must do more to help them.\" </p> <p>Bush, moreover, doesn't just hymn \"excellent teachers\" - he covered the convention stage in Philadelphia with them, along with a mock classroom with real pupils where they could display their arts. Show as well as tell. Both he and Gore have decided that the big issue for November's election is education times three. Gore's dad was a teacher. Bush's wife was a teacher. Teachers are wonderful people. </p> <p>Pause and pinch yourself, for the schooling reality here is wholly familiar to any visiting Brit. Public schools - the ones we call state schools - are often fine in leafy suburbs, but much too often lousy in the urban ghettos and ethnic melting pots. Between 40% and 50% of poor kids can emerge from the public system as functional illiterates; 43% of maths teachers in high-poverty areas have no relevant qualifications. Sink schools that David Blunkett would consign to history in Deptford just potter along in Detroit. Eight years of Clinton prosperity have not closed that learning gap. In many ways, as the suburbs have grown leafier, it has opened wider. </p> <p>What's fascinating, though, isn't the similarity of the dilemma, but the difference in the rhetoric. When Bush denounces \"the soft bigotry of expectations, with too many children segregated into schools without standards, shuffled from grade to grade because of their age and regardless of their knowledge\", he doesn't blame the teachers. His targets, of course, are the local and federal bureaucrats who choke the system with their dogma and ineptitude. And though Gore talks warmly about \"more money, higher standards and accountability\", his litany of blame, too, passes the denizens of the classrooms by. </p> <p>The language they both use is curiously military. Gore \"fights away\" in the tradition of the GI bill. The Republican party manifesto platform pledges itself to \"improve teacher training and recruiting by expanding the troops-to-teachers programme, which places retired military personnel in the classroom\". This is a war, to be fought by war-like means in a war-like way. </p> <p> Let's put the respective generals' battle plans to one side. They aren't, in their myriad detail, too helpful. Gore sees pre-school education and better access to college places as the answer: Bush wants to dismantle local education authorities, give school heads supreme power and experiment with vouchers. Britain has mostly been here before - and will probably be here again. The real lesson from America is rather simpler than that. </p> <p>Both candidates talk standards and targets. Both men would tighten monitoring of what goes on behind the school gates. But both lead with more cash in teachers' wage packets as a symbol of their zeal: the front-end sweetener that Bush used in Texas. Both want the teachers on their side, and both know that recruiting and retaining good teachers is the key to success. </p> <p>I don't suppose that Mr Blunkett or Mr Blair - in some ways deeper into this forest - would dissent one jot over substance. On the contrary, they'd dust off their collected speeches and cite countless tributes to the vital role that teachers perform, as well (like George W) as lauding the wonders of merit pay. Yet emotionally the message sounds quite different. </p> <p>The voice of reform, for Blair as for Major before him, belongs to Chris Woodhead - and, inevitably, it is critical, censorious. Woodhead's team inspect schools, inspect teachers. They do an important job and, of course, they mix praise with blame; but they are not the cheerleaders of better times. They are bound to say \"Yes - but\". </p> <p>There are all manner of reasons that schoolteachers, in Britain as in America, don't enjoy the respect, the professional status, that the politicians allegedly seek for them - or the pay which, in either country, still mostly squats in the low \u00a320,000s. One reason, undoubtedly, is an attachment to a version of trade unionism too suspicious of change and too Gradgrind in its responses. Professionalism doesn't come that way. </p> <p>The United States has some school problems we rarely dream of. Not just gun massacres like Columbine, but crime against teachers - more than 1m thefts and 600,000 violent crimes in a five-year period. Its mountains to climb are far more precipitous. But the mood - however frail it ultimately proves - is determined and optimistic. And it begins by getting teachers on side. </p> <p>It woos them with more than cash and promises. It tells them they are lonely, beleaguered members of their community who have, and deserve, political respect. It sets them at the centre of our future - better than lawyers, doctors, cops: the new TV superheroes. Bush shrewdly made such faith seem tangible in Philadelphia as he let two young public headmasters (one from Texas, one from the Bronx) talk onstage about their own special schools - which teach inner city kids 10 hours a day (plus two hours' homework) and demand an intensity of commitment from staff and pupils alike. Stunning effort; stunning results; mesmeric professionals in action. </p> <p>America, typically, thinks that to be good, teachers have to feel good first - that morale can be bestowed and self-esteem constructed. Crude marketing in a phoney \"war\"? Perhaps. But watch, the force of expectation is with it. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Whenever we dwindling aficionados of the music hall get together, we play the \"bill matter game\". Who was the \"Cheekie Chappie\"? Who was \"The Thief of Bad Gags\"? <p>Bill matter was the name for the descriptive copyline under the name of each \"turn\" on the playbills that adorned the boards advertising the week's attractions. Max Miller was billed as the Cheekie Chappie and American comic Milton Berle was the Thief. Other memorable bill matter included: \"The Prime Minister of Mirth\" (Dan Leno) and \"Fiddling and Fooling\" (Ted Ray). One of my favourites, perhaps not politically correct these days, was a speciality act (jugglers, acrobats and the like) called the Aberdonians. Their bill matter was \"Too Mean To Tell You What They Do\". </p> <p>Idly watching a rather dull soccer match recently, I started musing about bill matter for footballers. Norman Hunter, once of Leeds and England, got close with his \"Bites Yer Legs\" tag. But of today's stars, how about \"Gallic charmer\" for David Ginola, or \"Who's A Naughty Boy\" under Paul Gascoigne's name? Darren Anderton would undoubtedly be billed as \"Direct from the NHS\" (or should that read Harley Street?) </p> <p>Silly, really. But this whimsy set me further thinking about the converging business cultures of showbiz and today's soccer. Music hall turns were all freelances, picking up bookings from week to week wherever the theatre owners had a vacancy. The variety agents made their living booking these turns round the halls, week by week. The call would emerge from Moss Empires theatres that they were a ventriloquist short for Easter week at the Holborn Empire, and the agents would hit the phones. </p> <p>Since the Bosman ruling gave footballers the right to free transfers on expiry of their contract, the average stay of any player at any club has shrunk dramatically, with a few honourable exceptions like Tony Adams's 20 years at Arsenal. Benito Carbone, soccer's answer to the Scarlet Pimpernel (they seek him here, they seek him there) has had half a dozen different clubs in fewer years - and he is not alone. The free movement of players, particularly the star attractions who can sell tickets, begins more and more to resemble the itinerant world of the music hall. </p> <p>Now I read with horror and foreboding that the EU is thinking of abolishing transfer fees, hastening the day when players will define long-term loyalty as having played one whole home and one whole away match for their club. </p> <p>In this free-for-all world, most players will have agents, but the journeymen who don't will be reduced to taking advertisements on the internet player exchange (<a href=\"http://www.playersRus.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.playersRus.com)</a> which might read: \"Clogger Bloggins, two good feet, can play midfield or up front, own boots. Unexpectedly available due to a misunderstanding. Call now.\" </p> <p>If the trend continues and, worse, is accelerated by the mooted EU ruling, I can see the day dawning very soon when managers spend their weeks frantically ringing round the booking agents, as Val Parnell used to ring ace variety agents Lew and Leslie Grade in the 50s and 60s, desperately seeking stars and supporting acts for his London Palladium, which changed attractions every week. Soccer is headed the same way. </p> <p>I can hear Alex Ferguson, as soon as one season ends, struggling to fill in his blank team sheets for the whole of the following season and calling round the agents: \"I need a headline striker for the Everton match at Old Trafford on September 10 - is Andy Cole free on that day? What? No it's not on Sky. Oh, he only does TV matches, does he - sorry. Anyone else on your books you can suggest? Alan Shearer? Not sure he isn't over-exposed at Old Trafford, he played for me against Charlton three weeks ago and didn't score.\" </p> <p>Ferguson puts the phone down and finds another booking agent, this time with more success: Michael Owen is recovered from injury and unexpectedly free. \"What does he want for one match against Everton? Er, no it's not televised.\" </p> <p>The agent reels off the contract requirements: </p> <p>*25% of the gross, including the gate money, any radio, TV, internet and ad revenues. </p> <p>*He gets his own dressing room, four car park spaces and 20 tickets for his entourage. </p> <p>*Right to approve all publicity material. </p> <p>*Right to approve his striking partner. </p> <p>*He brings his own masseur, physio and hairdresser at the club's expense. </p> <p>*He can't be substituted during the game other than by mutual consent between the player and the designated manager. </p> <p>*He will not play against Roy Keane. </p> <p>*Right to approve the referee, not to be unreasonably withheld. </p> <p>*Any fines for misconduct incurred paid gross by Manchester United. </p> <p>*If the manager is sacked before the game, Owen has the right to withdraw if he doesn't like Ferguson's replacement. </p> <p>*Oh, and no one gets bigger billing in the programme or in any paid advertising. </p> <p>Ferguson pauses - he knows Everton has already booked Dwight Yorke for this game, which is being billed as a grudge-revenge match. \"OK, it's a deal. Email me the contract,\" says Ferguson, who now has to book a squad to build around Owen for this match. In showbiz, it is called casting. </p> <p>The Old Trafford publicity and marketing team are called in and told eventually of the team Ferguson has put together and the top-of-the- bill attraction. \"Owen?\" they cry, \"He'll take some selling - he emptied Stamford Bridge last year when he went there for Bradford City. Haven't you got any one else, we've got 40,000 season tickets to sell? What about Ginola?\" Ferguson winces and picks up the phone. \"Is that Vidal Sassoon hairdressers? Is David Ginola there? Oh, when he's had his ends done, could he phone me.\" </p> <p>It is worth remembering, as this insanity creeps up on us, that the music halls all ended up as car parks and supermarkets. The audiences found something else that commanded their loyalty.</p>",
  "Al Gore has surged into an opinion poll lead over George W Bush in the American presidential election race following his successful performance at the Democratic convention in Los Angeles last week. <p>Mr Gore leads his Republican rival by 48% to 42% according to a poll of registered voters for Newsweek magazine, with the Green candidate, Ralph Nader, on 3% and Pat Buchanan of the Reform party on 1%. </p> <p>In a second poll released yesterday, this time of likely voters, a new Gallup/CNN survey has Mr Gore leading by one point. Mr Gore is on 47% with Mr Bush on 46%, Mr Nader on 3% and Mr Buchanan on 2%. </p> <p>While such a post-convention poll \"bounce\" is normal, the finding is nevertheless a major relief to the Gore camp, which has trailed behind Mr Bush in all but a handful of polls for most of the past year. </p> <p>\"Obviously we're encouraged by the polls,\" Gore campaign manager William Daley said , \"but the only poll that matters is on November 7.\" </p> <p>In a straight contest with Mr Bush, Mr Gore leads by 52% to 44%. The Democratic candidate's ratings on likeability and honesty have also enjoyed a big boost. </p> <p>Mr Gore spent the weekend campaigning down the Mississippi river, visiting states likely to be crucial in determining the election outcome. Mr Bush visited Tennessee. </p> <p>The locations underlined the way both candidates intend to campaign. Mr Gore and Mr Bush will spend a disproportionate amount of time in the block of swing states from Wisconsin to New Jersey. </p> <p>The camps also have a list of states on which they have not given up, even though they are leaning towards their opponent. For Mr Gore, this category includes Florida, Georgia and North Carolina, while Mr Bush will target Oregon, Arkansas, West Virginia and even California. The decision to campaign in these states is motivated as much by a need to force the other man to spend funds on advertising as by the likelihood of victory. </p> <p>Aides are discussing the number and format of televised debates between the candidates. The federal election commission has proposed three debates in October, with one vice-presidential match-up. The Democrats have accepted Mr Bush's proposal for a second debate between the two running-mates.</p>",
  "They simply can't resist it, can they? Tony Blair and Cherie, walking hand in hand the day after Labour won the general election in 1997; Al Gore and Tipper, snogging on the podium at the Democratic convention in Los Angeles last week. In the latter case, the subtext was so loud it might as well have been broadcast over loudspeakers: I am a happily married family man. I am not, repeat not, Bill Clinton. Thus was another hostage given to fortune, another politician publicly committed to family values - territory already staked out by Gore's choice of Joe Lieberman, a socially conservative Orthodox Jew, as his running mate. But these values are quite at odds with how most people actually conduct their lives. <p>Few of us have perfect marriages. Americans are as prone as the rest of us to serial relationships, although their apparently innate, can-do optimism means they just keep on getting married, sometimes four or five times. But it is not only marriage that fails to conform to the happy families model so beloved of politicians in search of votes - including, although it is scarcely credible with hindsight, William Jefferson Clinton, on the stump with Hillary back in 1992. Many voters are parents of teenage children who stay out late, occasionally drink too much and wake up the neighbours when they finally arrive home. </p> <p>This is normal behaviour, even in a politician's family. It is awkward and embarrassing only if the politician in question is given to delivering homilies about parental responsibility and the evils of drink. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that this unfortunate conjunction, as much as concern over media intrusion, lay behind Downing Street's stern denials at the weekend that the prime minister's eldest son had annoyed other guests at an Italian hotel when he returned in the early hours from a nightclub. Blair's spin machine could easily have shrugged off the whole thing, pointing out that the boy is 16 and on holiday. </p> <p>Instead, reports in the Italian press of rowdy behaviour were categorically denied by Downing Street and the family friends who were entertaining Euan on the island of Ponza. They were contradicted in turn by staff at the hotel where the incident occurred; one of them said that the prime minister's son had been \"horsing around\", and another guest had complained about being woken up at 5am. Result: prime minister with more egg on face, and the story about a troubled teenager in the Blair household, which the couple are desperate to conceal, is starting to shape up nicely. </p> <p>This is unpleasant for Euan, but it is his parents' habitual over-reaction that has created a quite possibly erroneous impression. Blair's recent behaviour suggests that he is quite happy to interfere in our private lives, but does not like it when the press returns the compliment. Downing Street's initial reaction last month, when Euan was found drunk in Leicester Square while his mother was on holiday and his father burned the midnight oil over a speech he was due to deliver next day to an audience of evangelical Christians - a particularly exquisite touch, that - was to bluster and threaten. </p> <p>Downing Street performed a volte face only when advisers realised that the event had taken place in public and involved the police, which meant there was an official record. Moreover, any attempt to warn off journalists would look like a frantic cover-up, coming so soon after the prime minister's preposterous suggestion that drunks should be marched to the nearest cash machine and forced to reveal their PIN numbers. It is unusual for a politician's foray into contemporary morality to backfire quite so speedily, but one of the things even Labour voters dislike about this government is its preachy tone. (No drugs! No squeegee merchants! Don't drink too much! Do you know where your children are?) </p> <p>You would imagine, by now, that even the most uxorious politician, blessed with grown-up offspring who were currently working as volunteers in an inaccessible region of Cambodia, would steer clear of the elephant traps their predecessors have fallen into. Every government, every administration, has a David Mellor or a Dick Morris lurking in its ranks, waiting for an inquisitive journalist to reveal assignations with an actress or, in Morris's case, with a prostitute. Sometimes, as in Clinton's case, it is the top man himself who is a sexual predator and perjurer, but then access to women has long been regarded as a secret perk of American presidents. I am thinking not just of the priapic John F Kennedy but Thomas Jefferson, co-author of the Declaration of Independence, who covertly fathered several children with a mixed-race slave, Sally Hemings. </p> <p> When it comes to blurring the boundary between public and private, it is almost always politicians who are first out of the starting gate. Before he even got within sniffing distance of the White House, Richard Nixon, then a vice-presidential candidate, went on TV in 1952 to make his famous \"Checkers\" speech, a mawkish attempt to quash rumours of a private slush fund. Nixon admitted that the family had received a gift, a cocker spaniel that his six-year-old daughter had named Checkers, and declared defiantly that \"the kids love the dog and we're gonna keep it\". What he failed to mention, in a touching account of his family's straitened circumstances, was accepting a $100,000 bribe from a Romanian industrialist. </p> <p>It is not that every politician has skeletons on this scale lurking in the family closet. Some just have embarrassing relations, like Jimmy Carter's feckless brother or Margaret Thatcher's son, Mark, who famously reduced her to tears when he got lost in a desert. Thatcher, not usually regarded as a maternal figure, even won sympathy for this rare show of emotion in public. </p> <p>But the lessons from history are clear. In the past, politicians could rely on a compliant press to accept their skilful manipulations of family life at face value. This is no longer the case, nor should it be. If presidents and prime ministers parade their wives and children when it suits them, they cannot expect the media to look away when it transpires that they are not quite perfect husbands or parents. </p> <p>All Euan Blair has done, this summer, is behave like a teenager who has recently finished his exams. Like many adolescents, he is occasionally thoughtless and, judging by what happened last month, not yet accustomed to alcohol. The problem Downing Street is currently trying to handle, badly, is not Euan but his father. If the prime minister would like to remove himself and his government from our private lives, I'm sure most of us would be very happy to get out of his. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>"
