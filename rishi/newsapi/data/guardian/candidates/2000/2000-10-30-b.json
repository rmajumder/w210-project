  "With little more than a week to go, America's third best-known candidate is running neck to neck with her opponent in New York state. <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton, the first lady, is eight points clear of Rick Lazio, according to a poll in this morning's New York Times.</p> <p>But another reputable polling organisation, working for the Times's raucous rival the New York Post, puts Lazio two points ahead.</p> <p>Newspapers in the state agree that turn out will be crucial to Clinton's attempt to launch her own political career in the US Senate.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/\" target=\"_new\">New York Times</a>, which has endorsed Al Gore in the main national race, points out the paradox that Clinton could be undermined by the apparently unassailable campaign by the Democrat presidential candidate.</p> <p>The paper says that, \"if it appears that vice president Al Gore is going to win New York easily - this poll suggests that he is 21 points ahead of George W Bush in New York, 52 percent to 31 percent - then Democrats may not bother to turn out in the numbers Mrs Clinton needs to win the race.\"</p> <p>The Times also slyly points out that Lazio may have scored an own goal by launching his most trenchant criticism of Clinton, over her role in health care legislation, during the sensational baseball World Series, featuring the New York Yankees and the New York Mets.</p> <p>Nobody in the city, it seems, was paying much attention to politics last week.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.nypostonline.com/\" target=\"_new\">New York Post</a> rather underscores the point.</p> <p>Its lead story is the celebratory tickertape parade by the victorious Yankees. Inside, it runs an editorial acid attack on Democrat vice-presidential candidate Joe Lieberman, who is also running for the Senate in Connecticut.</p> <p>It starts: \"Does Joe Lieberman know something that nobody else does? Or is he just trying to have it both ways?\"</p> <p>It goes on to question Lieberman's apparently radical shift of views towards Al Gore's liberal line, and concludes: \"So maybe it's not all that surprising that Lieberman decided to maintain a Connecticut bolt-hole. It's all about what's best for Joe, no?\"</p> <p>The Post also gives prominence to the nasty tale of the Republican telephone campaign to discredit Hillary Clinton by linking her to the terror bombing of the US Navy destroyer Dole in Yemen a few weeks ago.</p> <p>The party has wisely dropped the outrageous message, which was relayed to thousands of non-Jewish voters and accused Clinton of accepting money from an Arab organisation that \"openly brags about its support for a Mideast terrorism group, the same kind of terrorism that killed our sailors on the USS Cole.\"</p> <p>The equally strident <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com\" target=\"_new\">New York Daily News</a> - one of its main news stories is headed \"Judge could nix slay rap\" - wastes little time on political analysis.</p> <p>But it does approve of Chelsea Clinton. In a long piece, the paper notes how she is helping her mother's campaign.</p> <p>\"Much about Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton's marriage remains a mystery, but they have indisputably raised a fine daughter - by all accounts, down to earth and spectacularly normal, but equipped with an extraordinary inner strength to endure when her family's private matters came under the harshest of public spotlights.</p> <p>\"It's a reason why Chelsea, a 20-year-old college student, has become such an asset to her mother's Senate campaign - and also a stand-in for the First Lady in her father's waning days in the White House.\"</p> <p>It is, as Americans say, a given that, while New York city remains solidly Democrat, the rest of the sprawling state tilts towards the Republicans.</p> <p>That is reflected in the <a href=\"http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/today\" target=\"_new\">Poughkeepsie Journal</a>, which restricts is coverage of the senatorial race to a glowing account of a Lazio fundraising dinner.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.timesunion.com/Monday.asp\" target=\"_new\">Albany Times Union</a> believes the Lazio campaign is faltering in the traditional conservative parts of the state.</p> <p>The paper highlights the crucial importance of the black vote: \"US Senator Chuck Schumer won his 1998 race against incumbent Alfonse D'Amato, a Republican, with 87 per cent of the black vote.</p> <p>\"This year, African-Americans support Clinton over Lazio by a ratio of 93-3, according to a recent Quinnipiac University poll.\"</p> <p>The paper also notes that the Clinton campaign too has had its up and down moments: \"In Ithaca, she was greeted by an enthusiastic crowd - and a man shouting, 'Mrs Clinton, who did your husband rape today'?\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.dailygazette.com/\" target=\"_new\">Schenectady Daily Gazette</a> reports Al Gore's latest barnstorming tour of California, to shore up his sagging support in a state where many had assumed his victory to be assured.</p> <p>The paper notes his shift to negative attacks on George W Bush's lack of experience</p> <p>\"Late Saturday night, Gore signalled the shift in focus in commenting on his endorsement by The New York Times, which said Bush's knowledge and resume were lacking. 'My already high estimation of The New York Times has risen even further,' Gore told reporters aboard Air Force Two.\"</p>",
  "<p>A government-funded body has come under fire today for spending thousands of pounds on taking a group of advertising and PR execs on a week-long junket to Shanghai.</p> <p>The British Council is paying out an estimated \u00a325,000 for a group of 12 senior players in the advertising, PR and internet industries to present their services to companies in China.</p> <p>The government will foot more than half the bill for the trip through its export organisation, Trade Partners UK, with the remainder being paid for by the British Council - itself half-funded by the taxpayer.</p> <p>Shadow culture secretary Peter Ainsworth called the trip a waste of tax-payers money.</p> <p>The delegates are all contributing to the cost of their trip, which takes place this week, but they will each receive a \u00a3600 grant from Trade Partners UK for travel, accommodation and food in China.</p> <p>One of the most prominent delegates is Chris Powell, chairman of BMP DDB, the ad agency behind the Labour party's 1997 election campaign. Others include Robert Campbell, creative director of ad agency Rainey Kelly Campbell Roalfe/Y&amp;R, Mark Cridge, managing director of the online media agency Glue Media, and Alison Clarke, president of the Institute of Public Relations.</p> <p>Mr Ainsworth said: \"I am a big fan of the ad industry, but I think they rank pretty low down the list of deserving causes. There's no doubt that British companies lead the world in advertising. We are very creative and have a great deal to offer China. But it beats me why the taxpayer should become involved in this.\"</p> <p>Andrew Senior, head of creative industries for the British Council, said: \"The council is increasingly moving across from promoting the arts towards areas such as architecture, film and design. Advertising and PR fit in very well with that. We are not seeking to be an export agency, but advertising is a very strong area for the UK and we recognise that people probably see more advertising than they do anything else.\"</p> <p>Mr Senior added that the creative industries are currently one of the UK's biggest exporters, with 16% of their products being sold overseas.</p> <p>\"They have achieved that with no real government help, which begs the question of what they could do with some help,\" he said. \"You wouldn't get such a diverse mixture of companies getting together for a trip that was funded by the industry.\"</p> <p>The main focus of the trip is a one-day seminar entitled \"Getting results from your communications\", where Chinese companies will see presentations from senior members of the British marketing industry on advertising, PR and new media.</p> <p>The British Council was set up in 1936 to counteract the negative effects of Nazi propaganda on the image of the nation. It is funded partly by the government and partly by income from commercial activities abroad, such as English language teaching.</p>",
  "<p>Two weeks ago, when Al Gore's presidential hopes appeared to be slipping with each new poll, he took a call from his boss, the president. Otherwise shut out of his deputy's campaign, Clinton urged vice-president Gore to watch a Saturday Night Live parody of his TV debates with his Republican rival. After first resisting, Gore acceded to Clinton's almost unerring political instinct. The tape revealed the public's perception of the candidate and his media-genic shortcomings that no pollster or focus group could have bettered. </p> <p>Clinton touched on one of the few political realities of this campaign - that TV comedy has become one of the few clarifying elements of a political discourse obfuscated by hours of punditry, spin and anti-spin. As Americans tune out from serious political coverage and analysis, they are getting more of their election news from late-night talk. A recent survey found that 47% of people aged between 18 and 29 often gleaned information from these programmes, along with a quarter of all adults. </p> <p>\"So much coverage in the main stream press is dishonest and manipulative,\" says Columbia University journalism professor Craig Wolff. \"To me, the humorists are in some ways presenting the most honest coverage.\" </p> <p>Politics as TV comedy is hardly new and has been gaining momentum since Richard Nixon appeared on the 60s show Laugh-In. What's new is just how blurred the line between politics, news and entertainment has become. Late-night comedy talk shows such as those of Jay Leno and David Letterman have become political essentials, both as barometers of how the campaigns are playing (\"If it makes it onto Leno or Letterman that really means something,\" said Gore press secretary Chris Lehane recently) and through appearances by the candidates themselves - a way of personalising their brand. </p> <p>To former Texas governor Anne Richards, it's become almost more important for candidates to show a sense of humour than to demonstrate a grasp of the issues when debating their opponents. A good joke can be incredibly effective in getting your message out, she says, \"because people repeat it\". And that's invaluable for politicians because with an electorate disenchanted with politics and an election said to hinge on a small number of swing voters, humour has become one of the few ways of gaining attention. </p> <p>\"It's a question of the different people you need to reach,\" says political columnist-turned satirist Arianna Huffington. \"There are people who already agree with you, and you can says things as flatly and blandly as you want, and they're with you. But then there are those who need to be convinced that the election matters.\" </p> <p>But while Gore has appeared on Letterman and Leno, and Bush has kissed Oprah Winfrey on Oprah, been on a morning talk show with Regis Philbin, the host of Who Wants to be a Millionaire?, and had an unhappy (and un-repeated) experience on Letterman in March, none of the current crop of candidates besides Gore's democrat running mate Al Lieberman have dared venture on to The Daily Show on Comedy Central. </p> <p>The programme, hosted by Jon Stewart, has emerged as America's sharpest satire. First broadcast in 1996, The Daily Show has become one of the few programmes smart enough to come close to capturing the absurdity not just of the US political process but of the media that cover the news and the pundits that interpret and re-interpret it. </p> <p>In a show presented as a seemingly real newscast, Stewart and his team of correspondents spoof what increasingly feels like unreal news. As the 37-year-old Stewart himself liked to quip during coverage of the political conventions in the summer: \"We're a fake news organisation covering a fake news event.\" But that didn't stop the game (and very funny) senator Bob Dole appearing as the programme's deskbound political pundit, or John McCain agreeing to be interviewed by Stewart faking a real interview. </p> <p>In creating a comedy show that looks like a news broadcast, The Daily Show's formula is to satirise every element of the political process, from the pretensions of the candidates themselves to the over-heated pronouncements of pundits. </p> <p>Some is semi-subtle (Stewart explaining that when Bush says \"subliminable\" instead of subliminal, he was probably thinking of \"executing some criminables\"). Some is not. At the Republican convention a shot of Bush sitting with his wife appeared to reveal an erection. \"Welcome to the Johnson administration,\" quipped the commentary. </p> <p>Since the primaries in January The Daily Show has been covering the election as part of its nightly look at news and events. Indecision 2000, as the political segment is called, is just one part of the proceedings but one that has established the show. Stewart, who started out as a stand-up comedian, and last year made the list of People magazine's 50 Most Beautiful, understands exactly what it's about: \"The longer I'm doing this I'm coming to learn that entertainment, politics and the media are really just juggling the same balls. We're all going for ratings, so we function by the same rules. What's a political poll other than a focus group for a television show?\" </p> <p>Madeleine Smithberg, co-creator of The Daily Show, dates comedy's new importance to the political process from the occassion when Clinton went on the Arsenio Hall show in 1992 and played the saxophone. \"That signalled a whole new ballgame,\" she says. \"This year there's this huge emphasis on entertainment and whether the candi dates can be funny. But it's not like they have stopped doing Sunday morning television or serious talk shows. It's just that we now have this unbelievable proliferation of media venues and everyone is just hedging their bets. Maybe they'll be showing up on sitcoms or on Millionaire. Everyone is pretending they're in it for some sort of noble motive. But we're in it for the laugh. We get to pinpoint the absurdities rampant throughout the system.\" </p> <p>There's no doubt that the constraints of US political life have played into the hands of the satirists, and that the Lewinsky affair finally stripped politics of its last vestiges of propriety. In this election - beyond Bush's aptitude for malapropisms, non-sequiturs and plain nonsense, and Gore's dull monotone - the candidates played themselves into the hands of satirists as never before by going to great lengths to say as little as possible. </p> <p>On Oprah, for instance, the hostess gave each one hour to tell the electorate how much they loved their family and name their favourite food, plus a filmed report called \"Remembering Your Spirit\" on how the Gores and the Bushes preserve the spirit of their marriages. If getting votes means appearing with a man who smashes wooden planks on his head (as Bush did on Letterman) or singing My Way (as Lieberman did on Conan O'Brian) so be it. </p> <p>\"All you really do with comedy,\" says Jay Leno, \"is clarify the news a little. Your role is to take the spin out of the story and get to the joke at its heart.\" CNN's chief political analyst Wolf Blitzer concedes that comedy now has an elevated role in the process. \"There's no doubt all this comedy has an impact,\" he told the New York Times. \"Elections are won and lost on public perception in that kind of popular culture.\" </p> <p>But as the hunt to find and win over the crucial but possibly non-existent \"undecided voter\" peaks before the November 7 vote, US comedians know they have a golden opportunity. To Smithberg, the quest for the undecided voter is itself absurd. \"It's ironic, because the undecided voter has become the most empowered voting block, and these are people who are absolutely incapable of making a decision. We've somehow given this most important decision over to the idiots who can't make a decision! We've empowered the fools.\" </p> <p>If, by some strange fluke, Smithberg's fools are also the ones who watch The Daily Show when it beams out of New York on weekday nights at 11 pm, then late-night comedy might indeed prove to be the deciding factor in the election. But there's really no way of telling. On election night, Stewart and his gang of correspondents will be on duty pinpointing the comedy that is the marriage between political discourse and the media. \"We'll be pinpointing the absurdities. We'll be doing the analysis of the analysis and then analysing that.\" </p> <p><strong> Presidential comedy: the contenders</strong></p> <p><strong>Jay Leno</strong> </p> <p>Lantern-jawed stand-up comic who inherited the Tonight show from Johnny Carson.

  "<p> * The Royle Family's subversion appears to extend beyond its dark scripts: during a long scene last week on BBC1, the sedentary family were glued to SM:TV, ITV's weekend children's show. BBC bosses are understood not to be best pleased that the Granada-made show is plugging the opposition: the Beeb's Saturday morning rival, Live and Kicking, is trailing Ant and Dec in the kids' TV ratings war. Monkey wonders whether Lorraine Heggessey will order Jim Royle to tune into Panorama next week. </p> <p>*More subversiveness at the BBC, with the racy entertainment show Liquid News. Since moving to BBC Choice, this former News 24 offering has flourished under its larger-than-life presenter, the deliciously camp Christopher Price. But teaming Price up with controversial US comic Scott Capuro last week proved a little too much for news bosses, when the pair mused on the quality of German pornography and Capuro had to be reminded that Billy Elliot star Jamie Bell was not yet \"of age\", before he said anything the BBC might regret. Admits one senior BBC executive, secretly chuckling: \"It is one of our gayer shows, in every sense of the word.\" Price's response? \"It's gayer than Newsroom Southeast, I suppose. But only just.\" </p> <p>*Readers fretting about the fate of Mr Blobby after Monkey exclusively revealed Noel Edmonds' heartless plans to ditch the pink one can rest assured. In a personal letter to Monkey, Mr Blobby reveals he is now 80% owned by the \"appallingly proprietorial\" former TV presenter. \"He is now casting me for world domination,\" Mr Blobby says. \"In addition to having to appear every Saturday night on BBC1 alongside the ghastly Jim Davidson, I am forced to star in no fewer than three different pantomime productions in three different cities every Christmas.\" Monkey thanks Mr Blobby for the update but fears he may have to pass up the kind offer of free pantomime tickets. </p> <p>*While staff at Meridian, Anglia and every other corner of the Granada empire brace themselves for more cutbacks, spare a thought for charming boss Charles Allen, who has had to drag himself around Britain explaining his plans to anxious staff. Take last week for instance. Allen had to battle his way through London traffic out to Northolt, west of London, where a private jet, once owned by Forte, awaited to take him all the way to . . . Southampton. </p> <p>*If Channel 4's marketers thought that placing one of their London billboards outside the offices of the Guardian would yield endless column inches for their programmes, they were seriously deluded. Until now. For on his way home from a hard day's media networking, Monkey was stopped in his tracks by the striking image staring down from the other side of Farringdon Road. There, promoting Film Four's hor ror weekend, was a rather familiar face, albeit contorted in mock fear. We didn't think Matt Baker, Channel 4's head of press and part-time model, was so easily scared. </p> <p>*Recent news from Television Centre suggests Greg Dyke is going to new lengths in his drive to eliminate the last vestiges of croissant culture from White City. A missive sent to journalists warns that the Filling Station, one of the BBC's noted gastronomic centres, will be obliged to close for four hours to facilitate . . . the installation of a new toaster. Monkey was amused to note that the ghost of John Birt still looms in so much of the BBC's prose. \"Please be aware that due to the installation of a new toaster the Filling Station will be closed from 15.00 - 19.00hrs on Wednesday 25/10/00. Throughout this time Green Tea Bar in the Main Block will be offering an alternative service. There is already signage in the area advising of the above.\" </p> <p>*How are poor US voters supposed to make up their minds when advertising agencies contrive to make everything so confusing? An election billboard that last week appeared by the side of a US highway proclaimed \"Gore 2000\", but pictured the grinning features of presidential rival George W Bush. Boone-Oakely, the agency behind the gaffe, admitted the error but refused to divulge which candidate it was trying to promote. </p> <p>*To lose one of your star writers is unfortunate, but to lose two looks like pure carelessness. So Daily Mail bosses had better get started with their love-bombing if they are to retain the services of chief crime correspondent Peter Rose and at least one other senior writer who has been made an offer by a rival newspaper. Rose, who has been with the Mail for 14 years, this week handed in his notice after being wooed by the News of the World, where he will be crime editor. Rose, who has broken too many scoops to list, was evidently appreciated by some at the Mail. He is only the third person in the history of the paper to have been anointed with the title chief crime correspondent.</p>",
  "The Gore camp's claim that a vote for Green presidential candidate Ralph Nader is, in effect, a vote for George W Bush will be familiar to third parties everywhere. How often has the British electorate been told by both big parties that supporting the Liberal Democrats (or the Greens, or anybody else for that matter) is a waste of a vote? Fortunately such pernicious duopoly has not quite annihilated multi-party democracy in Britain, though not for want of trying by Labour and the Tories. The \"wasted vote\" argument is harder to sustain in countries (that is to say, most modern democracies) that use proportional representation to reflect all shades of opinion. But in first-past-the-post contests such as that in the US, where all a state's electoral college votes normally go to the candidate with a plurality, the impact of such spoiling tactics on inclusive representative politics is potentially very damaging. <p>Inclusion should be an issue of concern for both Democrats and Republicans. Whichever way the contest goes on November 7, the \"winner\" will be the dark horse known as apathy. On past experience, 50% or more of eligible voters will not cast a ballot at all. The successful candidate can thus hope to have the active support of, at most, one in four Americans. This dismal prospect is not solely the product of the close but uninspiring Bush-Gore contest. Participation in presidential elections has been falling steadily since the 1960s. Indeed, it sometimes seems that relatively weak, voyeuristic Britain (or Britain's media) is more excited by White House power-politics than are Americans themselves. </p> <p>It cannot be assumed that the 5% or so of voters who may support Mr Nader (and who could in theory thwart Mr Gore in some marginal states) would vote at all were he not in the race. By offering a radically different, iconoclastic vision, Mr Nader effectively enfranchises many alienated voters - and does sterling service to a democracy in decline.</p>",
  "Bill Clinton waded into the closest US presidential race in decades for the first time yesterday, pleading with voters to stop George W Bush capturing the White House for the Republicans a week tomorrow. <p>While Al Gore campaigned in Michigan, which has emerged as the number one battleground state in the neck-and-neck November 7 contest, the president climbed into a church pulpit to urge black Americans to get out the vote for the Democratic candidate. </p> <p>\"I am pleading with you. I've done everything I know to turn this country around, to pull this country together, to move us forward. </p> <p>\"I have done everything I know to do,\" Mr Clinton told worshippers at the Shiloh Baptist church in Washington. </p> <p>\"We still have bridges to cross. We still have dreams to build for our children. The choices are stark and clear and will have great consequences,\" he added. </p> <p>\"So talk to your friends, talk to your neighbours, talk to your family members, talk to your co-workers and make sure nobody takes a pass on November 7. Learn, decide and choose.\" </p> <p>But as Mr Clinton prepared to hit the campaign trail later this week in California and the south, where he will concentrate on energising black voters and other minorities, the Gore camp made it clear that it intend to keep the president at arm's length in the main electoral battleground, win or lose. </p> <p>\"I appreciate that he's out there, but I think the fact is that Bill Clinton's name is not on the ballot,\" Mr Gore's running mate, Senator Joe Lieberman, said yesterday. </p> <p>\"The people are going to be voting for Al Gore and me, or George Bush and Dick Cheney.\" </p> <p>\"We're not looking for any help here. Al Gore is his own man,\" the deputy campaign director, Mark Fabiani, said. </p> <p>With just eight days to go to election day, Mr Bush remained ahead in all the national opinion polls, whose margins ranged from one to seven points in a kaleidoscope of different surveys. </p> <p>He led Mr Gore 49% to 42% in the latest Gallup tracking survey, which posted a 13-point Bush lead on Friday. In the latest Washington Post tracking poll, by contrast, Mr Bush was ahead of Mr Gore by 47% to 46%. </p> <p>The uncertainty of the outcome in the contest was underlined by a clutch of new polls in the battleground states which gave Mr Gore a narrow overall advantage, foreshadowing the possibility that the vice-president may lose in the popular vote next week but win enough electoral college votes in the states to capture the White House. </p> <p>Polls in nine battleground states by the Zogby organisation for Reuters/MSNBC showed Mr Gore ahead by five points in Florida, by six in Wisconsin and by seven in Illinois. He led by four points in Missouri and two in Washington state. </p> <p>Mr Bush led by 11 points in Mr Gore's home state of Tennessee, by three in Ohio and by seven in Pennsylvania, where he previously trailed in most polls. The two men were dead level in Michigan. </p> <p>Of the 153 electoral college votes up for grabs in the nine states, Mr Gore would win 80 on the basis of these polls, and Mr Bush take 55, leaving Michigan's 18 still undecided. That would put Mr Gore narrowly ahead in the battle for the 270 electoral college votes needed for victory. </p> <p>While Mr Bush continues to look and act like the favourite, announcing plans yesterday to concentrate his campaign this week in states which Mr Clinton carried in 1996, Mr Gore won the most prestigious of an avalanche of weekend newspaper endorsements when the New York Times gave him its support in an editorial headed simply \"Al Gore for president\". </p> <p>\"We firmly endorse Al Gore as the man best equipped for the presidency by virtue of his knowledge of government, his experience at the top levels of federal and diplomatic decision-making, and his devotion to the general welfare,\" the Times wrote. </p> <p>Of Mr Bush, the paper said his qualifications were \"too thin for the nation to bet on his growing into the kind of leader he claims already to be\". America's prosperity and achievements \"could be undone in a flash by a pliable and inexperienced president driven by a highly ideological Congress,\" it warned.</p>",
  "Eight days left; a near dead heat in the polls; excitement and apprehension rise. What hangs on Bush? What swings with Gore? Time to calm down, even hose down. So I went to see the supreme guru of measured analysis for an extra helping of laid-back wisdom. Professor Seymour Martin Lipset, in London for a lecture tonight, has been America's best, most prolific political scientist for four decades now. He has watched all the presidents of that time come and go - but, more important, he has watched the changes in his country, too. He is in no sense cynical or battle-worn, but he is relaxed. <p>Is George Dubya a raving right-winger? Nah! He's a \"right centrist\"; just like Al Gore is a \"left centrist\". Both naturally congregate in the middle. Bush started off in the familiar out-of-town way, attacking Congress and Washington, but then McCain cropped up and he had to veer for a while to the right of his party. Now he has tacked back to where he started from. Gore, in parallel, had to see off Nader before turning turtle. </p> <p>Remember what Nixon told Bob Dole. \"You head right to get the nomination; you head left the moment you've got it.\" Remember that Ronnie Reagan's California was the first state to pass a pro-abortion bill and that Ron spent his time in the sun trawling round anti-abortion meetings making mood music but never doing a damned thing. \"Remember, except for foreign policy, that the president is weak. Clinton hasn't got his last budget yet.\" </p> <p>You can talk about what you intend to do. Doing it in office is wholly different - and the talkers and the promisers know that, just as the voters do. Look at the way Capitol Hill inevitably operates, seldom giving any one party control of the White House, the Senate and the Congress. No accident, because different constituencies. Choosing a president is one thing; choosing a senator to represent the broad swath of opinion in his state is another; choosing a congressman with a far narrower, more defined and partisan constituency is still another. There is an almost automatic balance. Maybe, just maybe, the Republicans will take all three this time, but if they do it will be by such a narrow margin that the soft blur of party lines - especially in the Senate - will leave scant room for manoeuvre anyway. </p> <p>And foreign policy? Lipset knows Condaleeza Rice, the likely national security adviser, well. A strong, bright lady. He knows Colin Powell, the likely secretary of state, and the other prospective aides clustering at his side. He is unalarmed. They are capable people. Whatever else Bush may or may not be, he looks like a good chooser. </p> <p>If you are as mellow as Lipset, you see awful (alleged) threats in a kindlier light. Whatever happened to the (1980s) threat of \"a natural Republican majority\"? Education happened. The Republicans still have an armlock on the deep South - except where the Democrats work to a strict black agenda - but their Golden West isn't so golden any longer. Folks got richer and thus they became more educated. Funny thing! That doesn't help the Republicans one jot. The more you know - in the broadest terms - the likelier you are to vote Democrat. And the awful threat of a swelling Hispanic population, the death of America as a homogeneous, English-speaking nation? Another defunct spectre. </p> <p>\"There isn't a Hispanic race. There are Argentines and Guatemalans and Spanish and Mexicans. They come from different countries - and they are different. I'm told Texan Mexicans and California Mexicans are different. But what happens to them all? They arrive, some of them prosper, and they become Americans who want to speak English, must speak English, because not being able to marks them out as second class.\" Natural, unafraid integration. </p> <p>Anyway, immigration is the key. \"I went to lecture in Japan a few years ago, when the Japanese miracle was going full speed, and I got annoyed. America, I told them, is an open society - and where would you be if we didn't buy your cars? Every society goes soft in the end and we've got the answer to that. We let in hungry people. I have no fear of you. Our Asians will beat you in the end.\" </p> <p>The temptation, as he rattles along, is to think him complacent. This is a temptation to resist. Lipset is a shrewd observer of what really comes to pass and what may happen next once the headlines have faded. He is absorbed not just by the activists of politics, but by the millions in the middle who, frankly, aren't that interested. Voter turnout heads down. Some 30m watched the recent televised debates, as opposed to 90m when they first started. </p> <p> But is that necessarily bad - or just that the missing ones don't think it makes much difference who wins, who holds the centre? If they think that, they may not be all wrong. But watch, with satisfaction, Pat Buchanan and the cracked shell of the Perot party disappear below 1% on the polls. Apathy can be the enemy of extremism. Because folk don't care this time, though, doesn't mean that they won't care next time if there is an issue they see clutching them by the throat. \"This is not an angry country, whatever the commentators say. Some have strong views, maybe strong religious views. But they're not angry now.\" </p> <p>The virtue of the political scientist lies in setting a broader context and noticing what happens offstage. Has American \"exceptionalism\" - the totality of factors that set it apart, and the theme of one of Lipset's most lauded books - changed in the last five years? Yes: and he offers an example from his time at Stanford University in the Palo Alto shadow of Silicon Valley. Call it the explosion of young wealth. </p> <p>Look at house prices in Palo Alto. Almost everyone who lives there is a millionaire; indeed, has to be to live there. \"I went to a cocktail party and there were 13 billionaires in the room.\" He has a daughter who works as a psychiatric social worker in the city and some of her patients have a recurring question for her. \"What am I going to do with my money?\" Maybe lose it; maybe pour it into the universities and charitable foundations, maybe build new palaces in Newport, Rhode Island, to dwarf the palaces that America's industrial rich built in the 1890s. </p> <p>At any rate, what's exceptional about the American future \"is a bigger, wealthier class\". It alters the balances; it chips away at the accustomed order of things. \"Elites, you know, are very anxious what people think of them. They want to be thought well of and they're anxious to help that process.\" </p> <p>A new era of philanthropy? Perhaps. But probably a new era of exceptionalism which leaves Europe and \"post- feudal\" Britain behind. Lipset's legacy: don't get mad, get reflective and get informed. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto: peter.preston@theguardian.com\">peter.preston@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "Nine months ago this column had a scoop. It was here that the world first learned that Ralph Nader would run for the presidency. The world turned over and went back to sleep. To the American press, beginning its lethal infatuation with GW Bush, Nader was an icon of the 60s who had passed his sell-by date. I had always admired the man. Few had done more for the American citizen than Nader and his Raiders in creating a countervailing force to big business and big government. But I can't say I was stunned that he got only the odd paragraph here when he finally announced. Hardly anybody came to his earnest little meetings. It seemed just another Quixotic candidacy. <p>Now everything is changed. Nader is besieged by the pressmen who found him boring only a few months ago. The New York Times gives up a lead editorial to castigate him for self-indulgence, \"ego run amok\". It would be piquant if it weren't so painful. Nader dominates the last few days because he threatens to be Teddy Roosevelt to William Howard Taft in 1912, Ross Perot to George Bush in 1992. Teddy split the right-inclined vote to let in Woodrow Wilson, Perot took 19% of the vote to let in Bill Clinton, and Nader is splitting the left-inclined vote to let in GW. Nader won't win a single state but in a neck-and-neck race he threatens to take enough votes from Al Gore to deliver Minnesota and Oregon and maybe also Wisconsin, Michigan and Washington to Bush. In short, to condemn the country to the forces of reaction he has spent his life fighting. I asked him to explain himself. </p> <p> <b> HE:</b> Why are you what the Times calls the wrecking-ball candidate? </p> <p> <b> RN:</b> I didn't know that the two party system was enshrined in our constitution. </p> <p> <b> HE:</b> But you will let in Bush who is against all you stand for. </p> <p> <b> RN:</b> These guys are both the same. They've given up government to the big corporations. </p> <p> <b> HE:</b> But surely Gore is closer to your position? You called Bush a big corporation running for president disguised as a person. </p> <p> <b> RN: </b> Gore is a stumbling person. If he can't beat a bumbling Bush with a horrific record in Texas, what use is he to us? Fact is, these Republicans in Congress are sons of bitches fighters and the Democrats are weak. And we have three things going for us if Bush wins. One, he doesn't like conflict. Two, he's stupid. Three, he's lazy. Actually the Republicans may even be better on corporate welfare. </p> <p> <b> HE:</b> But Gore has promised to make his first priority getting rid of soft money and Bush hasn't. </p> <p> <b> RN:</b> I don't believe Gore will do it. He and Clinton had plenty of time to do it in the last eight years. </p> <p> <b> HE:</b> But why don't you give Gore a break by backing out of the key states where you threaten him? </p> <p> <b> RN: </b> What would it take? He has not moved one bit to meet us. Not on making cars that do 30 to 40 miles per gallon, not on regulating bio-tech regulation... </p> <p> <b> HE:</b> You've attacked Gore on the environment but don't tell me his record isn't better than Bush, who incredibly won't move on global warming without more studies. </p> <p> <b> RN: </b> I agree Gore is better on two things. He'd keep the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge closed to drilling. He's good on the wilderness. But Gore has done some bad things. In the transition he gave the nod for an incinerator in Ohio he should have stopped. OK, he gets a D-plus and Bush gets a D-minus, but they both flunk. </p> <p> <b> HE:</b> You like quoting Alfred North Whitehead that duty arises out of the power to alter the course of events. Don't you a have duty here? </p> <p> <b> RN: </b> I'm not a referee, I'm not trying to be a kingmaker. I'm trying to build a progressive political reform movement. Thousands of young people are pouring in. Fifteen thousand people paid $20 each to get into Madison Square Gardens. We've had only 1% of the money, 1% of the media, we've been barred from the television debates and we've had to fight statutory restrictions just to get on the ballot in 45 states.Yet we're going to get millions of votes. But all I get is \"You're a spoiler, you're taking Al Gore's vote.\" Only Al Gore is taking votes from Al Gore. </p> <p> The gleeful Republicans don't see it that way. They reckon a vote for Nader is a vote for Bush. The Republican leadership council is launching pro-Nader TV ads featuring a speech in which he attacked Gore on \"eight years of principles betrayed and promises broken\". Of course, they have excised the Nader attack on Bush in the same speech. Ralph, meet your new friends. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto: comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>In a few days' time two things will happen that could reshape the global economy. The United States will elect a new president amid blanket media coverage. And, very quietly in New York, a door will close on the chance to influence the best kept secret in global economic governance - the United Nations-led finance for development process. </p> <p>The campaign that took Bill Clinton to the White House had as its slogan, \"it's the economy, stupid\". It answered the unspoken question: \"what's the big issue?\" If the question were now asked about globalisation, the reply would be: \"it's democracy, stupid\". </p> <p>Two thirds of the world's countries lack democratic control over their economies. In an age when financial institutions proclaim transparency, a simple comprehensive list of countries that are subject to hugely influential agreements with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund is not readily available, even to many of the bank's own staff. </p> <p>But why does it matter? The poet Dante said that, of all the hidden truths, the \"most useful and most unknown\" was knowledge of temporal world governance. </p> <p>If you tried to buy votes in a national election there would be allegations and court cases. At the international financial institutions, buying votes has been considered a virtue since Harry Dexter White of the US treasury department said at the founding of the World Bank and IMF, \"the more money you put in, the more votes you have\". That is how the Group of Seven wealthy countries, who do not use the organisations' services, came to control nearly 50% of the votes on their boards. It is the modern equivalent of 17th-century rule by aristocracy. </p> <p>All the developing and transitional economies put together, who rely on the institutions' services, control only around four in every 10 votes. At the United Nations General Assembly those same countries have more than eight out of 10 votes. </p> <p>Adding insult to penury, a committee set up to reformulate voting allocations at the IMF recently came to an embarrassingly wrong conclusion. The so-called \"Cooper Report\" suggested a scheme that would increase the United States' already dominant influence, and shrink Africa's small voice. The fact that Asia, too, would benefit little from proposed quota changes is likely to encourage those calling for a separate Asian Monetary Fund, one more in tune with the region's needs. </p> <p>The original vision for the UN included a role in global economic management to ensure more equal distribution of the benefits from trade and development. But, as the bank and fund have grown more influential, UN agencies have been undermined, attempts to control multinational corporations shelved and senior staff removed. </p> <p>Conservative philosopher Karl Popper wrote that an open society needed democratic institutions. He believed only genuinely democratic institutions could solve problems. The World Bank and IMF have proved appalling at solving problems. Popper also crystallised the inherent contradiction of the free markets, writing: \"The paradox of economic freedom, which makes possible the unrestrained exploitation of the poor by the rich ... results in the almost complete loss of economic freedom by the poor.\" </p> <p>Seen like this the financial institutions become enemies of an open global society. While they aspire to be universal, they ferociously protect minority rule of the world economy. Under this regime the anomalies and inequalities of globalisation have darkly flowered. But now there is a chance to correct historical wrongs, and reshape global governance. The UN has begun a little talked about process called finance for development. </p> <p>Technically, it is meant to try to give poor countries a better deal in everything from trade to aid. Its deeper mission is to write new terms of engagement between the UN and the World Bank, IMF and World Trade Organisation. But the first opportunity to influence the outcome and set the scope of the process will be over next week, almost before anyone is aware that it has begun. </p> <p>The street protests that seem set to haunt every international economic meeting are just another symptom of the global democratic deficit. They will welcome the new US president as representative of the largest vote holder in the institutions that guarantee minority rule. When his advisers wring their hands and in the coming months inevitably cry, \"why are the protesters getting at us?\" the president should turn to them and sagely whisper, \"it's democracy, stupid\". </p> <p>\u0095 Andrew Simms is head of the global economy programme at the New Economics Foundation</p>",
  "<p>The economic backdrop to next week's pre-Budget report could hardly be brighter. Inflation is below the government's 2.5% target despite more than eight years of strong growth and an ever-tightening labour market, the current account is widening but not at an alarming pace and the public finances are in good shape. </p> <p>With an election possibly just over six months away, the temptation for Gordon Brown to \"do a Lawson\" and conclude he has achieved an economic miracle must be intense. Thankfully, the chancellor signalled last week at the G20 finance ministers' meeting in Montreal that he would not be bounced into a rash pre-election giveaway. </p> <p>Mr Brown's caution is well founded. True, estimates of the likely budget surplus this year range from the Treasury's ultra-cautious \u00a35bn to well over \u00a320bn. In all likelihood, Mr Brown will be forced to revise upwards his forecast given the outturn for the first six months of the year shows a surplus of \u00a34.6bn. But continued modesty in his projections is to be welcomed. </p> <p>However, the British economy has been here before and it did not end happily. As Nigel Lawson demonstrated in the late 80s, it is easy to be deceived by a temporary improvement in public finances. Then, with money flooding into the exchequer, Mr Lawson slashed taxes in the belief that the economy's sustainable growth rate had shifted up a gear, only to leave his successors with a hole in the public finances when the UK went into recession. </p> <p>Today's situation is not dissimilar. Since Black Wednesday, the economy has been full of good surprises. It is tempting to believe that the supply side reforms of the 80s are beginning to pay off in terms of an increase of the economy's sustainable growth rate from its historic trend of 2.25%-2.5%. Estimates of 3% do not seem unreasonable. </p> <p>But it may also be true that low inflation is due to what Lawrence Meyer, a Federal Reserve board member, has in the US context called \"temporary bliss\" factors, such as the pound's surprising strength on the foreign exchanges, the massive deflationary impulse from the Asian crisis or the (previously) low oil price. In other words, luck rather than good policies may be responsible for the economy's remarkable performance. </p> <p>Faced with this uncertainty, it seems sensible to proceed with caution, basing forecasts for the public finances on a trend rate of growth of 2.25% and using any spare cash which accumulates to pay down debt rather than substantially increase spending or cut taxes just yet. </p> <p>Professor Laura D'Andrea Tyson, President Clinton's national economic adviser during his first term, was in London last week to deliver the Economic and Social Research Council's annual lecture. She reminded the audience that one of the foundation stones of America's new economy was the decision to cut the budget deficit in the early 90s. It made room for an easier monetary policy which, in turn, created a climate in the capital markets supportive of IT investment. And IT investment appears to have been one of the main ingredients of the US's productivity miracle which everyone from Japan to Germany is trying to copy. </p> <p>None of this prevents the chancellor distributing a few few fiscal lollipops next week. The margin of error built into projections of the public finances using a growth yardstick of 2.25% means Mr Brown can afford to make some minor concessions without endangering the long-term health of the public finances. He has already signalled that there will be some extra help for pensioners to make up for the infamous 75p increase last year. It is likelypensioners will be granted a temporary above-inflation rise to tide them over to the introduction in 2003 of a new pensioner credit, details of which are expected to be outlined next week. But there will be no permanent restoration of the link between earnings and pensions. </p> <p>Hauliers and the rural lobby can also expect to be grudgingly bought off with targeted measures such as rebates off fuel duty but their demand for a real-terms cut in petrol duty is likely to be ignored. Not only would it send the wrong signal about the government's attitude to the environment, it could also add too much pressure to demand when there is still a danger of higher interest rates. Standing up to the petrol protesters will be politically risky but a repeat of such a spontaneous event as September's fuel crisis seems unlikely, especially if public sympathy is watered down by top-up spending on health and education. This ought to be possible by switching money saved elsewhere in the Budget on unemployment or debt interest. </p> <p>From the chancellor's point of view, however, the meat of the report will be a range of micro measures designed to improve productivity, a yawn for the average voter but, in the long run, the key to preventing the tightness of the labour market spilling over into inflation. </p> <p>Generally speaking, two models of productivity are on offer: the European one, which succeeds by keeping unproductive people out of the workforce (downside: high unemployment); and the American one, which give all available workers lots of capital to work with but treats them like drones (downside: long hours and unhappy people). </p> <p>Mr Brown is trying to steer a middle path, introducing a wide range of measures to get more people into workforce, such as the New Deal, and improve their skills and employability through investment in education and training. </p> <p>He is also continually devising new ways of persuading the private sector to step up investment spending. The public and private sectors working together will, in theory, achieve a productivity breakthrough that will close the gap with the US, France and Germany. </p> <p>Micro initiatives can be expected from Mr Brown next week, including publication of the interim report by Paul Myners on the fund management industry which is likely to recommend reform or abolition of the minimum funding requirement, seen by the Treasury as a barrier to investment in venture capital. Mr Brown will also announce plans for a tax credit encouraging investors to put money into cash-starved entrepreneurial activity in poor urban and rural areas. </p> <p>Compared to the productivity improvements being forced on businesses by the strong pound (the government's unspoken policy for persuading manufacturing to raise its game), such schemes will achieve only marginal gains but they extract little cost and therefore seem worth trying. The trick Mr Brown appears to be attempting to pull off is to appear very busy while doing little that can cause harm. </p> <p>In the short term such a strategy may lack political excitement and, in the eyes of some, courage but in the long run it could reap big rewards. If the public finances continue to improve at the current rate, by next March's Budget Mr Brown could be able to offer modest, affordable tax cuts and hold out the the promise of a second Labour term characterised by further substantial increases in public spending. By holding his nerve, Mr Brown is likely to be in a position to spend a lot more in the future. Judging by his comments in Canada last week, he has realised this. Let's hope Number 10 has, too.</p>"
