  "Al Gore and George W Bush will hold three 90-minute television presidential election debates next month under an agreement made in Washington by their representatives. <p>The vice-presidential candidates, Joe Lieberman and Dick Cheney, will hold one televised debate, the agreement says. </p> <p>The deal to settle a festering argument between the two camps about the number and format of this year's debates is a total victory for the Democratic candidate, Mr Gore, and an equally comprehensive climbdown by his Republican opponent, Mr Bush, who favoured more informal talkshow-style confrontations. </p> <p>Mr Gore's camp said the agreement was \"a victory for the American people\", while the Bush camp said its man was now \"looking forward to a free-flowing, substantive, real and genuine discussion of all the issues\". </p> <p>The Bush team is believed to have caved in when the dispute threatened to harm the Texas governor's ratings and sap energy from his campaign. </p> <p>Mr Gore's preparations were given a further boost yesterday when an anonymous supporter sent his team a copy of a video tape of Mr Bush rehearsing with aides for the debates. Sources in the two camps confirmed that the tape was authentic. </p> <p>The agreement commits the two men to a series of debates exactly as originally proposed by the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, the body which has supervised debates in US elections since 1988, established precisely to avoid the kind of stand-off which has taken place in the past three weeks. </p> <p>The four debates are scheduled to begin after the end of the Olympics, as the candidates begin the intense five-week run-up to polling day on the November 7. They will be carried live on all the main national television networks. </p> <p>The first Gore-Bush debate will be in Boston on October 3, followed by Winston-Salem on October 11 and St Louis on October 17. The Lieberman-Cheney debate will be in Danville on October 5. </p> <p>There will almost certainly be no place in them for the third-party candidates, Ralph Nader of the Greens and Pat Buchanan of the Reform party. Neither has come close to the 15% opinion-poll rating that the commission sets as the threshold for taking part. </p> <p>The agreement ends Mr Bush's attempt to change the format of the debates towards more informal, interview-style events which he hoped would be more to his advantage. </p> <p>He originally proposed that there should be studio debates on NBC's Meet the Press and CNN's Larry King Live, and just one of the debates proposed by the commission. </p> <p>The mysterious videotape of Mr Bush's rehearsals was sent to a former Democratic congressman, Tom Downey, in Washington and carried an Austin, Texas, postmark. It showed Mr Bush debating with the New Hampshire Republican senator Judd Gregg, who took the part of Mr Gore, at Mr Bush's ranch about a month ago. Mr Downey passed the video to the FBI. </p> <p>\u0095Most Americans believe that executions should be halted until the completion of a study of how fairly the death penalty is applied, an opinion poll shows. </p> <p>The poll by American Viewpoint and Peter D Hart Research shows that 59% favour a moratorium and 29% are opposed. Although it shows that most Americans still support capital punishment - 31% fully and 29% with reservations - the combined figure is the lowest for 19 years.</p>",
