  "<p>The world's most powerful industrial nations have launched a two-pronged attack to cut the price of oil and revive the ailing euro. </p> <p>Up to $5 billion is understood to have been spent by the Group of Seven countries - the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, the UK and Canada - in an attempt to stabilise the European single currency last Friday. </p> <p>It is the first time that the British Government has intervened in the market for sterling since Black Wednesday on 16 September, 1992. </p> <p>At a press conference here yesterday the Chancellor, Gordon Brown - in remarkably robust form after a week of 'little local difficulties' - dismissed questions about if he would resign with the quip: 'I'm far too busy.' </p> <p>Brown recalled that he had said in May that the value of the pound against the euro 'cannot be justified by any view of long-term economic fundamentals'. That was when a pound was worth 3.33 deutschmarks. On the eve of Friday's intervention, in which the Treasury apparently told the Bank of England to sell at least $70 million worth of sterling, the rate was DM3.27. </p> <p>It appears that the Chan cellor was not prepared alone to reduce the over-valued exchange rate, but responded swiftly to a request from the European Central Bank last Thursday. </p> <p>Brown said yesterday: 'I've always said I understood people's concern [about the pound] but I've also said they would not have thanked me if we had moved back to the policies of boom and bust.' </p> <p>The Chancellor rejected Opec's suggestions that Western governments could help by lowering fuel taxes. He emphasised that the oil cartel had already committed itself to the view that the sustainable oil price was between $22 and $28 a barrel and its member states would increase production to bring the price down to that level. </p> <p>In Washington, President Bill Clinton yesterday defended his decision to tap US oil reserves to help the price fall. He coupled it with a major heating aid programme to poor families. </p> <p>Clinton said his release of 30 million barrels at the request of the Democratic Party's presidential candidate, Vice-President Al Gore, was 'good energy policy, good national security and good family policy'. </p> <p>He coupled it to a four-point crisis plan, allocating $400m of oil heating allowances to poor families facing big winter bills.</p>",
  "<p>Tony Blair may have had a tough time last week. But if he wants to know how much worse it could get, he should look across the North Sea to Denmark. There, his opposite number Poul Nyrup Rasmussen is fighting for his life over the defining issue of the age still clouding the UK horizon - Europe and, more specifically, its single currency. </p> <p>It is not just Rasmussen whose credibility is at stake. Employer and union leaders have together invested significant time and money in trying to persuade their people to accept something about which they are famously sceptical. </p> <p>The Danes are making them sweat. Daily Gallup polls published by the Berlingske Tidende newspaper ahead of this week's referendum on adopting the euro resemble a jagged pair of scissors - with Yes voters pointing down, and an eight point gap with the ascendant nay-sayers. </p> <p>The outcome of Thursday's plebiscite has profound consequences for the shape and direction of the European project. A No vote could not only knock the credibility of the juddering currency further; it will also make negative results in future referendums, due in Sweden as well as in Britain, far more likely. </p> <p>This would throw the heart of the project into doubt just as it is moving from consolidation to expansion. And it could place a new economic and political curtain between the far north-east of Europe and the teutonic mainland. </p> <p>But the notoriously independent Danes take a delicious pleasure in watching their leaders writhe. </p> <p>From the island-capital Copenhagen to the remote industrial towns of Jutland, 'Ja' and 'Nej' voters alike reserve their scorn for Rasmussen, their employers and the unions. </p> <p>Poul Nyrup has blundered, they say. The beleaguered yes coalition is 'ridiculous', 'panic-stricken', 'pathetic'. </p> <p>For business and unions, the situation could not be worse. Jorgen Hansen, deputy director-general of the employers' group Dansk Industri, says: 'It is important we get a Yes. In Denmark we have almost 100 per cent support for the euro among both big and small business. The unions are the same.' </p> <p>For their part, unions have warned of 35,000 job losses if there is a No. That represents 1.5 per cent of the workforce. </p> <p>But while industrial leaders may be convinced, their employees - particularly female workers and those in the public sector - are not. 'As we learnt in the 1992 referendum on Maastricht, they are suspicious of the elite,' says Hansen. </p> <p>The pro-euro coalition has been using its impeccable network to fight back. Rasmussen has been invited by companies far and wide to meet Denmark's workers and put the case for the single currency. </p> <p>On Tuesday morning, for example, he was speaking in an industrial estate in the Copenhagen suburb of Brondby, home to Denmark's stock market star, NKT holdings. </p> <p>This is the kind of business politicians like to be connected with. Founded in the nineteenth century, NKT now employs 6,500 people and is Denmark's foremost provider of telecommunications. Its shares rose 600 per cent after it spun off a chip designer to Intel earlier this year for $1.25 billion. </p> <p>Managing director Tom Knutzen represents the views of the frustrated majority of Europhile businessmen who are desperate to see a Yes vote on Thursday. 'This morning the Prime Minister in person was extremely dedicated and strongly believed in his arguments,' he says. 'In the Danish press it has been more difficult.' </p> <p>Similar concerns are found away from the Copenhagen media mel\u00e9e. Grundfos has been making domestic and industrial pumps in the town of Bjerringbro in Jutland since 1945, and now has about 10 per cent of the global market. </p> <p>This is another Danish success story. Investment has made the huge factories which dominate Bjerringbro - including an inhouse chip plant - into some of the most highly automated and modern facilities in Denmark. Rasmussen has taken his roadshow there too. </p> <p>Executive vice president Jens Jorgen Madsen says: 'We can't imagine that anyone can dream of saying No to the euro.' But he adds: 'The campaigning and debate have been at an ignorant level.' </p> <p>NKT and Grundfos have similar economic and commercial reasons for wanting to join - some of which will be familiar to UK businessmen: lower transaction costs, ease of trading, the attraction for domestic and inward investment. NKT does some 50 per cent of its business in the euro zone; for Grundfos the figure is 60 per cent. </p> <p>Madsen says: 'We do most of our trade there. We simply cannot understand how it would be better to be outside.' </p> <p>But they also point to specifically Danish factors - chief of which is that since 1982 the Danish krone has been linked first to the deutschmark and now to the euro. </p> <p>Hansen says this means there are major disadvantages to staying out: 'We must follow what the ECB does. But we have no influence at the committees.' </p> <p>And, as Knutzen points out, Danish businesses and taxpayers have to put up with higher debt costs while the krone is outside the euro. Base rates are half a percentage point higher than the ECB's. 'You will always pay a premium while you are outside.' </p> <p>Knutzen estimates that NKT is losing between DKr10 million and DKr20m a year by being 'out'. Grundfos calculates the figure at DKr10m a year for every percentage point above the ECB rate. </p> <p>Rasmussen has attempted to raise the stakes on the currency front. Speculators are ready to pounce on the DKr if it is 'weakened' by a No vote; Denmark has spent DKr10 billion defending the currency as the Yes campaign has lost ground. </p> <p>The difficulty is that, worrying as these problems are, raising them invites accusations of scaremongering. </p> <p>Analysts and economists point out that while in the short term there may be a base-rate hike of 100 points if Denmark stays out, the long-term differences are unlikely to be great - certainly not as great as in 1992. The effect on the level of the euro is less certain, as US and Japanese central banks intervened on Friday to defend it. </p> <p>The ascendant No campaign bridges left and right. </p> <p>Niels Meyer, a professor of physics and spokesman for the leftish June movement, says: 'Because we have referendums, the Danish people are very well informed. They remember the arguments from 1992 and leaders overstating economic problems. People can see that economic arguments are not the real concern.' </p> <p>Here Denmark diverges further from the UK. Current UK debate focuses on economic problems - manufacturing jobs and inward investment - reflecting the fortunes of sterling floating against the euro. </p> <p>But the Danes' first priority is democracy, says Meyer. 'The idea of a united states of Europe is something the Danes do not want. They believe the euro will be a quantum leap towards that.' </p> <p>Their second is welfare: 'The Nordic countries have high taxes, welfare and pensions. The rest of the EU has insurance, lower benefits, and lower taxes. With EU harmonisation, Denmark faces lower welfare and smaller pensions.' </p> <p>This sounds plausible, and it has whipped up a storm. Many believe the No campaign is on weak ground - but this is insignificant next to the mess Rasmussen has made of it. First he sought a deal with his coalition allies - the Conservatives and the liberal Venstre party - then he demanded that all EU governments guarantee that there would be no adverse effect on pensions. Panic, shouted his foes. </p> <p>Even Anders Jensen of the pro-euro European Movement says: 'Rasmussen badly overreacted to the pensions issue.' </p> <p>Jensen also admits the supremacy of political arguments. Back in March, when the referendum was declared, a report by the Danish Independent Economic Council - dubbed the Danish Wise Men - found that the economic benefits of membership were negligible. He believes this is wrong. </p> <p>At the same time, fears about loss of sovereignty were heightened by the EU sanctions imposed on Austria after the election win of far-right politician J\u00f6rg Haider. Danes were outraged at the breach of sovereignty. </p> <p>Jensen says: 'There is a balance between the economic gain of entry and the political cost. The Wise Men said there was little gain; the Austrian situation pointed to a great loss.' The polls have criss-crossed ever since. </p> <p>Now, with the vote closing fast, even businessmen concede it is the political issues that are commanding attention. </p> <p>Knutzen says: 'Europe has a history of war, both military and economic. The euro is an answer to the economic warfare of competitive devaluation and so on. It is an attempt to harmonise economic activity and economic growth.' </p> <p>But opponents can use these arguments, too. </p> <p>Sceptical businessman Kresten Bjerre, who runs an internet service provider, says: 'When countries like Greece, France, Spain, Italy and Ireland get together, is it going to be stable? Who knows. I say wait and see.' </p> <p>Looking back on the campaign, Grundfos ruefully admits: 'The Nos have used dirty tricks, like the pensions issue.' </p> <p>The pro-euro Jensen puts it differently: 'Our arguments are difficult to make, because they sometimes do not seem logical - even though they are true. The Nos are on easier rhetorical ground. As they say, the Devil has all the best tunes.' </p> <p>Meanwhile, out on the streets, the Danes are dancing merrily while the music lasts. As we have learnt in the past two weeks, the British would enjoy such an opportunity too.</p>",
  "<p>An international game of pass the parcel is emerging this weekend about who or what is to blame for the high oil price and what action, if any, could make it fall. </p> <p>Fears about the high cost of oil and its downstream derivatives are driving a high-stakes game of geopolitics, involving the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the US presidential elections, and futures market traders in New York and London. Black gold is high on the agenda in Prague for worried leaders at the G7 summit of industrialised nations. </p> <p>In the US a combination of economic and political effects led to the unprecedented release of oil reserves by President Bill Clinton. </p> <p>The wild card in the pack is this week's Opec heads of state meeting in Caracas - only the second such gathering in the organisation's history. The timing could not be better, coming as the cartel thrusts itself back on to the world stage from the brink of irrelevance, and in the immediate wake of the US's intervention. </p> <p>So what can make oil cheaper? Not surprisingly, it depends who you ask: it's Opec or it's extra refining capacity; it's a matter of using strategic reserves, or a question of rectifying the irrational exuberance of futures markets. </p> <p>In Prague the heads of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are fret ting at the prospect of oil shaving fractions of percentage points off world growth, and boosting inflation. The double-headed hydra of high oil prices affecting economies in the long term and voters in the short term was largely unforeseen. The French government is using the G7 meeting to propose an informal summit between the European Union, the US and the oil-producing countries. </p> <p>In the US, oil has become a political issue because of the high prices and because the Republican presidential running mates, George W Bush and Dick Cheney, have strong connections with 'Big Oil'. It was Al Gore, the Democrat candidate, who stirred the pot by getting Clinton to release some of the US's strategic reserve of 571 million barrels. </p> <p>Similar moves from the other G7 nations are now possible. In emergencies a mechanism exists through the International Energy Agency, the energy market watchdog of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, to release portions of the agency's reserve of about 1.2bn barrels. This oil was last used in the Gulf War, and was on standby for millennium computer bug problems. </p> <p>IEA countries could decide to make a co-ordinated intervention to dampen down speculative hysteria. But the notion of high prices as an 'emergency' is unprecedented. For now, efforts are concentrated on the more traditional channels of polite diplomacy to secure a production increase from Opec. </p> <p>William Ramsay, deputy executive director of the IEA, said: 'Frankly, Opec have not shared their agenda with us, though one of the clearest reasons may be to celebrate 40 years of existence.' </p> <p>The world leaders in Prague may be worried, but the Opec guests in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, will be ebullient. The city has been given an extra lick of paint. In the run-up to the summit, a three-month cultural festival featuring Opec member states' work included Kuwaiti art exhibitions and demonstrations of Venezuelan basketry. The meeting is the high point of a process of Opec reconstruction, largely propelled by the feisty Venezuelan president, Hugo Chavez. </p> <p>He travelled around the Middle East to deliver personal invitations to the conference, promising to visit Saddam Hussein even if he had to go to Iraq by camel or skateboard. Saddam and Libya's Colonel Gadaffi declined their invitations on security grounds, but the trip and the rhetoric surrounding it caught the eye of oil markets mindful of a possible return of the oil militancy of the mid-Seventies. </p> <p>However, Opec insiders say this should not be seen as a return to the sabre-rattling of that era. 'If Opec then could be considered a rebellious teenager,' its general secretary, Dr Rilwanu Lukman, said last week, 'I am happy to say that now, as its fortieth birthday nears, the organisation has gained the maturity that comes with age.' </p> <p>Opec will attempt to forge stronger links with other oil-producing nations, such as Mexico and Russia. Norway, which is a member of the IEA but has followed Opec output price trends in the past has sent an observer to Caracas. Senior analysts suggest Opec may achieve the spectacular diplomatic coup of admitting Russia to the cartel. </p> <p>If the heads of state really do want to make a difference beyond the diplomatic pomp and circumstance of the summit, they will find the scale and timing of any intervention in the market very difficult to judge. </p> <p>Opec members are notoriously bad at breaking quotas. It is also difficult to tell how other elements in the supply chain, from shipping costs and refining capacity to final demand for oil products, will play out. On top of this, oil markets - including Nymex in New York and London's International Petroleum exchange - are hard to read. Any production rise aimed at pushing the price into the band favoured by economists, Opec and consumers - between $22 and \u00a328 a barrel - is liable to cause a crash. </p> <p>'Opec has increased production this year much more than necessary,' Chavez told Venezuelans on TV last week. </p> <p>He said suggestions that Opec could increase production by 2.2 million barrels per day were exaggerated: the cartel was already producing in excess of world demand. Opec says the high price is not a result of a an oil shortage, but a lack of refinery capacity and futures market speculation. </p> <p>Refineries across the industrialised world are running flat out. Some have been doing so for months, and will have to shut for maintenance in October. If this is the bottleneck, increasing production of crude, or releasing reserves, may ease crude prices in the short term, but it is unlikely to cut the retail cost of petrol and heating oil. </p> <p>The IEA is not convinced. 'The numbers being put around - that Opec took 4 million barrels off the market, have put 3 million back in, and in the meantime demand has increased production by 2 million barrels - speak for themselves. I don't think you can explain the fragility in today's market by futures trading,' says Ramsay. </p> <p>The key to understanding where oil prices may be heading lies in the dark world of the futures markets. The oil market is distorted in such a way that it doesn't pay to store oil. Oil companies, refineries and speculators can make profits by running down their stocks and buying cheaper future supplies. This arises partly because of the uncertain intentions of the global oil market players, from Opec to governments and oil companies. </p> <p>The oil markets are, to use the jargon, 'backwardated'. This means speculators believe supply increases by Opec and changes in global demand will eventually come into balance, bringing the price of oil down from their present dizzy levels. As a result oil on the futures market is cheaper than the current or 'spot' price. </p> <p>If the Opec heads of state make any increase in production, it will have to be finely judged. Analysts believe that to bring the price down, any rise will have to be significant - more than a million barrels per day on top of the 800,000 rise announced earlier this month. </p> <p>However, such an increase is likely to produce a shock similar in scale to that following the March 1999 1.7 million cut, which triggered a massive oil price rise. But this time, of course, prices would slump. </p> <p>That would reverse the current 'backwardated' market, and create conditions of 'contango', where massive current supply puts the spot price below the futures price. </p> <p>Leo Drollas of the Centre for Global Energy Studies says: 'It is highly likely that we will reach contango soon: we will be awash with crude and the spot price will collapse. If I could say when that was I'd be in Monte Carlo. But I'd say it's likely in the first quarter of next year.' </p> <p>Robert Mabro, of the Oxford Institute for Energy studies, says: 'Unfortunately it seems that an oil shock is the only method of correcting these extreme prices, so you bounce back and forth from $10 to $33.' </p> <p>The likelihood of oil price ping-pong prevents Opec from making any production response that will have an impact on the market. </p> <p>In these conditions, a more likely cause of a significant fall in the price is smaller-than-expected demand caused by an exceptionally mild winter. A harsher winter, with everything else equal, will keep the market 'backwardated' and the price high. </p> <p>Industry analysts believe Clinton's intervention could backfire. Refineries will look for every means possible to sell crude from the reserve on the spot market and buy futures - undermining the effect of the reserve oil on product prices. Whether they succeed depends on the price at which the reserve is released, and how effective the US government is at policing abuse. </p> <p>'Refiners are clever,' said one analyst. 'They'll always find a way to beat the system.' </p> <p>There is also a risk that Opec might reverse some of the production increases in response to the unprecedented release of reserves. And then where would we be?</p>",
  "The backbench Labour MP does not wish to be named. He is nursing a majority around the 5,000 mark. His seat is in the South-east of England. It was won from the Tories at the last election. Two weeks ago he was confident of keeping his job and his \u00a345,000-a-year salary. Now he's not so sure. <p>Last week, as suddenly as the fuel crisis developed from small-scale blockades to full-blown national disaster, the nightmare scenario for the Labour Government emerged. Four opinion polls have suggested that the Conservatives could win the coming general election. Like so much spring snow, Tony Blair's 'impregnable' poll lead has evaporated from the political landscape. His personal ratings are down. He is blamed for the fact that the country almost ground to a halt two weeks ago. The Dome, pensions and a book by The Observer 's chief political commentator, Andrew Rawnsley, have come together to give this Government a bloody nose, cracked ribs and a black eye. </p> <p>Clare Short said last week that the Dome was 'a disaster'. Truckers said that Gordon Brown had to deliver on fuel tax cuts, or else. Barbara Castle said that it was time for action on pensions. And Rawnsley said the Chancellor had lied about the \u00a31 million party donation from Formula 1 racing millionaire Bernie Ecclestone. Blair himself, Rawnsley said, had slipped into mendacity. The Prime Minister has been silent. Now, this weekend, it is fight-back time. </p> <p>The next five days are vital for this Government. At their annual conference in Brighton, starting today, every one of the big Labour hitters will have their chance to reinvigorate support for the Government. They have been rattled. Suddenly the Tories are not such a laughing stock as before. </p> <p>'Whatever we say in public, of course we take notice of the opinion polls,' one Cabinet Minister said on Friday. 'There were those saying we had the next election in the bag. But I always thought the polls were underestimating the Tories' support. At least we now know where we stand. At least now we can concentrate political minds. The Tories can win.' </p> <p>For the backbencher, such a scenario was always possible. 'When you have a small majority, you know that you can lose, whatever the polls are saying,' he said. 'We had been lulled into a false sense of security.' </p> <p>Tony Blair's speech is on Tuesday. Senior Downing Street advisers say that he is going to map out 'the vision thing', something to throw the debate forward, to take this crisis-ridden Government away from the Dome and the fuel revolt and pensions, and set forth a new agenda - the improvement of schools, the health service, crime - on what this Government can do for you. It is critical. </p> <p>'We have to keep our nerve,' said John Prescott, Deputy Prime Minister and the man charged with ending the conference on a high with a tub-thumping 'trust us' speech on Thursday. </p> <p>'We need to be fully aware of what this Labour Government's done in carrying out its manifesto. [We need to] look forward to a second term. What this election is about is our justification to ask for a second term.' </p> <p>But future political seas look choppy. The Dome will not go away. Next month the National Audit Office report on the Greenwich attraction will be scathing about the financial mess. Many are predicting that Lord Falconer, the Minister in charge, will be forced to fall on his sword. </p> <p>Pensions will not go away. The conference will vote on the issue on Wednesday, and the Labour leadership is well aware it could be defeated. </p> <p>This week will also see the Danish referendum on entry to the euro with the No campaign leading in the polls. For the pro-euro Blair, a loss across the North Sea will only strengthen anti-euro campaigners here. </p> <p>And then there is Geoffrey Robinson, the former Paymaster-General, whose book, The Unconventional Minister , will for the first time detail his side of the \u00a3373,000 home loan he gave Peter Mandelson. It has already been bought for serialisation by the Daily Mail . Expect fireworks. </p> <p>Among all these icebergs, the Government has to keep some semblance of a straight line. Blair is arguing in Downing Street that his administration must not appear to be knocked off course by every passing disaster. They must try and rise above it all, but also appear to be listening and responding. It is a difficult trick to pull off. </p> <p>Prescott, speaking to The Observer last week, said that now, more than ever, it is imperative for the Government to define the clear dividing lines between Labour and the Conservatives - some tax and some spending versus less tax and, the Government argues, less spending. 'Yes, we have some problems. Everyone can see that we have issues which people are expressing strong concerns about; for example, pensions and fuel. We can show substantial evidence of where we have been listening and our solutions in logic and in application are fair, if you believe that those less well off should have the priority. You have to convince electorates and they have got to feel what you are saying is right.' </p> <p>He knows that the Government has a message to sell, but somehow it is not getting through. Does the tone have to change? Maybe, Prescott admits, a line also pushed by another member of the Cabinet who spoke to The Observer . What is clear is that you can't go on simply blaming the press. </p> <p>'It's for the Government to prepare its programme to convince an electorate that it's acting in its interests. If it's able to deliver in a confident way and has a good record of delivery - which this Government has without a doubt - keep your nerve, be proud of what we've done, but get out and tell them. </p> <p>'I am not a great one for polls, but I have noticed them. We've had unpopular polls - about transport two years ago and we dealt with the problem and we got the economy right and we put a huge amount of investment in and everybody said that's good. We did the same for hospitals and everybody said that's good and the polls tended to show it. We had unpopular polls in the spring and after the comprehensive spending review and the health expenditure and the transport expenditure; in the summer we improved and we showed that we were delivering.' He believes fortunes can change again. </p> <p>Matthew Taylor, the head of the well connected left-wing think-tank, the Institute of Public Policy Research, says that a little contrition wouldn't go amiss. 'Sometimes you have to eat humble pie,' said Taylor, who was assistant general secretary of the Labour Party before the last general election and was a senior member of the campaigns team. 'There needs to be a line drawn under the recent problems, some excitement needs to be created about new government initiatives. The debate needs to go forward.' </p> <p>Prescott, like so many politicians, cannot stomach the word 'sorry'. Keep apologising for everything and in the end nobody will trust you, he argues. 'Have you ever heard an editor [of a newspaper] apologise for getting something wrong? Blimey, if you adopted that principle when you got things wrong every paper would have the editor up every day apologising for what he had wrong.' He doesn't want the Government going down the same track. </p> <p>'Labour will lose the next election if it can't maintain the trust of the people,' he says. 'That will always be so. We must never be complacent, that is something the Prime Minister always says. Never take the electorate for granted.' </p> <p>Pollsters agree. Professor John Curtice, polling expert at Strathclyde University, says that the reason that the polls swung so swiftly against Blair (from a 20 per cent lead two months ago to a 4 per cent Tory lead last week) is because the Government committed the cardinal sin in the eyes of the people. The fuel crisis and Dome revealed a Government not in control of events. </p> <p>The last time there has been such a violent swing in the polls was at the time of the Falklands War, when Margaret Thatcher increased Tory support by 10 per cent. She was tough, in control. Blair appears to have vacillated on fuel and has remained silent on the Dome. </p> <p>But before Conservative Central Office starts hanging out the bunting, a word of caution. A careful reading of the performance of past governments in the opinion polls would offer Blair some comfort - and give William Hague a salutary warning. </p> <p>The over-riding point is that governments almost invariably gain ground as election day approaches. In the autumn of 1986, as last week, the Opposition held a narrow lead over the Government. Then, as now, a bald Opposition leader lagged in the personal popularity stakes behind a Prime Minister whose habit was to lead from the front. Then, as now, there was much talk of the governing party losing its landslide majority and facing a hung Parliament. And what happened? The following spring, the governing party - the Tories under Thatcher - returned to power with a 100-seat majority. </p> <p>Nor was that an isolated event. In nine of the past ten full Parliaments, the final six-to-nine months have seen a swing from Opposition to Government. What seems to happen with a fair degree of regularity is that some people who tell pollsters they yearn for a change when no election is imminent decide in the end that the incumbents aren't so awful after all. It even happened in the run-up to the 1997 general election. The Tories' 31 per cent on polling day was terrible enough - but it was significantly higher than their ratings throughout 1995 and 1996. </p> <p>So if history repeats itself, Labour ought to win an election next spring reasonably comfortably. What, though, if the polls next March show the race too close to call - say, Labour no more than five points ahead? It is at that point that Blair must decide whether to call a May election or wait until the autumn of next year or the following spring. Looking at what happened over the final 12-18 months of past Parliaments, the story is even more dramatic, with often huge Opposition leads either being cut back sharply or being overturned altogether. </p> <p>The Tories must face the fact that, even after moving into the lead for the first time in eight years, they remain the second most unpopular Opposition at this point in the political cycle in the 60-year history of polling. Only Labour in the autumn of 1982 stood lower . Yet suppose history does not repeat itself. What if the Tories stay narrowly ahead right through to polling day? Blair could still remain Prime Minister, for Britain's election system is now tilted in Labour's favour. If both Labour and Tories win the same number of votes, Labour is likely to have around 80 more MPs. To be sure of having more seats than Labour, the Conservatives need a 7 per cent lead in the popular vote. </p> <p>There are three main reasons for this: </p> <p>* Labour-dominated parts of Britain tend to have smaller constituencies than Tory-dominated areas. If constituencies in Wales and Scotland were the same size as in England, they would elect 23 fewer MPs; Labour would lose 19 of them. </p> <p>* Turnouts in strong Labour areas tend to be lower than in traditional Tory areas. Low turnouts in safe Labour seats drag down the party's national vote share by two-to-three points, but do not cost it any seats. </p> <p>* In 1997 tactical voting cost the Tories up to 35 seats. </p> <p>David Miliband, the unassuming but fiercely intelligent young head of Blair's policy unit, said two weeks ago he believed the first term in power had actually been all about proving Labour was a 'serious party of government', establishing its economic competence, airbrushing out the bad memories. </p> <p>'This Labour Government is establishing a new collective memory about what it means to be a New Labour Government. Gone is the winter of discontent: in its place a national minimum wage. </p> <p>He also highlighted a key New Labour problem, knee-jerkism, revealed in all its ridiculous glory earlier this year by the Prime Minister's sudden announcement that louts would be marched to cash machines to withdraw \u00a3100 to pay on-the-spot fines. Blair wanted to be seen doing something about crime. Two days later the idea was abandoned as unworkable. </p> <p>Miliband said: 'On every maths A-level paper it says please read the question carefully before you start to answer,' he warned. 'In the Government often the temptation is to rush in to give the policy answers before you really know what the question is.' </p> <p>Miliband argues that the key lesson he draws from Al Gore's presidential campaign in America is that the Centre-Left can succeed if it fights on the issues. Gore was behind Bush in the polls, started arguing about health and education, and is now ahead. </p> <p>'The lesson is that substance beats froth,' Miliband said. 'Essentially the Tories made a decision to attack us on a lot of trivial stuff, but when we produced the national plan [for health], the CSR [Comprehensive Spending Review], that won out.' </p> <p>Labour officials insist that the week's polls do not reveal some catastrophic shift in the social democratic consensus that was built to win the election in 1997.

  "First on the show was a man who could smash 31 wooden boards over his head in 30 seconds. Then came Susan Hawk, known to America as the bitch among the last four Survivors on TV who said she'd rather watch a rival die of thirst than help her. Then came the man who wants to be the next President of the United States. <p>This was the line-up for the downmarket Live with Regis chat show last Thursday night, starring George W. Bush in the kind of appearance that, more than ever, marks this presidential election campaign. Al Gore, meanwhile, has got himself into a wrangle over dirty jokes and both candidates have, of course, vied to impress Oprah Winfrey and David Letterman. </p> <p>Exactly 40 years ago on Tuesday, television transformed politics (and vice-versa) when the young, confident John F. Kennedy squared off against a haunted Richard Nixon in the first of the great presidential debates that have since been deemed the zenith of any campaign. </p> <p>Al Gore and George Bush will hold their contest six days after that anniversary, but the debates are nowhere near as important, nowadays, as moments such as those with Regis Philbin or Oprah. </p> <p>These appearances on puffball talk shows are called 'sight gags' - apparently vacuous guest spots that are actually big politics in disguise, aimed largely at the crucial women's vote. </p> <p>By all accounts, Bush had been genuinely nervous in the make-up room, staring like a schoolboy at photographs of Oprah with musicians and movie stars. On his own entrance, Al Gore had given her a high-five; 'Dubya' Bush had to go one better. He planted a kiss on her cheek. 'Why thank you,' she said. 'My pleasure,' he beamed. </p> <p>'Tell me about a time when you needed forgiveness', gushed Oprah 'Right Now!' chirped Bush. 'For real,' she pressed, 'Tell me a story'. Bush offered a few generalities. 'I'm looking for specifics!' teased Oprah. 'I know you are!' Bush giggled, 'but I'm running for President.' </p> <p>However, the American public soon knew that the candidate's favourite sandwich is peanut butter and jelly on white and that the one thing in life he couldn't manage without is jogging. This - not his speech on education earlier in the day - was hailed as the beginning of Bush's upturn in the polls. </p> <p>Gore had done the show the previous week, when Oprah had said she 'stayed away from politicians' because she never thought she could have an honest conversation with them. Al Gore disabused her (maybe) by confiding that Local Hero was his favourite movie and his favourite quote was by Bob Dylan: 'Those not busy being born are busy dying.' </p> <p>But chasing mass appeal can be risky. Gore got in trouble at New York's Radio City. </p> <p>It had to happen: 'Lick Bush and Dick' - a jokey slogan referring to Dubya and his running mate Dick Cheney. It first appeared on unauthorised T-shirts at the Democrat convention in Los Angeles and, more vividly, at a star-studded gala from the mouth of actor and artist John Leguizamo. 'I'm absolutely thrilled that Al Gore picked Joe Lieberman to be Vice-President', quipped Leguizamo, explaining that Gore is thereby 'operating under a very old, wise principle that New York women have known for years. That it takes a Jew to lick Bush.' </p> <p>Gore froze. Tipper rolled her eyes. Later, Lynne Cheney, wife to Bush's (goy) running mate, complained. But Rolling Stone 's Jan Wenner said that if Mrs Cheney 'thinks the concert was X-rated then she's someone from the frontier circa 1890'. Then Gore did his own shows. </p> <p>Within days, he was on Jay Leno being introduced as 'the man who invented cue cards' (a safer claim than the internet). Lieberman took the stage on the Conan O'Brien show to sing 'My Way'. Gore sidestepped Letterman's attempts to discuss serious matters, saying: 'Oh David, you're such a wonk' before reading out his top 10 favourite rejected campaign slogans, which included: 'We know when the mike is on'. </p> <p>Professor Todd Gitlin of New York University, whose forthcoming book deals with new relations between media and politics, said: 'Both the media and the politicians know that the audiences have fled the traditional news vehicles for Oprah, and they are seeking to catch them. To find eyeballs, politicians are forced to go where the performers are. </p> <p>'I have a certain sympathy with the politicians,' he adds. 'If the news vehicles now judge that serious politics is poor entertainment, and they cannot get attention with a speech about health reform, they must find the channels available to them'. </p> <p>If you play the mass appeal game, however, you have to get your facts right. Bush has muddled Greeks and Grecians, Slovenes and Slovaks, and when asked his favourite song by Oprah, he replied 'Wake Up Little Susie by Buddy Holly'. </p> <p>Only this time, unlike over the Grecians, he was at least able to correct himself. It was The Everly Brothers.</p>",
  "What is it about Slobodan Milosevic and twins? <p>Look carefully at the photographs of Milosevic supporters and it seems he has a particular appeal for identical twins who also like to dress exactly the same. A man in a crisp white shirt with a shock of white hair on the left of a Milosevic election rally; the same man with white hair on the right of the crowd. </p> <p>During an open air rally in one of his strongholds in Montenegro he had identical twins in the front row. A square-jawed man with grey hair and on the other side of the picture - his twin; a man with a moustache beside him and, on the other side of the picture, his twin, same moustache, same leather jacket. </p> <p>President Milosevic of Serbia, the 59-year-old leader of the former Yugoslavia and indicted war criminal, is on the ropes. After 13 years leading Serbia through four wars, in which ten of thousands of people died, and massive inflation, when it took a wad of banknotes as heavy as a brick to buy a pair of jeans, he could lose today's presidential election by as much as 300,000 votes. </p> <p>He is expected to lose despite widespread predictions that he will steal at least half a million votes in parts of the country where the opposition have no power, such as Kosovo and Montenegro. </p> <p>Whatever the outcome, the opposition have called people on to the streets of Belgrade at 9pm today to declare victory - insisting that, despite the expected fraud, they will have won a moral victory. </p> <p>Last week, as the election drew closer, Milosevic and his party began resorting to more desperate measure including sticking photographs together on the front of pro-Milosevic newspapers to make it look like he had more support at rallies. A Reuters journalist estimated that 15,000 turned out to see him at his last major rally on Wednesday - Milosevic claimed that there were more than 100,000. </p> <p>At a rally later that night in Novi Belgrade's new stadium, supporters were brought in from all over Serbia to boost numbers. </p> <p>There was 'election silence' in Belgrade yesterday. Tradition dictates that for 48 hours before every Yugoslav election the TV, radio and election pundits fall silent as the people ponder their future. </p> <p>When and if the opposition wins in Serbia, 40-year-old Mira Yovanovic will consider trying again for the baby she aborted two weeks ago. She is sitting in her 8th floor apartment and says that when the polls open she will be there to vote and then she will be on the streets. 'I really wanted that baby but we decided not to go through with it. It is impossible, the whole health system has collapsed. Even two weeks ago it didn't look like the opposition could win - now we can win if Milosevic goes. The first thing I will do, if I can, is make a new baby for a new Yugoslavia.' </p> <p>There is still strong support for Milosevic among the old who treasure their right to vote and will come out in their thousands in support of him. They are the Communist generation, trusting faithfully in the wisdom of state television. People like Zoran Pantic, 60, who lives in the town of Vrsac close to the Romania border. His blue budgie squawks continuously in the sitting room of a small ground-floor flat as he repeats the mantra of TV Serbia which has been controlled by Milosevic since 1989. 'The Americans want to make us their slave. Turn us into a colony. That's why they told Nato to bomb us. When will they stop oppressing us with sanctions. Milosevic is rebuilding our country but what can a man do in an empty kitchen.' </p> <p>Gordana Petrovic, a 35-year-old geologist, said: 'Our biggest fear is that even if we do win he will not allow our victory. I am afraid of the police but I will go out on to the streets and there will be hundreds of thousands of us all around the country. It is one last chance to get rid of him.' </p> <p>On Wednesday night the opposition managed to bring at least 150,000 people on to the streets of Belgrade in what was seen as a dry run for tomorrow night. </p> <p>'We think there is a strong possibility that he will put the police on the streets - but nobody is sure how he will react. We don't think it is possible for his police to control the hundreds of thousands of people that will come out all over the country,' said Ivan Kocis, a former airforce pilot who is working with the opposition to try and prevent election fraud. </p> <p>Milosevic has around 120,000 police at his disposal. 'The police force is the only employer in Serbia that is taking on new workers,' according to Jovan Dulovic, a Belgrade journalist who has specialised in police and military affairs for more than 20 years. 'All police leave has been cancelled for September. There is no sign of any mobilisation but they are ready to go with a couple of hours' notice. They will be brought in from outside Belgrade to control the people there. Local police are not used in their home town.' </p> <p>The police force also includes the Special Intervention Brigade, some 30,000 men, many of them former volunteers and paramilitaries in the Bosnia and Croatian wars. 'These are tough guys, athletes who do weights and the cream of the force as well as former paramilitaries.' </p> <p>On a grey, wet weekend in Belgrade, the coffee shops on Republica Square were half empty. A couple in Mirijevo were buying in beer and mineral water. 'I need only beer and fish - I have everything else in the house. Maybe we are paranoid but we want to be prepared.' </p> <p>In the election, a virtually unknown candidate, Vojislav Kostunica, a 56-year-old lawyer with 19 opposition parties behind him, could win by as little as 300,000 votes. </p> <p>Last time Serbia voted against Milosevic was in the winter of 1996. Then, he refused to accept the defeat of his party in the local election and the people marched against him for three months. At the height of the protests there were 300,000 people on the streets of Belgrade. They failed when a fractured opposition did a deal and went into government. This time no deals are possible. </p> <p>The opposition is also better prepared to fight election fraud. 'This time we are organising for our food and drinks to be brought in from outside, prepared by our members. In 1997 our people were in the toilets for two hours with diarrhoea and couldn't see the ballot boxes being stuffed with votes for him,' says Kocis. </p> <p>'We will also be on the lookout for people buying votes at the gates of the polling stations. Last time people were being given deutschmarks and ballot papers that had already been marked for him. They would go inside and vote and then come back out and hand over their empty ballot paper.' </p> <p>Among the people carrying the water and food to the election polls and to the opposition workers will be Yovanovic. 'I joined the Communist party at 16 and left it at 17. I swore I'd never join another party in my life, but now I have to fight for my freedom.'</p>",
  "An email has arrived from Belgrade. 'We're all in election fever, hope and horror at the same time. Wish us luck!' <p>No amount of analysis, speculation and informed guesswork can sum up better the mood in Serbia. Today the country is at the crossroads; tomorrow blood may be running in the streets of Belgrade. Thousands could be cheering the fall of President Slobodan Milosevic, or Serbs will wake, resigned to four more years of isolation, sanctions and poverty. </p> <p>According to Braca Grubacic, one of Belgrade's sharpest political analysts, most Serbs believe the elections are 'most likely the last chance for a peaceful replacement of the government, which could put Serbia back on a normal track and help it join the international community'. </p> <p>Grubacic says that if Milosevic wins the presidential elections - by fair means or foul - 'most ordinary Serbs believe the future of Serbia will be like Cuba's. Serbia will be a dead country waiting for the natural death of its dictator, and living the slow life of a tourist haven out of season'. </p> <p>The extraordinary thing about the polls is that no one has any clear idea what will happen. What is likely, though, is that as results come in tonight Serbia will be plunged into political crisis - or worse. </p> <p>Judging by the opinion polls, Milosevic, once dubbed the Butcher of the Balkans, is political history. But the polls may be unreliable and, more to the point, Milosevic has no intention of relinquishing power. Still, it seems extremely unlikely that he can win outright victory, which would require more than 50 per cent of the ballots cast, or at least 2.5 million votes. </p> <p>Zarko Korac, leader of one of the 18 parties now united behind opposition candidate Vojislav Kostunica, says: 'They [meaning Milosevic's Socialists and his wife Mira Markovic's Yugoslav United Left party] are in trouble. The question is, can they steal enough votes in an acceptable way? We don't think so.' Yet huge dangers loom, says Korac, a psychology professor at Belgrade University. As the results come in, he along with all the other opposition leaders will gather at their headquarters building. </p> <p>While opposition leaders will be indoors, they want their supporters to be outside. In Belgrade and several other big cities, giant screens will be set up by the opposition. From their point of view, the more people who are on the streets, the better. They are convinced that Milosevic intends to declare victory in the first round, to avoid a second round in two weeks, if he fails the 50 per cent hurdle. </p> <p>If then there are enough people on the streets, Milosevic may not want to risk a major clash, pitting police against vast crowds. At this point there is a real risk of bloodshed. If the situation spirals out of control, the army, led by General Nebojsa Pavkovic, may declare that the opposition leaders have attempted to launch a coup d'\u00e9tat, and arrest them. If however, it is raining heavily, too few people are out, or there is confusion about the results, any protests may quickly fizzle out. </p> <p>Although the opposition do look set to do well, there are, of course, many who still believe in Milosevic. In control of all the main media outlets, the President will have convinced many that the election is really a referendum between himself and Nato. A sign that Milosevic is worried, however, is his language. Over the last few years it has been somewhat restrained, perhaps an attempt to clothe himself in presidential dignity. Not any more. At a rally last Wednesday, Milosevic roared that the opposition leaders were a menagerie of 'rabbits, dogs and hyenas' whose one and only wish was to make 'a coiffed poodle out of their giant nation, by which the foreign master, when bored, can be entertained'. </p> <p>So everything now hangs not just on the vote, but on the reactions of hundreds of thousands of ordinary Serbs tonight and tomorrow. What happens if the regime and the opposition both claim victory? What happens if there are disputes over the way the votes are being counted? Nobody knows. </p> <p>All we know for certain is that tonight, Serbia is on the edge of the abyss. </p> <p>Tim Judah is the author of 'The Serbs: History, Myth and the Destruction of Yugoslavia'</p>",
  "<p>A truly curious letter appeared in the New York Times two years ago headed, 'It's time to repay America', by one Tony Blair. In it, he thanked Bill Clinton and the whole of the US for introducing him to the pleasures of governing the American Way. That, he wrote, meant 'results, not theology... free from preconceptions and bureaucratic wrangling... Government should not hinder the logic of the market!' </p> <p>As an American, I should have been flattered, but this outburst of affection was a wee bit embarrassing, like getting a Valentine dipped in perfume from an office mate. </p> <p>And I suspected that, as the poets say, beneath the greatest love is a hurricane of hate. So what so bugs Tony that he would write this billet-doux to 270 million foreigners? The PM's acrid reaction to the petrol revolt gives a glimpse of his dark secret: in his heart, Tony Blair hates Britain. </p> <p>This Prime Minister despises his storybook countryside and its grumbling farmers with their two little pigs and their tiny fields edged with dry stone. He cringes at the little bell ringing over the door of the village post office - so quaint and so maddeningly inefficient. He cannot fathom a nation that weeps over How Green was my Valley and moans when he shuts those filthy coal pits. </p> <p>He is frustrated to tears by fossilised trade unions which chain workers to dead industries, rather than building new ones, and by the rabid blue-hairs who demand he keep the Queen's nose on the coinage. Blair dreams of birthing the Entrepreneurial State. Instead, he finds himself caretaker of a museum of nineteenth-century glories made somnolent by easy welfare and low ambitions. </p> <p>Blair gazes across the water with almost erotic envy at Bill Clinton, chairman of the board of America Inc. This week, the once-arrogant now-jittery New Labour faithful creep towards their Brighton party conference to seek reassurance from above. It is important to understand how Blair's pathological imitation of Clinton is, in fact, pathetically off the mark. In misunderstanding the source of Clinton's - and now Gore's - political magic, Blair jeopardises his party's majority, and his nation's industry. </p> <p>Blair looks for the secrets to Clinton's economic and political success in all the wrong places. This struck me forcefully last week when I found myself in possession of a World Bank document so confidential even the bank's board has yet to see it: the latest Country Policy and Institutional Assessment, its internal 'school report' for less developed countries. The Bank rates each nation from one to six for their adherence to the neo-liberal ideals of the Bank, the International Monetary Fund and allied agencies. </p> <p>Bolivia, which deployed tanks and tear gas to quell a public revolt over water price hikes, gets an admirable two and a pat on the head. But Haiti, which is resisting demands to sell off its national infrastructure, gets a dunce's six, and is sent to bed without supper or access to capital markets. </p> <p>Highest marks go to nations committed to the five horsemen of the Washington Consensus: privatisation of public services, budget austerity, trade liberalisation, deregulation of industry, and labour market 'flexibility'. </p> <p>One gets the impression that Blair wants to be teachers' pet, to score straight ones in these tests, and bring back from Washington the Promethean fire that will transform Britain's socio-economic soul and drag it, kicking and screaming, into the third millennium. </p> <p>US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers told a London audience last December: 'With a flexible labour force, you too can replicate America's prosperity!' The Prime Minister bit his lip with jealousy. By 'flexibility', Summers means what the World Bank calls 'non-wage employment costs' - from working week limitations to pension guarantees - which hinder businesses' ability to use employees as they would any other commodity. </p> <p>Blair doesn't understand that Summers' 'flexible labour force' prescription is a con. In 1993, I ran into David Lipton, then Summers' deputy, at a party celebrating Clinton's signing of a new maternity leave law. Lipton had just returned from Eastern Europe, where he had told Poland's President to end maternity leave benefits. </p> <p>Did he note any hypocrisy? He was puzzled. Flexible (read 'unprotected') employment is for them - for the Polands and Bolivias - to serve our interests. It could not possibly apply to the US. If Blair were savvy, he'd note that while Clinton's minions sell modernisation snake oil through World Bank assessments and Third Way seminars, the President sells American voters protection from the risks of the new economy. </p> <p>Clinton - and his heir apparent, Al Gore - are proud to stand as bulwarks against the privatisation of the US social security system. They campaign on commitments to spend trillions on investment in public services, rather than cutting taxes, and they crow over new controls on employment and new restrictions on 'big tobacco, big drug companies and big polluters', to use Gore's phrase. </p> <p>By contrast Blair, in his snarling response to the petrol tax protesters, showed his commitment to 'the logic of the marketplace'. How unClintonesque. </p> <p>Blair should have noted how, during the November uprising in Seattle, even when ruckus-makers vandalised the President's favourite eatery, McDonald's, Clinton resisted the urge to go into Blairish scold mode. He praised the honourable intentions of the protesters, felt their pain and, to the horror of the UK contingent, effectively ended the World Trade Organisation meeting. </p> <p>Clinton is not above abusing Blair's naive desire to boost US corporate interests. For example, internal US Department of Commerce memos state that in 1997, Clinton's commerce secretary, William Daley, leaned on Margaret Beckett, Blair's first Trade and Industry Secretary, to grant US energy companies waivers to Labour's moratorium on building new gas-fired power plants. Daley's notes say Blair overruled Beckett and 'watered down the moratorium' to help US investors. </p> <p>This effectively sealed the fate of Britain's coal mines (and, I note, left the nation with no alternative energy source to counterbalance the current oil price rise). Given such consequences, why did he hop like a bunny to Clinton's bidding? </p> <p>For the answer, we must step back for a wider view. The US power companies that cashed in on Blair's policy exemption were merely the first of a battalion of adventuring American operators that wiped their feet on the golden doormat at Number 10. </p> <p>Wal-Mart swallowed Asda after its executives held an extraordinary closed meeting with the PM himself. Special privileges were extended to Wackenhut, the private prisons corporation, to Columbia private hospitals, to Monsanto, and to GTech, the bribe-tainted lottery operator. And today, the Government is hoping to lure in Edison, the schools privatisation company. </p> <p>Yet in the US, these companies are not fondly treated. Blair seems unaware that Edison is withering under Gore's attacks on privatisation. The Clinton administration has ground down Columbia with investigations and new regulations. Wackenhut has yet to recover from criminal investigations. No matter: to Blair they are a thrusting American stud pool which will breed with the mangy local stock. If the Wal-Mart dragon torches the high street, that too serves the higher purpose of economic Darwinism. </p> <p>Clinton is a class warrior. His commerce department's calls to Beckett indicate that, when push comes to shove, he will do the bidding of corporate America. Gore blasts the drug companies in paid political adverts, then plays their poodle to yap at African nations that dare to demand cheap Aids drugs. </p> <p>Gore, but not Blair, has learnt from Clinton how to play it both ways: working class hero and Wall Street's friend. Clinton's not bothered by cumbersome convictions or hifalutin theories. </p> <p>But Blair is a believer. He has none of Clinton's cynical cool. The PM has been wrongly tagged a philosophically empty bionic election machine, a box of poll-driven gears with a smile painted on the front. In fact, Blair may be the most idealistic, principled leader in the non-Moslem world, committed fanatically to the transformation of his nation's socio-economic soul. And that's frightening. </p> <p>But Britain is not Bolivia - yet. Blair cannot understand that the Washington jabber about flexible workforces and globalisation is a gloss for the projection of American commercial powers and privileges. Its aim is to make weaker nations' assets and labour accessible, cheap and compliant to US investors. </p> <p>Yet Blair sincerely believes that if he turns over Britain's high streets to Wal-Mart, its fields to Monsanto and its schools to Edison, they will sprinkle American commercial know-how over his laggardly island and - presto! - enterprise will take off. </p> <p>How profitable for American and local capital. And how sad to see the PM's affections abused. Only in electoral defeat will he realise that, as they say in Arkansas, he's been kissed, but he ain't been loved. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:Gregory.palast@theguardian.com\">Gregory.palast@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "France votes today in an important constitutional referendum - or at least it has been urged to. All opinion polls point to a woeful turnout, with as many as 64 per cent of voters staying at home. Fewer than a quarter of the country's under-25s are expected to bother to go to the polls. <p>Indeed the most gripping question for political pundits is whether the abstention rate will exceed the 62 per cent achieved in the 1988 French referendum over the future of New Caledonia, a distant land about which the French knew little and cared less. </p> <p>That most insulting of political gestures, the Gallic shrug, is poised to be given to a reform for which the country's leading politicians, including President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, have campaigned - if rather half-heartedly. They have called for an overwhelming yes vote for the reduction of the presidential term from seven to five years in order to bring the Elys\u00e9e into line with the prime ministerial term, and to end so-called 'cohabitations' between prime ministers and presidents of opposing parties that effectively block major reforms. A yes vote is all but certain. </p> <p>A low turnout may not be disastrous for either man but, given both are likely to stand in the 2002 presidential election, a demonstration of national apathy would be embarrassing. </p> <p>French faith in their lead ers is already taking a battering. Jospin's opinion poll ratings this month have been in vertiginous free fall - some showing a drop of 20 per cent - because of his perceived political ineptitude over fuel prices, blockades, taxes and the Corsican crisis. </p> <p>And Chirac would win no popularity contests either after last week's revelations, dramatically issued in a posthumous video testimony by a former aide, accusing the president of masterminding a multimillion pound slush fund in the 1980s. </p> <p>Ever since evidence came out of a secret telephone tapping service run from the Elys\u00e9e Palace under Mitterand to monitor journalists and political opponents, many of France's most powerful politicians have been suspected of involvement in political corruption without being charged. </p> <p>Certainly, voting in a referendum whose political ramifications may not become clear for decades is unlikely to change this. 'The referendum seems too constitutional, too political, too far from the daily preoccupations of the French to arouse their passions,' said Robert Schneider of the weekly Le Nouvel Observateur . </p> <p>Yesterday's leader in the left-wing daily Lib\u00e9ration was more caustic: 'You must vote. You have only 10 minutes to give up - this, the ultimate argument offered by Jacques Chirac to encourage citizens to act as citizens, merits inclusion in an anthology of political off-handedness.' If that was the best reason to vote, why bother?</p>"
