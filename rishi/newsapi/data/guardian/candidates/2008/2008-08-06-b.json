  "<p>Mauritanian army officers staged a coup yesterday, seizing the elected president of the north-west African country and ending a brief experiment in democracy.</p> <p>Troops were reported to be holding Sidi Mohamed Ould Cheikh Abdallahi, who was elected in a free and fair contest last year, after he announced the dismissal of senior members of the armed forces.</p> <p>The first signs of a coup came as state radio and TV went off the air amid reports of unusual troop movements in the capital, Nouakchott. Then the military rounded up the president and prime minister, apparently without using force.</p> <p>Mauritania, largely desert and twice the size of France, has a population of more than three million. It is an Islamic republic, the westernmost member of the 22-strong Arab League and one of the world's poorest countries. It is an ally of the US in its \"war on terror,\" has suffered al-Qaida attacks and also has diplomatic relations with Israel. </p> <p>The former French colony, Africa's newest oil-producing nation, has experienced several coups since independence in 1960. Last March Abdallahi replaced a military junta that had ruled since toppling an earlier president, Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya, in a bloodless coup in 2005. Taya seized power in 1984.</p> <p>But a crisis began this year when the president sacked the government amid protests over soaring food prices. The cabinet that replaced it has been dogged by instability.</p> <p>Mauritania faces pressure from international human rights groups to eliminate slavery, which was outlawed in 1981. Amnesty International says there is evidence the practice exists in the country.</p> <p>Racial tensions lurk behind many political issues, with black Mauritanians complaining of discrimination under a system that has favoured the white Moorish elite who have traditionally held power.</p>",
  "<p>Fatigue with Barack Obama is setting in among the US public after his trip to the Middle East and Europe received huge media exposure, according to a poll published yesterday by the respected Washington-based Pew organisation.</p> <p>Pew found 48% of those questioned said they had been hearing too much about the Democratic presidential candidate recently. Only 28% said they felt they had been hearing too much about his Republican rival, John McCain.</p> <p>There were signs that the exposure was eroding favourable views of him among some voters, and that negative ads by McCain were also having an impact.</p> <p>Obama is due to go on holiday in Hawaii, where he grew up, next week, but there will be no let-up in the intensity of the campaign. Obama's team is to spend $5m (\u00a32.5m) to buy up primetime advertising slots during the Olympics opening ceremony and the events likely to attract the highest US audiences.</p> <p>McCain, who closed on Obama in polls over the last fortnight, is to outspend him on Olympics coverage, having bought $6m in advertising space in 11 states regarded as the election battlegrounds, including Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida.</p> <p>The Pew poll found Obama continues to attract much more media attention than McCain. About 76% of those questioned named Obama as the candidate they had heard most about over the last week compared with only 11% for McCain.</p> <p>The respondents also revealed that the spate of campaign ads are getting through, with six out of 10 having seen an advert in which McCain portrayed Obama as more interested in celebrity than policy, focusing on the 200,000 people who turned out to see him in Berlin last month, and bracketing him alongside Britney Spears and Paris Hilton.</p>",
  "<p>President Pervez Musharraf decided last night to attend the opening ceremony of the Olympic games in Beijing, but not without some trepidation at leaving the country. The newspaper Dawn reported that the leaders of the two biggest parties in Pakistan's ruling coalition were coming close to an agreement on a course that would lead to his ousting or to his impeachment, and for a while it looked as if the trip was off.</p> <p>Mr Musharraf and Nawaz Sharif, one of the two leaders involved in the impeachment move, have a history of toppling each other. The president has only to think back to October 12 1999, when Mr Sharif, then prime minister, dismissed General Musharraf as head of the army while he was out of the country. What followed Mr Musharraf's dramatic landing at Karachi airport, when he got the army to unblock the runway as his plane was running out of fuel, was a military coup. What could happen now may not be that different, and both men may be motivated by revenge - Mr Musharraf for the drubbing he received in the elections in February, and Mr Sharif for 1999.</p> <p>This is a country where vendettas are played out against a wider security landscape. For all the euphoria that followed the crushing defeat of parties loyal to the president in February, the coalition government of Yousuf Gilani, the prime minister, has run into the sands. Food prices are soaring, a war with militants is raging, relations with India have plunged (again) and the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) spy agency, accused by Afghanistan and India of helping the Taliban bomb the Indian embassy in Kabul, appears a law unto itself. </p> <p>After just six weeks in office, the coalition between the Pakistan Peoples party and Mr Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League (N) all but collapsed over the issue of how to reinstate the judges sacked by Mr Musharraf. The fate of the sacked justices is linked inextricably to the president's, because it was the supreme court's determination to pursue the circumstances of the president's re-election last year that led to the court's dismissal. </p> <p>If the PPP and PML-N heal their rift over the reinstatement of the judges, Mr Musharraf may yet face his nemesis. But the country is weaker than it was to cope with the consequences of domestic crisis. There are many unknowns. Will the army take sides? Will the president's supporters engage the services of the ISI, whose cause they have been championing in parliament? Mr Musharraf said he would not use presidential powers to dismiss parliament, but there is all manner of proxy force available to those intent on destabilising democracy. Day by day, the self-serving argument that Pakistan can not function under civilian rule advances its cause.</p>",
  "<p>Robert Mugabe and Morgan Tsvangirai - rival claimants to power in Zimbabwe - are expected to hold direct talks on a power-sharing deal today, but crucial disagreements remain over how much authority the president will continue to wield. </p> <p>The negotiations are based on a proposal by South Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki, for Mugabe to remain as a titular president, with a guarantee that he will not be prosecuted for past crimes, while political power shifts to Tsvangirai as an executive prime minister because he won the last election acceptable as credible - the first round of voting for president in March.</p> <p>Mbeki is expected to travel to Harare in the coming days, but possibly as early as today, to press forward the deal. </p> <p>Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change broadly welcomed such an agreement when Mbeki first proposed it in June, provided that it established a transitional administration with a focus on writing a new constitution and holding fresh elections within two years. </p> <p>However, the MDC is hesitant to endorse a blanket amnesty for leaders of the ruling Zanu-PF who have overseen a bloody campaign of murder, abduction, rape and beatings against opposition supporters in recent months.</p> <p>Mbeki's aides have talked up the negotiations, suggesting that Mugabe also broadly agrees with the terms of the deal. But there remain serious doubts over whether Mugabe and the hardline Zanu-PF leaders around him who pursued their campaign to break support for the opposition in the June presidential run-off would give it all away at the negotiating table. </p> <p>Sources close to the talks say that Zanu-PF is insisting on Mugabe retaining many of his powers as president and on Tsvangirai, as prime minister, being forced to appoint a deputy prime minister from Zanu-PF. A likely candidate for the post is Emmerson Mnangagwa, the head of the Joint Operations Command who is widely regarded as an architect of the terror campaign against voters.</p> <p>A greater stake in government would not only permit senior Zanu-PF officials to maintain the considerable patronage they wield but offer protection from prosecution for their crimes, recent and distant. Mnangagwa, for instance, is not only vulnerable to prosecution over the state-orchestrated campaign against the MDC and its supporters but also as state security minister during the Matabeleland massacres of about 20,000 people by the army in the 1980s. </p> <p>Zanu-PF also wants a powersharing deal to be kept in place for five years, putting off elections that are likely to see the party devastated if there is a clean vote.</p> <p>Senior MDC officials suspect that Mugabe is trying to buy time in the hope that Tsvangirai will pull out of the talks and be blamed for their collapse.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama is about to go where he has rarely ventured during his gruelling, groundbreaking 19-month campaign: on holiday.</p> <p>The Democratic presidential hopeful is scheduled to begin a weeklong trip to Hawaii on Friday, taking his wife and daughters but leaving behind most of the huge entourage that shadows his every step.</p> <p>The holiday is a homecoming of sorts for Obama, who spent much of his early years in Hawaii. Attending the top-flight Punahou school in Honolulu, the future candidate was nicknamed Barry and known for his basketball skills.</p> <p>Obama also will get the chance to visit his Hawaii-based grandmother, Madelyn Dunham, whom he has not seen for more than a year. </p> <p>What he may pass up is a chance to be photographed. Obama took some flak from the media last year after a candid shot of him jogging in swim trunks made it into People magazine's Beach Babes lineup.</p> <p>This year, with John McCain often jabbing Obama as too much of \"a celebrity\" to lead effectively, the Democrat is likely to pass up even a flattering camera angle. </p> <p>Unflattering pictures can provide even more ammunition for political opponents. The photo of then-presidential nominee John Kerry awkwardly windsurfing during the summer of 2004 was the butt of jokes from chat show hosts as well as Republicans for weeks.</p> <p>Despite Obama's history in Hawaii, it is one of only two states \u2013 in addition to Alaska \u2013 where he has yet to campaign. In between the sun and fun of his vacation, then, Obama could be called to an event or two. There is a private campaign fundraiser scheduled at Honolulu's Halekulani hotel next week, according to the local Hawaiian media.</p>",
  "<p>The recent <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/01/world/asia/01pstan.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Pakistan%20Intelligence%20Service&amp;st=cse\">New York Times article</a> implicating elements of Pakistan's intelligence service, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Services_Intelligence\">ISI</a>, in the bombing of the Indian embassy in Kabul, is a public airing of American policymakers' longstanding differences with Pakistan.</p> <p>The Americans have become frustrated with a perceived reluctance among Pakistanis to attack militants in the country's volatile tribal areas, as well as a failure to rein in the ISI, which is accused of pursuing a foreign policy that is at odds with its own government.</p> <p>This diplomatic bombshell \u2013 which has gone further than any such assertion in the past \u2013 comes in the context of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/19/pakistan.afghanistan\">deteriorating security situation</a>, not only in Pakistan's tribal areas but in cities like Islamabad and districts like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swat_(Pakistan)\">Swat</a>. It has also coincided with an increasingly bold Taliban insurgency against Nato forces in Afghanistan, which has sparked talk of a new American troop \"surge\" endorsed by both Barack Obama and John McCain.</p> <p>But an increase in overwhelming force \u2013 which has already been tried by Pakistani president, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4797762.stm\">Pervez Musharraf</a> multiple times to no avail \u2013 is unlikely to work unless the US and its allies gain a better understanding the tribal areas in which they are so intimately engaged.</p> <p>Pakistan's tribal areas are populated mainly by <a href=\"http://www.sptimes.com/News/102801/Worldandnation/For_Pakistan_s_Pashtu.shtml\">Pashtuns</a>, an ethnic group that also extends into Afghanistan.</p> <p>Constant warfare in recent years has led many Pashtuns to believe they are fighting a tribal war to preserve their way of life. They feel threatened by the Pakistani government and military, composed mainly of urban ethnic Punjabis; the government in Afghanistan, composed mainly of Tajiks, Uzbeks, and Hazaras; as well as by the US. Although the Afghan president, <a href=\"http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/story.aspx?id=NEWEN20080060210&amp;ch=8/5/2008%207:46:00%20PM\">Hamid Karzai</a>, is a Pashtun he is perceived by many fellow tribesmen to have \"sold out\".</p> <p>Because the Pashtun tribes are Muslim, they feel Islam is under attack and seek to defend it. Clerics have even denied Islamic burial for Punjabi soldiers on the grounds that they are not Muslim.</p> <p>The larger war many Pashtun tribesmen are fighting to defend Islam against the perceived attacks of the US, the west, Hindu-dominated India, and the forces of globalisation, has its roots in this tribal micro-conflict and the one cannot be seen in isolation from the other. In this charged environment any apparent attack on Islam, be it from US drones or Danish cartoons, adds fuel to the fire.</p> <p>The ISI also counts many Pashtuns in its ranks \u2013 especially at its lower levels \u2013 for whom this tribal identity takes centre stage. The organisation has been structured since its founding in 1948 to fight Pakistan's traditional arch-rival, India. Many ISI operatives would sympathise with the Pashtun tribesmen who share their culture \u2013 which include actively opposing India for its policy in Kashmir, for example \u2013 regardless of the policies of their superiors in Islamabad.</p> <p>The US has suffered as a result of a confusing labelling of the enemy \u2013 the line between Pashtun tribesmen, Taliban, and al-Qaida remains dangerously ill-defined.</p> <p>To improve the situation, the US can take several immediate steps. First, it should work with the Pakistani government to reinstate the civil service in the tribal areas, which was removed by President Musharraf. This created a power vacuum which was filled by firebrand Taliban clerics.</p> <p>The US should also support gestures of dialogue with the tribes made by the new democratically-elected Pakistani civilian government instead of actively opposing them.</p> <p>This does not mean \"appeasing\" those that would attack America but administering more effectively. By combining the threat of force with efforts to gain the respect of the tribes by working within their cultural and religious framework, the US can swing the pendulum away from Taliban clerics who preach that Islam is under attack from the west. It can also put more American aid into education and development and away from unnecessary military expenditure which has cost the US more than $10bn since 9/11. </p> <p>This would also improve Pakistan's relationship with India by allowing the Pakistani government to continue its policy of engagement without the distraction of Pashtun tribesmen who wish to continue their fight. The calmer the situation becomes in the tribal areas, the calmer the situation will be in places that concern India, like Kashmir, and the less likely it will be that Pashtun elements in the ISI stir up trouble.</p> <p>If the US does not change course quickly, it will continue the global march toward disaster that has seen it get bogged down in other Muslim tribal societies such as Iraq and Somalia. Instead of going after only those in Pakistan's tribal areas who wished America harm, it has taken on the fierce Pashtun tribes which have successfully bled such empires as the British and Soviet. By implementing smart, effective, culturally sensitive policies, the US can avoid a similar fate.</p>",
  "<p>If you want the conservative blogosphere's take on John McCain, look no further than <a href=\"http://www.cafepress.com/redstate\">RedState's online store</a>. The conservative group-blog is hawking the usual right-wing guff: Obama: The Antichrist mugs and wistful Bush-Cheney '08 bumper stickers. But as of last week, they've extended their line. Now, they're also offering T-shirts emblazoned with the slogan: \"The enemy of my enemy is \u2026 McCain\".</p> <p>That's a pretty underwhelming endorsement, but at this point McCain will be grateful for anything he can get. The Arizona senator has faced an up-hill struggle to win over the GOP base. Few conservative bloggers have forgiven him his stand on campaign finance reform or his views on immigration, let alone his longstanding love affair with the liberal media. \"McCain has built his political fortune on kicking people right of centre in the teeth,\" <a href=\"http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=10908\">sighed</a> Karl at Protein Wisdom - so his backers shouldn't \"be surprised when conservatives, libertarians and classic liberals fail to swoon at McCain's success to date.\" Last year, when McCain's campaign was floundering, many right-wing bloggers cheered or jeered from the sidelines. As the senator staged a comeback, some bloggers did their best to disrupt his efforts. <a href=\"http://www.drudgereport.com/flashnyt.htm\">Matt Drudge</a>, the dean of right-wing cyberspace, even helped thwart McCain's efforts to kill off a New York Times story suggesting that the presidential hopeful had given \"special treatment\" - nudge, nudge - to a female lobbyist.</p> <p>Since winning the nomination, McCain has sought to charm the GOP's cyberchattering classes. So far, though, he's had little success. Conference calls with prominent bloggers fell flat when it emerged that progressive netizens had also been invited to join the calls. Other right-wingers cried foul when the McCain campaign asked supporters to <a href=\"http://www.johnmccain.com/ActionCenter/BlogInteract/BlogInteract.aspx\">copy and paste approved talking points</a> in the comment sections of high-profile blogs in exchange for \"points\" which could be exchanged for McCain-branded swag. Arch-conservative bloggress <a href=\"http://michellemalkin.com/2008/06/24/what-the-mccain-campaign-needs/\">Michelle Malkin</a>, who continues to savage the Arizona senator for his \"flip-flop-flipping\" on immigration and offshore oil drilling, mocked McCain's attempts to repackage himself for the Republican base: \"It's not fundamentally flawed messaging, it's a fundamentally flawed candidate,\" she wrote. \"The sooner Republicans reconcile themselves to that, the better.\"</p> <p>But while right-wing bloggers remain in no rush to embrace McCain qua McCain, most seem to be gradually coming around to the idea that he is, at least, not Barack Obama. That's led to an uneasy truce. While some die-hard conservatives are still kicking away at the GOP candidate - the online equivalent of voting for Bob Barr - the majority now seem happy to more or less ignore McCain and instead devote their time and energy to roughing up his Democratic opponent. Their shift in focus has been made easier, of course, by McCain's newfound relish for negative attacks, particularly in recent ads portraying Obama as a cross between Paris Hilton and Moses. \"Those were clearly the most effective commercials the McCain campaign has put out \u2014 ever,\" <a href=\"http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NjQ0M2VmNDRkZWIwMDlhZWQzMzBiMDY5YTk5MDJmOWI=\">writes Lisa Schiffren</a> at National Review's blog, the Corner. \"The celebrity one made a clever point. The 'The One' ad was brilliant ... As Richard Nixon, who thought a lot about these things, always said, politicians can recover from almost anything but being laughed at.\" </p> <p>Right-wing bloggers have also relished the task of rebutting suggestions in the liberal media that McCain's recent attacks were racially charged - and trumpeting the McCain camp's counter-claims that it was Obama himself who first played the race card. \"Needless to say, the Times defends Obama's 'dollar bills' line, which was the first injection of race into the campaign, on the risible ground that he was merely 'the victim' of a 'racial attack,'\" <a href=\"http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives2/2008/08/021156.php\">writes John at the PowerLine blog</a>. \"In the Times' world, you simply cannot criticise an African-American candidate, or you are a racist. Unless, of course, the African-American is a Republican.\"</p> <p>The upshot is that as you click through conservative cyberspace these days, you'll find that on many sites there's little more than a cursory mention of the GOP nominee. Instead, bloggers are spewing forth page after bile-spattered page of attacks on \"the One\". That's good news for McCain, who in his own right would struggle to earn more than a slow hand clap from the right-wing punditocracy. By defining the election as a referendum on Obama, he's been able to distract attention from his own record and keep the right-wing echo chamber focused on amplifying his attacks. </p> <p>The issue now is how far McCain can ride his \"enemy of my enemy\" shtick. Some bloggers have suggested that by helping McCain regain momentum, the conservative blogosphere could be paving the way for a new rift. \"Pretty soon the press will be turning against his trendy opponent and endorsing <em>him</em>. Then McCain will really be in trouble,\" <a href=\"http://pajamasmedia.com/rogerlsimon/2008/08/01/is-mccain-peaking-too-early/\">speculates PajamasMedia blogger Roger Simon</a>. \"If the New York Times backs him, he's sunk.\" That's not likely to happen anytime soon, of course, but there's a grain of truth to Simon's argument. McCain's tenuous truce with right-wing bloggers is likely to last only as long as the GOP nominee trails in the polls. The more confident conservatives are that McCain is heading for victory, the more willing they'll be to rock the boat along the way.</p>",
  "<p>This election was effectively over this July 4 \u2013 Independence Day, our national celebration of Not Being British. The backyard barbecue is the traditional rite performed this time of year, complete with watermelon, homemade ice cream, fresh corn on the cob and somebody's aunt's icebox cake. And hotdogs.</p> <p>All of those things were safely intact this Independence Day, but there were two indicators that the American public has already made up its mind about who will occupy the White House for the next four years. The first was the sheer number of such celebrations. Rocketing petrol prices have made casual trips to the beach or the lake less preferable to staying home and enjoying the backyard. Folks are having a hard time just budgeting out enough to get back and forth to work, much less weekend and holiday excursions.</p> <p>The second important indicator was <a href=\"http://www.lohud.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2008807020363\">what's on the grill</a>. Two years ago it was steaks and salmon, high-end cuts of meat that were well within the reach of the middle class. This year? Chicken, hamburgers and hotdogs. <em>Lots</em> of hotdogs.</p> <p>That's a warning sign. Now, I'm not running down hotdogs. Everyone likes a hotdog, from the basic ketchup-and-mustard to exotic regional variations (in the South, it's usually mustard, chili and slaw, for the record). American kids can live indefinitely off of hotdogs. But the number of them in your life is usually tied more to your income level than your culinary preference. They are the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/05/28/sales-of-spam-rise-as-con_n_103995.html\">meat-of-last-resort</a> to most families. When you can buy a pack of them along with buns, throw in a can of chili, and <em>still</em> pay less than a gallon of petrol, that tweaks the American psyche painfully.</p> <p>While hamburgers and hotdogs are as American as they can be (despite their Germanic roots), they are also the food of the working class \u2013 and the middle class, when times are hard. This year a lot of folks were choking down their third hotdog and dreaming of the T-bone steaks of yesteryear. To be eating a hotdog on July 4 \u2013 when you aren't a kid \u2013 is a sign of trouble. </p> <p>Thanks to a convenient calendar this year I attended four local barbecues within cheap driving distance and <em>everyone</em> had hotdogs ... and harsh criticism for the Republican party. </p> <p>I didn't indulge exclusively in liberal barbecues \u2013 my GI tract just can't take that much hummus. The Republican barbecues tend to have better beer and better meat, as well as traditional, easy-to-identify food with no lofty pretensions of vegetarianism. Even the vegetable dishes have meat in them. When it comes to politics and food, my head leans left but my stomach definitely leans right. But this year: hotdogs and cheap beer all over.</p> <p>Conversation topics at these affairs (after work, sport and gossip) ran steadily from the pump price of petrol to the war, the economy, the other war, the mortgage loan crisis and the election. I met only three people that weekend who were whole-heartedly supportive of John McCain. The rest of these southern white conservatives, once the backbone of the GOP's southern machine, were either reluctantly considering Barack Obama, thinking about backing the hopeless Libertarian party bid of former congressman Bob Barr in protest or opting out of politics this year altogether. </p> <p>It was a fascinating study \u2013 the subtle racism (and the not-so-subtle sort), the fear of a funny name, the \"inexperience\" meme were all a factor, but when it came down to it these once-proud foot soldiers of the Republican party were disgusted, defeated and disaffected by their own side. Once they canvassed neighbourhoods and raised money for the GOP. Now they were unconvinced that McCain shared their values and bitter about the mess the Bush administration has made of things. </p> <p>The evangelicals were disgusted with his lukewarm position on abortion (not to mention furious that in eight years, with a friendly legislature for most of them, Bush had not yet overturned Roe v Wade or stopped gay marriage). The fiscal conservatives were furious at the ruinous state of the economy and our massive foreign debt (though most had profited handily from the last several years), and while they favoured McCain on paper, they were unconvinced his nebulous economic policies were the right pill for the time. The more hawkish conservatives were pleased with McCain's support for the various wars, but were disgusted by his <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=4652517\">failure to back the new GI Bill</a>. Ideological conservatives \u2013 the darn-close-to-Libertarian crowd \u2013 had long ago jumped ship from the Republicans after the Fisa and Patriot Act issues.</p> <p>While grumbling, griping and complaining bitterly as they grilled their hotdogs, hamburgers and chicken, it seemed as if the final nail in the coffin of their dream of a permanent Republican majority had been set: news that arch-conservative <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/07/usa\">Jesse Helms</a>, longtime senator from North Carolina internationally famous for his right-wing principals, friendships with fascist dictators and his unapologetic resistance to Civil Rights laws, had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/04/usa\">finally died</a>. Helms was iconic to North Carolinians, a testament to stubborn adherence to tradition and values. You may have hated him or loved him, but when Helms died, an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/08/usa.race\">era ended for Republicans</a> in this state. </p> <p>For some, it heralded the coming tsunami of left-wing politics about to overwhelm them. For some, it meant that it might be OK \u2013 finally \u2013 to support a black man for elective office. And for some, it was just another reason to hate their own party and what it has become. Helms was a champion of the right wing, an adept politician who not only espoused conservative principals, but passed bills that had brought real prosperity back to his home state. He had dominated politics here for three decades. He was a true God-fearing conservative, no \"neo\" about him. Compared to Helms, McCain looks like Hillary Clinton. Helms's reign represented the high-water mark for conservatives in the south. Under Helms, the GOP was eating steak at the beach. Now they're grilling hotdogs at home.</p>",
  "<p>The president of Mauritania was today deposed in a coup led by the former chief of his official guard, who appointed himself the head of a junta ruling the west African nation.</p> <p>Troops seized Sidi Mohamed Ould Cheikh Abdallahi, who became Mauritania's first democratically elected leader last year, after he announced the dismissal of four generals, one of them the coup leader, General Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz.</p> <p>A brief announcement, read out on state television several hours after the president was detained, said Abdel Aziz would head a new \"state council\" to govern the former French colony, that recently became Africa's newest oil-producing nation.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.ami.mr/fr/defaultfr.htm\">copy of the announcement </a>on the state-run L'Agence Mauritienne d'Information website also said that this morning's decree by the \"former president\" sacking Abdel Aziz and the other generals had been annulled.</p> <p>Mauritania has suffered several coups since gaining independence at the end of 1960.</p> <p>The last one, in 2005 \u2013 also led by Abdel Aziz - toppled the long-serving president, Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya, who himself taken power in a coup in 1984. Abdallahi took power after the military regime allowed elections.</p> <p>Today's coup was swiftly condemned by both the African Union and EU, the latter group saying that it put a question mark over more than \u00a3120m of planned European aid for the country.</p> <p>The US state department also expressed its concern. \"This was a democratically elected, constitutional government and we condemn the act,\" Gonzalo Gallegos, a spokesman, told reporters.</p> <p>Today the new junta did not specify why they had ousted the president. According to some reports Abdallahi had angered elements in the military by opening talks with Islamist hardliners accused of having links with al-Qaida-affiliated groups.</p> <p>Last year, separate attacks blamed on Islamist militants targeted the Israeli embassy in Nouakchott and killed four French tourists.</p> <p>Today's coup appeared largely bloodless. Soldiers were sent out onto the streets of the capital and staff were ordered out of the state TV and radio stations but there were no reports of fighting.</p> <p>The president's daughter, Amal Mint Cheikh Abdallahi, told French radio that troops arrived at the presidential palace shortly before 9.30am local time (1030 BST).</p> <p>\"The president has just been arrested by a commando, who came to fetch him, arrested him here and took him away,\" she told RFI radio. \"This is a real coup d'etat.\"</p> <p>Mauritania has been in the throes of a political crisis in recent weeks. On Monday, almost 50 MPs quit the ruling party following a vote of no confidence in the government.</p> <p>The immediate catalyst for the coup appears to have been Abdallahi's decree today sacking Abdel Aziz and the three other generals. It was not clear, however, if the dismissals were themselves prompted by reports that the men were plotting to remove the president.</p> <p>Mauritania became Africa's newest oil-producing country after offshore fields began operating in 2006. </p> <p>The largely desert nation borders Algeria to the north and Mali and Senegal to the south and east.</p> <p>Despite hopes of prosperity from the country's still mainly unexploited reserves of oil and gas, it remains desperately poor and imports more than 70% of its food.</p> <p>It also faces pressure from international human rights groups to eliminate slavery, which they say remains widespread despite being outlawed in 1981. </p> <p>It was only last year that Mauritania's parliament voted through a law penalising slavery with jail terms of up to 10 years.

  "<p>John McCain has a novel idea. The crises of the world, from Darfur to democracy rollback, require urgent action the UN is incapable of delivering. So why not form a body of likeminded and democratic members with basically similar powers to those of the UN but minus the Belaruses and Burmas of the world?</p> <p>That is the logic behind McCain's <a href=\"http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/News/Speeches/Read.aspx?guid=43e821a2-ad70-495a-83b2-098638e67aeb\">League of Democracies</a>, which, aside from his support for the surge in Iraq, would provide the backbone of his foreign policy. \"It would be the one organisation where the world's democracies could come together to discuss problems and solutions on the basis of shared principles and a common vision of the future,\" according to McCain. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/03/26/819810.aspx\">plan</a> sounds peachy. After all, who isn't in favour of \"discussing solutions\" and finding \"a common vision\"? Such a league would ostensibly serve as a check against autocratic role models and UN obstructionists like China and Russia. It would restore American leadership in the world. And it would jumpstart democracy promotion as an ideal worth pursuing after the badly managed detour in Iraq.</p> <p>But the plan, hatched in the halls of neoconservative thinktanks, has Republicans divided. In his New York Times column last week, David Brooks called the league \"the best idea floating around\" for likeminded democracies to \"wield authority\" abroad. Yet <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2008/07/29/john-bolton-questions-mccains-foreign-policy-proposals/?mod=hpp_asia_blogs\">John Bolton</a>, who would prefer to see the UN sink into the East River, recently predicted that \"Ultimately [the league] will go nowhere.\"</p> <p>Bolton, like stopped clocks, is right once in awhile. After all, the league's creation rests on the fantastic notion that all democracies think alike or project their interests abroad in some uniform fashion. If so, then why were so many democracies against the Iraq war? And democracies, especially European ones fighting in Afghanistan under the Nato banner, often cannot even agree on rules of engagement during times of war. </p> <p>Plus, how can a body that excludes two of the world's fastest growing countries (and nuclear powers to boot), Russia and China, not to mention the entire Muslim world outside of Turkey and Indonesia, really have any legitimacy or moral authority? Wouldn't its creation just needlessly alienate these states or, worse, spur them to form their own bloc, a bad rerun of the cold war? </p> <p>The problem with ideas like the League of Democracies is they assume a world of good actors versus bad actors, a reductive view of foreign affairs. But the world, of course, is more complex than that. Non-democracies are often needed to resolve crises. Recall the useful pressure China put on North Korea to come clean on its nukes. </p> <p>Plus, as <a href=\"http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=20135\">Thomas Carothers of the Carnegie Endowment</a> points out, we've been down this road before. Think back to Clinton's 2000 Community of Democracies (never heard of it? You're not alone), whose touchy-feely mission statement echoes McCain's league. The group has done little to advance democracy abroad except to scold Burma in 2003 about its lack of elections. A lot of good that did.</p> <p>The truth of the matter is this so-called league would be perceived as nothing more than a rubberstamp shop with the same moral authority of President Bush's \"coalition of the willing\". And though McCain insists it will serve as a complement to similar international institutions, its promotion would only weaken the UN, which is just beginning to make small progress in places like Iran and Darfur.</p> <p>Like it or not, the UN still has the moral, legal and logistical capacity to sanction war and mobilise resources after major crises. (Disclosure: I occasionally consult for the UN's development agency.) Of course it is a flawed, anachronistic and even hypocritical institution (ie sticking Libya on its human rights panel) that needs reforming (ie expanding the security council). Plus every September the UN provides a forum for rogue leaders like <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/09/19/iran.un/index.html\">Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/sep/21/usa.venezuela\">Hugo Ch\u00e1vez</a> to thumb their nose at the American way of life before retreating to their five-star hotel up the block. But were major democracies to jump ship or curb their funding, the sidelining of the UN would wipe away a vital pillar of international affairs. </p> <p>McCain likes to trumpet his battle-tested fitness and foreign policy credentials as his chief advantages over his opponent. But his recent ideas abroad reflect those of someone who's snoozed through the last, say, 72 years of history, not those of a seasoned realist. On this issue, McCain is in a league of his own.</p>",
  "<p>A military jury today found Salim Ahmed Hamdan, the first al-Qaida suspect to be charged at the Guant\u00e1namo Bay prison camp, guilty of material support for terrorism but innocent of conspiracy charges.</p> <p>Hamdan, a 40-year-old Yemeni national who served as a driver for Osama bin Laden, faces life in prison after his conviction. Even if he had won acquittal on all counts, the US government had reserved the right to hold Hamdan indefinitely.</p> <p>The defendant clutched his face in his hands and wept as the verdict was read, according to reports from the courtroom.</p> <p>\"That the Hamdan trial \u2013 the first military commission trial with a guilty verdict since 9/11 \u2013 took several years of legal challenges to secure a conviction for material support for terrorism underscores the dangerous flaws in the [White House's] legal framework,\" Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama said in a statement on the case.</p> <p>The conviction brings the White House's fight to try terrorist suspects full circle. It was Hamdan whose challenge to the original Guant\u00e1namo tribunals prompted a 2006 US supreme court ruling that conspiracy - the charge that not did win a conviction - is not a war crime.</p> <p>Yet Hamdan's acquittal by the six-person jury of military officers could immunise the Bush White House from longstanding criticism that the prison-camp tribunals deprive defendants of basic legal rights.</p> <p>\"The fact that the jury did not find Hamdan guilty of all of the charges brought against him demonstrates that the jury weighed the evidence carefully,\" Republican presidential nominee John McCain said in response to the verdict.</p> <p>The tribunal allowed hearsay and inflammatory evidence, although judge Keith Allred, a US navy captain, blocked the admission of some Hamdan statements extracted through coercion. </p> <p>The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which sent observers to Hamdan's trial and provides legal support to Guant\u00e1namo detainees, blasted the verdict as a \"monumental debacle\".</p> <p>\"The judgment against Hamdan undoubtedly will be challenged in legitimate courts, but there is no appeal from the judgment of future generations,\" ACLU executive director Anthony Romero said in a statement.</p> <p>At one point near the conclusion of the 10-day trial, Allred admitted that he may have given unclear instructions to the jury on whether an \"enemy combatant\", as the Pentagon has designated Hamdan, can murder a uniformed soldier without violating the laws of war.</p> <p>Neither side moved for a mistrial based on Allred's instructions, despite the possibility that the murky definition could set a complicated precedent for future prosecutions at Guant\u00e1namo.</p> <p>Defence lawyers did not dispute during the trial that Hamdan provided assistance to bin Laden's network. Rather, they argued that Hamdan was a low-level player in the al-Qaida network, not the indispensable aide he was depicted as by Pentagon prosecutors.</p> <p>Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks who was recently arraigned at Guant\u00e1namo, weighed in on behalf of Hamdan. In written testimony, Mohammed dismissed Hamdan as a mere chauffeur \"not fit to plan or execute\".</p> <p>Hamdan's sentence is slated to be set at a separate hearing later today.</p>",
  "<p>Back in 2004, it wasn't just presidential platforms that voters were buzzing about. A sweeping number of conservative ballot initiatives that Karl Rovians hoped would draw conservative and evangelical voters to the polls also had pundits and pollsters chattering. You might remember the \"values voters\". They were the mythical independent voters wooed by those who hoped that values might be defined as discriminating against gay men and lesbians, immigrants and equal opportunity. And the Democrats <a href=\"http://prospect.org/cs/articles?article=weddingbell_blues\">fell down</a> on these ballot initiatives, panicked about pointing out the obvious discriminatory nature of the measures, hoping they would go away on their own.</p> <p>In the first flush of recriminations after the elections, values voters were blamed for John Kerry's loss. Democrats wrung their hands about gay marriage in Massachusetts having had a negative impact on their Election Day results, when what was really needed was a hard, introspective look at what these ballot initiatives meant for the Democratic party, and for America.</p> <p>Lately there's been little talk about these values, those voters and that kind of conservative election tactic. But the ballot initiatives? <a href=\"http://www.ballot.org/vertical/Sites/%7B26C6ABED-7A22-4B17-A84A-CB72F7D15E3F%7D/uploads/%7B7975768F-3116-4FBA-A32F-00D85059253E%7D.PDF\">They fester on</a> (pdf). Across the country, states are circulating petitions \u2013 and in some cases have already ensured the place of \u2013 a series of \u00fcber-conservative ballot questions that range from restricting abortion access to taking away rights from non-married (read: aimed at gay) couples to affirmative action.</p> <p>Start in Arizona, the presumptive Republican nominee John McCain's own state. Last week McCain reversed his earlier position on an anti-affirmative action ballot initiative \u2013 wolf-in-sheep's clothing like called the \"Arizona Civil Rights Initiative\" \u2013 telling ABC News' George Stephanopoulos <a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/07/mccain-reverses.html\">\"I support it\"</a>, even though just a few years ago he rejected a similarly worded measure as \"divisive\".</p> <p>Voters will be asked to agree with McCain on the following statement: \"The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, colour, ethnicity or national origin, in the operation of public employment, public education or public contracting.\" (Bankrolled by Ward Connelly, a similarly worded initiative will appear in Nebraska and Missouri).</p> <p>Arizona has some other fun ones currently circulating, including one that would ban the issuance of <a href=\"http://www.law.arizona.edu/news/Press/Silverman120707.pdf\">birth certificates</a> (pdf) to children born to undocumented workers. In that same vein, Oregon and Missouri have put English-only measures up for a vote. Oregon would ban the teaching of foreign languages in ESL courses for the next two years (meaning a forced English immersion to foreign students - a tactic that hasn't worked elsewhere). <a href=\"http://www.proenglish.org/states/missouri.htm\">Missouri</a> would ensure that no language other than English was spoken at public meetings regarding public legal issues.</p> <p>Harkening back to the battles of 2004, Arizona also has a Defence of Marriage Act (Doma) referred to the ballot. That anti-gay measure joins California's Doma, Florida's so-called \"super Doma\" and Arkansas' effort to prevent any non-married persons from adopting children. Each of these so-called marriage protecting amendments \u2013 sweeping measures structured by homophobia and the hopes of undermining the rights of gay men and lesbians \u2013 should be a concern to <em>all</em> Americans. If the mere discriminatory nature of these efforts \u2013 to strip domestic partnership benefits, adoption rights and other simple legal pleasures enjoyed by heterosexual partnerships \u2013 aren't enough to galvanise the general population to action, there are plenty of reasons unmarried heterosexuals might want to take notice as well.</p> <p>Ultimately, in their aggressive march to undermine the rights of fellow Americans, these measures end up discriminating against all unmarried people. When Ohio passed its anti-gay marriage amendment in 2004, the state inadvertently undermined the ability of unmarried individuals to sue for domestic abuse violations. If you weren't married, you weren't being battered. Surely that lesson alone should be enough to shake even those voters apathetic about gay rights. </p> <p>The perennial conservative effort to restrict abortion access continues through ballot initiatives as well. South Dakota - the state known for multiple attempts to single-handedly overturn Roe v Wade, including a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/19/AR2008071901586.html\">measure</a> that went into effect in mid July that requires doctors to tell prospective abortion candidates that the procedure \"will terminate the life of a whole, separate, unique living human being\" - will be voting on a ballot initiative that would ban all abortions except in cases of rape or incest. California has proposed a controversial <a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_PIMA.pdf\">parental notification law</a> (pdf) even though <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/06/national/06abortion.html\">studies</a> have shown that such laws have not measurably lowered abortion rates. (In fact, a 2006 New York Times study found that, counter-intuitively, sometimes it was parents that pushed for the abortion).</p> <p>Finally Colorado has a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/12/AR2008071201615.html\">\"definition of personhood\"</a> proposal on the ballot that would declare \"fertilisation\" as the moment that life begins. That means fertilised eggs will have the same rights as people \u2013 a definition that carries complications far beyond the abortion debate. The fertility industry, for one, often if not always, fertilises many more eggs than an infertile couple will implant in the hopes of childbearing. If Colorado has its way, those zygotes will have the same rights as people. The proposed law would also have an impact on the use of IUDs and the morning after pill (which prevent implantation rather than fertilisation), as well as some birth control pills. And it will potentially implicate a woman who miscarries or engages in any behaviour that might be deemed harmful (smoking or drinking or using drugs) while pregnant, an issue that has already become a hot issue <a href=\"http://www.advocatesforpregnantwomen.org\">in other states</a>.</p> <p>The big question for conservatives and liberals alike is what impact these initiatives will have on the race for the White House. Affirmative action, abortion and anti-gay measures can serve as <a href=\"http://www.rhrealitycheck.org/blog/2008/07/30/whats-coming-your-ballot-this-fall\">wedge issues</a>, painting a candidate in one direction or another, and thus woo a crucial several thousand votes. In 2006, stem cells did exactly that, in the tight Senate race between <a href=\"http://www.stateline.org/live/details/story?contentId=146780\">Claire McCaskill and Jim Talent in Missouri</a>, giving the margin of error to McCaskill, the Democrat. But all too often progressives are on the losing side the ballot initiative gamble.</p> <p>Currently, the conventional wisdom is the blowback from this year's ballot initiatives will be <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/njonline/no_20080725_2366.php\"> minimal</a> - but that dismissal comes with caveats. Engaging in debate sparked by these ideologically slanted ticket-fillers is a losing proposition for any candidate, embroiling them in dirty, overly specific, no-win battles fiercely defended by highly partisan splinter groups that can only damage the general reputation of the politician.</p> <p>For those ballot initiatives that are already set for November in swing states like Florida, Missouri and Colorado, the hope is that the sticky space will be <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-ballot29-2008jul29,0,845120.story\">shared by McCain</a> who will have to take politically impossible positions (the \"personhood\" measure, for one, has divided conservatives, and flip-flopping on affirmative action only hurts). But for those measures still in the petition stage, Democrats should work while they can to keep them from ever hitting the ballot, fighting them on their dubious constitutionality and their distasteful, and anti-American, discriminatory messages.</p>",
  "<p>So basically Barack Obama <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzZNP4tTfV0\">suggested</a> that a good way to save energy would be if Americans kept the tyres of their cars at the correct pressure which is <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1829354,00.html?cnn=yes\">essentially true</a> but Rush Limbaugh <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuCtpO-UB54\">thought</a> it was ridiculous and the McCain campaign mocked Obama by offering <a href=\"http://embeds.blogs.foxnews.com/2008/08/04/mccain-camp-mocks-obama-energy-plan/\">free tyre gauges</a> in return for campaign donations so Obama accused the Republicans of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akjXqfvLu28\">taking pride in being ignorant</a> but then McCain said actually he <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/jonathanmartin/0808/McCain_puts_tire_gauge_in_mouth.html\">agreed</a> with Obama's idea so then today Obama mocked McCain for disagreeing with his own campaign, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0808/Obama_takes_gauge_opportunity.html\">saying</a> \"In the coming days it's going to be interesting to watch this debate between John McCain and John McCain,\" and anyway it turns out that McCain <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/cenk-uygur/mccains-energy-plan-impro_b_117052.html\">advocated</a> similar small-but-effective measures in the past so really both sides agree with each other but that's not an acceptable state of affairs in political campaigning so now the McCain campaign won't be able to admit that Paris Hilton Paris Hilton Paris Hilton.</p>",
  "<p>The moment of truth is at hand for US biofuels this week as environmental regulators prepare to rule on one state's request to halve the steep national target for blending ethanol into fuel.</p> <p>Texas governor Rick Perry asked the US environmental protection agency (EPA) in April to cut the national biofuels target 50% from its current level of 9bn gallons. After an unexpected delay last month, the EPA is expected to rule on Perry's waiver request as soon as this week.</p> <p>The waiver proposal has stoked a fierce political row over the future of biofuels, with some US politicians echoing their European counterparts in questioning whether ethanol's effect on food prices limits its usefulness as an alternative to traditional fuel.</p> <p>\"We need to put an end to flawed government policies that distort the markets, raise food prices artificially, and pit producers against consumers,\" senator John McCain said in May after he and 23 fellow Republicans endorsed an easing of the ethanol target. </p> <p>Three major environmental groups have even sided with the conservative governor \u2013 albeit with different motives than Perry, who sought the waiver to protect Texas livestock producers from rising corn prices. </p> <p>Suspending the biofuels target would allow the EPA the environmental sustainability of increased ethanol production, according to Friends of the Earth energy policy campaigner Kate McMahon.</p> <p>\"This biofuels mandate essentially dictates inaction on climate change by taking us in a useless and potentially harmful direction,\" McMahon said in a statement last month.</p> <p>Yet powerful supporters of increased ethanol production hail from nearly every corn-producing state in the US, including an Illinois senator named Barack Obama. In his energy plan released this week, the Democratic presidential nominee sets a 60bn-gallon target within 22 years for advanced biofuels, including cellulosic ethanol.</p> <p>The ethanol industry's US trade group, the Renewable Fuels Association (RFA), asserts that the carbon footprint of ethanol \u2013 already lower than that of conventional petrol \u2013 will only decrease as the ethanol target encourages the development of advanced biofuel.</p> <p>\"We're doing everything we can, as efficiently as we can, to bring those technologies to the marketplace,\" RFA spokesman Matt Hartwig said. </p> <p>\"But if you go in and undermine the foundation of the ethanol industry today, you'll set back the development of those next-generation technologies.\"</p> <p>That more and more US corn is being diverted to make ethanol is not in dispute. The US agriculture department estimates that 25% of the nation's corn crop, valued at $52.1bn, was used for fuel last year. That number could rise as high as 35% this year.</p> <p>But the ethanol industry argues that high oil prices, not biofuels, are to blame for food prices that have risen far faster than inflation. </p> <p>Only one-quarter of recent US corn price increases are attributable to the ethanol tax credit \u2013 recently reduced by Congress from 51 cents to 45 cents per gallon \u2013 according to a Purdue University study commissioned by the Farm Foundation.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jul/03/biofuels.renewableenergy\">confidential World Bank report</a> obtained by the Guardian last month, however, tagged biofuels as the cause of a 75% rise in worldwide food prices.</p> <p>The EPA's delay in ruling on the Texas waiver request, which sparked more than 15,000 public comments to the agency, raised concerns among those on both sides of the biofuels battle. </p> <p>Eight senators from corn-producing states publicly warned EPA administrator Stephen Johnson against \"any agreements being made behind closed doors\". </p> <p>Meanwhile, some commodity watchers predicted that falling corn prices this summer would give the agency grounds to deny the waiver.</p> <p>No matter what the EPA decides in coming days, the battle may not end right away. Biofuels supporters are likely to challenge any potential waiver in court, and Perry appears to have laid the groundwork for a lawsuit against the agency if his request is denied.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://carboncontrolnews.com/\">Carbon Control News</a>, Perry wrote in comments to the EPA that the law requires a waiver of the ethanol target \"whenever [Johnson] is able to make a reasonable determination that a major sacrifice would flow from the implementation of the mandates\".</p>",
  "<p>Unfazed by Paris Hilton's <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/usa/2008/08/whats_that_youd_really_like_to.html\">fightback</a>, it looks like the McCain campaign's description of Barack Obama as \"the biggest celebrity in the world\" is going to become a standard line in their attack advertising.

Now somebody else is the celebrity.\"</p> <p>(Dowd, because she is Dowd, also compares McCain to Richard of Gloucester, and calls Obama 'the new It guy'.) There's a huge amount to be said for the argument that politics should be analysed from a psychological perspective far more than it usually is.

  "<p>Ever since Ehud Olmert announced his resignation, there has been speculation about what his status as an outgoing leader will mean for the peace process. Not very much, I suspect, as this lame duck prime minister has done little more than engage in politically expedient dead duck initiatives. </p> <p>Olmert \u2013 who can best be described as a scavenging hawk with a dovish song \u2013 lacks the vision, courage and ideological inclination to take the steps necessary to reach a workable resolution, despite the Annapolis platitudes and its 12-month deadline. </p> <p>At the time, I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/19/acivilsolution\">saw the gathering</a> as an \"elaborate way of reiterating the current status quo\". And so it is hardly surprising that some nine months on from Annapolis, the status quo remains unchanged. </p> <p>The only glimmer of hope is on the <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article4449488.ece\">Syrian front</a>, where both Olmert and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad are making strong peace overtures, but this could easily be derailed by the next elections, especially if <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2393677.stm\">Binyamin Netanyahu</a> takes over, or Syria fails to distance itself sufficiently from Tehran.</p> <p>In fact, the fractured and divided nature of the Israeli political landscape is one of the main obstacles to peace because it prevents the government taking the bold steps needed to achieve peace, and enables the hawks to take the doves hostage. </p> <p>Perhaps the most striking example of this uneven contest was the clash in perceptions between Israel's first and second prime ministers David Ben-Gurion (Israel's \"founding father\"), and Moshe Sharett. Although both were committed Zionists, Sharett was in favour of diplomacy and a negotiated settlement with the Arabs.</p> <p>Unlike Ben-Gurion, who knew little about Arab society and culture and distrusted Arabs intensely, Sharett was an accomplished Arabist and had many Arab friends. At a <a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Politics/Mapai.html\">Mapai party</a> meeting, he once declared: \"There is a wall between us and [the Arabs] \u2026 If this wall can be prevented from getting taller, it is a sacred duty to do so.\"</p> <p>Sharett's most spectacular attempt to dismantle the \"wall\" was the secret talks he initiated with the new Egyptian regime led by the revolutionary <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Officers_Movement\">Free Officers' Movement</a>. Despite his later anti-Israel reputation, Gamal Abdel Nasser saw, at the time, that compromise and accommodation were the only way to resolve the conflict.</p> <p>Before he became president, but as de facto leader of the revolution, Nasser assured Sharett, in a secret correspondence in May 1953, that Egypt harboured no belligerent feeling towards Israel and signalled his willingness to build bridges. </p> <p>Even the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavon_Affair\">Lavon Affair</a> in 1954 did not weaken his resolve. Nasser decided not to blame Sharett \u2013 who was in fact not aware of the plot \u2013 and agreed to resume the clandestine contacts. Between October 1954 and January 1955, the two men discussed indirectly Israeli-Egyptian relations, border issues, solutions to the Palestinian refugee crisis, Israeli shipping rights and avenues for economic co-operation.</p> <p>Nasser even agreed to high-level secret talks between Egyptian and Israeli diplomats, but Sharett got cold feet due to domestic anger surrounding the trial of the Israeli spies behind the Lavon terror campaign. </p> <p>Alarmed at Sharett's dovish overtures, Ben-Gurion came out of retirement and replaced him as prime minister again in 1955. Almost at once, Ben-Gurion launched a major raid on Gaza, sparking a downward spiral to war and effectively burying prospects for peace for almost a quarter of a century. </p> <p>Had Sharett succeeded and managed to translate his backroom talks into an actual peace that covered all the aspects he and Nasser discussed, the Middle East today could have been a very different place. But he lacked the popular appeal and charisma to counter the populism of his opponents.</p> <p>Militants getting the upper hand over moderates is not just an Israeli malaise. The Palestinians have also suffered their fair share of that. A Palestinian parallel of the Sharett-Ben-Gurion standoff was the confrontation between the mufti and mayor of Jerusalem.</p> <p>Haj Amin el-Husseini, the notorious mufti of Jerusalem, was a complete rejectionist of the Zionist presence in Palestine. While the Palestinians had the right to feel irked that the British had promised their land to another people without consulting them, a realist and humanist would've tried to find an accommodation that would allow Palestinians to realise their national aspirations and enable Jews to flee persecution, either by agreeing to a bi-national state or partition \u2013 both of which were on the cards. In fact, just before the outbreak of the second world war, the British offered the Palestinians a state with an Arab majority within a decade. He rejected that, too. </p> <p>Raghib el-Nashashibi, who was mayor Jerusalem between 1920 and 1934, opposed the unbending and uncompromising stance of Haj Amin. Nashashibi was in favour of a negotiated settlement with the British and the Zionists and, as head of the National Defence Party, he was willing to accept partition so long as the Palestinians got sufficient land and could merge with Transjordan to form a viable political entity.</p> <p>But the mufti, a master populist, managed both to get the upper hand against Nashashibi and other moderates, setting back the Palestinian quest for nationhood, and to tarnish the Palestinian struggle by moving to Europe and collaborating with the Nazis.</p> <p>Again, one cannot help but speculate how different reality would have been had moderates like Nashashibi gained the advantage during the British mandate and managed to find moderate Zionists with whom to reach an accommodation.</p> <p>In order to avoid total despair, it is important to realise that moderates may lose many battles, but they can eventually win the war. After all, a quarter of a century after the Sharett-Nasser talks, Egypt and Israel made peace.</p> <p>Likewise, trailblazers such as Israel's veteran peacenik Uri Avnery and moderate PLO members, such as the late Issam Sartawi, met together in the Israel-Palestine Peace Council in the mid-1970s to discuss a two-state resolution to the conflict. Said Hammami (whose name means pigeon or dove in Arabic), the PLO's London representative, was a vocal advocate of a two-state solution which, he believed, would eventually merge into a single, democratic, multi-ethnic state. Both Sartawi and Hammami paid for their convictions with their lives.</p> <p>Today, hope for the future does not lie with the mainstream players, but with the brave, principled and sensible advocates currently on the political fringe. On the Palestinian side, a strong candidate is Mustafa Barghouti, the founder of the Palestinian National Initiative and the runner-up in the last presidential election. On the Israeli side, there is Adam Keller, the spokesman of the peace group Gush Shalom.
