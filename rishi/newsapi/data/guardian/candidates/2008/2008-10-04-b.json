  "<p>I never imagined I would live through events like those of the past three weeks. The Western banking system faces disintegration. Economists and policy-makers are at loggerheads over how to intervene to stop the panic that is sweeping the world and inspire sufficient trust for the key money and credit markets to reopen.</p> <p>This is a crisis that has been 30 years in the making - a Gordian knot of libertarian free-market fundamentalism, unregulated globalisation, the collapse of social and political forces committed to fairness, the explosive impact of financial innovations such as 'securitisation', and sheer greed. Each has contributed to the fiasco - and all now need to be unravelled if the economy is to have a sustained recovery.</p> <p>In the Seventies, there was a revolution born of a free-market belief that inflation and low growth were the consequence of too much state action - too much public spending, too much taxation, too much union power and toomuch money being printed. Instead we would rely on what Ronald Reagan once called the 'magic of the market'. Governments should balance their books and let companies, banks and workers make their own decisions liberated by free markets. Thus stagflation would be bested.</p> <p>Some of this made sense. Nationalised industries were not especially well run, some highly unionised industries such as printing and cars suffered low productivity, and governments had become too addicted to running budget deficits. Challenging the shibboleths of the Seventies was long overdue, and over the Eighties it began to produce some results - lower inflation and more growth.</p> <p>And then the Berlin Wall fell, the Soviet Union collapsed, and the revolution hardened into something more dangerous - an ideological commitment to the view that government regulation had no place whatever in the economy. The left critique of capitalism - that markets delivered instability, booms and busts, monopoly and gross inequity that paradoxically undermined the values of integrity and trust that bind markets together - was proven wrong. Thereshould not even be a mixed economy between private and public sectors. The job was to enlarge the role of markets.</p> <p>In the United States this would manifest itself in Newt Gingrich's 'Contract with America' that gave free licence to the anti-tax, anti-government, pro-deregulation instincts of an increasingly fervent Republican party. That wasn't all. The financial markets were exploiting the new freedoms to insist that governments did Republican things. The Bush presidency sealed the market fundamentalists' victory.</p> <p>This was manna from heaven for the City of London, desperate to recover its place as the fulcrum on which the British economy pivoted. Ditching the gold standard in 1931 had dealt it a harsh blow. Controls directed cheap finance into industry throughout the Depression and into the war. The City hated it, but, by 1951, 20 years of 'proud finance being humbled', as Winston Churchill had put it, had prompted Britain's partial reindustrialisation.</p> <p>Despite its troubles, the City of London remained the apex of Britain's social structure throughout this period. This is to where the privately educated, Oxbridge professionals in law, accounting and banking commuted from their large Home Counties houses to practise 'gentlemanly capitalism' - a capitalism that does not focus on manufacture, science and technology, but on property, international lending, deals and the trading of financial securities. It provided a good living in the Fifties, Sixties and Seventies, but London had ambitions. North Sea oil created the balance of payments surpluses that would allow the incoming Tory government to lift controls. The way was open for London to combine with New York to become the centre of world finance. </p> <p>The regulations that inhibited London's development were progressively eliminated. 'Big Bang' in 1986 allowed the brokers and jobbers on London's stock market to be bought up by American, European and Japanese investment banks so they could do in London what was outlawed in New York by Roosevelt's Glass-Steagall Act, introduced in the aftermath of the credit crunch that caused the Great Depression. They could manage huge investment funds, trade in any kind of financial security both on their own account and for clients, advise on deals and act as large banks - all under the same roof despite the conflicts of interest that were prohibited in New York. London began to rise in the league tables of international finance. The foundations of Anglo-American financial capitalism were being laid - and with them the seeds of its own demise.</p> <p>In the early Nineties came a breakthrough that would transform the financial landscape. Goldman Sachs took the concept hitherto used by mortgage companies of packaging up mortgage payments and selling them as a financial security and applied it to an Arizona trailer park. The site pledged its income to a new company, specially set up, which then issued securities - backed by Goldman. The market bought them. 'Securitisation' took off: there are more than $8 trillion of securities backed by a weird and wonderful range of income streams. America, followed rapidly by Britain, did not have to worry that it did not save enough to support its borrowing ambitions; it could sell these securities to all comers from all over the world - especially in Asia and to China's central bank - to finance ambitions to borrow. </p> <p>And we did. Banks issued bonds allowing huge takeovers. Hedge funds and private equity companies blossomed. Money flowed into residential housing. In 1999, Bill Clinton abolished Glass-Steagall; it was pointless given what was happening in London. New York and London were in an unseemly race to regulate less. And if regulators raised an eyebrow they were told not to worry. The securitised bonds - this packaged income - could always be sold to raise cash; and on top banks took out insurance against the risk of default. </p> <p>Nor should regulators worry if banks directed the investment funds under their management to buy any unsold bonds which might look like a fraudulent conflict of interest; one day they would rise in value. </p> <p> So confident did bank directors become that they authorised their managers to run hidden portfolios of securitised assets offshore in secret tax havens; thus would profits be boosted at no risk. </p> <p>Bonuses grew larger and larger, residential and property prices kept rising, fees from ever-bigger deals became juicier and juicier. And when there were setbacks, such as the dot.com bubble bursting, chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan was on hand to flood the markets with cheap money. The free-market fundamentalists seemed to be right. Markets never did make mistakes, financial business kept booming, leverage became astronomical. The ever more extravagant school fees were easily paid and Britain's Home Counties - like New York and the Hamptons - became home to parties of astounding luxury and lifestyles of grotesque opulence. Gentlemanly capitalism became super-gentlemanly capitalism. The Financial Times' How to Spend it magazine is studded with dresses that cost up to \u00a330,000. Private submarines, jets and yachts became the rage. One hedge fund manager I knew considered himself underpaid at $200m for one year's work. </p> <p>There was no effective opposition. The left and organised labour collapsed as intellectual, social and political forces; there was no conviction that any alternative to this shareholder value-driven, financial, 'securitised' capitalism existed, or any political muscle to support it even if there were. Mainstream culture moved away from public purpose and fairness; the new priorities were individual self-fulfilment, personal experience and loyalty to self. For example, in the 1990s I fervently opposed the demutualisation of our building societies, built on the values of fairness and collective self-help, arguing that in the interests of pluralism alone we needed a variety of financial institutions to serve the public. They would inevitably try to expand too fast; and inevitably end up being taken over.</p> <p>So it has proved. Every demutualised building society has been taken over. But nobody wanted to listen. The directors wanted the vast personal gains and the members were only scarcely less greedy. In any case, building societies were collective institutions from another age rather like trade unions and no more worth defending. </p> <p>Investment bankers seemed cut from the same cloth as Russian oligarchs and football stars; their fantastic wealth was part of the new order - one that produced growth every year since 1992 and a never-ending rise in house prices. If the rich were getting very rich, ordinary people were not doing badly either. Britain had stumbled on a new social compact.</p> <p>Leader writers of right-wing newspapers could dub the high priests of finance 'wealth generators' without demur - and if any regulator tried to limit their operations, the world would fall on their head. When Tony Blair flirted with the stakeholder capitalism that I proposed in The State We're In for a few weeks early in 1996, his colleagues, especially Gordon Brown , were appalled. The idea would upset the new gods in the City of London, and in any case was wrong because it challenged the free-market orthodoxies. The only way New Labour could win and govern was to accept the Thatcherite settlement, and try to promote social justice within those constraints. And so the madnesses became rocket-propelled.</p> <p>And now the roof has fallen in, setting up potentially the most dangerous vicious circle since the Great Depression - and it could be most vicious of all here in Britain. The belief that securitised loans could always be sold or insured has proved illusory. Worse, too many have junk assets as security - commercial property, buy-to-let property, junk American loans and overstretched buyers in the residential property market. The debt will stay toxic until the economy recovers again. But worse, the margins on any new loans the banks could offer are tiny or non-existent. They have dried up, and as a result the price of property is collapsing, so that the debt is becoming even more toxic. Because everybody knows this, and nobody trusts anybody else, the banks are in a trap.</p> <p>Should the taxpayer shore up the banks' core capital to give them capacity to lend? Or should the taxpayer buy toxic debt, as the American Paulson plan proposes, and release the banks from their crippling, if self-inflicted, burden? And if so, would toxic debt from every international bank registered in London be included? In addition, should there be some form of government-sponsored insurance to support new lending? So far the British government is committed to a case-by-case, go-it-alone approach in which risking taxpayers' money is seen as an instrument of the last resort. In Japan that approach left the country saddled with zombie banks that devastated its economy for a decade. Britain's refusal to drop the laissez-faire ideology risks both that fate and a complete financial seizure in the interim.</p> <p>Yet despite the government's instincts, we have nationalised \u00a3150bn of bank assets in Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley \u2013 and last week effectively nationalised the money markets. The Bank of England has been forced to step in as a sort of ringmaster, now lending more than \u00a3100bn to banks under its special liquidity scheme, and another \u00a3100bn-plus because banks will not lend to one another. But despite this \u00a3350bn of public support, the money markets remain frozen while ordinary savers move their cash to safe havens such as National Savings, Premium Bonds, Northern Rock and Irish banks. Credit flows are dwindling to nothing. Unless there is a reversal, there will be a major economic recession \u2013 even a slump.</p> <p>The problem is that panics occur because of the primeval desire to protect oneself and one's own. The fear feeds on itself, and unless some major event brings everyone to their senses it will grow . This panic is international. What transfixed London on Tuesday was less what had happened in Britain \u2013 the necessary and inevitable action on Bradford &amp; Bingley \u2013 but the failure of the US House of the Representatives to pass the Paulson plan. Meanwhile, bank collapses required public bail-outs in France, Holland, Iceland, Belgium and Germany. Then came the Irish guarantee of every deposit in its banks.</p> <p>The Irish 'beggar thy neighbour' policy shocked Europe; such an extreme response could only have been prompted by the potential collapse of a bank. Ireland had jumped straight to the last resort policy of a blanket deposit guarantee, potentially forcing the whole of Europe to follow in fear of losing deposits to Dublin's secure accounts. The need for better European collaboration could not be better dramatised, and yesterday's Paris summit called by President Sarkozy, expected to limit such a Dutch auction in deposit guarantees, is a start. Eurosceptics in Number 10 and the Tory party may wish otherwise \u2013 but Britain alone does not have the muscle to support the vast international financial centre that is the City of London. British bank assets are five times British GDP \u2013 let alone the assets of international banks domiciled here.</p> <p>We are as vulnerable as Iceland, Switzerland and Ireland, as one top financial regulator told me. We need Europe. If the scale of the threat is obvious, so is the opportunity. A political fortune awaits the government that seizes the opportunity to rebuild the delinquent casino that is the British financial system, and around different principles \u2013 a long-term commitment to building businesses, support for investment and innovation, and fairness. Anglo-Saxon capitalism may have delivered a 10-year boom, but the price has been savagely high. Now there is a once-in- 50-years opportunity to create new institutions, new practices and new incentives. If Gordon Brown and his government eschew it they will deserve to be trounced at the general election, and then have to live with having passed up the golden opportunity of their lives.</p> <p>Talking of making bankers pay for the mess they have created, as they do in America over the Paulson plan, is pointless. The task now is to survive without a slump \u2013 and create a new financial system that moves decisively away from the mores of super gentlemanly capitalism.</p> <p>We have to mimic the Paulson plan and set up a so-called 'bad' bank, with up to \u00a3100bn of purchasing power. We must buy toxic loans from all British-based banks, with the object of selling them in better market conditions. Most such operations, as in Sweden in the Nineties or Britain in the Seventies, end up losing no money whatever. This will stop the banks becoming zombie institutions.</p> <p>Second, we have to reopen the markets in securitised assets. This requires two initiatives. The taxpayer will have to find \u00a350bn-plus to invest in the shares of our leading banks so there is no doubt they are solvent and can support both the existing level of debt and the new issue of more. The taxpayer should also give an additional stimulus by running a temporary insurance scheme so that overseas and domestic buyers of securitised loans know there is no risk of losing any money \u2013 in other words, a form of targeted and temporary deposit insurance.</p> <p>The government will become the biggest single shareholder in the financial system. It can require the banks to behave differently \u2013 to move from financing casino capitalism to productive enterprise. There can be a new emphasis on relationship building and offering cheap long-term loans to business. We should create a long-term investment bank. Investment banking and commercial banking should be split, reinforced by a British Glass Steagall Act. The British vogue for takeover can be constrained.</p> <p>The regulatory regime must be overhauled; never again should regulators turn a blind eye to off shore banking and wild ratios in which lending can reach 30 or 40 times a bank's capital. EU and American regulators need to work much more closely \u2013 and Britain needs to be part of the process. The UK taxpayer does not have the firepower to support a bust international system \u2013 one of the reasons that Brown's reluctance to consider a joint European initiative is shortsighted. We may even have to consider joining the euro to get the necessary financial power behind London.</p> <p>A 30-year experiment has come to an end. The world of go-getting investment banks has gone forever. The danger is that we go from feast to famine; debt remains a vital element in any economy, and if we too suddenly try to live without it we will crush ourselves economically. What we are witnessing is a system failure that requires a systemic response \u2013 the creation of a new system that sponsors a fairer, more productive capitalism in its place, while maintaining high flows of credit and debt.</p> <p>This is a terrifying moment; but it is also our generation's once- in-a-lifetime chance to change British capitalism. Brown has an awesome responsibility to his party and his country. I hope he rises to the challenge.</p>",
  "<p>Such is the disorientation created by the earthquake in global finance that some US Republicans last week accused President George Bush of 'socialism' for bailing out the country's financial system. Seismic activity can alter the landscape, but it cannot turn right into left. Mr Bush has not embraced Marxism. He simply recognised that leaving the market free to demolish banks would lead to economic catastrophe.</p> <p>That realisation came more naturally in Europe. French President Nicolas Sarkozy declared that 'the all-powerful market is finished'. Peer Steinbr\u00fcck, the German finance minister, predicted that the US will lose its role as a 'financial superpower'. His Italian counterpart, Giulio Tremonti, pointed out that he had written a book on the ills of globalisation, and was now vindicated. But none of their respective countries is in a position to lead the construction of a new global financial order.</p> <p>The current market turbulence does not distinguish between brands of capitalism. Financial institutions in nearly every Western economy are on the brink of collapse. Last week governments in Britain, Germany, France, Belgium, Greece, Ireland and the Netherlands all took emergency measures to rescue failing banks. In some cases, reaction appeared motivated by blind panic. Irish and Greek offers of unlimited guarantees for bank deposits were not just unilateral, they jeopardised any prospect of eurozone solidarity.</p> <p>Last night's call for a global summit by EU leaders, who have been meeting in Paris, is encouraging, suggesting a real effort by member states to overcome instinctive divisions over how to run an economy. Of the union's largest economies, Britain has favoured the 'Anglo-Saxon' model of maximum liberalisation while France and Germany have no qualms about state intervention. It is testimony to an historic failure of political will that Europe's leaders only began to negotiate past those ideological barriers when faced with a crisis of this magnitude.</p> <p>Even with the EU mobilised and the US bailout approved, the road ahead is desperately uncertain. Emergency liquidity funds might help douse the flames in the financial markets, but the discussion about what should be built in the smouldering remains has barely even begun.</p> <p>Both candidates in the US presidential election campaign backed the bailout, but neither explained how their own plans for government might be redrawn to fit the new economic landscape.</p> <p>In Britain, market convulsions forced the Tories to rewrite their conference agenda last week. David Cameron declared his readiness to take 'difficult' and 'unpopular' decisions. But that was simply a euphemism for raising taxes and cutting services to balance the government books. He also said there would be 'a day of reckoning' for profligate bankers, but in the next breath he deferred that day indefinitely.</p> <p>The more remarkable political gyration last week was performed by Gordon Brown. Just over a year ago, he promised to 'renew' the party and heal the divisions of the Blair era. On Friday, he appointed Peter Mandelson, Tony Blair's grey cardinal, to the same cabinet post he held in 1998. Brown now appears to recognise that events of this magnitude mean government has to think in fundamentally different ways about the economy, beyond the fine-tuning of fiscal and monetary policy, and instead deal with a world of food and energy shortages, as well as a credit drought.</p> <p>The Bank of England last week quietly increased the amount of emergency credit available to banks to levels equivalent in scale to the US bailout. Neither Labour nor the Tories, for all their claims, has yet spelled out what regulations should be demanded of the City as quid pro quo. No politician in Britain, the rest of Europe or the US has an answer to one basic question: how will the financial services be overhauled so they are, in future, the servant, not the master, of the global economy? We wait to see if Brown's new cabinet will offer a lead.</p> <p>The old ideological distinctions between different forms of capitalism may be melting away in the banking crisis. But for the moment, it is still the politicians, not the bankers, who look humbled by its scale.</p>",
  "<p>Opening a week on Wednesday, the BFI London Film Festival is the last big event in the 2008 film calendar. In recent weeks, we've had Venice and Toronto and, unusually, these two festivals have left the film world scratching its head as to where the Oscars are likely to go when the voting and lobbying season kicks off in earnest in December.</p> <p>Venice was considered disappointing in terms of high-end, Oscar-style film product. The festival, which in recent years has premiered awards favourites such as Brokeback Mountain, Atonement, Michael Clayton and The Queen, gave its top prize to Darren Aronofsky's The Wrestler, a film which is more likely to see nominations for its star, Mickey Rourke, than for the movie itself.</p> <p>The main reason given for this foggy outlook is the writers' strike, which crippled Hollywood at the beginning of this year and resulted in long delays to the studios completing their prestige productions. So it looks as if it's up to London to provide the clearest indicator as to which films will be up for our consideration, as the industry likes to call it, in the 2009 awards frenzy. The festival opens with Frost/Nixon, a hugely successful stage play adapted into a very fine film. Proceedings close, 15 days later, with Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire, which won the audience award at Toronto and has been gaining 'buzz' ever since as this year's Juno.</p> <p>That said, it does appear that the studios have held back their real ace cards for a late dash to the finish line. In assessing the frontrunners and red-carpet riders, I looked at the online trailers - never an indication of a film's quality, of course, but a pointer at least to tone and style - and examined pedigree, past form and potential.</p> <p>For this early look at the Oscars race I've concentrated on contenders for Best Picture. There are, of course, many other categories. British film Man on Wire should get a nomination for Best Documentary; Italy's Gomorrah, released here this week, should be a favourite for Foreign Language film, along with Laurent Cantet's brilliant, Cannes-winning The Class. In the male acting categories there may be nods for Richard Jenkins (The Visitor); Sean Penn for his portrayal of gay San Francisco politician Harvey Milk in Gus Van Sant's Milk; and Benicio del Toro for his epic, macho Che Guevara in Steven Soderbergh's double-header Che. Among the women, Kristin Scott Thomas is better than ever in I've Loved You So Long; Sally Hawkins's Berlin-winning turn in Happy-Go-Lucky is not forgotten; and Anne Hathaway in Rachel Getting Married and Angelina Jolie in Clint Eastwood's The Changeling are all attracting attention.</p> <p>As William Goldman says about Hollywood, nobody knows anything, and never is that truer than in the devilish business of predicting awards nominations. But in the spirit of educated guessing, here are some big hitters - and a little one - to watch out for.</p> <h2>Australia</h2> <p><strong>Baz Luhrmann, released Dec 26</strong></p> <p><strong>What it is </strong>Romantic epic starring Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman. She's an English aristocrat who, in the 1930s, inherits a vast ranch in northern Australia. He's the rugged stockman she hires to herd her beasts across the country's interior.</p> <p><strong>What the trailer reveals</strong> Baz Luhrmann's sense of colour is as bright as ever. Swooning photography of great rocks and deserts, as well as cattle and horses and Japanese bombers. There is clearly some filmic irony at play here, too, with mock 1930s Technicolor and old Hollywood typefaces. </p> <p><strong>Pedigree</strong> Luhrmann's first film since 2001's Best Picture nominee Moulin Rouge is eagerly awaited. Kidman hasn't had much success since winning for The Hours in 2003, but she's still a big draw. Her record in sweeping epics is poor, though: remember Cold Mountain and Far and Away</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/video/screenplay/vi2917663001/\">imdb.com/video/screenplay/vi2917663001/</a></p> <h2>Frost/Nixon</h2> <p><strong>Ron Howard, Jan 9</strong></p> <p><strong>What it is </strong>Ron Howard films Peter Morgan's own adaptation of his stage play about the famous 1977 TV interviews between chat-show host David Frost (Michael Sheen) and disgraced US President Richard Nixon (Frank Langella). The film follows the two camps as they negotiate terms, prepare questions and, finally, tape the interviews in California. </p> <p><strong>What the trailer reveals</strong> It pits the Frost camp as the little guys and Nixon as the bully. It gives a picture of the tensions and worries building on both sides, as well a sense of the post-Watergate period. The blending of real archive footage with mocked-up telecasts looks impressive.</p> <p><strong>Pedigree</strong> Ron Howard is an Oscar favourite, winning for A Beautiful Mind in 2002, but many thought he might lack the edge for this one. Morgan's stock is high after penning The Queen and The Last King of Scotland. In election year, this gripping, intelligent film is a frontrunner. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.uk.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibxs_2nDXUc\">uk.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibxs_2nDXUc</a></p> <h2>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</h2> <p><strong>David Fincher, Jan 23</strong></p> <p><strong>What it is </strong>A version of F Scott Fitzgerald's 1922 short story about a man who is born in his eighties and ages backwards. Set in New Orleans, from 1918 until the 21st century, the film stars Brad Pitt in heavy prosthetics. Cate Blanchett and Tilda Swinton co-star.</p> <p><strong>What the trailer reveals</strong> Cut and directed by Fincher himself, it appears to be a whimsical fairy tale with southern gothic overtones, played out to the music of Saint-Sa\u00ebns. There is romance and war, epic beauty and a hint of a metaphor about American history and the passing of time.</p> <p><strong>Pedigree</strong> Respected for Fight Club and Se7en, Fincher was unfortunate to be overlooked for Zodiac in 2007. The new movie's lack of obvious category might trouble Oscar voters, but it's certain to be one of the most original screen stories of the year.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/trailers/paramount/thecuriouscaseofbenjaminbutton/\">apple.com/trailers/paramount/thecuriouscaseofbenjaminbutton/</a></p> <h2>Slumdog Millionaire</h2> <p><strong>Danny Boyle, Jan 23</strong></p> <p><strong>What it is </strong>Boyle directs the story of Jamal Malik, an 18-year-old orphan from the Mumbai slums who has a nation watching as he is one question away from winning 20 million rupees on India's version of the gameshow Who Wants to Be A Millionaire?</p> <p><strong>What the trailer reveals</strong> There is as yet no official trailer on the internet but I've seen a thrilling preview at the LFF - a young boy and a police man hurtling through the slums, set to a pulsing Bollywood drum track. Think City of God meets Trainspotting.</p> <p><strong>Pedigree</strong> Despite earning kudos for Trainspotting, Boyle has never before found favour with awards bodies. Oscar loves a feelgood underdog, however - see Juno, Little Miss Sunshine - so Slumdog could just be this year's little film that does.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.foxsearchlight.com/slumdogmillionaire\">foxsearchlight.com/slumdogmillionaire</a></p> <h2>Revolutionary Road</h2> <p><strong>Sam Mendes, Jan 30</strong></p> <p><strong>What it is </strong>An adaptation of Richard Yates's shattering novel about the 1950s American suburban dream. Directed by Sam Mendes, it stars Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio as a young couple struggling to cope with the gradual domestication of their artistic ideals.</p> <p><strong>What the trailer reveals</strong> Leo, though still youthful, looks the right age, drinks martinis, smokes a lot and loses his temper in the kitchen. Kate looks lovely but a bit frumpy. </p> <p><strong>Pedigree</strong> Mendes has successfully entered the marital maelstrom before in American Beauty; Kate has been nominated five times; Leo is an Academy darling (The Departed, The Aviator), though not yet a winner. As a pair, of course, they were last seen together in the Oscar-busting Titanic. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.alltrailers.net/revolutionary-road.html\">alltrailers.net/revolutionary-road.html</a></p> <h2>The Soloist</h2> <p><strong>Joe Wright, Feb 6</strong></p> <p><strong>What it is </strong>The tale of an LA Times journalist (Robert Downey Jr) who strikes up a friendship with a homeless schizophrenic cello genius (Jamie Foxx) and, in a series of groundbreaking articles, draws attention to LA's homeless problem.</p> <p><strong>What the trailer reveals</strong> We're in for some beautiful music - Stevie Wonder, Beethoven - and touching drama as Downey and Foxx riff off each other. Catherine Keener provides indie cred. Downtown LA looks a mess while Frank Gehry's Disney concert hall shines. </p> <p><strong> Pedigree</strong> Hollywood feels it owes Wright after overlooking him for Atonement last year. Downey, after rehab, is back on top of the hill after Iron Man. Foxx is a previous winner for playing another handicapped musician, Ray Charles. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.uk.youtube.com/watch?v=JUnv4XAiL6I\">uk.youtube.com/watch?v=JUnv4XAiL6I</a></p>",
  "<p>For screenwriters, American politics is a well of stories that never stops giving, The Candidate, Primary Colors and The West Wing among others.

  "<p>We are now several weeks into the weird humiliation that the Republican party inflicted upon us Americans with their choice of Sarah Palin as their nominee for Vice-President. Here we are, at as precarious a crossroad as history is ever likely to offer up, yet there stands Sarah Palin regurgitating George W Bush's 'good guys-bad guys' baby talk. I despair. </p> <p>When I hear her failing to recall the name of a single newspaper she'd ever read, I feel willing to offer up my teenage son as a sacrifice to the Republican party; he could serve in her stead with so much more fluency. When she prattles smoothly yet non-responsively to questions about the war, economics or foreign policy - or when she brightly changes the subject altogether - I want to weep.</p> <p>Palin is a never-ending train wreck of ignorance, inconsistency, outright contradiction and sneering. During her debate with Democratic vice-presidential nominee Joe Biden, she chatted up soccer moms and hockey moms, her mom and her pop and, by golly, yours too. She winked and she dimpled and 'goshed' and 'doggoned' it. She gave a 'shout-out' to some third graders in Wasilla, promising 'extra credit' for staying up to listen. </p> <p>Less remarked upon was the substance. Despite the enormous variety of public crises we face, she dismissed virtually all forms of government regulation by invoking 'private contract' rather than collective duty; 'personal responsibility' rather than public oversight; and 'tolerance' rather than civil rights. She misspoke the name of a commanding general, she went unchallenged when she expressed her arch-creationist belief that humanity has had no hand in global warming, tucking all that away cosily but dismissively: 'I don't wanna argue about causes.'</p> <p>Similarly, Palin was unchallenged in her head-spinning assertions about the powers of the vice-presidency, endorsing an unqualified 'flexibility' possibly exceeding Dick Cheney's assertion of a vastly expanded, alarmingly imperial concept of a 'unitary executive'. At the same time, her answers were so vague and addled that it was hard to tell if she actually knew what she was saying.</p> <p>Yet the morning after the debate with Biden, polls showed that the race was still too close to call. If Biden 'won' based on knowledge and experience, it was not by enough of a margin to inspire a significant shift. Indeed, pundits of all political persuasions were dissecting Palin's ability to 'hold her own' as though it were an actual measure of whether she could run the republic. Pat Buchanan, gleeful mouthpiece of the far right, celebrated Palin as 'a fresh voice' with a 'new vocabulary'. 'She tossed away the questions,' he gloated as though this were a good thing. 'She answered what she wanted to.'</p> <p>Presenters on Rupert Murdoch's Fox News channel lined up to decry the way 'we journalists' tend to 'value knowledgeability' while true Americans 'connect to her style'. Greta Van Susteren, an experienced lawyer and ubiquitous television commentator, opined: 'Whether I agree with her or not, the important thing is whether she's plain-talking ... I may have had the fancy education, but I love the plain talk, the direct words. I'm a Midwesterner.' (Whew. Whatever is the value of a fancy education if not to inoculate against such blather?)</p> <p>The enthusiasm for the Alaskan governor reminds me of an exercise I once conducted with students. I played them a segment of the 2007 debate between S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal and Nicolas Sarkozy. Very few understood French, so it was effectively an exercise in reading body language. They were convinced that Royal had won the argument because she seemed 'emphatic' and 'passionate' and 'repeated her points a lot'.</p> <p>The clip I had played, however, was Royal's least convincing moment in that debate: she was delivering a mawkish, inappropriately long-winded tongue-lashing about Sarkozy's purported failure to tackle the plight of handicapped children. Although her body language might have telegraphed earnest conviction, the words she was repeating with such focused intensity were something along the lines of: 'I am not going to pieces, I am angry, I am angry, I am angry.'</p> <p>Even if one's political sympathies lay with Royal, it was clear why that encounter might have lost her the election. My students accurately translated Royal's passion and conviction. They also accurately translated Sarkozy's discomfort at that moment. But without an understanding of the substance of what was said, it would be impossible to see how much her words contradicted the commanding body language. </p> <p>The enthusiastic responses to Palin's presentations remind me of that exercise. Yes, Palin's delivery is perky and self-assured. But if one pays attention to the substance, it's impossibly vacuous. That so few do pay attention makes me think that listening to the debates must be like a foreign language for some of my compatriots. Perhaps this is laziness or political illiteracy. Perhaps it's a failure of education. Perhaps there's a measure of raw racism: better to vote for anyone other than the black guy. Or perhaps it's a manifestation of gender fundamentalism, by which any biological formation of a woman can stand in for Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>At least as distracting are the polarities jumbling American political discourse: i.e. not just good versus evil, male versus female, black versus white, but eastern elitism versus western frontier spirit; secular humanism versus speaking-in-tongues theocracy; scientism versus creationism; 'tolerance' versus equal rights; ultra-libertarianism versus civic engagement. </p> <p>The Republicans' best operatives have been playing these tensions against each other for decades. Against the backdrop of such a frighteningly incoherent cultural landscape, Sarah Palin plays Mom. She speaks to us in a wipe-your-nose and sit-up-straight inflection that is quite Orwellian - if Orwell had anticipated that newspeak might come packaged as old-fashioned-country-horse-sense speak.</p> <p>And so we love her, Mother Sarah. She's simple, she's pretty, she's as fierce as a tiger protecting her cubs. So what if storms are rattling the windowpanes? We get a glass of warm milk and a big gold star just for staying up late while she tells us reassuring bedtime stories.</p> <p>\u2022 Patricia Williams is a professor of law at Columbia University and a regular columnist for the Nation magazine</p>",

  "<p>On the morning I'm due to meet Camilla Wright, founding mother of the scurrilous website and online mailout, Popbitch, I while away a bit of time on a long piece in the New Yorker about the true meaning of Babar the Elephant. Its author, Adam Gopnik, posits various Babar theories: Babar is about a certain idea of France; it's an allegory of colonialism; it's a fable of the difficulties of bourgeois life. I read the piece, and I enjoy it. Still, when I'm done, what I mostly think is: yeah, right, Adam, but let's face it - what Babar's really about is an elephant who goes to the city and rides joyously up and down in a department-store elevator.</p> <p>Why am I telling you this? Well, the Babar piece and my experience of reading it was something of a rehearsal for my encounter with the world of Popbitch. While I'm in Wright's company, I take her analysis of gossip, the way she compares the secrets of the celebrity world to the 'consensus of information' that came out in the weeks before the invasion of Iraq - by which she seems to be suggesting that it's as important, say, to question a movie star's denial of his homosexuality as it is to query a government's claim about weapons of mass destruction - perfectly seriously. I nod my head, and I smile. But I'm not even halfway home before I'm thinking: but it's still gossip, isn't it? It's still who's sleeping with whom, who's taking what drug and where, who's going to be dropped by their record company, who behaves most badly in the first-class cabins of aeroplanes. </p> <p>Am I wrong to feel this? Possibly. Among other interesting facts that you really do need to know about Popbitch is that one of its 'friends' is Adam Curtis, the award-winning film-maker, a major theme of whose work is the way various elites try to impose their ideology on the rest of us (you will remember The Power of Nightmares, which drew parallels between the rise of radical Islam and of the American neocons). 'He's not really an editor,' says Wright, with a playful smile, when I ask her about his role. 'He's a friend.' How did they become friends? 'He liked reading Popbitch, and I liked watching his shows. Everyone [who is connected with the site] has that thing of wanting to go against the consensus, against the status quo. The world of pop culture is so important now, it's like a new establishment. So working out what's going on in that world is similarly interesting for him - and yes, there's also his obsession with marmots [Popbitch has a long-running fixation with pictures of cute animals, especially otters]. There are people who've read or contributed to Popbitch for years; they're a sounding board. Adam Macqueen of Private Eye is another.' In the past, Wright has talked about wanting to 'democratise gossip', saying that she dislikes the idea of the chattering classes in London knowing about something when the man in an office in Walsall does not. Is this still how she feels? Because it seems to me that, on this score, her work might now be done. 'Oh, there are definitely still secrets,' she says. 'Just because some celebrities are willing to put up their lives for public consumption doesn't mean that the stories that go around the chattering classes always come out.'</p> <p>Popbitch, which is now eight years old, is sent to 370,000 registered subscribers (of which I am one) every Thursday. It consists of gossip, jokes, pop facts, bizarre web links and pictures of furry animals, and is sometimes described, even by Wright herself, as the bastard child of Smash Hits and Private Eye. In other words, it manages to be both sweet and wicked at the same time; it loves a good pop song, and finds some celebs rather wondrous, but it takes pride in knocking others down, especially those who are seen to have ideas above their station (a particular bugbear are the demands celebrities make backstage, or on those working for or serving them). The strange and rather charming thing about Popbitch is that it has, over the years, managed to maintain an underground, homespun feel as its influence has grown and grown. Even if you've never heard of it, you will have bumped into it inadvertently. For one thing, it pioneered the 'blind story', the trick of writing about a celebrity without mentioning their name, leaving the reader to guess at their identity - a libel-swerve that is now aped by every tabloid. For another, it was the first to break such stories as David Beckham's infidelity (18 months before the News of the World), and the sexual antics of the former candidate for the leadership of Liberal Democrats. Most significantly of all, when it comes to the culture, the phrases it favours seep into our everyday language like sewage into the sea: Croydon facelift (hair scraped into a too-tight pony tail); pramface (teen mother in a track suit); tanorexic (addiction to being orange). Was it Popbitch or The Darkness who got us all calling cocaine 'gak'? Something tells me it was probably the former. </p> <p>For a long time, the people behind Popbitch refused to talk about it publicly. Then, slowly, they - or she - came out into the open (spurred on, perhaps, by the conviction of Julie Burchill that it was actually written by the Pet Shop Boys). Similarly, for a long time, those involved resisted the expansion of the brand. 'We were approached to do television, books and albums every year, pretty much from when we started,' says Wright. But she always said no. Even now, she claims not to know how much Popbitch would be worth were a decision taken to sell it. 'I've no idea. We've had lots of offers, but we've never got to the point of working that out.' </p> <p>But while Popbitch may not have many assets - her computer address book is about the beginning and the end of those - it is now a highly significant brand. Does this mean that she simply isn't motivated by money? 'I'm less motivated by money than I am by doing something that's fun, or that's having an effect. But if you go into any kind of journalism, you're not motivated by money, unless you're stupid.' She laughs. </p> <p>Nevertheless, the Popbitch website now links to Popbet, a reality-TV gambling site, and to the Popbitch online radio station (now playing, er ... 'My Name is Tallulah', from the Bugsy Malone soundtrack). This month, a Popbitch book is published, in time for Christmas. It's like an old-fashioned annual, and includes the first-ever issue of Popbitch ('Only a couple of months until Meg Mathews gives birth, and the world wants to know what the name will be ...'), a dress-your-own cut-out Pete Burns doll, and a list of the worst-ever celebrity baby names (the son of the actress Shannyn Sossamon is called Audio Science - honestly). It's very rude, and it's very funny. For reasons I cannot quite explain, I've only to look at its reconstruction - starring a cuddly toy, and two plastic dolls - of the moment when Montcore, the white tiger belonging to the Las Vegas stars Siegfried and Roy, turned on Roy and tried to eat him, to break into childish laughter. </p> <p>The Popbitch office is next door to a Soho betting shop, and is a good deal smaller than Posh Spice's (aka 'Skeletor' in Popbitch-speak) smallest wardrobe, or so I'm guessing. 'This is basically ... it,' says Wright, waving one arm at the gloomy cubicle that houses her desk and that of her sole employee, a work-experience intern (the technical people, who are not employed by Popbitch full-time, all work outside London). So how does the mailout happen? 'I have 300 to 400 repeat sources, of which 50 are really good,' she says, of those who give her stories (for which they are not paid). 'Over the years, I've got to know lots of them. It is weird: it's new media, yet you rely on the same tricks as old media. Some you meet face to face; they're more comfortable with that. Some love being anonymous. Some I've had email relationships with for eight years: they could be someone's cleaner, or they could be Madonna.' </p> <p>But how does she know if what they tell her is true? 'You've got to have intuition and, over time, that builds up. There are patterns. With some sources, you know the kind of things they [are likely to] know. Too much detail is a sign someone is making it up. Sometimes you know it's true because it's the kind of thing that wouldn't be worth making up. Some things you want to be true, then you find out that it is not very likely they are. I do try to do as much checking as possible with secondary sources.' Does she still feel a prick of excitement when someone emails her a story? 'Yes, if it's a good one. Or when you get some interaction: if it hits a nerve, or you've got something right.' Last month, she ran what she regards as a fairly perfect Popbitch story about the fact that the satirist Chris Morris cannot find a TV channel willing to make his new comedy about a bunch of inept Yorkshire jihadis (it's perfect because it's gossip, but gossip that touches on issues of political correctness and censorship). In the following days, eight contacts emailed to confirm the story, or to relate similar experiences of their own.</p> <p>Wright has a deliciously ironic face. It's hard to know what she's really thinking. So, I honestly can't tell: does she really take celebrity gossip (most of the stuff she runs is a bit more low rent than the Chris Morris story) seriously, or is it just a laugh? 'It's both,' she says, straight off. 'I'm not ironic about pop, or pop culture. I think a lot of the people in it are fabulous. I look back to being 11 or 12, and getting into bands for the first time... The first Japan album! I still look at it at home, and it still makes me excited. Pop culture enriches life. It's tosh, but it's brilliant, lovable tosh. It deserves to be treated with some love. But at the same time, there are actors who pronounce on world affairs. That needs to be policed.' She hesitates. 'It's loving the bullshit, but at the same time wanting to point out the stupidity.' So I guess a lawyer always reads Popbitch first? 'No!' Her eyes widen. 'Because what would they leave in?' Wright has had her share of scary legal letters over the years, but the good news is that most celebrities are apparently so insecure and vain (or so sassy and well advised: take your pick) that they want to be seen to be in on the joke. Well, hooray. As for whether they get the other jokes, the proper, old-fashioned gags that are attached to the end of Popbitch every week, somehow, I doubt it. The last one I read relied for its punchline on the reader knowing the difference between a Freudian, a Jungian and a Lacanian - not a line that would have Jordan rolling around on her bedroom floor, I fear.</p> <p>Popbitch started in 2000, when Wright was freelancing for magazines like The Face, and her then boyfriend, Neil Stevenson, who is still the co-owner of Popbitch though no longer involved on a day-to-day basis, was working at Heat (which then was just another entertainment magazine with vaguely highbrow pretensions). Both of them despised the way PRs controlled stars, but they also shared a conviction that grown-ups could enjoy both Private Eye and Smash Hits. So they began writing Popbitch. The first issue was sent to 15 friends; by issue 10, this had swollen to 80; by issue 20, they had 1,000 subscribers. What Wright felt then, she still feels today: 'I want people who get it to like it, rather than just to chuck it away.' She would rather have 370,000 truly devoted fans than 500,000 half-hearted ones - and all the evidence suggests that this is, indeed, what she has got. The Popbitch message board, on which readers can post stories and chat to one another, is a unique and somewhat introverted community. 'It's bizarre. There have been weddings, and babies, among people who post on it. Unlike most online communities, it has a basis in real life. It's the sort of place where, if you lose your house, someone on the message board will offer you a place to stay. A lot of people lose their jobs because they spend so long on it. But it is quite vicious. It's like a playground. You have to be strong enough, to be able to hand out insults, to stay there.' Some posters have become minor celebrities in their own right. When one, Reverend Goatboy, died in 2007, his passing was noted in The Times.</p> <p>Wright, who is 37, grew up in Plymouth; her father is retired, and her mother is a cleaner at a hospital. She went to a grammar school, and then to Oxford, to Oriel, then one of the university's most male, and most traditional, colleges. 'It was like going into a different universe. It was the time of house music and clubs. I'd spent the months before working in Tenerife in a night club. Then I came back and I went to Oxford. So that was quite a strange experience. On the first day, I was in an expensive, white, Italian track suit with a baseball cap. Everyone else was in rugby shirts, and the girls were all in nice clothes. I felt like an alien. The first term was hard. But underneath, everyone is quite similar at the age of 18. I'm sure I changed, and they changed, too. I still have really good friends from there.' Is this where her outsider tendency - her sceptical, satirical eye; the Popbitch alertness to the myriad calibrations of style and social class - comes from originally? Another butter-wouldn't-melt smile. 'Perhaps.' She is certainly quite tough, I think. She has been gossiped about herself, and she is 'OK' with it. 'You have to be. You can't dish it out and not take it.' Is she thick-skinned? 'Probably. I want Popbitch to go for hard targets not just soft ones, so you have to be: people are going to be shouting at you.'</p> <p>Because Wright was in at the beginning of the crazed birth of 21st-century gossip - where Popbitch led, Heat, Holy Moly, Gawker and a zillion others followed, albeit in less sophisticated fashion - people expect her to be able tell us where it is going, too. And she can, to a degree. But don't get your hopes up. When I ask her if we might already have passed its high watermark (the sales of certain gossip magazines have taken a slight dip lately), she shakes her head. 'I think that's about content. If all you get is pictures of celebrities looking bad, you think: \"Oh God, someone else with a sweat patch.\"' She has never done stories about 'women and appearance and weight problems' because she thinks 'there's enough misogyny and self-hatred elsewhere'. She's also wary of pregnancy and child-related stories. 'We're pushing at the boundaries of the privacy of the womb, now, desperate to get a woman to say she's pregnant. We did put something in about J-Lo expecting twins, but I did it because it came from a friend of hers who said it was an open secret. Serious illness ... cancer ... pictures of Patrick Swayze and Paul Newman [both have cancer] and stories saying how terrible they look. I know it's news, but I'm uncomfortable with it.' She pauses. 'But maybe it's not voyeuristic. We all face death. I did some talks at summer schools at the LSE and Westminster University. One of the things you can do now is come from around the world and do a course in London in celebrity media. It was interesting. Most students didn't see anything wrong in the coverage of illness.' </p> <p>So where are we going? 'I don't know. But if we're looking into the future, I can see the paps pushing cameras into the faces of small children, and [the mourners] at funeral processions. It's got a long way to go yet. Gossip has been part of human existence since we learned to communicate. It used to be localised, but now our lives are so fragmented, we don't really know our neighbours, and thanks to the technology and global stars, it's so easy to gossip about them instead. So long as people are willing to put their lives out there for us to laugh at for money or fame, I can't see any of it going away.' The trouble is, though, that for someone like her, who claims to want to go against the consensus, this constant policing is counter-productive - as even she concedes. 'If you look at the American election campaign, everything is focused on who's saying what, and what the nuances are.' Policy? It's as rare as a picture of Victoria Beckham smiling.</p> <p>Some people have taken Mark Frith's recent book about his decade as editor of Heat as a mea culpa - and it's true that, occasionally, a batsqueak of contrition can be heard emanating from its pages. But it's mostly just an attempt on his part to reposition himself for the next stage of his media career, just as Piers Morgan, the former editor of the Daily Mirror, did when he published The Insider. But Wright isn't like either of these men; she may not be guilt-ridden (she definitely isn't, if you ask me), but nor is she a media tart. She doesn't want to hang with celebrities; nor does she want to be a judge on some seventh-rate TV talent show. Still, the truth is that I can't quite put my finger on what motivates her. Which brings me back to Babar. Maybe it's very simple, after all. Popbitch is gossip, and Wright likes gossip. So, she will go on sending it to us until she doesn't like it any more. And then she'll do something else. And, since she is so bright and funny, that will be a big success, too. </p> <p>In the meantime, safely at home, I'm waiting for Popbitch, a taster of which she gave me only hours before. And here it comes ... a TV presenter can't sing, even though he's landed a job that requires it; a royal hanger-on has an increasingly indiscreet drug habit; a football player is losing his hair faster than 'a Chernobyl engineer'; John McCain mentions that the bracelet he wears belonged to an 'Iraq veteran who was killed' at every opportunity. My eye skims down the screen, as it is has done every Thursday for several years. You can look for the subtext, for sure. But it's probably more fun to enjoy the bad behaviour, and give grateful thanks that, while the rich and famous might have more shoes, cars and homes than you, the filter between their brains and their mouths is in need of some serious repair.</p> <p>\u2022 Popbitch 2009 is out 16 October</p>",
  "<p>The 'suitcase girl' who discovered $800,000 in cash and ignited a political scandal across South America - then capitalised on it to forge a career as a Playboy pin-up - has relived her moment of glory in a Miami courtroom.</p> <p>Mar\u00eda del Luj\u00e1n Telpuk, 28, an Argentinian former airport security officer, is testifying in court about the moment she intercepted a suitcase and provoked a row between the governments of Argentina, Venezuela and the US. Claims of high-level corruption, cover-ups and vendettas have followed and commentators have dubbed the scandal 'Maletagate'; maleta is Spanish for suitcase.</p> <p>The furore catapulted Telpuk to stardom as a glamour model, dancer and television celebrity. Telpuk, who promptly underwent breast augmentation surgery, has since appeared on the cover of several magazines, including the Argentinian edition of Playboy in which she appears naked, holding a suitcase, under the headline 'Corruption Laid Bare'.</p> <p>She told a Miami court on Friday what happened at Buenos Aires airport on the night of 4 August, 2007, when passengers disembarked from a flight chartered by Venezuela's state oil company, PDVSA.</p> <p>Telpuk asked a Venezuelan-American businessman, Guido Alejandro Antonini Wilson, what was in his suitcase. 'At first he said books,' she told the court. 'Then he said \"just some papers\".' Antonini's demeanour changed when she ordered him to open it. 'He became serious and he was staring me straight in the eye. That's when I got a suspicion that something was going on,' said Telpuk. It was packed with wads of $50 bills. </p> <p>Prosecutors allege that it was a clandestine payment from Venezuela's President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez to the election campaign of Cristina Kirchner, a left-wing ally who was sweeping to Argentina's presidency.</p> <p>Both leaders have dismissed the accusation as an attempt by Washington to smear two governments which have challenged 'gringo hegemony' in Latin America. </p> <p>Telpuk has testified in the trial of Franklin Dur\u00e1n, a wealthy Venezuelan businessman who is accused of acting as an illegal agent for his government. He and four others were arrested in Miami after allegedly pressuring Antonini, who resides in Key Biscayne, Florida, to conceal the truth about where the money came from.</p> <p>The unusual nature of the charge and the elaborate FBI sting - Antonini co-operated with the Bureau - has prompted widespread speculation that the trial is a politically motivated attempt to embarrass Washington's enemy, President Ch\u00e1vez.</p> <p>After finishing her testimony next week, Telpuk is expected to return to Argentina, where she is training to become a professional ice-skater to participate in the Skating for a Dream television show.</p>",
  "<p>A worldwide economic crisis can make a lot of difference to a voter. Or at least it has done to Isabelle Murawski. For the past two elections, the pensioner has reliably voted for George W Bush, casting her ballot in Florida's Broward County, one of the epicentres of the voting debacle that saw Bush win the White House in 2000. </p> <p>But now Murawski is going to vote for Barack Obama. 'I am supporting Obama, I think,' she said, while strolling in Florida's warm sunshine in the coastal resort town of Hollywood. 'It's the economy first and foremost. Everyone I know is worried about their pensions.'</p> <p>Murawski is not alone in switching sides in Florida. In the past few weeks the polls in this vital southern swing state have taken a remarkable turn. After long months of the Republican candidate John McCain being comfortably ahead, Obama has suddenly surged forward. Four recent polls have put Obama between four and eight points ahead in Florida. It is a hugely significant development. McCain almost certainly cannot win the keys of the White House without Florida's 27 precious electoral college votes. 'There is clearly something going on. There has been a solid swing to Obama,' said Professor Lance DeHaven-Smith, who is a political scientist at Florida State University.</p> <p>The development mirrors a trend nationwide. In the face of the economic disaster gripping America, the presidential race has undergone yet another about-face. Voters have broken narrowly but firmly for Obama, and McCain has seen his support wither in the face of the crisis. Polls consistently show Obama with a solid four or five-point lead. Previously long-shot Republican states like North Carolina, Georgia and Virginia have suddenly become Democratic possibilities. In the meantime, McCain's campaign has decided to pull out of Michigan, writing off the state in favour of easier targets. </p> <p>But it is Florida that all eyes have now turned to. An Obama victory there would virtually assure that America gets its first ever black President. It would also go some way to purging the dreadful scars still lingering in the Democratic psyche after the disputed 2000 election result. No Democrat can ever forget the saga of the hanging chads - the spoiled ballot papers that led to a protracted recount and a United States Supreme Court ruling which ensured that Bush won both Florida and the White House.</p> <p>Now eight years of Republican rule could end in the very same state where they began. 'I think a lot of Democrats in Florida would finally feel vindicated,' said DeHaven-Smith.</p> <p>The key to winning in Florida is a 132-mile stretch of busy road known as Interstate 4, or I-4. The road cuts across the heart of the state, stretching from Tampa Bay to Daytona Beach. It is both the literal and metaphorical middle ground of Florida politics. It bridges the gap between the Republican core of northern Florida, which is very much a part of the conservative Deep South, and the large Democrat-leaning cities of the south-east, such as Miami and Fort Lauderdale. </p> <p>This so-called 'I-4 corridor' is home to most of Florida's independent voters and is some of the hardest contested political turf in the whole of America. At its heart is the sprawling city of Orlando and the fierce battle that is being waged there seems to be being won by Obama. Certainly Terrence Golden, a kitchen manager at an Orlando restaurant, is backing Obama. He is one of the hundreds of thousands of transplants to the I-4 corridor who have come south seeking jobs and sunshine and was in no doubt as to where his vote was going. 'McCain is more of the same - just look at all the mess they have created already. We need a change,' he said.</p> <p>Obama is hoping to capitalise on a lot more voters like Golden. So far, the effort has gone well. His campaign has spent vast amounts of cash in Florida and set up a large organisation to register new voters, especially among blacks and students. It has 350 paid staff in the state, compared with 70 working for McCain. It has outspent its rival by $8m. Obama's political ads have saturated the airwaves and surrogate campaigners, such as Bill and Hillary Clinton and General Wesley Clark, have regularly been on the stump, along with Obama himself. </p> <p>It has worked. Registered Democrats now outnumber Republicans by some half a million. The campaign has registered 110,000 new black voters alone - they support Obama over McCain by a margin of nine to one. </p> <p>'The Obama campaign has been extremely effective and aggressive in Florida. Now, turnout on election day is the key thing that could decide it. Will these new voters actually come to the polls?' said Professor Susan McManus, of the University of South Florida.</p> <p>Other factors have also played into Obama's hands. Florida's large population of retired pensioners has been acutely sensitive to the recent financial crisis, worrying over pension funds and nest eggs. The state, much of which seems covered in new housing, has also been badly hit by foreclosures. In both cases, voters seem to be putting the blame squarely at the feet of the Republican party.</p> <p>Obama has also made strong inroads among Florida's Hispanic population. Traditionally, the state's Spanish-speaking citizens have been Republican-friendly and dominated by Cuban-Americans with hawkish foreign policy views. However, in recent years Florida has seen a large influx of non-Cuban Hispanics, among whom Obama has been performing strongly. As a result, recent polls have Obama winning Florida's Hispanic vote by 49 to 43 per cent. A wave of Spanish-language ads will surely have helped that process.</p> <p>There is little doubt that Florida's Republicans are in something of a panic about recent developments. Last week leading party officials met in the city of Tallahassee for a secret war council to discuss how to fight back. The hour-long meeting, hosted by Florida's Republican party chairman Jim Greer, was described by one official as 'tense'. That was music to the ears of the Democrats, who are now plotting to solidify their lead and turn once reliably red Florida firmly blue. 'If the Democrats win Florida, it will be like gravy for them. It will be the icing on the cake,' said McManus.</p> <p>But it is clearly far too early for Obama supporters to declare a Florida victory. The remarkable 2008 election has had a staggering array of twists and turns. The only certain thing appears to be: expect the unexpected. It could all easily turn around again in the last four weeks of the campaign. Back on the streets of Hollywood, support for McCain is still very easy to find. Jack Smile owns a small jewellery and gift shop on the main street. He has run it for 13 years and is suffering in the current economic crisis. </p> <p>But Smile is sticking with McCain, seeing Obama as too inexperienced and na\u00efve compared against McCain's long record in office and his Vietnam war heroics. 'Obama does not have the experience like McCain. McCain has fought for this country. He has undertaken real service,' Smile said.</p> <p>Such comments serve as a reminder that McCain's campaign and core message still resonate deeply in Florida. The state has a huge population of military veterans, who represent one of McCain's core areas of demographic support. It also boasts a large Jewish population, often retired, who favour McCain for his consistently hawkish foreign policy and staunch support of Israel. </p> <p>McCain's choice of Sarah Palin, the Alaskan governor, as a running mate has also been a big hit in the state, especially after her feisty and reputation-saving performance in the vice-presidential debate last week. Palin has drawn huge crowds across Florida and her folksy charm and strong religious background have been a boost to the state's evangelicals who are key to the Republicans' 'get out the vote' efforts on election day. Smile was a big fan of Palin. 'After he picked Palin, that kind of persuaded me. She talks to the people. She is very appealing,' he said.</p> <p>Such a view is common in Florida, which is why no one is declaring that the battle for the state is over. 'It could easily swing back and forth again,' said McManus. McCain's camp still has formidable resources to deploy. Although outnumbered in terms of staff, it has many more campaign offices in Florida than Obama. It also raised twice as much cash in the state as Obama in August, a sure sign of strong support when people put their money where they say their vote is. Republicans also have tactical options left to them as the campaign enters its final stages. </p> <p>Many experts expect the party's formidable attack machine to crank up issues around Obama's former pastor, the Rev Jeremiah Wright, in the last couple of weeks of electioneering. That could have a big effect in a southern state like Florida, where racial prejudices can still play a role at the polls, and where Wright's black nationalism is likely to scare many white voters. </p> <p>'You have to think that will happen. It is an obvious card to play, and if I am thinking of it, you can bet highly paid Republican campaign advisers have thought of it too,' said Professor Aubrey Jewett, a political expert at the University of Central Florida.</p> <p>There is also the looming spectre of a repeat of the debacle of 2000. Florida's voting laws and the technologies inside the voting booths have chopped and changed since that election ended up being decided in the courts. The state has moved from paper ballots to computers, and back to paper again. But few experts think the system is flawless or 100 per cent trustworthy. </p> <p>Any close election in Florida, or one marred by dirty tricks, could easily end up a disaster. Indeed, both sides have already accused the other of dubious activities regarding voter registration.</p> <p>'We are likely to see a lot of confusion at the polls, and in a close election that could be a real problem,' said DeHaven-Smith, raising the prospect of a possible return to the law courts after election day. That seems almost unimaginable. Certainly a strong Obama supporter like Golden does not want to think about it. He was confident of a Democratic win in the state. 'Obama, no drama!' he joked, repeating an Obama campaign slogan. </p> <p>But that is likely to prove a futile hope. When the White House itself is at stake and when Florida could make or break a presidential campaign, drama is likely to be the norm, not the exception.</p>",
  "<p>In the hours since Thursday's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/03/uselections2008.republicans\">vice-presidential debate</a>, the punditry class has filled the airwaves and web, parsing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/oct/03/uselections2008.sarahpalin2\">Sarah Palin's failure to fail</a>. But what is perhaps most striking is what Palin failed to actually say. Amid all the \"doggone\"s and \"there ya go\"s and \"Oh, yeah, it's so obvious I'm a Washington outsider\"s, Palin neglected to articulate any difference between the McCain-Palin ticket and the current team in the White house.</p> <p>Joe Biden, even if restrained at the outset, made a strong, forceful case for how the Obama-Biden ticket would be different - far better than Barack Obama himself did in his first debate against McCain. Palin, on the other hand, had all the spontaneity of a grown-up version of Small Wonder, that 1980s robot girl from Saturday night television. In the end, Biden looked like a president. And while both candidates (rightly, I think) shied away from answering the macabre \"in the event of the death of your running mate\" question, only Biden looked like he would actually be able to assume the job of president in such an awful scenario.</p> <p>Part of the problem is that Palin isn't being marketed as, nor is she expected to be, a politician. That's all well and good for PTA president, or mayor, or maybe even governor in a state without a huge number of people. But when we're talking about the highest executive office, there need to be a few criteria in place beyond relateability.</p> <p>Ironically, though, even on that, Palin falls down. She pretends to be a representative of the American everywoman (whoever that really is, I'd love to know \u2013 though I guess it has something to do with watching a child play club team sports). Yet outside of talk of theoretical football match side conversations, she had nary an argument about what these women actually need or want \u2013 or what women's rights might be in the US circa 2008.</p> <p>If the McCain-Palin ticket weren't so gleeful about her gender, it might be less of an issue. But they are, they celebrate it, the historic nature of this ticket, the sexism she may be experiencing, and yet there's not much there there, to be colloquial about it. Palin doesn't seem to offer much to women, let alone Americans.</p> <p>This became particularly glaring when Palin mentioned women's rights in an answering a foreign policy question:</p> <blockquote> <p>I had a good conversation with [Henry Kissinger] recently. And he shared with me his passion for diplomacy. And that's what John McCain and I would engage in also. But again, with some of these dictators who hate America and hate what we stand for, with our freedoms, our democracy, our tolerance, our respect for women's rights, those who would try to destroy what we stand for cannot be met with just sitting down on a presidential level as Barack Obama had said he would be willing to do.</p> </blockquote> <p>What exactly did Palin mean by \"our respect for women's rights\"? It was a curious moment, especially with the brouhaha over distasteful <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-09-10-rape-exams_N.htm\">charges for rape kits</a> while she was mayor of Wasilla. Outside of her controversially militant stance on abortion, it's unclear what Palin brings to women specifically. Is it healthcare reform? No. Education reform? Not that either. Is it equal pay for equal work \u2013 something relatively uncontroversial? She says she supports it, but McCain recently failed to support the <a href=\"http://www.rhrealitycheck.org/blog/2008/10/03/both-candidates-say-they-favor-equal-pay-but-how-do-they-vote\">Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Restoration Act</a>.</p> <p>Just being a woman doesn't make Palin the better champion, and I suspect this is why she didn't elaborate further. Biden, on the other hand, briefly mentioned <a href=\"http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_plank/archive/2008/08/25/the-strange-silence-on-biden-s-signature-accomplishment.aspx\">authoring the Violence Against Women Act</a>. Over the course of his career, <a href=\"http://biden.senate.gov/issues/issue/?id=975b0cf4-ce25-42cc-b63d-072fb81e8618\">Biden's done a whole lot more for women</a> than Palin ever would care to. That's partly because what Palin's folksiness exposes is not so much her \"real\" American self, as her inability to see beyond her own experience. <br> But what was real, outside of Palin's \"go down to the soccer field\" asides? There was no moment more genuine than when Biden had his own real reveal, when his voice broke as he described knowing exactly what it was like to be a single parent, because he had been one, and exactly what it was like not to know whether a child would survive. That catch in his voice caught everyone in the room I was watching the debate with. We all held our breath.</p> <p>And Sarah Palin? She kept reciting her rehearsed talking points resolutely. She was so programmed, so fixated on keeping her chirpy smile and demeanour and her \"can I call you Joe\" pep going, that she missed an opening during which she might have actually come across as genuinely empathetic, as opposed to smugly anti-intellectual. Her entire discourse was a laundry list of memorised bullet points. She was completely unable to even have a \"lipstick on a pitbull\" moment. Her lines about how, oh gee who has time to know all this, the people want change, they want outsiders, fell terribly flat.<br> Her failure to be the real person she's championed for being made even more egregious her general failings as a leader. Palin completely avoided the conversation on bankruptcy, clearly not having a clue as to McCain's bankruptcy policy. She similarly didn't respond to questions on healthcare, on her own failings, on Afghanistan.</p> <p>One of my favourite analyses of the night came from <a href=\"http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_stump/archive/2008/10/02/joe-biden-inspired-veep-pick.aspx\">Noam Scheiber</a> over at the New Republic. Scheiber mocked Palin's list of pro-Israel statements, which read like a laundry list of everything she'd ever heard anyone ever say about US-Israel policy (including moving the embassy to Jerusalem, a not-uncontroversial topic) juxtaposed against Biden's pithy analysis of how Hamas came to power in the West Bank and Hizbullah achieved legitimacy in Lebanon and tied it all back to the the Bush administration's abysmal Middle East policies.</p> <p>\"No I do not,\" Palin chirped primly, when the moderator asked whether she also thought the Bush administration had done badly in the Middle East - and in fact she easily, had she been given the authority, or had the confidence, to think quickly could have positioned McCain-Palin contrary to Bush-Cheney. As Biden pointed out, Palin made no effort to articulate how McCain differs from Bush. And, to use his mother's phrase, \"God love him,\" for finally popping a hole in that scurrilous word \"maverick\" the two of them throw around like a magic cloak.</p>"
