  "<p>The thrill among the delegates here is palpable. After months of being powerless to do much except angrily accuse Barack Obama's supporters of venerating him like a cult leader, they finally have a cult leader of their own to venerate. True, there's a certain contradiction involved in making that switch. But then again, this was a crowd who'd just heard Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, inveighing against east coast elites, and Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, sneering at \"cosmopolitan\" people, a handful of whom have reportedly been sighted in Manhattan in recent years. </p> <p>Oh, and another thing that sits awkwardly with the McCain campaign's \"anti-elitism\" line: the hateful latte-sipping media types at Vanity Fair have released a calculation of the value of the outfit worn by Cindy McCain, right, when she briefly addressed the convention earlier this week. Her Chanel watch, three-carat diamond earrings, four-strand pearl necklace, shoes (designer unknown) and Oscar de la Renta dress, they estimate, will have cost between $299,100 and $313,100 (\u00a3169,000 to \u00a3177,000) - mainly depending on the precise value of the pearls. Still, give the woman a break: after all, she was a prisoner of war, wasn't she? Hold on a second. Wasn't she?</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Spotted on the front page of CNN's website yesterday: a photograph of Sarah Palin addressing the convention that caught her rapid arm movements at such a point as to give the impression she was sieg-heiling the delegates. The image vanished minutes later. No word on what kind of person would be so intent on libelling the convention's folksy Alaskan heroine in such a nasty fashion. But according to unconfirmed reports, police say the suspect was last seeing carrying a latte.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Though Palin has been trying hard to keep her family members out of the spotlight, for example by flying them all to St Paul and giving them prominent seats in the convention hall, she has made an exception for Track Palin. Her soldier son will be deploying for Iraq on September 11, she said in her speech, winning him applause. Track's courage on behalf of his country should stir the heart of every true patriot. So let's please not dwell on the fact that revealing an individual's deployment date - even when you don't do it on primetime television - is a breach of the US military's operational security procedures, an act of treachery in which only an America-hating terrorist or liberal would indulge.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> On the other hand, reports suggest it's likely that Track is only departing for preparatory training in Kuwait on September 11, and not deploying to Iraq at all, which would raise the troubling possibility that the Republican vice-presidential candidate doesn't understand what \"deploying\" means. Or that she deliberately modified the truth in order to be able to drop the symbolic date of September 11 into her convention address. But that would be cynically manipulative, so there must be some other explanation.</p>",
  "<p>Does power still come out of the barrel of a gun, or, for that matter, out of the nozzle of a petrol pump, in the 21st century? That is the question raised by Russia's actions in Georgia and elsewhere in Europe in recent months. The short answer is yes, but the long answer is likely to be no. The end of Russia's era of energy affluence is already in sight, and the limitations of its still ramshackle military forces are obvious. The leverage given to it by oil, gas, and such military strength as it possesses must inevitably diminish over the coming years. </p> <p>Equally important, Moscow's tactical victory in Georgia has left it isolated. The Russian government looked round the world for applause and support and found none. Other countries expect steadiness and prudence from a great power and, when these are lacking, tend to conclude that it is neither truly great nor truly powerful.</p> <p>Russia's earlier use of energy cuts to signal displeasure to European states whose policies it dislikes, as well as its forced takeovers of foreign enterprises, had already contributed to the picture of an increasingly unreliable and capricious regime. The settlement yesterday of the dispute over TNK-BP, the joint venture which is Russia's third largest oil company, will not much change this image. True the deal could have been more damaging to BP than it actually is, but the affair has still been resolved almost entirely on Russia's terms. </p> <p>It is evident that the United States and Europe have acted less than wisely in dealing with Russia. The project of Nato expansion up to Russia's borders, even though driven in part by the anxieties which new and prospective members entertained about Russia's intentions, might have been conducted with more sensitivity. There are genuine questions about the best way to manage the intricate nationalisms and sub-nationalisms of the Caucasus, on the one hand, and about the proper status in a sensible security system of Ukraine, a country of divided allegiance, on the other, which were pushed aside in the march to a bigger Nato.</p> <p>Vice-President Dick Cheney, yesterday dispensing rhetoric in both Georgia and Ukraine, was one of the champions of that expansion, and of the United States' plans to install missile batteries in Poland and the Czech republic. These were and are an unnecessary provocation, even though they represent no military threat whatever to Russia. The Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, may pretend otherwise during his current visit to Poland, though he knows he will not be taken seriously. But, whatever the balance of responsibility may have been, from Warsaw to Kiev to Tbilisi, red line was set against red line, and the result is that both sides are now in a quandary. The west does not see itself pulling back those Nato markers, while Russia will not let Nato expansion continue without retaliating in some dangerous and almost certainly counterproductive way. </p> <p>The beginning of wisdom for both sides might be to demilitarise the situation in Georgia, trading a limited, rather than a pointedly lavish, restoration of Georgian forces for a full Russian withdrawal into the enclaves, a large European monitoring presence, and a reduction of Russian troop strength in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The end of it might be an agreement to recognise that, whatever happens over Nato membership for Georgia, some way that is acceptable to both sides must be found of recognising Ukraine's special character and status. </p> <p>But, in an election year concessions are difficult for America, while the Russians are still so full of themselves and their little victory that they have yet to come down to earth. There needs to be a period of reflection on both sides, particularly on the Russian one. Until Russians see that they are as much in danger of making \"a historic mistake,\" in Mr Lavrov's words, as is the west, we will not see much progress.</p>",
  "<p>What's up with Nouri al-Maliki? As security anxieties subside in this slowly calming city, political speculation has rarely been so intense. First, it was Maliki's demand that all US troops leave Iraq by the end of 2011. Then came signs that his government wants to undermine the Sunni tribal militias, known as the Awakening councils, on whom the Americans have relied to defeat al-Qaida in Iraq. Now there are moves to take on the powerful Kurdish peshmerga troops and push them out of disputed areas in the strategic central province of Diyala.</p> <p>Why is the prime minister doing this? Is \"the puppet breaking his strings\", as one Arab newspaper put it? Or is the more appropriate metaphor \"dropping the mask\"? Those who knew Maliki in exile in Syria during Saddam Hussein's time now recall that he opposed the US-led invasion. His Daawa party did not attend the eve-of-invasion conference of US- and UK-supported exiles in London, and he opposed the party's decision six months later to join the hand-picked \"governing council\" set up by the first occupation overlord, Paul Bremer.</p> <p>Maliki's new line has discomforted the Americans. Some officials put on a brave face, saying it is a sign of Iraqi confidence in their own sovereignty, a development that, of course, they support as proof that the Bush administration's strategy of rebuilding a proud country is succeeding. Others say it reflects overconfidence, even hubris, as Iraq is a long way from being able to survive without US military protection.</p> <p>Either way, playing the nationalist card has huge potential consequences in Iraq. With provincial and parliamentary elections expected next year, it will sharpen the struggle for dominance in the Shia community. It is designed to undercut the appeal of the radical cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, a consistent opponent of the occupation who is re-profiling his movement on the lines of Lebanon's Hizbullah. Its Mahdi army militia will be slimmed into a group of experienced resistance fighters, kept in reserve for action against US troops rather than to fight Iraqi Sunnis, while the rest of the movement goes into communal politics.</p> <p>Posing as the nationalist who managed to get the US to accept a timetable for withdrawal (the tense negotiations could yet founder) allows Maliki to distance himself from his main Shia allies in government, the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq (ISCI), seen as keen backers of the occupation. It also diverts attention from the chronic power cuts and other economic troubles. Every government has to fight on its record in office, but, by turning himself into a patriotic Iraqi hero, Maliki may sidestep this. Some observers suggest he may even go to the elections on a \"prime minister's list\", to redefine himself as no longer a Shia or a political Islamist, so as to win support from Iraq's secular and non-sectarian urban middle class. But there are uncomfortable echoes here of the effort by Ayad Allawi, the prime minister appointed by the US in 2004, to project himself in the December 2005 elections as a strong man. His vote total fell a long way below his expectations. </p> <p>But if Maliki wants to present a new image as a man who stands up to the Americans, why does he choose this moment to go after Sunnis and Kurds? The principle of disarming all militias, and not just those of his Shia rivals, such as Sadr, may be laudable but the timing is highly risky and threatens to overload the circuits. Going after the Sunnis and Kurds may fail, dooming Maliki to defeat. Many Sunnis already believe he is a tool of the Iranians. Now they say his sudden anti-Americanism is no proof of Iraqi patriotism, but just shows he is a tool of Tehran. The Iranians want the US out of Iraq, not only in order to undermine US credibility in the region. They interpret Washington's support for the Awakening councils as a tilt towards the Sunnis and an effort to re-balance Iraqi politics from the Shia dominance of the early post-invasion period.</p> <p>Maliki's tough stance towards the US could doom him personally. The US toppled his predecessor, Ibrahim Jaaferi, and, even though US power in Iraq has declined since then, it may find a way to remove Maliki too. It would not demand that the prime minister go, as it did in 2006, but could undermine his parliamentary majority. The US has alternative candidates, including the ambitious vice-president, Adel Abdel Mahdi, and the Sunni defence minister, Abdul Qader al-Obeidi, who told the New York Times in January that US troops would be needed for another 10 years.</p> <p>Whatever his motives, Maliki's move has certainly shaken up Iraqi politics and forced the issue of a clear US departure timetable on to the agenda. The Iraqi prime minister has put Bush and McCain on to the back foot, and given help to Obama. Whether Maliki or Bush blinks first remains to be seen.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:j.steele@theguardian.com\">j.steele@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Over the past 20 months of campaigning Barack Obama's team has built a reputation for discipline: the inner circle decides on a message, passes it down and everyone sticks to it. But since John McCain's introduction of his running mate, the Obama side has shown uncertainty about how to deal with the Sarah Palin phenomenon.</p> <p>\"They blew it, this was not good,\" a prominent Democrat said yesterday. While the anti-George Bush tide in the country would be enough to see Obama into the White House, he argued, the presence of Palin would make the race closer. </p> <p>He felt Obama's side had walked into a Republican mousetrap by demonstrating class and gender prejudice against a modern, middle-class woman.</p> <p>The initial reaction from the Obama team was to criticise McCain for picking someone with so little experience, but a few hours later there was a joint statement from Obama and his vice-presidential running mate, Joe Biden, welcoming as historic the Republicans' first woman vice-presidential candidate. </p> <p>Obama's team then joined in the trawl through her background and Biden went on to call her \"good looking\" - a comment many could regard as patronising - before saying her speech lacked substance.</p> <p>The latter is the approach many Democrats thought the Obama team should have taken from the start, presenting the Republicans as the tired old party, short of ideas, in contrast to the Democrats.</p> <p>Tad Devine, chief strategist for the unsuccessful 2004 presidency run by Democratic John Kerry, said yesterday the best way was to point out that Palin \"said practically nothing about the biggest issues of our time\". Like other Democrats, Devine thinks Palin's impact will quickly wane. Vice-presidents normally are only prominent at three points in a campaign: when chosen, at their convention speech, and during the vice-presidential debate. When Biden faces Palin at the debate he will need to balance the desire to show off his experience of foreign affairs against appearing patronising.</p> <p>The task for Democrats is to stop Palin winning over women; they could focus on her social conservatism - her anti-abortion and creationism stances.</p> <p>Devine said he thought it was legitimate for Obama to look at how Palin was appointed by McCain, with the vetting done only the day before, and thought that while her speech would appeal to the Republican base it might not go down so well with the independents, needed by McCain.</p>",
  "<p>John McCain sought last night to match Barack Obama's inspirational speech in Denver last week with one that highlighted his differences from the Democratic candidate, yet appealed for a bipartisan approach to politics.</p> <p>McCain, who has a poor history as an orator, was placed under more pressure because of the highly-praised performance of his running mate, Sarah Palin, at the Republican convention on Wednesday night. His advisers said he would focus on the differences between himself and Obama on tax, oil drilling, and foreign affairs, particularly the Iraq war.</p> <p>McCain, more comfortable in town hall question-and-answer sessions with the public rather than high-blown rhetoric, tried to recreate the intimacy of those occasions by extending the podium out into the audience. He said he had a record of working with Democrats, and the scars from angry Republicans to prove it.</p> <p>\"The constant partisan rancour that stops us from solving these problems isn't a cause, it's a symptom,\" he said. \"It's what happens when people go to Washington to work for themselves and not you. Again and again, I've worked with members of both parties to fix problems that need to be fixed. That's how I will govern as president. I will reach out my hand to anyone to help me get this country moving again.\"</p> <p>His speech, written mainly by his long-time associate, Mark Salter, was intended as the finale of a truncated convention that saw the Republicans, normally suspicious of the maverick senator as not conservative enough, unite behind him, partly because of his adoption of Palin as his running mate.</p> <p>Even Rush Limbaugh, the rightwing radio host who has an audience of 15 million and has been one of his fiercest critics, promised to support him on air from now on, referring to him as \"John McBrilliant\".</p> <p>Although politicians have been on the campaign trail for the past 20 months, the official election campaign only kicks off today with the end of the conventions. A CBS poll taken between Monday and Wednesday showed Obama's 8% lead at the weekend eroded and the two tied on 42%. The decisive moments that could determine the votes of swing voters could be the three presidential debates between Obama and McCain to be held in Mississippi, Tennessee and New York in the coming weeks.</p> <p>Michigan, one of the states worst affected by America's ailing economy, will be among the first stops by McCain and Palin today when they will hold a \"road to victory\" rally.</p> <p>Michigan contains the swing voters, often referred to as the Reagan Democrats, whom McCain has to bring into his camp to take the White House. Obama is also scheduled to visit battleground states today and over the weekend. Reflecting the importance of Michigan, the Democrats yesterday released a television ad to be broadcast in the state, featuring a petrol pump, with the price showing as $4.65 (\u00a32.62) - more than double what it was a year ago - below the name McCain-Bush.</p> <p>McCain pushed to increase his election coffers before he accepted the nomination yesterday. He is barred under campaign finance rules from fundraising once he accepts the nomination because he has opted to take $85m in public funding.</p> <p>But the campaign used a surge of excitement among the Republican grassroots to raise $47m in August - the highest monthly haul since McCain began his run.</p> <p>The last-minute infusion means that McCain could defy expectations and narrow the fundraising gap with Obama in the final stretch of the elections.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337287754\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1772820787_palin-analysis2-16x9.flv\"/> </video>   <p>A day after her prime-time television debut, Sarah Palin was yesterday hailed as the single most important unifying force behind the Republican presidential nominee, John McCain. The novelty of the self-described hunting, shooting and hockey mum, who also holds down a day job as a political reformer and governor of Alaska - has provided excitement and glamour to a campaign that formerly had trouble electrifying the Republican base.</p> <p>Now, after the party's rapturous response to Palin's speech on Wednesday night, its activists can claim their own rising young star to counter the Democratic party nominee, Barack Obama. </p> <p>\"To have a female vice-presidential nominee for the Republican party is very, very exciting,\" said Ellie Lopez-Bowlan, who heads a Republican women's group in Montrose, Nevada. \"She's refreshing in the fact that she's young, she's a working mother and she's a true conservative - I really appreciate that.\"</p> <p>It is unclear how Republicans will react to Palin once the novelty wears off, or whether they will forgive her a newcomer's mistakes on the campaign trail. But for the moment she is their rationale for going out to win the election for McCain.</p> <p>Republican enthusiasm for Palin has risen even after the questions about her experience, and the steady drip feed of stories about her personal life. Yesterday the McCain campaign furiously denied a National Enquirer story that Palin had had an affair, calling it a \"vicious lie\". \"The smearing of the Palin family must end,\" said a senior adviser, Steve Schmidt. </p> <p>As far as the McCain campaign is concerned, nothing will stop its plan to build on Palin's star role at the convention, deploying her in the white working class small towns around Detroit, Michigan, and the conservative bastion of Colorado Springs. Her first stop on Monday will be in Tampa, Florida.</p> <p>Palin pulls in two important demographics behind McCain: aged 44, she can connect with younger voters who supported his rivals in the Republican primaries, and she exercises a strong appeal to working mothers. She has also galvanised two key components of the Republican base that had been cool to McCain: fiscal conservatives and social conservatives.</p> <p>In her speech to the party convention Palin won wild applause when she talked up her record as a cost-cutting governor of Alaska who sold off the official plane on eBay and got rid of her taxpayer-funded official chef.</p> <p>\"She's something different - out of the box,\" said Mark Bloch, who heads the Wisconsin chapter of the free market organisation Americans for Prosperity. \"There was no enthusiasm before - no real reason to support McCain. There was nothing to fire up the grassroots.\"</p> <p>Palin also struck a chord with conservatives and Republican women by talking about her love for her pregnant daughter, Bristol, 17, and her five-month-old son, Trig, born with Down's syndrome.</p> <p>\"I could see immediately how she connects with working families and women who are raising children but also trying to give something back to the community,\" said Colleen Morrone, a mother of three from Pennsylvania. \"I'm definitely more enthusiastic now. It has changed the entire dynamic of the campaign.\" </p> <p>That is what the McCain campaign intended. The excitement she generated was precisely what it needed. After eight disillusioning years of George Bush, the Republican base was demoralised. Fiscal conservatives were angry at the $3 trillion cost of the Iraq war. Evangelicals felt that Bush had not done enough to put religion back in the public sphere. Neither group was thrilled with \"flip-flop\" McCain. </p> <p>McCain initially was preoccupied with trying to win over independent voters and Democrats who were not behind Obama. He shifted tack last month, using a presidential candidate's forum at a California mega-church to solidify his support among evangelicals by coming out strongly against abortion. Then came Palin. As Robin Moore, a telecom worker and delegate from Wisconsin, put it: \"With Palin, McCain has shown what it takes to be a conservative.\"</p>",
  "<p>The US vice-president, Dick Cheney, yesterday issued a direct challenge to Moscow's sway over Georgia, pledging Washington's support for its eventual membership of Nato, while denouncing Russia's \"illegitimate\" invasion. \"Georgia will be in our alliance,\" Cheney said after talks with President Mikheil Saakashvili. </p> <p>Cheney used his one-day visit to Georgia to reinforce battle lines in the increasingly direct struggle between Washington and Moscow for the upper hand along Russia's southern border. His visit to Azerbaijan, Georgia and Ukraine was aimed at stressing America's \"deep, abiding interest\" in the region, in response to the claim by Russia's president, Dmitry Medvedev, that Moscow had \"privileged interests\" in former Soviet states.</p> <p>The US challenge was undermined by the collapse of Ukraine's pro-western coalition on the eve of Cheney's arrival in Kiev at the end of his three-country trip yesterday. The crisis threatened to derail President Viktor Yushchenko's efforts to win Ukraine Nato and EU membership.</p> <p>Cheney made clear however that it would not shake Washington's deep involvement in the region, now focused on Georgia after last month's conflict with Russia over South Ossetia. </p> <p>Shrugging off Russian recognition of the breakaway republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, he declared the Bush administration's \"strong commitment to Georgia's territorial integrity\". The US would stand with Georgia, he said, \"as you work to overcome an invasion of your sovereign territory and an illegitimate attempt to change your country's borders by force\".</p> <p>He also made a point of reaffirming US support for Saakashvili, who Moscow has derided as \"a political corpse\". In pointed contrast, Cheney told the Georgian leader: \"You have been fearless in response to the occupation of your country and steadfast in your principles. We respect you.\" </p> <p>The two men made a joint appearance near an aircraft factory destroyed by Russian bombing, to watch a US military transport plane unload blankets, part of the $1bn in emergency aid the US has offered Georgia to help the country rebuild. The package makes Georgia the biggest recipient of US aid after Israel, Egypt and Iraq.</p> <p>US officials stressed the package did not include aid to rebuild Georgia's military. That will be decided later this year.</p> <p>Georgian membership of Nato is due to be discussed at an alliance ministerial meeting in December. Russia insisted yesterday that such a move remained a red line in east-west relations. Dmitry Rogozin, Russia's representative to Nato, said Moscow would respond by halting co-operation with Nato over Afghanistan. </p> <p>Cheney's trip coincided with the collapse of Ukraine's government after a split between Yushchenko and the prime minister, Yulia Tymoshenko. Their coalition collapsed over Russia's invasion of Georgia - with Tymoshenko positioning herself as a rival candidate to Yushchenko in Ukraine's presidential election next year. Yushchenko has lambasted Russia's occupation of Georgia, while Tymoshenko has refused to criticise the Kremlin directly.</p>",
  "<p>To some, Asif Ali Khan Zardari is a corrupt, bullying chancer who was a political liability for his late wife, Benazir Bhutto. To others, the 53-year-old politician is a likeable, experienced and sharp-witted middle-aged man who finally has his chance. For a few, he is all these things at once. One thing is sure: Zardari, who is expected to be elected Pakistan's new president tomorrow, is a highly controversial figure and seems unlikely to be the man who can unite 175 million fractious Pakistanis. </p> <p>\"His first approach is always to make friends - but you wonder when the fist might come out,\" said Najam Sethi, editor of several newspapers. \"He has a kind of natural intelligence and is very charming,\" said one neutral observer who has known Zardari since childhood. \"But it is difficult to know whether his charm is a highly effective act or quite how bright he actually is. He could just be doing a good impression of both.\"</p> <p>Such contradictions seem an integral part of the man. Zardari grew up in Karachi, Pakistan's southern port city, son of a landlord and unsuccessful cinema owner. As a teenager, he was known primarily for his skill at polo and driving fast, though his disregard for risk sometimes had a positive side. When riding one evening in the mid-1980s with an elite equestrian club on the outskirts of Karachi, a foreign diplomat's daughter rode into a dangerous swamp. \"About 50 people stood around watching as she sank into quicksand,\" a witness told the Guardian. \"Zardari waded in and hauled her out. He's brave.\"</p> <p>His arranged marriage in 1987 to Benazir Bhutto, the daughter of former Pakistani prime minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, surprised many and brought him into the central current of his nation's turbulent political life. A year later Bhutto led the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) to victory in elections after the military dictator Zia ul-Haq died in a mysterious plane crash. She promised \"food, shelter and clothes\" for the masses. Two years later, her administration was dismissed amid allegations of corruption and incompetence. Zardari was imprisoned on charges of blackmail.</p> <p>Over the next 14 years, Zardari alternated periods of liberty and incarceration. When the PPP regained power in 1993, Bhutto made her husband minister of investment, a controversial decision given the reputation for graft Zardari had acquired during the party's first stint in office. Through the early 1990s he collected a breathtaking range of allegations of corruption, implication in murder, attempted embezzlement and even drug trafficking.</p> <p>After a second, lengthier stint in prison following Bhutto's second fall from power, Zardari was released after lengthy negotiations between the PPP and General Pervez Musharraf, then in power, in 2004. Zardari dismisses the various charges as political smears and, now that Swiss magistrates who seized millions in accounts linked to Bhutto and her husband have dropped their investigations, there is not a single outstanding case against him. \"All through his time in prison he showed an incredible resilience,\" said one journalist who interviewed him repeatedly. \"He always seemed sure the tide would turn.\"</p> <p>No one doubts that Zardari is a survivor. Released in 2004, he kept a low profile, undergoing medical treatment in America and only getting involved in active politics shortly before his wife's return to Pakistan in October last year. His reappearance at strategy planning sessions in London dismayed many PPP stalwarts. Power has earned him more supporters, however. \"He's an older and wiser man. He's got health problems, he watches his diet, he doesn't drink any longer,\" said a Pakistani political activist. \"He and Benazir were both very young when they came to power. They made mistakes.\"</p> <p>A former close associate from the early 1990s spoke, with no obvious irony given the frequent charges of egregious nepotism levelled at Zardari, of how Bhutto's widower \"always goes out of his way to help out his friends and even those who somehow reach him for help for jobs, financial help etcetera\". But others describe an arrogant, uncultivated and often impatient man ruthless with his enemies. Some accuse Zardari of frequent personal abuse of subordinates. An ally who preferred to remain anonymous said: \"He is not a man you want to be on the wrong side of.\"</p> <p>Twenty years' experience has taught Zardari much about the brutal game of Pakistani politics. When his wife died, he moved swiftly to secure control of the PPP, sidelining his son and skilfully assuming the Bhutto mantle. However, Zardari is far from an intellectual and does not share his late wife's profound interest in geopolitics or economics, nor her education, eloquence or charisma.</p> <p>\"He doesn't read much, it's true,\" said an ally. \"But you don't necessarily need to be a bookworm type to be president of Pakistan.\" In the Zardari camp there is quiet jubilation. Few predicted this victory. Zardari will savour it.</p> <h2>CV</h2> <p><strong>Born</strong> July 26 1955 in Nawabshah, Pakistan</p> <p><strong>Family</strong> Married Benazir Bhutto in 1987 (she was assassinated in 2007), three children, Bilawal, Bakhtwar and Aseefa</p> <p><strong>Political career</strong> Member national assembly 1990-93 and 1993-96; federal minister of the environment 1993-1996; federal minister of investment 1995-96; transformed the power sector by encouraging investment opportunities.

  "<p>Only a week ago few people outside Alaska knew anything at all about Sarah Palin. Seven days on she has become the biggest hot-button political story in the English-speaking world, and her fame is rocketing. Hers is the name in the headline that guarantees a million website hits. But does all that make Palin the defining factor in November's US election? I don't think so.</p> <p>There has been a concerted attempt by the Republican machine in St Paul this week to trash the American media as being too liberal and too establishment to understand the Palin phenomenon. Maybe it is true that the first reflex in some of the political media was to dismiss her as an amateur, a gimmick or just a rightwing crazy. But the media are energised by stories, not ideology. The danger now, after the impact of her speech on Wednesday, is not that the media will underestimate Palin but that it will overestimate her.</p> <p>As Hurricane Sarah blasts through American politics, many lose their bearings and get the whole Palin thing out of proportion. That is nowhere more true than here in St Paul itself. Yes, she lit the touchpaper on a convention that had previously been a damp squib. But the overcompensation is absurd. It sometimes feels as though the selfsame people who at the start of the week were saying that Palin was certain to lose John McCain this election are now saying that she is certain to win it for - and in spite of - him.</p> <p>This is madness, short-termism and loss of judgment. Yesterday, post-Palin but pre-McCain, her convention debut was the only game in town. Did you see her? What did you think? Wasn't it electrifying? Today, post-McCain and pre-whatever the next thing is, Palin is already beginning to slip back into some sort of bigger and more considered context. Give it a week, give it a month, and it will all look rather different again.</p> <p>That doesn't in any way mean that Palin has not made a major impact. She is an exciting rightwing newcomer and modern democratic politics is far more receptive to good women leaders than some critics pretend, as the flawed Palin and the flawed Hillary Clinton have both proved. But this isn't a movie. This isn't Geena Davis in Commander in Chief. It isn't Jane Horrocks in The Amazing Mrs Pritchard. Palin is one important factor among several in this election, and the real challenge, especially here in the eye of the storm, is get her into some perspective.</p> <p>Karl Rove, who is entitled to be listened to with wary respect on such matters, said after her speech that Palin brought three things to the Republican ticket this year. She was, he said, a capable executive, she knew about energy policy, and she could attack with a smile on her face. She made a good populist pitch, he added, but she might have been unwise to keep the Palin family issues in play without absolutely nailing them. It was a pretty sober assessment by an arch-partisan. There was no hint there that this was a transformative candidacy or that the old rules suddenly no longer applied.</p> <p>Indeed, if you probe Rove's three positives, none of them stands up particularly well to scrutiny. Palin may be a competent executive, but two terms as mayor of a town of 10,000 people followed by 18 months as governor of America's third least populated state do not add up to conclusive proof that she is ready to lead the country. She may indeed know about energy policy - it was one of the more substantial parts of her speech - but she is also a driller from a pro-drilling party that is heavily financed by drillers and she said not one word on Wednesday about climate change. Even in gas-guzzling America, that is not self-evidently a populist pitch.</p> <p>Palin can certainly attack. That line about being a pitbull in lipstick was a cracker. You knew instantly where the Sarah Barracuda tag came from. And she proved it in the speech too, with sharp, brutal blows about Barack Obama's years as a community organiser, about his disdain for guns and religion, and about the Styrofoam Greek columns of his Denver acceptance speech. But will either male or female voters want a long-term relationship with a political dominatrix from the Arctic? That's another question.</p> <p>Do not, in any case, exaggerate the importance of the running mate in American presidential elections. Traditionally, the role of the number two on the ticket is to carry their own state, to attack the other party's presidential nominee, and to do well in the televised vice-presidential debate. Palin looks well equipped to do all three. As well as Alaska, she will play well in swing states such as Nevada and New Mexico. But even if she does well against Joe Biden on October 2, how much will it matter? By far the most celebrated knock-out blow in a veep debate in modern times was delivered by Lloyd Bentsen on Dan Quayle in 1988. Yet who ended up in the White House? </p> <p>In the short term, Palin's unquestionable achievement is to have energised a Republican convention and a Republican base that remains uneasy about McCain. Hers was the sort of speech that George Bush, at his best, could do with great effect. Yet it would be a mistake to cast Palin simply as a social conservative from central casting, bent on reviving the culture wars of the 1990s - even though, in some respects, that is the effect of her candidacy.</p> <p>There was a smarter framing of Palin's candidacy in the New York Times this week by the conservative columnist David Brooks. Palin, he suggested, is that rarest of beings - an American politician who sees the world in the same way as McCain sees it. As with McCain, the thing that seems to make Palin get up in the morning is the desire to root out corruption and selfishness. Like him, she is less interested in the left-right or identity prism than in the crusade of virtue against vice. The problem, says Brooks, is that a McCain-Palin administration would be light on pragmatism and deal-making. It could all be a recipe for glorious failure.</p> <p>If that is right, or even half-right, it is a necessary reminder that this election is not about Palin. The contest is between a candidate who wants to break with Bush's policies and one who wants to break with his instincts. It is between Obama and McCain and, though there is still all to play for, it very much remains Obama's to lose.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martin.kettle@theguardian.com\">martin.kettle@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Professor John Hobbs, who has died aged 79 following a year-long struggle against lung cancer, was a physician and teacher at the forefront of research in clinical immunology, protein biochemistry and bone marrow transplantation. In addition to his numerous clinical achievements, he helped to set up the world's first unrelated bone marrow donor register. This groundbreaking system, which was later named after Anthony Nolan, established the future use of unrelated donors to patients, so far for more than 10,000 people. The initiative was a blueprint that would be copied around the world. </p> <p>Hobbs also founded, and raised funds for, the Cogent Trust (named from COrrection of GENeTic diseases by Transplantation) to disseminate knowledge about transplantation for genetic diseases and to sponsor research and clinical work. His most profound legacy, however, may lie in the fruits of the labours of the scores of researchers who benefited from his tutelage over many years. Many of them now hold senior positions in university and hospital pathology laboratories. </p> <p>Hobbs was born into a military family in Aldershot, the third of four boys. After a peripatetic childhood, because of his father's army career, the family eventually settled in his father's home town of Plymouth. During the second world war, Hobbs and his brothers were evacuated to Penzance. He left school at 16 and worked as a pathology laboratory assistant. </p> <p>After national service in Egypt with the Royal Army Medical Corps, he attended Plymouth and Devonport Technical College, where he achieved an external inter BSc within nine months. He then gained a state scholarship to study medicine, at the Middlesex hospital in London, where he won seven prizes - proof of the lively, inquisitive and perceptive intellect that was to characterise his lifelong work in academic laboratory medicine. </p> <p>As a senior registrar at Hammersmith hospital, where he was appointed consultant in 1963, Hobbs developed his interest in protein biochemistry. Seminal publications in myeloma (a tumour of the bone marrow) and immunoglobulins established him as an authority and led to his appointment in 1970 to the chair of chemical pathology at the Westminster medical school. He soon created a lively department in which research and development thrived alongside diagnostic laboratory biochemistry. Their work in serum proteins indicated that detection of abnormal forms or quantities could provide markers for the diagnosis of disease. The technical skills needed to detect them were not available in all laboratories and he was instrumental, with others in endocrinology and trace metal analysis, in forming a group of specialised laboratories to provide a nationwide Supraregional Assay Service, much of which still functions.</p> <p>It was at the Westminster hospital that Hobbs began the work that was to give him the most satisfaction and pride, as here he met Joe Humble, who had been fascinated by the potential of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in humans since the 1950s. The timing was perfect, as Robert Good, at the University of Minnesota, had performed the first successful BMT for a severe immunodeficiency disease in 1968. Hobbs saw the potential and drove his team to establish a series of medical breakthroughs: the first unfractionated bone marrow sibling graft for severe primary immunodeficiency in a seven-month-old girl in 1971; the first father-to-son transplant in 1972; and the first volunteer, unrelated-donor BMT in 1973 (for a patient with chronic granulomatous disease). </p> <p>The insight for which Hobbs will be forever remembered, however, came in 1980 from a fusion of his biochemical training and transplantation expertise. Experimental evidence that immune cells travelling through the bloodstream into tissues could deliver deficient enzymes suggested the potential use of BMT for treating a wide range of genetic diseases. By the following year, he and his colleague, Ken Hugh-Jones, were able to report remarkable improvements (although sadly not a complete cure) after transplantation for the devastating disease Hurler's syndrome. As a result, throughout the 1980s children came from all over the world for BMT for many enzyme deficiencies. By 1992 the team at the Westminster children's hospital had performed 285 transplants in an array of haematological and enzyme diseases.</p> <p>Two other innovations by Hobbs contributed to furthering BMT. Firstly, a donor needs to be \"tissue matched\" to the patient. In many cases an unrelated donor needs to be found. He collaborated with Dr David James, the tissue typing specialist, to establish a register of potential donors, responding to Shirley Nolan's search for a donor for her son, Anthony, who died of his serious immunodeficiency disease in 1979 before a donor was found. The registry grew into today's Anthony Nolan Trust, one of the world's largest panels. </p> <p>Secondly, pioneering BMT programmes would be expensive and unlikely to be supported by the NHS. Hobbs campaigned with others, notably Iris Burton, editor of Woman's Own magazine, Emma Nicholson, the Liberal Democrat peer, and the Save the Children Fund to raise more than \u00a33m to build dedicated isolation cubicles at the Westminster children's hospital and to support patients, parents and nursing staff. This fund later became the Cogent Trust. Hobbs was devastated to learn that the bone marrow unit would not be transferred to the new Chelsea and Westminster hospital on the closure of the old Westminster hospital in 1992. He never forgave those responsible for the decision. </p> <p>Never downcast for long, Hobbs threw his energies into work with the Cogent Trust, which raised \u00a313m between 1971 and 2007 to disseminate knowledge about transplantation for genetic diseases and to sponsor research and clinical work. He particularly admired work in unrelated donor transplantation at the Bristol Royal hospital for children, and in Hurler's syndrome and related mucopolysaccharide diseases at Manchester children's hospital. Cogent funds enabled the training of consultants at both hospitals, assisted the building of a new transplant unit in Bristol and sponsored research to make transplantation increasingly safe and effective.</p> <p>Hobbs could appear to strangers as a challenging person, but those of us who knew him well understood that this characteristic stemmed from a striving for excellence. To us he was a moral, compassionate person who took delight in scientific achievement, gave unbending support to all those who trained in his department, and held an absolute belief in his work and the sanctity of every human life.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife Patricia, his daughters Wendy, Lucy and Trudy, his grandchildren and two brothers, William and Dennis.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> John Raymond Hobbs, physician, born April 17 1929; died July 13 2008</p>",
  "<p>How tame does the Dick Cheney lesbian daughter plotline look now?

Yes. We. Can.</p> <p>Welcome to the next phase of Decision 2008: the child-star cliches speak! Over the next few paragraphs, we're going to hear from emerging punditry force Lindsay Lohan - and learn how that other Red State teen mom, Jamie Lynn Spears, is supporting Bristol via the medium of burpcloths. But first to Lohan, whose recent embrace of popular mid-noughties social life simulator MySpace has marked her as quite the commentator to watch.</p> <p>\"I am concerned with the fact that Sarah Palin brought the attention to her daughter's pregnancy,\" thunders the PJ O'Rourke of the West Hollywood bar circuit, \"rather than all world issues and what she believes she could possibly do to change them - if elected. I get Sarah Palin's views against abortion, but I would much prefer to hear more about what she can do for our country rather than how her daughter is going to have a child no matter what.\"</p> <p>Oh Linds, I think Sarah would much prefer to be talking about those things too, rather than having to feed her trampy daughter and her jock boyfriend into the GOP happy-ending machine. Which, let's face it, has been known to malfunction.</p> <p>And so to the Spears clan, who chose this week to offer the first glimpse of which way they might swing come November. To wit: Spears minor, Jamie Lynn, has shown sisterly support to Bristol in the form of unsolicited baby-shower gifts. Sixty dollars worth of \"pink burpcloths\", to be precise, which store sources say were ordered from an overpriced Hollywood baby boutique, and dispatched to the governor's mansion with the note: \"Dear Bristol, Hang in there! XOXO Jamie Lynn Spears.\"</p> <p>How this associative branding will pan out is impossible to say. Let's just accept that the battle for America's soul is officially on, and look forward to further celebrity interventions as and when.</p>",
  "<p>Via Americablog I see that the McCain campaign <a href=\"http://www.americablog.com/2008/09/mccain-campaign-palin-wont-do-any.html\">has declared</a> that Sarah Palin won't do interviews. </p> <p>This is one of the least surprising announcements I've ever heard, but even so, imagine the cynicism here. They know she can't answer questions about the country, the world and policy. So they shield her. And in doing so, they will simply say, the press is out to get her etc etc, and the right-wing base will say rah rah. What, you say? A person who wants to be vice-president to a 72-year-old cancer survivor ought to be able to demonstrate a modicum of command of policy detail? Now you're just being silly.</p> <p>The answer is here simple. The major media should say: Until she agrees to interviews, and we mean not one or two with Fox News and The Washington Times, but a normal and respectable amount of access, we won't cover her speeches.

  "<p>On August 22, the American Corn Growers Association endorsed Barack Obama for the presidency. It was only the second time in the group's 21-year history that it has endorsed a candidate for the White House. The corn growers <a href=\"http://www.acga.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=102&amp;Itemid=42\">said</a> they like Obama because he supports agriculture and \"the expansion of renewable energy such as advanced ethanol\" and other renewable sources.</p> <p>But don't expect to see any prominent mentions of that endorsement on BarackObama.com. Nor should you expect to hear Obama use the word \"ethanol\" between now and election day. Indeed, over the past few months, as the reports on corn ethanol's environmental and food price impacts have gone from bad to awful, Obama has been scurrying away from his record as one of the Senate's most reliable corn ethanol boosters. </p> <p>Over the past few weeks, the Obama campaign has refused to answer questions about Obama's support for the federal ethanol mandates, and the candidate's website has been purged of his old energy platform, which included several lines about his plans to increase ethanol production in the US. </p> <p>But try as they might, neither Obama nor his running mate, Joe Biden, can shake the smell of corn alcohol. And that may provide an opening for Obama's opponent, John McCain, who has long been one of the Senate's loudest ethanol critics. McCain briefly switched sides on ethanol in the months prior to the Iowa caucuses. But he is now one of a dozen Republican senators who are pushing <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/~hutchison/pr051908a.html\">a bill would freeze the volume of corn ethanol</a> to be blended into gasoline at no more than 9 billion gallons per year.</p> <p>In 2006, Obama, along with four other farm-state senators, sent a letter to President Bush urging him to ignore calls to reduce the $0.54 per-gallon tariff on imports of Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol. During his first year in office, Obama twice used corporate jets belonging to the Illinois-based agribusiness giant, Archer Daniels Midland Co, one of America's biggest ethanol producers. In January 2007, Obama along with two other farm-state senators, Tom Harkin, an Iowa Democrat, and Indiana Republican Richard Lugar, introduced a bill called the American Fuels Act of 2007, which was aimed at promoting ethanol consumption. Touting the bill, <a href=\"http://obama.senate.gov/press/070105-legislation_to_1/\">Obama said</a>: \"To become truly energy independent, we need not only to increase domestic production of renewable fuels like ethanol.\"</p> <p>Like Obama, Biden has long been a staunch ethanol booster. He has supported legislation aimed at requiring oil companies to retrofit their service stations with pumps capable of dispensing E85, a blend of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline, and legislation aimed at forcing automakers to produce cars capable of burning E85. Biden has <a href=\"http://biden.senate.gov/issues/issue/?id=0cc59be1-a50d-4e0f-952e-57931f6e4d62\">declared</a> that the US \"should increase the amount of ethanol and biodiesel included in the nation's fuel supply by extending and increasing\" the federal mandates that require American refiners to add ethanol to their gasoline. (Under current federal rules, US oil refiners must be using at least 15bn gallons of ethanol per year in their gasoline by 2015. Nearly all of that will be made from corn.) </p> <p>The huge increases in corn ethanol production are affecting food prices. At least 10 studies have found that US corn ethanol production is affecting prices at the supermarket. An April 8 i<a href=\"http://image.theguardian.com/sys-files/Environment/documents/2008/07/10/Biofuels.PDF\">nternal report from the World Bank </a>said that the price surge \"was caused by a confluence of factors but the most important was the large increase in biofuels production in the US and EU.\" In mid-July, Consumer Price Index data showed that over the previous three months, US food prices increased at an annualized rate if 8% - one of the biggest increases in recent history. </p> <p>Clean air advocates contend that the increasing use of ethanol in gasoline is increasing the amount of smog in America's cities. A spate of studies has shown that the production of corn ethanol likely creates more greenhouse gases than conventional gasoline.</p> <p>For Obama, fighting corn ethanol would mean cutting subsidies to corn farmers in his home state. In 2006 alone, according to data from the <a href=\"http://farm.ewg.org/farm/progdetail.php?fips=00000&amp;yr=2006&amp;progcode=corn&amp;page=states\">Environmental Working Group</a>, Illinois farmers received corn subsidies totalling $752.4m, making Illinois second only to Iowa in total federal corn handouts. And <a href=\"http://www.neo.ne.gov/statshtml/121.htm\">Illinois ranks third</a> among the states in ethanol production capacity, behind only Iowa and Nebraska.</p> <p>Taking \"change\" to Washington - the Obama campaign's mantra - will require fighting agriculture subsidies. But Obama voted for this year's farm bill, a $307bn package stuffed with yet more subsidies. Between 1995 and 2006, federal corn subsidies, which are provided through a myriad of programmes, totalled $56.1bn. That's <a href=\"http://farm.ewg.org/farm/region.php?fips=00000#topprogs\">more than twice the amount</a> given to any other agricultural commodity, including American mainstays like wheat and cotton, and 105 times more than was paid to tobacco farmers.</p> <p>Over the past few months, Obama has repeatedly worked to paint McCain, who favours more domestic drilling for oil and gas, as a handmaiden of Big Oil. That's an interesting charge given that Obama has spent much of his tenure in the Senate carrying water for Big Corn.</p>",
  "<p>Over the past 20 months of campaigning Barack Obama's team has built a reputation for discipline: the inner circle decides on a message, passes it down and everyone sticks to it. But since John McCain announced his running mate last Friday, the Obama team has shown rare uncertainty about how to deal with the Sarah Palin phenomenon.</p> <p>\"They blew it. This was not good,\" a prominent Democrat who preferred to remain anonymous said Thursday, reflecting the mood of many Democrats. He said that the anti-George Bush tide in the country will be enough to see Obama into the White House but the presence of Palin will make it closer.</p> <p>He felt Obama's team and the media had walked into a Republican mousetrap by demonstrating class and gender prejudice against a modern woman from a middle-class background.</p> <p>The initial reaction on Friday from the Obama team was to criticise McCain for picking someone with so little experience but a few hours later there was a more courteous response in a joint statement from Obama and his vice-presidential running mate, Joe Biden, welcoming as historic the Republicans first female vice-presidential candidate.</p> <p>Obama's team then joined in the hunt through her background. On top of that, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, Joe Biden referred to her as \"good looking\", a comment that many women voters may regard as patronising, before Thursday describing her speech as lacking in substance.</p> <p>The latter is the approach that many Democrats thought the Obama team should have taken from the start, presenting the Republicans as the tired old party, short of ideas, and contrasting this with the Democratic programme.</p> <p>Tad Devine, who was chief strategist for Democratic candidate John Kerry's unsuccessful run for the presidency in 2004, said Thursday: \"I think the best way to respond would be to point out that she said practically nothing about the biggest issue of our time,\" Devine said, listing the economy, the Iraq war and the health service.<br>\"I think they should refrain from anything personal.\"</p> <p>Devine, like other Democrats, feels that the impact of Palin will quickly diminish. \"I think in the end this election will come down to McCain and Obama, as they always do,\" he said.</p> <p>Polls in the past have shown that vice-presidential picks have little influence on the final outcome, even one as controversial as the Republican Dan Quayle in 1988.</p> <p>The focus should shift back to Obama and McCain on the campaign trail and, in particular, the three presidential debates between them later this month and next.</p> <p>Vice-presidents are normally only prominent at three points in a campaign: when chosen, their convention speech and the vice-presidential debate. When Biden comes up against her at the debate, he has to balance a desire to show off his experience of foreign affairs against her limited knowledge against coming across as patronising.</p> <p>The task for the Democrats is to stop her winning over women. If Hillary Clinton had been the vice-presidential pick, that would have helped, but in her absence, they could - if they feel they have to keep it personal - focus on her social conservatism: anti-abortion and creationism.</p> <p>Devine said he thought that it was legitimate for Obama to keep looking at how she was appointed by McCain, with the vetting taking place only the day before, describing this as \"shoddy\" and \"outrageous\" on the part of McCain.</p> <p>He also thought that while Palin's speech would appeal to the Republican base, it might not play well with the independents that McCain needs to win over to secure the White House.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337287754\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1772820787_palin-analysis2-16x9.flv\"/> </video>   <p>A day after her prime time television debut, Sarah Palin today was hailed as the single most important unifying force behind the Republican, John McCain.</p> <p>The sheer novelty of Palin -- a self-described hunting, shooting hockey mum who also holds down a day job as a political reformer in the vast state of Alaska -- has provided excitement and glamour to a campaign that had had trouble electrifying the Republican base.</p> <p>Now after the Republicans' rapturous response to Palin's speech on Wednesday night, party activists can claim their own rising young star to counter the Democrats' Barack Obama.</p> <p>\"To have a female vice-presidential nominee for the Republican party is very, very exciting,\" said Ellie Lopez-Bowlan, who heads a Republican women's group in Montrose, Nevada. \"She's refreshing in the fact that she's young, she's a working mother, and she's a true conservative -- I really appreciate that.\"</p> <p>It's unclear how Republicans will react to Palin once the newness wears off, or whether they will forgive her a newcomer's mistakes on the campaign trail. But for the moment she is their rationale for going out to win the election for McCain.</p> <p>Republican enthusiasm for Palin has gone up even further with the questions about her experience, and the steady drip feed of stories about her personal life. Thursday, the campaign issued a furious denial of a National Enquirer story that Palin had had an affair, calling it a \"vicious lie\". \"The smearing of the Palin family must end,\" said a senior adviser, Steve Schmidt.</p> <p>The McCain campaign plans to build on Palin's star role at the convention, deploying her in the white working class small towns around Detroit, Michigan and the conservative bastion of Colorado Springs. Her first stop on Monday will be in Tampa, Florida.</p> <p>Palin pulls in two important demographics behind McCain: at 44 she can connect with younger voters who supported his rivals in the Republican primary. She exercises a strong appeal to working mothers.</p> <p>The Alaska governor has also galvanised two key components of the Republican base that have so far been cool to McCain: fiscal and social conservatives.</p> <p>In her speech on Wednesday night, Palin won wild applause when she talked up her record as a cost-cutting governor who sold off the official plane on eBay, and got rid of the tax-payer funded chef.</p> <p>\"She's something different -- out of the box,\" said Mark Bloch, who heads the Wisconsin chapter of the free market organisation, Americans for Prosperity. \"There was no enthusiasm before -- no real reason to support McCain. There was nothing to fire up the grassroots.\"</p> <p>Palin also struck a chord with social conservatives and Republican women by talking about her love for her pregnant daughter, Bristol, 17, and her son, Trig, 5 months, who was born with Down's syndrome.</p> <p>\"To me I could see immediately how she connects with working families, and women who are raising children but also trying to give something back to the community,\" said Colleen Morrone, a mother of three from Pennsylvania who works for Goodwill. \"I'm definitely more enthusiastic now. It has changed the entire dynamic of the campaign.\"</p> <p>That is of course what the McCain campaign intended. Though Palin breaks the mould of Republican women, her introduction to the faithful this week has been scripted - down to the seating plan on the convention floor.</p> <p>American political conventions are all about firing up the party activists, and sending those enthusiastic troops out onto the election trail.</p> <p>The convention's use of Palin in this regard hewed to that formula, with Republican leaders and operatives using the first two days of the convention to rouse the political troops around the Alaska governor.</p> <p>Before she even stepped on stage at the convention, activists were chanting \"Sarah, Sarah\" and waving made-to-look homemade signs saying \"Palin power\". Convention organisers also moved the women delegates from Florida -- where Palin will appear next week -- right up in front of the stage, and gave them orange scarves to wave.</p> <p>That excitement was precisely what McCain needed as he goes into the elections.</p> <p>After eight disillusioning years of George Bush, the Republican base was demoralised.</p> <p>Fiscal conservatives were angry at the $3 trillion cost of the Iraq war. Evangelicals felt Bush, though a born again Christian, had not done enough to put religion back in the public sphere.</p> <p>Neither group was thrilled with McCain. \"They feel like he has never been in the conservative camp and he sort of flip-flops,\" said Ron Paul, who led a breakaway libertarian movement during the Republican primary. \"I think they don't see him as a firm believer. The conservatives have learned to mistrust him.\"</p> <p>McCain initially was preoccupied with trying to win over independent voters and Democrats who are not behind Obama -- rather than activating the grassroots.</p> <p>He shifted tack last month, using a presidential candidate's forum at a California mega-church to solidify his support among evangelicals by coming out strongly against abortion.</p> <p>Evangelical leaders describe the forum as a turning point in their support for McCain. \"My general impression is that he has been doing increasingly well with evangelicals,\" said Leith Anderson, president of the national association of evangelicals. \"I think that evangelicals have appreciated his overtures and his conversations, and his inclusion of evangelicals in the dialogue.\"</p> <p>Then came Palin, with her uncompromising stand against abortion, even in cases of rape or incest, and her support for the teaching of creationism in schools.</p> <p>Palin is certainly the story of the moment -- she is the cover story on a slew of magazines this week. But as November approaches, Republicans are likely to see Palin as a reflection of McCain and his judgment rather than an entirely independent entity.</p> <p>As Robin Moore, a telecom worker and delegate from Wisconsin put it: \"With Palin, John McCain has shown what it takes to be a conservative.\"</p>",

In his introduction, controversial evangelical Pastor Ed Kalnins noted that when he first met Palin, she was the mayor of the town:</p> <blockquote> <p>When I got the chance to meet our mayor, I said: \"This person loves Jesus. That's the bottom line. She loves Jesus with everything she has. She's a disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ before she's a mayor.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>After boasting that her 19-year-old son Track had enlisted in the military and was about to be deployed to Iraq, Palin said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Pray for our military men and women who are striving to do what is right. Also, for this country, that our leaders, our national leaders, are sending [US soldiers] out on a task that is from God. \u2026 That's what we have to make sure that we're praying for, that there is a plan and that that plan is God's plan.</p> </blockquote> <p>Subsequently, she spoke about a $30bn natural gas pipeline that she's seeking to build from Alaska through Canada to the lower 48 states:</p> <blockquote> <p>I can work really, really hard to get a natural gas pipeline, a $30bn project that's going to create a lot of new jobs for Alaskans and will have a lot of energy flowing through here. And pray about that also. I think God's will has to be done in unifying people and companies to get that gas line built, so pray for that.</p> </blockquote> <p>Then, after listing the tasks she can do as governor to make the state a decent place to live, she added:</p> <blockquote> <p>None of that is gonna do any good if the people's heart isn't right with God. We can work together to make sure that God's will be done here in Alaska.</p> </blockquote> <p>After watching this video, I can perfectly understand why evangelicals are overjoyed with her nomination. But I can't understand why McCain was as well. Did he not think that statements like this might disturb non-evangelicals, not to mention non-Christians, of which, believe it or not, there are a few in this country?</p> <p>Religiously, Sarah Palin is George Bush unbuttoned. The latter manages much of the time to disguise the evangelical passion of his political mission. Palin possesses the same zeal, but lays it on the line for all to see. There is no artifice, no subtlety. It's all right there. If this woman is right for the vice-presidency, then evangelical Christianity is even more pervasive and powerful than I feared.</p> <p>Frankly, candidates like Palin are the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0908/Jewish_Republicans_try_to_read_Palin_tea_leaves.html\">Jews' worst nightmare</a>. The sentiments she expresses are part of a vestigial memory we internalise about what intolerance and bigotry sounds like. This certainly doesn't rise to the level of flat-out anti-Semitism. But we know when we're not wanted, and as non-believers we're not wanted in the evangelical Christian worldview, except as enablers of Jesus' final coming.</p> <p>The Politico's Ben Smith reports that only two weeks ago, Palin attended her local church to hear Jews for Jesus executive director David Brickner <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0908/13098.html\">excoriate Jews for not accepting Him</a> as their Lord and saviour:</p> <blockquote> <p>Brickner's mission has drawn wide criticism from the organised Jewish community, and the Anti-Defamation League accused them in a report of \"targeting Jews for conversion with subterfuge and deception\".</p> <p>Brickner ... described terrorist attacks on Israelis as God's \"judgment of unbelief\" of Jews who haven't embraced Christianity. </p> <p>\"Judgment is very real and we see it played out on the pages of the newspapers and on the television. It's very real. When [Brickner's son] was in Jerusalem he was there to witness some of that judgment, some of that conflict, when a Palestinian from East Jerusalem took a bulldozer and went plowing through a score of cars, killing numbers of people. Judgment - you can't miss it.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>I'm not going to make the same mistake anti-Obamaites made in attributing the Rev Jeremiah Wright's views to Obama by attributing Brickner's views to Palin. But I think it's entirely legitimate to ask what she was doing there while a speaker Jews view as anathema was expressing such ideas. And it's appropriate to insist that she not participate in such forums in the future and that she dissociate herself from the views she heard that day.</p> <p>We are a minority who, in a way, lives on the kindness of strangers, to quote Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire. In the evangelical world that Palin embraces there is little kindness for Jews.</p> <p>Until now, McCain enjoyed the highest poll ratings of a Republican presidential candidate in a long time (around 32%). No longer. With Palin on his ticket he can kiss a good deal of that Jewish vote goodbye. Sure, he'll still retain 20-25% of the hardcore true believers. But forget the rest. Smith also writes about an email he received from the Republican Jewish Coalition touting Palin as a friend of Israel because her office has an Israeli flag on the wall:</p> <blockquote> <p>The fact that this tiny image [of the Israeli flag] is the best the official voice of Republican Jewry has to defend Palin is a mark that McCain may have just helped solve Obama's Jewish problem.</p> </blockquote> <p>On Tuesday, MSNBC reported that Palin, chaperoned by Joe Lieberman, had her <a href=\"http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/09/02/1327325.aspx\">first pro forma meeting with Aipac's national board of directors</a> at her Minneapolis hotel, where the campaign has sequestered her:</p> <blockquote> <p>A campaign official ... said [the meeting] was geared towards putting the American Jewish community at ease over her understanding of US-Middle East relations. </p> <p>\"That's obviously going to be an issue,\" the aide said. \"It's not like being the senator from New York, obviously. But these aren't issues that are off her radar.\" </p> <p>Palin \u2026 expressed her \"heartfelt support for Israel\" and spoke of the threats it faces from Iran and others, the campaign official said. </p> <p>\"We had a good productive discussion on the importance of the US-Israel relationship, and we were pleased that governor Palin expressed her deep, personal, and lifelong commitment to the safety and well-being of Israel,\" Aipac spokesman Josh Block said. \"Like senator McCain, the vice-presidential nominee understands and believes in the special friendship between the two democracies and would work to expand and deepen the strategic partnership in a McCain/Palin administration.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>This is clearly boilerplate stuff. And you'll notice that the story was fed to the press by spokespeople instead of the candidate herself. This is a further indication of nervousness on the campaign's part in having Palin present her own views on the issue.</p> <p>Clearly, McCain's people worry that Palin has as little understanding of Israel as she has of other major foreign policy issues. It would be legitimate to question whether, at this point, she gets many issues of concern to the Jewish community. Her evangelical background isn't going to help persuade Jews otherwise.</p> <p>This is through no fault of her own. But the fault lies with McCain, who chose Palin without thinking through the impact this would have on his campaign in the Jewish community.</p>",
  "<p>If Obama's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/29/barackobama.democrats20081\">convention speech</a>, with the white columns in the huge stadium was grand opera, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/04/uselections2008.sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin's was soap opera</a>. The message was not that we should overlook her inexperience, but rejoice in it. We should vote for her because she was a hockey mom. The content of her speech was dumbed down in a way that was exquisitely handcrafted.</p> <p>In the hall, the audience was festooned with folksy placards handcrafted by the same sophisticated but ultimately stupid whiz-kids who put the <a href=\"http://bastardlogic.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/mission-accomplished.jpg\">Mission Accomplished banner</a> on the USS Lincoln five long years ago. The crowd is different, however. At a Republican convention there is always an undercurrent of bitterness and anger, a readiness to boo at the mention of, for example, community organising, or Senate democratic majority leader Harry Reid, or chant \"<a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2008/09/03/steele-gives-gop-delegates-new-cheer-drill-baby-drill/?mod=googlenews_wsj\">Drill baby, drill</a>\", as the crowd offers to drive their gas-guzzlers over all obstacles.</p> <p>Of course, the crowd had been primed for bitterness by none other than New York's own Napoleon, the bitter and vicious Rudy Giuliani who always gives the impression of payback time for perennial bullying in his schoolboy days. However, any crowd that cheers Giuliani for celebrating McCain's response to Putin's Cossack raid into Georgia, \"We are all Georgians,\" is not up for cerebration. Whose big talking got the Georgians into that predicament? And is McCain in a refugee camp with Russian tanks stopping him from moving about his own country?</p> <p>Technically, Palin's speech was not a patch on Obama's. I ran it past the reading level test on the spell checker. His had come in at a reading level of fourth grade, with no passives. Hers was a reading level of over ninth grade with six per cent of passives. Strangely, although she was clearly intended to evoke the solidarity votes of small town America, her speech writers, Bush's hand-me-downs, were worried about her pronunciation, and spelt out some difficult words for her on the teleprompter: \"habber-dasher\" for haberdasher, \"new-clear\" for nuclear to avert the Bushian \"noocoolear.\"</p> <p>However, even if the style was higher than Obama's, the content was not. It was aimed at people of faith, who could believe in three impossible things before breakfast. Her speechwriter <a href=\"http://www.matthewscully.com/\">Matthew Scully</a> wrote a book about the ethical treatment of animals, which is perhaps why his residual ethics eschewed any mention of shooting wolves from aircraft that may have sullied the hockey mum image. Nor indeed did he mention that her enthusiasm for hockey led her to <a href=\"http://current.com/items/89268486_as_mayor_hard_core_fiscal_conservative_sarah_palin_left_wasilla_20_million_in_debt\">increase the local sales tax</a> \u2013 including on food \u2013 to build an ice-hockey stadium so that her son could indulge his passion closer to home.</p> <p>The speech was almost certainly inspired by <a href=\"http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/H._L._Mencken\">HL Mencken</a>'s thought: \"On some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart's desire at last, and the White House will be adorned by a downright moron\". But that is unfair. Both she and her speechwriters are very clever, and unscrupulous, and they want to make her fit that role. They are basing their campaign on the premise that the American electorate wants a president on the edge of Alzheimer's and a vice-president who is auditioning for a part in a schmaltzy soap opera.</p> <p>She mentioned, to cheers that her husband was a proud member of the United Steelworkers Union, she glided over pathological Republican attempts to crush unions, and inhibit their organising efforts. But then, nor did she mention her <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1837918,00.html\">run-in with the town librarian</a> (surely along with the little red school house, an American icon) over censorship, her attempts to promote creationism, her belief that God wants federal funding for Alaskan pipelines, her doubts about global warming, or her pursuit of personal family feuds against public employees. This is a serious omission, and almost perplexing since it could prove that she may indeed be a worthy successor to Dick Cheney as a vice-president, and indeed a better shot, hitting wolves rather than colleagues. But then, Cheney wasn't mentioned either.</p> <p>Her balancing budgets may have been helped by a $1,000 per head per annum pork-barrelling operation from federal funds for her small town, helped by <a href=\"http://www.adn.com/news/politics/fbi/stevens/story/499537.html\">Senator Ted Stevens</a>, one of the \"good ol' boys\" she was supposed to have cleaned out, but who is currently campaigning for re-election even as he faces Federal corruption charges.</p> <p>She complained that Obama did not mention victory. But if pressed, she might have to explain why diverting troops from the search for Bin Laden in Afghanistan to Iraq and bogging down in both places occasioned mention for victory. Almost as eloquent in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/04/uselections2008.georgebush\">deafening sound of silence was any reference to President Bush,</a> which is surely churlish. The USA has had eight years of the policies she was prescribing \u2013 and is teetering on the edge of an economic catastrophe, but she just ignored it.</p> <p>Polls suggest that the American public oppose almost every one of Palin's concealed policies. This speech casts the forthcoming telection as an IQ test for the American electorate. If it fails, I foresee long lines outside Canadian and European consulates as the elite (anyone with an IQ over a 100) tries to get out.</p>",
  "<p>Top woman Democrats today struck back at Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin, saying her prime-time address to the Republican convention last night was short on economic proposals they say will move the election.</p> <p>In a conference call with reporters, Kansas governor Kathleen Sebelius and Florida congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz praised her delivery of the red-meat speech, but said it would leave woman voters, a group the Republicans are keen to attract, feeling unsatisfied.</p> <p>The two sought to portray Palin as an empty suit who presents well on television but lacks, or at least did last night, productive policy ideas. That is a reversal of Republican attacks on Democratic nominee Barack Obama, whom Republicans routinely praise for his eloquence while battering him.</p> <p>\"Governor Palin did a good job last night delivering a good speech in a tough arena,\" Sebelius said, adding, \"she mastered the words written by a Bush speechwriter\". She later added, \"the women who I know who were listening last night\u2026 were proud of the fact that she delivered her lines very well\".<br>Schultz said, \"I only heard from Sarah Palin's voice last night negative partisan attacks. There was no substance there was no vision of where she thinks the country should go.\"</p> <p>Schultz belittled Palin's effort to present herself as a reform politician, a key component of the Republican message in an election year in which President Bush is among the least popular presidents in US history.</p> <p>\"If her best example of being a reformer is selling the state's plane on e-Bay that's not my definition of reform,\" and not America's, she said.</p> <p>Last night Palin, who presided over the city hall in Wasilla, Alaska before becoming governor in 2006, presented herself as a small-town mayor in touch with American values. </p> <p>Sebelius today mocked the effort, while simultaneously taking a stab at Palin's reformist credentials.</p> <p>\"I don't know any mayor in any small town in Kansas who hires a lobbyist and goes after [federal grant money] the way Sarah Palin did,\" she said. \"There's a disconnect between her positioning herself as a typical small town mayor\" and the way she administered the town.</p> <p>Senior Obama strategist Robert Gibbs said Republicans have yet to put a speaker on the dais who will explain how they will improve the lives of hard-up Americans.</p> <p>\"When you go into places like Michigan and talk to auto workers who have had their jobs downsized or shipped overseas\u2026 they want to know what in the world you're going to do to help get them back up on their feet,\" he said. \"We've yet to hear any of that from the Republican convention thus far\".</p>",
  "<p>\"Wake up!\" shouts Aimee Allen. \"Rise and shine! Rise and shine!\"</p> <p>The sun is actually setting outside the 10,000-seat Target Centre in Minneapolis, but the <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/2300-1028_3-6246258-1.html\">crowd is a sea of fist-pumps and cheers</a>. Allen is about to play her selectively-targeted hit song <a href=\"http://www.ronpaularmy.com/2008/02/aimee-allen-ron-paul-revolution-video/\">Revolution</a>, an anthem for Ron Paul's campaign that debuted a bit after the first primaries and has filtered through the speakers at many of the ex-presidential candidate's rallies ever since. Bouncing around the stage in red tights in a goth black skirt, Allen turns Paul's platform into pop-rock couplets. \"We don't want world government,\" she sings, \"or the Bilderberg Group that pays for it.\"</p> <p>Welcome to the parallel universe of Paulistan. All week, diehard supporters of the anti-tax, anti-government, anti-Iraq war, libertarian Texas congressman have <a href=\"http://elections.foxnews.com/2008/09/02/paul-plays-up-role-as-party-outcast-with-gop-counter-convention/\">filtered into the streets of Minneapolis and St Paul</a>, swapping stories from the primaries, showing off homemade or special-designed T-shirts. Hundreds of them are camping an hour away at the Ronstock campground, in a secluded location you need to sign up to learn. Trucks, sedans and motorcycles are covered in bumper stickers: \"Say Yes to Doctor No,\" \"Gold is Money,\" \"Ron Paul Cured My Apathy\" and about a thousand other slogans.</p> <p>It leaves the members of the press in town - all 15,000-odd of them - a little cold. Not many of them are here, despite the lack of news across the river in St Paul. Many of the people in the press section are pro-Paul bloggers or reporters for fringe media. Kevin Barrett, a Wisconsin professor who's running for Congress on the promise to re-investigate the 9/11 attacks, gets a press badge and asks Paul if he supports the cause. \"He says maybe one day we'll find out exactly what happened!\" Barrett exults, grinning ear-to-ear. \"I got my soundbite!\"</p> <p>When Paul's campaign kicked off in early 2007, his role in the wide-open Republican race looked like a simple one. He would talk about small government and the botched Iraq war. He would talk about his record of opposing government surveillance programmes, tax hikes and the department of education. He would lose. </p> <p>That's exactly what happened. But along the way to this convention, the 72-year-old Paul, <a href=\"http://libertarianhistory.blogspot.com/2007/05/ron-paul-campaign-1988.html\">who in 1988 was the Libertarian party's presidential candidate</a>, turned into a surprising cult figure. His diehard supporters - some fraction of the 1.2 million votes he got across the Republican primaries this year - tell people to research his work and ideas as the way to solve America's problems. \"Google Ron Paul,\" reads one T-shirt in the halls. Another T-shirt, a few steps away: \"Have you Googled Ron Paul yet?\"</p> <p>This is ironic. As Paul has become a cult figure, he's exerted less influence on the Republican party he wants to change. The party's platform was written with no virtually input from Paul's energetic activists. Late in the night, a rumour goes through the Target Centre that the GOP will nominate John McCain without Paul's small number of delegates in the building - a signal of how little regard they have for the leadership of Paul's party, and vice-versa.</p> <p>If the GOP isn't worried, it's because Paul has become the latest iconic leader of the political fringe, filling the role played by Ralph Nader in 2004 and 2000, by Ross Perot in the 1990s and by the forgotten John Anderson in 1980. Everybody wants a piece of him, more for his name recognition and fundraising ability than for what he believes. The Independent Greens of Virginia - a key swing state - <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2008/08/17/2008-08-17_mayor_bloomberg_on_virginia_ballot_as_ca.html\">circulated petitions to put Paul on the ballot</a> as the running mate of its presidential candidate, New York mayor Michael Bloomberg. Neither man has accepted or rejected the ballot line, and a Paul spokesman laughed when I asked what his man had in common with the famously nanny-ish mayor.</p> <p>Paul's people are having fun in the Twin Cities, but it's hard to say what they're achieving. Maybe a Sunday afternoon political training session (which sold out quickly) will give them some organisation. Maybe the multiple candidates for Congress who walked the Target Centre, inspired to run by Paul, will hone his message. But <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8063611/\">Tucker Carlson</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=83665295-1de6-4571-af9c-0a90f6d1fde0\">unabashed Paul fan</a> and NBC News commentator who emcees the Rally for the Republic, thinks the idea that Paul's campaign marked a \"libertarian moment\" is bunk.</p> <p>\"Absolutely not,\" says Carlson. \"It's human nature. People want to control what other people are doing.\" </p> <p>Carlson's relatively optimistic about the movement. It's an \"anti-cult of personality\". As fringy as it gets, it contains more sound ideas than, say, a Mitt Romney speech. But Carlson doesn't stay the whole night. He skedaddles after former Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura growls out a speech that calls for, yes, <a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/news/content/news/stories/2008/09/02/ron_paul_convention.html\">a new investigation into 9/11</a>.</p>",

And she is black, one of a tiny number of African Americans at the Republican national convention being held in St Paul this week.</p> <p>A glance around the Republican national convention this week shows a sea of white faces. Only 36 of its delegates are black, less than 2% of the total. At the Democratic convention in Denver last week, 1,087 delegates were black, about a quarter of the total.</p> <p>The Republican party has no African Americans in the US House of Representatives and Senate, while the Democratic party has one African-American US senator -- Barack Obama -- and 42 in the House. The Joint Centre for Political and Economic Studies, a research group that studies African-American politics, has identified seven black Republican nominees for federal office this year -- out of more than 460 races -- and said none are likely to win.</p> <p>While the Democratic party last week made history in nominating the first ever black candidate of a major party for president, the Republican party, which in the 19th century freed the slaves and passed measures aimed at welcoming them into American society, remains bereft.</p> <p>Honeycutt, a physician, is running for congress in an overwhelmingly African American district in Georgia. But in her campaign material she hides her party affiliation.</p> <p>\"I don't want to turn them off by saying I'm a Republican right up front,\" she said in an interview in the convention hall. \"I see blacks voting Democrat because their mother did, their father did, their friend says to vote Democrat. And they're not taking the time to do due diligence and see what does the Democrat party stand for, what does the Republican party stand for.\"</p> <p>Indeed, surveys show African Americans tend to be culturally conservative and churchgoing, favour state aid to parents who send their children to private and parochial schools, and are sceptical of the social security programme, a signature issue of the Democrats.</p> <p>In the face of polls showing African Americans vote, Honey and other black Republicans say that the group is a natural constituency for their party.</p> <p>\"Black folks need to know what the policies are, what the planks in the Republican platform are,\" Honeycutt said. \"They need to see that that is exactly how they live, the conservative lives that they live.\"</p> <p>Black Republicans point to the early history of the party. It was founded on opposition to slavery, and President Abraham Lincoln, who led the north to victory in the civil war that ended slavery, was a Republican. The Republican party also led the fight for a series of constitutional amendments granting citizenship to those slaves, while Democrats in the mid 19th century tended to represent racist Southern interests. Martin Luther King was at one point a Republican, and President George Bush appointed two black secretaries of state.</p> <p>But in the last sixty years, the Democrats largely usurped the Republicans as the party of civil rights. In 1948, Democratic president Harry Truman desegregated the US military, and in the 1960s Democrat Lyndon Johnson shepherded through landmark civil rights legislation even as he acknowledged it would cost him support among southern whites. Arican Americans attracted by Johnson's civil rights record then rose within the party and organised the black community for the Democrats.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Republican presidential candidates, including Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, made appeals to southern whites that were deemed racially tinged. Culturally, the Republican party since the 1960's has seen its base move toward the Southeastern United States, home to the old slave states and to segregation, and the western states where few African Americans live.</p> <p>\"The south becomes Republican, giving blacks all the more reason to become Democrat,\" said Don Rose, a veteran of the civil rights era and press spokesman for Martin Luther King's Chicago campaign.</p> <p>In the 21st century, the lingering Republican deficit among African Americans is clear: In 2004, Bush won 11 percent of the black vote, a figure roughly on par with every election since 1964.</p> <p>John McCain has this year made explicit appeals to black political groups, but his home state of Arizona has a tiny black population.</p> <p>\"In addition, Senator McCain does not comfortably weave expressions of faith and religious beliefs into his campaign's narrative - something that many African Americans can relate to, even if they do not support the candidate,\" writes David Bositis of the Joint Centre for Political and Economic Studies.</p> <p>\"Minorities believe that the GOP is unwelcoming,\" said Larry Sabato, director of the centre for politics at the University of Virginia. \"Blacks see the Republican party as the home of almost all those who today oppose or want to slow civil rights enforcement.\"</p> <p>Black Republicans acknowledge they need to improve their outreach without pandering to blacks or adjusting their policies in a way that would drive away white members of their base.</p> <p>To that end, the National Black Republicans Association has posted billboards across the country reminding Americans that Martin Luther King was a Republican. Richard St Paul, a black Republican city councilman in New Rochelle, New York, said the party should recruit more black candidates.</p> <p>And he is unapologetic about his opposition to Obama, who would be the first black president.</p> <p>\"It's fantastic that Obama has reached that plateau,\" St Paul said. \"Nothing says that I have to support a person just because we're the same colour. Martin Luther King said it's not about the colour of the skin but about the content of the character.\"</p> <p>Rufus Montgomery, an African-American Georgia delegate to the national convention, is sceptical the party should change much at all, noting that Republicans have won the White House in seven out of the last 10 elections without substantial support from blacks.</p> <p>He resorted to a metaphor from American football: \"When you're up 42 to 6 at the half, you don't change your strategy.</p> <p>\"The principles and policies of the Republican party: when that appeals to someone they are welcome to join us.\"</p>",

  "<p>Charles Clarke has reopened the Labour <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/04/labourleadership.labour\">leadership argument</a> (episode 93) this morning. </p> <p>There was much heady talk in early August of the near certainty of a fatal plot. The promise was of a bloody dethroning before the Labour conference. Instead we have a <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2008/09/labour-blair-british-current\">New Statesman commentary</a> and a Today programme interview by the prime minister's longest-standing critic in the parliamentary party. </p> <p>Clarke's intervention was designed to wound, not to kill. He was seeking to put the prime minister on probation for a few months more. His intervention signals that the pre-conference coup is officially off, behind schedule or non-existent. So expect to hear from every commentator that this autumn is Gordon Brown's crucial last chance to mount his fightback. The prime minister may already have been aware of that. </p> <p>Clarke acknowledges that he has long been a Brown sceptic but he ruled out challenging Brown for the leadership later. The rules are too cumbersome, said. There will be circulation of letters from the backbenches: that would be too divisive and damaging. There is also the problem of finding the MPs willing to put their head over the parapet. Clarke remains one of only two or three MPs who have felt it more honest to put doubts on the record rather than brief anonymously.</p> <p>So there is an echo here of the spring of 2007 when Charles Clarke and Alan Milburn could not find the support for a leadership challenge to Gordon Brown, and so held a press conference to launch a now-defunct policy website instead. The political conditions have changed much for the worse. But the majority view on the backbenches is that changing leaders could distract from the challenge of reconstructing Labour's argument and electoral coalition. If nobody else can offer a different Labour argument that would rebuild Labour's electoral coalition, then a leadership change could do little more than bring forward a general election.</p> <p>However, there were two more interesting arguments in Clarke's New Statesman commentary.</p> <p>Firstly, that Blairism is as dead as Monty Python's parrot. There is no restoration project. the ex-premier never wanted or offered to be a king across the water (or, more likely, across the Atlantic in this case).</p> <p>Secondly, Clarke correctly points out that Gordon Brown's biggest error \u2013 over the 10p tax rate \u2013 came from being too Blairite:</p> <blockquote> <p>Economic \"Blairism\" was also defined by opposition to increasing taxes. This reflected the Reagan/Thatcher economic consensus, reinforced by Labour's 1992 shadow budget, that tax-raising political parties lost elections. This belief underpinned the disastrous and unfair basic-rate cut, financed by abolition of the 10p rate, of Gordon Brown's 2007 budget. </p> </blockquote> <p>That was the problem with the leaked \"Blair memo\", regretting that Gordon Brown was not following a \"continuity\" strategy. The irony is that we know that strategy won't work, because Brown has tried rather too much of it. Brown may have run for the prime ministership on \"change\", but the policy has been primarily one of continuity. (Perhaps, in his memoirs, Brown will reveal that this was all simply a cunning ploy to prove just how wrong Alan Milburn was!)</p> <p>New Labour's record is that of the Blair-Brown decade. The Blair-Brown duopoly was itself an amalgamation of centrist politics, liberal economics and quiet social democratic redistribution. Blairite liberal internationalism is in trouble after Iraq. Brownite social democracy must find a way to show that it has not reached the limits of redistribution, by now building wider public support for fairness, the protective role of the state and the cause of ending child poverty in our generation.<br> So the answers of 2008 and 2010 cannot be the same of those of 1995 and 1997. That would be to make Labour a conservative party of the status quo, when it can recover only as a social democratic, centre-left force. And Labour's emerging voices would be mad to want to keep the Blairite and Brownite labels for generations: it is difficult to imagine a more fratricidal feud as we would have to decide which Miliband brother's army to join. On policy substance, Clarke's own views and arguments illustrate this rather well. He is an advocate of (Blairite) co-payments in public services because he does not think the public is willing enough to pay in general taxation for what it demands and expects in services. But he was frustrated by Blair's failure to follow through on his pro-European enthusiasms, and recognises that liberal internationalism and multilateralism have been damaged by the failure of reconstruction in Iraq.</p> <p>But Clarke is considerably more influenced by environmental issues than Blair or Brown. Like Peter Hain, Clarke is among those who believe that Labour has not really begun to work out what an effective \"red and green\" social democracy would look like.</p> <p>Had he been Home Secretary longer, Clarke would have been pushing prisons policy in a more liberal direction, and may well have been more nuanced on civil liberties too \u2013 arguments about which Blair was deeply sceptical, and where Brown has followed a continuity agenda, perhaps more out of agnosticism than conviction.</p> <p>Clarke was a Kinnockite who helped, as chief of staff, drive through many of the reforms to Labour's platform, including the ditching of unilateralism. Yet, in the post-Cold War world, he opposes the renewal of Trident. I agree with him: there is now an <a href=\"http://www.liberalconspiracy.org/2008/07/27/does-obama-want-a-nuclear-free-world/\">astonishingly broad coalition</a> (including McCain and Obama, Henry Kissinger and David Owen) for a renewed push on multilateral disarmament. But this is anathema to many of my Blairite and Brownite friends. On this issue, many may still regard the position Clarke has adopted as what used to be known as \"Trot\".</p> <p>None of us wants to be part of a political party where we agree on everything. That would be a sect, not the type of broad church that can compete for government. </p> <p>Labour should never be frightened of robust discussion of its values, record, ambitions and policy platform. But the truth is also that Labour is less ideologically divided than it has been for generations. We have a collective responsibility for the fate of the party \u2013 and to put the arguments for a fairer Britain which unite us. This autumn is not a test simply of the prime minister but of the rest of his party too.<br> The Blair-Brown generation succeeded in making it possible for Labour to govern again, even if they also remained too much in the shadow of the 1992 defeat. We owe them a debt and stand on their shoulders \u2013 but must think and argue about what they got wrong too. The challenge now is to rethink Labour's public argument for different times.</p>",
  "<p>Sarah Palin has been a gift to political satirists on the web.

  "<p>By common consent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/pakistan\">Pakistan</a> stands at a critical juncture. The Islamist insurgency in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan\">Afghanistan</a> has spread into its western tribal areas, where al-Qaida and Taliban militants are now firmly established. The \"war on terror\" alliance with the US is under severe strain as Washington noisily criticises the army's failure to curb extremism.</p> <p>Meanwhile 71% of Pakistanis, according to a recent poll, believe all counter-terrorism cooperation with the US should be halted.</p> <p>Chronic poverty among an expanding population of about 160 million is being exacerbated by sharply rising food and energy prices that if unchecked, may provoke civil disturbances and further fuel the Islamist fire. According to figures published this week, Pakistan is running a 7.2% budget deficit. Its foreign currency reserves are rapidly depleting. On present trends, the prospect of a default on external payments and an emergency IMF bailout looks very real.</p> <p>On top of this pile of daunting problems has come yet another political crisis following the enforced resignation last month of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/18/pakistan4\">Pervez Musharraf</a>, the country's president and military strongman for most of the past decade. His political enemies, who include the late Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan People's party (PPP) and followers of another former prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, greeted his departure with jubilation.</p> <p>But now the awkward problem of replacing him must be faced. </p> <p>\"Now that Musharraf has gotten the heave-ho, which was fun while it lasted, the squabbling parties face the distressing fact that the public will have no one to blame for the escalating internal mess but them,\" wrote Sayeed Hasan Khan and Kurt Jacobsen in the <a href=\"http://www.dawn.com/2008/09/04/op.htm#2\">Dawn newspaper</a>. \"Musharraf, a useful distraction, soon will be missed even by his very worst enemies.\"</p> <p>There is in truth little doubt who Pakistan's next president will be. Having won the advance support of three out of four provincial assemblies and of a majority in the national parliament, Asif Ali Zardari, Bhutto's widower, is assured of election on Saturday. Sherry Rehman, PPP spokeswoman, says he is the right man for the job. \"Zardari is the consensus candidate ... Only a leadership capable of forging national unity can steer the country out of the crisis brought upon us by a decade of non-democratic rule,\" she said.</p> <p>That is a highly contentious claim. Zardari is notorious in Pakistan for allegedly exploiting his late wife's premiership to fill his own pockets, earning the derisive nickname of \"Mr Ten Percent\". After Bhutto left office, he spent 11 years in prison on corruption and other charges but was never convicted. Now the charges have been quietly dropped while similar allegations against Nawaz, his disputatious former ally, have been resurrected.</p> <p>Zardari has next to no experience of elective office or executive responsibility. According to a poll by ARY, an independent television channel, he registers the lowest voter approval rating among presidential candidates. But in hallowed Pakistani tradition insider political deal-making, including a recent pact with the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islami religious party to halt military operations against militants in Swat, will ensure he gets the job.</p> <p>In short, Zardari does not immediately stand out as the person best equipped to tackle Pakistan's myriad problems. Yet because he is expected to renege on a promise to curb the sweeping authority accumulated by Musharraf, he is set to become the country's most powerful civilian president ever. Some see this as a high price to pay for democracy.</p> <p>\"Some people call Pakistan a rogue state. Now it's going to be a rogue's state,\" said a former senior government official. \"Zardari will have the power to appoint a prime minister, dissolve parliament and appoint the chief of the armed forces. He will be in charge of the nuclear command authority, which oversees Pakistan's nuclear weapons arsenal. His style of leadership combines arrogance with ignorance and cronyism. He has no real party platform. What we are looking at is the rise of a civilian dictator.\"</p> <p>So harsh a verdict, delivered before Zardari takes office, may be a trifle premature. Less impassioned observers say two factors are key to whether he will be an effective leader. One is the attitude of the US. On pragmatic grounds but also because of its ideological commitment to supporting democracy, Washington has taken a back seat so far as the political process unfolds. For his part Zardari pledged this week to maintain the US alliance and help prosecute the \"war on terror\". But his reliability is questioned.</p> <p>The other, crucial factor affecting Zardari's prospects and continued good health is his relationship with the army. If he keeps on the right side of the generals, he may keep his head. But a failed attempt to rein in the Inter-Services Intelligence spy agency has already caused a frisson. And critics suggest his habit of over-reaching is likely, sooner or later, to bring him into conflict with army chiefs.</p> <p>\"Some people compare him to Nawaz Sharif [who was ousted by Musharraf and the army in 1999],\" the former official said. \"But a more accurate comparison may be with Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.\" That is a chilling thought. In one of Pakistan's blackest hours, Benazir's father, a former president and prime minister and founder of the PPP, was deemed by the military to have got above himself. He was executed in 1979.</p>",
  "<p>Her smiling face is a prominent sight at the Republican convention this week, but Cindy McCain has broken with her husband and his running mate Sarah Palin on abortion rights. </p> <p>When asked by CBS news last night whether she wanted to overturn Roe v Wade, the 1973 supreme court ruling that permitted women to seek abortions in America, Cindy McCain responded: \"No, no.\"</p> <p>John McCain vowed last year that he does not support Roe v Wade and would work to overturn it if elected. But during his first presidential run eight years ago, he made comments that were supportive of abortion rights, which appears to have led to some confusion on his wife's part.</p> <p>When the CBS anchor Katie Couric reminded Cindy McCain that \"your husband does\" want to revoke abortion rights, the aspiring first lady responded, \"No, I don't think he does.\"</p> <p>Cindy McCain's comments are the second time in two weeks that a Republican surrogate has muddled the candidate's stance on abortion. The McCain camp released a TV advertisement during the Democratic convention featuring Debra Bartosevich, a self-described Hillary Clinton backer turned McCain fan who was wrongly convinced that the Republican supports abortion rights.</p> <p>\"Going back to 1999, John McCain did an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle saying that overturning Roe v Wade would not make any sense, because then women would have to have illegal abortions,\" Bartosevich told reporters last week.</p> <p>McCain later clarified his 1999 statements to reflect his opposition to abortion rights. Yet a poll conducted this February by Planned Parenthood found continuing confusion, with 46% of female McCain supporters saying they wished to see Roe v Wade upheld.</p> <p>Cindy McCain's remarks may have been aimed at ensuring independent women will continue to sympathise with the Republican ticket. She freely admitted to differing with Palin, the party's vice-presidential nominee, on giving abortion rights to victims of rape and incest.</p> <p>Palin opposes allowing victims of both crimes to have abortions, but Cindy McCain said she was in favour of such exceptions.</p> <p>\"We differ in many issues, we differ across the board with people,\" the Arizona senator's wife said. \"We don't have to agree on every issue.\"</p> <p>Barack Obama's campaign began running a series of radio advertisements in contested states promoting his support for abortion rights and warning women that McCain would \"make abortion illegal\".</p>",

  "<p>Perhaps the adulation of convention delegates in response to Sarah Palin's prime-time address was a given. But the content of her speech was not. Having decided that the best defence is a good offence, John McCain's embattled running-mate took a fighting stance, sarcastically mocking Barack Obama, media elites, and the \"Washington establishment\" as out of touch with the values of smalltown America. </p> <p>\"I've learned quickly, these past few days, that if you're not a member in good standing of the Washington elite, then some in the media consider a candidate unqualified for that reason alone,\" she said, to rapturous applause. \"But here's a little news flash for all those reporters and commentators: I'm not going to Washington to seek their good opinion. I'm going to Washington to serve the people of this country.\" </p> <p>She sought to portray Obama as an effete cosmopolitan, pursuing the presidency as a journey of \"personal discovery\", while McCain, a war hero who made a surprise appearance at the end of the evening, put country first. (A segment on energy policy, meanwhile, drew happy chants of \"Drill! Drill!\" from the crowd.) Much of the US media \u2014 even though it was one of her main targets \u2014 instantly declared her speech a roaring success. </p> <p>The night had been carefully choreographed to present Palin in the best possible light, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/04/uselections2008.sarahpalin1\">Suzanne Goldenberg writes on Guardian.co.uk today</a>. A procession of speakers including Mitt Romney, Mike Huckabee and Rudy Giuliani lashed out at those who had questioned Palin's credentials, deriding \"Hollywood celebrities,\" the \"leftwing media,\" and liberals. As delegates streamed out of the Xcel Centre in St Paul, Minnesota, there was no question: Palin's speech had electrified them. What remained to be seen was how it would play in the country. </p> <p>Last night, it seemed as though the McCain campaign had opted to abandon any attempt to seduce moderate independents, or out-of-pocket voters looking for economic reassurance. Instead, the party chose to energise its conservative base \u2014 the tactic used in 2000 and 2004, and during the Clinton years \u2014 by opening a new front in the long-running American culture wars.</p> <h2>Today at the convention</h2> <p>Palin might be a hard act to follow for McCain, who is due to give his acceptance speech today: such moments are not his forte, and it's possible he could underwhelm. On the other hand, Palin's attacks on Obama, and her focus on McCain's military record, mean he can concentrate on conveying warmth of personality, something he has been sorely lacking so far. Tim Pawlenty, the Minnesota governor who was originally thought to be a leading choice for McCain's vice-presidential pick, is also likely to speak.

  "<p>Since her surprise introduction to the world last Friday, Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin had come under relentless fire for everything from her short tenure as Alaska's governor to her hick roots to her 17-year-old daughter's highly inconvenient <a href=\"http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_stump/archive/2008/09/01/bristol-palin-and-the-jamie-lynn-factor.aspx\">out-of-wedlock pregnancy</a>. Former Bush administration hand <a href=\"http://culture11.com/blogs/kuoandjoe/2008/08/29/palin-on-mtv/\">David Kuo</a> called her \"Dan Quayle with mammaries.\" Washington Post sourpuss <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/01/AR2008090101715.html\">Richard Cohen</a> likened her to Caligula's horse.</p> <p>So when she approached the podium at the Republican National Convention last night and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/04/uselections2008.sarahpalin1\">crowd responded enthusiastically</a>, she let them go on for a while. Palin took a moment to drink it all in, and then did what she came there to do. She introduced herself to a wide audience, lanced Barack Obama, and made the case for why frustrated small town and working class Americans should trust the Republicans with the White House, one more time.</p> <p>So who is Sarah Palin? She called herself \"just one of many moms who'll say an extra prayer each night for our sons and daughters going into harm's way [in Iraq]\" and a \"friend and advocate in the White House\" for other families with \"special needs\" children.</p> <p>Palin labeled herself a \"hockey mom\" and a small town girl who had gone on to great things. She didn't take well to Democratic criticism that her experience as mayor of Wasilla didn't count for much, saying, \"I guess a small-town mayor is sort of like a 'community organiser,' except that you have actual responsibilities.\"</p> <p>It was the first of many, many shots aimed at the Democratic nominee, though she only once called him by name. Palin called the Illinois senator a man \"who can give an entire speech about the wars America is fighting, and never use the word 'victory' except when he's talking about his own campaign.\"</p> <p>She said that the presidency \"is not supposed to be a journey of 'personal discovery'\" and demanded to know, \"When the cloud of rhetoric has passed, when the roar of the crowd fades away, when the stadium lights go out, and those Styrofoam Greek columns are hauled back to some studio lot \u2013 what exactly is our opponent's plan? What does he actually seek to accomplish, after he's done turning back the waters and healing the planet?\"</p> <p>On the economy, she charged that Obama \"supports plans to raise income taxes, raise payroll taxes, raise investment income taxes, raise the death tax, raise business taxes, and increase the tax burden on the American people by hundreds of billions of dollars.\" Palin warned workers and small business owners that this would take a real toll on their jobs and the bottom line.</p> <p>Now, it is customary for the vice-president to attack the other party's presidential nominee with gusto, but there was something more at stake in Palin's speech. It was a proving moment. For all the talk about how \"historic\" it is to have a woman on the Republican ticket, I discovered in writing my book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Warm-Bucket-Brigade-American-Presidency/dp/1595550828\">The Warm Bucket Brigade</a> how common it is for would be VPs to be forced to address serious doubts about their fitness for the nation's second highest office.</p> <p>Richard Nixon faced charges of campaign improprieties in 1952 and dispelled them by giving the famous \"<a href=\"http://www.historyplace.com/speeches/nixon-checkers.htm\">Checkers speech</a>,\" in which he laid it all out there for the American public: all his modest assets, all of his debts, including the interest owed on those debts and the identity of the debt-holders.</p> <p>When George HW Bush announced that he'd picked Dan Quayle, the criticism came fast and fierce and the Bush camp had to constantly dispel rumors that Quayle would be dropped from the ticket. In 1984, Geraldine Ferraro became the first female VP nominee of a major party. Her husband's shaky financial dealings came out and helped undermine confidence in the Democratic ticket.</p> <p>Palin had to dispel the perception that she was a lightweight and deal with those family issues head on. She did the first by delivering a forceful speech with near-perfect timing and some verve. Several cable network commentators simply declared \"a star is born.\"</p> <p>On the subject of her family's controversies, Palin proved utterly defiant. All the Palins who could attend did so. (One memorable clip had daughter Piper licking her hand to slick back baby Trig's hair.) Levi Johnston, future father of Bristol Palin's child, flew in with the family, sat by them at the convention, and even took the stage to wave at the crowd and at the television audience at home.</p> <p>John McCain also put in a surprise appearance. He asked the GOP convention, \"Don't you think we made the right choice for the next vice-president of the United States?\" They answered back a thunderous yes.</p>",
  "<p>A group of prominent Palestinian figures has proposed a radical change in strategy to demand a single, bi-national state if the current round of Middle East peace talks fails.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.palestinestrategygroup.ps/Regaining_the_Initiative_FINAL_17082008_(English).pdf\">Palestinian Strategy Study Group</a>, an EU-funded project written by 27 leading Palestinian figures from across the political spectrum, argued that the current two-state framework for peace talks is failing to bring the promised independent state. Instead, it suggested ending the negotiation process that has gone on now for nearly 20 years, reconstituting the Palestinian Authority into what might become a \"Palestinian Resistance Authority\", and developing a form of \"smart\" resistance. </p> <p>\"The central aim will be to maximise the cost of continuing occupation for Israel, and to make the whole prospect of unilateral separation unworkable,\" it said. The final, and most striking proposal, is to shift to a \"single state outcome\" as the Palestinians' preferred goal. This, it said, would regain the strategic initiative for the Palestinians.</p> <p>\"Although many Palestinians may still prefer a genuine negotiated two-state solution, a failure of the present Annapolis initiative will greatly strengthen those who argue against this,\" the report said. \"Most Palestinians are then likely to be convinced that a negotiated agreement is no longer possible.\"</p> <p>It is not the first time a bi-national state has been proposed as a Palestinian goal, but the new report signals a marked shift in Palestinian thinking at a time when the latest peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians are yet again struggling to make any headway. Questions are now being asked on both sides about the future of the two-state solution that for so long has been the framework of Middle East peacemaking.</p> <p>The greatest disquiet is on the Palestinian side, where even moderates are now beginning to sense the two-state formula is moving out of reach. </p> <p>\"I feel that a two-state solution is losing currency amongst both our peoples and with the world community beyond,\" said Salam Fayyad, the Palestinian prime minister and former World Bank and IMF economist, in a speech he wrote for a meeting of former Israeli diplomats yesterday and which was delivered by Riad Malki, the Palestinian foreign minister. </p> <p>Malki himself admitted that, despite 10 months of talks between Israeli and Palestinian leaders, which began in Annapolis, in the United States, not a single word of agreement had been put on paper. The Annapolis process, the first such peace talks in seven years, were supposed to produce a peace agreement by the end of this year - a goal that has proved wildly unrealistic.</p> <p>Another group, the Israel-Palestine Centre for Research and Information, published a policy document this week with proposals for the Palestinians to change the status quo. Among the options it said were available were dissolving the Palestinian Authority, calling for a one-state solution and making a Kosovo-style unilateral declaration of independence. </p> <p>However, it noted that the chief risk of calling for a single, bi-national state was that nothing would change and the status quo would simply worsen given how deeply unpopular the idea is among Israelis. \"With so little support from the more powerful neighbour, it seems unlikely that the Palestinian call for unity will bring many positive results in the near term,\" it said. Instead, it concluded: \"We feel that a tightly coordinated non-violent campaign toward statehood is the best option.\"</p> <p>One of the key obstacles on the Palestinian side now is the bitter infighting between the two leading factions, Fatah and Hamas. Since last year, Hamas, the Islamist group that won elections in 2006, has been in full control of Gaza and daily seems to be dividing ever further from its rival Fatah, which effectively controls the West Bank. Even if a peace agreement was reached this year, it is hard to see how it might be implemented in Gaza without reconciliation between the rival factions, and for now that seems out of their grasp. </p> <p>Hamas has long argued against negotiations with Israel. \"We don't see any fruits from the political negotiations,\" Ghazi Hamad, a Hamas advisor said in a recent interview in Gaza. \"So we have to make an evaluation for the whole Palestinian national project. Since Madrid in 1991 until now it's been 17 years but we've seen nothing on the ground. How can I convince people that we are going in the right direction?\"</p> <p>On the Israeli side, opinion is more mixed. In general the two-state solution is still broadly regarded as a reasonable goal, although there are many on the rightwing who say Israel should not give up the land it captured in 1967 or who say Israelis have a Biblical right to settle in the West Bank that cannot be negotiated away.</p> <p>Ehud Olmert, the Israeli prime minister who will step down later this month, has pursued negotiations, arguing that a two-state solution is attainable. On Sunday he will discuss with the cabinet a plan to pay compensation to encourage some of the more distant settlers in the West Bank to move either to Israel or to settlements within the West Bank barrier. </p> <p>Tzipi Livni, the foreign minister who is likely to replace him as head of the ruling Kadima party, also argues in favour of negotiations and has been deeply involved in the latest talks, although she has said she would resist pressure to hurry the negotiations. Ehud Barak, the defence minister, suggested yesterday that some of the Palestinian areas of Jerusalem might become the future capital of a Palestinian state, an idea which has not always been palatable to Israelis. </p> <p>Yet there are others beginning to voice different ideas. In a newspaper column in the Yedioth Ahronoth this week, Giora Eiland, a former head of the National Security Council and former national security adviser under Ariel Sharon, said the gap between Israel and the Palestinians was \"enormous\" and growing. </p> <p>\"The maximum that the Israeli government [any government] will be able to offer the Palestinians [and survive politically] falls short of the minimum that the Palestinian government [any government] can agree to accept [and survive politically],\" he wrote. Eiland argued that a final status peace deal \"will not be achievable in the foreseeable future\" and that new ideas should be considered. He suggested returning control of the West Bank to Jordan, who controlled it before the 1967 war.</p>",

  "<p><br> Political cast ... John McCain (second from right) and Sarah Palin (far right) on stage at the Republican national convention. Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</p> <p>This week the blogosphere has been getting partisan. With the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselections2008\">US elections looming</a>, bloggers are taking to their keyboards and tapping away furiously about their preferred candidates. Of course, these are theatre types we are talking about, so we shouldn't be surprised that none of them have much time for the Republicans. </p> <p><a href=\"http://donhall.blogspot.com/2008/09/i-believe.html\">Don Hall</a> is laying into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/04/uselections2008.republicans20081\">Sarah Palin</a>, John McCain's candidate for vice-president, as being \"clueless and devoid of intellectual curiosity\". <a href=\"http://parabasis.typepad.com/blog/2008/09/the-gifts-kookie-pastors.html\">Isaac Butler at Parabasis</a>, who is a member of Obama's arts policy committee, is similarly unimpressed with her. Even the British theatre director Paul Miller is <a href=\"http://paulmillerlondon.wordpress.com/2008/08/08/mccain-dazed-and-confused/\">getting in on the act</a> by posting a video of rather embarrassing clips of McCain gaffes. Scott Walters points out how a McCain presidency could affect theatre-makers in America: \"<a href=\"http://theatreideas.blogspot.com/2008/08/mccain-campaign-member-on-health-care.html\">For artists, particularly, access to health care is probably the most important issue in this election</a>.\" He links to an article showing how <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2008/8/29/14152/9296/806/577869\">woefully inadequate</a> McCain would be in this area.</p> <p>Elsewhere on the blogs, <a href=\"http://www.georgehunka.com/blog/index.cgi/2008/08/28#rogers_080828\">George Hunka draws attention</a> to <a href=\"http://www.offbroadwayonline.com/page.php?key=Keynote2008\">a speech given by the playwright JT Rogers</a>. Speaking of his time researching <a href=\"http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/The%20Overwhelming%2017183.twl\">The Overwhelming</a> in Rwanda, Rogers mentions a conversation he had with one woman he met: \"'I am HIV positive,' she told me. 'I am going to die.' I asked her why she confided this to me. 'Because you are in the theatre,' she told me. 'This is why I am telling you this. The theatre is important for this. To tell this.'\"</p> <p>Hunka finds this statement particularly striking. It shows that when it comes to understanding our human experience, the point is \"not to sermonise or moralise about it (the proper sphere for that is the pulpit), nor to politicise it (the proper sphere for that is the political convention and the political rally), but merely to tell it pure, without the relief that undermines its immediacy, to explore it theatrically.\" He concludes \"This Rwandan genocide survivor seems to have intuited more about the power of theatre, and recognised its potential as a means of communication and compassion (not to mention that she has a greater respect and higher regard for its audiences), than most contemporary US playwrights, directors, dramaturgs and critics.\"</p> <p>In other news, the drought of theatrical coverage on television seems to be bothering writers on both sides of the Atlantic. <a href=\"http://playgoer.blogspot.com/2008/08/plays-on-tv-what-there-was-time.html\">In a guest post on the Playgoer's blog</a>, Abigail Katz laments the fact that plays are no longer filmed for television broadcast as they used to be with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Playhouse\">the American Playhouse series</a>. This leads her to ask, \"Is there any commitment to American theatre on a larger societal and cultural level? Or does it all come from the theatre community itself?\"</p> <p>Michael Billington, in his monthly piece for What's On Stage, points out that there has been <a href=\"http://blogs.whatsonstage.com/2008/08/29/tv-or-not-tv/\">a similar decline in coverage here in the UK</a>. He asks, \"What are we left with today? The opinionated Late Review. The BBC's Culture Show which barely acknowledges theatre's existence. And those endless reality TV casting shows.\" Yet he strikes a note of cautious optimism. Pointing out the enormous publicity garnered by the current RSC production of Hamlet he says \"I hope that the interest in Tennant's Hamlet acts as a wake-up call to the TV panjandrums, and a reminder that theatre is a year-round activity and not an occasional sensation.\"</p> <p>Finally, the passing of Ken Campbell has prompted an <a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/peter_robins/blog/2008/09/02/what_ken_campbell_would_do_for_an_encore\">outpouring of tributes</a> on both the net and in the papers. Perhaps the most fitting of all was actually written before Ken died. Writing, last week, of how he recently bumped into Sylvester McCoy, <a href=\"http://blogs.whatsonstage.com/2008/08/29/brook-the-buzz-and-the-real-mccoy/\">Michael Coveney remembers</a> the work that McCoy and Bob Hoskins used to do with the Ken Campbell Road Show. He concludes: \"I dare say the vaudeville sketches in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/gallery/2008/aug/29/theatre.dance?picture=337044977 \">La Clique, coming to the Hippodrome</a> ... after a sensational success in Edinburgh, are as brilliant and remarkable as some of the stuff Hoskins and McCoy got up to with Ken Campbell; but after catching a brief taster the other night on the deadly Culture Show, I somehow very much doubt it.\" Cheers Ken.</p>",
  "<p>The Politico and <a href=\"http://www.honoluluadvertiser.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080904/NEWS05/809040363/1001/LOCALNEWSFRONT\">the Washington Post</a> are using the word \"ad-lib\" to describe Sarah Palin's joke last night about the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull (answer: lipstick).</p> <p>But if you believe <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ad-lib\">the dictionary definition</a> of the term, Palin's unscripted one-liner was hardly improvised. A McCain aide recalls Palin making <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/weblogs/TWSFP/2008/09/kristol_on_sarah_palin_hockey.asp\">the same joke</a> earlier this week. One pro-Palin blogger <a href=\"http://beldar.blogs.com/beldarblog/2008/09/when-toting-up.html\">remembers her including</a> the joke in a newspaper op-ed column before she ran for governor.</p>",
  "<p>The Republicans are hitting back against not only the Democrats but also against what they see as unfair treatment by the media. The folks at non-partisan FactCheck.org haven't got around to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisking\">Fisking</a> the speech by Rudy Guiliani or vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin, but the Republicans are showing their usual discipline on hammering home talking points. FactCheck has reviewed the speeches of Democrat turned independent Senator Joseph Lieberman and former presidential candidate and Republican Senator Fred Thompson. <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/gop_convention_spin.html\">FactCheck found</a>:</p> <p>\u2022 Lieberman said Obama hadn't \"reached across party lines\" to accomplish \"anything significant,\" though Obama has teamed with GOP Sens. Tom Coburn and Richard Lugar to pass laws enhancing government transparency and curtailing the proliferation of nuclear and conventional weapons. <br>\u2022 Thompson repeated misleading claims about Obama's tax program, saying it would bring \"one of the largest tax increases in American history.\" But as increases go, Obama's package is hardly a history-maker. It would raise taxes for families with incomes above $250,000. Most people would see a cut.<br>\u2022 Lieberman also accused Obama of \"voting to cut off funding for our American troops on the battlefield.\" But Obama's only vote against a war-funding bill came after Bush vetoed a version of the bill Obama had supported - and McCain urged the veto.</p> <p>The Republicans always hammer the Democrats on taxes, even if <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/a_new_stitch_in_a_bad_pattern.html\">many of their attacks run foul of the facts</a>. FactCheck documents their reports with links off to original reporting or source material such as John McCain press releases. They also check the facts on political advertising, and they took the Obama campaign to task for an ad that they are running in Michigan claiming that John McCain does not support <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/hit_the_brakes.html\">loans to help the beleaguered auto industry</a> in the state. It <em>was</em> true, but it isn't now.<br>If you like your fact-checking with graphics, check out <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/\">PolitiFact's Truth-o-meter</a>.

  "<p>Dateline: Dullsville. Day Three of the GOP convention, which feels like it's already lasted half my lifetime. Tonight is <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/politics/state/27810774.html\">Sarah Palin's Big Speech</a>, so it's All Palin All the Time among the talking heads in America's Cable News Land. </p> <p>Scenes from the class struggle in St Paul:</p> <p>\u2022 Chris Matthews on MSNBC is threatening everyone he sees with Lexis-Nexus searches to uncover whether people who are now gushing enthusiastically about Palin ever even mentioned her name before tonight. It's classic Matthews \u2013 bullying, slightly unstable, and repetitive. But, for a change, he's got a pretty good point.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrea Mitchell says the veep speech was written awhile ago for an unnamed running mate, but, when Palin was chosen, it was de-masculinised \u2013 meaning, I suppose, that the reference to \"balls of solid patriotism\" and the stage direction to \"grab crotch\" for emphasis on the line \"I got your hope and change right here\" were removed.</p> <p>\u2022 Tom Brokaw just told me that a waitress in Nebraska working the 4-12 shift at a fast food restaurant \"with a couple of kids to raise and her husband's left her a couple of years ago\" will look at Sarah Palin with a different perspective than he will. Genius. But what about the poor, hard-working waitress/mother whose husband hasn't left her? Don't leave me hangin', Tom! </p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0815/is_1999_March/ai_54753537\">Bob Dole</a> calls Palin a \"mainstream conservative\" (yikes) and says Joe Biden will need to give Palin the respect she's due during the veep debate, \"not because she's a woman, but because of the respect you give people, particularly women.\" It's fun watching the Old Guard GOP try to dress up chivalry and paternalism as feminism. They really should have been paying more attention the last 30 years.</p> <p>Anyhoo\u2026</p> <p>Tonight, there is a lot of chatter about how Palin complements McCain and how she's ready to be \"one heartbeat away\" from the presidency. Keith Olbermann tells us the new talking point on Palin's foreign policy experience (or lack thereof, ahem) is that Alaska's geographical proximity to Russia makes her some kind of expert. Holy Maude, this is getting silly. And of course there's the old \"she's got the good fortune of being on a ticket with John McCain\" canard. I'd really like some enterprising reporter to start asking Republican leaders if, should something require John McCain to abandon the race, they would be comfortable supporting Palin at the top of the ticket. Make them answer yes. I want to hear the absurdity of their saying she's the best person in the nation to represent their party, in McCain's hypothetical absence.</p> <p>There's also lots of chatter about how McCain and Palin are going on the offense against the media. Media elites are big meanies and all that. Yeah, that narrative worked great for Bush in 1992. Run with it, you crazy rebels.</p> <p>Rounding out the trifecta of Things We're Talking About Tonight is the always-fun Vagina Voting. Will Palin appeal to disaffected Hillary Clinton voters? As if on cue, the preposterousness of this possibility is underlined by former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina materializing onstage. She knows John McCain. I know this because she says \"I know John McCain\" about eight thousand times in her boring-ass speech. I'd like to hear less about how she knows John McCain and more about how women are supposed to become CEOs of Fortune 500 corporations if they don't have control over their reproduction.</p> <p>Meanwhile, on the convention floor, the Republicans are dancing to the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Footloose-1984-Film-Various-Artists/dp/B00000D9VZ\">Footloose</a> theme. I was just thinking that what this convention needed was <strong>more Kenny Loggins</strong>!</p> <p>Over on Fox, Bill O'Reilly is wrapping up the trainwreck he calls a show by discussing Michael Phelps. Topical. Now we segue into Hannity &amp; Colmes, where the dipstick duo is chatting with Karl Rove. What in grey-templed hell is Fox doing showing this inane interview when Willard \"Mitt\" Romney is speaking?! I switch back to MSNBC, where Willard is being given the attention he's due as he works himself into a lather pretending, like all those before him at the Xcel Center, that the economy tanked in a void. McCain, it turns out, is running against both the Democrats AND the Republicans.</p> <p>Sayeth Willard: \"People in our party prefer Straight Talk to politically correct talk.\" And not just that. People in his party prefer Straight Talk to honest talk, sensible talk, coherent talk, and interesting talk, too. Beat that, Obama!</p> <p>More dancing on the convention floor now as we wait for Mike Huckabee. There's more energy tonight, but the party scene, such as it is, still has the quality of a camping trip with your parents when you're a teenager. It might be a perfectly swell time until you see a bunch of kids from out of state pull up in a VW Bus, parentless and cool and smelling vaguely of weed \u2013 and suddenly you're consciously trying to have observable fun with your parents, just so the kids don't feel sorry for you. Of course, they're not even paying attention, immersed as they are in their authentic, unselfconscious revelry. (And you're not really succeeding, anyway.) It's this pretense, this desperation, that's making this convention unbearable to watch.</p> <p>Huckabee babbles nonsense about school desks. I think it's a bedtime story, because it's putting me to sleep...</p> <p>When I awaken, Rudy Giuliani is taking the stage, and instantly dashes my hopes for a \"Rudy Giuliani Revue!\" by not wearing his fishnets and failing to enter flanked by two erstwhile Rockettes to be introduced as the \"9/11 Dancers.\" There's no such thing as showmanship anymore. Instead, it's just a bunch of snore-inducing codswallop about lefty media and Hollywood liberals and other Americans who should be sent to Gitmo, followed by a careening stagger from random subject to random subject, eliciting cheers and boos and chants of USA! in the vaguely appropriate spots. Hey, here's a hot bit of news for us, care of Giuly: McCain was a POW. Really? Tell me more. (I know you will!) He is, as always, a brutally bad speaker \u2013 they couldn't have done better finding someone who will inevitably make Palin look good. After this, she could come out and play a funeral dirge on a broken kazoo and look like a dynamo.</p> <p>And she's coming right up! Giuliani spoke so long that he has preempted the video bio package on Palin and she is brought onstage instantly.</p> <p>She gets the biggest cheer I've heard so far as she accepts the nomination for the vice presidency. And then she's off to the races \u2013 McCain is a \"profile in courage.\" She's a mother of one of the troops, one of many moms who will say \"an extra prayer each night.\" She introduces the rest of her kids, talks about how her family's got ups and downs, recounts marrying her high school sweetheart, introduces her parents. She tells us that the difference between a hockey mom and a pitbull is lipstick. And the difference between a mayor and a community organizer is that a mayor's got actual responsibilities. I'm learning a lot tonight.</p> <p>Whatever tonight's theme was officially, unofficially it's \"Issues Schmissues: Barack's a Doodyhead.\"</p> <p>Now Palin tells us she's not a member of the \"Washington elite.\" There's almost no better evidence that someone's a member of the Washington elite than use of the phrase \"Washington elite.\" People who have no interest in Washington don't have cause to use the term Washington elite. You're in it now, sister.</p> <p>She repeats the lie that she didn't support the Bridge to Nowhere. She embarks on a series of petty one-line jabs against the Dems which culminates in a truly childish dig at Obama's staging in Denver, followed by the assertion that Harry Reid saying he can't stand John McCain is perhaps the best evidence they've chosen the right person. If mocking the opinion of a soggy dishrag like Reid is the best they've got, they're really in trouble.</p> <p>And now comes the POW portion of the speech, which has been so voraciously exploited in every speech at this Maudeforsaken convention that it now rings like hold muzak in my ears.</p> <p>When it's over, Palin's family joins her onstage \u2013 and then so does John McCain. Proof of his rebellious maverickosity: Pulling exactly the same \"surprise\" as Obama did last week. If that doesn't perfectly sum up this sorry display, I don't know what would.</p> <p>Overall, it's safe to say that Palin accomplished what she needed to accomplish tonight; she competently delivered a speech on a national stage, looked like she belonged, and claimed her place there. And she laid out a compelling alternative cultural narrative to Barack Obama's story, at least as the Republicans see it. She's a proud, patriotic, traditional, humble, small-town hockey mom who's American through and through \u2013 the kind of person real Americans can vote for, not like some uppity, unpatriotic, worldly, celebrified, latte-drinking, biracial urban sophisticate who's secretly a radical Muslim cokehead abortionist.</p> <p>The choice is clear, Palin seemed to say.</p> <p>But she also said: \"If character is the measure in this election, and hope the theme, and change the goal we share, then I ask you to join our cause.\" Obama's dictating their message \u2013 and I'm not convinced there will be many takers for the pale imitators who mock his rhetoric, even as they steal it for their own.</p>",

  "<p>Well, that felt like a convention. As much as I abhor almost everything these people stand for, I have to say that I found that I was walking out of the Excel Centre in St Paul on Wednesday night with some adrenaline coursing through my body. Tuesday night I felt like I was leaving a funeral home.</p> <p>These were two excellent convention speeches by Rudy Giuliani and Sarah Palin. They were well written and very well delivered. With regard to Giuliani, that was no surprise at all to me. I've seen him give speeches since about 1988. I know what he's capable of. He can parse some of the most credible and authoritative demagoguery of anyone I've ever seen. His mastery of it tonight only left me all the more confused as to why this talent, which has been in his bones seemingly from birth, appeared to elude him during the very months he was seeking the presidency. </p> <p>It was fine stage management, too, to flow straight from Giuliani to Palin, without a pause for the talking heads to get in there and fart over the proceedings for three minutes. The design was surely to make Palin feel at ease as she took the stage before an already adoring crowd.</p> <p>Palin started out visibly nervous, but it didn't take her long to warm up at all. She gave the crowd absolutely everything it wanted, and her speech was peppered with effective zingers. Her lines of praise for McCain were just right. Her testimonials about her family were tonally on. Her criticisms of Obama and Biden were tremendous crowd pleasers. Her digs at Obama's career as a community organizer were probably the most effective: \"A small town mayor is sort of like a community organizer, except that you have actual responsibilities.\" Even I can't say that wasn't a good one.</p> <p>In the short term, Palin certainly saved her candidacy. On Wednesday afternoon, news broke of the off-camera discussion between Peggy Noonan and Mike Murphy, two famed GOP advisers and media savants, who were caught saying that they thought Palin was a disaster and the race was, as Noonan put it, \"over.\" This Irish grave dance was huge news. No Republican had really gone after Palin on the record before, and the exposure of this conversation threatened to open the floodgates. But Palin's performance was good enough to prevent that, and to allow Murphy and Noonan to pull a <em>volte face</em> and get back on the team. </p> <p>Palin also, in the short term, got the delegates firmly and implacably on her side. Her line about the media was, again, more deft than one had reason to expect and cleverly delivered: \"I'm not going to Washington to seek their good opinion. I'm going to Washington to serve the people of this great country.\" She will pay for that line, but it did her good tonight.</p> <p>But here's the thing she did not accomplish, I don't think, in the long term. This was billed in advance as a \"policy\" speech, and it was decidedly not that. Of the speech's 38 minutes, she spent about nine or 10 minutes talking about energy policy, and even then in only the most platitudinous tropes. In policy terms, that was it. A few shots at the Democrats for the old \"they'll raise your taxes\" bugaboo, but not one word on what she and McCain would really do to improve the economy.</p> <p>I size it up like this. Let's say I were a laid-off, $45,000-a-year worker in Ohio. If I were sitting on an olio of right-wing resentments, about elitist liberals and the media and this and that kind of thing, I may have fallen in love with her. She was that compelling as a human being.</p> <p>But if I weren't sitting on those resentments, I'd have been asking myself, \"Uh, what exactly did she say to me, to address my concerns?\" Barack Obama was hammered a million and one times for allegedly failing to do exactly this. But compared to Palin on this score he has been FDR a thousand times over. Palin's argument tonight wasn't an argument, it was an arrow aimed at the viscera: If you relate to what I'm telling you about the media and these liberals, join the team. If you don't, then \u2026 well, it seems that neither she nor the person who wrote the speech had the imagination to envision those people.</p> <p>One last cautionary note to conservative serum-drinkers, or to liberals terrified now that she's impossibly formidable. Remember how things change in 24 or 48 hours. We're still sitting on a powder keg of Palin administration and family potential scandals. One could break Friday, and suddenly, the speech would be forgotten instantly. Or one might not. But whatever the case, the speech will fade. She will also soon face the reality that she will have to endure a tough interview or two, without a teleprompter and without an adoring crowd. And, since she opened up a can of whup-ass on the Democrats, it entitles them to open up a can on her. One can be sure they will.<br></p>",
  "<p>The instant you walked into the Mug-Shot Saloon, a hard-drinking straight-talking bar on the outskirts of town, there were a couple of clues as to the loyalties of its clientele. The first was a big sign up advertising the \"Palin special\" \u2013 an eight-inch sausage pizza doing a brisk trade at only $6.</p> <p>The second clue was the fact that the packed crowd of more than 100 locals - a lavish turn out for a week night - was cheering the wooden roof off whenever the woman speaking on the enlarged flat-screen television made a point. It began the moment she said that she accepted the nomination as Republican vice-presidential candidate, which prompted hoots and cat whistles all around the bar.</p> <p>It continued when Sarah Palin said that her nomination showed that every woman can walk through every door of opportunity, which had all of the many women in the saloon applauding. And it reached a peak when she cracked just about the only joke of her speech: what's the difference between a hockey mom and a pitbull? Lipstick.</p> <p>A saloon bar crowd on the edge of Wasilla - the town where Palin grew up and where she was mayor in the late 1990s before going on to become Alaska's first female governor - is hardly representative of the American electorate. Everyone seemed to know her or at least to have met her.</p> <p>But if the frequent shouts of \"Go girl!\" and \"Yeah baby!\" tell us anything, it is that Palin's direct and earthy delivery last night will speak volumes to the conservative heartland that until now has remained so uncertain about the candidacy of John McCain. As Leone Harris put it: \"It's about time the vice-president had balls. And Sarah Palin has balls.\"</p> <p>Leah Bragg said Palin had talked \"straight to America's heart - she told it like it is.\" Her mother had received political support from Palin when she waged a battle in Alaska to lower taxes on cigarettes (you can smoke freely in a libertarian state like Alaska and the bar was full of smoke). </p> <p>Vickie Dyas responded warmly when Palin told the convention that her son Track was about to go to Iraq. \"My daughter's already there. Been there since March. So I know how she's feeling as a mom.\"</p> <p>Larry Evanson gave the most expansive praise. He said the speech showed America the potential of a woman who could one day be president herself. \"I think Sarah just won this election, not McCain. She's one hell of a woman. I know that - I live here.\"</p>",

They lauded what they described as her toughness, wit and command of her personal narrative in her first major address to the party.</p> <p>Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, former leader of Senate Republicans, said she gave an effective paean to nominee John McCain.</p> <p>\"She talked about John McCain's character, his experience, she talked about the life he's lived, she talked about the career he's had,\" Lott said. \"She talked about her own courage, and character and leadership and support of reform, and getting corruption under control\".</p> <p>Don Metzger of the North Carolina delegation said she adequately addressed Democratic broadsides about the depth of her experience.</p> <p>\"She made some great points when it came to demonstrating her executive decision capabilities,\" he said. \"As a mayor and a governor, she's had to actually deal with real decisions.\"</p> <p>Metzger said he wished she had confronted Obama's support for abortion rights, referring to a statement the Illinois senator made at a recent forum at an evangelical church when asked at what point foetuses \"get human rights\".</p> <p>\"I was disappointed they didn't make the point that when you're in the White House and it comes time to make a decision, you can't say, 'That's above my pay grade.'\"</p> <p>Hanna Malaihollo, an 18-year-old alternate delegate from California, said: \"It was awesome. She just put it out there that she does have experience, and she was funny at the same time.\"</p> <p>Dan Ramirez of North Carolina said she showed she could go head-to-head with Democratic vice-presidential nominee Joe Biden, a foreign policy expert and skilled debater.</p> <p>\"She's not going to be a pushover when it comes to debates, when it comes to the actual campaign,\" he said.</p> <p>Mike Glavin, a North Carolina political worker for a trade association, said Palin's speech was politically effective in that it riled up the \"worker bees\" of the party on the convention floor.</p> <p>\"These are the folks that make the phone calls and knock on doors, and to see their level of excitement, it heartens me for the future of the campaign,\" he said. \"A lot of work still needs to be done on the ground, in phone banks and on the streets and neighbourhoods. I don't think we had that much enthusiasm, say a month ago, as we do now.\"</p> <p>The delegates welcomed her comments on the news media, which came at the end of a day of coordinated attacks on news outlets by Republican campaign strategists and spokespeople.</p> <p>\"The news media has tried to steer a lot of this election, and has not reported both sides of what's going on,\" said Glennda Cook of Texas. \"It's been very slanted\".</p> <p>Metzger of North Carolina said, \"It is time that we in this country live our lives and govern ourselves irrespective of what the media says. </p> <p>\"The news media do not control this country, should not control this country, and if we ever allow that to happen we're doomed.\"</p> <p>Palin's speech contained few details on Republican economic proposals, but Michael Steele, former lieutenant governor of Maryland, said that was appropriate for an acceptance speech by a vice-presidential nominee.</p> <p>\"She's running for vice-president, not president,\" said Steele. \"John McCain sets the bar, sets the stage, sets the pace of this race. Her job is to make sure that's executed and implemented the way the ticket decides it's going to be. I thought she did very well, laying out what that vision is that Senator McCain has for this country, talking about energy, talking about the things that are important to families. And I think that's all you can ask\".</p>",
  "<p>Well, this election's going to be one hell of a fight. After listening to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/04/uselections2008.sarahpalin1\">Sarah Palin's speech in St Paul last night</a>, it's clear the Republicans have assembled a formidable team aimed at winning the election \u2013 the election of 2000. How successful this will be for winning the election of 2008 is an open question.</p> <p>Palin's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/04/uselections2008.sarahpalin\">speech</a> last night was note-perfect. Whoever wrote it deserves credit for producing something perfectly pitched to the occasion \u2013 but Palin deserves even more for her delivery. Once she got into her stride, she showed why it would be dangerous to underestimate her on the basis of her thin resume and limited national experience.</p> <p>It wasn't so much what she said \u2013 she didn't say much, certainly little in positive detail outside the need to drill for oil anywhere and everywhere \u2013 it was the way she said it. For those who were half-expecting some Alaskan redneck to come on stage and wrestle a polar bear while riding a snowmobile, the speech will perhaps have come as a shock. But as a former TV newsreader, an autocue holds no fears for Palin.</p> <p>The first half of the speech was anodyne, as these things usually are: the recitation of the members of her family and their sterling qualities. Joe Biden did much the same in Denver last week \u2013 the Republicans certainly have no monopoly on the Oprahfication of American politics. But Palin touched the nadir to date, when a candidate for the vice-presidency of the United States described her husband Todd: \"We met in high school, and two decades and five children later he's still my guy \u2026 Throw in his Yup'ik Eskimo ancestry, and it all makes for quite a package.\"</p> <p>Fortunately, the talk about Todd's package didn't last. There was at least one off-the-cuff joke \u2013 \"What's the difference between a hockey mom and a pitbull? Lipstick.\" \u2013 and one duff line, a reprise of her claim: \"I told the Congress 'thanks, but no thanks,' for that Bridge to Nowhere.\" Except that's not true \u2013 or at least not as true as it sounds, since Palin <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/vcCandidateFeed7/idUSN3125537020080901\">supported the infamous bridge of pork</a> before she was against it.</p> <p>But the general effect was electrifying. A committed Democratic supporter would have hated it \u2013 and that was the idea. Palin was speaking directly to those people who voted for the Republicans and George Bush in 2000, and hence her speech was a reprise of the sort of speeches that Bush himself used to give back in 2000 \u2013 although her delivery and fluency are far superior. The question is: are enough of those same voters still listening? In anything other than out of curiosity, that is.</p> <p>If they were, they would have heard Palin deliver some sharp lines aimed at Barack Obama and his record. But the bulk of the speech was a ringing endorsement of John McCain. And that is the main role of a vice-presidential candidate: to boost and support the top of the ticket. Palin last night demonstrated that she outshines McCain as a speaker \u2013 and her youth makes McCain look even older in contrast. Could it be that McCain has made a mistake by choosing a VP candidate who too obviously underlines his shortcomings? The mood in the conference hall was such that had a cry gone up to nominate Sarah rather than John, who knows what would have happened?</p> <p>There is a long way to go yet, and Palin has big hurdles to cross between now and November 4. She has yet to hold a full press conference, and then of course there is the VP debate with Joe Biden. But the evidence of last night is that Palin will deal with those obstacles competently at least \u2013 and possibly better than that. So far Palin perfectly complements the McCain campaign tactics of attacking the Democrats and offering little other than biography (five years in the Hanoi Hilton! five children!) in return. And if 2008 does turn out to be a sequel to 2000, then McCain and Palin will win.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337286269\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>Sarah Palin lived up to her teenage moniker of \"Sarah Barracuda\" last night in a formidable prime-time national television debut that energised the Republican convention and set up the cultural fault lines for the coming election.</p> <p>It was by far the largest audience Palin had ever encountered - and her appearance followed days of intense scrutiny of her credentials to be vice-president and her family life, including her teenage pregnant daughter.</p> <p>Her voice quavered at first, and she seemed rattled at times by the huge enthusiasm and cheers from the crowd. She spoke over the applause, and shuffled papers. </p> <p>But as the speech went on Palin seemed much more sure of herself. The woman who was called a barracuda as a teenager for her extreme competitiveness on the basketball court showed she was supremely comfortable in her role as the primary line of attack for the Republican candidate, John McCain.</p> <p>She also showed a gift for off-the-cuff sarcastic one-liners that could well give Democratic strategists reason for worry in the days ahead - as well as the verbose vice-presidential candidate, Joe Biden, whom Palin will meet in a televised debate.</p> <p>The rapturous response from the crowd also made it clear that having her on the ticket had fired up a Republican base that had earlier shown only tepid support for McCain.</p> <p>Palin, while beginning with a soft-focus potted bio of her life as a mother of five in small town Alaska, soon shifted from folksiness into full frontal attack. She framed the argument against the Democrat, Barack Obama, along a cultural divide between left and right, urban and rural, secular and religious, that was readily recognisable to the crowd.</p> <p>\"I am not a member of the permanent Washington establishment. And I've learned quickly, these past few days, that if you're not a member in good standing of the Washington elite, then some in the media consider a candidate unqualified for that reason alone,\" said to sustained applause and scattered boos for the references to media.</p> <p>\"But here's a little news flash for all those reporters and commentators: I'm not going to Washington to seek their good opinion. I'm going to Washington to serve the people of this country. Americans expect us to go to Washington for the right reasons, and not just to mingle with the right people.\"</p> <p>Within just a few minutes, Palin felt confident enough to deviate from a speech that campaign aides admitted had been partially drafted even before McCain chose her as his running mate. </p> <p>\"I love those hockey moms,\" Palin said in acknowledgement of the crowd. \"You know what they say is the difference between hockey moms and a pit bull? Lipstick.\"</p> <p>Palin demonstrated that toughness, painting Obama as a vainglorious, tax-and-spend liberal, who does not have the stomach to win the war in Iraq. </p> <p>\"When the cloud of rhetoric has passed ... when the roar of the crowd fades away ... when the stadium lights go out, and those Styrofoam Greek columns are hauled back to some studio lot - what exactly is our opponent's plan? What does he actually seek to accomplish, after he's done turning back the waters and healing the planet?\" Palin sneered.</p> <p>It was the start of a steady demolition of Obama's claims to be a change candidate that frequently brought the crowd to its feet.<br>\"In politics, there are some candidates who use change to promote their careers,\" she said. \"And then there are those, like John McCain, who use their careers to promote change.\"</p> <p>While her attacks on Obama occupied a significant portion of her speech, Palin also shored up her own reputation as a maverick in Alaska and as an opponent of environmental controls on oil exploration in the Arctic wilderness. As she spoke about energy, a number of people in the hall chanted: \"drill, drill.\"</p> <p>However, Palin was far less persuasive when she came to the emotional passages of her speech, especially those talking about McCain's years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam.</p> <p>Instead, her forte is the sardonic one-liner - as she demonstrated in her delivery of the lines depicting Obama as an egghead intellectual, or a new-age flake who sees the White House as a place for on the job training. \"My fellow citizens, the American presidency is not supposed to be a journey of \"personal discovery.\" </p> <p>She ended to a rapturous ovation and an appearance by John McCain. He showed his gratitude, going on stage at the end of the speech to stand by Palin and her family, including her pregnant daughter, Bristol, 17, and Bristol's boyfriend. \"Don't you think we have made the right choice as the next vice-president of the United States,\" McCain said. \"What a beautiful family.\"</p> <p>Although Palin delivered a supremely assured performance for a woman who was a virtual political unknown less than a week ago, the night was carefully engineered to put her in the best possible light, and to unite the party around her. </p> <p>In the run-up to her speech, the giant screen behind the stage alternately showed a backdrop of the frozen north and the Stars and Stripes fluttering in the breeze.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a procession of speakers lashed out at those who had questioned Palin's credentials as \"Hollywood celebrities,\" \"leftwing media,\" and liberals - producing mass chants of \"Sarah, Sarah\".</p> <p>By the time Palin at last appeared, the crowd was entirely hers. As she walked onto the stage, the hall jumped to its feet offering her several minutes of sustained applause and cheering. Several people in the crowd had homemade signs reading: \"Palin power\".</p>",
  "<p>The Republican convention, subdued during its first two days, caught fire last night when Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, produced a barnstorming speech that subjected Barack Obama to a sustained battering at the party convention in St Paul.</p> <p>Giuliani and two other prominent Republicans defeated by John McCain in the battle for the presidential nomination - Mike Huckabee and Mitt Romney - brought the convention to life as they praised their former opponent and heaped derision on Obama.</p> <p>Giuliani received the loudest applause of the convention so far - at least until Sarah Palin appeared later - and won ovation after ovation for his jibes at Obama. </p> <p>His popularity at the convention and his easy, sarcastic delivery raised the question of how he had failed to secure the Republican presidential nomination.</p> <p>As he last night ridiculed what he portrayed as Obama's limited career of service, he frequently had to stop because of cheers and jeers from the 20,000 delegates. Giuliani mentioned with scorn that Obama had only been a \"community organiser\" in Chicago. The former mayor had to take a lengthy pause to allow the jeers to die away, and then again when he ran through Obama's short Senate career.</p> <p>Giuliani said: \"He's never run a city, never run a state, never run a business. He's never had to lead people in crisis. This is not a personal attack ... it's a statement of fact - Barack Obama has never led anything. Nothing. Nada.\"</p> <p>He noted that McCain had produced a strong, well thought-out response when Russia rolled over Georgia, whereas Obama had suggested that the UN security council - which brought boos from the delegates - could find a solution, seemingly unaware that Russia had a veto on the council.</p> <p>\"Here's some free advice Senator Obama, next time just call John McCain,\" Giuliani said. </p> <p>Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor who was a surprise dark horse who stayed in the race with McCain to the end, also won repeated rounds of applause.</p> <p>Huckabee paid tribute to Obama's achievement in becoming the first African American to win the Democratic presidential nomination, but that did not mean he was fit to become commander in chief. </p> <p>\"Maybe the most dangerous threat of an Obama presidency is that he would continue to give madmen the benefit of the doubt. If he's wrong just once, we will pay a heavy price,\" Huckabee said.</p> <p>As part of the hardening of support behind Palin, Huckabee inserted a late change to his speech saying that the media elite had united the party and country behind the vice-presidential candidate with reports that were \"tackier than costume changes at a Madonna concert\".</p> <p>Romney, the multi-millionaire businessman who tried to spend his way to the nomination, called on voters to support McCain but also kept open the option of another run in 2012 with a populist speech positioning himself well to the right and repeatedly denouncing liberals.</p> <p>In spite of loud applause when he began, the enthusiasm for him was less than that for either Huckabee or Giuliani.</p> <p>But Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts and a Mormon, won cheers when he suggested Obama was too weak to stand up to what McCain had described as the evil of radical, violent Islam. McCain, he said, would defeat it. </p> <p>\"We will never allow America to retreat in the face of evil extremism,\" he said, implying that Obama would. </p> <p>In keeping with this theme, he cast doubt on the patriotism of Obama's wife, Michelle, over a remark in January in which she said she had been proud of America for the first time when Iowa voted for him for the Democratic nomination. \"Just like you, there has never been a day when I was not proud to be an American,\" Romney said.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337286269\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>Mr Chairman, delegates and fellow citizens: I am honoured to be considered for the nomination for vice-president of the United States ...</p> <p>I accept the call to help our nominee for president to serve and defend America. </p> <p>I accept the challenge of a tough fight in this election ... against confident opponents ... at a crucial hour for our country. </p> <p>And I accept the privilege of serving with a man who has come through much harder missions ... and met far graver challenges ... and knows how tough fights are won - the next president of the United States, John S McCain. </p> <p>It was just a year ago when all the experts in Washington counted out our nominee because he refused to hedge his commitment to the security of the country he loves.</p> <p>With their usual certitude, they told us that all was lost - there was no hope for this candidate who said that he would rather lose an election than see his country lose a war. </p> <p>But the pollsters and pundits overlooked just one thing when they wrote him off.</p> <p>They overlooked the caliber of the man himself - the determination, resolve and sheer guts of Senator John McCain. The voters knew better. </p> <p>And maybe that's because they realise there is a time for politics and a time for leadership ... a time to campaign and a time to put our country first. </p> <p>Our nominee for president is a true profile in courage, and people like that are hard to come by.</p> <p>He's a man who wore the uniform of this country for 22 years, and refused to break faith with those troops in Iraq who have now brought victory within sight. </p> <p>And as the mother of one of those troops, that is exactly the kind of man I want as commander in chief. I'm just one of many moms who'll say an extra prayer each night for our sons and daughters going into harm's way. </p> <p>Our son Track is 19. </p> <p>And one week from tomorrow - September 11th - he'll deploy to Iraq with the Army infantry in the service of his country. </p> <p>My nephew Kasey also enlisted, and serves on a carrier in the Persian Gulf.</p> <p>My family is proud of both of them and of all the fine men and women serving the country in uniform. Track is the eldest of our five children. </p> <p>In our family, it's two boys and three girls in between - my strong and kind-hearted daughters Bristol, Willow and Piper. </p> <p>And in April, my husband Todd and I welcomed our littlest one into the world, a perfectly beautiful baby boy named Trig. From the inside, no family ever seems typical.</p> <p>That's how it is with us. </p> <p>Our family has the same ups and downs as any other ... the same challenges and the same joys. </p> <p>Sometimes even the greatest joys bring challenge.</p> <p>And children with special needs inspire a special love. </p> <p>To the families of special-needs children all across this country, I have a message: For years, you sought to make America a more welcoming place for your sons and daughters.</p> <p>I pledge to you that if we are elected, you will have a friend and advocate in the White House. Todd is a story all by himself. </p> <p>He's a lifelong commercial fisherman ... a production operator in the oil fields of Alaska's north slope ... a proud member of the United Steel Workers' Union ... and world champion snow machine racer. </p> <p>Throw in his Yup'ik Eskimo ancestry, and it all makes for quite a package. </p> <p>We met in high school, and two decades and five children later he's still my guy. My mom and dad both worked at the elementary school in our small town. </p> <p>And among the many things I owe them is one simple lesson: that this is America, and every woman can walk through every door of opportunity. </p> <p>My parents are here tonight, and I am so proud to be the daughter of Chuck and Sally Heath. Long ago, a young farmer and haberdasher from Missouri followed an unlikely path to the vice-presidency. </p> <p>A writer observed: \"We grow good people in our small towns, with honesty, sincerity and dignity.\" I know just the kind of people that writer had in mind when he praised Harry Truman.</p> <p>I grew up with those people. </p> <p>They are the ones who do some of the hardest work in America ... who grow our food, run our factories and fight our wars.</p> <p>They love their country, in good times and bad, and they're always proud of America. I had the privilege of living most of my life in a small town. </p> <p>I was just your average hockey mom, and signed up for the PTA because I wanted to make my kids' public education better. </p> <p>When I ran for city council, I didn't need focus groups and voter profiles because I knew those voters, and knew their families, too.</p> <p>Before I became governor of the great state of Alaska, I was mayor of my hometown.</p> <p>And since our opponents in this presidential election seem to look down on that experience, let me explain to them what the job involves. </p> <p>I guess a small-town mayor is sort of like a \"community organizer,\" except that you have actual responsibilities. I might add that in small towns, we don't quite know what to make of a candidate who lavishes praise on working people when they are listening, and then talks about how bitterly they cling to their religion and guns when those people aren't listening.</p> <p>We tend to prefer candidates who don't talk about us one way in Scranton and another way in San Francisco. </p> <p>As for my running mate, you can be certain that wherever he goes, and whoever is listening, John McCain is the same man. I'm not a member of the permanent political establishment.</p> <p>And I've learned quickly, these past few days, that if you're not a member in good standing of the Washington elite, then some in the media consider a candidate unqualified for that reason alone. </p> <p>But here's a little news flash for all those reporters and commentators: I'm not going to Washington to seek their good opinion - I'm going to Washington to serve the people of this country. Americans expect us to go to Washington for the right reasons, and not just to mingle with the right people.</p> <p>Politics isn't just a game of clashing parties and competing interests. </p> <p>The right reason is to challenge the status quo, to serve the common good, and to leave this nation better than we found it.</p> <p>No one expects us to agree on everything.</p> <p>But we are expected to govern with integrity, good will, clear convictions and ... a servant's heart. </p> <p>I pledge to all Americans that I will carry myself in this spirit as vice president of the United States. This was the spirit that brought me to the governor's office, when I took on the old politics as usual in Juneau ... when I stood up to the special interests, the lobbyists, big oil companies, and the good-ol' boys network.</p> <p>Sudden and relentless reform never sits well with entrenched interests and power brokers. That's why true reform is so hard to achieve. </p> <p>But with the support of the citizens of Alaska, we shook things up.</p> <p>And in short order we put the government of our state back on the side of the people.</p> <p>I came to office promising major ethics reform, to end the culture of self-dealing. And today, that ethics reform is the law. </p> <p>While I was at it, I got rid of a few things in the governor's office that I didn't believe our citizens should have to pay for.</p> <p>That luxury jet was over the top. I put it on eBay. </p> <p>I also drive myself to work.</p> <p>And I thought we could muddle through without the governor's personal chef - although I've got to admit that sometimes my kids sure miss her. I came to office promising to control spending - by request if possible and by veto if necessary. </p> <p>Senator McCain also promises to use the power of veto in defense of the public interest - and as a chief executive, I can assure you it works.</p> <p>Our state budget is under control.</p> <p>We have a surplus.</p> <p>And I have protected the taxpayers by vetoing wasteful spending: nearly half a billion dollars in vetoes. </p> <p>I suspended the state fuel tax, and championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending by Congress.</p> <p>I told the Congress \"thanks, but no thanks,\" for that bridge to nowhere.</p> <p>If our state wanted a bridge, we'd build it ourselves. When oil and gas prices went up dramatically, and filled up the state treasury, I sent a large share of that revenue back where it belonged - directly to the people of Alaska. </p> <p>And despite fierce opposition from oil company lobbyists, who kind of liked things the way they were, we broke their monopoly on power and resources.</p> <p>As governor, I insisted on competition and basic fairness to end their control of our state and return it to the people.</p> <p>I fought to bring about the largest private-sector infrastructure project in North American history. </p> <p>And when that deal was struck, we began a nearly $40bn natural gas pipeline to help lead America to energy independence.</p> <p>That pipeline, when the last section is laid and its valves are opened, will lead America one step farther away from dependence on dangerous foreign powers that do not have our interests at heart. </p> <p>The stakes for our nation could not be higher.</p> <p>When a hurricane strikes in the Gulf of Mexico, this country should not be so dependent on imported oil that we are forced to draw from our strategic petroleum reserve.</p> <p>And families cannot throw away more and more of their paychecks on gas and heating oil. </p> <p>With Russia wanting to control a vital pipeline in the Caucasus, and to divide and intimidate our European allies by using energy as a weapon, we cannot leave ourselves at the mercy of foreign suppliers.</p> <p>To confront the threat that Iran might seek to cut off nearly a fifth of world energy supplies ... or that terrorists might strike again at the Abqaiq facility in Saudi Arabia ... or that Venezuela might shut off its oil deliveries ... we Americans need to produce more of our own oil and gas. </p> <p>And take it from a gal who knows the north slope of Alaska: we've got lots of both.</p> <p>Our opponents say, again and again, that drilling will not solve all of America's energy problems - as if we all didn't know that already.</p> <p>But the fact that drilling won't solve every problem is no excuse to do nothing at all. </p> <p>Starting in January, in a McCain-Palin administration, we're going to lay more pipelines build more nuclear plants create jobs with clean coal ... and move forward on solar, wind, geothermal and other alternative sources.</p> <p>We need American energy resources, brought to you by American ingenuity and produced by American workers. I've noticed a pattern with our opponent.</p> <p>Maybe you have, too.</p> <p>We've all heard his dramatic speeches before devoted followers. </p> <p>And there is much to like and admire about our opponent.</p> <p>But listening to him speak, it's easy to forget that this is a man who has authored two memoirs but not a single major law or reform - not even in the state senate. </p> <p>This is a man who can give an entire speech about the wars America is fighting, and never use the word \"victory\" except when he's talking about his own campaign. But when the cloud of rhetoric has passed ... when the roar of the crowd fades away ... when the stadium lights go out, and those Styrofoam Greek columns are hauled back to some studio lot - what exactly is our opponent's plan? What does he actually seek to accomplish, after he's done turning back the waters and healing the planet? The answer is to make government bigger ... take more of your money ... give you more orders from Washington ... and to reduce the strength of America in a dangerous world. America needs more energy ... our opponent is against producing it. </p> <p>Victory in Iraq is finally in sight ... he wants to forfeit.</p> <p>Terrorist states are seeking nuclear weapons without delay ... he wants to meet them without preconditions.</p> <p>Al Qaeda terrorists still plot to inflict catastrophic harm on America ... he's worried that someone won't read them their rights? Government is too big ... he wants to grow it.</p> <p>Congress spends too much ... he promises more. </p> <p>Taxes are too high ... he wants to raise them. His tax increases are the fine print in his economic plan, and let me be specific.</p> <p>The Democratic nominee for president supports plans to raise income taxes ... raise payroll taxes ... raise investment income taxes ... raise the death tax ... raise business taxes ... and increase the tax burden on the American people by hundreds of billions of dollars. My sister Heather and her husband have just built a service station that's now opened for business - like millions of others who run small businesses. </p> <p>How are they going to be any better off if taxes go up? Or maybe you're trying to keep your job at a plant in Michigan or Ohio ... or create jobs with clean coal from Pennsylvania or West Virginia ... or keep a small farm in the family right here in Minnesota.</p> <p>How are you going to be better off if our opponent adds a massive tax burden to the American economy? Here's how I look at the choice Americans face in this election.</p> <p>In politics, there are some candidates who use change to promote their careers. </p> <p>And then there are those, like John McCain, who use their careers to promote change.</p> <p>They're the ones whose names appear on laws and landmark reforms, not just on buttons and banners, or on self-designed presidential seals. </p> <p>Among politicians, there is the idealism of high-flown speechmaking, in which crowds are stirringly summoned to support great things. </p> <p>And then there is the idealism of those leaders, like John McCain, who actually do great things. They're the ones who are good for more than talk ... the ones we have always been able to count on to serve and defend America. Senator McCain's record of actual achievement and reform helps explain why so many special interests, lobbyists and comfortable committee chairmen in Congress have fought the prospect of a McCain presidency - from the primary election of 2000 to this very day. </p> <p>Our nominee doesn't run with the Washington herd.</p> <p>He's a man who's there to serve his country, and not just his party. </p> <p>A leader who's not looking for a fight, but is not afraid of one either. Harry Reid, the majority leader of the current do-nothing Senate, not long ago summed up his feelings about our nominee. </p> <p>He said, quote, \"I can't stand John McCain\". Ladies and gentlemen, perhaps no accolade we hear this week is better proof that we've chosen the right man. Clearly what the majority leader was driving at is that he can't stand up to John McCain. That is only one more reason to take the maverick of the Senate and put him in the White House. My fellow citizens, the American presidency is not supposed to be a journey of \"personal discovery.\" This world of threats and dangers is not just a community, and it doesn't just need an organizer. </p> <p>And though both Senator Obama and Senator Biden have been going on lately about how they are always, quote, \"fighting for you,\" let us face the matter squarely. </p> <p>There is only one man in this election who has ever really fought for you ... in places where winning means survival and defeat means death ... and that man is John McCain. In our day, politicians have readily shared much lesser tales of adversity than the nightmare world in which this man, and others equally brave, served and suffered for their country. </p> <p>It's a long way from the fear and pain and squalor of a six-by-four cell in Hanoi to the Oval Office.</p> <p>But if Senator McCain is elected president, that is the journey he will have made. </p> <p>It's the journey of an upright and honourable man - the kind of fellow whose name you will find on war memorials in small towns across this country, only he was among those who came home. </p> <p>To the most powerful office on earth, he would bring the compassion that comes from having once been powerless ... the wisdom that comes even to the captives, by the grace of God ... the special confidence of those who have seen evil, and seen how evil is overcome. A fellow prisoner of war, a man named Tom Moe of Lancaster, Ohio, recalls looking through a pin-hole in his cell door as lieutenant commander John McCain was led down the hallway, by the guards, day after day.</p> <p>As the story is told, \"When McCain shuffled back from torturous interrogations, he would turn toward Moe's door and flash a grin and thumbs up\" - as if to say, \"We're going to pull through this\". My fellow Americans, that is the kind of man America needs to see us through these next four years. </p> <p>For a season, a gifted speaker can inspire with his words.</p> <p>For a lifetime, John McCain has inspired with his deeds.</p> <p>If character is the measure in this election ... and hope the theme ... and change the goal we share, then I ask you to join our cause. Join our cause and help America elect a great man as the next president of the United States.</p> <p>Thank you all, and may God bless America.</p>",

We're in for a night of liberal-bashing speeches from a trio of presidential failures, and then the big event of the evening, Sarah Palin's keynote speech, which will be received with adulation in the hall even if she reads from a telephone directory \u2014 but the content of which may count for a lot in the country at large.</p> <p><strong>8.07pm</strong>: Romney is railing against \"the eastern elites... the editorial pages of the Times and the Post, and the broadcasters from the east coast.\" Instead he advocates looking west... to Alaska. Northwest, surely?</p> <p><strong>8.09pm (all times local)</strong>: \"Is a Supreme Court liberal or conservative that awards Guantanamo terrorists with constitutional rights? It's liberal! Is a government liberal or conservative that puts the interests of the teachers union ahead of the needs of our children? \u2014 It's liberal!... We need change all right - change from a liberal Washington to a conservative Washington!\" We've got a whole call-and-response thing going on now.</p> <p><strong>8.14pm</strong>: \"China is acting like Adam Smith on steroids.\"</p> <p><strong>8.18pm</strong>: \"I know what makes jobs come, and I know what makes them go.\" What made jobs come and go often enough in the past, as Ezra Klein <a href=\"http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=09&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=public_equity_and_you\">points out</a>, has been the noted private equity firm chief executive <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitt_Romney#Business_career\">Mitt Romney</a>.</p> <p><strong>8.19pm</strong>: \"Just like you, there has never been a day when I was not proud to be an American. We inherited the greatest nation in the history of the earth.\" Many muscular chants of \"USA! USA!\". Take that, Michelle Obama.</p> <p><strong>8.22pm</strong>: And now they're all clapping and dancing to a song called <a href=\"http://www.songlyrics.com/song-lyrics/Rodney_Atkins/Miscellaneous/If_You_re_Going_Through_Hell_(Before_The_Devil_Even_Knows)/255674.html\">If You're Going Through Hell,</a> which seems... oddly chosen.</p> <p><strong>8.26pm</strong>: All this music is about roughnecks and cowboys and the West, backing up the message of hard-drinking \u2014 no, hang on a second! \u2014 teetotal roughneck Mitt Romney. And yet the fact is that I am eating a chicken salad with lettuce and olives, and that you can buy lattes and espressos in the press centre here, which you certainly couldn't in Denver. The Republican convention is elitist.</p> <p><strong>8.29pm</strong>: Here's Mike Huckabee, sneerily thanking \"the elite media\" for doing something he thought \"couldn't be done\" \u2014 uniting the party behind McCain/Palin. (That's a rather double-edged compliment, when you think about it.) The reporting has been \"tackier than a costume change at a Madonna concert\" \u2014 that's revenge for <a href=\"http://ukpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5gH5l-Singpk9F7-gUBHv0qOYYsxA\">this</a>.</p> <p><strong>8.32pm</strong>: Mike Huckabee <em>actually just said this</em>: \"My Dad lifted heavy things\". And this: \"I was in college before I found out it wasn't supposed to hurt to take a shower.\" It's something to do with having to clean himself with stones, because he grew up so poor. But this is an almost entirely crazy speech, I'm afraid to say. That's an unbiased opinion.</p> <p><strong>8.36pm</strong>: \"Sarah Palin got more votes running for mayor of Wasilla than Joe Biden got running for president.\" Laughter and cheers. I keep pointing this out, but apparently the Republican top brass aren't reading this blog: you can't simultaneously praise Palin's experience while getting a laugh from it because of its smallness. Well, you can, but I will call you out for logical inconsistency.</p> <p><strong>8.38pm</strong>: BREAKING NEWS: John McCain is a war hero! Oh. My. God. Now we are hearing some utterly batty story about a teacher called Martha who wouldn't let her students have a desk unless they could tell her how to earn it. Hard work and good behaviour wasn't enough. Nobody could guess the answer. Eventually she revealed that the answer was... </p> <p>\"Martha opened the door of her classroom. In walked 27 veterans, some wearing uniforms from years gone by, but each one carrying a school desk. As they carefully and quietly arranged the desks in neat rows, Martha said, 'You don't have to earn your desks\u2026these guys already did.'\"</p> <p>What? WHAT? I understand the idea that the military defends our freedom, but this desk parable thing is just baffling. Did this actually happen? Did someone fire the teacher? Now he's explaining that John McCain enabled him, Mike Huckabee, to have a school desk. I'm sorry, I'm almost incoherent with confusion and must pause for a few moments. Luckily it's the governor of Hawai'i now, so it's a good opportunity for that.</p> <p><strong>8.50pm</strong>: Themes of the evening so far: xenophobia, \"anti-elitist\" rabble-rousing, media-bashing, smalltown boosterism versus liberal city people. Pretty unpleasant, all told. </p> <p>Shortly, we'll be hearing from Rudy Giuliani, and right now the Hawa'iian governor is setting us up for that by talking a lot about Palin's experience as a mayor. Then comes Giuliani, a mayor. And thus a mental connection is forged...</p> <p>\"You can fit more than 250 states the size of [Joe Biden's home state,] Delaware within the borders of Alaska!\" says Linda Lingle, the governor of Hawai'i, thereby <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/sep/01/uselections2008.palin2\">adopting the talking point I suggested yesterday</a>.</p> <p>\"PALIN POWER!\" says one of the handmade signs the crowd's waving. I wonder if it's one of the handmade signs you see Republican party operatives blatantly handing out to delegates on the way in here...</p> <p><strong>9.01pm</strong>: Rudy! Rudy! Rudy! He's here to scare us all about the terrorist threat.</p> <p>\"The American people realize this election represents a turning point. In two months they will decide the future direction of our nation. It's a decision to follow one path or another. We the people, the citizens of the United States, get to decide our next president. Not the leftwing media, not Hollywood celebrities, not anyone else, but the people of America!\" </p> <p><strong>9.05pm</strong>: Voting for a president is like hiring someone to protect your family from danger and evil, and also danger. McCain has sacrificed for America \"as few do,\" he says, with real aggression in his voice. </p> <p>Wait, wait, wait, WHAT? John McCain <strong>was a prisoner of war</strong>. He has proved his commitment with his blood. On the other hand, Obama worked as a \"community organizer\". \"What?\" says Giuliani, pretending not to understand. He laughs unpleasantly. The crowd laughs. \"Then he ran for the state legislature - where nearly 130 times he was unable to make a decision yes or no. It was too tough. He voted 'present.' I didn't know about this 'vote present' when I was mayor of New York City. Sarah Palin didn't get to vote present when she was mayor or governor.\"</p> <p>\"Barack Obama has never led anything. Nothing. Nada. Nada. Nothing.\" This is real, jeering anti-Obama stuff, the nastiest we've heard, and the delegates are loving it \u2014 yelping and whooping.</p> <p><strong>9.11pm</strong>: Ezra Klein <a href=\"http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=09&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=elite_media\">makes</a> a good point about the night's attacks on the \"elite media\": \"The point here is not to get votes: Americans aren't very worried about the \"elite media,\" whoever that is. It's to initimidate the media. Scare them. Suggest that they'll be locked out of access, cordoned off from stories, beaten down by Fox News. This is an attack on the media. The question now is how insecure the media really is.\"</p> <p><strong>9.17pm</strong>: 9/11 9/11 9/11 9/11 9/11. Giuliani gets huge applause for arguing that the Democrats in Denver were too weak to attack Islamic terrorism, owing to political correctness. The gloves are off tonight.</p> <p><strong>9.18pm</strong>: If you say the war in Iraq is lost, you are saying that Osama bin Laden has won, and that makes you a terrorist. Or something like that. </p> <p>There's something rather troubling about the way in which Giuliani enjoys the roiling up the audience. He claps softly to himself, and chuckles.</p> <p>9/11, terrorism, Israel. Rudy is just listing general concepts now, in a row.</p> <p><strong>9.24pm</strong>: \"I'm sorry that Barack Obama feels [Sarah Palin's] hometown isn't <em>cosmopolitan</em> enough. I'm sorry it's not <em>flashy</em> enough. Maybe they cling to religion there,\" says the former mayor of New York City who lived for years in one of the best townhouses on the Upper East Side. Maybe there is a point at which what you're saying becomes so indefensibly absurd that it meets up round the other side and becomes sensible?</p> <p>...And then more of this stuff about shaking up Washington, as if the current president was not a Republican. </p> <p>\"How dare they question whether Sarah Palin has enough time to be with her children and be vice-president?\" (I really haven't come across this criticism much.) \"When do they ever ask a man that question?\" </p> <p><strong>9.29pm:</strong> Sarah Palin walks on stage. The crowd are uncontrollable, completely uncontrollable with ecstasy. She swiftly slaughters a moose, and then two minutes later the noise subsides and she begins.</p> <p><strong>9.32pm:</strong> \"I will be honoured to accept your nomination for vice-president of the United States.\" Picking up the evening's theme, she slates the \"pollsters and the pundants\" [sic] who overlooked John McCain's \"determination, resolve, and sheer guts.\" Her son gets a namecheck \u2014 he's off to Iraq soon \u2014 and stands to receive a portion of the almost constant applause. \"One week from tomorrow, September 11th, he'll deploy to Iraq.\"</p> <p><strong>9.36pm:</strong> \"Track is the eldest of our five children...\" and now introductions for Bristol, Willow and Piper, who all look rather overwhelmed. And \"a perfectly beautiful baby boy named Trig.\" (Todd Palin's holding him.) \"From the inside, no family ever seems typical. Our family has the same ups and downs and any others. Sometimes even the greatest joys bring challenge. And children with special needs inspire a very, very special love.\" Wait a minute, I thought the families were off limits? </p> <p><strong>9.42pm:</strong> She grew up among people who are \"always proud of America,\" she says, echoing Romney's anti-Michelle Obama line from earlier. \"I was just your average hockey mom, and signed up for the PTA...\" (\"Hockey Mom! Hockey Mom!\" the crowd shout.) \"I love those hockey moms, you know, they say, the difference between a hockey mom and a pitbull? Lipstick.\" OK. \"When I ran for city council, I didn't need focus groups...\" The strategy here is fairly straightforward. \"I was mayor of our hometown, and since our opponents seem to look down on that experience, let me explain to them what the job involves...</p> <p>\"I guess a smalltown mayor is sort of like a community organizer, except that you have actual responsibilities.\" There's your zinger of the evening. </p> <p>...Wait, somebody just got dragged off the floor by security. More on that if I figure out what was going on.</p> <p><strong>9.45pm</strong>: \"Some in the media\" consider her unqualified. Boos, of a rather goodnatured variety. \"NBC! NBC!\" someone's shouting, loudly. Hmm, this media war could backfire yet. \"No... uh... oh...\" Palin seems briefly confused by something, but soon recovers. </p> <p><strong>9.48pm</strong>: Her message here, looking back at her time in Alaska, is that she's a reformer, a challenger from outside; clearly, outsiderhood is a prerequisite for that, and too much \"experience\" could be a problem. Also, she sold the governor's jet on eBay, we learn yet again. \"I love to drive myself to work, and I thought we could muddle through without the governor's personal chef.\" It's very odd, listening to a serviceable but not amazing public speech being received as if it is the best oratory the world has ever heard.</p> <p><strong>9.57pm</strong>: Excuse me, my computer crashed. Now, after a passage on energy \u2014&#xa0;drill, drill, drill!, essentially, and as commenter Wikipedia notes, a <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSN3125537020080901  \">misrepresentation</a> of her position on the \"Bridge to Nowhere\" -- we're into the Obama attack part.</p> <p>\"We've all heard his dramatic speeches before devoted followers. And there is much to like and admire about our opponent. But listening to him speak, it's easy to forget that this is a man who has authored two memoirs but not a single major law or reform - not even in the state senate. This is a man who can give an entire speech about the wars America is fighting, and never use the word 'victory' except when he's talking about his own campaign. But when the cloud of rhetoric has passed, when the roar of the crowd fades away, when the stadium lights go out, and those styrofoam Greek columns are hauled back to some studio lot - what exactly is our opponent's plan?\" \u2014 essentially, it's talking to evil terrorists, weakening America, and increasing taxes: lots and lots of taxes.</p> <p>It's a relentless attack on Obama as effete, self-absorbed, treating the presidential campaign as a \"journey of personal discovery\". And of McCain as a maverick who has the Washington lobbyists shaking in their boots. What strange times we live in...</p> <p><strong>10.02pm</strong>: \"And though both Senator Obama and Senator Biden have been going on lately about how they are always, quote, 'fighting for you,' let us face the matter squarely. There is only one man in this election who has ever really fought for you, in places where winning means survival and defeat means death, and that man is John McCain... It's a long way from the fear and pain and squalor of a six-by-four cell in Hanoi to the Oval Office. But if Senator McCain is elected president, that is the journey he will have made.\" JOHN MCCAIN WAS A PRISONER OF WAR, PEOPLE! I really don't know how many times you have to be told before it gets through.</p> <p>\"For a season, a gifted speaker can inspire with his words. For a lifetime, John McCain has inspired with his deeds... I ask you to join our cause. Join our cause and help America elect a great man as the next president of the United States. Thank you all, and may God bless America.\" Insane levels of applause and chants of \"Sa-rah!\", \"Sa-rah!\", and the whole Palin family join her on stage. Palin wields Trig aloft. This speech has been the first time here that I've seen anything to rival Denver levels of enthusiasm.</p> <p><strong>10.12pm</strong> And in a parallel to Obama's surprise arrival at the end of Joe Biden's speech, here's John McCain. \"Tremendous, tremendous, fantastic, tremendous,\" he says, vaguely hugging the Palins. \"Don't you think we made the right choice for the next vice-president of the United States? And what a beautiful family!\" Militaristic music. McCain and Palin are both doing an awful Republican version of Hillary Clinton's already sufficiently awful pointing-and-smiling thing.</p> <p>Shortly, these psyched-up delegates will hold a roll-call vote officially to nominate McCain. First, three country singers including <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rich_(musician)\">John Rich</a> are reading out random bits of famous American speeches and documents, in between lines of the national anthem. Extremely strange. </p> <p>Brilliant, now Rich is singing his criminally stupid song Raising McCain. </p> <p><strong>10.25pm</strong> ...Well, I don't know. As a foreigner, a European, a non-prisoner of war, an elitist and an employee of the media, I'm the enemy, so it would be strange if I responded to that speech with overwhelming joy. But you do have to wonder how this stuff will play at the moderate margin, the place we're led to believe that the votes in this election will be won. If there are indeed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/sep/04/sarahpalin.johnmccain\">two hopelessly incompatible Americas</a>, how do you find the balance, tactically speaking, between energising the base and alienating the centre?</p> <p>Josh Marshall <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/213128.php\">reckons</a> this is \"a sign that the McCain campaign has abandoned an effort to compete for swing voters and go back to the base energising strategy that worked for President Bush in 2004. The numbers make that look like a tough proposition. But I think a few months from now, everyone will agree this was a mistake.\" He also points out that Rudy Giuliani must have overrun, because the schedulers abandoned a video tribute to Palin. (Marshall on Giuliani: \"I know the people in the hall loved it. But I think a lot of people will see it as whacked. Rancid. Curdled.\")</p> <p>Then again, at the wonderful little playpen of conservatism that is <a href=\"http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZTUyZjg4MTE1ZGIwNDBmN2MwMWU4MzY4NjlmNzQ5YzA=\">The Corner</a>: \"Is it me, or is this one just a whole 'nother level of maturity and seriousness compared to the Dem convention?\" And <a href=\"http://www.commentarymagazine.com/blogs/index.php/jpodhoretz/26561\">John Podhoretz</a>: \"In terms of impact, I would say this speech is easily the equal of Obama's in 2004.\" But Andrew Sullivan passes along <a href=\"http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/09/email-of-the-ni.html\">one anecdotal hint</a> of a moderate Republican feeling alienated by tonight's speeches.</p> <p><strong>10.50pm</strong>: On the US cable networks, which I haven't been watching during tonight's proceedings, the much-repeated phrase about Palin, apparently, is \"A Star Is Born.\"</p> <p>...Well, this election just got a whole lot nastier, I think, if the Republicans are indeed giving up on any attempt to win over the centre, and instead returning to the base-focused strategies of 2000 and 2004, and declaring war on the media, and on the coastal elites, and an big city dwellers, and on liberals (even though Rudy Giuliani is most of these, and McCain in many respects, for that matter). Questions: will it work? How do the calls for bipartisanship we've seen over the last few days fit with that? They don't, obviously, but will the contradiction be problematic for the Republicans? And how does the Obama campaign respond \u2014 get fiercer, or reach for moral high ground? </p> <p>McCain won the roll call vote, by the way. He's now officially the nominee.</p> <p>POSTSCRIPT</p> <p><strong>11.40pm</strong>: As a liberal European elitist journalist currently residing on the east coast of the United States, I wasn't relishing heading out into the crowds of elated delegates. Turned out I needn't have worried, though: \"You British are different,\" one Colorado delegate told me, grinning. \"You're not as bad as the other Europeans.\"</p> <p>Three preliminary conclusions from my conversations and eavesdroppings:</p> <p>1. They're thrilled. <em>Thrilled.</em> Not the glistening eyes of Invesco Field, perhaps, but it's real, tingly excitement, and it's all about Palin.<br>2. The \"reform\" line that Palin made plain tonight is crucial to them. It's what justifies McCain's selection of an outsider; alchemically, it turns a lack of experience into a plus point.<br>3. They don't see \u2014 or admit to seeing, anyhow \u2014 any contradiction between tonight's high-octane partisanship and last night's call to rise above politics.</p> <p>\"Fantastic. Just fantastic,\" said John Carson, a Colorado delegate. \"There were a lot of good speeches, but Palin was just fantastic. She showed strength, she's obviously bright, she understands energy issues \u2014 she really projected the image of a leader tonight.\" Did the partisan tone run counter to the call to rise above politics? \"That's more a question of how you govern when you're in office \u2014 talking to the other side when you need to,\" he said. \"We're here to nominate our candidate and to win an election, so you're going to get partisanship.\"</p> <p>Lynn Hosemann, a Mississippi delegate: \"I'm so excited! She showed she had the right concept of governing: to serve the people. That's what government should be about. It shouldn't be self-serving. She's a reformer, and she showed she could take on the existing Washington establishment.\" But hasn't the Washington establishment been headed by a Republican for eight years? \"It's not just about the last eight years. We have become a government of professional politicians. We need citizen servants. She is a citizen servant!\" </p> <p>Some people sounded almost as if they'd prefer Palin to be running as president.</p> <p>Many more responses in Daniel Nasaw's piece, available <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uselections\">here</a>, soon.</p> <p>Goodnight \u2014 thanks for reading and commenting.</p>"
