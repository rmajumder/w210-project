  "<p>Barack Obama is opening a clear lead over John McCain after polls at the weekend showed the public overwhelmingly awarding Friday night's presidential debate to the Democratic candidate.</p> <p>The polls suggest McCain did not benefit from suspending his campaign and flying to Washington last week to help deal with the financial crisis.</p> <p>The gap could see an increase in more personal - and ugly - attacks on Obama. An early sign of that came yesterday in a row over a dead soldier's bracelet. Obama was accused of wearing the bracelet against the wishes of the soldier's mother.</p> <p>With five weeks until the presidential election, Obama appears to have broken the impasse that had seen the two in a dead heat in polls over the past month.</p> <p>A USA Today poll, published yesterday, showed 45% of those questioned felt Obama had done better in the debate than McCain, who registered 34%. The public view is at odds with the media, which overwhelmingly judged it to be a draw.</p> <p>Other polls, including the Rasmussen tracking poll, showed voters drifting towards Obama. The Rasmussen poll put Obama on 50% and McCain on 44%, which would give the Democratic candidate a landslide victory.</p> <p>McCain returned to the campaign trail yesterday alongside his vice-presidential running mate, Sarah Palin, for the first time since suspending his campaign last Wednesday.</p> <p>In a speech in Ohio, McCain stuck to his main message of whether Obama was fit to be president, saying the Democratic candidate had always voted with the party and had shown no sign of putting his country first. He also accused him of lying about tax plans in Friday's debate.</p> <p>As the election nears, the two campaigns are firing back more claims and denials, and at increasing speed. Obama's team's denial on tax was out before McCain had completed his speech.</p> <p>If Obama maintains his lead, the Republicans are almost certain to step up personal attacks on him. In a column for the New York Times yesterday, the rightwing commentator William Kristol, editor of the Weekly Standard, offered suggestions on how McCain could win that included raising again Obama's links with figures such as the Reverend Jeremiah Wright, the controversial cleric.</p> <p>An early sign that the campaign could turn more personal was yesterday's row over Obama's possession of the bracelet of a US soldier killed in Iraq. Stories quickly appeared on the internet suggesting the mother objected to Obama exploiting her son's death. </p> <p>During the debate, McCain said a soldier's mother had given him a bracelet. \"I've got a bracelet too, from Sergeant ... from the mother of Sergeant Ryan David Jopek, given to me in Green Bay,\" said Obama.</p> <p>The mother, Tracy Jopek, told AP yesterday she was \"ecstatic\" that Obama had mentioned her son. \"I don't understand how people can take that and turn it into some garbage on the internet,\" she said.</p> <p>She had asked Obama in February not to mention her son, but she felt it was appropriate on Friday in response to McCain.</p> <p>Obama and McCain have established what they refer to as truth squads, each offering quick rebuttals to what they see as incorrect claims.</p>",
  "<p>Angry Republican leaders blamed Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives, last night for shattering a mood of bipartisan cooperation and destroying the US government's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/wallstreet\">$700bn financial bail-out package</a>.</p> <p>Keen to shake off responsibility for failing to deliver votes from their own members, embarrassed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/republicans\">Republicans</a> said a feisty speech by Pelosi had been so offensive that some of their number shifted sides and voted against the plan at the last moment.</p> <p>\"I do believe we could have got there today, had it not been for this partisan speech that the Speaker gave on the floor of the House,\" said John Boehner, the Republican leader in the House.</p> <p>A 68-year-old San Francisco liberal, Pelosi is known for being outspoken: in the past, she has raised eyebrows by bluntly describing George Bush as \"incompetent\".</p> <p>In her speech to the House yesterday, she delivered a broadside against seven years of \"budgetary recklessness\" by the White House for creating America's economic mess.</p> <p>\"When was the last time someone asked you for $700bn?\" she asked. </p> <p>\"It is a number that is staggering, but tells us only the costs of the Bush administration's failed economic policies - policies built on budgetary recklessness, on an anything goes mentality with no regulation, no supervision and no discipline in the system.\"</p> <p>Pulling few punches, Pelosi said her party believed in the free market - but the market had \"created chaos\" because it had been left entirely to its own devices.</p> <p>\"It is our responsibility today to help avert that catastrophic outcome,\" she said.</p> <p>Pelosi is the third most senior politician in the US, ranking behind the vice-president, Dick Cheney, in the line of succession for the presidency.</p> <p>An Italian-American mother of five and a grandmother of six, she is the first woman to have held the office of Speaker.</p> <p>She is disliked by many on the right who view her as the essence of California liberalism: pro-choice, pro-gay and anti-war.</p> <p>But others say that since taking office when the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/democrats\">Democrats</a> took control of Congress two years ago, she has shown notes of moderation by consistently blocking efforts to impeach Bush.</p> <p>Railing against her words yesterday, the Republican whip, Eric Cantor, said Pelosi had \"frankly struck a tone of partisanship that was inappropriate in this discussion\". He continued: \"There is a reason that this vote failed - and that is Speaker Pelosi's speech.\"</p> <p>A fellow Republican, Roy Blunt, suggested that a dozen congressmen from his own party had changed their minds after hearing Pelosi's words.</p> <p>But the Speaker was quickly backed by her colleagues who accused Republicans of casting around for a scapegoat to cover their own humiliation in being defied by two-thirds of their own party.</p> <p>\"I'm appalled that because somebody hurt their feelings, they decided to punish the entire country,\" said Barney Frank, Democratic chairman of the House financial services committee. </p> <p>\"I would not have imputed that degree of pettiness and hyper-sensitivity.\"</p> <p>Rahm Emmanuel, chairman of the Democratic caucus in the House, said nobody should be \"pointing fingers\" given the seriousness of the economic warnings descending upon Congress.</p> <p>The outbreak of hostilities came after a weekend of rare cooperation in which leaders from both parties burned midnight oil in an attempt to strike a deal which could be supported by their backbenchers.</p> <p>At one stage late on Saturday night, the two parties met in Pelosi's office over a platter of pizza and sandwiches to try to come to agreement.</p> <p>To many observers, Republicans appeared to be the architects of yesterday's defeat. </p> <p>Some 60% of Democrats voted for the bail-out, compared with only a third of the Republicans in Congress. But Pelosi was not the only person whom rightwingers attempted to blame.</p> <p>On the presidential campaign trail, John McCain said that it was time to \"fix the problem\" rather than apportion responsibility. But his chief economic adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, accused Barack Obama of failing to get involved in negotiations to fashion an acceptable package.</p> <p>\"Barack Obama failed to lead, phoned it in, attacked John McCain, and refused to even say if he supported the bill,\" said Holtz-Eakin.</p> <p>The Obama campaign reacted with irritation. A spokesman for Obama said the Republicans' \"angry and hyper-partisan\" utterances were exactly why Americans are \"disgusted with Washington\".</p> <p>\"Now is the time for Democrats and Republicans to join together and act in a way that prevents an economic catastrophe,\" Obama's camp said.</p>",

It was a fascinating, beautiful journey that brought me in contact with a broad range of Americana.</p> <p>I returned the day after the election to my home in Brooklyn, New York, where crestfallen friends and neighbours struggled to comprehend Bush's narrow victory. They questioned me as though I was an anthropologist who had been roaming around the hinterland questioning the natives. \"What were they thinking?\" \"How could they do this?\" \"What is wrong with them?\"</p> <p>These questions seemed to refer to a foreign country with which they were not only unfamiliar, but which in many ways seemed to frighten them. </p> <p>So this time round, rather than drop in on middle America, I decided to stick around in a town of the kind where the 2008 campaign would be decided. For the next few weeks I'll be in Roanoke, Virginia, a former railway town of almost 100,000 people that nestles in a valley between the Blue Ridge mountains and the Appalachians. I'll be trying to get a sense of how the issues here relate to what is going on nationally and vice-versa.</p> <p>Why Roanoke? It's a relatively small town in a swing state with a sizeable African-American population. The poverty is slightly higher and the wages slightly lower than the US average. </p> <p>As the largest town in the state for more than 100 miles in any direction, it is big enough to have its own airport. But it is small enough that a large proportion of the people flying seem to know each other and the staff quite well. The people seem friendly and a little eccentric. I hope those impressions hold.

  "<p>Sarah Palin was set to enter the confines of John McCain's ranch in Arizona yesterday for three days of intensive preparations ahead of her showdown against Joe Biden in this week's vice-presidential television debate. Thursday night's match in St Louis, Missouri, will bring McCain's running mate her moment of greatest national exposure since the virtual unknown joined the Republican ticket for the White House.</p> <p>Though vice-presidential debates seldom influence an election, Palin's novelty raises the importance of the clash with her Democratic party counterpart. The debate offers a chance for her to redeem herself after a number of damaging press reports and disastrous TV interviews - or to self-destruct if she fails to hold her own against the far more experienced Biden.</p> <p>In a parting shot before she entered the seclusion of the ranch for the debate rehearsals, Palin told a rally in Columbus, Ohio, yesterday that she was excited about the encounter. \"I'm looking forward to meeting Joe Biden. I've been hearing about him since second grade,\" she said.</p> <p>But the bravado belies the intense pressure on Palin to deliver a credible performance, and the efforts campaign aides have made to get her up to speed. A team of senior aides has been at her side for days, hunkering down in Philadelphia at the weekend and travelling with her yesterday. </p> <p>At first glance, the debate might look like an unequal fight. Biden has been a ubiquitous figure in Washington for 36 years; Palin was virtually unknown outside her native Alaska until 33 days ago. A Wall Street Journal poll last week found that 49% of Americans thought Palin fit to be vice-president, against 64% for Biden.</p> <p>But Biden faces challenges as well in the first national debate between male and female candidates since Geraldine Ferraro ran for vice-president in 1984. He has been rehearsing against Jennifer Granholm, the governor of Michigan, to prepare for the gender dynamics.</p> <p>\"[Palin] has to show command of her material. She has to show preparedness to take on the presidency, and she has to show more intellectual gravitas than she has shown so far,\" said Alan Schroeder, a professor at North Eastern University who has written a book about 40 years of presidential debates. \"[Biden] has the problem of high expectations versus his opponent's low expectations.\"</p> <p>Though wildly popular with hardcore Republicans, Palin has become a butt of late-night comics for her insistence that Alaska's proximity to Russia gives her some insight into international affairs.</p> <p>The conservative commentator David Brooks called her candidacy \"embarrassing\" and Newsweek's Fareed Zakaria said her answers on the economy in a CBS interview last week were \"gibberish\".</p> <p>Yesterday even Mitt Romney, a former Republican candidate for the White House, admitted that the campaign had mishandled Palin by keeping her from the media and trying to make her stick to scripted answers. \"Holding Sarah Palin to just three interviews and microscopically focusing on each I think has been a mistake,\" he told MSNBC. \"They'd be a lot wiser to let Sarah Palin be Sarah Palin. Let her talk to the media, talk to people.\" </p> <p>Palin's claim to be a crusader for reform has also been shaken by further investigation into her record in Alaska. The Associated Press reported yesterday that Palin got exemption from zoning regulations to make it easier to sell her home in Wasilla. As a small town mayor, she made it a habit to accept gifts such as a facial, flowers and even fresh salmon from local merchants.</p> <p>Palin also faces questions about policy splits. Unlike McCain, she supports drilling in the Arctic wildlife refuge and only recently admitted a human role in global warming. She also opposes stem cell research, which McCain supports.</p> <p>Such differences could prove embarrassing to Biden as well. When he was running for the White House earlier this year, Biden said he did not think Obama was ready to be president.</p> <p>He has broken with the campaign on clean coal technology, and committed a number of gaffes. Earlier this month, he embarrassed Obama and himself by saying that Hillary Clinton would have made a better vice-presidential candidate.</p> <p>But perhaps his greatest challenge is to guard against being perceived as overbearing or condescending to a younger female candidate. This is especially true in the case of Palin, whose relative inexperience could make women viewers feel protective of her.</p> <p>Such factors have also come into play in debates with the most seasoned women politicians. Hillary Clinton, widely considered the Democrats' best debater, won her 2000 Senate debate when her opponent, Rick Lazio, came up to her and waved a sheaf of papers in her face. The invasion of Clinton's personal space outraged women viewers and made Lazio seem like a bully.</p> <p>George Bush Sr lost his debate against Ferraro in 1984 the moment he decided to give her a lecture about the difference between Lebanon and Iran.</p> <p>Ferraro, who had several years experience as a New York prosecutor and congresswoman on her resume, would have none of it. \"I almost resent, Vice-President Bush, your patronising attitude that you have to teach me about foreign policy,\" she shot back.</p> <p>The gaffe-prone Biden would also do well to remember that Bush dug himself even deeper into the hole the next day by bragging to a bunch of dockers that he had \"kicked a little ass\" in the debate.</p>",
  "<p>\"God is merciful,\" said Issa, after Melik had reluctantly sheltered him. Melik looked confused as he searched Issa's possessions and found $500. \"Perhaps he's a terrorist,\" he thought. \"I could be deported if he's discovered.\"</p> <p>Tommy Brue sighed. It was tough being the thoroughly decent 60-year-old head of the family bank whose life was about to be turned upside down.</p> <p>\"I'm Annabel Richter, a lawyer for a charity for displaced persons,\" she said. \"We must discuss the Lipizanner account. I have a client in bad shape.\"</p> <p>The Hamburg Intelligence Unit became aware of Issa on his fourth day in the city. \"It's time for the big speech about how everything has changed in espionage since 9/11,\" said Gunther Bachman. \"We can't arse-lick religious nutters any more. We've got to use some tradecraft and turn a Jihadi.\"</p> <p>Annabel took Brue to meet Issa. So this is Colonel Karpov's son, he thought.</p> <p> \"I spit on my father,\" Issa said. \"He robbed the Chechens. I want to become a doctor.\"</p> <p>\"You've got to help him claim his money,\" Annabel insisted. \"If he's sent back to Russia, he'll die.\"</p> <p>Brue's mind was made up. Who cared if there were more holes in this story than the Berlin Wall? Narrative and morality were just shades of grey. He'd always been ashamed his father had sold out the bank to Russian gangsters, and the purity of Annabel's purpose offered him redemption. Besides, she had nice legs.</p> <p>\"You can hide out at my flat,\" said Annabel to Issa. </p> <p>\"Thank Allah,\" Melik muttered. \"Now he's off my hands I can go to my sister's wedding in Turkey.\"</p> <p>Brue had a bad weekend, weighed down by the usual sexual humiliation inflicted on Le Carr\u00e9's lonely leading men by their wives. \"Aha,\" said the mysterious Mr Lantern over lunch. \"I'm with MI6. Your father laundered money from Russian agents for us.\"</p> <p>Annabel was obsessed with Issa. He was the one she wanted to save. He was the one who would save her. \"He's an Islamic terrorist,\" Bachman said to Annabel. \"The only chance to save yourself and him is to help us turn him. Make him take the money.\"</p> <p>Brue thought of Annabel. Maybe she could love him? \"You've no chance,\" she snapped. \"And neither do you,\" Issa said. \"I'm a good Muslim boy.\"</p> <p>Bachman smiled when he saw Lantern. MI6 were on to Issa as well. No matter. They could work together. But what was the CIA doing at this meeting? It was all about to go horribly wrong. The Yanks were nothing but trouble to liberal thriller writers. They didn't get moral ambivalence.</p> <p>\"We want Issa to give his money to Abdullah the Muslim cleric,\" Bachman said. \"People think he's a moderate and 95% of what he does is good. But 5% is bad. We need to debate whether 5% is a bit bad or very bad.\"</p> <p>\"We're only going to work for you,\" said Brue and Annabel, \"if you promise to be nice to Issa as he's a nice chap really.\"</p> <p>\"OK,\" said Issa. \"I will give my money to Abdullah but only on condition that no one asks why I appeared to be hesitating as I only came to Hamburg in the first place to give my money to the Chechens and if no one gets to find out if I am a terrorist or not.\"</p> <p>\"Allah be praised,\" said Abdullah, pocketing the cheque for $12.5m. \"I'll make sure the Chechens get a bit, some other Muslims get a lot and a mysterious bank account in Cyprus gets 5%.\"</p> <p>Bachman rubbed his hands. At last he was going to get a chance to turn a Muslim fundamentalist. \"Not so fast,\" yelled the Yanks. \"This is extraordinary rendition. We can't be arsed with your Europygmy softball. We're taking Abdullah and Issa. And Melik can forget coming back to Germany.\"</p> <p>\"That's all a bit previous,\" Bachman said, \"If you always planned to kidnap them, why didn't you get on and do it 100 pages ago?\"</p> <p>\"What?\" the Yanks replied. \"And deny you the chance to go on and on about the complexities of modern terrorism?\"</p> <p>\"Mmm,\" said Annabel and Brue. \"Life can be very diffy.\"</p> <p><strong>The digested read, digested:</strong> Principled uncertainties.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Hear the digested read podcast at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books+content/audio\">theguardian.com/audio</a></p>",

Like many Brits (and not a few Americans), he's expressed gloom about the choice of <strong>Sarah Palin</strong> as <strong>John McCain's</strong> running mate - \"she makes George Bush look like Karl Marx\" - and harbours doubts about whether <strong>Barack Obama</strong> will win. Admittedly, the interview was conducted three weeks ago, before the financial crisis, but Schama said: \"I think McCain will win. The one thing everyone believed was that Obama had balls of steel. No one thought he would lie back while various forms of the Sarah Palin bull terrier snapped at his ankles or more important parts of his political anatomy ... at this stage you don't win elections by giving philosophy lectures ... he needs a little blood on his fingertips.\" Fortuitously, the history prof has the solution to hand: \"If Obama can make the election about election history in the spirit of what we've tried to do in this series - he will win.\"</p> <p>Congratulations to one of Europe's most enduring politicians, <strong>Wilfried Martens,</strong> former Christian Democrat prime minister of Belgium - about whom <strong>Margaret Thatcher</strong> was famously dismissive in her memoirs - who has finally married his longstanding mistress, <strong>Miet Smet</strong>, who also happens to have been a Belgian employment and environment minister. The liaison, formalised in a civil ceremony in Flanders at the weekend, was an open secret in the Low Countries, where it certainly did not hinder Martens' career even when his former wife, <strong>Ilse Schouteden</strong>, tried to derail his elevation to the European People's party presidency by claiming his proximity to his lover during European parliament sessions in Strasbourg would place him in moral danger.

  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338105841\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>The US government's $700bn bail-out of the banking industry collapsed yesterday as Congress defied the White House by voting down the plan, sending Wall Street stocks plummeting and spreading shockwaves through the global economy.</p> <p>In a snub to George Bush's authority, Republicans in the House of Representatives led a rebellion which defeated the rescue by 228 votes to 205.</p> <p>As alarm mounted on Wall Street about the stability of the financial system, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged by 777 points to 10,365 - its biggest percentage fall for seven years and its worst drop ever in terms of points.</p> <p>The package was intended to allow the government to buy toxic mortgage-related liabilities from banks, after warning that without action banks would curtail home loans, car loans and student loans, as well as credit to keep small firms trading.</p> <p>Bush, who had spent the morning phoning wavering Republicans, made a terse statement expressing \"disappointment\" and pledged to develop a strategy to \"continue to address this economic situation head on\". The treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, said he would work on an alternative plan. \"This is much too important to simply let fail,\" he said.</p> <p>Although most Democrats in the House backed the plan, two-thirds of Republicans voted against it. Many attacked it as a perversion of free-market economics and a departure from Reagan-style liberalism.</p> <p>As recriminations began, Republican leaders blamed the Democratic speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, for framing the crisis as a consequence of recklessness by the Bush administration. \"The speaker had to give a partisan voice that poisoned our conference,\" said Republican leader John Boehner. This drew ridicule from Democrats. Barney Frank, chairman of the House financial services committee, said: \"Somebody hurt my feelings so I'll punish the country? That's hardly plausible.\"</p> <p>The negative vote is a blow to the Republican presidential candidate, John McCain, who briefly suspended his campaign last week to try to broker an agreement. He urged fresh efforts to find a deal, saying: \"Now is not time to fix the blame - it's time to fix the problem.\"</p> <p>On Wall Street, there were groans as traders gathered around TV monitors to watch the vote. \"Everybody stood their with their mouths open,\" said Sal Catrini, an executive director at JP Morgan in New York, who predicted that the uncertainty would send stocks plunging. \"We're seeing real selling, but no buyers.\"</p> <p>Fourteen commercial banks have gone bust so far this year, and yesterday another troubled high-street name, Wachovia, was rescued in a takeover by Citigroup. In a Gallup poll for USA Today, 33% of Americans said they believed the country was in a depression.</p> <p>The Mortgage Bankers' Association reacted by warning of job losses as banks curtail credit to small businesses. Larry Fink, chairman of a leading US investment management firm, BlackRock, said critics had been wrong to characterise the plan as a bail-out of Wall Street. \"This is a bail-out of Main Street,\" he said. \"Banks have no ability to lend at the moment because their balance sheets are so gummed up.\"</p> <p>The financial fallout was swift and brutal. Shares in leading US banks slumped: Bank of America by 16%, Citigroup by 12% and Goldman Sachs by 11%. Oil plunged by $10 a barrel to just over $96 as traders bet on a slump reducing the need for fuel. The dollar fell sharply and the price of gold surged close to record territory.</p> <p>Peter Morici, professor of business at the University of Maryland, said: \"Things are going to get so bad something will have to be done in the next few weeks. Banks will sink, credit markets will seize, the economy will go into something much worse than a recession.\"</p>",
  "<p>The rejection of the US government's $700bn rescue plan by the House of Representatives threw the international markets into yet another panic last night, causing a fresh plunge in shares. The Dow fell almost 600 points in a matter of minutes, opening a new nightmarish chapter in a saga that is looking more desperate by the hour. Representatives ignored pleas both from their president and from bipartisan negotiations. This has become a crisis of confidence in the banking system as a whole, which is unprecedented in modern times. It will require some equally unprecedented doomsday political manoeuvres to pull events back from the cliff edge.</p> <p>Last night's events threw a deep shadow over George Osborne's impressive Conservative conference speech yesterday. There was much to disagree with; many contradictions; an absence of detail; and, most worryingly of all, an unpersuasive grasp of what is needed now as markets crash and more banks face being blown over like trees in a storm. Neither his focus on long-term debt nor his three-card conjuring trick with council tax will ease the financial crisis now. He talked of what he would do as chancellor from 2010, without saying what he would do tonight. This was the speech of a man raising his eyes from the immediate to the moment he thinks will come, as chancellor of the exchequer in a Conservative government, facing the darkest of times. In those terms, it was a success: austere and defining. </p> <p>Echoing Anthony Crosland, he warned that \"the party is over\". Politicians everywhere are struggling to keep pace with what is happening to their world: the things that they took for granted - growth, credit, prosperity - are vanishing. Of course, Mr Osborne was as bamboozled as anyone by the magic of the City. High finance runs through Tory veins and it underwrites Tory activities, as reports that its leaders raise money from short-sellers show. Many will find it rich now to hear Mr Osborne lecture the City on responsibility, or to tell the nation that a debt-driven property boom must end, when Tory deregulation helped begin it </p> <p>But maybe this is to miss the point of what he risked yesterday, betting that voters will share his instinct that this is a time for a touch of brutal economy. His target was the public sector. He shifted the Conservatives from the sunny goodwill of David Cameron's first years to a tougher message that many will find distasteful. In doing that he may have offered Labour an opportunity, to say that the Conservative goal is to reduce the size of the state, and with it services that voters elected a Labour government to provide. Mr Osborne's talk of \"sound money\" and his claim that \"the cupboard is bare\" will play well with those who already have capital. It may prove painful for those who do not. Even yesterday's offer of a council tax freeze will not be cost free. It means a reduction in real terms in council spending. Gordon Brown has been looking for ways to define the next election around Tory cuts in services at a time when people need them most. Yesterday's speech made that easier.</p> <p>Perhaps, as Mr Osborne has decided, a much bigger change is taking place; that Labour language about investment no longer resonates with a public afraid of personal financial pain. If that is right, the contradictions in what he said may not matter. A party that preaches localism is proposing to centralise more local spending; a party that talks of the environment wants to cut car taxes; a party worried about a property boom is suggesting cutting property taxes; a shadow chancellor expert at dissecting Labour misjudgment does not admit his own. Mr Osborne does not have a plan: but then nor does anyone else, especially after the events in the US last night. It is a wretched thought, but perhaps realism is all that can be hoped for. This was a bleak speech for bleak times, growing bleaker by the hour.</p>",
  "<p>So the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/27/uselections2008.barackobama1\">great debate</a> of 2008 that almost wasn't is finally over.

It seems we've all had enough of the eight years of this runaway train, of government investigations, lawbreaking and trumped up threats of terrorism (while ignoring the real threat: anyone seen Osama bin Laden lately?). </p> <p>It is as if we all cried out in unison: \"Someone please save us from another drama queen!\"</p> <p>McCain clearly has not gotten this message. After his downright erratic behaviour last week, he showed up at the debate at Ole Miss with a chip on his shoulder. Every chance he got he took shots at Obama, often chiding him for \"not understanding\" something or other (this from a man who didn't seem to know who the president of Spain was a week ago). He refused to even look at Obama when he addressed him. He sneered, smirked and shook his head in disgust. It was as if someone took the Republican candidate and replaced him with a cross between Archie Bunker and Grandpa Simpson. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Obama was calm, cool and collected. Perhaps a bit too much, as this particular debate observer would have liked him to show a bit more fire and point out the many inconsistencies in McCain's claims when put alongside a little old thing known as reality. But he still did what he needed to do. He seemed like a statesmen, like a president. Next to a man acting as though he were going through a mid-life crisis at age 72, it was not an exceedingly hard thing to accomplish.</p> <p>McCain and Obama will debate twice more. And, with the world being a crazy place, anything can happen to change the dynamics of this race. But if Friday night - and perhaps more importantly, the last week - was any indication, Americans would seem to have finally decided they would prefer the next four years not look anything like the last eight.</p>",
  "<p>John McCain just spoke. A few sentences. No questions. Little slap at Obama. Money sentence: \"Now is not the time to fix the blame.\"</p> <p>He hopes not!<br></p>",
  "<p>Interestingly, over at the National Review's blog <a href=\"http://corner.nationalreview.com/\">The Corner</a>, the sort of insta-id of the conservative movement, they seem to be mostly worried about the no vote. Here's Rich Lowry:</p> <blockquote> <p>House Republicans will get blamed, and the likes of Mike Pence indeed played an extremely irresponsible role. But Pelosi didn't exactly make the sale with her own members, more than 90 of whom voted against it.</p> </blockquote> <p>And here's Ramesh Ponnuru:</p> <blockquote> <p>Not that it's the most important fallout, but this vote is very bad for McCain. He was trying to get House Republicans on board, after all, and he failed. Blaming the Democrats for the failure will not and should not work, given the ratios on both sides.</p> </blockquote> <p>Lowry has a point about Pelosi. However, at the end of the day, the Democrats can credibly say that they delivered enough votes to hold up their part in passing the thing, while the Republican leadership did not. Ponnuru seems right to me.</p> <p>The statement by McCain's top economic adviser, Doug Holtz-Eakin, is a joke: \"This bill failed because Barack Obama and the Democrats put politics ahead of country.\" This is one of those cases of extreme projection.<br></p>",
  "<p>With the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/30/business/30bailout.html?hp\">failure</a> today of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/29/wallstreet.marketturmoil\">$700bn economic bail-out package</a> before Congress, the Reagan Revolution died. Allowing this crisis to continue without any viable alternative represents the end of an era for the Republican party. With uncertainty growing in a market built on expectations, our economic woes will worsen. Ironically, as this crisis expands and continues to collapse major corporations, Americans will demand greater government intervention. A party whose platform opposes nearly any proposal that uses government as the medicine for a financial disease will not be able to survive this crisis.</p> <p>Politicians voted today by putting their fingers to the wind, and used ideology rather than expert advice to determine their position. John McCain, who recently gave himself credit for suspending his campaign and shoring up House Republican support for the bill, boarded his plane without comment upon hearing of the bill's failure. And while Main Street's short-term cynicism about Bush's proposal may have been satisfied, such reservations on the part of the public was the result of a poor marketing job by an unpopular president, and ultimately Americans will hold accountable politicians who are seen as failing to rescue them from this crisis.</p> <p>America is waking up to the fact that the brand of laissez-faire capitalism that has guided America since the Reagan Revolution is a farce. Everyone was saying it, but no businessperson really believed in it when it came to their own family. As Paul Krugman recently remarked: \"Just as there are no atheists in foxholes, there are no libertarians in a financial crisis.\" Few people are willing to allow 35% unemployment and economic disaster to stand firm on the very principles that likely triggered this mess. It is true that over the long run, even if we did nothing America's markets would recover, and we would once again enjoy prosperity. But as John Maynard Keynes pointed out during our last great financial disaster: <a href=\"http://www.bartleby.com/66/8/32508.html\">\"In the long run, we're all dead.\"</a> <br> If you listen to the politicians and pundits, we are not supposed to blame the economic philosophy that has deregulated the markets and made financial industry lobbyists the prime architects of the very legislation designed to oversee their businesses. Instead, Americans are supposed to view this financial collapse as a disaster which was the fault of greedy people and irresponsible consumers. They used bad judgment. But where is the sense in this analysis? We are blaming consumers for trying to get easy credit, and financial institutions for trying to make lots of money. Is that not how the system was supposed to work? How can we second-guess willing sellers and willing buyers who purchased mortgage-backed securities at their market rate? Their risk, their reward \u2013 but apparently not their loss. The invisible hand seems all too obviously elitist. The rich are in trouble, so we act. The poor have been in trouble since the beginning of time, but that's just background noise on our walk to work. For the first time since 9/11, I've seen a president who has finally set aside his ideology and tried to govern. George Bush understands, at long last, that he cannot be remembered as being the 21st century's Herbert Hoover. Perhaps it is the sense of his legacy dawning upon him in the twilight hours of his presidency, but no one of sound mind is willing to allow financial institutions of the magnitude of AIG to collapse and trigger a <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2008/09/14/news/economy/greenspan/index.htm\">once-in-a-century </a> economic decline. <br> No one, apparently, but House Republicans, who killed a bill that Wall Street felt was necessary to cure this economic crisis, causing the market to plunge more than 400 points in 10 minutes. Fiscal conservatives tried and failed to make the central component of the bailout a combination of deregulation and tax cuts. While on paper giving financial institutions a temporary capital gains tax cut seems like a serious proposal, fiscal policy and regulatory changes are medium to long-term solutions that would do nothing to infuse cash into the system in the short term. This would have done very little to shore up confidence before the markets opened around the world this week, nor would it address the original sin of mortgage-backed securities.</p> <p>To address this problem, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/27/business/27plan.html?_r=1&amp;ref=business&amp;oref=slogin\">House Republicans pushed for an insurance programme</a> that could be used by the Treasury secretary, even though he has reportedly shown no interest in using such a tool. Such a proposal can hardly be characterised as anything other than a face-saving measure that does little to dampen the impact of a $700bn bail-out deal. How can fiscal conservatives explain to their constituents that in time of serious economic crisis, their philosophy simply is not a practical short-term solution? It seems that while Republicans can spin \"victory\" in Iraq, they cannot spin \"profit\" on Wall Street.<br> While no one can yet suggest America is on the verge of a second New Deal, paradigm shifts are often not obviously apparent at the time they occur. The second phase of the government's response to this crisis will involve regulatory overhaul. Congress will have to hold hearings on the cause of this disaster and they will no doubt find many instances of deregulation as the culprit. In 1982, Ronald Reagan pushed for the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garn_-_St_Germain_Depository_Institutions_Act\">Garn-St Germain Depository Institutions Act</a>, which in Title VIII specifically provided for the very adjustable-rate mortgages that have left consumers struggling to make their payments. They will find that in 1999 it was senator Phil Graham and a veto-proof Republican majority that demanded an overhaul of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 which separated commercial and investment banking. This might have contained this problem to one sector of the lending industry. Investigators will find that in 2000, Republicans and free market ideologues passed the Commodities Futures Modernisation Act which reduced transparency in the derivatives market. As Congress fulfils its oversight role, a picture will emerge of a comprehensive deregulation strategy which led to this crisis. <br> The end of the Reagan Revolution would not mean a sharp turn toward socialism, but a maturation of economic policy that understands the complexity and power of large financial institutions. Corporate executives should not have the right to risk the entire American economy \u2013 indeed the global economy \u2013 as part of their portfolio management, regardless of Ayn Rand's philosophical musings. While Republicans struggle to explain how the irresponsible decisions of executives and consumers are to blame, but their own policies which afforded them this opportunity are not, one wonders about the legacy of Reagan's economic policies. It seems that in a time of serious economic crisis, Americans will turn to Roosevelt rather than Reagan. Doing nothing simply isn't an option, and tax cuts and deregulation in a time of corporate excess makes little sense. It is only natural to wonder if this is more than a temporary shift in political discourse.</p>",
  "<p>The stunning failure of the Bush administration's massive financial rescue plan is prompting a day of reassessments and adjustments from the presidential candidates.</p> <p>The early consensus had John McCain suffering more than Barack Obama from the defeat of a bail-out they both cautiously backed. After all, it was McCain who swept back to Washington last week to help bring his party in line -- his aides today were claiming credit for Republican conversions that failed to materialise. </p> <p>McCain's camp took their time in responding to the shock developments in the House of Representatives, but the Politico <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/jonathanmartin/0908/McCain_follows_House_GOP_lead_blames_Dems.html?showall \">managed to procure a statement</a> from economic adviser Douglas Holtz-Eakin:</p> <blockquote> <p>From the minute John McCain suspended his campaign and arrived in Washington to address this crisis, he was attacked by the Democratic leadership: Senators Obama and Reid, Speaker Pelosi and others. Their partisan attacks were an effort to gain political advantage during a national economic crisis. By doing so, they put at risk the homes, livelihoods and savings of millions of American families. Barack Obama failed to lead, phoned it in, attacked John McCain, and refused to even say if he supported the final bill. Just before the vote, when the outcome was still in doubt, Speaker Pelosi gave a strongly worded partisan speech and poisoned the outcome. This bill failed because Barack Obama and the Democrats put politics ahead of country. </p> </blockquote> <p>The Republican's case to deflect blame to Obama is specious for a number of reasons. Democrats are already mocking McCain for his \"phoned it in\" jab, given that McCain himself chose to <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/jonathanmartin/0908/Why_does_McCain_keep_using_the_phone_it_in_metaphor.html?showall\">literally phone it in</a> on the weekend rather than travel the 6 miles from his Virginia condo to participate in Capitol negotiations.</p> <p>Moreover, more Democrats supported the bail-out bill than Republicans, making the \"politics ahead of country\" argument borderline impossible to make. And Obama and McCain both refused to say whether they supported the final bill, although both promised to cast a vote one way or another after the Senate debate -- which is still scheduled for Wednesday.</p> <p>Obama's response, by contrast, came at a public rally in Colorado, where he assured the audience that \"there are going to be some bumps and trials and tribulations and ups and down before we get this rescue package done\".</p> <blockquote> <p>It is important for the American public and for the markets to say calm because things are never smooth in congress and to understand that it will get done. That we are going to make sure an emergency package is put together because it is required for us to stabilize the markets and to make sure that when a small business-person wakes up tomorrow morning, he will be able to make payroll. ... I am confident we are going to get there but it's going to be sort of rocky. It's sort of like flying into Denver. You know you're going to land but it's not always fun going over those mountains.</p> </blockquote> <p>Which response was, as Americans like to say, more presidential? The polls should tell the tale in a few days.</p>",
  "<p>Sarah Palin was set to enter the confines of John McCain's ranch in Arizona today for three days of intensive preparations ahead of her showdown against Joe Biden in this week's vice-presidential television debate. Thursday night's match in St Louis, Missouri, will bring McCain's running mate her moment of greatest national exposure since the virtual unknown joined the Republican ticket for the White House.</p> <p>Though vice-presidential debates seldom influence an election, Palin's novelty raises the importance of the clash with her Democratic party counterpart. The debate offers a chance for her to redeem herself after a number of damaging press reports and disastrous TV interviews - or to self-destruct if she fails to hold her own against the far more experienced Biden.</p> <p>In a parting shot before she entered the seclusion of the ranch for the debate rehearsals, Palin told a rally in Columbus, Ohio, today that she was excited about the encounter. \"I'm looking forward to meeting Joe Biden. I've been hearing about him since second grade,\" she said.</p> <p>But the bravado belies the intense pressure on Palin to deliver a credible performance, and the efforts campaign aides have made to get her up to speed. A team of senior aides has been at her side for days, hunkering down in Philadelphia at the weekend and travelling with her today.</p> <p>At first glance, the debate might look like an unequal fight. Biden has been a ubiquitous figure in Washington for 36 years; Palin was virtually unknown outside her native Alaska until 33 days ago. A Wall Street Journal poll last week found that 49% of Americans thought Palin fit to be vice-president, against 64% for Biden.</p> <p>But Biden faces challenges as well in the first national debate between male and female candidates since Geraldine Ferraro ran for vice-president in 1984. He has been rehearsing against Jennifer Granholm, the governor of Michigan, to prepare for the gender dynamics.</p> <p>\"[Palin] has to show command of her material. She has to show preparedness to take on the presidency, and she has to show more intellectual gravitas than she has shown so far,\" said Alan Schroeder, a professor at North Eastern University who has written a book about 40 years of presidential debates. \"[Biden] has the problem of high expectations versus his opponent's low expectations.\"</p> <p>Though wildly popular with hardcore Republicans, Palin has become a butt of late-night comics for her insistence that Alaska's proximity to Russia gives her some insight into international affairs.</p> <p>The conservative commentator David Brooks called her candidacy \"embarrassing\" and Newsweek's Fareed Zakaria said her answers on the economy in a CBS interview last week were \"gibberish\".</p> <p>Today even Mitt Romney, a former Republican candidate for the White House, admitted that the campaign had mishandled Palin by keeping her from the media and trying to make her stick to scripted answers. \"Holding Sarah Palin to just three interviews and microscopically focusing on each I think has been a mistake,\" he told MSNBC. \"They'd be a lot wiser to let Sarah Palin be Sarah Palin. Let her talk to the media, talk to people.\"</p> <p>Palin's claim to be a crusader for reform has also been shaken by further investigation into her record in Alaska. The Associated Press reported today that Palin got exemption from zoning regulations to make it easier to sell her home in Wasilla. As a small town mayor, she made it a habit to accept gifts such as a facial, flowers and even fresh salmon from local merchants.</p> <p>Palin also faces questions about policy splits. Unlike McCain, she supports drilling in the Arctic wildlife refuge and only recently admitted a human role in global warming. She also opposes stem cell research, which McCain supports.</p> <p>Such differences could prove embarrassing to Biden as well. When he was running for the White House earlier this year, Biden said he did not think Obama was ready to be president.</p> <p>He has broken with the campaign on clean coal technology, and committed a number of gaffes. Earlier this month, he embarrassed Obama and himself by saying that Hillary Clinton would have made a better vice-presidential candidate.</p> <p>But perhaps his greatest challenge is to guard against being perceived as overbearing or condescending to a younger female candidate. This is especially true in the case of Palin, whose relative inexperience could make women viewers feel protective of her.</p> <p>Such factors have also come into play in debates with the most seasoned women politicians. Hillary Clinton, widely considered the Democrats' best debater, won her 2000 Senate debate when her opponent, Rick Lazio, came up to her and waved a sheaf of papers in her face. The invasion of Clinton's personal space outraged women viewers and made Lazio seem like a bully.</p> <p>George Bush Sr lost his debate against Ferraro in 1984 the moment he decided to give her a lecture about the difference between Lebanon and Iran.</p> <p>Ferraro, who had several years experience as a New York prosecutor and congresswoman on her resume, would have none of it. \"I almost resent, Vice-President Bush, your patronising attitude that you have to teach me about foreign policy,\" she shot back.</p> <p>The gaffe-prone Biden would also do well to remember that Bush dug himself even deeper into the hole the next day by bragging to a bunch of dockers that he had \"kicked a little ass\" in the debate.</p>",
  "<p>This is just really stunning and fascinating. </p> <p>The Republicans held a news conference. They said they couldn't come up with the votes because of a speech House Speaker Nancy Pelosi gave on the House floor this morning. It made them mad. Hurt their little feelings.</p> <p><a href=\"http://thepage.time.com/rep-pelosis-remarks-on-floor-ahead-of-house-bailout-vote/\">Here's the speech</a>. Tell me what in this speech is an attack on the House Republicans. To be sure, she's tough on Bush, for turning the Clinton surplus into a deficit, and she's tough on the conservative free-market philosophy. But the rhetoric was of a stripe that's employed on the floor of the House all the time.</p> <p>It's obviously just an attempt at spin. </p> <p>In the Democrats' press conference, held later, Barney Frank was hilarious. He was asked, as nearly as I could make it out, about reports that 12 or so Republicans were so offended by Pelosi's remarks that they changed from \"yes\" to \"no.\" Frank observed wryly that \"in one of the truly great coincidences in the history of numerology, the number of Republicans whose feelings were deeply hurt turned out to be exactly the number who could have passed bill.\" Touche.</p> <p>Democrats of course aren't blameless. They lost 95 of their members. <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2008/roll674.xml\">Here's</a> the roll call tally. The 95 looks to be an expected combination of members who lean left and thus opposed the deal from a left-populist perspective and many from moderate or even red districts where public sentiment surely ran strongly against the bailout.</p> <p>But the bottom line is that Democrats delivered enough votes. The Republican leadership didn't, just 65 out of 199. So what does this mean?</p> <p>The Dow is tanking, near 700 points down, maybe headed toward the biggest one-day loss in history. If things continue this way over the next few days\u2014and more importantly, if credit dries up and lending gets shut down and people start to feel that next week, or soon, when companies that normally borrow to meet payroll can't do so\u2014someone is going to take the blame. That someone will be the people who voted against.</p> <p>It's also bad news for John McCain, who was primed to take the credit for bringing the House Republicans into the fold assuming enough of them voted for passage. But now that that did not happen, his intervention last week looks like what it was\u2014foolish, and either irrelevant or counterproductive.</p> <p>And what if the market doesn't continue to plunge? Well, then the House GOP and McCain dodged a bullet. I suppose that if the sky doesn't fall in, the House GOP at least might be able to convert this into a political win. McCain, less so. He spent too much political capital on this to be able to walk away without a scrape.</p> <p>And oh yes, the president. As I said two weeks ago, lots of congressional Republicans were just dying for an opportunity to cast a vote against him. Nothing suits their purposes better, as they face their voters November 4, than to be able to brag about standing up to a president with a 28% approval rating.</p> <p>The political fallout will probably be greater in the congressional races than in the presidential race. I think. But this won't really be clear for a couple days.</p>",
  "<p>As a tense Washington worries about the future of the $700bn bailout plan, there is a real sigh of relief in news that Wachovia Bank, the nation's sixth largest and one that is chock full of lousy mortgages, <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2008/09/29/fdic-citi-to-buy-wachovias-banking-operations/\">has been taken over</a> by Citigroup under government auspices. That means the depositors are safe and it avoids putting more pressure on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the New Deal government institution created to protect small depositors should their banks go down. </p> <p>The FDIC has been under considerable strain in recent months and there has been a worry about its ability to survive. Of course, a collapse of the FDIC would be an unprecedented disaster for the general public, which would suddenly find itself unable to withdraw money from the bank. Since Wachovia is being taken over by Citigroup, it does not qualify as a failure and won't need FDIC insurance. What's more, if the FDIC faced serious collapse, then doubtless Congress would step in to shore it up. So, in all likelihood, the public is safe. Still, economists and journalists outside the Wall Street sphere are musing on the future of this venerable institution.</p> <p>In the <a href=\"www.nytimes.com/2008/09/29/opinion/29kristol.html?hp\">New York Times </a>on Monday conservative Bill Kristol said, \"There are serious economists, for example, who think we could be on the verge of a huge bank run. Congress may have to act to authorize the FDIC to provide far greater deposit insurance, and the secretary of the Treasury to protect money market funds. McCain can call for Congress to stand ready to pass such legislation. He can say more generally that in the tough times ahead, we'll need a tough president willing to make tough decisions.''<br> Created by Franklin Roosevelt during the Great Depression to persuade people it was safe to use banks, the FDIC has only $45.2bn in funds - nowhere near enough to cover depositors if a few more big banks, or 20 to 30 medium sized banks, should collapse.  As of the end of June, the FDIC was closely monitoring 117 \"troubled\" banks, up from 90 in the first quarter of 2008. That number is expected to grow, though it is small when measured against the nation's total of 8,400 banks. Still, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601213&amp;sid=amZxIbcjZISU&amp;refer=home\">Bloomberg</a> last week was quoting one expert saying that by the end of 2009, \"about 100 US banks with collective assets of more than $800 billion will fail.\" That prediction comes from Christopher Whalen, managing director of Institutional Risk Analytics in Torrance, California. Whale thinks the FDIC could suffer losses of $200bn, far above its reserves. Should the FDIC start to go under, Congress doubtless will rush to its aid. That would mean another massive bailout, this one perhaps on the very eve of the presidential election - or the inauguration of the unlucky man who wins it.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama is opening up a clear lead over John McCain after polls taken at the weekend showed the public overwhelmingly awarding Friday night's presidential debate to the Democratic candidate. The polls suggest that McCain gained no benefit from his impulsive actions in suspending his campaign and flying to Washington last week to help deal with the financial crisis. </p> <p>The opening gap could see an increase in more personal attacks on Obama. An early sign of that came today in a row over a dead soldier's bracelet: Obama faced claims that he has been wearing the bracelet, raised in Friday's debate, against the express wishes of the mother. </p> <p>With five weeks until the White House election, Obama appears to have broken the impasse that had seen the two in a deadheat in polls over the last month. A USA Today poll, published today, showed 45% of those surveyed felt Obama had done better in the debate than McCain, who registered only 34%. The public view is at odds with the media, who overwhelmingly judged it to be a draw. Other polls, including the Rasmussen tracking one, showed voters drifting towards Obama. A Rasmussen tracking poll puts Obama on 50% compared with McCain on 44%, which would give the Democratic candidate a landslide victory. </p> <p>McCain returned to the campaign trail today alongside his vice-presidential running mate, Sarah Palin, for the first time since suspending campaigning last Wednesday. In his speech in Ohio, McCain stuck to his main message of questioning whether Obama is fit to be president, saying the Democratic candidate had never voted other than the party line and had shown no sign of putting his country first. He directly accused him of lying in Friday's debate about tax plans. </p> <p>As the election draws closer, the two campaigns are firing back more and more claims and denials, also at increasing speed. Obama's team's denial on tax was out before McCain had completed his speech. </p> <p>If Obama maintains his lead, the Republicans are almost certain to step up personal attacks on the Democratic candidate. William Kristol, a right-wing commentator and editor of the Weekly Standard, in a column for the New York Times today offered suggestions on how McCain could win that included raising again his links with figures such as the controversial pastor, the Rev Jeremiah Wright. </p> <p>An early sign that the campaign could turn more personal was today's row over Obama's possession of the bracelet of a US soldier killed in Iraq. <br>Stories quickly appeared on the internet suggesting the mother was objecting to Obama exploiting her son's death. McCain, during the debate, said a soldier's mother gave him a bracelet. \"I've got a bracelet too, from Sergeant \u2014 from the mother of Sergeant Ryan David Jopek, given to me in Green Bay,\" Obama said. The mother, Tracy Jopek, told AP today she was \"ecstatic\" that Obama had mentioned her son during the debate. \"I don't understand how people can take that and turn it into some garbage on the internet,\" she said. She had asked Obama in February not to mention her son in speeches and debates but she felt it was appropriate on Friday in response to McCain. On Fox news today, Robert Gibbs, a senior Obama campaign adviser, denied the mother had asked Obama not to wear the bracelet. \"Let's get the facts right before we start making stuff up on the news,\" Gibbs said. A Fox presenter, Brian Kilmeade, replied testily: \"Don't say we're making stuff up!\u2026 Unbelievable\u2026 Goodbye.\"</p> <p>Both Obama and McCain have established what they refer to as truth squads, each offering quick rebuttals to what they see as incorrect claims. Both campaigns are expanding these squads, either adding more members or setting them up in new states.</p>",
  "<p>President McCain or President Obama? Who do the Tories support in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselections2008\">US election</a>? These intriguing questions attracted a full house to a breakfast time fringe meeting at the Tory conference in Birmingham today. And it soon became clear that, for many Tories, the answer is not necessarily the obvious one.</p> <p>Two years ago, John McCain jetted across the Atlantic to speak at the Tory conference in Bournemouth, David Cameron's first as leader. He was not at that time \u2013 even before the 2006 midterms \u2013 even close to being the Republican nominee to succeed George Bush. McCain came as an outsider, and he spoke ineffectively and too long, failing to connect with his audience. It seemed in some ways an odd gamble for the new look Tories to take. Still, the link between McCain and the Tories seemed sufficiently strong to suppose that, if McCain actually emerged in 2008, he would be the Tories' man.</p> <p>And yet when, a year ago at the Tory conference in Blackpool, with the US presidential election still only a subject for political anoraks, I buttonholed <a href=\"http://www.conservatives.com/People/Peers/Neville-Jones_Pauline.aspx\">Pauline Neville-Jones</a>, the former chair of the joint intelligence committee turned Tory peer and shadow cabinet member, and asked her who she wanted to win the 2008 election, her answer was immediate: Hillary Clinton. We'll definitely be able to work with her, said Neville-Jones. Not like McCain or the neoconservatives.</p> <p>A year on, and now there has of course been another massive turn of the wheel in American politics. Clinton's moment has been and gone. Now Barack Obama is the frontrunner and McCain has overturned the odds on the Republican side. He has nominated <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a> as his running mate. So where do the Tories stand amid all this change?</p> <p>Instinctively, I think most would prefer McCain to Obama. The reason is not complicated. Tribes of the right stick together. Yet Palin has shaken some of that resolve. Whenever her name was mentioned at the fringe meeting, there were intakes of breath and shakings of the head. Not many 2008 Tories, even the elderly ones, feel at ease with an anti-abortion, anti-climate change, pro-gun, religious conservative with zero experience of international politics. Here, as in America itself, the choice of Palin has led a lot of moderate conservatives to question McCain's judgment.</p> <p>Six weeks ago, I bumped into the shadow cabinet member <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/francismaude\">Francis Maude</a> at the Democratic convention in Denver. Are you heading to the Republican convention next week, I asked him. Not me, he responded. We are the insurgents and so are the Democrats. The Republicans and Labour are the incumbents. This is the conference for us to learn from.</p> <p>Maude was there again in Birmingham on Monday morning. This time he was more circumspect. I have a preference, he said, but not in public. But I have a prediction, he added \u2013 that John McCain will win in 2008, will serve a single term as president and that the 2012 contest will be between Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin. \"Book your seats now,\" said Maude.</p> <p>That was one of two good lines to come out of an otherwise inconclusive fringe. The other \u2013 and I record this merely for the benefit of posterity and the compilers of dictionaries of political quotes \u2013 came from Richard Nixon. No, Tricky Dicky wasn't back from the grave to be with us in Birmingham today. But his son-in-law Ed Cox, the very much alive chairman of the McCain campaign in New York, was. One of McCain's virtues, in Cox's view, was that he is a staunch free trader. \"My father-in-law always used to say 'Free trade is good policy but bad politics',\" Cox recalled. Head and heart always did have an uneasy relationship in Nixon's politics. And the same is true for the Tories when they look at the contest between McCain and Obama. I think a lot of them would be comfortable with McCain \u2013 but I also think they suspect Obama would be the right choice.</p>",
  "<p><br>A $700bn rescue plan for the sagging US financial market was defeated in Congress today, threatening to throw the already turbulent global financial markets into further disarray.</p> <p>The ambitious and risky bail-out fell short, 205-228, in the House of Representatives after an unprecedented push by both Democratic and Republican leaders to win their members' support for the deal.</p> <p>The Dow Jones industrial average plummeted by more than 5% as the 15-minute vote was stretched out to 40 minutes as Democratic leaders made a last-ditch attempt to change minds.</p> <p>But with the November election approaching, members of both parties were leery of giving the Bush administration sweeping new authority to save Wall Street firms. The fear of taking blame for an unsuccessful bail-out appeared to motivate many opponents.</p> <p>George Bush was \"very disappointed\" by the House failure today, spokesman Tony Fratto told reporters. The president will be meeting with advisers later to devise another plan for the bail-out, he added.</p> <p>\"We're all worried about losing our jobs,\" Paul Ryan, a conservative congressman and early critic of the rescue proposal, told colleagues before the vote. </p> <p>\"Most of us say, 'I want this thing to pass, but I want you to vote for it, not me'.\"</p> <p>Today's failure leaves Henry Paulson's strategy in tatters after 10 days of intense negotiations on a plan to allow the government to buy up risky mortgage-based assets. The US treasury secretary, must now find a new approach to curtailing the credit crisis.</p> <p>Not even a mind-boggling collapse in the stock market was enough to marshal support from the majority of the House. As the stunning vote unfolded, members shouted \"Order!\" in a plea to deal the financial rescue a death knell.</p> <p>After the vote, Republicans sought to pin blame on Democratic House speaker Nancy Pelosi, accusing her of taking an improperly partisan tone in her speech urging members to back the bail-out.</p> <p>Since Paulson first warned Congress of coming economic doom, the bail-out has torn traditional boundaries between Republicans and Democrats. Illustrating the topsy-turvy turn of events, the Democratic chairman of the financial services committee made an extraordinary appeal to liberals: obey the Bush administration.</p> <p>\"If we repudiate George Bush's secretary of the treasury and chairman of the Federal Reserve, if we repudiate them and say, 'Nah, calm down, we'll get over it,' I believe the consequences will be severe,\" Representative Barney Frank told his colleagues.</p> <p>Frank and other congressional leaders worked around the clock on the weekend to finalise a bail-out before markets opened today.</p> <p>Their rush could not stave off the latest day of financial shock, however. The FTSE 100 experienced a similar downturn, suffering a 5.3% drop that was the eighth largest in its history. The German DAX index fell 3.9% as the French CAC-40 index dropped 4.9%.</p> <p>Bush made another appeal to Congress today, urging legislators to approve the plan in order to avert further financial turmoil worldwide.</p> <p>\"This plan sends a strong signal to markets around the world that the United States is serious about restoring confidence and stability to our financial system,\" Bush said late yesterday. \"Without this rescue plan the costs to the American economy could be disastrous.\"</p> <p>The new bail-out deal was reached after Paulson allowed major changes aimed at ensuring the government could recoup its massive investment in the market.</p> <p>But the addition of a financial oversight board, limits on executive pay, and the disbursement of the $700bn in several instalments was not enough to win over conservative Republicans. They remained bitterly critical of the bail-out, describing it as a first step to socialising the capitalist economy.</p> <p>\"I believe that this plan is fraught with unintended consequences \u2026 and could permanently and fundamentally change the role of government in the American free enterprise system,\" Jeb Hensarling, the Republican congressman who led bail-out foes on the right, said in a statement.</p> <p>Dozens of liberals also opposed the rescue plan as lacking needed help for homeowners facing foreclosure and bankruptcy.</p> <p>The House could return to reconsider the bail-out as soon as tomorrow. The earliest it could receive a vote in the Senate is Wednesday, due to a recess for the Jewish New Year.</p> <p>Both John McCain and Barack Obama have released statements supporting the bail-out deal and both candidates have vowed to leave the campaign trail to cast a vote on the bail-out.</p>",
  "<p>It appears that the bailout measure just lost in the House of Reps, 226-207. The vote is being held open over normal time, which is dirty pool whether Republicans do it (as they did on the big Medicare vote of 2003) or whether Democrats do it (today). The vote looks like this: Dems for 141; Dems against, 95. Reps for, 66; Reps against, 132.</p> <p>During the vote, the Dow went as low as -700. It was pretty gripping to watch the no votes tally up on the left side of the screen while on the right side the DJIA went -455, -476, -512, -549...and so on down to, I think, 701. As I write, with the vote seemingly ended, the day's losses are quasi-stable at around -450, somewhere in there.</p> <p>The big surprise here? Clearly, the 95 Democratic no votes. How does the Dem leadership bring this to the floor without being sure they have the votes? Absolutely staggering. Apparently many Dems from marginal districts saw that a large number of Reps were voting against and thought, hey, if this might go down, why should I stick my neck out?</p> <p>As for presidential politics, I can't sort it out yet. Maybe a gift for McCain insofar as it would appear that having failed in the House, this measure won't even go to the Senate for a vote. I guess that's a gift for both of them. It sure is devastating for Bush.</p> <p>I think the thing to do at this point is go to the craps table (my new name for the gym) and clear my head and report back to you later.<br></p>",
  "<p>The emerging consensus among right-wing commentators is that John McCain has made a terrible mistake in connection with Sarah Palin. No, not <em>that</em> terrible mistake! The terrible mistake in question is the campaign's decision to limit her exposure to a handful of interviews with mainstream outlets, where biased liberal journalists ask her 'gotcha' questions and then the rest of the media pick forensically over her responses. The solution: free Sarah Palin to be herself, to speak to conservative talk-radio outlets, and not to worry about tricky \"facts\" and suchlike. <a href=\"http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=OTUzNTM3MDk0MmI3ZWM1N2ZkZDAwZTFmMjA5Nzk3MWM=\" \" klo\">Here's</a> Kathryn Jean Lopez at the National Review:</p> <p>\"My guess \u2014 based on nothing but hope for a change \u2014 is that Sarah Palin just needs some freedom. I don't know who is holding her back but if John McCain wants to win this thing it had better not be him and his staff. When I watch these interviews, I see a woman who looks like she's stayed up all night studying and is trying to remember the jurisprudential chronology of privacy vis-a-vis reproduction, the war on terror, and public figures (add 12 more things, described in the most complicated way possible, to the list to be more accurate).\"</p> <p>Similar views are expressed by the <a href=\"http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZTQ0MmU5ZmIyNjhkMTY1NjY3ZjZkMjk5ZGY5MmFjNTE=\">reliably insane Mark Steyn</a>, and also <a href=\"http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NTQ1MDEzYmM1MWQ2NTg4MTYwN2Q1NTVkMDE0MjU2Njk=\">Byron York</a>. And now <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/29/opinion/29kristol.html?_r=1&amp;hp=&amp;pagewanted=print&amp;oref=slogin\">here's</a> the influential conservative New York Times columnist Bill Kristol, this morning:</p> <p>\"I'm told McCain recently expressed unhappiness with his staff's handling of Palin. On Sunday he dispatched his top aides Steve Schmidt and Rick Davis to join Palin in Philadelphia. They're supposed to liberate Palin to go on the offensive as a combative conservative in the vice-presidential debate on Thursday.\"</p> <p>Now, as <a href=\"http://www.reason.com/blog/show/129102.html\">Hit and Run notes</a>, Palin's past debating performances in Alaska don't really suggest that she is a combative conservative at all: \"She's an affable, aw-shucks conservative.\" But not to worry! <a href=\"http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/09/cbs_to_air_more_footage_of_cou.php\">Several sources</a> are <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/28/AR2008092802587_3.html?hpid=\" topnews\" \">reporting</a> that CBS has more embarrassing interview responses by Palin which it plans to air in the run-up to Thursday's debate, thereby lowering expectations so far that her victory is surely inevitable, no matter how much fancy book-learnin' Joe Biden exhibits.</p>",
  "<p>As the professional pundits and spinmeisters took to the airwaves following Friday's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/27/uselections2008.barackobama1\">debate between Barack Obama and John McCain</a>, one figure was conspicuously absent: Sarah Palin.</p> <p>\"We've been getting some emails from viewers out there wondering why we spent some time interviewing Joe Biden, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee and not Sarah Palin, the Republican vice-presidential nominee,\" <a href=\"http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_stump/archive/2008/09/26/sarah-palin-mia.aspx\">said Wolf Blitzer</a> on CNN. \"We would have loved to interview - we'd still love to interview Sarah Palin. Unfortunately we asked, we didn't get that interview. ... We're hoping that Sarah Palin will join us at some point down the road.\"</p> <p>\"Don't hold your breath on that one,\" Blitzer's colleague Anderson Cooper replied pithily.</p> <p>We'll hear from Palin on Thursday night when she debates Biden in St Louis, Missouri, but any appearance before then is highly unlikely. Indeed, Palin's been ducking the media for a month now. She has <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0908/13208.html\">not held a single press conference</a> since her nomination and has granted just three television interviews. Even <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0908/13791.html\">access to Palin's grip-and-grin photo-ops</a> has been curtailed. Palin <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0908/13910.html\">broke her silence</a> briefly on Thursday, answering a grand total of four questions while touring September 11-related sites in New York, but the media blackout resumed on Friday. Taking a page out of <a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/04/clinton-takes-a.html\">Hillary Clinton's campaign playbook</a>, she <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/jonathanmartin/0908/Where_was_Sarah_Palin_last_night_you_ask.html?showall\">watched the debate in an Irish pub</a> in Philadelphia.</p> <p>The lack of access to Palin has naturally frustrated journalists. Last week, CNN's Campbell Brown called on the McCain campaign to <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/24/campbell.brown.palin/index.html\">\"Free Sarah Palin\"</a>. But while drawing the media's ire, the strategy (or i<a href=\"http://miamiherald.typepad.com/nakedpolitics/2008/09/mccain-whats-di.html\">s it a tactic</a>?) may work with voters.</p> <p>For Obama and McCain, the key to winning Friday's debate was not simply scoring points, but also avoiding major mistakes. The consensus among pundits seems to be that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/sep/27/uselections2008.barackobama1\">the debate was a draw</a> that Obama, in some ways the underdog on foreign policy, won only by default. Both candidates appeared substantive. Neither landed a knockout punch or committed any game-changing gaffes. </p> <p>Given the close contest, ceding the crucial, opinion-shaping post-debate airtime to Biden might have been a mistake. But consider this: Had Palin gone on TV following the debate and failed to answer basic questions, as she did in her interviews with ABC's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/sep/12/sarahpalin.uselections2008\">Charlie Gibson</a> and CBS's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/sep/25/johnmccain.sarahpalin\">Katie Couric</a>, then she \u2013 not McCain \u2013 would have been the story of the night. It would have been disastrous.</p> <p>Instead, viewers not familiar with Palin's stonewalling of the press might assume that she was a victim of the <a href=\"http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003853490\">supposed liberal media bias</a> the McCain campaign has been complaining about. Hence Blitzer's need to clarify why she wasn't on the air.</p> <p>Palin's silence may also help lower expectations for her debate with Biden this week. Remember, the initial reaction to her nomination was: Sarah Palin who? Then she surprised everyone by rocking the house at the Republican National Convention. The critics were silenced, at least for a time. Now, after her rocky interviews with Gibson and Couric, people are wondering again whether Palin actually knows her stuff, and whether she can think on her feet. Her reluctance to appear in public has fuelled suspicions that she can't. If she performs well against Biden on Thursday she could lay those suspicions to rest.</p>",
  "<p>During the last presidential election I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/oct/04/uselections2004.usa\">drove from John Kerry's home in Boston to Bush's childhood home in Midland</a>, Texas over a month, stopping en route to report from the swing states. It was a fascinating, beautiful journey that brought me in contact with a broad range of Americana, from an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/oct/09/uselections2004.usa\">evangelical family in rural Pennsylvania</a> who had lost their son in the Iraq war to a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/oct/23/uselections2004.gayrights\">drag queen in small town Missouri</a> who had campaigned against the ban on gay marriage.</p> <p>I returned the day after the election to my home in Brooklyn where crestfallen friends and neighbours struggled to comprehend Bush's narrow victory. They questioned me as though I was an anthropologist who had been roaming around the hinterland questioning the natives. \"What were they thinking?\" \"How could they do this?\" \"What is wrong with them?\"</p> <p>Their questions seemed to refer to a foreign country with which they were not only unfamiliar, but which in many ways seemed to frighten them. Over the next few days conservative commentators crowed about the coastal elites who were out of touch in mainstream America, painting the result as payback for their condescension.</p> <p>But for all their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/20/september11.usa\">manipulative claims of victimhood</a> (most of these commentators were themselves coastal elitists) they did seem to have a point. For all the ways in which New York, Los Angeles or San Fransisco are cosmopolitan, the political conversations that take place there are far less diverse and varied than elsewhere in the country. They refer to the rest of the country as the fly-over states - the inconvenient electoral truth in between New York and Los Angeles - deriding them for their obsession with guns, god and gays. </p> <p>In my neighbourhood posters of Obama hang in estate agents, Laundromats, restaurants and corner stores, not to mention on T-shirts. I have yet to see a McCain sign or a bumper sticker anywhere. Were it not for the media you wouldn't even know he was standing. And like just about every other foreign newspaper here, all Guardian correspondents are based on the coasts, reporting on a political climate which we endeavour to understand from afar.</p> <p>So rather than drive through the country and drop in on middle America this time I thought I would stick around in a town where the campaign would be decided rather than just discussed and let the election came to me. So for the next few weeks I'll be in <a href=\"http://www.roanokeva.gov\">Roanoke, Virginia</a> a former railroad town of just under 100,000 that nestles in a valley between the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Appalachians. I'll be talking to everyone I can about almost anything they want to talk about - trying to get a sense of how the issues here relate to what is going on nationally and vice versa.</p> <p>Why Roanoke? Well I was looking for a relatively small town in a swing state which, given the historic nature of Barack Obama's candidacy, has a sizeable African-American population. Preferably it would be a place where the vote between Bush and Kerry were close and where both Obama and John McCain had struggled in the primaries. A town, in other words, where both sides <a href=\"http://www.roanoke.com/news/roanoke/wb/174214\">had work to do</a> if they were to shore up their base, and there was everything to play for. </p> <p>There were a few other candidates in Ohio, Florida and Missouri. But, as a state which has not been seriously contested for more than 40 years, Virginia tells us something specifically interesting about this election in a way the others do not. If John McCain is to win the state he must make rally his support in this south-west region to compensate for his losses elsewhere.</p> <p>In some ways Roanoke could be anywhere. The poverty is slightly higher and the wages slightly lower than the national average. It voted narrowly for John Kerry in 2004 and Barack Obama in the priamaries and roundly rejected John McCain in favour of the conservative governor-cum-preacher, Mike Huckabee. In the local newspaper's poll about who won the Friday's debate, Obama won 58% to McCain's 31% - roughly in keeping with national polls. On Friday the credit crunch hit home when the local insurance agency, <a href=\"http://www.roanoke.com/business/wb/178368\">Shenandoah Life had its ratings downgraded</a> because of its exposure to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.</p> <p>But its mixture of the Southern and the Appalachian also makes it quite distinct. This is bluegrass country. The owner of the guitar store, the Fret Mill Music Company, says the economic slowdown has not yet started biting because everybody in the area has a guitar - it sounded almost compulsory. As the largest town in the state for more than 100 miles in any direction it is big enough to have its own airport. But its small enough that a large portion of the people catching planes seem to know each other and the security guards quite well.</p> <p>The people seem friendly and a little eccentric. I hope those impressions hold. It'll be a long few weeks if they don't.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Contact Gary Younge at <a href=\"mailto:g.younge@theguardian.com\">g.younge@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Predictably, some commenters have jumped on me for my criticism of McCain's craps habit. It's how he relaxes. What business is it of mine? And aren't I just an apologist for Obama, an inveterate poker player?</p> <p>Actually, as I said, I don't like poker either, so neither habit particularly recommends either man to me. But let's go look at the record. <a href=\"http://www.suntimes.com/news/politics/obama/729330,obamapoker092407.stng\">Here's</a> an old Chicago Sun-Times piece on Obama's style of poker play:</p> <blockquote> <p>Obama was a regular at the low-stakes games sometimes stud poker, sometimes draw designed to break up the tedium of long legislative sessions...</p> <p>...By his poker buddies' accounts, Obama is careful and focused. He's not easily distracted and doesn't give away his intentions unless it's to his advantage. He's not prone to taking risky chances, preferring to play it safe. But he's also serious and competitive: When he plays, he plays to win....</p> <p>...Obama studied the odds carefully, friends say. If he had strong cards, he'd play. If he didn't, he would fold rather than bet good money on the chance the right card would show up when he needed it.</p> <p>That reputation meant that he often succeeded when he decided to bluff.</p> <p>\"When Barack stayed in, you pretty much figured he's got a good hand,\" said Larry Walsh, a former senator.</p> <p>More than one lawmaker teased Obama about his careful style of play.</p> <p>\"I always used to kid him that the only fiscally conservative bone in his body I ever saw was at the poker table with his own money,\" said state Sen. Bill Brady, a Republican from the central Illinois city of Bloomington. \"I said if he would be half as conservative with taxpayer dollars, the state would be a lot better off.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>OK. As I said I'm a non-gambler and even sort of an anti-gambler, I guess, but that doesn't strike me as a problematic way to gamble. McCain has been known to spend 14 hours a time at the tables. He plays much higher stakes, and by some of his supporters' admissions he pushes the envelope of the respectable. From a Time magazine report:</p> <blockquote> <p>Only recently have McCain's aides urged him to pull back from the pastime. In the heat of the G.O.P. primary fight last spring, he announced on a visit to the Vegas Strip that he was going to the casino floor. When his aides stopped him, fearing a public relations disaster, McCain suggested that they ask the casino to take a craps table to a private room, a high-roller privilege McCain had indulged in before. His aides, with alarm bells ringing, refused again, according to two accounts of the discussion.</p> <p>\"He clearly knows that this is on the borderline of what is acceptable for him to be doing,\" says a Republican who has watched McCain play. \"And he just sort of revels in it.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>As the Time piece goes on to say, one can clearly see both of these approaches at work in their campaigns. Obama is cautious and methodical. McCain rolls the dice (Palin, his stunt last week). So if they're that way at the tables and that way in their campaigns, isn't it probably reasonable to think they might reflect those habits as president? Of course it is.</p> <p>I relax by playing golf and tennis, playing the guitar, drinking wine and sometimes beer but not to excess except in rare cases any morewatching football, and watching some bad American TV. Pretty boring, I know. Most people relax in equally boring ways. </p> <p>But all forms of relaxation are not equal. If a candidate announced, for example, that he relaxed by clubbing baby seals or watching his vast collection of taped Stalin speeches, I think we'd all agree that those were unusual pursuits and didn't really recommend him for office. Where on that scale does risking thousands of dollars of his spouse's money on a game of pure chance rest? </p> <p>It's in the eye of the beholder of course. But I didn't say that doing that made McCain the moral equivalent of Hitler. I said that that trait wasn't the most reassuring trait in a prospective president. Especially given that his campaign has been replete with such weird risk-taking, I have trouble seeing why that statement should bother anyone, unless they're already bothered by the fact that their candidate is starting to tank.<br></p>",
  "<p>It's not clear why anyone should bother listening to Ehud Olmert any more: Israel's now caretaker prime minister resigned earlier this month after losing his long battle against corruption allegations. He will shortly be replaced by Tzipi Livni, who will have to lead their Kadima party in a bruising fight against the Likud's Bibi Netanyahu in the next general election. There's no point pretending that this discredited politician will be sorely missed.</p> <p>But Olmert's valedictory <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/29/israelandthepalestinians.syria\">Jewish New Year message</a> is worth listening to as a bald, if belated, re-statement of the only way to resolve the world's most intractable conflict \u2013 even if he failed to achieve it. \"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, the meaning of which is that in practice we will withdraw from almost all the territories, if not all the territories,\" he told the mass-circulation Yediot Aharonot for its eve-of-holiday edition. \"We will leave a percentage of these territories in our hands but will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage because without that there will be no peace.\" Any land swaps \u2013 mooted in the dying days of the Clinton administration \u2013 would have to be on a 1:1 basis. And the Gaza Strip and the West Bank would have to be linked to create contiguous territory for the Palestinian state.</p> <p>Strikingly, Olmert conceded that Israel's withdrawal would have to include parts of East Jerusalem, puncturing the myth that the city can remain Israel's \"eternal and undivided capital\" \u2013 always an absurd fantasy for anyone who has looked at it with their eyes open. And coming from a former mayor who pursued openly discriminatory policies against Palestinians, and who began his political career in the far-right Herut party, that was no small admission.<br>Olmert was similarly blunt on the Syrian front, calling for the return of the Golan Heights, captured by Israel from Syria in the 1967 war and annexed in 1981. Taken Israel's hope that Bashar al-Assad can somehow be detatched from his odd-man out alliance with Iran \u2013 and drop its support for Hizbullah in Lebanon and Hamas in Palestine (a very tall order) \u2013 that is no more than than sober realism.</p> <p>His interviewers, Nahum Barnea and Shimon Schiffer, are two of Israel's best political journalists, and they wisely pointed out that Olmert is now in \"legacy\" territory, no longer responsible for any of the policies he advocates \u2013 and perhaps even considering a future comeback. Fair comment. So was the observation from the veteran dove, Yosi Beilin, who complained that Olmert's record included the disastrous war 2006 in Lebanon and building a coalition with rightwingers \"to stifle any peace process\". Aluf Benn, the perceptive Ha'aretz commentator, <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1025457.html\">called Olmert's epiphany</a> \"too little, too late\". </p> <p>Still, it's rare to hear a politician anywhere speak so candidly \u2013 insisting that he was not trying to justify retroactively what he had done for 35 years. \"For a large portion of these years, I was unwilling to look at reality in all its depth,\" he confessed.</p> <p>Olmert's prescription for peace may be no more than stating the obvious \u2013 but it is not yet obvious to enough Israelis or those who support them and claim to have their best interests at heart. Many now believe the conflict simply cannot be resolved and can only be managed by maintaining military superiority. An alarming new theme is that since Israel now faces an existential threat from a nuclear Iran (led by a president who denies the Holocaust,) the Palestinians, safely locked into Gaza or stuck behind the West Bank wall/fence/barrier, are irrelevant. Palestinian divisions \u2013 reflected in the failures of the secular nationalists of the PLO and the rise of Hamas \u2013 have given new life to the old saw that there is no \"partner\" for peace (ignoring Israel's own role in failing to deliver a viable settlement).<br>It has become fashionable to argue, as the Palestinian writer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/25/middleeast\">Ghada Karmi did here recently</a>, that the two-state solution is dead and that only one unitary state can end the conflict \u2013 though how that is to be achieved remains tantalisingly unclear. </p> <p>There are, it is true, plenty of reasons for profound pessimism: the facts of occupation on the ground established by Israel over 40 years, multiplying since the 1993 Oslo accords with the PLO and again since last November's Annapolis summit, seem to have buried that idea under the tarmac of bypass roads and the concrete of Jewish settlements, tunnels and walls. It is easy to succumb to despair. It would still be wrong to do so.</p> <p>The answer to the problems of Israelis and Palestinians remains the same today as it was 20 years ago in the wake of the first intifada: two independent states based on the immutable bedrock of history, geography and justice \u2013 dividing one small country equitably between the two peoples who are now doomed to inhabit it. Olmert is absolutely right about that \u2013 even if his own convictions were too weak to guide him when he could still have made a difference.</p>",

After he flew back to Washington \"to help seal a deal,\" and after he allegedly spent Saturday and Sunday working the phones trying to help iron out a compromise and get the House Republicans on board, it's kind of hard to see how he can just punt.</p> <p>An Obama spokeswoman also inserted plenty of wiggle room into her official statement. \"We are closely monitoring the vote schedule,\" Obama spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. \"Senator Obama has always said that when the vote is close and his vote is needed he will be there.\" This vote, everyone knows, will not in all likelihood be close in the Senate, so the statement smells like he's setting it up to skip the vote.</p> <p>Obama should vote. He's not a player of cutesy games, and he shouldn't start now. He should just do what he thinks is right and responsible and, if there's a populist hit to be taken, take it. His response to such criticism seems obvious: Even John McCain said doing nothing \"is simply not an acceptable option,\" which McCain indeed said on TV Sunday, and I'm here in Washington casting my vote and taking whatever lumps I might take because that's what leadership is, and reviewing this bailout is the first thing I'll do as president.</p> <p>I remember kind of wondering last Thursday, after the White House negotiations ended at an impasse, why McCain didn't issue a statement hinting strongly that he was inclined to vote against it. <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/26/campaign.wrap/\">What he actually said</a> was fairly weak and noncommittal in either direction:</p> <blockquote> <p> McCain told ABC News on Thursday night that Republicans \"have legit concerns. Some of those have already been satisfied, such as accountability and oversight board and CEO executive pay. Members are aware of the crisis situation that we are in.\"</p> <p>However, McCain said, \"They do have concerns, which I think when you're talking about $700 billion to a trillion dollars, that need to be addressed.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>That's pretty waffly. I think that, if McCain really wanted to ride the right-populist stallion and vote against this thing, that was the key moment. A stronger statement then would've emboldened House Republicans to stand their ground. So I think he misplayed it and now almost has to vote yes.</p> <p>But with McCain, you never know! <br></p>",

(Andrew Sullivan, who first started putting this about, is <a href=\"http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/09/horseshit.html\">having second thoughts</a>. The Nation has <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/blogs/campaignmatters/365365\">more</a>.) If what McCain really said was \"of course not,\" though, it still doesn't really make sense: of course he wouldn't meet with Zapatero? Of course he didn't mean he <em>wouldn't</em> meet with Zapatero? Neither of these mesh with the <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/09/18/mccain_slights_spanish_prime_m.html\">official campaign position</a>, which is that the question is undecided. So perhaps we must simply conclude that John McCain occasionally mutters confusing things in public. Meanwhile, I urge anyone with a high tolerance for bad language to watch <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqmGzw-s2G8\">this absolutely fantastic YouTube video</a>, which uses super-sensitive microphones (and, just possibly, the audio track from <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093058/\">Full Metal Jacket</a>) to reveal the full and shocking extent of McCain's cursing during that debate.</p>",
  "<p>Western observers today said parliamentary elections in Belarus over the weekend were seriously flawed after the opposition failed to win a single seat.</p> <p>In a damning assessment, election observers said Sunday's poll to elect a new lower house of parliament had fallen well short of international democratic standards, despite a few \"minor improvements\".</p> <p>Their withering verdict came after Belarus's president, Alexander Lukashenko, promised the poll would be free and fair, saying he hoped it would lead to improved ties with the west, especially the European Union.</p> <p>There now seems little prospect that the EU will review sanctions against Belarus, which were imposed in 2006 after the EU and US said Lukashenko had rigged his re-election.</p> <p>This afternoon the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Europe's main monitoring body, said the vote count had been plagued by problems of cheating.</p> <p>\"The count was assessed as bad or very bad in 48% of polling stations visited. Where access was possible, several cases of deliberate falsification of results were observed,\" the OSCE said.</p> <p>Access to polling stations had been prevented in 35% of cases, it added, with promises to ensure transparency \"not implemented\".</p> <p>\"Substantial improvements are required if Belarus is to conduct a genuinely democratic election,\" Anne-Marie Lizin, a senior OSCE monitor, said.</p> <p>The former Soviet republic's election commission this morning confirmed that the opposition had failed to win a single seat in the new house of representatives, with pro-government candidates sweeping the board.<br>Opposition leaders claimed the poll had been rigged. They immediately called on the west not to recognise its validity.</p> <p>\"There was no election in Belarus. It was an electoral farce,\" Anatoly Lebdko, leader of the opposition United Civil party, told the Associated Press. He added: \"We call on the EU and US not to recognise the results of this election.\"</p> <p>The democratic opposition failed to win any of the 110 parliamentary seats up for grabs, despite fielding 70 candidates.</p> <p>On Sunday, Lukasenko insisted the elections would be more transparent than previous polls, and would usher in a new era of improved relations with the west. </p> <p>\"If the election goes smoothly, the west will recognise Belarus,\" he said. Referring to the US secretary of state, Condeleeza Rice, who in 2005 branded him Europe's last dictator, he added: \"Dictator, last dictator: fine. Let it be so.\"</p> <p>Today, Belarus's central election commission head, Lidia Yermoshina, said the poll had been fair. Explaining Lukashenko's landslide victory, she said: \"The voter is afraid of losing what he has.\"</p> <p>As soon as polls closed last night, however, about 500 opposition supporters turned out on the central square of the capital, Minsk, to protest against the vote. Many waved European Union flags.</p> <p>\"We are tired of living in fear. We are tired of repression,\" said Natalya Kurilovich, 34. \"I'm tired of Lukashenko stealing votes. I want a European future for my children.\" </p> <p>A couple of hundred young protesters marched to the headquarters of the KGB, the country's secret police, and chanted \"shame\" outside the building before moving on and eventually returning to the main square.</p> <p>The EU has denounced previous elections in Belarus as illegitimate. In 2006 the US and EU imposed travel bans on Lukashenko and 40 of his senior officials, after accusing him of fraudulently arranging his re-election.</p> <p>Recently, however, the west has shown interest in improving ties with Belarus. This has come as relations with Moscow have nose-dived following last month's war in Georgia and amid a row over Russia's claim to \"privileged interest\" in former Soviet states.</p> <p>British officials say they are watching yesterday's poll closely. The EU is now prepared to review current sanctions against Minsk if there are \"demonstrable\" improvements in the regime's democratic and human rights record, they suggest.</p> <p>Last night, however, opposition spokesmen in Belarus said the poll had already been rigged. The government had used \"administrative resources\" to force students and others to take part in early voting and opposition monitors had been banned from polling stations, they said.</p> <p>\"Again there are no democratic elections in Belarus. The house of representatives can't be considered democratic since members will be nominated by Lukashenko's finger,\" Vintsuk Vechorka, the co-chairman of Belarus' main opposition group, the United Democratic Forces, said.</p> <p>He told the Guardian: \"Lukashenko doesn't want to improve elections. He wants to improve his image in the eyes of the west. He's trying to survive between Putin's KGB Russia and the west. He wants better relations with the west so he can trade with Putin.\"</p>",

Defending Livingstone's record, Ross stressed the disorder of Johnson's first four months and blamed next year's fare rises on the abandonment of the proposed gas guzzler C-charge and the Venezuela oil deal. A good \u00a365 million flushed away there, he says. </p> <p>Does he have a point? Whatever the size of the sum involved, there's surely an effect on the income stream.

Mmm, savour that lawyerly language. The key to it, he adds, was Johnson's deciding to \"take more day-to-day decisions himself.\" What he doesn't say is that Parker pissed a load of people off. (I could name names, you know...) </p> <p>He also outlined an autumn timetable, saying the youth crime prevention strategy is coming \"shortly\" followed by an initiative on gangs in November.

  "<p>There are many excellent analysts and opinion purveyors outside of New York and Washington.

  "<p>Almost every major auto manufacturer has now announced <a href=\"http://climateprogress.org/2008/09/22/chrysler-mazda-hyundai-and-nissan-announce-plug-ins-honda-stands-alone-against-phevs/\">plans to offer a plug-in hybrid vehicle</a> that can run on electricity for 20-40 miles before switching to gasoline. Since half of American cars travel under 25 miles a day, plug-ins allow people to do most of their driving on electricity, but still have a car for long-distance trips that can be easily and quickly refuelled with gasoline.</p> <p>The most highly anticipated of all the plug-ins is the <a href=\"http://climateprogress.org/2008/09/18/all-things-chevy-volt-including-the-house-tax-credit-for-plug-ins/\">Chevy Volt</a>, whose new design was recently rolled out by GM. It will be offered to the public by the end of 2010, and, soon after that, <a href=\"http://climateprogress.org/2007/09/01/gm-may-make-60000-plug-in-hybrids-in-2010/\">GM expects to be selling 60,000 a year</a>.</p> <p>One key advantage of electricity as an alternative fuel is that it is much, <a href=\"http://blogs.cars.com/kickingtires/2008/09/chevy-volt-pict.html\">much cheaper per mile than gasoline</a> at current prices. GM says it will cost $0.02 per mile to drive the Volt less than 40 miles per day, versus $0.12 per mile for gasoline at a price of $3.60. If gas prices continue to rise over the next decade, as many think, the fuel savings from plug-ins will only grow.</p> <p>Another advantage is that electricity can come from pollution-free sources that do not contribute to global warming. There simply is no other alternative fuel that offers a more affordable and practical path to sharply reducing the transportation sector's greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>That said, the lithium-ion batteries required for plug-ins have never been used for this application before. As one battery expert told me: \"There are only pilot production of various Li-Ion batteries\" around the world. An alternative fuel vehicle expert told me that GM has \"already sunk at least $1bn into the Volt and cannot reasonably expect a profit from a $45,000 new car in an economy which is imploding. The actual cost of the vehicle may be higher.\"</p> <p>So to succeed, plug-ins like the Volt will require several years of sustained government support. But that should not be a surprise. No country in the world has achieved significant market penetration of an alternative-fuel vehicle without major government incentives and mandates.</p> <p>Yet while Barack Obama strongly believes in such incentives and mandates, John McCain has a quarter-century record in Congress strongly opposing them. Indeed, he has voted with oil-patch senator James Inhofe and against clean energy and alternative fuels a remarkable <a href=\"http://climateprogress.org/2008/09/20/the-greenwasher-from-arizona-has-a-record-as-dirty-as-the-denier-from-oklahoma/\">42 out of 44 times since the mid-1990s</a>, not even counting the last eight consecutive votes on renewable energy incentives that he didn't bother to show up for.</p> <p>His campaign's big new idea for pushing plug-ins? He proposed <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/06/23/campaign.wrap/\">a $300m government prize</a> to whoever develops a car battery that far surpasses current batteries. But every energy and car company on the planet already knows they'll get rich by improving batteries. Indeed, the world is probably spending $1bn a year in this quest. This $300m prize is a pointless gimmick.</p> <p>Obama has committed to putting one million plug-ins on the road by 2015. He has proposed a $7,000 tax credit for the purchase of such vehicles. Finally, to help jump-start a plug-in market, Obama has committed that \"half of all cars purchased by the federal government will be plug-in hybrids or all-electric by 2012.\"</p> <p>If this country doesn't strongly embrace plug-ins, Europe may well become the leader. After all, gas prices are considerably higher in Europe, which means plug-ins will provide consumers there far larger fuel cost savings. Also, Europeans drive about half as much as Americans, so they may be able to avoid gas consumption almost entirely with a well-designed plug-in, perhaps one with a smaller all-electric range.</p> <p>Indeed, GM has made a mistake by giving the Volt a 40-mile all-electric range. The batteries are by far the most expensive thing in plug-ins. Also, the batteries add weight and take up considerable trunk space. So a smart designer will put in the fewest batteries needed to capture the most consumer benefit.</p> <p>The vast majority of people commute much less than 40 miles a day. This is true in US and even more so in other countries. In addition, as plug-ins become popular, we will very quickly see electric outlets in parking garages, malls and the like, so people will be able to charge at home and then again at work or when shopping.</p> <p>So I think a plug-in that goes closer to 20 miles all-electric before reverting to a gasoline hybrid makes much more sense, especially for initial market introduction where the cost of the vehicle still reflects the use of expensive batteries that have not come down in cost. Ultimately, economies of scale and improvements in manufacturing and technology will make the batteries and the whole electric drivetrain more affordable.</p> <p>The twin problems of global warming and limited oil resources make plug-ins inevitable. The only question is which companies and which countries become the leaders. That will be determined in part by the marketplace and in part by the US election.</p>",
  "<p>Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, has won a referendum on a new constitution that will implement leftist reforms, including increased state control over monetary and oil policy.</p> <p>Preliminary results showed 65% approval, with almost half of the votes counted. An opposition leader told Reuters than Correa had won. </p> <p>Correa is an ally of the socialist regimes in Venezuela and Bolivia, although his reforms are less radical than those of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez or Evo Morales. </p> <p>The new constitution contains a number of provisions aimed at the 38% of Ecuadorians who live below the poverty line. It guarantees free education up to and including university, increased spending on health, low-interest micro-loans, building materials for first-time homeowners and free seeds for growing crops.</p> <p>Correa is also granted greater control over the central bank and army, and the right to stand for two more consecutive terms.</p> <p>\"We're making history! Onward!\" a jubilant Correa proclaimed in his coastal hometown of Guayaquil as the scale of his victory became clear. \"This is confirmation of the citizens' revolution we're offering.\"</p> <p>Correa, 45, called it a \"clear, historic victory\" and urged Ecuadoreans to help him \"achieve a brave, sovereign and dignified homeland equitable, just and without misery\".</p> <p>The former finance minister has said the document will help to eradicate a political class that has made Ecuador one of Latin America's most corrupt countries.</p> <p>Correa has already taken a tough stance with oil companies, which he wants to accept a flat fee for extraction with no share of profits. Before a likely general election early next year, he hopes to pass a new law that will regulate mining, which he says will attract investment. </p> <p>The US-trained economist once described George Bush as \"dimwitted\" and, in reference to Ch\u00e1vez calling the US president the devil, Correa said: \"Calling Bush the devil offends the devil.\" Those comments, his policies while in office and the use of a referendum to boost his powers, including his potential time in office, have prompted unflattering comparisons with Ch\u00e1vez. </p> <p>But, while he counts Ch\u00e1vez as a friend, he has said Ecuador is not part of the same political movement and, unlike the Venezuelan leader, he has not moved to nationalise utilities such as telecommunications and electricity. </p> <p>And while Correa has opted not to renew a lease that allows US anti-drugs missions to fly out of a coastal airport in Manta, US diplomats have praised Ecuador's drug-fighting co-operation.</p>",
  "<p>Ah, meritocracy! Not so long ago, conservatives had a lock on it: no affirmative action, no A's for effort and no competitions where everyone gets a prize. People who complained that racism or sexism or any other -ism was holding them back were whiners looking for excuses. They either didn't want to work hard or, as <a href=\"http://www.aei.org/scholars/scholarID.43/scholar.asp\">Charles Murray</a> claimed in <a href=\"http://www.aei.org/scholars/scholarID.43/scholar.asp\">The Bell Curve</a>, they weren't smart enough to make the grade.</p> <p>Well, never mind. Sarah Palin has done for meritocracy what she's done for those other conservative obsessions: working mothers (you go, girl!), teen pregnancy (a challenge!), masculine authority (the first dude?) \u2013 to say nothing of gravitas, statesmanship, wisdom and all those other weighty abstract nouns George Will likes to talk about. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/magazine/21wwln-Q4-t.html\">\"I'm in love. Truly and deeply in love,\"</a> Murray told the New York Times' Deborah Solomon. \"The last thing we need are more pointy-headed intellectuals running the government.\" </p> <p>Palin is new, young, attractive, charismatic, a natural speaker. She's a fascinating combination of opposites \u2013 relatable (horrible word) and down to earth but also intense and weirdly thrilling \u2013 half Rachael Ray, half Boudicca, a warrior mom. Feminist triumph or feminist nightmare? Maybe both! She's hot in all senses of the word. If she wasn't a big reactionary, she'd make a fantastic community organiser.</p> <p>But let's be real: There is just no way Sarah Palin is equipped to be vice-president, much less president. She <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/09/25/eveningnews/main4479062.shtml\">doesn't know enough</a>; she lacks the necessary grasp of, and curiosity about, our complex world; her political philosophy could fit on a bumper sticker: Us versus Them. The lack of stamps in her recently acquired passport has been much noted (yes, I know, Bill Kristol, Lincoln was not a big traveler, either); it isn't even clear she's well acquainted with the Lower 48. She's prepping for her debate with Joe Biden like a student jock cramming for a test. </p> <p>The McCain campaign, tacitly acknowledging how out of her depth she'll be no matter how many all-nighters she pulls, demanded \u2013 and, shockingly, got \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/us/politics/21debate.html?_r=3&amp;hp=&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;adxnnlx=1222012918-2DtfEEFMgNwnXK/xsOLZTg\">special modifications to the VP debate</a> format so that there would be no follow-up questions. After all, it wouldn't be right to expect Palin to compete on normal terms with Joe Biden, who has the totally unfair advantage of being deeply versed in domestic and foreign policy and knowing how the world's business is done. Lower standards for potential leaders of the world's most powerful country, in the name of diversity. That's what Republicans stand for now.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton said her campaign put 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling. Sarah Palin, adding that \"the women of America aren't finished yet\" \u2013 as if women had stormed the barricades to nominate her \u2013 claimed her election would \"shatter the glass ceiling once and for all.\" </p> <p>That's ridiculous. </p> <p>The glass ceiling is the invisible barrier of gender prejudice that prevents women, as a class, from rising to the level that their qualifications and abilities merit \u2013 the level they would reach if they were men. Like her or not, Hillary Clinton was more than equipped to run the United States; her nomination would have been a true glass-ceiling breakthrough. But Palin's only qualification for the second or, God forbid, the first job in the land is that John McCain thought she'd lend his sagging campaign a shot of estrogen and some right-wing Christian fairy dust.</p> <p>Whether or not the gambit succeeds, it has nothing to do with recognising accomplishment, experience or even steady old boring competence. Just ask McCain's gaffe-prone economic adviser Carly Fiorina, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=a7BaPm66_UCw&amp;refer=us\">ushered off the stage </a>after she pointed out that Sarah Palin couldn't run a major corporation. Fiorina, who was fired as CEO of Hewlett Packard after a fairly disastrous tenure, ought to know. Or ask Olympia Snowe, Susan Collins, Condoleezza Rice, Hawaii governor Linda Lingle or the many other Republican women McCain could have chosen had he cared about governing. As has been known to happen in less exalted workplaces, Palin got the promotion because the boss just liked her. She will do no more to shatter the glass ceiling for other women as a group than such women usually do.</p> <p>There's an upside, in that the old attack on Obama as a lightweight who is inexperienced and overreaching has all but vanished. Plus, there's the fun of watching conservative pundits scramble to deny the obvious. \"There are Republicans who are unhappy about John McCain's selection of Sarah Palin,\" acknowledged William Kristol in his <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/01/opinion/01kristol.html\">September 1 column</a>. \"Many are insiders who highly value \u2013 who overly value \u2013 'experience.'\" </p> <p>Ah yes, experience. What is that, anyway? My people choose their leaders by inspecting the entrails of chickens, and the gods have always multiplied our herds! Besides, as Rush Limbaugh said recently: \"She'll be surrounded by a sea of advisers.\" Hmmm, where did I hear that before? Was it not in 2000, when doubts were raised about whether George Bush could handle the job?</p> <p>The stress on high-end conservative pundits is <a href=\"http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MDZiMDhjYTU1NmI5Y2MwZjg2MWNiMWMyYTUxZDkwNTE=\">beginning to show</a>. These are people, after all, who belong to the Ivy-educated, latte-drinking, Tuscan-vacationing urban elite they love to ridicule and who see themselves, however deludedly, as policy intellectuals and grown-ups. They've written endlessly about \"excellence\" and \"standards\". McCain's erratic flounderings, and Palin's patent absurdity, have driven <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/26/opinion/26brooks.html?ref=opinion\">David Brooks</a> and <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/22/AR2008092202583.html\">George Will</a> to write columns so anguished I'd feel sorry for them had they not made their bed by spending the past eight years rationalising the obvious inadequacies of George Bush.</p> <p>I want the people running the country to be smarter and wiser and more judicious and more knowledgeable than I am.

Democrats have been more supportive of the need for a rescue plan, while Republicans were quick to reject the initial proposals. </p> <p>However, their backing for the latest package saw the bail-out bill pass its first major hurdle.</p> <p>Concerns over the legislation's passage through Congress hit stock market confidence today. </p> <p>London's FTSE 100 index dipped more than 3.5%, with banking shares particularly affected, while Wall Street was expected to suffer when trading opened.</p> <p>Bush said he was confident that the new version of the bill would be backed by Congress, and told US voters the rescue plan was the right step to take to prevent the financial crisis from spreading across the economy.</p> <p>He admitted that the bill was bold and would be a difficult vote - especially during an election year - calling it \"an extraordinary agreement to deal with extraordinary problems\".</p> <p>\"With this strong and decisive legislation, we will help restart the flow of credit so American families can meet their daily needs and American businesses can make purchases, ship goods and meet their payrolls,\" he said.</p> <p>The president argued that the checks written into the legislation would ensure US taxpayers benefited from a number of safeguards.</p> <p>He said he expected \"much, if not all\" of the $700bn cost to the taxpayer to be paid back.</p> <p>Nevertheless, he warned that, even with a bail-out, the US would still face serious challenges as the housing market crash continued to put pressure on the economy.</p> <p>\"I'm confident that, in the long run, America will overcome these challenges and remain the most dynamic and productive economy in the world,\" he said.</p> <p>Bush praised leaders \"on both sides of the aisle who came together when our nation was counting on them\" during the \"sometimes difficult\" negotiations.</p> <p>The final proposal would allow the US treasury to buy up distressed mortage-backed securities held by financial institutions. The government would later resell the assets after they had recovered much of their value.</p> <p>Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, said the treasury would post details of all transactions on the internet within 48 hours.</p> <p>In a major concession, the bill will set limits on salary packages for Wall Street executives whose companies benefit from the legislation. </p> <p>The Democrats have the votes to push the measure through Congress - but that could be politically risky in an election year.</p> <p>Public resentment at the idea of a rescue package for Wall Street is growing, but leaders are arguing that a bail-out will benefit ordinary Americans.</p>",

  "<p>Well, it's a new week, and it's time to start pondering what the McCain campaign's next stunt might be. </p> <p>The Times (UK) offered <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/us_elections/article4837644.ece\">a good one</a> yesterday: Bristol Palin and what's-his-name may get married before the election. The article notes that she turns 18 on October 18. Money quotes:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"It would be fantastic,\" said a McCain insider. \"You would have every TV camera there. The entire country would be watching. It would shut down the race for a week.\"...</p> <p>...\"What's the downside?\" a source inside the McCain campaign said. \"It would be wonderful. I don't know that there has ever been a pre-election wedding before.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>Whether this is one crackpot in the campaign just dreaming or something more than that we don't know. But honestly. We've really heard it all now. If this actually happens, it will verify every worst thought any person could have had about John McCain and Sarah Palin and then some. It will be evidence not merely of their cynicism, but truly of some kind of disease in their brains, some form of sociopathy that I think most Americans will see for what it is.</p> <p>Back on planet Earth, though, the stunt possibilities are still virtually limitless. It's just not possible to predict, because to be able to predict, you'd have to be able to think like these people, and no normal human can do that. So we'll just need to wait.<br></p>",
  "<p>The NYT did <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/28/us/politics/28gambling-web.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin\">a huge piece yesterday</a> on McCain, gambling and gaming interests in Washington. The substantive nut graf is this:</p> <blockquote> <p>Mr. McCain portrays himself as a Washington maverick unswayed by special interests, referring recently to lobbyists as \"birds of prey.\" Yet in his current campaign, more than 40 fund-raisers and top advisers have lobbied or worked for an array of gambling interests \u2014 including tribal and Las Vegas casinos, lottery companies and online poker purveyors. </p> </blockquote> <p>This is one of those stories that's part Girl Scout and part school slut, i.e., part high-minded and part down-and-dirty. Naturally, the school slut part is far more interesting.</p> <p>The article goes into some detail about McCain's love of shooting craps. Some friends and I have been discussing: is this a bad thing? The guy does bet <em>thousands </em>of dollars, and we know that when he's betting that big he's really betting his wife's money. But I guess if she doesn't mind, the rest of us shouldn't mind (although we do not of course <em>know </em>whether she minds).</p> <p>All that said, craps is a stupid game. <a href=\"http://www.samefacts.com/archives/john_mccain_/2008/08/poker_and_craps_are_not_tweedledum_and_tweedledee.php\">Here's Michael O'Hare</a> at samefacts on the difference between poker and craps:</p> <blockquote> <p>The difference between a crapshooter and a poker player is not a matter of taste in generally similar games. Poker is a game of nearly infinite subtlety and complexity, in which money is managed across a constantly changing information landscape as deep as the psychology and perspicacity of all the players. Smart poker players are much better at it than dumb ones, though smart in the usual sense is not enough to be good at it. Some people are bored with poker and can't concentrate on it well enough to succeed, but not because it's beneath their intelligence. The nearest analogy is investing in securities, or perhaps commanding small units in combat, except for the team aspect of the latter and the impersonal dimension of the former. </p> <p>Craps, like roulette and a slot machine, is a simpleminded exercise whose players pay a fee for a particular kind of reptile-brain excitement. It is not social, and no player can change the odds on the next move, which are a set of nine numbers that never change (though more complicated side bets are possible, they also depend on a fixed small set of probabilities). There is no such thing as being good at craps, and no such thing as being a steady winner. Anyone for whom it is a preferred pastime strikes me as a person scratching a psychological itch that's best understood as a character or intelligence defect. I am genuinely appalled to learn that this idiotic fidgeting absorbs McCain for any significant time.</p> </blockquote> <p>I should note that all gambling just bores me to tears (fortunately), so I have trouble differentiating, but I see O'Hare's point. Poker does require some form of patient intelligence, whereas with craps it's just a...well, I guess there's a reason they call a \"crapshoot\" a crapshoot, isn't there? If nothing else, it seems safe to say that if you love craps the way McCain does, you love adrenaline rushes based totally on chance. That's not the most reassuring character trait in the world for a nuclear-age, terrorism-age president.<br></p>",
  "<h2>From Mississippi to Capitol Hill</h2> <p>Over the weekend, the spotlight returned from Mississippi, scene of Friday's presidential debate, to Capitol Hill - where late last night party leaders announced they had reached an agreement on a bailout plan, which they must now <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2008/sep/29/useconomy.globaleconomy\">sell to their members in Congress</a>. (Barack Obama and John McCain both gave <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/29/uselections2008.wallstreet\">tentative backing to the plan</a>; President Bush was due to give a televised address on the subject before the US markets open this morning.) Meanwhile, the post-debate spin continued, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/sep/27/barackobama.johnmccain\">the emerging wisdom was intriguing</a>: despite the conclusion initially reached by almost every pundit, among voters Obama seemed to have won, albeit narrowly.</p> <p>An LA Times poll over the weekend backed up the findings of instant polls of debate viewers, giving the debate to Obama by 49% to 44%, and suggesting that McCain's relentless attacks on Obama's level of experience had not overcome the Republican's pinched and contemptuous body language. By a big majority of 46% to 33%, poll respondents found Obama more \"presidential\". This proves that media commentators know nothing - or, alternatively, that we're at last beginning to learn what regular, non-political-junkie Americans make of the candidates. Perhaps McCain only seemed on good form in comparison to his weaker performances in the primaries, to which pundits paid far closer attention than the population at large.</p> <p>On ABC yesterday, McCain responded to the accusation that he hadn't been able to look his rival in the eye. \"I don't look at my opponents,\" he said, \"because I'm focusing on the people and the American people that I'm talking to.\" And in clashing ads over the weekend using footage from the debates, the McCain campaign mocked how many times Obama had said he agreed with his opponent; the Obama campaign noted that McCain never mentioned the middle class once.</p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>Obama is in Denver today for a rally; McCain and Sarah Palin will appear in Columbus, Ohio, while Palin's parents will sit for an interview on early-morning television. But most eyes will be on Washington and the emerging bailout plan. Meanwhile, keep an ear out for any further developments in a rumour floated in the (London) Times at the weekend: might there be a \"popularity-boosting pre-election wedding\" between Bristol Palin and her fiance Levi Johnston?</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>Yesterday's tracking polls - based on a three-day average, one day of which was after Friday's debate - all gave Obama the lead: Gallup had him on 50% to McCain's 42%, one point shy of the Democrat's best-ever performance in that poll, while Rasmussen put the candidates at 50%-44%.</p> <h2>On theguardian.com now</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/29/uselections2008.useconomy1\">Gary Younge: America has a terrible headache</a><br><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2008/sep/29/useconomy.globaleconomy\">Video: Nancy Pelosi reacts to the bailout</a><br><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/29/uselections2008.useconomy\">World briefing: Bypassing bipartisanship</a><br><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/sep/28/uselections2008.sarahpalin\">Video: Suzanne Goldenberg meets Michegan's hockey moms</a><br><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/cartoon/2008/sep/29/george.bush.gordon.brown\">Cartoon: Martin Rowson on the bailout</a><br><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/28/usforeignpolicy.useconomicgrowth\">Comment is free: A shattering moment in America's fall from power</a></p> <h2>The best of the rest</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2200924/\">Tie goes to Obama</a><br><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0908/14023.html\">Marathon becomes a brawl</a><br><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/id/161325\">Newsweek: The vices of their virtues</a><br><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/28/opinion/28rich.html?em\">New York Times: McCain's suspension bridge to nowhere</a><br><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/27/AR2008092702169_pf.html\">Power shifts from NY to DC</a></p> <h2>Quote of the day</h2> <p>\"In all due respect, people going around and sticking a microphone while conversations are being held, and then all of a sudden that's a person's position?

Embarrassingly, that's essentially Barack Obama's position.</p> <h2>Timewaster of the day</h2> <p>Generate random <a href=\" http://interviewpalin.com\">Palinesque interview responses</a>, based on the candidate's real words. It's alarming how often these sound lifelike.</p>",
  "<p>Paul Krugman <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/29/opinion/29krugman.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;pagewanted=print\">endorses the bailout</a> in the NYT today -- well, mostly:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>The bailout plan released yesterday is a lot better than the proposal Henry Paulson first put out \u2014 sufficiently so to be worth passing. But it's not what you'd actually call a good plan, and it won't end the crisis. The odds are that the next president will have to deal with some major financial emergencies.</p> </blockquote> <p>Krugman goes on to skewer McCain in zesty fashion:</p> <blockquote> <p>The real revelation of the last few weeks, however, has been just how<br>erratic Mr. McCain's views on economics are. At any given moment, he<br>seems to have very strong opinions \u2014 but a few days later, he goes off<br>in a completely different direction.</p> <p>Thus on Sept. 15 he declared \u2014 for at least the 18th time this year \u2014<br>that \"the fundamentals of our economy are strong.\" This was the day<br>after Lehman failed and Merrill Lynch was taken over, and the financial<br>crisis entered a new, even more dangerous stage.</p> <p>But three days later he declared that America's financial markets have<br>become a \"casino,\" and said that he'd fire the head of the Securities<br>and Exchange Commission \u2014 which, by the way, isn't in the president's<br>power.</p> <p>And then he found a new set of villains \u2014 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,<br>the government-sponsored lenders....</p> </blockquote> <p>And so on. A truly ridiculous performance.</p> <p>So how did McCain's stunt from last week go down? Not so well. It probably didn't cost him major credibility among the general public in the way it did among insiders, who almost uniformly saw it for the act of political grandstanding and changing the subject that it was. I'm not sure how completely that message got out to regular voters. And as I wrote Saturday, it did succeed as a rearguard action in terms of getting the story off Rick Davis' mortgage lobbying.</p> <p>But what McCain and Steve Schmidt wanted out of the ploy was credit to their campaign for \"solving\" this crisis, and that they will not get. If anything, the conventional wisdom on this is, as I heard on NPR this morning, that McCain's dash to Washington last week gummed things up. </p> <p>And now <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/28/AR2008092802212.html?hpid=topnews\">he'll meekly vote for the package, as Obama will</a>. And typically, McCain had almost nothing to say about the substance of the plan, while Obama, in Detroit, at least offered this:</p> <blockquote> <p>Obama called the need for a bailout \"the culmination of a sorry period in our history, in which reckless speculation and greed on Wall Street and lax oversight from Washington led to a meltdown of our financial markets.\" </p> <p>Obama said that as president he would order a review of the bailout plan to ensure it meets the principles he sought, including strict oversight and limits on executive pay.</p> </blockquote> <p>The people are getting lots of opportunities these days to see the difference between a serious person who's actually ready to lead and a craps player who thinks that, if it's not about matters of war and peace, it's all just politics.<br></p>",

  "<p>Now here's an interesting prediction from a breakfast fringe meeting at the Tory conference today. John McCain will beat Barack Obama on November 4, but serve only one term. In consequence the next presidential contest in the United States will be fought between Vice-President Sarah Palin and Senator Hilary Clinton.</p> <p>No, I don't believe it either. Too much is now changing too fast in our world for any safe prediction \u2013 this one came from Francis Maude MP \u2013 to be made about how things will be in 2012. </p> <p>When \"Nuclear Jack\" Welch, the tough old boot who masterminded General Electric (GE) for years decides \u2013 as he did the other day \u2013 that this is the Big One, we had all better fasten our seatbelts.</p> <p>Put it another way, my old Guardian colleague, <a href=\"http://www.simonwinchester.com/\">Simon Winchester</a>, now a highly-successful, US-based author \u2013 Krakatowa, The Doctor of Crowthorne etc - likes to tell the story of how he lectured in New York on the coming perils of global warning, explaining how rising levels of the world's oceans may drown us all. </p> <p>\"Well, not New York of course,\" someone in the audience observed. Yes, New York too. Not quite the flood Winchester predicted, but it may now be happening.</p> <p>Back to Birmingham, the presidency and the Tory conference. There's a building they've dubbed \"the freedom zone\" behind the main conference hall. It's where the libertarian right is parading its views, possibly unaware that our fast-changing world is making many such views a bit of a luxury.</p> <p>This morning a group called the \"DC Tories\" \u2013 ie Brits who live in Washington \u2013 got a couple of senior American backroom types to debate the relative merits of Senators McCain and Obama, with Ed Cox (Richard Nixon's son-in-law) for the Republicans, and Bill Barnard (an ex-professor at Oxford) for the Democrats.</p> <p>In truth, both were rather safe and dull. The two Tory MPs who had attended the two conventions, Brooks Newmark for McCain and Francis Maude at what he admitted was the \"brilliant\" Obama launch in Denver, were both much livelier. US politics tends to the earnest these days: it has done them little good lately.</p> <p>Anyway Cox argued that on the key issues - freedom, opportunity, accountability, limited government and a strong defence \u2013 his man has a long and solid track record while Obama does not. </p> <p>The world is a far more dangerous place than it was in the early 90s, he added. Putin, not Yeltsin, Hizbullah and Hamas, not the Oslo Accords, a near-nuclear Iran, Danny Ortega back in power in Nicaragua, another ally for that Hugo Ch\u00e1vez.</p> <p>Oh yes, and China on the rise. Not yet a world power, but an economic power in east Asia (they still don't get it, these guys do they?), it is in a position to tail the US Seventh Fleet, which protects Taiwan. If the Chinese CP senses its power ebbing it will play the nationalist card against Taiwan, he said.</p> <p>Good point, though he didn't say what he thinks the US will be able to do about it. </p> <p>McCain understands this stuff and made a brave stand in favour of the US military \"surge\" which has stablised Iraq \u2013 even George Bush was initially against it. He didn't mention him by name, Bush's name barely featured at all.</p> <p>Bill Barnard should have made short work of all that, but he was a bit flat. He agreed about priorities, but said the Democrats had a better record on all of them. Didn't mention Obama too much either, now I reflect on it. </p> <p>McCain's record deserved respect, but wasn't any where near as good as claimed. He seems obsessed with process, not with substance. On the two issues where he's broken with his party on substance \u2013 the amnesty for illegal immigrants and carbon emissions \u2013 he has been forced to backtrack.</p> <p>Since Cox had made much of McCain's judgment, Barnard retaliated by saying that a man of 72 with skin cancer problems who picked Sarah Palin as his running mate when he barely knew her was not a man whose judgment voters should trust.</p> <p>Alaska looks big, but it has just 700,000 citizens \u2013 \"less than Birmingham\", he pointed out. As for Obama's tax-and-spend instincts, his tax cut for 95% of taxpayers could be funded simply by reversing the Bush tax cuts for the very rich \u2013 so great had those cuts been.</p> <p>As I suggested earlier, those sort of exchanges are way out of whack with reality as it is emerging on Wall St, Main St and New St Birmingham, which has five building society offices in a row. Brooks Newmark, MP for Braintree and himself a City figure, weighed in behind McCain and said: \"I love Sarah Palin.\" </p> <p>Why? Because she is a change candidate, a small town mayor who took on her party's establishment and became governor. All right, she's a Christian fundamentalist who kept her own Down's baby and made her pregnant 17-year-old daughter marry the boy and keep their baby. Easy to mock in Europe, but up to 150 million Americans think the same way. That is true \u2013 at least in theory \u2013 and it is a sobering thought.</p> <p>Francis Maude called Obama \"a formidable performance artist\" whose Denver acceptance speech he would long remember. Studiously neutral as to his own preference (many Tories favour Obama) he agreed that the next president should engage better with the world - and that either will do that. Unusually, both are change candidates, both outsiders.</p> <p>Two interesting details I'd not heard before. </p> <p>One: Barnard said that McCain wanted Senator Joe Lieberman, the ex-Dem independent from Connecticut who ran with Al Gore in 2000, to be his running-mate. But he was warned it would split the convention and provoke walk-outs. So he took Palin after a brief meeting.</p> <p>Two: Cox said that George Bush had a very optimistic view of the prospects for democracy in 2001 \u2013 \" very Rousseau-ian,\" he said, not a label you hear much. So did Condi Rice. After her experience with Yeltsin's Russia they both thought that, if you got rid of the bad guys, democracy would take root easily. </p> <p>\"You Brits, with your experience of the world, know better.\" The audience liked that, of course. Did anyone land a killer blow? No, but they agreed it is a remarkable election.</p>",

  "<p>Ahmadinejad's anti-Semitic tirades seem to be coming straight out of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion\">Protocols of the Elders of Zion</a>. While it is true that he sometimes comes across as more of a clown than a serious leader of a powerful country striving to be a major player in world politics, I do not agree with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/sep/23/mahmoud.ahmadinejad.united.nations\">Lionel Beehner</a>'s suggestion that we should disregard Ahmadinejad in determining policy towards Iran. It must be made clear that a man like him has no place in the world order. </p> <p>In principle I favour cool, rational analysis over visceral gut reactions when it comes to strategic policy decisions. But it is wrong to belittle the importance of an event like Ahmadinejad's <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article4811646.ece\">telling the UN</a> his paranoid fantasies about Zionist domination of the world and the financial markets. There are red lines the crossing of which the civilised world must react to forcefully and unequivocally, as the French foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, did recently (and he certainly cannot be accused of rightwing sabre-rattling).</p> <p>So how can rational analysis be combined with a forceful, principled and emotionally charged stance in dealing with Iran? </p> <p>This issue played an important role in the first <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/sep/27/uselections2008.barackobama\">US presidential debate</a>, aired on Friday night. McCain took an intransigent stance that refuses direct engagement with Iran, whereas Obama favours direct talks without preconditions.</p> <p>I am a staunch supporter of Obama and I think his geopolitical understanding is superior to McCain's. Obama is, by his very identity, both American and cosmopolitan, and he has a much clearer sense of the incredible harm the last eight years have done to the US's standing in the world. He would probably use soft power in ways that could defuse much of the tension that has built up between the Islamic world and the west.</p> <p>His position is also supported by several experts on Iran I have spoken to. All of them say that Iran has felt for a long time that it is not receiving its legitimate place as a major player in the Middle East, and that the only way to defuse the situation is to find ways of letting them in. And all of them say that Iran has never forgiven the US for its intervention in 1953 when the CIA helped topple Mossadeq.</p> <p>Finally (and surprisingly), all of them say that most Iranians still have an instinctive liking for the US, but cannot find a way towards rapprochement, and that it is probably the one Muslim country in the Middle East that has a chance of becoming a modern democracy in the foreseeable future. Hence Obama's idea of engaging in some kind of dialogue with Iran is certainly the right strategic choice.</p> <p>But Obama's anaemic stance towards Ahmadinejad during the debate does not serve him and his strategic proposal well. He did not muster the aggression needed to make it clear, beyond any doubt, that a leader like Ahmadinejad has no place in the community of nations. It would serve Obama well to express much more visceral condemnation of Ahmadinejad, taking his cues from Bernard Kouchner.</p> <p>Precisely because Obama understands that Ahmadinejad is not the ultimate authority in Iran, he must reach out to the Iranian people with a clear message. \"Your demand for a respectable place in the community of nations is heard and taken seriously. But you must also know that you will pay a heavy price for re-electing Ahmadinejad, and that that such a choice will leave your country in the position of a pariah state rather than a legitimate partner for dialogue.\"</p> <p>A forceful message of this sort would increase Obama's stature as a leader who speaks both to the mind and to the heart; it would help him win the hearts of Jewish voters in the US and it would calm the worries of Israelis who are deeply anxious about Iran's race to acquire the bomb.</p>",
  "<p>The opposition in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/belarus\">Belarus</a> has failed to win a single seat in parliamentary elections, with pro-government candidates sweeping the board, the country's election commission announced today.</p> <p>The result raises serious doubts about President Alexander Lukashenko's commitment to democratic reform and his pledge that Sunday's elections would be free and fair.</p> <p>Britain and the EU had offered to review sanctions against Belarus if the poll showed an improvement on previous fraudulent ballots.</p> <p>This morning, opposition leaders in Belarus said Sunday's election was rigged and called on the west not to recognise the result.</p> <p>\"There was no election in Belarus. It was an electoral farce,\" Anatoly Lebdko, leader of the opposition United Civil party, told the Associated Press. \"We call on the EU and US not to recognise the results of this election.\"</p> <p>The democratic opposition failed to win any of the 110 parliamentary seats up for grabs despite fielding 70 candidates. Only pro-Lukashenko deputies were elected to the lower chamber, the house of representatives.</p> <p>On Sunday, Lukashenko insisted the elections would be more transparent than previous polls and would usher in a new era of improved relations with the west. \"If the election goes smoothly the west will recognise Belarus,\" he said.</p> <p>Referring to the US secretary of state, Condeleeza Rice - who in 2005 branded him Europe's last dictator - he said jokingly: \"Dictator, last dictator, fine, let it be so.\"</p> <p>Today, the Belarus central election commission head, Lidia Yermoshina, said the poll had been fair. Explaining Lukashenko's landslide victory, she said: \"The voter is afraid of losing what he has.\"</p> <p>As soon as polls closed last night, about 500 opposition supporters turned out in protest on the central square of the capital, Minsk. Many waved European Union flags.</p> <p>\"We are tired of living in fear, we are tired of repression,\" said Natalya Kurilovich, 34. \"I'm tired of Lukashenko stealing votes. I want a European future for my children.\"</p> <p>Several hundred young protesters marched to the headquarters of the KGB, the country's secret police, and chanted \"shame\" outside the building.</p> <p>The EU has denounced previous elections in Belarus. In 2006, the US and EU imposed travel bans on Lukashenko and 40 of his senior officials, accusing him of fraudulently arranging his re-election.</p> <p>More recently, the west has shown interest in improving ties with Minsk. Western relations with Moscow have nosedived after last month's war in Georgia and amid a row over Russia's claim to a \"privileged interest\" in former Soviet states.</p> <p>Opposition figures say Sunday's poll was fixed last week. The government had used \"administrative resources\" to force students and others into early voting, they said, and opposition monitors were banned from polling stations.</p> <p>\"Again there are no democratic elections in Belarus. The house of representatives can't be considered democratic since members will be nominated by Mr Lukashenko's finger,\" said Vintsuk Vechorka, the co-chairman of Belarus's main opposition group, the United Democratic Forces.</p> <p>He told the Guardian: \"Lukashenko doesn't want to improve elections. He wants to improve his image in the eyes of the west. He's trying to survive between Putin's KGB Russia and the west. He wants better relations with the west so he can trade with Putin.\"</p> <p>Lukashenko, in power since 1994, has made recent concessions to western critics. In mid-August he released Belarus's last three political prisoners. Unlike four years ago, he allowed the opposition to take part and campaign in the elections.</p> <p>Lukashenko allowed in around 400 election monitors from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Over the weekend he insisted the poll would be free and fair. \"We are conducting the elections by the dictates of the OSCE,\" he said.</p> <p>The OSCE is due to deliver its verdict on the elections today. European diplomats say they do not expect the poll to conform to the standards of a mature democracy but are looking for modest signs that the country is moving in the right direction.</p> <p>Lavish subsidies and benefits have made Lukashenko broadly popular among the country's 10 million people.</p> <p>He has quarrelled with Moscow over energy prices and his relations with Vladimir Putin, Russia's powerful prime minister, remain tense.</p>"
