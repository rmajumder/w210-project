  "<p><strong>Good morning, ladies.</strong><br>Ashlyn: [Cheery] HI!<br>DiAnne: [Bouncy] HI!</p> <p><strong>[Small Talk realises the lobby of a plush London hotel might be a bit noisy to conduct an interview, so relocates to the bar]</strong><br>Waitress: Can I get you and the ladies a drink?</p> <p><strong>[Small Talk realises with dawning horror it only has 7p in its pockets] Um\u2026</strong><br>Ashlyn: \u2026<br>DiAnne: \u2026</p> <p><strong>[Ashlyn and DiAnne catch Small Talk desperately scanning their tracksuits for signs of a wallet or purse. Small Talk stares furiously at the floor in embarrassment] Can we just sit here for a bit?</strong><br>Waitress: [Testily] So you don't want a drink then?</p> <p><strong>[Quietly] No. [Attempting to come up with a question that doesn't make Small Talk sound patronising, like a pervert or a patronising pervert]. So, DiAnne and Ashlyn do you come to London often?</strong><br>DiAnne: We've been here before to promote the NFL. We're having fun over here, we've visited schools and we're on a TV show called Loose Women later today. [Cautiously] Do you know it?</p> <p><strong>Know it? Small Talk's got every episode on VHS, Blu-ray <em>and</em> DVD. Is it hard work being a cheerleader? </strong><br>DiAnne: We all hold down jobs or are students \u2013 I'm going to medical school next year and Ashlyn is at college studying marketing. <br>Ashlyn: We practice every Tuesday and Thursday for up to three hours and once you add in the time we spend at home games it comes to 19 hours, and that doesn't include work we do in the community. </p> <p><strong>You reached the holy grail of cheerleading last night when you appeared at Watford v Cardiff. Small Talk imagines it will be a comedown when you have to go back to the Louisiana Superdome.</strong><br>DiAnne: [Possibly uttering the phrase for the first time in history] Watford was fun! The fans really enjoyed us and cheered us on. We love dancing. <br><strong><br>Yeah, but Watford is a bit, well, Watford.</strong><br>DiAnne: [Conceding the point slightly] It was a bit muddy, but we still had fun. It was great.</p> <p><strong>Where are all the male cheerleaders in the NFL? Can't a guy with a just a dream and a pair of dancing shoes get a break these days?</strong><br>Ashlyn: The Green Bay Packers have male and female cheerleaders, so they perform more stunts and flips. We're more of a dance group than a cheerleading group - we don't do stunts, we dance and spur the crowd on.</p> <p><strong>Do you have rivalries with other teams? Ever tempted to stove a Cowboys cheerleader's head in with your pom-poms?</strong><br>Ashlyn and DiAnne: No! <br>DiAnne: We meet girls from other teams and make friendships and sometimes go and see how their routines and practice sessions differ from ours.</p> <p><strong>Bah! Small Talk was, like, totally lied to by Bring It On. On to the players: is it true your contract says you're not allowed to date them?</strong><br>DiAnne: That's a big no-no. Only because it helps keep the professionalism of the game. I think if they were to allow that it might cause distractions and the players are there to do their job and we're there to do ours. Its pretty much a standard rule across the NFL.</p> <p><strong>It might not have been so easy to resist if you were cheerleading Ian Ormondroyd-era Aston Villa. On to world issues now. Who's going to win the US election?</strong><br>DiAnne: [Politely but firmly] We don't talk about politics. We do Saints politics though and they'll win on Sunday!</p> <p><strong>Is that in your contract too? All Small Talk's says is it has to stay away from that sixth-for\u2026 Anyway, George Bush used to be a cheerleader, who'd make a better one: Dubya, Barack Obama or John McCain? <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_life_and_military_career_of_John_McCain#Release\">Who admittedly can't raise his arms above his head</a>, but there you go.</strong><br>Ashlyn: All three.<br>DiAnne: We'd put all three on the team.</p> <p><strong>But John McCain can't raise his arms above his head\u2026</strong><br>Ashlyn: It's just like our team, everyone brings something different. It makes a team a team.<br>DiAnne: Exactly, we're different ages and different looks and it adds to the uniqueness.</p> <p><strong>Top politicking, ladies. Tom Brady or Our Brave David Beckham: which one would you date, contract permitting?</strong><br>Ashlyn: Oooh! I'm going to have to go for David Beckham.<br>DiAnne: [With relish] They're both handsome, so I'll go for Tom Brady to even it out.</p> <p><strong><br>What's the last CD you bought?</strong><br>DiAnne: Rihanna, I just put the album on my iPod.<br>Ashlyn: I can't remember\u2026<br>DiAnne: Was it Maroon 5? [Small Talk recoils in pain]<br>Ashlyn: Actually, Britney Spears' Blackout. </p> <p><strong>A lion and a tiger have a disagreement over how to solve the world economic crisis and things unfortunately turn nasty. Who gets to nationalise our banks?</strong><br>DiAnne: The tiger because he's king of the jungle.<br>Ashlyn: Since I'm from Louisiana and my father's a huge LSU fan I'm going to have to say tiger because the team are the Fighting Tigers.</p> <p><strong>And finally, what would you put in Room 101? </strong><br>Ashlyn: Bad drivers. <br>DiAnne. I agree and you get them all over the world. Our drivers are great but they had to go over all these speed bumps on the way to the soccer game yesterday. It was pretty shaky.</p> <p><strong>Ah yes, the road to Watford has been the ruin of many a man. And with that Small Talk bids you farewell.</strong><br>Ashlyn and DiAnne: Thanks Small Talk, it was great to meet you.</p> <p><strong>[Small Talk parts with the two beautiful women who will fly back to the sun in a few days.

  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Friday October 31 2008</strong></p> <p> Our calculation of the chances of four out of five US presidents being left-handed was slightly awry in the article below. We gave the probability as 0.00009, given that one in 10 of the population is left-handed. That is the probability of any particular sequence of one right-handed and four left-handed presidents. The odds of that occurring in any order would be 0.00045</p> <p> </p> <p>Amid the many conspiracy theories swirling around the US presidential race - Barack Hussein Obama's Islamist takeover, say, or John \"Bush\" McCain's plans to steal the election - a truly sinister confluence of events has largely gone unnoticed.</p> <p>Some see the devil's hand at play in an election that, whatever the outcome, will see America make a a fundamental shift, not from right to left, but from right-handed to left-handed.</p> <p>Both Obama and McCain are sinistral - lefties to you and me - in contrast to the present incumbent of the Oval office. One of them will be the fourth left-handed president out of the five past holders of the world's most powerful office, a fact that has intrigued neurologists and confounded probability theorists.</p> <p>Obama or McCain will become the 44th US president, and within that distinguished company will be the eighth known to be left-handed. The victor will become the sixth lefty out of 12 presidents since the end of the second world war, stretching back to Harry Truman.</p> <p>The other postwar lefties-in-chief are Gerald Ford, the ambidextrous Ronald Reagan, George Bush Sr and Bill Clinton. Since 1974 the only right-handed presidents have been Jimmy Carter and the outgoing Bush.</p> <p>Roughly one in 10 of the population is left-handed, so to have four out of five recent incumbents in the top job drawn from that group is striking: the probability is 0.00009.</p> <p>Some statisticians would say it is just a coincidence that over time will be evened out. Certainly, the prevalence has been lower among the 12 postwar British prime ministers; only two of them, Churchill and Callaghan, were left-handed. But Daniel Geschwind, a professor of human genetics at UCLA, thinks it is beyond coincidence.</p> <p>\"Six out of the past 12 presidents is statistically significant, and probably means something,\" he said.</p> <p>Membership of the rarefied group also extends across the political divide and into US public life. Apart from Obama and McCain, it includes the TV mogul Oprah Winfrey, the Nobel peace prize laureate Al Gore, New York mayor Michael Bloomberg and Homer Simpson's neighbour Ned Flanders.</p> <p>Geschwind points out that there are established differences in brain patterns. The language function lies in the left hemisphere of the brain for 98% of right-handed people, but is on the left for only about 60% of left-handers. About 10% of lefties have their language function on the right hemisphere - far more than their right-handed brethren - and about 30% straddle both sides.</p> <p>How these factors play out in practice is only thinly understood, but it may help to explain why there are a disproportionate number of left-handed maths professors at MIT, for instance, as well as artists from Michelangelo to Paul Klee, not to mention Winfrey, Gore and Bloomberg.</p> <p>Left-handed US presidents go back to James Garfield, who, legend has it, could write in Latin with one hand and simultaneously write the same sentence in Greek with the other.</p> <p>The rollcall has not always been a happy one. Garfield was assassinated in 1881 (though the assumption that left-handed people are prone to an early grave has been debunked). Herbert Hoover was the second confirmed left- handed US president, and we know all too well what happened under him.</p> <p>Fidel Castro is also a member of the club, as is Osama bin Laden.</p> <p>Over the centuries, southpaws, as they have been known since the early days of baseball - have had a rough ride. Etymology tells the story. \"Sinister\" comes from the Latin word for left, later taking on the connotation of evil or unlucky.</p> <p>According to the Left-Handers Club, a support group based in Surrey, the Devil is almost always portrayed as left-handed. The basics of life, from desks to scissors and computer mouses, are geared to the right-handed majority. Which is why Ned Flanders in the TV series The Simpsons set up a shop called the Leftorium.</p> <p>Kristy Ainslie, a biomedical engineer in San Francisco, knows all about these inconveniences from personal experience. Eight months ago she set up a Facebook group, Lefties for Obama, partly as a satire on the way Obama has been depicted as someone outside the mainstream.</p> <p>She thinks there may be something to the presidential cluster of lefties: \"When you are left-handed you have your own unique perspective and have to be willing to stand out from the crowd. That's not bad training for a president.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Ed Pilkington is right-handed</p>",
  "<p>He is renowned for his long hours and hectic schedule, but the stress of high office may be taking its toll on the health of Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and jeopardising his political future.</p> <p>Speculation about the hyperactive leader's physical condition was prompted this week after a speech to the state statistics and planning body on Wednesday was cancelled at the last minute and a cabinet meeting took place without him. A speech to a martyr's commemoration event was also called off. A senior aide, Amir Mansour Borghei, told journalists that the president was \"indisposed\".</p> <p>That explanation has triggered rumours that Ahmadinejad, 52, is suffering from a long-term illness that may force him to abandon plans to stand for re-election next year.</p> <p>Shahab, an Iranian news website, reported that the cancellations were the latest in a series and said the president had previously cancelled engagements because of listlessness caused by low blood pressure. Last May Ahmadinejad pulled out of events in three consecutive weeks - including a rally in Golestan province where he was due to meet voters face to face - because of what aides described as an overcrowded schedule.</p> <p>Citing \"sources close to the government\", Shahab said doctors had advised him to cut his workload to reduce the possibility of illness. There is little sign that he has heeded such advice; Wednesday's cancellation came after Ahmadinejad had returned to Tehran from a visit to the Asalouyeh oil and gas project in southern Iran. </p> <p>The reports of cancellations come at a time when Ahmadinejad is wrestling with acute political problems, including near 30% inflation, rising unemployment, plummeting oil prices, a market traders' strike over a plan to impose VAT, and demands for the resignation of his interior minister, Ali Kordan, for falsely telling MPs that he had an Oxford University degree.</p> <p>But more worrying is that the rumours appear to have given his critics a new stick to beat him with. Fellow hardliners inside Iran's so-called principalist - or fundamentalist - camp are calling for the president to withdraw from the presidential election unless doubts about his health are cleared up.</p> <p>Issa Saharkhiz, an Iranian political analyst, said the reports could have been fanned by Ahmadinejad's opponents, including the Tehran mayor, Muhammad Baqer Qalibaf, who are preparing to run against him. \"I'm not sure if these health problems are permanent or just a result of tiredness,\" he said. \"But some groups, mainly moderate conservatives, may be thinking that they have found a political solution for eliminating him from the nomination for the elections.\"</p>",
  "<p>When the Guardian informed me the Republicans had spent $150,000 on clothing for Sarah Palin and her family (Report, October 23), I wondered why I keep buying a paper that, at times, can be so sexist. If spend on appearance is so very important in the race to the White House, why have we not heard what the Democrats have spent on Biden's hair? Or indeed how much Obama spends on his shoes? Or McCain on suits? The constant criticism of the way Palin looks - a month ago the Guardian was criticising her for tacky earring choices - is both galling and boring. But if we're to continue obsessing over appearance, at least let's obsess over it for one and all - then we'll see how interesting it actually is.<br><strong>Rebecca Gowland</strong><br>Bridlington, East Yorkshire </p> <p>Not one of your 21 profiles to illustrate creativity (What were you thinking at 10.04pm, G2, October 22) was from science or engineering.

  "<p>'I could never pursue a career in politics,\" croaks a figure sprawled across a sofa in the corner of a darkened room, skater's sock-cap pulled down over his sunglasses. \"I've been involved in far too many scandals.\"</p> <p>\"My mom says you have too many tattoos,\" laughs the fresh-faced, baseball-capped boy beside him.</p> <p>\"Yeah, too many scandals and too many tattoos,\" grins the skater. \"Isn't that an irony, though, now that so many of our generation have tattoos? A tattooed person will end up in office one day, mark my words. Not necessarily at a presidential level, but there will be people with tattoos in the administration.\"</p> <p>It seems Pete Wentz - the bass player, songwriter and public face of Fall Out Boy - has a dream. This morning, however, he also has a head cold, jetlag and a hangover. It is midday, and Wentz appears near-comatose, resembling the fictional rock star Hotblack Desiato from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, who spent a year being dead for tax reasons. </p> <p>The night before, Fall Out Boy arrived in Barcelona to celebrate the opening of their latest Angels &amp; Kings nightclub, a party that stretched on into the early hours of this morning. But discussion of the group's new album, Folie \u00e0 Deux, which the band planned to release on the day of the American presidential election, has shaken him from his daze.</p> <p>\"Releasing the album on the same day as the election was an entirely conscious decision,\" explains Patrick Stump, the one in the baseball cap, who plays guitar and sings. \"Like, I went to sleep last night with BBC News 24 on, and there was a guy from India explaining that the outcome of the American election would have an effect on the whole world. If that's the case, then I don't know why we're taking it so lightly. This might be the most important election my generation get to vote in, and there's a lot of responsibility upon the American people, to really pay attention this time. But people are behaving like it was a sporting event, waving flags and yelling, 'Go team!'\"</p> <p>Accordingly, Folie \u00e0 Deux contains no partisan sloganeering, although Stump contends the songs share a common message, focusing on \"the effects of individuals' actions upon the larger world, as a result of the poor decisions they make. So maybe they should think about the consequences of their actions.\"</p> <p>Certainly, a deviation into the explicitly political territory of Rage Against the Machine would be a jarring change of direction for Fall Out Boy. While their roots lie in Chicago's underground punk scene - Wentz and drummer Andy Hurley played in Racetraitor, a late 90s hardcore troupe who espoused veganism, anti-imperialism and grisly riffage - Fall Out Boy are, inarguably, a pop band, one whose rise was aided by the support of MTV's mainstream pop show Total Request Live, which helped them find an audience that is largely teenaged and largely female.</p> <p>Wentz's disaffected, sometimes solipsistic lyrics - along with his olive-skinned good looks - have made Fall Out Boy poster boys for the emo generation of teens, their hormonal and existential angst finding a reflection in Fall Out Boy's tantrum-tossed anthems. He's become the erudite voice of a particular stratum of youth: the suburban kids who, like Wentz, have been diagnosed with emotional problems, and have struggled with both prescribed medication and illicit chemicals.</p> <p>\"I think that medication has helped me at times in my life,\" explained Wentz when I interviewed him last year, after a show in Las Vegas. \"I've needed to be on medication, it's saved my life. But it's definitely an over-medicated generation. Rather than having any kinds of conversations with anyone to solve our problems, we go and see what pill we can take to make it all go away.\"</p> <p>Wentz is bipolar, and in 2005 he attempted to kill himself with an overdose, an event that inspired the song 7 Minutes in Heaven (Atavan Halen) on Fall Out Boy's breakthrough album From Under the Cork Tree. He subsequently filmed public service announcements for American television, highlighting the issue of youth depression. But the confessional, emotional tenor of his lyrics is tempered by his witty wordplay; the best Fall Out Boy songs make for classic neurotic American teen pop culture, like the John Hughes movies Wentz worships.</p> <p>\"I feel like the last person who should be giving advice to anyone about anything,\" Wentz says of the fans who deluge Fall Out Boy's website with desperate pleas for help. \"I think part of it is we're living in the age of the internet: if it had been around back in the days of the Smiths and the Cure, I'm sure people would be writing to their website, asking, 'Oh Morrissey, I'm so depressed. too, what should I do?'\" He laughs at the idea.</p> <p>Wentz's fame isn't limited to his fans, though. He became a tabloid figure in 2006, when an ex-girlfriend leaked naked photos Wentz had taken of himself on to the internet. Latterly, he has become a staple in America because of his marriage to the actress and pop singer Ashlee Simpson. </p> <p>The couple, who are expecting their first child before the year is out, are now regulars on Perez Hilton's gossip blog, and Wentz featured in a Vanity Fair piece in summer 2007 about the boyfriends of the young Hollywood women who are the centre of LA's gossip culture. \"Everyone writes stories about Ashlee and I going out to nightclubs or whatever,\" he said, in Vegas, \"but nobody writes about how much fun we had just riding mountain bikes and hanging out in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. There was no one there to recognise us. It was fun, being 'normal' like everyone else. It's like a weird fantasy to have.</p> <p>\"I feel good now,\" Wentz continues, \"like I wish I could take deaging juice and go back to when I was 16 or something, and relive it all again knowing what I know now. The things that were difficult in my life have remained or become more difficult; it's like the song, Mo Money Mo Problems. But I'm 29 now, I have a wife, and a baby on the way. I see the world in an entirely different way.\"</p> <p>In downtime from Fall Out Boy, Wentz runs his own record label (Decaydence), clothing company (Clandestine Industries) and film production company (Bartskull), while also pursuing careers as an author, model, actor and host of his own show on MTV. The Barcelona branch of Angels &amp; Kings is Fall Out Boy's third; they opened their first in New York. </p> <p>All three bars share a d\u00e9cor - black painted walls hung with framed mugshots of Jimi Hendrix, Steve McQueen and Frank Sinatra - though the Barcelona venue, located on the sixth floor terrace of the newly opened ME Hotel, with its own outdoor heated swimming pool, is the most impressive. \"We saw this location and thought it was cool,\" Wentz says, of the offer to open in Barcelona. \"To be this close to Gaudi's Sagrada Familia couldn't ever be a bad thing. We've realised we have an 'aesthetic', that we are a brand,\" he adds. \"When you're a brand, you have to be careful who you partner with.\"</p> <p>Memories of Wentz's darker, more hedonistic days still offer raw material for Folie \u00e0 Deux, most explicitly on 27, with its references to \"Doing lines of dust off last night's stage/ Just to feel like you.\" Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison and Kurt Cobain all died when they were 27, and Wentz says he spent much of that year \"toxic, just completely over-medicated. I was stoked to make it past 27,\" he grins. \"Everyone was really worried. My management company were panicked, because I was I was out of the office, and 'pharmaceutically engaged'.\"</p> <p>\"There was a countdown clock and everything,\" laughs Stump. \"I remember, our manager called me up on Pete's 28th birthday and screamed, 'We made it!'\"</p> <p>As our interview draws to a close, Stump returns to the topic of the album's election day release. \"The point is,\" he concludes, \"when Folie \u00e0 Deux's released, we won't be partying at some record company album launch, we'll be out there voting. And I hope a lot of other people are, too.\"</p> <p>Several days later, however, Fall Out Boy announce via their website that Folie \u00e0 Deux won't see the shelves until early December, a decision they made themselves. \"This is not the election to be 'cute',\" they explain, adding: \"We feel that many of the interviews for the record have skewed us into a partisan band. We never intended to shove our ideas down people's throats.\"</p> <p>The decision seems less motivated by a desire to protect their \"brand\" from the sort of fan backlash the Dixie Chicks suffered after speaking out against George Bush in 2003 than by an earnest desire to not cloud the election season with what could be viewed as a promotional gimmick. They also realise that, in such a climate, even the most earnest attempt by a celebrity to enter the partisan fray could clumsy backfire on his chosen candidate. </p> <p>There can be no doubt on who that is for Fall Out Boy. In Barcelona, Stump said, \"All four of us fall more on the liberal side of things,\" while the video for their new single I Don't Care closes with a villainous character pulling back a mask to reveal he's really Sarah Palin. And earlier in the summer, they played at the Democratic convention in Denver, though Stump didn't get to meet Obama. </p> <p>\"I wish,\" he chuckles. \"But that's not important. I don't want it to taint the message of the record, which is that we're not considering the issues, or our actions, hard enough.\" </p> <p>Stump says he has friends and relatives who are Republicans, and he respects their views, and believes that \"everyone, regardless of their party affiliation, should at least consider voting for the other side, to truly get to understand their policies and positions.\" He can't resist adding, however, that \"people should be willing to understand that the vice president could possibly become president, and to think about the implications of that.</p> <p>\"People need to research the policies of the candidates closely - and that includes Obama - and not be distracted by the media misrepresentations. Like Fox News: their bias is so blatant, it's offensive. They don't report news. If there was a school shooting, they'd be finding ways to blame it on the Democrats. I think it would be a shame if somebody voted for Obama because so many celebrities support him. I think it would be tragic if someone voted for McCain because Fox News doesn't know shit.</p> <p>\"It's really easy to offend people in America right now. You have to tread lightly. My stepdad is very right wing - at the dinner table we'll have pretty frank political conversations, but I'm not going to have that same conversation at a restaurant in public, where the guy behind me might be totally offended.\"</p> <p>\"But that's where you're supposed to have those conversations,\" protests Wentz. \"And loudly. Although I try not to provoke people anymore, because I don't think the judge will let me off with any more community service.\" </p> <p>He laughs, but then turns serious, perhaps dreaming again of America's first tattooed president. \"I want to work on humanitarian causes in some capacity, and that'll involve working with both parties, I expect. So I'm trying not to upset anyone.\" </p> <p>\u2022 The single I Don't Care is out now on Mercury. Folie \u00e0 Deux is released on December 15</p>",
  "<p><strong>This is an election, so whoever gets the most votes wins, right?</strong></p> <p>No. Elections are awarded to the winner of the electoral college. Each state is allocated from three to 55 votes according to its population. The winner of the popular vote wins a state's electoral votes - with two exceptions, Maine and Nebraska, which award electoral votes by congressional district. A candidate that wins 270 electoral votes is the winner. Think of it as 51 elections (50 states plus Washington DC) instead of one national election.</p> <p><strong>What if the winner of the electoral college has won fewer popular votes?</strong></p> <p>This has happened three times in US history, most recently in 2000. Under the US Constitution the presidency nevertheless goes to the candidate who wins the electoral college.</p> <p><strong>That sounds undemocratic</strong></p> <p>It is. America's founding fathers were loth to give too much power directly to the people and so devised a system similar to the Vatican's college of cardinals. The US constitution gives to the electors of the electoral college the power to choose the president, but extends to the states authority to determine how the electors are chosen. Initially the legislatures of several states chose the electors. Now, states choose electors by a direct vote of the people. Moves to use the national popular vote have failed, in part because small states and rural areas fear losing their disproportionate influence.</p> <p><strong>What are the most important states?</strong></p> <p>California, New York and Texas offer the most electoral votes- 55, 31 and 34. But those are not up for grabs: the first two states are safely Democratic, and Texas votes Republican. The candidates spend most of their time in a handful of states that could vote either way, notably Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania.</p>",
  "<p>Political strategists and pollsters refer to them as the \"triple A\" states, the handful that will determine the outcome of this <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselections2008\">election</a> and where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a> are focusing their energy, best people and cash over the final days.</p> <p>Identifying the states is easy: they are the ones that in the last few weeks have received the highest number of visits from the candidates, the biggest volume of advertising and where the campaign teams have placed their best staff.</p> <p>Huge swaths of the US, from reliably Democratic California to solidly Democratic New York are ignored, as are Republican bastions such as Texas. Instead, campaign foot soldiers are battling from dawn to midnight in a relatively small number of states and, in most cases, in a small number of counties within those states.</p> <p>Mark Mellman, a pollster for the John Kerry campaign in 2004, identified these toss-up states as Pennsylvania, Florida and Ohio, traditionally big swing states, but also new ones that until a few weeks ago would have been regarded as safely Republican, Virginia and Missouri.</p> <p>\"These are the triple A states,\" Mellman said. Also on the list is Colorado, Nevada and North Carolina, which was an even more unlikely swing state a few weeks ago than Virginia. \"Any of these could be decisive,\" said Mellman.</p> <p>McCain's hopes of taking the White House have dwindled to one state, Pennsylvania, which voted Democratic in 2004. He needs to take this and hold on to Ohio, the key to the midwest where Obama is ahead in the polls, and Florida, where the two candidates are in a dead heat.</p> <p>Obama, having made inroads into a host of Republican states, has many more options. If he does not make it in one state, there are a host of others that could still swing the election his way.</p> <p>McCain spent yesterday in Florida - as hotly contested as Pennsylvania - and Obama was there for two days earlier this week. Both men are certain to return to the Sunshine state at least once in the final week - Pennsylvania and Ohio also.</p> <p>Since the official start of the campaign on September 5, Ohio and Florida have each been visited 20 times by Obama or McCain or their running mates. Pennsylvania has been visited 16 times, Virginia 13, and Colorado and Missouri 11 times each. New Hampshire and North Carolina have both had seven, Nevada and New Mexico five, Indiana four and Maine one.</p> <p>The other indicator to which states are the most hotly contested is spending on advertising. Evan Tracey, the president of the Campaign Media Analysis Group, which tracks ad spending, said the presidential race always whittles down to a few states. \"In every one of these states advertising is very heavy. These are the states they know they have to win.\"</p> <p>The difference in the 2008 campaign is that Obama's encroachment into traditionally Republican areas means that McCain is having to spend money in states traditionally his party thought it could take for granted. </p> <p>\"Obama has McCain exactly where he wants him. McCain's team would not have planned on fighting in North Carolina in October. He would rather be spending money elsewhere,\" Tracey said.</p> <p>Republican and Democratic strategists involved in past campaigns say the pace will become even more frenetic in the final days, with planned schedules altered at the last minute based on overnight polls.</p> <p>Pennsylvania appears to be an odd choice for McCain to make what is effectively his last stand. Many analysts and pollsters, such as Mellman, no longer include Pennsylvania in their lists of battleground states because Obama is regarded as so far ahead: two polls yesterday placed him ahead by 10% and 11% respectively.</p> <p>But Mark Salter, McCain's chief strategist, told reporters in the state on Tuesday: \"When we look at our numbers, we think we're competitive here.\"</p> <p>Democrats in Pennsylvania agree. Its Democratic governor, Ed Rendell, sent a memo this week to Obama's headquarters warning that the state is traditionally volatile. Rendell, who went into election day for the governorship in 2002 with a 25% lead but won by 9%, urged Obama to make more visits to the state.</p> <p>Karlyn Bowman, an election analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, the neoconservative thinktank in Washington, said Obama would win the election but she understood why McCain was concentrating on Pennsylvania.</p> <p>\"Remember how well Hillary Clinton did there,\" Bowman said, recalling Clinton's victory over Obama in the state earlier this year, mainly with the support of white, blue-collar workers.</p> <p>In Florida campaign teams are concentrating on a relatively narrow strip, the Orlando-Tampa corridor. Registration figures there for July indicate just how tight it is, with 159,000 recorded Republicans and 157,000 Democrats.</p> <p>Another indication of the fierceness of the fight is that the ratio of negative ads by McCain and Obama is higher in that area than any other part of the country.</p> <p>Obama can lose Florida and still win by taking states such as Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Virginia, all of which voted Republican last time. Virginia would be a big prize; a southern state that has voted Democrat only once since 1948, and that was for Lyndon Johnson in 1964.</p> <p>Michael Dimock, an associate director of research at the Washington-based Pew Institute, said that in 2000 and 2004 the number of battleground states remained basically the same from the start of the campaign to election day. But this campaign had turned out to be more fluid as polls showed Obama becoming competitive in traditionally Republican areas. States such as Michigan, that had been competitive at the start, and which received more visits than any other, had since dropped out of the contest, with McCain giving them up as lost.</p> <p>Dimock sees the potential changes in the offing comparable to Bill Clinton's win in 1996 and Johnson's in 1964, all the more remarkable given that they were southern politicians and Obama is from the north.</p> <p>Though the intense campaigning taking place in the battleground states in 2008 mattered, it was less important than the economic meltdown and the unpopularity of George Bush, said Dimock. \"Even in the best circumstances, it would be hard for McCain to do well.\"</p>",
  "<p>\"Dog whistle tactics\" has become something of a political cliche, but three years ago, the term - which means campaigning on issues so high-pitched that only certain voters can hear them - was all but unheard-of.</p> <p>It took Phil Woolas, a one-time TV producer, trade union official and Labour MP, to point out that the mix of immigration and health in Michael Howard's 2005 election campaign had been developed in Australia and had a name. After a few lunches with political journalists, the idea of \"dog whistle tactics\" entered the political lexicon.</p> <p>Woolas might have been quick to spot it because he does a good line in whistling. Within 10 days of becoming immigration minister this month, Woolas went on record to say he believed immigration should be limited and the British population capped at 70 million. A little further from his brief, he also floated the possibility that the Church of England would become disestablished.</p> <p>For these two moments of political candour, Woolas was pulled from appearing on Question Time last night, a rare move that betrayed government alarm at a gaffe-prone minister.</p> <p>Yet those who know him say these are not gaffes. The former cabinet minister Peter Hain, who has known Woolas since university and whose campaign for the deputy leadership was run by the junior minister, said: \"He's astute, savvy, canny and completely aware of the 24-hour media cycle. The idea that he didn't mean his comments is wrong.\"</p> <p>Another Labour MP, John Mann, his best friend, best man and political ally since the first day at Manchester University, said he was \"never reckless and never thoughtless\". </p> <p>Back then, his greatest gaffe was a visual one - appearing on television as the National Union of Students president to push for an ultimately successful boycott of Barclays Bank, always wearing the same green ties. It was not until he was diagnosed as colour blind that he realised he hadn't been wearing the red ties beloved of Labour politicians.</p> <p>Mann says Woolas has always been a contrarian. \"Back in the 80s he took up causes of antisemitism like the campaign for Soviet Jewry. These were so-called fringe activities.\" </p> <p>Tim Gardam, the then editor of BBC's Newsnight, remembers Woolas from his time on the programme as \"very clever and very forthright\", and someone \"who would clearly become a politician\". Another producer remembers a swot. \"He was always sitting on the desk of the editor of the programme that day. A bit too buoyant.\"</p> <p>And then add some stunts. When Woolas went to become communication manager at the GMB union he brought a herd of pigs to London and got Nottinghamshire miners to shepherd them through the streets to decry the excesses of City financiers.</p> <p>Some of his comments may just be audible stunts: a way of getting heard. A green lobbyist who worked with him when he was climate change minister felt Woolas always had an eye on the story rather than policy - defending genetically modified food against Prince Charles and the green lobby.</p> <p>But these tactics do not seem to be accidents. The Liberal Democrat MEP Chris Davies, who fought Woolas in a byelection, remembers a man in control. He said: \"He was archetypal new Labour - he never expressed anything from the heart. So he has either now escaped the shackles of new Labour or is being calculating to the last punctuation mark.\"</p> <p>The calculation would be that his constituency has a high proportion of white working-class voters alienated by immigration. While ministers have started to raise this problem in the last few years, Woolas said seven years ago that Labour would lose out to the BNP unless it did more to \"create a country at ease with itself\". More recently, he has raised the possibility that the Muslim Pakistani community was fuelling birth defects by intermarrying between first cousins. </p> <p>Mann says his friend is simply more in touch with real voters than the metropolitan elite. \"He's the politician who I regard to be most in touch with British people, friend and foe alike. What he was saying was quite clear and he ought to be left to carry on saying these things. What I do know is that this debate will be continued.\"</p> <p>Hain agrees. \"There are too many politicians these days who are just technocrats rather than have political experience. But Phil is a real politician.\"</p> <p>Far from being embarrassed by Woolas, Gordon Brown is supposed to have tasked him with humanising the immigration brief. Pulling Woolas from Question Time is probably a sign of a government taking the long view - the drama of the withdrawal will be forgotten more quickly than if the straight-talking minister did some more straight talking. </p> <p>In the words of one former minister, what they don't want is for Woolas to \"say something to distract from the George Osborne story. But I bet you he'll be on Question Time in a few weeks.\"</p> <h2>CV</h2> <p><strong>Born</strong> December 11 1959</p> <p><strong>Education</strong> University of Manchester, BA (hons) philosophy</p> <p><strong>Family</strong> Married to Tracey Jane Allen, two sons</p> <p><strong>Career</strong> Positions include: National Union of Students president, 1984-86; journalist, Television South, 1987; assistant producer, BBC Newsnight, 1988-90; producer, Channel 4 News, 1990-91; head of communications, GMB, 1991-97; MP for Oldham East and Saddleworth, 1997-; lord commissioner of the Treasury, 2002-03; deputy leader of the House of Commons, 2003-05; minister of state, Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs,</p>",
  "<p>The signal weird moment of the last week in entertainment and politics (which are the same thing, as we shall see) was the simultaneous appearance on Saturday Night Live of Sarah Palin, the laughing stock of literate America, and Josh Brolin, whose performance in W had just opened nationwide. And this only moments after Palin and her SNL doppelganger Tina Fey had slunk past each other on stage - a double-take moment straight out of Multiplicity or Dead Ringers.</p> <p>Then there was John McCain's return voyage to the hotseat of the David Letterman show after ducking out of a previous appearance. McCain fancies himself the model for Maverick, the hotshot flyer in Top Gun, and certainly there is a similar air of homoeroticism wafting around McCain's male inner circle. On Letterman, however, he was manfully staging his own McCain Mutiny against reality itself, shifting in his seat, defending Palin, badmouthing his opponent, and doing everything short of clacking Captain Queeg's silver ball-bearings in his cupped palm.</p> <p>The election is full of these bizarre moments where showbiz trumps the news - the most brutal interrogations McCain has yet faced have been on Letterman, the housewives' coffee-klatsch show The View, and with Ellen Degeneres - and the campaign is so filled with U-turns, red herrings, cliffhangers and serial climaxes that one barely needs go near the multiplex for white-knuckle entertainment. Just keeping up with Palin's alter egos - the French populist Pierre Poujade and Australia's Pauline Hanson in politics; Tracy Flick, Marge Gunderson, Peggy Hill (and Tina Fey's spoof) in fiction - is enough to set your mind reeling.</p> <p>And movie references are ever near at hand. When the economy collapsed, I thought of Alan Pakula's 1981 financial thriller Rollover, in which the Arabs withdraw every dime from American banks; the film closes with a global montage of runs on banks, food riots and collapsing societies - par-TAY! The most harrowing predictions of the slump's possible aftermath made me rent Blindness and Children of Men, and hunger after another viewing of Mad Max II. I'm hoping the forthcoming adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's The Road will furnish me with plenty of post-apocalyptic survival tips (memo to self: pack crossbow, wolf-repellent and cyanide capsules).</p> <p>The self-immolation of the Republican party resembles nothing so much as the death throes of the Terminator in T2: Judgment Day (and that's what this is for the GOP's current incarnation). As the liquid metal monster is consumed in a vat of molten steel, all of the identities it has assumed - cop, dog, stepmom- burst one last time to the surface like a satanic greatest-hits medley, each flickering to life for a moment before issuing a savage, horrifying sound, like vomiting through a scream, before the lava sucks them under. The same is happening to the Republicans as they play the race card, the terrorist card, the elitist card and the anti-American card against their opponent. It is a magnificent process to behold, better than football, better than porn, better than T2, even.</p> <p>Oddly, we've heard little this season of that perennial electoral bete noire, Liberal Hollywood, perhaps because this year the celebrity-political imbalance is so stark. While the mass of household names long ago pledged for Obama, McCain must settle for the likes of Gary Sinise, Patricia Heaton and the increasingly intemperate far-rightie Jon Voight. The Dem-GOP Celebrity Imbalance Ratio can be expressed thus: Alec Baldwin (D); Stephen Baldwin (R). It's a rout.</p> <p>Add to that the antihagiography-cum-celluloid casket that is W., and an excellent documentary, Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story, which arrives just in time to chronicle the birth-pangs of Rovean politics (Atwater was Karl Rove's mentor) and to serve as their death-knell, and, well, you have quite the spectacle.</p> <p>No wonder people are calling this election \"a Referendum on Reality\".</p>",
  "<p>The Republican party showed signs of disarray yesterday over the prospect of a Barack Obama presidential victory being matched by sweeping gains on November 4 by the Democrats in Congress on a scale not witnessed since the 1930s.</p> <p>Figures show the Democrats outspending the Republicans 4-1 in congressional races across the country. Democrats are also being helped by huge turnouts of African-Americans and young voters in states where Obama is unlikely to win but where those in congressional races stand to benefit.</p> <p>Among indications of panic yesterday, the National Republican Congressional Committee pulled $50,000 (\u00a331,000) in ads scheduled for broadcast from Monday for Michele Bachman, a Republican congresswoman from Minnesota. The party effectively disowned her over remarks she made on television on Friday in which she said Obama \"may have anti-American views\". The committee is also withdrawing funding from other congressional races seen as futile contests.</p> <p>If Obama won the White House and the Democrats gained more seats in the house and Senate - and even reached the magic 60 seats in the Senate that would allow the Democrats to override any Republican attempts to filibuster legislation - he would potentially be in one of the strongest positions enjoyed by any Democratic president since Roosevelt in 1932.</p> <p>Tom Mann, a political analyst at the Brookings Institution, said yesterday the Democrats could gain seven to 10 senate seats and 20 to 30 in the House. </p> <p>With polls showing Obama extending his lead in key states, John McCain fought yesterday on a \"Joe the plumber\" platform, saying an Obama presidency would mean tax increases for the working and middle classes. He also returned to the theme that Obama is too inexperienced to face an international crisis.</p> <p>Obama, after a rally in Indianapolis, abandoned campaigning temporarily to visit his ailing grandmother, Madelyn Dunham, in Hawaii. In a CBS interview Obama said he did not want to repeat the mistake of not being at his mother's bedside before she died. He said of his grandmother: \"We knew she wasn't doing well, but you know, the diagnosis was such that we thought we had a little more time and we didn't.\"</p> <p>The Republican party is facing tight races across the country in congressional seats it would normally regard as safe. Even Elizabeth Dole, a Republican senator from North Carolina, which has been Republican for 35 years, is on the defensive, with an ad warning voters that the Democrats should not be allowed total control of the White House and Congress. The Democrats had struggled to find someone to stand against her, given she was regarded as unassailable, but the eventual candidate, Kay Hagan, now enjoys a narrow poll lead.</p> <p>In Minnesota, Bachman's Democratic rival, Elwyn Tinklenberg, had also been regarded as a no-hoper. But since Bachman's remarks about Obama, Tinklenberg has been the beneficiary of a backlash, taking in $1.3m in donations since Friday.</p> <p>The non-partisan Campaign Finance Institute reported on Wednesday that the Democratic Congressional Committee has spent $37m since August on behalf of its Congressional candidates, compared with the NRCC's $9.6m.</p> <p>Democrats are expected to make gains in the Senate in southern states such as Mississippi, Kentucky and Georgia, where there are big African-American populations, many of whom are set to turn out for the first time to vote for Obama.</p>",

  "<p>With all due respect to my esteemed colleague Jonathan Freedland, I feel compelled to contest his theory that the belle of this year's Republican ball <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/23/sarahpalin-uselections2008\">will be back in the presidential chase</a> come 2012.</p> <p>A victory for John McCain would certainly give Palin the chance to rehabilitate her approval ratings and consolidate her appeal to the conservative base in preparation for a future presidential run. But if Barack Obama becomes president next year \u2013 and <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1008/14838.html\">it's a bigger assumption</a> than most liberals would like to think right now \u2013 Palin is going to have a devil of a time making a viable bid for the White House.</p> <p>The first factor holding her back is the same enemy that Palin often decries before her rapt audiences: the media. Every publication from the New Yorker to <a href=\"http://www.fieldandstream.com/article_gallery.jsp?ID=1000022649\">Field and Stream</a> magazine descended on <a href=\"http://www.adn.com/sarah-palin/story/514173.html\">rural Wasilla, Alaska</a> after Palin joined the Republican ticket last month, and the resulting crush of damning press created a string of ready-made attack adverts for any possible opponent in 2012.</p> <p>Imagine if John Edwards, the 2004 Democratic vice-presidential nominee, had emerged victorious as his party's nominee this year. </p> <p>Even if Edwards's infidelity had not become public, Republicans would be subjecting him to a daily re-litigation of the same battles that brought down the Kerry-Edwards ticket four years ago. His campaign would be watched hawkishly for the slightest hint of a reversal on the issues \u2013 and so would Palin's in 2012. </p> <p>Given that the Alaska governor can barely keep her positions straight over a period of weeks on topics as sensitive as military action inside Pakistan and judicial refinancing of mortgages, you'd better believe that Democrats would salivate at the chance to fact-check her four years from now. Not to mention, operatives will be watching to see whether Palin's pricey designer clothes show up at the Salvation Army after the election.</p> <p>The second drag on Palin's political future is her state. Yes, Alaska is certainly remote and offers scant opportunities for national political exposure. But most importantly, it also <a href=\"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/08/a-look-at-sarah.html\">lacks a substantial fundraising base</a> from which Palin can extract the cold, hard cash necessary to run for president four years from now.</p> <p>Her best chance to build a network over the next four years as governor is courting the major oil companies. But Palin was correct in noting that her independent-minded approach to the Alaska natural gas pipeline turned off Exxon and the other energy giants.<br> Sarah Barracuda is certain to remain in the good graces of Bill Kristol, Fred Barnes and other A-list conservative pundits who are <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/10/27/081027fa_fact_mayer?currentPage=2\">enthralled by her stage presence</a>. (Peggy Noonan, as it happens, is far from a Palin fan these days.)</p> <p>Still, even if Kristol &amp; Co can give her entr\u00e9e to the Washington power elite \u2013 something tells me McCain won't be in the mood to share after a loss this year \u2013 Palin is bound to watch her approval ratings suffer in Alaska as she openly plans another run at the White House.</p> <p>On the subject of approval ratings, they happen to be the third factor imperilling Palin's presidential future. Polling is generally untrustworthy on the details, but Palin's numbers paint a distressing picture: the more voters get to know her, the less they like her.</p> <p>After Palin stormed onto the national stage with her combative convention speech last month, she boasted a <a href=\"http://people-press.org/report/?pageid=1375\">54% positive rating</a>. Five weeks later, her approval rating <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aYI5UQWvIChI&amp;refer=home\">had fallen to 44%</a>, compared with 60% for Democratic No 2 Joe Biden.</p> <p>Voter perceptions of Palin also have suffered back in Alaska, albeit on a smaller scale. Does anyone think the bespectacled governor will be able to return home quietly for two years of fighting environmental regulations? Palin had better start getting used to the pesky media tracking her every move on the local level, particularly her clashes with Alaska critics <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/14/palin-criticized-in-alaska/?pagemode=print\" ?>Andree McLeod</a>, <a href=\"http://www.adn.com/politics/story/497064.html\">Andrew Halcro</a> and <a href=\"http://blog.blogtalkradio.com/2008/09/09/anne-kilkenny-on-blogtalkradio-this-afternoon\">Anne Kilkenny</a>. </p> <p>Four years from now, Palin is unlikely to be enjoying the 80%-plus approval that gilded her emergence this autumn, especially if she faces a difficult re-election fight in 2010. </p> <p>That brings me to the fourth and final reason that Palin 2012 is less of a sure thing than Freedland and others believe. Palin's term expires in 2010, the same month that Republican Lisa Murkowski must defend her Senate seat. </p> <p>Having spectacularly unseated Murkowski's father, Frank, in order to become governor, Palin may well decide that knocking off another Murkowski is her best path to broader power. The Senate would be the best perch for Palin to keep an eye on a potential President Obama if she wants to run in 2012 \u2013 which would surely depend on how vulnerable Obama is to a successful challenge by that point.</p> <p>But wait: Palin would first have to win that Senate seat. And although she energises the conservative base now, she does so largely through prepared talking points, depicting Obama as a \"pal\" of terrorists and McCain as \"the only man\" who can defend America. The next several years will test her ability to delve into the more substantive critiques that are required of both Senate and presidential candidates. </p> <p>Before Palin and her fans in the <a href=\"http://marcambinder.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/10/palin_1.php\">media</a>-<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/uselection2008/sarahpalin/3242610/Republicans-considering--Sarah-Palin-2012-presidential-campaign.html\">political</a>-<a href=\"http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_plank/archive/2008/10/22/prediction-palin-in-2012.aspx\">industrial</a> complex get psyched about a 2012 run, she'd do well to bone up on policy.

  "<p>Political strategists and pollsters refer to them as the \"Triple A\" states, the handful hat wil determine the outcome of this election and where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a> are focusing their energy, best people and cash over the final days.</p> <p>Identifying the states is easy: they are the ones that in the last few weeks have received the highest number of visits from the candidates, the biggest volume of advertising and where the campaign teams have placed their best staff.</p> <p>Huge swaths of the US, from reliably Democratic California to solidly Democratic New York are ignored, as are Republican bastions such as Texas. Instead, campaign foot soldiers are battling from dawn to midnight in a relatively small number of states and, in most cases, in a small number of counties within those states.</p> <p>Mark Mellman, a pollster for the John Kerry campaign in 2004, identified these toss-up states as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/pennsylvania\">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/florida\">Florida</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/ohio\">Ohio</a>, traditionally big swing states, but also new ones that until a few weeks ago would have been regarded as safely Republican, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/virginia\">Virginia</a> and Missouri.</p> <p>\"These are the Triple A states,\" Mellman said. Also on the list is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/colorado\">Colorado</a>, Nevada and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/northcarolina\">North Carolina</a>, which was an even more unlikely swing state a few weeks ago than Virginia. \"Any of these could be decisive,\" said Mellman.<br>McCain's hopes of taking the White House have dwindled to one state, Pennsylvania, which voted Democratic in 2004. He needs to take this and hold on to Ohio, the key to the midwest where Obama is ahead in the polls, and Florida, where the two candidates are in a dead heat.</p> <p>Obama, having made inroads into a host of Republican states, has many more options. If he does not make it in one state, there are a host of others that could still swing the election his way.</p> <p>McCain spent today in Florida \u2014 as hotly contested as Pennsylvania \u2014 and Obama was there for two days earlier this week. Both men are certain to return to the Sunshine state at least once in the final week \u2014 Pennsylvania and Ohio also.</p> <p>Since the official start of the campaign on September 5, Ohio and Florida have each been visited 20 times by Obama or McCain or their running mates. Pennsylvania has been visited 16 times, Virginia 13, and Colorado and Missouri 11 times each. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/new-hampshire\">New Hampshire</a> and North Carolina have both had seven, Nevada and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/newmexico\">New Mexico</a> five, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/indiana\">Indiana</a> four and Maine one.</p> <p>The other indicator to which states are the most hotly contested is spending on advertising. Evan Tracey, the president of the Campaign Media Analysis Group, which tracks ad spending, said the presidential race always whittles down to a few states. \"In every one of these states advertising is very heavy. These are the states they know they have to win.\"</p> <p>The difference in the 2008 campaign is that Obama's encroachment into traditionally Republican areas means that McCain is having to spend money in states traditionally his party thought it could take for granted. </p> <p>\"Obama has McCain exactly where he wants him. McCain's team would not have planned on fighting in North Carolina in October. He would rather be spending money elsewhere,\" Tracey said.</p> <p>Republican and Democratic strategists involved in past campaigns say the pace will become even more frenetic in the final days, with planned schedules altered at the last minute based on overnight polls.</p> <p>Pennsylvania appears to be an odd choice for McCain to make what is effectively his last stand. Many analysts and pollsters, such as Mellman, no longer include Pennsylvania in their lists of battleground states because Obama is regarded as so far ahead: two polls today placed him ahead by 10% and 11% respectively.</p> <p>But Mark Salter, McCain's chief strategist, told reporters in the state on Tuesday: \"When we look at our numbers, we think we're competitive here.\"<br>Democrats in Pennsylvania agree. Its Democratic governor, Ed Rendell, sent a memo this week to Obama's headquarters warning that the state is traditionally volatile. Rendell, who went into election day for the governorship in 2002 with a 25% lead but won by 9%, urged Obama to make more visits to the state.</p> <p>Karlyn Bowman, an election analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, the neoconservative thinktank in Washington, said Obama would win the election but she understood why McCain was concentrating on Pennsylvania.</p> <p>\"Remember how well Hillary Clinton did there,\" Bowman said, recalling Clinton's victory over Obama in the state earlier this year, mainly with the support of white, blue-collar workers.</p> <p>In Florida campaign teams are concentrating on a relatively narrow strip, the Orlando-Tampa corridor.

Virginia would be a big prize; a southern state that has voted Democrat only once since 1948, and that was for Lyndon Johnson in 1964.</p> <p>Michael Dimock, an associate director of research at the Washington-based Pew Institute, said that in 2000 and 2004 the number of battleground states remained basically the same from the start of the campaign to election day. </p> <p>But this campaign had turned out to be more fluid as polls showed Obama becoming competitive in traditionally Republican areas. States such as Michigan, that had been competitive at the start, and which received more visits than any other, had since dropped out of the contest, with McCain giving them up as lost.</p> <p>Dimock sees the potential changes in the offing comparable to Bill Clinton's win in 1996 and Johnson's in 1964, all the more remarkable given that they were southern politicians and Obama is from the north.</p> <p>Though the intense campaigning taking place in the battleground states in 2008 mattered, it was less important than the economic meltdown and the unpopularity of George Bush, said Dimock. \"Even in the best circumstances, it would be hard for McCain to do well.\"</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338936449\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1875305338_US-Election-LT-RoanokeArtScene-To-Brightcove-16x9.flv\"/> </video>   <p><br>The introductory call of Roanoke's <a href=\"http://www.noshame.org/\">No Shame Theatre</a> is that it's a place where \"anything can happen.\" To which the crowd responds: \"And it usually does.\" </p> <p>The idea is simple. You pay $5, you get five minutes and the stage is yours. There are only a few rules, the most intriguing being that you have to keep your clothes on - apparently the state of Virginia has decreed that nudity and alcohol should not cohabit the same social space. No Shame Theatre went for the booze. Otherwise people do their own thing -poetry, stand-up, soliloquies, songs, you name it. It's like Amateur night at the Apollo in Harlem without the <a href=\"http://www.bigapplejazz.com/tree_of_hope.htm\">Tree of Hope</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.feetfirstfoundation.org/index_002.htm\">Sandman</a>.</p> <p>Some of the performances are bizarre. One woman had a puppet monkey she called George - as in George Bush - and a bag full of different hats. Her entire skit consisted of putting a different hat on the Monkey every 15 seconds and matching it with a one-liner about Bush. <br>\"George is clutching at straws,\" she'd say and on would go the straw hat. \"George has been smoking something,\" and on goes a rasta hat. Much more cringe than fringe.</p> <p>But most are good and some have a political edge. Todd Ristau, the founder of No Shame and director of the graduate programme in playwriting at Hollins University, near Roanoke, came up with the idea when he was in Iowa City and launched it on the back of a pick-up truck.</p> <p>The night I went, Ristau performed a parody of the vice-presidential debate between Joe Biden and Sarah Palin. It ended with Biden telling the audience: \"Look I'm just going to lay in on the line, if you vote those people into the White House, you deserve whatever the fuck happens to you.\"</p> <p>For a town of this size (96,000) Roanoke has an impressive cultural life. It boasts a symphony, an opera, an arthouse cinema (currently showing both Bill Maher's Religulous and Oliver Stone's W), several art galleries and museums of transport, science, transportation and history as well as one <a href=\"http://www.linkmuseum.org/ \">dedicated to the photography of Winston Link</a> and another to African-American life in the town. </p> <p>There are at least two decent independent book shops and Ristau is in the process of building another theatre. Moreover it is just about to see the opening of a huge new art museum - the Taubman http://www.artmuseumroanoke.org/ , downtown. While I have been here, the local Jefferson centre has staged a production of <a href=\"http://www.roanoke.com/extra/wb/179475 \">Falstaff</a> and played host to <a href=\"http://www.roanoke.com/extra/wb/179123\">Wynton Marsalis</a>.</p> <p>\"I'm passionately in love with this town, partially because of the way that this very admittedly blue collar community embraces a cultural life,\" Ristau says. \"And there isn't that kind of antagonism between people in the community and the so-called artist or intellectual elites. There isn't that division. Everyone takes part in the cultural life kind of equally. And I think it's a testimony to the city in some ways that they had the vision to place the centre in the square in the middle of the town and say 'no - our cultural life is going to be in the heart of this community'.\"</p> <p>And like the the No Shame Theatre , some culture has been geared towards the election. In 2004, culture was at the crux of the polarisation between Democrats and Republicans, with Michael Moore's Faranheit 9/11 and Mel Gibson's The Passion of Christ, laying out the battle lines. </p> <p>Nationally, this year it has played a far less prominent role, despite Sarah Palin's attempt to introduce hockey moms and Joe sixpack as the John and Jane Doe of American cultural life. But in Roanoke, thev ibrant cultural life has been quite politically engaged - albeit almost exclusively among liberals. Three weeks ago, Ann Trinkle, an artist who was the local delegate to the Democratic convention, put on an art auction called <a href=\"http://www.finearttoelectafineman.com/\">Fine Art To Elect A Fine </a>man which raised $4,100.</p> <p>\"When I heard [Obama] speak four years ago at the Democratic convention in Boston, I was sold right then. He has touched something in a lot of us... not since John F Kennedy, it's all about the hope, it really is. It's about the best in each of us. He's really awoken that.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, another local artist, Katherine Devine, is dedicating herself to painting yard signs and handing them out.</p> <p>Back at the No Shame Theatre, Ben Williams gives a minute-by-minute breakdown of his viewing the vice-presidential debate.</p> <p>\"9pm - My television is tuned to CNBC. Let's do this thing!</p> <p>9.02pm - It has become clear that if I'm going to sit through another hour and 28 minutes of this horseshit, I'm going to need a drink.</p> <p>9.03pm - The only remaining alcohol I have is a half-bottle of terrible legalised absinthe. Perhaps I'll just have to abstain tonight.</p> <p>9.05pm - I pour myself a tall glass of absinthe. It clouds nicely upon the addition of sugar and cold water. It certainly looks the part, but inside it's pure poison. I have accidentally made the perfect drink for watching this debate.</p> <p>9.10pm - Sarah Palin explains her views to the American people in the same way that you'd explain the basics of mathematics to a small child. Joe Biden, on the other hand, explains his views to America in the way that you'd try to talk a suicidal retarded man down from a ledge. They are both right.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Republican party showed signs of disarray today over the prospect of a Barack Obama presidential victory being matched by sweeping gains on November 4 by the Democrats in Congress on a scale not witnessed since the 1930s.</p> <p>Figures show the Democrats outspending the Republicans 4-1 in congressional races across the country. Democrats are also being helped by huge turnouts of African-Americans and young voters in states where Obama is unlikely to win but where those in Congressional races stand to benefit.</p> <p>Among indications of panic today, the National Republican Congressional Committee pulled $50,000 (\u00a331,000) in ads scheduled for broadcast from Monday for Michele Bachmann, a Republican congresswoman from Minnesota. The party effectively disowned her over remarks she made on television on Friday in which she said Obama \"may have anti-American views\". The committee is also withdrawing funding from other congressional races seen as futile contests.</p> <p>If Obama won the White House and the Democrats gained more seats in the House and Senate - and even reached the magic 60 seats in the Senate that would allow the Democrats to override any Republican attempts to filibuster legislation - he would potentially be in one of the strongest positions enjoyed by any Democratic president since Roosevelt in 1932.</p> <p>Tom Mann, a political analyst at the Brookings Institution, said today the Democrats could gain seven to 10 Senate seats and 20 to 30 in the House. </p> <p>With polls showing Obama extending his lead in key states, John McCain fought today on a \"Joe the plumber\" platform, saying an Obama presidency would mean tax increases for the working and middle classes. He also returned to the theme that Obama is too inexperienced to face an international crisis.</p> <p>Obama, after a rally in Indianapolis, abandoned campaigning temporarily to visit his ailing grandmother, Madelyn Dunham, in Hawaii. In a CBS interview, Obama said he did not want to repeat the mistake of not being at his mother's bedside before she died. He said of his grandmother: \"We knew she wasn't doing well, but you know, the diagnosis was such that we thought we had a little more time and we didn't.\"</p> <p>The Republican party is facing tight races across the country in congressional seats it would normally regard as safe. Even Elizabeth Dole, a Republican senator from North Carolina, which has been Republican for 35 years, is on the defensive, with an ad warning voters that the Democrats should not be allowed total control of the White House and Congress. The Democrats had struggled to find someone to stand against her, given she was regarded as unassailable, but the eventual candidate, Kay Hagan, now enjoys a narrow poll lead.</p> <p>In Minnesota, Bachmann's Democratic rival, Elwyn Tinklenberg, had also been regarded as a no-hoper. But since Bachmann's remarks about Obama, Tinklenberg has been the beneficiary of a backlash, taking in $1.3m in donations since Friday.</p> <p>The non-partisan Campaign Finance Institute reported yesterday that the Democratic Congressional Committee has spent $37m since August on behalf of its congressional candidates, compared with the NRCC's $9.6m.</p> <p>Democrats are expected to make gains in the Senate in southern states such as Mississippi, Kentucky and Georgia, where there are big African-American populations, many of whom are set to turn out for the first time to vote for Obama.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Friday October 24 2008. We erroneously said Michele Bachmann's surname was Bachman. This has been changed.</p>",
  "<p>Amid the many conspiracy theories swirling around the US presidential race \u2014 Barack Hussein Obama's Islamist takeover, say, or John \"Bush\" McCain's plans to steal the election \u2014 a truly-sinister confluence of events has largely gone unnoticed.</p> <p>Some see the devil's hand at play in a contest that, whatever its outcome, will see a powerful group regain control of the White House on November 4.</p> <p>Membership of the group extends across the political divide and into US public life, from the media to arts to finance. Apart from both Obama and McCain, it includes the TV mogul Oprah Winfrey, the Nobel peace prize laureate Al Gore, New York mayor Michael Bloomberg and Homer Simpson's neighbour, Ned Flanders.</p> <p>The driving force of the movement is not so much political ideology as dexterity. When President Bush quits the White House in January, America will see a fundamental shift, not from right to left, but from right-handed to left-handed.</p> <p>Both Obama and McCain are sinistral \u2014 lefties to you and me \u2014 in contrast to the present incumbent of the Oval office. One of them will be the fourth left-handed president out of the five past holders of the world's most-powerful office, a fact that has intrigued neurologists and confounded probability theorists. </p> <p>Obama or McCain will become the 44th US president, and within that distinguished company will be the eighth known to be left-handed. The victor will become the sixth leftie out of 12 presidents since the end of the second world war, stretching back to Harry Truman.</p> <p>The other postwar lefties-in-chief are Gerald Ford, the ambidextrous Ronald Reagan, George Bush Sr and Bill Clinton. Since 1974 the only right-handed presidents have been Jimmy Carter and the outgoing Bush. </p> <p>Roughly one in 10 of the population is left-handed, so to have four out of five recent incumbents in the top job drawn from that group is striking: the probability is 0.00009. </p> <p>Some statisticians would say it is just a coincidence that over time will be evened out. Certainly, the prevalence has been lower among the 12 postwar British prime ministers; only two of them, Churchill and Callaghan, were left-handed. But Daniel Geschwind, a professor of human genetics at UCLA, thinks it is beyond coincidence. \"Six out of the past 12 presidents is statistically significant, and probably means something,\" he said.</p> <p>Geschwind points out that there are established differences in brain patterns. The language function lies in the left hemisphere of the brain for 98% of right-handed people, but is on the left for only about 60% of left-handers. About 10% of lefties have their language function on the right hemisphere \u2014 far more than their right-handed brethren \u2014 and about 30% straddle both sides.</p> <p>How these factors play out in practice is only thinly understood, but it may help to explain why there are a disproportionate number of left-handed maths professors at MIT, for instance, as well as artists from Michelangelo to Paul Klee, not to mention Winfrey, Gore and Bloomberg.</p> <p>Left-handed US presidents go back to James Garfield, who, legend has it, could write in Latin with one hand and simultaneously write the same sentence in Greek with the other.</p> <p>The rollcall has not always been a happy one. Garfield was assassinated in 1881 (though the assumption that left-handed people are prone to an early grave has been debunked). Herbert Hoover was the second confirmed left-handed US president, and we know all too well what happened under him.</p> <p>Fidel Castro is also a member of the club, as is Osama bin Laden.</p> <p>Over the centuries, southpaws \u2014 as they have been known since the early days of baseball \u2014 have had a rough ride. Etymology tells the story. \"Sinister\" comes from the Latin word for left, later taking on the connotation of evil or unlucky.</p> <p>According to the Left-Handers Club, a support group based in Surrey, the devil is almost always portrayed as left-handed. The basics of life, from desks to scissors and computer mouses, are geared to the right-handed majority. Which is why Ned Flanders in the TV series The Simpsons set up a shop called the Leftorium.</p> <p>Kristy Ainslie, a biomedical engineer in San Francisco, knows all about these inconveniences from personal experience. Eight months ago she set up a Facebook group, Lefties for Obama, partly as a satire on the way Obama has been depicted as someone outside the mainstream.</p> <p>She thinks there may be something to the presidential cluster of lefties: \"When you are left-handed you have your own unique perspective and have to be -willing to stand out from the crowd. That's not bad training for a president,\" she said.<br><em>Ed Pilkington is right-handed</em></p>",

  "<p>Every day brings news of lifelong <a href=\"http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/gophome\">Republicans endorsing Barack Obama</a>. The most recent was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/19/colin-powell-endorses-barack-obama\">Colin Powell</a>, and before him <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/19/fashion/19buckley.html\">Christopher Buckley</a>, son of the founder of the modern conservative movement, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_F._Buckley_Jr.\">William Buckley</a>. Before that there were former Republican members of congress Jim Leach, Douglas Kmiec, Bruce Bartlett, Lincoln Chafee and Rita Hauser. All of them were senior members of the party who served in various previous presidential administrations or Congress. If these Republicans are willing to publicly renounce their party's candidate you can imagine how many other party leaders are unwilling to do so but privately will desert John McCain to vote for Obama.</p> <p>There has even been this <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/17/opinion/17brooks.html\">extraordinary encomium</a> from New York Times columnist David Brooks, of all people:</p> <blockquote> <p>It is easy to sketch out a scenario in which [Obama] could be a great president. He would be untroubled by self-destructive demons or indiscipline. With that cool manner, he would see reality unfiltered. He could gather - already has gathered - some of the smartest minds in public policy, and, untroubled by intellectual insecurity, he could give them free rein. Though he is young, it is easy to imagine him at the cabinet table, leading a subtle discussion of some long-term problem.</p> </blockquote> <p>When a leading Republican columnist is able to write so enthusiastically about a liberal Democratic presidential candidate, you know it's not just that the Republican candidate has failed to get his point across, but that the Democrat has stolen some serious Republican thunder.</p> <p>Just looking at the electoral map tells you that Obama is either competitive or winning states where the Democrats have historically struggled to succeed: Missouri, North Carolina, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Virginia, New Hampshire, Nevada, North Dakota. The map at <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/maps/obama_vs_mccain/#data\">Real Clear Politics</a> has Obama already winning or leaning in states that would give him 286 electoral votes - 16 more than necessary to win. Another 97 votes are in toss-up states. If Obama gets half of these votes the election will be an absolute rout.</p> <p>So the question becomes: are Republicans only renouncing their candidate and the last eight disastrous years, or has Obama really connected with moderate Republicans and independents in the same way that Ronald Reagan did with hawkish Democrats during his years in office? In addition, have events merely spiraled out of control for the Republicans and in favour of the Democrats with the economic crisis or is Obama's political platform and strategy genuinely appealing to some Republicans? The answer is, I think, a little of both.</p> <p>When I have written before urging Obama to govern from the centre, readers have objected, saying that it is necessary to eradicate all vestiges of previous harmful Republican policies, and that doing so requires a wholesale housecleaning. I'm not so sure. Certainly, the damage must be undone and there will be enough of a Democratic majority in both Houses to do so. But if Democrats govern as George Bush, Dick Cheney and Tom DeLay did, using scorched-earth policies, then they will only be setting themselves up for the same fall the Republicans took in 2006 and are likely to take again this year.</p> <p>A lasting governing majority for Democrats requires co-opting the Republican moderates and drawing in independents. The key to Bill Clinton's success was in doing precisely this. If we learned any lesson from the 2000 election and its aftermath it is that a \"my way or the highway\" approach to governing doesn't work in the long or even medium run.</p>",
  "<p>If Barack Obama wins the presidential election, at least part of the reason will be that John McCain failed to recognise a landmark cultural shift.</p> <p>The one-time bipartisan moderate cast his lot with the Republican party's hard right just as it was <a href=\"http://www.gazette.com/common/sections/?ucgid=wap_article/&amp;id=37766\">losing influence</a>. Rather than battling for independents and conservative Democrats, McCain chose instead to excite the passions of his party's narrowest constituency. In so doing, he ended up running not just against Obama, but against his own history of bipartisan outreach.</p> <p>I do not intend to write McCain's political obituary. Though Obama <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/us/general_election_mccain_vs_obama-225.html\">leads in many polls</a> by a substantial margin today, the election is still nearly two weeks away. A lot could happen between now and then.</p> <p>But assuming McCain really does go on to lose, there are three major blunders he made that arise from his attempt to connect with the right's sense of resentment and us-against-them populism: his war against the news media, with whom he had long been so friendly that he once jokingly called them \"<a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/look-mccains-08-media-strategy/story.aspx?guid=%7B6BAB8A05-5CFD-4E12-A6BA-0908901EDF0E%7D\">my base</a>\"; his inexplicable choice of Sarah Palin as his running mate and his deeply personal attacks against Barack Obama. </p> <p>Let me take them one at a time.</p> <p>1. McCain and the media. In 2000 McCain nearly upset George Bush's march to the nomination by inviting reporters aboard the <a href=\"http://bostonphoenix.com/archive/features/00/02/17/DON_T_QUOTE_ME.html\">Straight Talk Express</a> and charming them with anecdotes and access. In 2008 he didn't even give the press a chance, <a href=\"http://69.25.198.13/Boston/News/68093-Beating-the-press/\">trashing it</a> on the assumption that it would be in the tank for Obama - and possibly in the hopes that he might be able to tap into the anti-media anger of Hillary Clinton supporters.</p> <p>Perhaps the paradigmatic moment was McCain's <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1836909,00.html\">bizarre August interview</a> with Time magazine, in which he answered standard-issue questions with undisguised hostility and contempt. No doubt this played well with the right, which has long detested what it sees as an elite liberal media. What McCain seems to have missed is that even if reporters, on the whole, favoured Obama, they still liked him, too. By cutting them off, McCain essentially gave them permission to dump on him at will. And many have.</p> <p>2. The Palin pick. The Alaska governor is a talented political performer, and McCain's choice worked for about two weeks. But among her numerous deficits as a general-election candidate is the fact that she may be the most extreme religious candidate since <a href=\"http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/scopes/bryanonevol.html\">William Jennings Bryan</a>.</p> <p>At a time when the economy is melting down, and when McCain could have been putting, say, Mitt Romney front and centre as an experienced businessman and financial manager, we were learning that Palin had once prayed that <a href=\"http://medianation.blogspot.com/2008/09/teasing-out-palins-religious-views.html\">God would build a natural-gas pipeline</a> - and had stood by while the minister of her former church spoke of God's special plans for Alaska in a post-Apocalypse world.</p> <p>You think this is what the <a href=\"http://www.onthemedia.org/transcripts/2008/10/17/03\">folks wielding those people metres on CNN</a> are looking for? Think again.</p> <p>3. Getting personal. Attacks on an opponent's policies are fine. Even attacks that stretch the truth are hardly cause for consternation. But McCain has gone after Obama in the most vile terms imaginable.</p> <p>There are many examples from which to choose. I'll pick two.</p> <p>The first was McCain's claim, earlier in the campaign, that Obama would rather \"<a href=\"http://time-blog.com/swampland/2008/07/mccain_meltdown.html\">would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign</a>\". By characterising Obama as deeply unpatriotic, and perhaps even treasonous, McCain played directly into unstated fears about a black candidate with a Muslim-sounding name.</p> <p>The second was a McCain ad about Obama's support as an Illinois legislator for a sex-education bill that would have taught kindergarteners how to ward off predators. Except that's not what the ad said. Instead, it claimed that the bill would have mandated \"comprehensive sex education\" for kindergarten pupils - <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2008/sep/11/kindergarten-sex-ed-hardly/\">as sleazy a lie</a> as has ever appeared in a major-party candidate's advertisements.</p> <p>Trouble is, the truism that negative campaigning works didn't seem to hold this time. It may have energised the <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=lPg0VCg4AEQ\">sorts of people who turn out at Palin rallies</a>, but it appeared to turn off the undecided moderates who will actually choose the next president.</p> <p>What happened to McCain would be sad if he hadn't done it to himself. You'll sometimes hear an old defender of his try to claim that McCain is better than his campaign. Nonsense. There is no such thing as a candidate who is better than his campaign.</p> <p>It could be that victory was never a realistic possibility for McCain following eight years of an unpopular Republican president and an economic crisis.

  "<p>He is renowned for his long hours, hectic schedule and workaholic habits but the stress of high office may be taking its toll on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran\">Iran</a>'s president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and jeopardising his political future.</p> <p>Speculation about the hyperactive leader's health was prompted this week after a keynote speech to the state statistics and planning body was cancelled at the last minute and a cabinet meeting took place without him. A speech to a martyr's commemoration event was also called off. A senior aide, Amir Mansour Borghei, told journalists the president was \"indisposed\".<br>It has triggered rumours that Ahmadinejad, 52, is suffering from a long-term illness that may stop him running for re-election next year.</p> <p>Shahab, the Iranian news website, reported that this week's events were the latest in a series of cancellations and said the president had previously pulled out of engagements because of listlessness caused by low blood pressure.</p> <p>In May Ahmadinejad pulled out of events in three consecutive weeks, including a high-profile rally in Golestan province where he was due to meet voters face-to-face. Aides said he had an overcrowded schedule.</p> <p>Citing \"sources close to the government\", Shahab said doctors had advised the president to cut his workload to reduce the possibility of illness. There is little sign he has heeded any such advice: yesterday's cancellation came after Ahmadinejad had returned to Tehran from a visit to the Asalouyeh oil and gas project in southern Iran.</p> <p>The reports will be a blow to the pride of a leader who revels in his energetic style and is known for micro-managing government affairs.</p> <p>They come at a time when Ahmadinejad is wrestling with acute political problems including near 30% inflation, rising unemployment, plummeting global oil prices, a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/21/iran-middleeast-ahmadinejad-bazaaris\">market trader strike</a> over plans to impose VAT and demands for the resignation of his interior minister, Ali Kordan, for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/aug/13/ali.kordan.oxford\">falsely telling MPs he had an Oxford University degree</a>.</p> <p>More worrying is that the rumours appear to have given Ahmadinejad's critics a new stick to beat him with. Fellow hardliners in Iran's so-called principalist, or fundamentalist, camp are calling for the president to withdraw from the forthcoming presidential election unless doubts over his health are cleared up.</p> <p>Issa Saharkhiz, an Iranian political analyst, said the reports could have been fanned by opponents, including the Tehran mayor, Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, who are preparing to run against the president. \"I'm not sure if these health problems are permanent or just a result of tiredness,\" Saharkhiz told the Guardian. \"But some groups, mainly moderate conservatives, may be thinking that they have found a political solution for eliminating him from the nomination for the elections.\"</p> <p>It is not the first time an Iranian political leader has been the subject of health speculation. Rumours have circulated for some time about the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is believed to have been treated for prostate cancer. Unfounded reports last year suggested he had died.</p>",
  "<p>A top Iranian official has said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> is the favoured candidate of Tehran, calling him more \"rational\" than John McCain in remarks that could be used against the Democratic US presidential hopeful.</p> <p>Ali Larijani, the speaker of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran\">Iranian</a> parliament, told reporters yesterday his government was \"leaning more in favour of Barack Obama because he is more flexible and rational, even though we know American policy [towards Iran] will not change that much\".</p> <p>Larijani, an ally of Ayatollah Ali Khameini, the supreme Iranian leader, served until last year as his country's chief negotiator in talks to dismantle Tehran's nuclear programme. With the Iranian election looming next year, he is considered a potential opponent of the president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.</p> <p>Larijani's remarks could provide ammunition for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">McCain campaign</a> to attack Obama before Americans go to the polls on November 4. </p> <p>Republicans often condemn Obama for signalling he would conduct diplomacy with Iran without setting conditions in advance. The notion that Tehran prefers the Democrat could bolster McCain's case for tough talk against the regime.</p> <p>Before Obama claimed his party's nomination, Republicans were already playing up a positive review from a senior political adviser to Hamas. Potential <a href=\"\u00ee\" http: www.huffingtonpost.com 2008 04 18 mccain-hamas-endorsement_n_97469.html\u00ee>McCain donors received emails</a> quoting the Palestinian militant group's rave review: \"We like Mr Obama and hope he will win the election.\"</p> <p>Obama received his own compelling attack material this week, courtesy of al-Hesbah, a website supportive of al-Qaida, which named the \"impetuous\" McCain as its preferred presidential candidate.</p> <p>\"Al-Qaida will have to support McCain in the coming election,\" a commentary posted this week on al-Hesbah said, adding that the Republican would follow the \"failing march of his predecessor\", George W Bush.</p> <p>As well as commenting on Iran's view of the US elections, Larijani dismissed the likelihood of a US attack on Iran.</p> <p>\"The risk was low before,\" he told journalists in Bahrain. \"But now I am 100% certain that the United States will not unleash a war against Iran. The economic crisis has cost the United States $1.4tn and Washington is working to resolve its internal problems and not a war.\"</p>",
  "<p>A Lake county, Indiana, superior court judge yesterday ordered early voting sites in heavily Democratic cities Hammond, Gary and East Chicago to remain open in a decision that could affect the presidential election in the battleground state.</p> <p>In her decision, Judge Diane Kavadias Schneider dismissed complaints from local Republican officials trying to block the sites on the grounds they violated local election rules and created a risk for voter fraud.</p> <p>Since local Republicans first sought to close the sites two weeks ago, the case has drawn attention from the presidential campaigns of both John McCain and Barack Obama because Indiana is a swing state.</p> <p>\"This is one of a dozen-plus legal actions that our campaign is paying attention to,\" said Ben Porritt, a spokesman for the McCain-Palin campaign. \"Most importantly, the goal of our campaign is to ensure that all eligible voters have an opportunity to vote, and their votes be counted. We obviously back early polling locations, as long as they are done according to state law. While we disagree with this decision, we will continue to monitor any further legal action that takes place.\"</p> <p>Yesterday's ruling was hailed by Democrats because it means more voters in a heavily Democratic region of Indiana have easier access to the polls. In the past, voters had to go to Crown Point, roughly 24 miles (38.6 kilometres) away from East Chicago, to cast early ballots.</p> <p>\"Early voting has been a great success so far in Lake county. Thanks to Judge Kavadias Schneider's ruling today, thousands of Indiana voters had their rights protected and the opportunity granted to take part in early voting,\" said Jonathan Swain, the Indiana spokesman for Obama's campaign. </p> <p>\"No matter which candidate or which party they are voting for, all Hoosiers who are eligible to vote deserve the right to have their voices heard in this critical election.\"</p> <p>Schneider was appointed by the Indiana supreme court to preside over the case brought by John B Curley, chairman of the Lake County Indiana Republican Central Committee, and Jim B Brown, a member of the Lake county board of elections, and others.</p> <p>The plaintiffs alleged that early voting sites in the three cities should not have been opened because there was no unanimous vote by the Lake county board of elections approving the locations.</p> <p>Attorneys from the other side said no unanimous vote was needed by the election board because the three locations - one in each city - are in government offices and not \"satellite\" voting sites. The election board must give unanimous approval for a satellite voting site. Closing the sites would disenfranchise poor and minority voters, the same attorneys said.</p> <p>\"The decision is a complete victory for voters,\" said Jonathan Weissglass, an attorney who represented some of the groups fighting to keep the sites open. \"People in Gary, Hammond and East Chicago: it's very difficult for them to get to Crown Point. There's not good public transportation. People don't have cars or time to make a trip to Crown Point.\"</p> <p>R Lawrence Steele, an attorney representing the plaintiffs, was not available for comment on yesterday.</p>",
  "<p>The outgoing GMG Radio chief executive, John Myers, said the future of digital audio broadcasting - DAB - radio would be decided over the \"critical\" next six months.</p> <p>Myers will step down next April after 10 years in charge of GMG Radio, but will continue as a consultant to the group on issues including DAB.</p> <p>He said Channel 4's involvement in DAB, which came to an abrupt halt two weeks ago before any of its planned digital stations had launched, had been like the \"emperor's new clothes\".</p> <p>\"Everyone knew it wasn't going to happen except Channel 4,\" Myers told MediaGuardian.co.uk.</p> <p>\"I always said there was more chance of me losing 10 stone than Channel 4 launching, and I still think there is more chance of me losing 10 stone,\" he said.</p> <p>\"They got into it for the right reasons, and I applaud them for that, but they probably hung on for grim death too long after the game was up. But it doesn't mean to say that DAB is dead.\"</p> <p>Myers said the next six months would be crucial for DAB, which accounted for 18.7% of all radio listening in the third quarter of this year, according to the latest Rajar figures.</p> <p>However, commercial radio has still struggled to make DAB pay, with Channel 4's withdrawal effectively sounding the death knell for a new wave of stations due to launch on the second national commercial digital radio multiplex.</p> <p>\"The next six months are going to be incredibly important in terms of deciding the digital future and the platform for the future of radio. We are at a critical stage,\" said Myers.</p> <p>\"Radio is going to become more and more brand led, and there is going to be more consolidation when the time is right.\"</p> <p>Myers also said that regulator Ofcom should adopt a lighter touch \"so radio stations can adapt more quickly without having to go cap in hand to the regulator all the time\".</p> <p>\"We have to find a way through this hugely complicated digital maze. There are so many different conflicting influences, whether [transmitter business] Arqiva, Ofcom, the Department for Culture Media and Sport, the local, regional and national commercial networks, and the BBC,\" he added.</p> <p>\"There has to be a rethink about how DAB is going to work. It is a hugely complicated process but I am confident we can find one.</p> <p>\"Commercial radio has spent over \u00a3100m on DAB so far, so there's a lot of love in the room and desire to make it happen.\"</p> <p>Myers was recruited by former Guardian Media Group chief executive Bob Phillis after he spotted him on BBC documentary series, Trouble At The Top, which chronicled Myers' launch of Border TV's Century Radio in Manchester.</p> <p>When he joined GMG Radio in 1998 its only major asset was a minority shareholding in Jazz FM. </p> <p>GMG Radio won its first licence in Wales in 1999, launching Real Radio in 2000. </p> <p>The company's business now comprises the Smooth, Real and Rock Radio brands, as well as the Century stations that GMG Radio bought in 2006.</p> <p>GMG Radio is part of the Guardian Media Group, which also publishes MediaGuardian.co.uk.</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>Sarah Palin wants a shot at the top. I don't mean Palin for Pres 2008. I mean 2012. She's been tacking hard to the right, amping up her fiery evangelical credibility factor, paying homage to those that would back a reaction candidate against a first-term Obama administration, and drawing differences between herself and her flagging running mate. <br> Palin has taken her evangelical pandering a step further, calling in to James Dobson's radio program and gushing to the host. The founder of conservative religious nonprofit <a href=\"http://www.focusonthefamily.com/\">Focus on the Family</a>, Dobson is a key player in the evangelical movement who way back in January vowed not to support McCain \u2013 a man he didn't feel was true enough to the Christian cause. He was brought back around to the ticket when Governor Palin came on board. David Brody, senior correspondent for the Christian Broadcasting Network, called Sarah Palin's talk yesterday with Dobson the Evangelical's <a href=\" http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/469071.aspx\"> \"Caching\"</a> moment. \"I can feel the power of prayer and that strength that is provided through our prayer warriors across this nation and I so appreciate it,\" Governor Palin told Dobson:</p> <blockquote> <p>Dr Dobson you have been on the forefront of all of this, on all of this good for so many years and your reward is going to be in heaven because I know that you take a lot of shots also but please know that on our end as kind of outsiders looking in at what you have accomplished all these years, if it were not for you so many of us would be missing the boat in terms of hearing the message and understanding what it is that we can do to further the cause of life and of ethics in our nation, those things that we should be engaged in. We owe so much to you.</p> </blockquote> <p>It wasn't Palin's first pitch to the evangelicals of late. Panicked by their deteriorating poll numbers, the McCain campaign has clearly given her free range to pander to her natural constituency, hoping to flush those voters to the polls in 12 days. The big forgotten news of the weekend was Palin's visit to the <a href=\" http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/467179.aspx \">Christian Broadcasting Network</a>. For those who can't guess from the name \u2013 CBN is exactly what it sounds like: Christian news for Americans who want their news filtered through a primarily evangelical light.</p> <p>Asked about her support for a <a href=\" http://usgovinfo.about.com/cs/usconstitution/a/marriage.htm \">federal constitutional amendment</a> making marriage a union between \"one man\" and \"one woman\", Palin threw her full support behind the ban, despite McCain's softer position and her own position on abortion, which is that states should decide on the issue. <a href=\" http://blog.newsweek.com/blogs/stumper/archive/2008/10/22/is-palin-making-plans.aspx \">Newsweek</a> points out today a list of other ways Palin has pushed herself away from McCain.<br> Moving away from her ticket, Palin explained her position. \"In my own state, I have voted along with the vast majority of Alaskans who had the opportunity to vote to amend our constitution defining marriage as between one man and one woman,\" Palin said. \"I wish on a federal level that that's where we would go because I don't support gay marriage. I'm not going to be out there judging individuals, sitting in a seat of judgment telling what they can and can't do, should and should not do, but I certainly can express my own opinion here and take actions that I believe would be best for traditional marriage and that's casting my votes and speaking up for traditional marriage that, that instrument that it's the foundation of our society is that strong family and that's based on that traditional definition of marriage, so I do support that.\" Was this to reassure those who were confused by her quasi-gay friendly comments during her VP debate? She looked so uncomfortable that night, backed into a corner that would have required her either to really articulate a position that gives gay men and lesbians second class citizenship, and thus turn off the majority of Americans, or turn away from the evangelicals she is trying to shore up both for November 4, 2008 and for the 2012 primaries. </p> <p>Younger evangelicals actually aren't nearly as rabidly bigoted about their gay neighbours as their elders are. But older evangelicals have made this a bread and butter issue for the last five years. The entire premise is nasty \u2013 an effort to turn back all those changes creeping across the country by overriding them. That means the recent decision in <a href=\" http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=77b29893-d8b0-4730-9bee-1bf936680b9a\">Connecticut</a> would be rendered as null and void as Mayor Gavin Newsom's efforts in San Francisco some years back before California went the way of Massachusetts. (Those Californian advances are also peril, if the insidious <a href=\" http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php?title=California_Proposition_8_(2008)\">Proposition 8</a> passes on November 4.)<br> For a pol who likes the press as much as she doesn't, these \"spontaneous\" chats with the Christian journalists of America read like a run to the hard right of Obama \u2013 in 2012 as much as 2008. Let's hope the hoopla around her suddenly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/oct/22/sarah-palin-clothes-cost\">pricey clothing</a> habits ends that dream now.</p>",

I'm healthy, happy, I've had five kids, that's going to be in the medical records.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/republicans\">Republicans</a> had previously hinted that Palin, who gave birth to her fifth child this year at the age of 44, would not open her personal files. McCain, as well as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a> on the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/democrats\">Democratic</a> ticket, have all revealed at least portions of their medical history.</p> <p>Palin used the phrase \"if they're released\" at the end of her reply to Williams, giving her campaign room to reverse course on the records despite the candidate's agreement.</p> <p>The NBC interview seemed to indicate tension between McCain and his running mate. In the clips shown last night, the Republican nominee appears reluctant to look directly at Palin, whose expensive wardrobe has set off a flood of negative press.</p> <p>Chuck Todd, the NBC political director, remarked on the \"odd body language\" between the pair and wondered on the air if McCain is \"starting to blame her for things? Blaming himself? Is she blaming him?\".</p> <p>\"I couldn't see chemistry with John McCain and Sarah Palin,\" Todd continued. \"I felt as if we could have grabbed two people and said 'Here, sit next to each other, we're going to conduct an interview'.\"</p> <p>A Washington Post/ABC news poll released yesterday found 52% of voters believed Palin's presence on the Republican ticket reflected negatively on McCain's judgment.</p> <p>While some national polls this week have shown McCain closing the gap with Obama, the Democrat maintains a healthy lead in most swing states 12 days before the election.</p>",
  "<p>I don't like the phone. As well as being a carrier of any number of potentially disfiguring diseases, it encourages yapping; pointless extended conversation in which no detail is too inconsequential to expound upon at obscene length. God, I hate the phone. The only thing I use it for is to make multiple entries in TV quizzes.</p> <p>This is why I am in favour of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robocall\">robocalls</a>. Actually it's not the only reason, I like the name too; I think more soulless automated functions should have the prefix \"robo\" applied to them \u2013 things robotoothbrush, robocarparkbarrier and, in my case, <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=robosex\">robosex</a>. It makes it sound like we're in the future, already. But I believe in the principle too, it makes a lot of sense.</p> <p>Which is why some of the furore over in the United S of A this week has gone in one eye and out the other. So John McCain has been using robocalls, recorded messages that, when picked up, bluntly articulate a Republican position before disconnecting. Those messages have upset Colin Powell, who <a href=\"http://www.asiantribune.com/?q=node/13800\">cited them</a> as one of the reasons for his endorsing Obama. They've also upset Sarah Palin, who's <a href=\"http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/10/20/1572424.aspx\">decried them</a> as inimical to Thoreau's ideal of the engaged citizen (pretty much). The Obama campaign, meanwhile, is so upset by McCain's robocalls that they've been forced to condemn his tactics, <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-10-22-robocalls_N.htm\">in their own series of robocalls</a>. </p> <p>All this controversy has made me want my own robophone. Or, more specifically, I'm hoping that my mum might buy me one. Times are tight, after all, and it would be in my engagements with her that the device would come in most handy. Each week I am expected to call home to inform my dearest relatives as to my wellbeing, professional standing (it does vary that much) and whether I am coming home for Christmas (a topic for discussion even in April). In return I have to spend half an hour hearing about the machinations of my parents' neighbours and their ongoing attempts to breed a monster strain of <a href=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1131/988751081_af5c3b6a67.jpg\">leylandii</a>. With one simple, automated message I could render the whole thing meaningless.</p> <p>It needn't stop there of course. I could save my favourite order so Peaceable Pizzas (they're organic) receive it at exactly the same time every other night. On alternate days, I could do the same with the local Indian. I could lessen the prospect of the office sussing that I wasn't actually missing work because I had typhoid, by denying me the opportunity to talk to me about it. And, of course, I could set up a religion and advertise it through late-night unsolicited phonecalls. After all, there's no room for <a href=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1131/988751081_af5c3b6a67.jpg\">posters on the bus</a> any more.</p> <p>Anyone who followed Homer Simpson's brief career as the <a href=\"http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Lisa's_Date_With_Density\">Happy Dude</a> will know that robocalls only end in tears. (Interestingly, the device Homer uses in this 1996 episode to solicit a dollar from every resident of Springfield is called an autodialler; that we have upgraded from auto to robo in the past 12 years shows how far we have come). But I'm willing to endure the consequences in return for the brief period of control and freedom that robocalling would bring. If anyone could recommend a good make of dialler, I'd be very grateful.</p>",

  "<p>Sarah Palin has provided some of the best sub-plots to the extraordinary soap opera that has been Campaign 2008 \u2013 including the latest flap about the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/21/rnc-has-spent-over-150000_n_136736.html\">cost of her costume</a> and, coming soon, the <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27328630/from/ET/\">release of her medical records</a> \u2013 but there is none more intriguing than the question that could be left hanging when the saga officially concludes on November 5: what happens to Palin next?</p> <p>Of course, if John McCain wins she'll become the vice-president of the United States \u2013 where she would doubtless continue getting feverish media attention from now till 2012. But what if he, and therefore she, loses?</p> <p>On this, there are two camps. The first says Palin will slink back to Alaska and obscurity, her reputation trashed for ever by the clear evidence that she served to <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/22/poll-palin-a-bigger-drag_n_136794.html\">drag down the Republican ticket</a>. Palin's most vicious critics go further, predicting that, once back in her home state, she will face a bitter homecoming \u2013 perhaps even impeachment proceedings following the verdict of <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/palin-repimanded-over-abuse-of-power-as-alaska-governor-958120.html\">abuse of power</a> delivered by the independent investigation into the Troopergate affair (a verdict that was unambiguous despite Palin's Orwellian insistence that she was \"cleared\" by the investigation).</p> <p>The other camp, however, sees a much brighter future for Governor Palin \u2013 one focused on the Republican presidential nomination of 2012. In this view, Palin will emerge from 2008 as the frontrunner to be the party's candidate next time around. </p> <p>This seems much more likely to me than a quiet exit from the public stage. After all, the jockeying for 2012 is already under way: indeed, in a signal of collective resignation to defeat on November 4, much of the conservative blogosphere is currently consumed with discussion of the 2012 race and Palin's probable place in it. In a very revealing remark to Rush Limbaugh the other day, Palin herself stoked such talk when she told him she had \"<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2008/10/14/politics/fromtheroad/entry4522067.shtml&quot;\">nothing to lose</a>\" by going hard after Barack Obama \u2013 audibly calculating her own interests, separate from those of the McCain-Palin ticket. </p> <p>Here are just some of the reasons why she would begin out in front. First, whatever the rest of America thinks of her, she has clearly excited the Republican base \u2013 and they are the people who vote in Republican primaries. </p> <p>Second, she has powerful backers among one faction at least of <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/10/27/081027fa_fact_mayer\">the conservative intelligensia</a>, namely the men who marked her out as McCain's VP in the first place. They don't mind her obviously limited curiosity or qualifications: they see a willing vehicle for their own ambitions, a woman who has the single quality that no politician can learn or acquire \u2013 star power. Besides, she can use the next four years to mug up on, you know, facts and things. </p> <p>Third, there will be a wave of anger in a post-defeat Republican party and much of it will be directed at the \"Washington establishment\" types who sided with Barack Obama (from Colin Powell downwards) or at least criticised McCain (such as former Reagan speechwriter Peggy Noonan). Palin will be a perfect receptacle for this anger, because she is the reason so many elite conservatives have broken with McCain. </p> <p>Her chief problem will be visibility. Alaska is very far away: how can she stay in people's minds, especially in the minds of the media, think-tankers and donors who she would need to start building a campaign operation?</p> <p>Here there are two intriguing theories. One suggests she will get her own TV show, surely on Fox News. Would that mean quitting the governorship? Normally, it would but nothing about the Palin candidacy is normal. I could see Fox tearing up the rulebook and having Palin present her own show \u2013 \"Live from Wasilla, it's Sunday morning!\" \u2013 while still in office. </p> <p>Or watch to see what happens to the aged Alaska senator Ted Stevens, now under investigation for corruption. If he returns to the senate, but then has to quit soon afterwards, guess who appoints his successor. That's right, the Governor of Alaska, one Sarah Palin. She could appoint herself, sending herself to Washington to meet everyone she would need to meet. </p> <p>Look, it's impossible to know exactly how she will do it. But something tells me that Sarah Palin is not ready to be a historical footnote. We have not seen the last of her, not by any means. </p>",
  "<h2>Palin's wardrobe: All the rage</h2> <p>Getting elected president of the United States has long been an expensive undertaking, but this year's campaign has broken all records. By the end of the race, the presidential candidates <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/23/barack-obama-john-mccain-fundraising\">will have easily raised $1bn</a> between them, a new report from the Centre for Responsive Politics revealed yesterday, dwarfing the previous record of $880.5m in 2004. </p> <p>In that context, the news that the Republican party had spent more than $150,000 on clothes for Sarah Palin in spending sprees at several upmarket department stores might seem relatively unimportant. But that wasn't how it played. The story <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/22/uselections2008-sarahpalin\">threatens to do serious damage</a> to Palin's image as an anti-elitist \"Joe Six-pack American\". Making things worse, Palin's main personal shopper seems to have been Jeff Larson, a powerful Republican consultant in Minnesota whose firm has been tied to the recent round of negative robocalls purchased by the McCain campaign, Elana Schor writes in the Guardian today.</p> <p>Obama, who leaves the campaign trail today for two days to visit his grandmother in Hawaii, faced problems of his own yesterday. He spent some of it addressing ill-advised comments earlier in the week by Joe Biden, who to Republican delight warned that within six months of Obama taking office, there would be \"an international crisis, a generated crisis, to test the mettle of this guy\". He also began to speak openly and in detail <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/22/barack-obama-transition-team-john-mccain\">about the post-election transition period</a>, opening himself to charges of complacency, Ewen MacAskill writes in today's Guardian. </p> <p>In Virginia, the Democrat met senior national security advisers to discuss the foreign policy challenges ahead, and he welcomed an international summit on the financial crisis planned for November, after the election. But he was at pains not to appear cocky, a charge the Republicans are all too keen to level. \"Even though the election will have taken place and there will be a new president-elect, we are still going to have one president at a time until January 20, until the new president is sworn in,\" he said.</p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>Obama flies to Honolulu today, suspending his campaign trail appearances in order to visit his grandmother, who is seriously ill. McCain is in Florida, Palin is in Ohio and Biden is in North Carolina. In the first part of a joint McCain-Palin interview last night, Palin hinted that the campaign might soon release her medical records; she's the only one of the four candidates to have released nothing at all. The second part of the interview airs today, as does a CBS interview with Obama about his grandmother.</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>A new CNN poll yesterday showed Obama with a lead in a host of formerly red or currently swing states - Nevada, North Carolina, Virginia and Ohio - though McCain leads in West Virginia. A national Fox poll gave Obama a nine-point lead among likely voters, but an incongruous Associated Press poll finds the race almost tied, with Obama at 44% and McCain at 43%.</p> <h2>On theguardian.com now</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/oct/23/us-elections-colorado-sarah-palin\">Video: Road trip, day 11 - Palin power</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/oct/22/uselections2008-sarahpalin\">Tomasky talk: Palin's clothes budget v mine</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2008/sep/19/uselections2008.sarahpalin?picture=337803770\">In pictures: Sarah Palin's fashion sense</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/23/barack-obama-us-assassination-us-elections\">Timothy Garton Ash: Obama shows his mettle</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/audio/2008/oct/23/political-philosophy\">Audio: 'I think only 30-40% of the US population is capable of voting well'</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/deadlineusa/2008/oct/23/uselections2008-colorado-democrats\">Deadline USA: The Democrats get their act together</a></p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2008/10/23/campaign_myths/\">Salon.com: The pundits' seven biggest blunders of the campaign</a><br><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/opinions/2008/10/21/republican-moderate-swing-oped-cx_dg_1022gerstein.html\">Forbes: RIP Reagan revolution</a><br><a href=\"http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/239184.php\">Talking Points Memo: October 22 - the day in 100 seconds</a><br><a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1853025-1,00.html\">Time: Joe Klein - Why Obama is winning</a><br><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/23/opinion/23kristof.html\">New York Times: Rebranding the US</a><br><a href=\"http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/police-prepare-for-unrest-2008-10-21.html\">The Hill: Police prepare for election day unrest</a></p> <h2>Quotes of the day</h2> <p>\"Let's be clear who John McCain is fighting for.

Colorado Springs is definitely what Palin would describe as one of the \"pro-America areas of the nation,\" home to some of its most powerful conservative evangelical institutions. When we arrived at the city's minor league baseball stadium on Monday at 6am for an 8am rally, there were already plenty of Palin's supporters lined up in the pre-dawn darkness, many of them dressed in red to demonstrate fealty to their candidate. </p> <p>Two hours later, they had filled the centre of the 8,500-seat stadium (though there were still empty seats in the stands) and were kept stamping their feet in the damp cold - first to a Christian rock group and then to Hank Williams, Jr, who sang one populist tune after another, some of them tailored to the current election. </p> <p>In the original version of his song, <a href=\"http://www.cowboylyrics.com/lyrics/williams-hank-jr/family-tradition-10115.html\">Family Tradition</a>, Williams defended his hereditary penchant for drinking Jim Beam and smoking dope. But rewritten as \"McCain-Palin Tradition,\" the song encourages voters to ignore the \"leftwing liberal media\" and support the Republican ticket \"cuz they're just like you and ol' Hank\". </p> <p>He goes on to explain the causes of the financial crisis: \"The bankers didn't want to make all those bad loans / But Bill Clinton said 'you got to!' / Now they want to bail out, what I'm talking about / Is a Democrat liberal hoodoo!\" </p> <p>Williams's tribute in song to Sarah Palin compared her to a mama bear\" who could be counted upon to \"protect your family's condition\" because \"If you mess with her cubs, shes gonna take off the gloves, / Thats an American female tradition\". It ended with a musical question to the vice-presidential candidate: \"How can you be so smart and be such a good lookin' dish?\" </p> <p>After Williams exited to the sound of Johnny Cash's Walk the Line, the mama bear herself appeared sporting a red leather jacket, producing a roar from her followers. Palin has pulled back from her riff about Barack Obama not being \"a man who sees America like you and I see America,\" after accusations of coded racism from the media, and shouted death threats againt Obama from her crowds. Now she is instead offering up another American bogeyman: The Red Menace. </p> <p>Obama's tax plan, Palin warned her audience, would drive the country into the socialist camp: \"Obama calls it spreading the wealth,\" she said. \"Now is not the time to experiment with socialism. Distributing the wealth will stifle entrepreneurial spirit.\" </p> <p>In fact, the only person who is promoting any kind of socialism these days isn't Obama but George Bush, who has basically nationalised the banking system - ensuring, at the same time, that his brand of corporate socialism will benefit the rich, while leaving the proletariat to twist in the wind. Nevertheless, Palin's use of the s-word drew a raucous response from the crowd.</p> <p>While the crowd at the rally was totally behind their lady in red, there was nonetheless a sense of something being not quite right among Palin's fans. Beneath the cheers and applause, there was a lingering mood of defeat - a sense that it was all over, and that as much as anything, this was a goodbye rally for the woman who just months ago had so energised social conservatives. </p> <p>Pressing a blue \"Country First\" placard into my hands, a middle-aged woman with intense sparkling eyes told me that she thought there still was a chance - that the polling figures were showing a slight up-tick for McCain. She didn't seem all that convinced herself, but she pointed a finger towards heaven and smiled resolutely. The decision, she said, was in the hands of God. \"But, what if you lose?'' I asked. \"We will just have to wait until he decides,\" she said, again nodding towards heaven. \"That might be a pretty long wait,\" I said. She laughed and agreed.</p>",
  "<p>Republican vice-presidential candidate <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a>'s victory over comedian <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2008/oct/07/saturday.night.live.palin.fey\">Tina Fey</a> has been painful to behold. And Tina Fey had been doing so well, too. Sometimes in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media\">media</a>-political complex, satirists are all-important, and until recently Tina Fey must have been waking up every morning feeling like Superwoman. Her superb impression of Palin on Saturday Night Live has given <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a>'s campaign a vicious punch in the kidneys from which it and he may still not recover. If <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barackobama\">Senator Obama</a> wins, well, Fey deserves an ambassadorship or something.</p> <p>Katie Couric's tough <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbQwAFobQxQ\">one-on-one TV interview</a> with Sarah Palin exposed her ignorance and absurdity but it was Fey's comic turn which hammered the point home, turning Palin into a laughing stock, often by simply <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/quiz/2008/oct/21/sarah-palin-tin-fey-quotes\">repeating what she actually said</a>. It has also propelled Fey herself into the stratosphere, as my colleague <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/edpilkington\">Ed Pilkington</a> says in his <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2008/oct/21/comedy-sarahpalin\">fascinating profile</a>.</p> <p>How incredible to think that this grotesque, reactionary chump was being hailed until recently by various neocon headbangers and cowed mainstreamers as a real contender. And how exquisite it has been to watch clips of Fox News presenters having to grit their teeth and pretend to think that Fey's act is really, really funny. </p> <p>Yet the awful truth is that Palin has successfully neutralised a lot of the damage, and will probably come out even - or actually ahead. And all because America's media liberals are too good-natured, or too pusillanimous to go for the kill. Palin's throat was exposed in front of them, and yet Fey, Alec Baldwin and the whole Saturday Night Live team coyly folded the razor and put it away.</p> <p>Fey's impressions of Palin have been really funny as well as eerily observed, especially her <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVndk47caco\">dual press-conference sketch</a> with Amy Poehler as Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Obviously, the show doesn't want to get in trouble for political bias so close to the election, but surely that double-act - satirising the Democrat and the Republican - was enough to satisfy any critics?</p> <p>Of course, it won't satisfy Palin who has gone into overdrive to show that she is a good sport and that she doesn't mind. Her game-plan is to play along, to get into a big, smothering bear hug with Fey, and <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/Saturday_Night_Live/video/clips/gov-palin-cold-open/773761/\">appear on the show</a> as <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/Saturday_Night_Live/video/clips/update-palin-rap/773781/\">prominently as possible</a>.</p> <p>As Pilkington reports, Palin has affected to be totally cool about the whole thing, and has even claimed that she, Sarah Palin, used to do impressions of Tina Fey! On Halloween, no less. That's right: the proudly provincial Alaskan governor, the hockey-mom outsider, so proudly suspicious of media liberals and big-city smart-alecs, turns out to be so sophisticated, cool and self-aware that she did impressions of Tina Fey. I don't think I have ever heard a politician tell such a big, fat obvious lie in my life.</p> <p>So anyway, SNL put her on the show - an obvious mistake - and ended up going easy on her, as well as massively inflating the brand-price for Palin's own post-election political or media career.</p> <p>I was reminded of a passage in the recent <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/howardbrenton\">Howard Brenton</a> play <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2008/mar/27/theatre3\">Never So Good</a>, which starred Jeremy Irons as Harold Macmillan. The play shows Macmillan's impotent fury at being sent up by Britain's top satirist and insolent young puppy <a href=\"http://larvatus.livejournal.com/66328.html\">Peter Cook</a>. Every night this impertinent wit, apparently unacquainted with the rules of deference, put the boot into his elders and betters in the Beyond the Fringe show in the West End. One night, to show that he was a good sport, Macmillan actually went to the show. There was a buzz as the audience realised who was in the audience, and, inevitably, excited whispers reached the ears of Cook himself in his dressing room - or perhaps Cook only saw Macmillan in his seat once he had got out on stage. He could have gone easy on Macmillan, who after all had laid himself open, but with the genius's splinter of ice in his heart, he unhesitatingly went for the jugular. The audience screamed with laughter as Cook drawled in Macmillan's voice: \"There's nothing I like better than to wander over to a theatre and sit there listening to a group of sappy, urgent, vibrant young satirists with a stupid great grin all over my silly face.\" Furious and humiliated, Macmillan intensely regretted his gamble on going to the theatre. </p> <p>If only Fey could show Cook's icy ruthlessness.</p>",

I am a Democrat.</p> </blockquote> <p>That's been true for years, but in the states that we're visiting on this road trip, we're seeing Democrats out in force. They have been pounding the pavement to register voters, calling up voters in swing states and helping raise money.</p> <p>Aaron Silverstein of <a href=\"http://www.squarestate.net\">Squarestate.net</a> in Colorado said that the difference is night and day from four years ago. He credits Democratic chairman Howard Dean and his <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Dean#50-state_strategy\">50 state strategy.</a> The goal of the strategy isn't just to focus on swing states but to focus on winning elections at every level in every state and remake the electoral map. We'll have to wait until 5 November to see how successful the strategy has been. But Aaron said:</p> <blockquote> <p>It's allowed places like Colorado to move from red (Republican) to purple, until now this week we have more active registered Democrats than active registered Republicans. For the first time, this week we have <a href=\"http://squarestate.net/diary/6864/arapahoe-dems\">more Democrats than Republicans in Arapahoe County</a>, a key suburban swing district in suburban Denver.</p> </blockquote> <p>Barack Obama has inspired Democrats, and the competitive primary not only got people involved but they have remained engaged, Aaron said. Conventional wisdom said that the long, combative, sometimes ugly Democratic nominating process would hard the eventual nominee, but what we've heard both in Nevada and now in Colorado is that the long fight actually rallied Democrats.</p> <p>Obama has almost <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/09/on-road-boulder-colorado.html\">three times as many campaign offices</a> in the state. The polling analysis site <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com\">fivethirtyeight.com</a> took a tour of Colorado, and they spoke to John McCain and Barack Obama <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/09/on-road-denver-colorado.html\">volunteers across the state</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Steph Lindsey, a volunteer in Obama's Denver HQ, respects what she's seen from Republicans and their ground efforts. \"Their machine works really well.\" Then she looked around a full seventh-floor army of volunteers and smiled radiantly.</p> <p>\"It's just that now there's a new machine.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Aaron also believes that blogging communities like Squarestate.net have helped not only bring together Democrats to talk about political issues that are important to them but also build community around those issues. The online organising is also driving offline community building. Aaron works for a group called <a href=\"http://www.democratswork.org/\">Democrats Work</a>, which gets Democrats together for pubic service projects in their communities.</p> <p>John Erhardt, the managing editor of Squarestate.net, organises <a href=\"http://livingliberally.org/drinking/\">Drinking Liberally</a> in the Denver area. It's a happy hour project for people who actively work in politics but also people who are interested in politics and want to meet with like-minded people. The virtual organising is supported by real-world social events, much as Howard Dean's meet-ups brought together his supporters online.</p> <p>Every state we've been in, we've heard stories about a remade Democratic Party. Back in Nevada, Hugh Jackson said that he'd never seen the coordination between the state party, the national party and a presidential campaign as he's seen this year. Hugh recently blogged about the <a href=\"http://www.lasvegasgleaner.com/las_vegas_gleaner/2008/10/to-do.html\">non-stop parade of Democrats</a> coming through Nevada to campaign for Obama.</p> <p>Republicans hope that the organisational efforts of Barack Obama and the Democrats will <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/blogs/barone/2008/10/9/the-race-isnt-necessarily-over-for-barack-obama-and-john-mccain.html\">backfire just as Howard Dean's did in the Iowa caucuses</a> in 2004. Sean Quinn of fivethirtyeight.com doesn't buy the argument and believes that John McCain and the Republicans: \"<a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/10/invitation-to-michael-barone.html\">Wow. They. Are. So. F#$%ed.</a>\"</p>"
