  "<p>There we were on Sunday, my boyfriend, his son and I, crowded on the sofa, eating off our laps like a slightly less jaundiced version of The Simpsons, as we watched British cyclist Nicole Cooke climb the gold medal podium in Beijing. The same rainstorm that had bedevilled Cooke and her rivals as they sped around the 126km road race continued to beat down as she stood there, arms aloft, smile splitting her face, while the British national anthem rang out. She looked exhilarated, ecstatic, entrancing.</p> <p>\"Well,\" I said, taking a bite and leaving a significant pause before putting on my best Patricia Routledge impression, \"she could at least have brushed her hair.\"</p> <p>\"What!\" spluttered my 14-year-old stepson, \"She just completed a 78.5-mile road race, I don't think ...\"</p> <p>\"I was joking,\" I said, shaking my knife and fork at him. \"Joking!\"</p> <p>\"Oh,\" he said.</p> <p>And I was. Not a good joke, hands up. But the reason I'd made the comment was because of its incongruity, its obvious sarcasm - the notion that Cooke should have been thinking about anything except her triumph at that moment was patently ridiculous; the notion that she might be thinking about her looks was faintly offensive (and therein often lies the best comedy, although clearly not in this case). Here was a woman who had just battled against the best in the world, who had raced in quite awe-inspiringly nasty conditions - as she said later, they still had two hours to go when the torrential rain began - who had seemed to slip back in the very last leg, to lose momentum, fall away from the leaders, before powering through with such resilience and vigour over the last 200m, that her win suddenly came to seem inevitable. And, indeed, it was.</p> <p>As we watched her through those last bars of God Save the Queen, I realised that another reason I'd made the comment was that it was so long since I'd seen a woman being celebrated simply for what she'd done, that the image had come as some sort of shock to the system. Here was a woman being venerated for her power rather than her femininity, as a figure of absolute achievement and action and ambition. This wasn't about how Nicole Cooke looked, or what her success could sell, or who she might or might not be sponsored by. This was about Nicole Cooke and her will to win. Nicole Cooke and her toughness. Nicole Cooke's actions in the past few hours, not to mention all the hours of work she had put in during every one of her 25 years.</p> <p>And it wasn't long before another image of British female achievement popped up on my television screen. In the women's 400m freestyle swimming, the upper hand seemed to lie clearly with non-British competitors for most of the race, and in the final length it seemed that US swimmer Katie Hoff was bound to take it. At the last second, the 19-year-old British swimmer Rebecca Adlington pushed her nerve and verve and muscle beyond all expectation and cruised suddenly, shockingly, to a fingertip win. The BBC commentators were astounded. \"How on earth did she get Hoff?\" they said. \"Holy moley!\" And if the excitement of Adlington's win - the first Olympic gold for a British female swimmer in 48 years - wasn't enough, there was also the thrill of her teammate, 21-year-old Joanne Jackson, coming in third. As the two young women bobbed, exhausted, at the end of the swimming pool, taking in their triumph, beaming, hugging each other, tears welling in their eyes, it was another moment in which nothing mattered except their stunning achievement.</p> <p>Watching the swimming, tears pricking in my own eyes, I was confused as to why these images were hitting me so hard. Why did they seem so unusual - even unprecedented? I had seen Olympic events before. God knows I had seen people swim and cycle and ride horses. But at this particular moment, for some reason, these images of women seemed more significant than ever.</p> <p>Of course, Olympic events have always been important to female spectators, partly because we see so little women's sport the rest of the time. As we went to press, the only Team GB competitors to have won medals were women, and yet women's sporting achievements are usually entirely overlooked. A recent report by the Women's Sport and Fitness Foundation (WSFF), Backing a Winner: Unlocking the Potential in Women's Sport, offered a stark range of statistics to this effect, statistics even worse than the biggest feminist-pessimist could ever have imagined. For instance, an analysis of all the national daily newspapers over the course of three days in March found that \"just 2% of articles and 1% of images in the sports pages of national newspapers are devoted to female athletes and women's sports ... Just 1.4% of sports photography featured women; and despite the fact our research only looked at the sports' pages, there were more images of models, footballers' girlfriends, the French president's wife and a nun than of sportswomen.\"</p> <p>The outlook wasn't any better when it came to other media. During the same period in March, Sky allocated just three of its 72 hours of sports programming to women's events. And of the 10 sports internet sites the WSFF reviewed, \"there were 367 links from the front page to articles, but just five links went to female sports (1%). There was not one image of a female athlete on the front page of the top 10 websites. Out of 129 images (both photos and film) - there were four images of women (3%): Sky Sports did have a film of two female sports presenters, a third image was of [former Big Brother contestant] Kate Lawler in her underwear in a marathon photograph shot, and a fourth image was of an advert for women's health.\"</p> <p>In the face of this, the Olympics represents a rare two-week period in which women's events are allocated almost as much coverage as those of their male counterparts. At Athens in 2004, women represented 40.7% of all the athletes who competed, taking part in 45% of all events. There are still a few areas in which women cannot compete - there is no women's ski jumping at the Winter Olympics, for example, and, as Nicole Cooke and fellow British cyclist Victoria Pendleton have pointed out, women can only enter three events at the velodrome, compared with seven events for the male competitors. But, for the most part, the Olympics represents something close to parity. It is a competition in which we can watch women take on a massive range of challenges - from archery to athletics to one of the most compelling events of this Olympics so far, the women's weightlifting.</p> <p>As the years have passed, more and more events have been added to the female competition; in 1998, women's ice hockey joined the roster, in 2002, women's bobsleigh, in 2004, women's wrestling. And audiences seem to pay the same amount of respect to each event, regardless of the sex of those participating. As Harriet Foxwell, head of communications for the WSFF, says, during the Olympics, there is a real \"team ethos, an interest in what the British team is doing as a whole. There isn't a separation between male and female events.\"</p> <p>In this sense the Olympics is quite different to another sport that gives similar weight to male and female coverage: tennis. I enjoy tennis a great deal, but when it comes to coverage of the women's events at Wimbledon, for instance, there seems to be at least as much focus on what the women are wearing, what kind of shape they're in, how they're styling their hair, who's designing their outfits and whether or not they are grunting, as there is on their actual performance. The women at Wimbledon are fantastic athletes - you only had to watch this year's final between Serena and Venus Williams to recognise that - but they are also often objectified to a worrying degre. As Gina Dessalines, co-founder of the website <a href=\"http://www.womensportreport.com\">womensportreport.com</a>, says: \"When you see the camera shots that are taken when the female players are on court, and you compare that with the camera shots when the male players are on court, there's definitely an attitude that they're looking for the feminine shot - those moments when they can zoom in on a woman's legs, for example. And then, in all the tennis coverage, there's the massive interest in fashion. Even the people who are interviewing the women, post-match, will say, 'How are you going to dress for tonight's event?' which is a long way off the point.\"</p> <p>Foxwell agrees. \"What's great with the Olympics is the immediacy of it all - you see the women competing, and then they're on the rostrum straight away, looking incredibly natural, and that's so great to see. When it comes to tennis coverage, there are so many links between the sports and the fashion worlds now - a lot of the promotion around Wimbledon this year concerned parties, for instance, rather than just that specific focus on the sports field.\"</p> <p>The biased nature of the tennis coverage is interesting, and the focus on femininity rather than ferocity is certainly galling, but it has existed in other years too, and has never made the Olympics seem especially more feminist by comparison. In fact, I think, what is making this year's competition so rapturous for women is the contrast of the Olympic coverage with the general media attitude to women over the past four years. The celebrity culture, the reality-show culture, the tendency to venerate women who are presented as airheads, stretches back long before 2004, but it is in the past few years that it has reached its zenith. And it is in the past few years, also, that it has taken its ugliest turn, and we have seen an increasing cultural obsession with women on the verge of a nervous breakdown, women who are clearly in psychological turmoil, in and out of rehab, stumbling along the street, with blood on their face and legs and shoes. The image of women that we have been sold for the past few years has been one in which, at best, we are valued only for our looks. More commonly, it seems, we're represented as broken, bedraggled and bewildered.</p> <p>And it is, most pertinently, against this backdrop that the stars of Beijing 2008 have been performing. Recently our expectations of coverage of women have been lowered, nullified; we have become used to seeing that strange category - celebrity women - pictured constantly, relentlessly, their image before us for no other reason than that they happen to have headed out for a pint of milk with their makeup on skew-whiff. At Beijing we have seen the antithesis of that - we have been treated to the sight of ordinary women reaching extraordinary heights. The women we have been thrilling to aren't in our eyeline because they happen to be the offspring of some 1970s rocker, or because they've bagged a multimillionaire boyfriend. They aren't on screen because they have starved themselves to a size zero - instead, their bodies are a celebration of strength. They are women like Cooke, who grew up in Wick, in the Vale of Glamorgan, and has become the first British cyclist, male or female, to win an Olympic road race. Or like Adlington, from Mansfield, who started swimming at the age of seven at her local swimming pool and says that her motto is to \"have fun, there's no point otherwise\". Or Jackson, who comes from Richmond in North Yorkshire and swims for her local club, Derwentside.</p> <p>These are women whose success is an incredible testament to their strength of will, but also represents something accessible - Cooke has spoken about her memories of getting her first bike, memories which will strike a chord with many a kid, while all those provincial children trotting off to their swimming lessons next weekend can remember the fact that Adlington and Jackson got off to just the same start.</p> <p>Will this Olympics change the way that we see women? It's very early days yet. It has the potential to do so if these notable successes lead to a general increase in the coverage of women's sport, because, as Foxwell notes, visible role models can lead to increased sporting participation, which ultimately can result in increased happiness, confidence and success.</p> <p>Whether this year's event represents a short- or long-term improvement in coverage of women and our achievements or not, we should bask in the next two weeks. Just compare the image of Adlington and Jackson, dressed in their power racing suits, celebrating their success, faces lit up with incredulous joy, with that image of Paris Hilton last week, dressed in a cut-out swimsuit, reclining on a sun lounger, mouthing someone else's words in what was, admittedly, a funny rebuke to John McCain. Straggly hair and all, it's clear which of those images is the most inspiring. Let's take to our sofas and enjoy it.</p> <h2>Claire Tolley profiles six British women to watch out for at the Beijing Olympics</h2> <p><strong>Heather Fell, modern pentathlon, 25</strong></p> <p>Fell was ranked fourth in the world going into the games in a gruelling 12-hour event that combines fencing, shooting, a 200m freestyle swim, showjumping and a 3km run. Her training day starts at 5am with a two-hour swim, followed by running or riding before lunch, then shooting or fencing. She was named the British Olympic Association's \"one to watch\" for 2007 after winning silver at the European championship and is hoping for a podium place after setting personal bests in May this year in the swim and the run. The Devon-based penathlete, who graduated from Brunel University, has put a physiotherapy career on hold in her attempt to win Olympic gold and instead works on Friday afternoons in her local pub to keep her grounded.</p> <p><strong>Sarah Ayton, sailing (yngling class), 28</strong></p> <p>Ayton hopes to win a second gold to add to the Olympic title she won with Sarah Webb and Shirley Robertson in the Athens Olympics in 2004, when their success earned them overnight celebrity and the patronising nickname \"three blondes in a boat\". Now with Ayton at the helm with Webb and new crew member Pippa Wilson, the trio came to Beijing having won back-to-back world championship titles and the test event at the Olympic sailing venue in Qingdao. Ayton, who started sailing at the age of six, is engaged to British windsurfer Nick Dempsey, who won bronze in Athens. The pair, who will marry in October, have agreed that if one of them wins the gold here they will have the right to keep their name. If both win gold, their surnames will be double-barrelled.</p> <p><strong>Debbie Flood, rowing (quadruple sculls), 28</strong></p> <p>Yorkshire-born Flood won silver four years ago in Athens and hopes to go one better this time with her crew of Frances Houghton, Annie Vernon and Katherine Grainger. A devout Christian, she excelled at athletics as a teenager and was selected for the national youth squad at judo, but a chance session on a rowing machine at her father's gym revealed a talent for the sport. After a summer course with Tideway Scullers at Eton College aged 16, she opted to pursue rowing at the highest level. Whatever happens in Beijing, though, she will quit the sport for a year to work full-time in the prison service before returning to train for the 2012 games.</p> <p><strong>Shanaze Reade, cycling (BMX), 19</strong></p> <p>The Crewe teenager is the favourite to win gold when BMX makes its Olympic debut after cruising to victory in this year's world championships. Nicknamed \"Speedy Readey\", she beat all male competitors to become British No 1 in 2006. She made her seniors debut the following year, becoming women's world BMX champion and winning the world team sprint track title with Victoria Pendleton. When deciding what GCSEs to take, she got a phone call. \"My coach rang to say BMX had been introduced to the Olympics. That was it. I'd wanted to be an English teacher but you can go back to college. You can't go back to being an Olympic gold medallist.\"</p> <p><strong>Beth Tweddle, gymnastics (asymmetric bars), 23</strong></p> <p>The South Africa-born gymnast has endured a tough time in the games, missing out on the floor final and struggling into the bars final in eighth place as she recovers from a rib injury. With the final next Monday, however, Tweddle will be hopeful of conjuring a performance to match the quality that made her world and European champion in the discipline two years ago. Beijing will be Tweddle's final Olympics - she is planning a career in physiotherapy when she retires after next year's world championships having combined training six hours a day, six days a week, with studying to complete a sports science degree last summer.</p> <p><strong>Kelly Sotherton, athletics (heptathlon), 31</strong></p> <p>In Athens four years ago, all eyes were on the defending champion, Britain's Denise Lewis, but the surprise medallist was the then 27-year-old Sotherton, ranked only 21st in the world. Moments after winning bronze, Sotherton was in tears after her and Lewis's coach, Charles van Commenee, branded her a wimp for not running quick enough in the 800m to win silver. The tears dried and Sotherton, an outspoken former debt collector, admitted Van Commenee was absolutely right. With the Olympic champion Carolina Kluft deciding not to compete in Beijing, Sotherton knows she has to grasp a last chance for Olympic gold - providing she can overcome her jitters in the javelin.</p>",
  "<p>Ah, the lazy days of summer. Colleagues on holiday, contacts unreachable, not even any sunshine to complain about. But if you are feeling listless and underemployed, spare a little sympathy for the paparazzi of Los Angeles, who are facing calls for legislation to curb their excesses. Or, you know, don't. Happily for the snappers, LA police chief Bill Bratton is on their side, interrupting a recent morning workout to defend the paps to a local TV station. \"If you notice,\" he said, \"since Britney started wearing clothes and behaving, Paris is out of town not bothering anybody any more, thank God, and, evidently, Lindsay Lohan has gone gay, we don't seem to have much of an issue.\" This is the same Chief Bratton who has reportedly been advising Boris Johnson on his crime policy, starting with a zero tolerance approach to minor crimes. Including celebrity bad behaviour? Ooh, delicious prospect.</p> <p>Not everyone is idle, of course. Hot on the heels of Niccol\u00f2 Miliband's shockingly controversial article in this paper last month (\"I still believe we can win the next election\") comes a piece by Ed Balls in yesterday's Independent entitled \"Tests are tools to help children achieve the best\". Miliband, you will recall, sparked a political storm by failing to mention the name of a certain prime minister in his article, widely read as a bid for the party leadership. And looky here. Not a single mention of you know who in Balls's piece either. The schools minister would doubtless make some specious argument about this being a policy-heavy piece on the key stage testing system and nothing to do with the leadership, but he's not fooling us. So \"the current national testing system is not set in stone... there may well be changes\", Mr Balls? I think we all know what you're really saying. </p> <p>My northerly colleague Martin Wainwright's recollection last week of the Skibbereen Eagle's warning to Tsar Nicholas that it was watching him, puts one in mind of the (seemingly apocryphal) accounts of several local papers' reactions to the sinking of the Titanic, perhaps most deliciously the Aberdeen Press and Journal's reputed \"Aberdeenshire Man Drowned at Sea: He was a butcher in Union Street\". Though this tale, alas, is a fiction, it is good to see that newspapers have not lost their eye for the local in a big overseas story. And so to the Belfast News Letter, which yesterday had the exclusive: \"Ulstermen vow to stay in Georgia terror zone\". David McDowell and Gavin Adams, both from the province, are holidaying in Tbilisi, the paper revealed, but are \"not unduly alarmed\" by the fighting. \"We're Ulstermen and we've paid for this holiday and we're going to enjoy it,\" Mr McDowell revealed. Should the airport be closed, \"we have been told ... we should make our way overland through the mountains to Armenia which I think would be a great adventure\". Fingers crossed everyone!</p> <p>Never mind the air pistol shooting and the synchronised weight-thrusting, we at the Diary giddily await the return of the Premiership in just four days' time. But what's this? A midfielder who played for a football team last season and remains under contract will, it transpires, play for them this season. Total number of articles linking Cristiano Ronaldo to a move from Manchester United? 2,061. Was it Noam Chomsky who said that sport exists to distract us from \"the questions that really matter for human life\"?</p> <p>And speaking of things that didn't happen ... though the Press and Journal's headline may be a fiction, we were delighted to spot the following, evidently accurate, Titanic report from the San Francisco Examiner, headlined: \"SF Doctor Not On Ill-Fated Ship\". \"Dr WE Hopkins,\" the paper revealed to a relieved city, \"an eye, ear and throat specialist of San Francisco, was not a passenger on the Titanic.\" Coincidentally, the Diary is aware of a number of others who were also not passengers on the Titanic but who have never, perhaps unjustly, been recognised for their achievement. There may be others. If you did not drown in 1912, have never spotted Madeleine McCann, do not date a Premiership footballer, are not planning to run for president of the US and will not win an Olympic medal, the Diary would love to hear from you.</p>",
  "<p>Pakistan's beleaguered president, Pervez Musharraf, faced a direct challenge from al-Qaida yesterday, after the terrorist group lambasted his record in a video.</p> <p>Ayman al-Zawahiri, al-Qaida's deputy leader, whose voice apparently appeared on the tape, spoke in English and called for an uprising against Musharraf and the Pakistan state, which he said was \"virtually ruled from the American embassy\".</p> <p>The video came as Pakistan's parliament convened yesterday for the start of a special session on impeachment proceedings against Musharraf. The government has not yet released its \"charge sheet\" against the president but al-Qaida spelled out its anger in the video. </p> <p>\"Pervez has insulted and compromised Pakistan's sovereignty by allowing the CIA and FBI to operate freely in Pakistan and arrest, interrogate, torture, deport and detain any person, whether Pakistani or not, for as long as they like, thus turning the Pakistani army and security agencies into hunting dogs in the contemporary crusade,\" said Zawahiri. </p> <p>The al-Qaida leader denounced Musharraf for the crackdown he ordered on Islamabad's radical Red Mosque - an army raid last year resulted in about 100 deaths - and his treatment of the renegade Pakistani nuclear scientist, Dr AQ Khan, who has been under house arrest for four years. </p> <p>The vitriol against Musharraf from extremists demonstrated how dangerous it would be for him to remain in Pakistan after leaving office, where he has heavy security. The authenticity of the recording, delivered to a Pakistani news channel over the weekend, could not be verified. </p> <p>Zawahiri said he was speaking in English to directly appeal to the people of Pakistan, regretting that he did not know Urdu, the national language. </p> <p>There were suggestions in the Pakistani media that the video had been \"cooked up\" by Musharraf's aides to boost public opinion in his favour, just as an al-Qaida video on the eve of the last US presidential election appeared to help George Bush's political standing. </p> <p>Al-Qaida's message was much broader than an attack on Musharraf, with the group calling for a jihad against the Pakistani state, including the government and military. The army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, was singled out as a \"hostile enemy of Islam\". </p> <p>\"The dominant political forces at work in Pakistan today are competing to appease and please the modern-day crusaders in the White House, and are working to destabilise this nuclear-capable nation under the aegis of America,\" said Zawahiri. </p> <p>Musharraf shows no signs of resigning, as many predicted after the ruling coalition announced last week that it would try to impeach him. Parliament would need a two-thirds majority to convict him. </p> <p>The impeachment process could take three weeks. The charges are expected to be based on Musharraf's alleged subversion of the constitution. Yesterday, the assembly of the Punjab, the most powerful province, kicked off with a resolution that declared the president unfit for office, which was passed by 321 to 25 votes. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to battle militants - some linked to al-Qaida - on its north-west border. At least 100 militants and nine paramilitary personnel have died in clashes that began last week in the Bajur region.</p>",
  "<p>The Bush administration yesterday accused the Kremlin of spending months preparing a military invasion of Georgia in an act of \"aggression that must not go unanswered\".</p> <p>The sharp rise in western condemnation of Russia's campaign in the Caucasus underlined the mood of rising panic and alarm as western leaders interrupted their holidays and scrambled to confect a response to the crisis in the Caucasus.</p> <p>Vladimir Putin, the Russian prime minister and former president, who appears to be calling the shots over Georgia, responded furiously to the western criticism.</p> <p>Dick Cheney, the hawkish US vice-president, told President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia that \"Russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the United States.\"</p> <p>John McCain, the Republican presidential contender, issued a robust attack on the Kremlin. </p> <p>\"Russian president Medvedev and prime minister Putin must understand the severe, long-term negative consequences that their government's actions will have for Russia's relationship with the US and Europe,\" he said. </p> <p>\"In the face of Russian aggression, the very existence of independent Georgia - and the survival of its democratically-elected government - are at stake ... Russia is using violence against Georgia to intimidate other neighbours, such as Ukraine, for choosing to associate with the west and adhering to western political and economic values.\"</p> <p>In the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, Matt Bryza of the US state department said Russia had been preparing an invasion for several months. </p> <p>\"We heard statements saying that Russian railroad troops that entered Abkhazia [in Georgia] a couple of months ago were there for a humanitarian mission,\" he said. \"Now we know the truth that these forces were there to rebuild the railway to allow ammunition and other military supplies to aid a Russian invasion.\"</p> <p>Western leaders rushed to try to contain the crisis and to offer to mediate. The French and Swedish foreign ministers, Bernard Kouchner and Carl Bildt, went to Tbilisi where Saakashvili said he unreservedly accepted the French proposal for a ceasefire.</p> <p>France's president, Nicolas Sarkozy, is to go to Moscow and Tbilisi today as current EU president to try to cement a ceasefire and facilitate negotiations.</p> <p>EU foreign ministers are to interrupt their holidays to hold an emergency meeting tomorrow in Brussels where Dmitri Rogozin, Russia's hardline envoy to the western alliance, called for a special Nato-Russia meeting on the crisis.</p> <p>All the signs were that Moscow would press home its overwhelming military superiority in Georgia to destroy strategic targets, infrastructure, and humiliate the small Georgian military before accepting a truce and then trying to dictate the terms of negotiations.</p> <p>Putin scoffed at western \"cynicism\", drew parallels between Saakashvili and Saddam Hussein and accused the Georgians of perpetrating atrocities that should be prosecuted as war crimes.</p> <p>\"They had to hang Saddam Hussein for destroying several Shia villages,\" he said. \"But the current Georgian rulers who in one hour simply wiped 10 Ossetian villages from the face of the earth, the Georgian rulers which used tanks to run over children and the elderly, who threw civilians into cellars and burnt them - they are players that have to be protected.\"</p> <p>The calls for an immediate ceasefire came from Nato, the G-7 grouping of industrial democracies, the EU, and Washington. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, is to meet the Russian president, Dmitri Medvedev, on Friday in Sochi on the Black Sea next to Georgia.</p>",
  "<p>PC John Johnson, who has apparently taken his own life at the age of 52, was one of the best policemen in London. Twice voted Metropolitan Community Policeman of the Year, he consistently refused offers of promotion to remain a true local bobby in Wandsworth, south-west London, where he served for his entire 29-year-long police career. </p> <p>He was the moving force behind the Battersea police ball, which raises more than \u00a350,000 for local charities, the Rotary Club Christmas dinner, where volunteers entertain 400 pensioners in a marquee in Battersea park on Christmas Day, and the Battersea summer scheme, which keeps more than 2,000 young people busy in the summer months. He was involved with the local crime prevention panel, St Mary's church, Battersea, and the Triangle Neighbourhood Association, and was also a school governor. </p> <p>Unusually for a Met policeman, John lived in his patch - in the house next to Lavender Hill police station - and was a familiar figure patrolling on his bike, stopping to talk to some of the thousands of local people he knew or to sort out some trouble. As a member of the Reform Club, he rubbed shoulders with judges and chief constables, but he was happy to stay on the beat in south-west London. As a community copper, he was a long way ahead of his time.</p> <p>Brought up in Vienna, the son of an English mother and an Austrian-born South African father who worked at the British embassy, John was educated at Ardingly College, West Sussex, and spent a year at Brasenose College, Oxford, before joining the police service at 25. Last month, he accompanied me on my stag weekend in the Czech Republic, where he was the life and soul of the party, holding forth about everything from the Bohemian aristocracy to the life of Egon Schiele. A week later, quite unexpectedly, he is believed to have stopped his bike on Battersea bridge and jumped into the river Thames.</p> <p>We may never know what drove him to this - he was said to have been depressed by the recent death of his mother in Cardiff, and by concerns about his health - but we do know that he will be sorely missed by thousands of friends in Battersea.</p>",
  "<p>President Evo Morales is to push for a new constitution to transform Bolivia and increase the power of its indigenous majority after his sweeping victory in Sunday's recall referendum.</p> <p>The radical reformer, a former coca farmer, hopes the landslide will revive his stalled effort to \"refound\" South America's poorest country as a socialist state to benefit the long-neglected indigenous masses in the western highlands. More than 63% of voters ratified the mandate of Morales and his vice-president, Alvaro Garc\u00eda, according to partial unofficial results .</p> <p>The new constitution, if approved, would extend the powers of the central government and allow Morales to run for a second consecutive term in the deeply divided nation.</p> <p>\"What happened today is important, not only for Bolivians but for all Latin Americans,\" Morales told a cheering crowd from the balcony of the presidential palace in La Paz. \"I dedicate this victory to all the revolutionaries in the world.\" </p> <p>However, fierce opposition in Bolivia's relatively prosperous eastern lowlands has stymied much of his ambitious agenda, provoking turmoil and political violence. </p> <p>Eight provincial governors were also subject to recall and two opposition figures were among the three governors who were ousted. But the most powerful opposition governors in Santa Cruz and neighbouring provinces entrenched their positions and declared a fresh mandate to resist what they portrayed as a budding socialist tyranny. </p> <p>Land reform and control of natural gas revenues compound the racially tinged power struggle between La Paz and the restive provinces.</p> <p>In a combative address, Rub\u00e9n Costas, the governor of Santa Cruz, advocated more regional autonomy and rejected a new constitution. Another opposition governor, Manfred Reyes Villa, the prefect of Cochabamba, lost the vote but said he would ignore it because it was illegal.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama's campaign offered fresh examples yesterday of the power of technology to transform electoral politics, unveiling plans to text and email supporters when he decides on his vice-presidential candidate, and to incorporate voters across the country in the proceedings at the Democratic party's convention in Denver at the end of the month.</p> <p>\"Barack Obama is about to make one of the most important decisions of this campaign: choosing a running mate,\" Obama's campaign manager, David Plouffe, told supporters in an email. \"Barack wants you to be the first to know his choice.\" </p> <p>The resort to text and email messaging marks a departure from the usual joint appearance at the party's convention when the presidential nominee announces a running mate. It has deepened speculation that the announcement of Obama's vice-presidential choice could come as early as this week - even though he is on holiday with his family in Hawaii. </p> <p>The experiment in text messaging was just one of a number of innovations laid out by the Obama campaign yesterday. The Democratic national committee also laid out plans to use online chats and video to include more people in the party convention.</p> <p>\"We have plans to include voices ... from across America who have never had the opportunity to participate before,\" said Kathleen Sebelius, the governor of Kansas. \"Each night of the convention will look very different than any convention we have seen in the past.\"</p> <p>The party is sending camera crews across the country who will seek out questions from the public that will be delivered by video at the convention. </p> <p>Organisers are also setting up studios in eight cities - Atlanta; Columbus, Ohio; Detroit; Philadelphia; Raleigh, North Carolina; Denver; Tampa, and Richmond, Virginia - which will allow members of the public to record messages, or to ask questions in real time. </p> <p>Sebelius also gave details of the convention's lineup of speakers, which gives star billing to Obama's wife, Michelle, as well as to Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Organisers have assigned a theme to each night of the convention.

Clinton will get her chance to star on the second night, which will focus on economic issues and healthcare.</p> <p>The third night will maintain some traditions, offering the prime-time speaker's slot to the vice-presidential candidate. But Sebelius said Obama's running mate would share the stage with party veterans.</p> <p>Obama will dominate the fourth and final night of the convention, with a speech at a 75,000-seat football stadium.</p> <p>The harnessing of new technology has been a signature of the Obama campaign, which has used the internet to break all previous fundraising records and to build up a grassroots organising effort across the country.</p> <p>Democrats expect to see the payoff for those efforts in congressional races as well as in the presidential campaign, by putting more regions in contention.</p> <p>Obama's proficiency with online organising contrasts with the Republican party's presidential candidate, John McCain, who has admitted that he does not make much use of the internet and has aides print out his emails. Even so, the Republicans are planning some innovations at their convention in St Paul in the first week of September, with talk of McCain officially accepting the party's nomination in a speech on the banks of the Mississippi. </p> <p>The Obama campaign has not entirely abandoned so-called old media. Obama is to release his third book early next month, containing a collection of key speeches. Much of the material has been prepared by campaign staff, although Obama reportedly wrote the foreword.</p> <p>Aides say the book, Change We Can Believe In: Barack Obama's Plan to Renew America's Promise, is meant as a political souvenir, and envisage an initial print run of 300,000. It is scheduled for release on September 9. An ebook version will be released a day earlier.</p>",
  "<p>Talks to end Zimbabwe's political crisis were bogged down yesterday as Morgan Tsvangirai resisted intense pressure to agree to Robert Mugabe retaining much of his power. </p> <p>A second day of gruelling negotiations broke up last night without agreement and Mugabe gave a downbeat assessment, saying they were not making progress at present but that he hoped differences \"will be overcome\" when the talks resume today. </p> <p>Opposition officials say Mugabe has made few real concessions and has rejected Tsvangirai's claim to be the country's legitimate leader because he won the last credible election, held in March. </p> <p>Tsvangirai agreed to Mugabe remaining in office as a ceremonial president but demanded that political power be shifted to him as an executive prime minister at the head of a coalition cabinet. But the opposition said Mugabe had demanded that the prime minister remain subordinate to the president.</p> <p>\"Zanu-PF is not talking about conceding any real power. They are talking about giving up positions in cabinet but they want to remain in control. These guys aren't serious,\" the opposition official said. </p> <p>\"The differences revolve around who will have power. They're not giving up anything on that. They entered these negotiations solely to give up cosmetic issues.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for the opposition said Tsvangirai came under pressure from South Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki, who is acting as mediator, to allow Mugabe to keep some degree of real power. But the spokesman said the MDC leader argued that would be a betrayal of the voters.</p> <p>\"There is a lot of pressure on Tsvangirai ... People in the party are telling him that he cannot agree to a deal that does not recognise the people's will and democracy. Mugabe ... should not be allowed to keep power just because he terrorised the population into voting for him. </p> <p>\"The pressure for us is coming from the people. They don't want to see some kind of half-hearted change. If we were to do that we would lose credibility. If Morgan takes something cosmetic from Zanu-PF he will lose the support of the Zimbabwean people.\"</p> <p>Hours earlier Mugabe described the talks as \"raising the prospect for an all-inclusive government\" and said only minor obstacles remained to an agreement. He told the annual commemoration to mark the country's liberation war yesterday that Zimbabwe \"is not for sale\" and warned the opposition not to be \"used by enemies\" - usually meant to refer to Britain, which he has accused of destroying Zimbabwe's economy as a punishment for redistributing white-owned farms.</p>",
  "<p>Russia has launched a major \"invasion\" of Georgia and is now in control of half the country after a military operation by air-and-ground forces, Georgian military officials claimed this afternoon.</p> <p>Georgia appealed urgently for international help and said it was planning an all-out defence of the capital, Tbilisi, from Russian attack. It said it had withdrawn its troops as Russian forces surged across the west and centre of the country.</p> <p>Russian tanks and armoured vehicles seized the town of Gori - 36 miles from Tbilisi - at about 5pm local time, after advancing southwards this afternoon from the breakaway republic of South Ossetia, Georgian officials said, smashing the Georgian line in two places.</p> <p>Tonight Saba Tsitsikashvili, a Gori resident and local Georgian journalist, said that Russian troops had occupied the main road on the edge of Gori. The troops were in the north of the city but had not yet moved towards the centre, he said.</p> <p>He told the Guardian: \"They are on the central highway which links the east and west of Georgia. This is the situation. People are leaving their villages. They have been told by policemen to leave their villages and houses. </p> <p>\"It's a very bad situation. People are in panic. Nobody knows what to do. This road where the troops are is about 2kms from the city centre. It's very near. The road is closed now.\"</p> <p>At the same time Russian troops were moving across the west of the country from Georgia's second breakaway republic of Abkhazia, in what appeared to be a significant escalation in the five-day conflict.</p> <p>Georgian military officials said Russian troops had seized the towns of Kutaisy and Senaki and were also planning to move forces to the port town of Porti.</p> <p>\"This is a classical full-scale invasion under the umbrella of peace enforcement,\" Irakli Batkuashvili, the head of Georgia's military planning division told the Guardian tonight. </p> <p>He added grimly: \"This is an occupation.\"</p> <p>\"Half of Georgia is under Russian control. Our aim now is to build up our troops and to create a defensive line in front of Tbilisi. We will fight defending Tbilisi.\"</p> <p>The pace of the Russian attack appears to have caught Georgia's vastly inferior armed forces by surprise. Russia had previously insisted it had no intention of moving beyond the existing conflict zone in South Ossetia - briefly captured and then abandoned by Georgian forces.</p> <p>Amid a day of claims and counter-claims, a senior Russian general had said there were no plans to move its troops deeper into Georgian territory. Russian officials denied that Gori had been occupied and Georgian assertions that it had fallen to Russian forces were disputed by some witnesses, who said they saw no troops in the deserted town. </p> <p>The Georgian president, Mikhail Saaskashvili, visited Gori earlier in the day, before being bundled away by his security staff.</p> <p>Georgia has asked for a ceasefire but Moscow has refused, arguing Georgian troops are still fighting in South Ossetia. Tblisi said up to 50 Russian bombers attacked its territory overnight, with one Russian bomb reported to have landed near the civilian airport of Tblisi, shortly after the French foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, had touched down.</p> <p>News of the latest fighting came as Britain condemned the Russian attacks as \"deplorable\". Gordon Brown called on Russia to accept Georgia's offer of a ceasefire, saying Russian military action threatened regional stability and could damage Moscow's ties with other countries.</p> <p>\"There is no justification for continued Russian military action in Georgia, which threatens the stability of the entire region and risks a humanitarian catastrophe,\" the prime minister said in a statement. \"There is an immediate and pressing need to end the fighting and disengage all military forces in South Ossetia.</p> <p>Nato's secretary general, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, joined the US president, George Bush, in criticising Russia for \"disproportionate\" use of force. Nato said in April that Georgia would one day be a member of the alliance.</p> <p>Bush told a US sports broadcaster in Beijing, where he was watching the Olympics, that he had spoken firmly to the Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin. \"We strongly condemn bombing outside of South Ossetia.\" Moscow has justified strengthening up forces in Abkhazia as an attempt to prevent what it called Georgia's \"genocide\" in South Ossetia's capital, Tskhinvali.</p> <p>Putin in turn criticised the US for flying 2,000 Georgian soldiers back from Iraq, where they make up the third-biggest troop contributor after the US and Britain.</p> <p>\"It is a shame that some of our partners are not helping us but, essentially, are hindering us. I mean \u2026 the transfer by the United States of a Georgian contingent in Iraq with military transport planes practically to the conflict zone. The very scale of this cynicism is astonishing - the attempt to turn white into black, black into white and to adeptly portray victims of aggression as aggressors and place the responsibility for the consequences of the aggression on the victims.\"</p> <p>Moscow says 1,600 civilians have been killed in South Ossetia, along with 15 Russian peacekeepers killed and 70 wounded. Saakashvili, told reporters at a press conference this afternoon Russia's attack against Georgia was \"the pre-planned, cold-blooded murder of a small country''.</p> <p>He accused Russia of attempting to occupy the whole country. \"This provocation was aimed at occupying South Ossetia, Abkhazia and then all of Georgia.\"</p> <p>Saakashvili said 90% of Georgian casualties were civilians. \"They are specifically targeting civilian targets. They've been targeting highways in Georgia which are especially crowded at this time of year because of returning holidaymakers,\" he said.</p> <p>Georgia had previously said 80% of casualties were military. Georgia's envoy to the EU, Salome Samadashvili, said the EU must tell Russia to pull back or \" risk their future relationship with the European Union\". EU foreign ministers are expected to meet over the crisis on Wednesday. There are concerns that oil prices, which have fallen in recent weeks, may rise again because of the crisis.</p> <p>Saakashvili told the US vice-president, Dick Cheney, in a phone call that Russian aggression must not go unanswered. Cheney did not spell out what might follow, but threatening to expel Russia from the G8 is one possibility that has been raised in the past by the Republican presidential candidate, John McCain.</p> <p>The Russian ambassador to Nato, Dmitry Rogozin, said Moscow had asked for a meeting with the alliance to explain its actions. Nato ambassadors are meeting tomorrow with Georgia's foreign minister, Ekaterina Tkeshelashvili.<br>The World Food Programme has started distributing food to help displaced people, and has said the number of people needing assistance is \"rising by the hour''.</p>",

  "<p>For more than 200 years, tsars, generals, and politburos in Russia have controlled Georgia. But for the past 17 years since the collapse of the Soviet empire, the small country on the south side of the Caucasus has gingerly embraced a new experience as an independent state - unstable, immature, chaotic, corrupt, but hopeful.</p> <p>Vladimir Putin cannot abide that notion and appears bent on trying to restore a version of the status quo ante.</p> <p>\"Russia has played a positive, stabilising role in the Caucasus for centuries, a guarantor of security, cooperation and progress,\" the Russian prime minister said at the weekend. \"This is how it was in the past and this is how it is going to be in future. Let there be no doubt about this.\"</p> <p>By the time his 58th army, his air force, his spetsnaz paratroopers, and his Black Sea fleet are finished in Georgia, Putin knows where he wants to be. The Georgians, he said, \"will objectively assess their current leaders\" and their \"criminal policies\".</p> <p>In other words, President Mikhail Saakashvili, wayward darling of the west, will either be much diminished or finished. Saakashvili thinks that's the whole point. \"This is not about South Ossetia, this is not even about Abkhazia,\" the Georgian leader said. \"\"It's all about independence and democracy in Georgia. Putin is personally commanding this operation. The purpose is to depose the democratically elected government of Georgia.\"</p> <p>A former Pentagon official long involved with Georgia agrees: \"The strategic objective is regime change. Putin wants a puppet, a satrap. He is playing an extremely good game.\"</p> <p>Georgia is Putin's second war. The first was launched nine years ago, also in August, in neighbouring Chechnya at the beginning of Putin's rule and it entrenched him in power. The current campaign, at the start of President Dmitri Medvedev's term, marks a watershed - the first time the Russians have wielded their guns in anger beyond Russia's borders since the Soviet collapse and the end of the cold war.</p> <p>Putin despised Saakashvili's predecessor, Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet foreign minister and Georgian president, as the man who gave away the Soviet Union. But his contempt for Saakashvili is much more intense.</p> <p>Since the American-educated Georgian led the 2003 Rose Revolution, Putin has striven mightily to subvert Tbilisi - trade boycotts, embargoes on Georgian wine, fruit, and mineral water, deporting thousands of Georgians who run Moscow's vegetable markets, cutting transport links over and through the Caucasus, turning off the oil and gas and stopping the post.</p> <p>It's personal. Saakashvili has been telling western officials and diplomats for months of a looming war and of a foul-mouthed exchange with Putin in April. Last month in Dubrovnik, the Georgian leader told senior US state department officials about the war plans and was warned there could be no military solution to the intricate ethnic conflicts of the Caucasus.</p> <p>Saakashvili blundered. Perhaps he imagined he could pull a fast one in South Ossetia last week, perhaps he walked straight into a Russian trap. The results would be risible if not so tragic. His crack US-trained troops - a tenth of his army - took the Ossetian town of Tskhinvali and managed to hold it for all of three hours before being hammered by the Russians.</p> <p>While George Bush watched baseball in Beijing, Putin created facts on the ground. European leaders rushed back from the beaches and villas of August for an \"emergency meeting\" in Brussels, while McCain and Obama used Georgia to sling mud at one another.</p> <p>Saakashvili, who came to power pledging to recover control of Georgia's breakaway regions, has lost South Ossetia and Abkhazia, probably irretrievably, and will be much weakened.</p> <p>Nicolas Sarkozy of France, in Moscow and Tbilisi today, will grandstand as peacemaker and offer to mediate. The Kremlin will dictate the terms of any negotiations and Putin will probably refuse to accept Saakashvili as a legitimate negotiating partner.</p> <p>There is enough blame to go around. The Russians, the Georgians, the Europeans and the Americans are all responsible for the mess. There is only one victor, Vladimir Putin. If he succeeds in bringing down Saakashvili, it will be a greater victory yet, not only over Georgia, but over the west.</p>",
  "<p>John McCain today suggested that Nato's delay in accepting Georgia to the alliance encouraged Russia to pursue military action against its neighbour, pulling the Caucasus conflict deeper into the US elections.</p> <p>McCain and Democratic rival Barack Obama have traded fire over the crisis in Georgia since hostilities erupted there last week. Obama issued a measured call for restraint on both sides, while the Republican nominee was quick to condemn Russia for its aggression - a response that began to appear prescient as Moscow escalated the conflict.</p> <p>McCain seized on the conflict again today during a campaign stop in Pennsylvania, remarking that Nato's decision to delay Georgian membership in the alliance this year \"might have been viewed as a green light by Russia for its attacks\".</p> <p>\"I urge Nato allies to revisit the decision,\" McCain said. Echoing his past support for removing Russia from the G8, he urged the US to convene an emergency meeting of G7 foreign ministers.</p> <p>The decision to critique Moscow is a risky one for McCain, whose senior foreign policy adviser has profited from lobbying contracts with the Tbilisi government of Mikheil Saakashvili.</p> <p>But the gamble looks to be paying off. When the Obama camp cited McCain's Georgia-connected adviser, Randy Scheunemann, as proof that the candidate is too close to lobbyists, the Republican fired back. </p> <p>McCain accused his opponent of being \"bizarrely in sync with Moscow,\" angering Obama backers who perceived the dig as a subtle invocation of communism. </p> <p>His statement today indirectly jabbed at Obama with a reference to \"Americans wishing to spend August vacationing with their families \u2026 [who] may wonder why their newspapers and television screens are filled with images of war in the small country of Georgia\". Obama is currently on a weeklong holiday in Hawaii.</p> <p>McCain went further than the White House has by proposing a US package of \"immediate economic and humanitarian assistance\" for the Georgian government. Obama has yet to address the prospect of formal US aid to Georgia.</p>",
  "<p>Just the idea that the Zimbabwean tyrant Robert Mugabe will remain in power for even longer is terribly unjust. Yet this is what will happen under <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/11/zimbabwe.economics\">a deal</a> supervised by South African president Thabo Mbeki, between Mugabe's Zanu-PF and the opposition <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_for_Democratic_Change\">Movement for Democratic Change</a> that will be sealed quite soon now. However, the urgency to get the country out of its morass demanded that negotiations take place, no matter how morally repugnant it is to sit down with a man who bears ultimate responsibility for Zimbabwe's crisis. </p> <p>Another flaw of these negotiations is that Zimbabwe's civil society groups, whose feisty opposition helped to push the unwilling Mugabe and Zanu-PF to negotiate with the opposition, have not been included in the talks. The final deal that will be sealed soon between Mugabe and the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) is unlikely to please everyone. The big stumbling block from the beginning was Mugabe's insistence that he should be recognised as the official president and should retain the widespread powers he had enjoyed before. </p> <p>The MDC wanted the presidency to be a largely ceremonial position. The final outcome goes just about halfway: a presidency with downgraded powers. Agreeing to that meant Tsvangirai had implicitly accepted the results of the phoney June 27 presidential election in which there was only candidate: Mugabe. Mugabe has compromised on limiting the powers of the presidency. Tsvangirai has accepted the position as prime minister, with significant powers, but without \"full\" executive control \u2013 which the MDC argued was fair given the fact that it won the internationally accepted March 29 elections. </p> <p>Mugabe had initially insisted on a meaningless vice-president position. Ultimately, in the long term, Tsvangirai \u2013 and ordinary Zimbabweans \u2013 could still win big if he can pin down Mugabe to make parliament the ultimate power-broker in the transitional period. Until now Mugabe has over-ruled parliament. </p> <p>But parliament's role's should be strengthened. The MDC has a parliamentary majority \u2013 and in combination with the other opposition parties, may have an even a larger one. The MDC must insist on parliamentary and civilian oversight over all the security forces. Furthermore, the MDC must push for at least split control of the security departments. </p> <p>Zimbabwe is run by a junta. Tsvangirai and the MDC should insist on running the economy, if not fully, then jointly. But an integral part of the agreements must also be an independent judiciary and electoral commission, with appointments to oversight bodies taken out of the hands of the president. </p> <p>Tsvangirai should insist on bringing in direct democracy through referendums \u2013 which will also bring democracy closer to the people while helping to circumventi personal rule by the president. An agreement that sees power widely dispersed is the only way to make co-governance with the prickly Mugabe and Zanu-PF remotely tolerable. Part of the deal must be to put solid mechanisms in place to stop corruption, human rights abuses and to restore the rule of law, and bring some accountability to the Zimbabwean political system. Ultimately, the best deal for the MDC is to have the transition over as quickly as possible, within less then 30 months, and then go for fresh elections. Mugabe, not surprisingly, insists on a full five-year term. </p> <p>Mugabe has not taken instructions from anyone since taking power. Governing jointly is going to be a bumpy and frustrating one for Tsvangirai. The MDC has negotiated with its hands bound behind its back. Ordinary Zimbabweans are facing the brunt of Zimbabwe's crisis: starvation, human rights abuses, arbitrary violence and homelessness. Mugabe and Zanu-PF do not really care: they are cold-heartedly prepared to sacrifice ordinary people to stay in power. </p> <p>It is a no-win situation: the longer Tsvangirai holds out, the worse it gets for ordinary Zimbabweans. In the midst of the negotiations, the Mugabe regime and its proxies have continued unleashing violence against ordinary Zimbabweans to pressure the MDC negotiators to concede more. But the Mugabe regime is also feeling the heat. Zimbabwe's continuing financial meltdown \u2013 and the possibility of crippling sanctions if there is no satisfactory deal \u2013 means that Mugabe would be running out of hard cash to maintain his opulent lifestyle and his ability to pork-barrel his supporters. Britain and the US could now play a constructive role upon agreement of a deal by giving the money promised (but not given) at independence for land reform, by scrapping some of the country's debts and by providing assistance without conditions, except transparency ones.</p>",
  "<p>A European democracy is under <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2008/aug/10/georgia.russia?picture=336404631\">full-scale attack</a> from Russia, and EU and Nato leaders are either wringing their hands or sitting on them. The continuing conflict in Georgia is not really about the small south-Caucasus country. By opening up a three-front offensive on Georgia, Moscow is deliberately testing Europe's mettle.</p> <p>The broader west \u2013 European countries, the US, Canada and the host of post-1945 international institutions \u2013 are of course also being tested. But Moscow is particularly interested in how Europe's heavyweights will react. In the wake of serious violence and immense geopolitical consequences, however, Britain, France and Germany have done nothing that might be expected of great powers.</p> <p>This is surprising given that with the stationing of its <a href=\"http://en.rian.ru/russia/20080810/115932226.html\">Black Sea fleet</a> and troops preparing for an amphibious landing off Georgia proper, Russia could at any time cut off Europe's strategic oil link to the Caspian Sea. It is perhaps not that surprising that Russian-backed South Ossetian militia chose last week to attack Georgian troops, sparking the conflict we see now. The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline from Azerbaijan's Caspian shore had just been sabotaged by Kurdish rebels in Turkey, and its exports have been rerouted through a pipeline to Georgia's coast. With just one more bold action, Moscow could control Europe's only major energy import route designed to avoid Russia.</p> <p>Mikhail Saakashvili, the Georgian president, has compared the day's events to the Soviet Union's 1956 <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/4/newsid_2739000/2739039.stm\">intervention</a> in Hungary and the 1968 Russian crushing of the \"<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/155500.stm\">Prague Spring</a>\". Russia's 2008 strike against Georgia is in fact very different. Hungary and Czechoslovakia were understood to be within the Soviet Union's agreed area of control, cemented by the cold war's nuclear freeze. Today, Georgia is a fully-independent, sovereign democracy, engaged in a concerted, if bumpy, reform effort to achieve Nato and EU membership. Only Moscow deludes itself that its sphere of influence includes Georgia, a country which has sent troops to Afghanistan and Iraq, which hosts US military trainers, western-oriented energy infrastructure and a western-educated leadership.</p> <p>Russia is a nuclear-armed and increasingly indispensable power. The US and Europe cannot satisfy Georgian calls for material aid against their old cold-war foe. They can, however, take a page out of Moscow's playbook. On his way back from the Olympic opening ceremony in Beijing, Vladimir Putin stopped in Vladikavkaz, in Russian North Ossetia, to lend his support to the war effort. Standing amid <a href=\"http://visualrian.com/images/item/329213\">Ossetian refugees</a> and Russian tank columns, the message he sent was that Russia takes Georgia seriously, while many western policymakers are on holiday.</p> <p>George Bush, Gordon Brown, Angela Merkel and Nicholas Sarkozy should all visit Tbilisi next week. That one action would send a more powerful message to Moscow than any military or diplomatic aid. It would also lead to the immediate end of the conflict. Merely the security needed to ensure their safety would necessitate a ceasefire on the part of Moscow. </p> <p>While this scenario may be unlikely, it is the vein in which western leaders should be thinking. John McCain could revitalise his flagging presidential bid in one fell swoop by standing side by side with Saakashvili, while his competitor relaxes in Hawaii.</p> <p>Such a sign of solidarity would be an effective, but short-term measure. For the long term, Europe must finally get serious about security in its neighbourhood. South Ossetia is just one among several ominous thawing conflicts, in Georgia's <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3261059.stm\">Abkhazia</a>, Azerbaijan's <a href=\"http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/nagorno-karabakh.htm\">Nagorno-Karabakh</a> and Moldova's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transnistria\">Transnistria</a>.</p> <p>All four disputes directly or indirectly involve Russia. The raging conflict sparked in South Ossetia only underscores that each hotspot serves as a tool for Russia to block the region's western integration, to keep strategic energy reserves, trading routes and markets in its \"orbit\". This gives Russia a free hand to divide the EU into Russophobes and Russophiles, energy-dependent and energy-hungry states, countries that receive visits from Vladimir Putin, and countries that receive visits from <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/european_football/article756950.ece\">polonium</a>-wielding agents.</p> <p>Moscow's outdated worldview sees an encroaching west as a threat rather than an opportunity for mutual prosperity. Only through a comprehensive stabilisation initiative for Europe's eastern neighborhood, including high-level European diplomatic engagement, peacekeepers, and economic incentives, can the west effectively convince Moscow that it means business \u2013 in more ways than one.</p> <p>Amid the horrific scenes of violence from Georgia beamed to living rooms around the world, let us attempt for a moment to be serious about this conflict and look at the geopolitical causes and consequences. This is not a Balkan-style ethnic brawl in which all sides share the blame for irrational inhumanity. Russia is using ballistic missiles and strategic bombers against a country one-fortieth its size to finally smash the dream of a Europe whole and free.</p>",
  "<p>As the US elections draw closer, America's unions and employers are battling fiercely over proposed legislation that would shake up the country's labour laws.</p> <p>The unions are spending more than $300m (\u00a3150m) to try to ensure across-the-board November victories for Democrats, which would probably guarantee that the Employee Free Choice Act (EFCA) is passed next year. They believe that the legislation, which is opposed by many organisations including Wal-Mart, would help them to reverse their decades of decline.</p> <p>The EFCA will be an early priority in the new 2009 Congress. Among other changes, it will give new powers to workers who want to unionise. </p> <p>But its supporters face opposition from America's business owners, who have begun a plethora of initiatives to discredit the legislation. The Coalition for a Democratic Workplace, made up of employer-centric organisations such as the US Chamber of Commerce, the Association of Equipment Manufacturers and the Retail Industry Leaders Association, is co-ordinating the effort. In its \"public education campaign\" it has started buying <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNNK98ch8Ec&amp;eurl=http://www.myprivateballot.com/\">TV advertising featuring Sopranos actor Vincent Curatola</a> to bolster Republican candidates.</p> <p>The retail association's biggest member, Wal-Mart, is agitating against the EFCA, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that the company held <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121755649066303381.html\">mandatory meetings for supervisors and managers</a> warning them that a Democratic victory in November and subsequent passage of the EFCA would lead to unionisation and union fees.</p> <p>The company issued a statement denying that it was advocating its workers vote against Democratic candidates but added it did discuss the bill's \"negative impact\" with its employees. Wal-Mart said its stance on the legislation is no secret.</p> <p>Wal-Mart's employee relations activities and anti-union sentiments are legendary in North America and the company once closed a store in Canada rather than let its workers organise. <a href=\"http://www.nwaonline.net/articles/2008/06/21/business/062208bigfive.txt\">Analysis of Wal-Mart's 10K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission</a> published in June by the Morning News in Arkansas revealed there are at least 80 class-action lawsuits in 41 states pending against the retailer, 76 of which stem from wage and off-the-clock issues. </p> <p>News of the Wal-Mart meetings incensed unionists. \"Wal-Mart is America's best known corporate bully,\" said Stewart Acuff, a spokesperson for the American Federation of Labour and Congress of Industrial Organisations (AFL-CIO), which is made up of 56 unions. \"They have always bullied their workers; they have always bullied their managers and supervisors and now they are trying to bully the American political system.\"</p> <p>To ensure the deep-pocketed employers don't outspend them in this election cycle, the US labour movement is on course to spend at least $300m - $400m, if you ask the US Chamber of Commerce \u2013 to back Democrats.</p> <p>Aside from aiding the election of Senator Barack Obama as president, perhaps an even more important priority is to ensure voters elect 60 Democratic Senators, which would give the party a filibuster-proof majority and ensure passage of the law no matter who is in the White House. The chances of that happening are unlikely, but not impossible.</p> <p>Acuff said that Obama, who is a co-sponsor of the legislation, will, if elected, not only sign it but also help to push for passage. \"Senator Obama understands this legislation very well. He understands why it is in the interest of the country; why it is in the interest of the economy and why it is in the interest of his presidency,\" he said.</p> <p>End of the secret ballot?</p> <p>The main crux of the EFCA is to make it easier for workers to organise. For decades the employers have chosen the method workers must use to decide on having a union and they have usually called for secret ballots.</p> <p>Under the proposed law the emphasis on who chooses the method switches to the workers. They can stick with the secret ballot or, as is more likely, initiate majority sign-up procedures, which force employers to recognise a union if a majority of employees has signed valid written forms authorising union representation.</p> <p>Acuff said the new law is necessary because the loss of power to form unions and bargain collectively \"has led to 30 years of wage stagnation and now wage decline which has led to the economic crisis that we have today. Nowadays there is just not enough buying power at the bottom.\"</p> <p>US government statistics showed that wages dropped 2.4% in the 12 months to June this year, once inflation is stripped out. Statistics also show the US in 2007 had 15.7m union members, or 12.1% of employees down, from 20.1% of workers in 1983, the first year for which comparable union data are available.</p> <p>The US Chamber of Commerce, which is spending \"several million dollars\" to fight the EFCA, as well as being a party to the $30m Coalition for a Democratic Workplace campaign, sees the possible end of the secret ballot as the biggest fault of the legislation.</p> <p>\"We think this is a fundamental rewrite of our nation's labour laws,\" said Glenn Spencer, executive director for the Chamber's workforce freedom initiative. The Chamber has other problems with the legislation; for instance it allows for binding arbitration if the union and management cannot agree on the first contract after unionisation. Also the bill imposes penalties on employers in a dispute with workers but not on unions if they are in dispute with workers.</p> <p>Spencer says the Chamber is spending its money to educate its members of the perils of the legislation and those members in turn will lobby their elected officials. He claims the employers will be outspent hugely by the unions. What the employers are spending \"will pale in comparison to the $400m the unions are putting in. Frankly we feel a little bit like the 300 Spartans here \u2026 we are totally outgunned.\"</p>",
  "<p><br>Dennis Haysbert as US president David Palmer in 24. Photograph: 20th Century Fox</p> <p>In the end, even John McCain has admitted the charming young black guy makes the best American president. \"He's fabulous. He's a guy who makes tough decisions, he takes charge, he's ready to sacrifice his interest on behalf of the interest of the country,\" McCain swooned. Unfortunately for Obama, it was 24's David Palmer who was getting McCain all fired up. It's part of an <a href=\"http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20217335_2,00.html\">interview with Entertainment Weekly</a> in which the candidates show their lighter side by revealing their pop culture favourites. Still, that's not to say the details won't be dissected at length, just as the candidates' reading and listening preferences have been.</p> <p>As the <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/tv/2008/05/is_24_the_most_pernicious_prog.html\">Republicans' favourite show</a>, 24 is a good programme for McCain to align himself with. Elsewhere, he's a little off-message. He's a big fan of Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm, despite the latter being rich in anti-Republican sentiment. Meanwhile, his wife Cindy is apparently a fan of the polygamous drama Big Love. As it's the subject of a <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/story?id=1651071\">hate campaign by Mormons</a>, perhaps we can swipe Mitt Romney off the potential VP list.</p> <p>Having thus lost much of the core vote, McCain then admits to crying when Bambi's mother got shot. But it's America's constitutional right to bear arms! What kind of sissy are we dealing with anyway?</p> <p>Perhaps it's a matter of age. Being a septuagenerian (and <a href=\"http://www.thingsyoungerthanmccain.com/\">barely older than the medium</a>), McCain is keen to show his youthful tastes in TV, with cult favourites The Wire and Dexter thrown in as well. Obama is a little more relaxed and picks M*A*S*H and The Dick Van Dyke Show as his favourites. It's good, wholesome, all-American fare, which might also dispell the myth that he's an inexperienced young whippersnapper, despite The Dick Van Dyke Show first airing two months after Obama was born.</p> <p>Overall <a href=\"http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20217406,00.html\">his choices</a> lack bite. He appears to be a slave to his wife and kids' tastes, which means lots of Hannah Montana and the Homes and Garden Channel. Quite how Americans can entrust their country to someone who won't even stand up to the tyranny of Colin and Justin is surely worthy of debate.</p> <p>Still, there's something for them both to agree on, other than government <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-AlLlfb0iw\">wire-tapping</a>: Batman. He's their superhero of choice. McCain says: \"He does justice sometimes against insurmountable odds. And he doesn't make his good works known to a lot of people.\" Obama praises Batman for having earned his superhero stripes, rather than someone like Superman who gets it too easy.</p> <p>So there we go, an unlikely hero who isn't to be underestimated and someone who hasn't earned their considerable status. You don't think they're trying to tell us something, do you?</p>",
  "<p>As Russian columns <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/11/georgia.russia3\">advance</a> into Georgia proper, columns in the American press fill with dire warnings and withering contempt for anyone so puerile as to ever trust a Russian. George Bush's infamous glimpse into Putin's soul failed to recognise what nostalgic cold warriors have always insisted was pinned to his sleeve: a heart that beats for lost imperial glory, and a ruthless ambition to match. Blogging at the Weekly Standard, John Noonan describes the Georgia conflict as the consequence of \"<a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/Weblogs/TWSFP/TWSFPView.asp\">Chamberlain-esque conflict aversion</a>\". National Review's Jonah Goldberg cries <a href=\"http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MmUxYzA5ZjRiZjYxMzRiNTIyZTJmMTBkNDIwYWRlYjI=\">that</a> \"this is what happens\" when the west takes its eye off the Russians to enjoy the Olympics. </p> <p>\"This\", of course, is the brutalisation of a hapless, innocent, fledgling democracy \u2013 a role played to the hilt by Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, who has spared no absurdity in his increasingly haggard efforts to trigger a western bailout of his hasty and ill-advised weekend invasion of long-autonomous <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article4485527.ece\">South Ossetia</a>. </p> <p>Saakashvili's overheated rhetoric \u2013 \"If the whole world does not stop Russia,\" <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/wtMostRead/idUSL768040420080808\">he has remarked</a>, \"then Russian tanks will be able to reach any other European capital\" \u2013 is illustrative of the kind of feverish thinking that is sure to transform a regional crisis into a global one. But where the frustrated desperation that Saakashvili has brought upon himself seems to explain his descent into hyperbole, American commentators have no such excuse. The real wake-up call placed by the Russo-Georgian conflict is not a clarion to a new cold war, but a head check for pro-democracy ideologues \u2013 whose idealism has ratified a style of sloppy thinking and rote sloganeering that actually threatens the durability of representative government around the world.</p> <p>The anti-Russia lobby is giving the pro-Israel lobby a run for its money, hyping the settling of scores among two European, Orthodox Christian countries as more dangerous to the peace and security of the west than any clash of civilisations or jihad ever was. Casting this conflict as a 9/11-style litmus test of patriotism and humanity, New Criterion editor <a href=\"http://pajamasmedia.com/rogerkimball/\">Roger Kimball</a> praises John McCain as a man who \"knows evil and repudiates it\", deriding Barack Obama as one \"crippled by moral relativism\" for daring to admit \"fault on both sides\". For Kimball, Russia, \"uncivilised\" as our terrorist enemies, affords the added menace of a disgruntled ex-superpower hell-bent on \"an imperialist mission\". Meanwhile, at Slate, Anne Applebaum <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2197155/\">balefully warns</a> that Russia may make \"Islamic terrorism\" look like \"the least of our problems\". </p> <p>This will only come true if the west, in a paroxysm of fear and loathing, makes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/11/russia.georgia\">an enemy of Russia</a> \u2013 which, indeed, would be a far more formidable foe than Iran, Hizbullah, and al-Qaida combined. No strategy against jihad can succeed with Russia aligned actively against the west. But no Russian official has expressed a desire to eradicate Georgia from the face of the earth, or drive the Georgian people into the sea. Nor are motives like these driving an illegal and destabilising Russian nuclear programme. Nor is our friendship with Georgia quite as deep and profound as our friendship with Israel. </p> <p>Despite moans of wishful outrage to the contrary, the small, democratic ally is not a Weberian ideal type or a Platonic form. <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/10/AR2008081002311.html?hpid=topnews\">Saakashvili</a> is a deeply imperfect leader, prone to beating his domestic opposition in the streets, and the Georgia he leads is a country that has been fragmented from birth. </p> <p>The anti-Russian reaction obscures the basic particularity of the Georgian situation, and all the history that informs it. These lost, sound judgment in pursuit of even a forthright agenda of assertive democracy promotion becomes impossible. Treating the Georgia we see on the map as if it were as sovereign and whole as the state of Israel, or Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, sets us down a path of danger and confusion. But the pro-democracy ideologues confusing big hearts for big brains make this mistake by design. </p> <p>The fact of the matter is that the territorial integrity of Georgia has been continuously undermined from within since the Abkhazians and South Ossetians first rebelled in the early 1990s. A central contention of the anti-Russian crowd holds that <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article4500362.ece\">Georgia today</a> would have been saved, if only the west had the courage to admit the country into Nato at once. But Nato membership was in large part imagined to smooth Georgia's reassertion of sovereignty in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. In short, the integrity of Nato was to be gambled on precisely the sort of move Saakashvili has just engineered to such catastrophic effect \u2013 and on the odds that Russia would abandon its citizens in those territories to frank and open aggression. How democratic.</p> <p>Another talking point advanced relentlessly by the anti-Russians proclaims, per Saakashvili, \"today Georgia, tomorrow the world\". The editors of the Washington Post have <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/08/AR2008080802741.html?hpid=opinionsbox1\">railed that</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The principles at stake, including sovereignty and territorial integrity, apply well beyond the Caucasus. To abandon Georgia and its fragile democratic Rose Revolution would send a terrible signal to other former Soviet and Warsaw Pact republics that to Moscow's dismay have achieved or are working toward democracy and fully independent foreign policies. </p> </blockquote> <p>Would that these sacrosanct principles had applied to Serbia, which fought on just those grounds to keep Kosovo an integral part of its recognised territory. But the west recognised that European integration and American good faith would both have been profoundly damaged by stiffing the Kosovans; and in a sound calculation that combined realpolitik with democratic principle, Kosovo was recognised as an independent state of the sort that, soon, Russia will be recognising Abkhazia and Ossetia as. Indeed, it is hard to see how the Georgian taste for democracy is any weaker than the Kosovan, or how the fate of Abkhazia and Ossetia affects the fate of Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, or the Baltics \u2013 long-sovereign nation-states without ungovernable autonomous regions, and Nato members to boot. </p> <p>The fact remains that even if Russia were to squander its advantages and foolishly conquer all of Georgia, the consolidation of democratic, representative government on mainland Europe would be unaffected. American foreign policy, however, would not be. As much as we must work not to make an enemy of Russia, we cannot rule out the possibility that Russia, in its zeal to teach Georgia a lesson it will never forget, may be willing to risk making an enemy of America. Given the jingoism coming from American quarters, Russia enjoys, as is its wont, plausible grounds for appealing to the simple logic of tit for tat. </p> <p>The natural response is the firm but fair stance taken up by Barack Obama and the Bush administration \u2013 cognisant of the complex of blame in the Caucasus, but adamant that Russia not devastate Georgia without consequence. The alternative, typified by the anti-Russian caucus present within the McCain campaign and the American commentariat, is to romanticise Georgia and demonise Russia out of all proportion \u2013 not so dreadful, as election-year shenanigans go, but for the most imprudent and destructive policy that must follow upon it.</p>",
  "<p>Pakistan's embattled president, Pervez Musharraf, faced a direct challenge from al-Qaida today, with the terror group lambasting his record in a new video. </p> <p>A person said to be the al-Qaida deputy leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, spoke in English on the tape, calling for an uprising not only against Musharraf but the Pakistani state, which he said was \"virtually ruled from the American embassy\". </p> <p>Pakistan's parliament meets today at the start of a special session for impeachment proceedings against Musharraf. The government has not yet released its charge sheet against the president but al-Qaida spelled out its grievances in the tape. </p> <p>\"Pervez has insulted and compromised Pakistan's sovereignty by allowing the CIA and FBI to operate freely in Pakistan and arrest, interrogate, torture, deport and detain any person, whether Pakistani or not, for as long as they like, thus turning the Pakistani army and security agencies into hunting dogs in the contemporary crusade,\" said Zawahiri. </p> <p>Zawahiri denounced Musharraf in particular for the crackdown he ordered on Islamabad's radical Red Mosque - the army raid last year resulted in around 100 deaths - and his treatment of the renegade Pakistani nuclear scientist Dr AQ Khan, who has been under house arrest for four years. </p> <p>The hatred of Musharraf among extremists demonstrates how dangerous it would be for him to remain in Pakistan after leaving office, when he would presumably lose his large security detail.</p> <p>The authenticity of the recording, delivered to a Pakistani news channel over the weekend, could not be immediately verified. Zawahiri said he was speaking in English to directly appeal to the people of Pakistan, regretting that he did not know Urdu, the national language. </p> <p>There were suggestions in the Pakistani media that the video had been fabricated by Musharraf's aides to boost public opinion in his favour, just as an al-Qaida video on the eve of the last US presidential election appeared to help George Bush's standing. However, IntelCenter, a US company that monitors militant messages, seemed to be treating it as genuine.</p> <p>The message was much broader than just an attack on Musharraf, calling for jihad against the Pakistani state, including the current government, and especially the country's military. The army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, was singled out as a \"hostile enemy of Islam\". </p> <p>\"Let there be no doubt in your minds that the dominant political forces at work in Pakistan today are competing to appease and please the modern day crusaders in the White House, and are working to destabilise this nuclear-capable nation under the aegis of America,\" said Zawahiri. </p> <p>Musharraf shows no signs of resigning after the coalition last week announced it would try to impeach him. Parliament would need to muster a two-thirds majority to do so, and the numbers look close. </p> <p>The country's four provincial assemblies will from today be passing resolutions against Musharraf. The national parliament will start to meet today but the charges against the president are still to be announced and the process is set to continue into next week. </p> <p>In a weekend military offensive in the Bajur region, an insurgent stronghold near the Afghan border considered a possible hiding place for al-Qaida leaders, Pakistani forces bombed dozens of houses, killing at least 100 insurgents and nine paramilitary troops, according to witnesses. </p> <p>Details are scarce about the offensive, but Sardar Khan, a local police official, said two aerial bombing raids destroyed about 40 houses in several villages. He said bombs hit a school occupied by Taliban fighters.</p>",
  "<p>Nato's secretary general today joined George Bush in criticising Russia over its \"disproportionate\" use of force against Georgia in the Caucasus.</p> <p>A spokeswoman said Jaap de Hoop Scheffer was \"seriously concerned\" about Russia's response and its \"lack of respect for the territorial integrity of Georgia\", the former Soviet republic that Nato leaders declared in April would one day be a member of the alliance.</p> <p>The statement followed Bush's comments to a US sports broadcaster in Beijing, where he was watching the Olympics. He said he had spoken \"firmly\" to the Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin, who was directing the Kremlin's actions in Georgia.</p> <p>\"I was very firm with Vladimir Putin,\" Bush told NBC Sports. \"I expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of Russia. We strongly condemn bombing outside of South Ossetia.\"</p> <p>Despite the criticism, Russia today continued its assault on Georgia. Tbilisi said up to 50 Russian bombers had attacked its territory overnight, with one Russian bomb reported to have landed near Tbilisi's civilian airport shortly after the French foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, had landed.</p> <p>Russia, however, accused Georgia of violating its own ceasefire in the breakaway region.</p> <p>Moscow justified beefing-up its forces in a second separatist region, Abkhazia, as an attempt to prevent a repeat of what it called Georgia's \"genocide\" in the South Ossetian capital, Tskhinvali.</p> <p>In a move that could widen the conflict, Russia said it had boosted its forces in the Black Sea region to 9,000, although peacekeeping agreements allow it to have only 2,500 troops there. Moscow has flown in heavy artillery for the last two days and its Black Sea fleet is blockading the coast.</p> <p>\"The strengthening of the peacekeeping force is aimed at ruling out a repetition of the situation Russian peacekeepers faced in Tskhinvali, \" Alexander Novitsky, the commander of the Russian peacekeepers, told the Interfax news agency. \"Our troops have to defend civilians and avert a humanitarian catastrophe.\"</p> <p>Russia says 2,000 civilians were killed and thousands made homeless when Georgia attacked South Ossetia last week in an attempt to bring the separatists to heel. Witness accounts suggest the death toll was very high.</p> <p>Abkhazian fighters were blocking Georgian troops in the Kodori Valley, the last part of Abkhazia still controlled by Tbilisi.</p> <p>Russian peacekeepers issued an ultimatum to Georgia to lay down its arms in the Zugdidi district bordering Abkhazia, which the Georgians rejected, according to Interfax.</p> <p>The French and Finnish foreign ministers, who visited Tbilisi last night, were due in Moscow today hoping to persuade Russia that its retaliation against Georgia had gone far enough.</p> <p>In a phone call to the Georgian president, Mikheil Saakashvili, the US vice-president, Dick Cheney, said Russian aggression must not go unanswered and that there would be serious consequences for its relations with the west if Moscow persisted.</p> <p>Cheney did not spell out what sanctions might follow, but the threat of Russia's expulsion from the G8 - something that Republican presidential candidate John McCain has advocated in the past - might be one lever Washington could consider pulling.</p> <p>On Sunday, a Russian defence spokesman said the army was not planning to push beyond the borders of disputed South Ossetia: \"We do not plan to break into Georgian territory beyond the borders marked to the peacekeepers,\" Colonel-General Anatoly Nogovitsyn told reporters.</p> <p>However, with the momentum provided by the war, the Kremlin may see a chance to overthrow the Tblisi regime that has irritated Russia with its pro-western stance and aspirations to join Nato.</p>",
  "<p>The Bolivian president, Evo Morales, easily won a recall referendum last night and vowed to press ahead with plans to transform the country into a leftwing centralist state. </p> <p>Morales, a former coca leaf farmer who is Bolivia's first indigenous leader, hopes the victory will enable him to push through reforms including nationalisations, land redistribution and a constitution favouring the long-marginalised indigenous majority.</p> <p>\"What the Bolivian people have expressed with their votes \u2026 is the consolidation of change,\" Morales told thousands of cheering supporters who gathered outside his presidential palace in La Paz. </p> <p>\"We're here to move forward with the recovery of our natural resources, the consolidation of nationalisation and the state takeover of companies.\" </p> <p>Unofficial exit polls said Morales had secured 60-66% of the vote \u2013 an improvement on his result in the last presidential election, in December 2005, when he took nearly 54%. </p> <p>An exit poll by the private TV channel Unitel said Morales had won 60.12% of the vote, while a count by the pollster Ipsos Apoyo for channel ATB gave him 63.1%. Final official results are due in the next few days.</p> <p>However, last night's vote also saw the re-election of regional governors who oppose his reforms and want autonomy for their resource-rich provinces. Their victories mean the conflict over his proposals will continue, with both sides feeling they have won a new mandate to stand firm.</p> <p>Supporters of Morales and the main opposition governors alike took to the streets waving banners, chanting, dancing and setting off firecrackers after a peaceful vote that contrasted with violent protests earlier in the week. </p> <p>\"I'm glad he has won, because Mr Morales is one of us - he's working class like me,\" said Hector Gutierrez, a 32-year-old computer technician. </p> <p>\"I expect things to improve now, because someone from the same background as me cannot let me down.\" </p> <p>The bitter power struggle between Morales and opposition governors has exposed deep divisions between the wealthier east and the more indigenous west of the country, forcing him to put many reforms on hold. </p> <p>Morales approved the referendum in an apparent bid to undermine the regional governors' campaigns for autonomy, but the results suggest a standoff will continue unless a compromise can be negotiated. </p> <p>\"The initial reading is that the political crisis and tension in the country is going to deepen greatly,\" said Franklin Pareja, a professor of political science at the state-run San Andres University in La Paz. </p> <p>Regional governors are angry that Morales has cut their share of windfall natural gas revenues, accusing him of governing only for his supporters. </p> <p>They also see him as a lackey of the Venezuelan president, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the vocal leader of a group of radical leftwing Latin American presidents.</p>",
