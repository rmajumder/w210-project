  "<p>Sarah Palin may have seen the light - sort of - on climate change but that did not spare her from being singled out yesterday as America's environmental enemy of the year.</p> <p>The Centre for Biological Diversity awarded Palin its Rubber Dodo award for her insistence - despite evidence to the contrary - that the polar bear population was rising across the Arctic. The Arizona thinktank condemned the Alaska governor as a \"global warming denier\".</p> <p>\"Governor Palin has waged a deceptive, dangerous, and costly battle against the polar bear,\" Kieran Suckling, the centre's director, said. \"Her position on global warming is so extreme, she makes Dick Cheney look like an Al Gore devotee.\"</p> <p>The slap comes less than a week after Palin belatedly admitted the possibility of a human factor in climate change, in her first television interview since she was chosen as John McCain's running mate.</p> <p>The conversion was followed by further revelations of Palin's tenuous relationship with scientific fact. News reports yesterday said that Palin bought a tanning bed and moved it into the governor's mansion soon after her election. A few months later, in May 2007, she issued a proclamation during skin cancer awareness month urging Alaskans to take preventive measures. \"Skin cancer is caused, overwhelmingly, by overexposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun and from tanning beds,\" she said in a press release.</p> <p>McCain had skin cancers removed in 1993 and 2000, and is religious about using sun screen and wearing a hat outdoors.</p>",
  "<p>Merrill Lynch's newly recruited chief executive, John Thain, stands to share a $200m (\u00a3111.4m) payout with two senior lieutenants for less than a year's work which culminated this week in the bank surrendering its 94-year-old independence.</p> <p>The Wall Street bank known as the \"thundering herd\" agreed to a $50bn takeover by Bank of America on Monday after a hasty 48 hours of negotiation. The talks were prompted by fears over banking stability arising from the collapse of Lehman Brothers.</p> <p>Thain, who was previously the head of the New York Stock Exchange, joined Merrill in December with a mandate to steer the bank out of financial trouble. When he arrived, he was given a $15m signing on bonus. If he leaves in Bank of America's takeover, he stands to get a further $11m in accelerated stock payouts.</p> <p>Two former Goldman Sachs executives hired by Thain are likely to do even better. Merrill's head of global trading, Thomas Montag, who joined in August, has already received a $39m bonus. Together with stock options accelerated by a buyout, he could end the year with $76m. The bank's head of strategy, Peter Kraus, was given a $95m package including bonuses and stock awards to replace his generous compensation at Goldman when he joined in May, according to figures obtained by Bloomberg News.</p> <p>It is yet to be determined whether any of the trio will have a role at Bank of America. Even by the standards of Wall Street payouts, the sums are unusually high for such a short period of employment. </p> <p>Steven Hall, a New York-based executive remuneration expert, told the Guardian that Merrill had little choice but to honour the contracts: \"At the time they were recruiting [Thain], a negotiation took place and he would have told them this is what his price was. You can't go back and change things now - it's almost a kind of buyer's remorse we may be seeing.\"</p> <p>Thain, 53, is a leading fundraiser for the Republican presidential candidate John McCain. A doctor's son, he is an amateur beekeeper who used to keep hives in his back garden. He bought a two-bedroom apartment on New York's Park Avenue two years ago which had an asking price of $27.5m. He was hired by Merrill to steady the ship after huge losses on the credit markets which were run up under the leadership of ousted chief executive Stan O'Neal. At a press conference this week to announce the buyout by Bank of America, Thain admitted that selling Merrill was not the original plan: \"This isn't necessarily the outcome I would have expected when I took the job.\"</p> <p>He insisted that he had made progress in tidying up Merrill: \"We've been consistently cleaning up the balance sheet, repairing the damage that had been done over the last two or three years.\"</p> <p>Thain reportedly fought back tears at a meeting to brief staff on Merrill's buyout this week. Analysts say that Merrill's liabilities were greater than he could have anticipated when he joined - and some have praised his decision to sell.</p> <p>Defenders of Wall Street's controversial pay packages generally argue that although bankers do well during good times, they hold insecure jobs which are vulnerable during downturns.</p> <p>\"What we do see is that when times get tough, people lose their jobs - and that's the ultimate in pay cuts,\" said Hall.</p> <p>A Merrill Lynch spokesman said the bank would not comment on executive compensation beyond the statutory disclosures required in filings with regulators.</p>",
  "<p>The scale of the crisis engulfing the global financial system can no longer be in doubt. The events of the past few days have confirmed that we are living through the greatest meltdown since the Wall Street crash of 1929. For the second time in barely a week, an avowedly free market government in the citadel of laissez-faire capitalism has been forced to nationalise a linchpin of American finance - this time the world's biggest insurance company, AIG - in an effort to prevent the toxin of collapse spreading further through the US economy. </p> <p>That followed hard on the heels of the nationalisation of the mortgage giants Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae; the bankruptcy of the country's fourth largest investment bank, Lehman Brothers - corroded by bad debt and bonus-fuelled speculation - and the forced takeover of Merrill Lynch. And a year after the credit crunch triggered the fatal run on Northern Rock, British high street retail banks are being sucked into the crisis: at one point yesterday the country's largest mortgage lender, HBOS, had lost almost 70% of its share value since the start of the week.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the impact on the real economy is becoming stronger: output in Britain is falling and official unemployment is likely to rise above 2 million next year - the real figure will be significantly higher. More than 100,000 jobs are expected to go in finance alone. The only question is how deep and prolonged the recession will now be. </p> <p>What is certain is that the dominance of the free-market model of capitalism, which has held sway across the world for more than two decades, is rapidly coming to an end. When its high priests in Washington are forced to carry out the largest nationalisations ever undertaken outside the communist world, while intervening on an unprecedented scale across markets that were supposed to be self-regulating in order to keep the system afloat, the neoliberal order is transparently falling apart. </p> <p>Naturally, market fundamentalists and ideologues will continue to preach the old religion. The Times argued yesterday that the unfolding of the banking crisis showed that capitalism and markets were working, however \"brutal and unforgiving\" that might sound. Such otherworldly dogma is not a luxury candidates standing for election can afford - and even John McCain felt obliged this week to attack Wall Street's \"casino [of] greed, corruption of excess\", while Barack Obama blamed McCain's economic philosophy of deregulation and called for wide-ranging reform.</p> <p>That is exactly what should be happening in Britain. But instead, across the main political parties, there is a striking and continuing failure to face up to the extent of the economic crisis or the sea change in policy it must herald. Britain's political class appears to be wedded to the politics of the 1990s and the glory days of neoliberalism, clinging to the economic legacy of Thatcherism and unable to make the shift from deregulation to intervention that the times demand.</p> <p>The government has the most to gain and least to lose by doing so. But it's hamstrung by Gordon Brown's paralysing caution and New Labour's original Blairite embrace of market ideology, private provision and corporate privilege. When Alistair Darling declared on Tuesday that he was \"extremely anxious\" about speculative manipulation of the markets, he invited the obvious question of what on earth he plans to do about it - and why he and Brown insisted on the \"light-touch regulation\" that created the destructive derivative whirligig in the first place.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats could be capitalising on the early warnings from Vince Cable, their new superhero, about the debt crisis and his calls for the public ownership of Northern Rock. But instead of building on the tradition of Keynes and Lloyd George, their leader Nick Clegg has chosen this of all moments to orchestrate a symbolic return to economic liberalism, forcing through a commitment to cut both taxation and spending. </p> <p>The issue is not, of course, the Lib Dems' welcome proposals to redistribute the tax burden from the low to the high paid - it's the new plan to pay for extra tax cuts by reducing the overall level of public expenditure. Not only are spending cuts the last thing the economy needs as it sinks into recession. But underpinning the new policy is Clegg's personal ideological conviction that state intervention is dead - exactly the opposite of what is required in the face of the storms now sweeping away the neoliberal nostrums of the past.</p> <p>It also gives political cover to David Cameron's parallel enthusiasm for a smaller state, backed up by more charity provision for the poor. Much has been made of the Tories' latter-day conversion to social liberalism, their new enthusiasm for fairness and their self-proclaimed \"progressive\" agenda. Certainly, their rhetoric is a long way from the confrontational style of the Thatcher era - even if the word \"progressive\" has, as the social democratic sage David Marquand argues, been largely gutted of any meaning. </p> <p>But when it comes to the core social and economic choices, all the signs are that Cameron's Tories plan to follow precisely the same agenda of corporate privilege, deregulation, privatisation of public services and low taxes for the rich inherited from his Conservative predecessors via Tony Blair. Already George Osborne is moving away from his commitment to stick to Labour's spending plans, while Cameron has declared that redistribution of wealth and income is an \"approach that has run out of road\".</p> <p>But that agenda is precisely the model that has delivered today's financial breakdown. And as a result, the leaders of the party expected to win the next general election - tied as they are to City and corporate interests - have even less to say about the crisis carving a swathe through finance and the wider economy, and what to do about it, than Brown and his unfortunate chancellor. Beyond calling for better bank deposit protection, Osborne seems to be utterly at sea.</p> <p>This all represents a woeful failure of institutional politics. But it is also a gift to anyone prepared to push a new agenda that breaks with the failed market orthodoxy and faces up to the reality of our times: that only decisive public intervention and regulation can begin to deal with the economic - or, for that matter, environmental - crises we face. For any Labour politician thinking of standing against the prime minister, that has to be the starting point.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:s.milne@theguardian.com\">s.milne@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337738748\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>Barack Obama and John McCain spent millions of dollars yesterday in an unprecedented advertising spree selling their economic messages, as the first opinion polls since the Wall Street meltdown showed a shift towards the Democratic candidate.</p> <p>With the two battling to establish a decisive poll lead, Obama paid for an expensive two-minute slot on national cable television, targeting the 12 so-called battlefield states. Until now television ads have generally been 30-second bursts.</p> <p>The new batch of polls appeared to bear out optimism in the Obama camp that he, rather than McCain, stands to benefit from the impact on voters of the financial collapses. Polls taken since the crisis erupted on Monday suggests the momentum built up behind McCain over the last few weeks has been halted. The latest polls leave the two in a dead heat.</p> <p>A CNN/Time poll released last night showed Obama closing the gap in battlefield states such as Ohio and Florida, which both voted Republican last time. Obama is now tied with McCain on 48% each in Florida and enjoys a 2% lead in Ohio. In North Carolina, normally a safe Republican state, McCain's lead has been reduced to 1%.</p> <p>A New York Times/CBS poll published today found six out of 10 of those surveyed expressed confidence in Obama to run the economy, compared with five out of 10 for McCain. More significantly for Obama's hopes, one in three said their family is worse off than it was four years ago.</p> <p>Obama's ad called for an end to \"the anything-goes culture on Wall Street, with real regulation that protects your investments and pensions\".</p> <p>McCain also put out a campaign ad, aimed at trying to undo damage caused by his remark on Monday that the US economy was fundamentally strong. He sought to distance himself from George Bush's administration and blame corporate greed, as well as to reassure voters.</p> <p>\"Enough is enough,\" he said in the ad. \"I'll meet this financial crisis head on. Reform Wall Street ... Your savings, your jobs I'll keep them safe.\"</p> <p>Neither Obama nor McCain has a background in economics. Obama has yet to establish a convincing message about how to tackle the economy, and his trademark inspirational rhetoric deserts him when he turns to economic matters.</p> <p>McCain admitted this year that he knows little about economics, having specialised in foreign affairs most his life.</p> <p>Neil Newhouse, a Republican pollster, said yesterday that the meltdown should help Obama. But, he added, the poll advantage would go to \"the first of the two who finds his voice\".</p> <p>Some campaign ads are never aired, put together only as a cheap way to gain media attention. It is a sign of how important the two teams judge the current crisis that they are prepared to spend big. Normally, a candidate would only buy a two-minute slot at the closing stage of a campaign.</p> <p>The spending yesterday will push up their advertising bills, at present running at roughly $15m each a week. Much of the advertising from both teams is in the traditional battlefield states of Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida.</p> <p>The economic crisis has drowned out almost all the trivia and negative personal attacks which had characterised the campaign over the last few weeks.</p> <p>McCain yesterday ridiculed Obama for holding a Hollywood celebrity fundraiser with Barbra Streisand on Tuesday night _ which raised $9m, saying the Democratic candidate was not exactly siding with the people.</p> <p>But the jibe about Obama and celebrities, a regular McCain theme, attracted little media attention. Nor did the decision of a former Hillary Clinton supporter, Lady Lynn Forester de Rothschild, who is married to the British banker and who raised $100,000 for Clinton, to announce she would not be voting for Obama, saying he was \"too far to the left\".</p>",
  "<p>It was only a decade ago that Tzipi Livni decided to become a politician. She had served as a young agent in Israel's foreign secret service, the Mossad, and then gave up an agency career to become a commercial lawyer until one autumn holiday, not long after the signing of the Oslo peace accords with the Palestinians, she decided to step into politics. Now she is just weeks away from becoming Israel's next prime minister after winning a striking victory in her Kadima party's leadership election yesterday.</p> <p>Livni, who is 50 and married with two sons, has been long tipped as a future leader and in recent months emerged as more dovish than many in her party. On the Palestinian front she advocates a two-state, negotiated settlement, though she adamantly resists any prospect of a return for Palestinian refugees into what is now Israel. On Iran and its nuclear ambitions she favours a tightening of sanctions, but seems less eager than other leading politicians for an outright military confrontation.</p> <p>Yet her background is more firmly embedded in Israel's right-wing. She was born into a \"fighting family\" and one that is much respected in Israel. Her father, Eitan Livni, was a senior figure in the Irgun, the underground militant Zionist movement that fought the British before the creation of the state. When she turned to politics, she turned naturally to the Likud, the leading rightist party.</p> <p>But three years ago she followed the then prime minister and Likud leader, Ariel Sharon, when he left the party, created his own movement, Kadima, or Forward. He argued that the dream of a Greater Israel from the Mediterranean to the River Jordan was unachievable and that the land should be shared with a Palestinian state. The creation of that Palestinian state is still a distant prospect, but many argue Livni is committed to a two-state solution to the seemingly intractable Middle East conflict.</p> <p>Avraham Diskin, a political scientist at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, said Livni was more dovish than her challengers for the party leadership. \"Ideologically everybody is now in the centre, people realise the risk and want to have peace and pay the price but the difference is in the nuances,\" he said. \"But she is emotionally involved, not just ideologically, she is very interested and she is a believer.\"</p> <p>Livni has been Israel's lead negotiator in the current talks with the Palestinians which began in Annapolis, in the United States, in November last year. With Livni as prime minister those talks could be expected to continue, perhaps even with a successful result. \"With her there is a chance of a conclusion, of having a piece of paper. What happens after that is difficult. But she is very highly motivated,\" Diskin said.</p> <p>However, the prospect of a peace agreement will depend just as heavily on the outcome of the US presidential elections. Even following a year of talks there are precious few signs of progress on the ground on the core issues and much evidence that the situation is slowly worsening.</p> <p>Livni herself made it clear just last month that she would not be rushed into a deal. \"I think that any attempt to bridge gaps that maybe it's premature to bridge, or to reach something that is not the comprehensive agreement that we want to reach can lead to doing it wrong just because of the pressure,\" she said.</p> <p>But before there can be negotiations, Livni must first form a coalition government. She will meet with Shimon Peres, the Israeli president, this week and he will give her 42 days to bring onside enough allied parties to form a majority in the Knesset, or parliament. Kadima has 29 seats in the 120-seat Knesset and will need Labour's 19 seats as well as other smaller parties, whose support will be more difficult to secure. There is likely to be a long period of back-room negotiating that will test Livni's skill before a deal is done and which may demand compromises that later limit her ability to strike a deal with the Palestinians.</p> <p>She will also be operating in an intensely male environment, where military experience is often as highly regarded as political acumen. She has already had to fight off suggestions she might be too weak for the job. \"The fact that I'm a woman doesn't make me a weak leader,\" she told the Jerusalem Post last week. \"It's not that generals pull the trigger and women don't. I have no problem pulling the trigger when necessary.\"</p> <p>One of her greatest challenges will be to restore some integrity to the tainted Israeli political system. She has a rare, corruption-free, \"Mrs Clean\" reputation, but will have an uphill battle to restore the public's faith in her colleagues. After all, her rise to the most powerful job in Israel only comes because of the fall of the current prime minister, Ehud Olmert, who has faced five separate corruption investigations in the past two years.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Barack Obama</strong> was in Beverly Hills the other night raising an eye-watering $9m at a dinner organised by <strong>Barbra Streisand</strong>, and attended by <strong>Will Ferrell</strong>, <strong>Leonardo DiCaprio</strong> and <strong>Steven Spielberg</strong> among others. That was possibly just as well, as the Democrats have lost one of their most affluent backers to the other side. <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> supporter <strong>Lynn Forester de Rothschild</strong>, the American corporate lawyer married to <strong>Sir Evelyn de Rothschild</strong>, was expected last night to announce her support for <strong>John McCain</strong>, apparently on the curious grounds that Obama is too elitist for her. Lady Rothschild, the banker's third wife - the couple stayed with the Clintons at the White House following their wedding in 2000 and also count <strong>Tony</strong> and <strong>Cherie Blair</strong> as friends - is one of Hillary's irreconcilables. She told CNN in July: \"Frankly I don't like him. I feel he is an elitist. I feel like he has not given me a reason to trust him.\" It is not quite clear what Obama could have done to be less elitist than a woman, worth $100m in her own right, who sits on the board of Est\u00e9e Lauder and whose husband owns a house in Chelsea and 3,200 acres in Buckinghamshire.

  "<p>Even before Meltdown Monday, I was going to write about the politics of fear. Now I must add the politics of panic. Observing this American election close up, what strikes me with the force of Hurricane Ike is just how defensive, nervous and angst-ridden the tone of the campaign has become.</p> <p>While Barack Obama still proclaims \"the audacity of hope\", this is almost as true of his recent stump speeches as it is of John McCain's. Sarah Palin aside, this election is now all about the fears of the \"middle class\" (a capacious category, in which more than 50% of Americans place themselves). It's about \"ordinary folks\" worrying that they will lose their homes, their jobs, their healthcare and their savings.</p> <p>And that was before Monday's collapse of Lehman Brothers and sale of Merrill Lynch seemed to confirm that we face what Obama called, that same day, \"the most serious financial crisis since the Great Depression\". Yes, says the fabled former head of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, this crisis is the worst in his lifetime, the kind of event that happens \"once in a half-century, probably once in a century\".</p> <p>Americans already had plenty to be frightened about. Unemployment rose to 6.1% last month. House prices have plummeted, petrol prices rocketed. Home repossessions have hit record highs, as people cannot make the payments on mortgages they should never have been offered. Millions have fallen out of or reduced their healthcare insurance, unable to afford the premiums.</p> <p>This is a country that has been living beyond its means, on a bouncy castle of debt. Last year the US commerce department reported that the after-tax personal savings rate had been negative in 2005 and 2006, for the first time since - wait for it - 1932 and 1933. This year it revised those figures slightly, so the adjusted rate comes out at just above zero. Why save, when China will do it for you?</p> <p>That picture is not entirely fair, because most working Americans squirrel away some of their earnings before tax, in a pension wrapper known to everyone as \"a 401(k)\", after the relevant paragraph of the tax code. But as the markets fall, the value of those savings falls too - even if you didn't have some of your 401(k) in Lehman Brothers. In the course of a brief cafeteria lunchbreak while writing this column, I heard the words 401(k) trembling through two conversations. More losses. More angst.</p> <p>All this comes in the larger context that I described last week, as people sense that nations like China are rising relative to the US. Not to mention a terrorist attack on the American embassy in Yemen. And, if you live on the gulf coast, tropical storms Gustav, Hanna, Ike and Josephine. Watching 24-hour cable news, you have the sense that even nature is conspiring against the US.</p> <p>Today's Americans have a lot more to fear than fear itself - to recall the famous words of Franklin D Roosevelt in his 1933 inaugural address. But fear doesn't help either. In markets, confidence is everything. Even before this week's sinking of the Lehman Titanic, more than two-thirds of those asked by pollsters said they thought their country was in a recession or a depression - and that things will not get better in 2009. God knows what they'll say now.</p> <p>I am not qualified to judge whether the underlying \"fundamentals\" of the US economy are strong enough to pull the whole show back up - homes, jobs, healthcare, 401(k)s and all - in a couple of years. Let's revisit that in 2010. Meanwhile, there are fewer than 1,200 hours till general election day.</p> <p>So put to one side, for a moment, the economics of fear; the immediate question is how the politics of fear play into the election contest.</p> <p>If people vote with their heads, \"the economy, stupid\" should help Obama to victory. For all the external causes in the world beyond America's shores, this financial and economic hurricane has blown up on George W Bush's watch, and at least partly because of things his administration has done (for instance, overspent) or failed to do (under- or misregulated the financial sector).</p> <p>McCain's economic policies are not so different, nor is he very convincing in presenting them. He wobbled in his first response to Meltdown Monday, before flip-flopping on Tuesday. As for Palin: in a world increasingly shaped by Wikinomics, the last thing the US needs is Wasillanomics.</p> <p>Moreover, there may be a larger pattern involved here. The American columnist Michael Kinsley has a characteristically ingenious article at Slate.com which compares a number of economic indicators, including GDP per capita, inflation, unemployment, federal taxes, spending and budget deficit, over Republican and Democrat presidencies since 1959.</p> <p>The Democrats score better on everything except lower taxes. Above all, the historical evidence suggests that Republican administrations spend more and increase the budget deficit. It's not just Kinsley's figures that point this way. In the past, I have heard one of the US's most celebrated libertarian economists quietly observe that if you really believe in small government, you should vote Democrat.</p> <p>Now economists could no doubt argue about every one of these figures till the pigs come home (with or without lipstick), but the political conclusion seems to me to be clear. If you think the economy is the most important issue in this election - which nearly two-thirds of those asked say they do, while less than a quarter name Iraq - and if you are a rational punter, then your rational choice would be to give the Democrats a chance of doing better than the Bush administration has done.</p> <p>If people vote with their heads, that is. But people often vote with other parts of their anatomy (heart, gut - choose your organ). And there's a deeper politics of fear that runs against Obama. This is not about facts and policies, but about perceptions, characters, stories, dreams - about feelings that men and women only half-recognise and rarely confess. Yes, that includes race. In a CBS-New York Times poll in July, only 5% of white voters acknowledged that they would not vote for a black candidate, but 24% said America wasn't ready to elect a black president. But it also involves the whole otherness, newness, complexity of him.</p> <p>Obama, a child of the world as it is, offers a dream of the world as it might be. (That's why so much of the world thrills to him, and will be devastated if he loses.) McCain, Vietnam hero, and Palin, hockey mom, offer a dream of the US as it once was. Rational this may not be, but voters who are fearful, defensive, and unhappy with the way the world is going, may just prefer to hunker down with the reassuring familiarity of that vision of America. \"Got hope?\" challenges the Obama bumper sticker. At the moment, America has got fear. And the temerity of fear may yet defeat the audacity of hope.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.timothygartonash.com\">www.timothygartonash.com</a></p> <p><em>Do you agree with this analysis: will voters' economic concerns favour McCain over Obama in November's election?

  "<p>There's no denying it: Sarah Palin has energised the presidential race, and she has had <a href=\"http://blogs.independent.co.uk/the_campaign_trailers/2008/09/snapshot-of-the.html\">no greater impact than in the south</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/\">funny poll numbers</a> show it pretty clearly. The Republican base has risen from its sickbed for this wild woman from the far north with an enthusiasm not seen since 2004 when George Bush and Karl Rove made \"swiftboating\" part of the political lexicon. I've watched local Republicans puff up their chest and boast about their candidate for the first time since the race began. Her frontier background, God-fearing, gun-totin' ways and defiant tone (not to mention her conservative feminine allure) have revived \u2013 <a href=\"http://hotlineblog.nationaljournal.com/archives/2008/09/diageohotline_t_6.html\">somewhat</a> \u2013 the GOP political machine.</p> <p>But what the sudden rush of punditry about Palin isn't mentioning much is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/15/us/politics/15donors.html?em\">the other faction she has energised</a>. While the GOP rejoices, the Democrats look upon Palin with horror, seeing a living representation of everything they are fighting against. And after a few weeks of freaking out they are getting to work with new defiant energy and a grim determination. </p> <p>The progressive wing of the Democratic party loathes Palin and everything she stands for: corporate exploitation of natural resources, knee-jerk patriotic jingoism, an abhorrence for social programmes, the proud ignorance of the frontier-style \"ugly American\" \u2013 not to mention slaughtering woodland creatures for fun. The more moderate wing of Barack Obama enthusiasts see her as a threat to their candidate's historic journey, a cheap and cynical play by a decrepit regime desperate to retain power \u2013 and they're pushing that much harder to get out the vote and register new voters. </p> <p>And then there are the former Pumas. For those who didn't pay close attention to the intricacies of the Democratic convention this year (how I envy you!), <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/07/hillaryclinton.barackobama\">Puma</a> \u2013 \"party unity my ass!\" \u2013 was the title adopted by intransigent Hillary Clinton supporters who were bound and determined to spoil Obama's big day. But after the conciliatory tone of the convention and the bombshell announcement of Palin's spot as running-mate, the Pumas around town have largely re-assessed their strategy. McCain's choice of Palin was clearly designed to lure them away from the Democrats. And a few of the more marginal of Hillary's supporters are, indeed, considering the McCain ticket in a new light.</p> <p>But the vast majority of Hillary's partisans <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gbJvGZDG9ZD_SsuZpy-SSApOaW7AD93858M00\">see Palin as a pathetic mockery of everything they cherished about Clinton's historic run</a>. They see it as a bald-faced and cynical attempt to stack the deck against their candidate. In a word, they are pissed off in such a way that makes their ire at Obama's people a faint memory.</p> <p>At the risk of courting charges of sexism, I'll go ahead and claim that women, not men, are more ruthlessly savage in their judgments of other women. I make this claim having worked in three or four female-dominated industries and witnessing the group female dynamic in all of its glory. Women can be vicious when it comes to other women, and the former Pumas have unsheathed their claws on the subject of Palin.</p> <p>\"She's like every self-important PTA mom I've ever met,\" one of my Clinton-supporting pals, a woman in her 50s I used to work for, confesses to me defiantly. \"She's the woman who dominates every organisation she's part of, demands that her vision become the standard, ruthlessly crushes every opponent \u2026 \" she sputters as she reveals her loathing of the candidate. \"And she's expecting to walk into the presidency without earning it,\" she condemned. \"That just ain't gonna happen! We've got the supreme court to consider. I didn't fight for Hillary all this time just to see some other woman, especially this one, get there first.\"</p> <p>Another former Hillary-ite is less diplomatic in her assessment. \"She said she's a hockey mom, which is like a pit bull with lipstick,\" this 40ish single mom concludes. \"I've seen her record. All glam and no glory. She's just not that good. I'm not impressed. Every time she opens her mouth, she seems to put her foot in it. She's a paper pit bull. She didn't get anyone excited who was going to vote for Obama, anyway.\"</p> <p>One is looking forward to what she sees as an inevitable cat-fight between the two. \"I can't wait until Hill unloads on that \u2026 witch,\" she says, choosing her words carefully as her two-year-old runs into the room. \"She'd take her apart in a debate. Obama behaved \u2013 more or less \u2013 like a gentleman. If Hill goes after her, Sarah will look like one of those moose she hunts afterwards. Metaphorically.\"</p> <p>There are, of course, those former Hillary supporters who are so wounded that they are still reluctant to support Obama, despite Palin's explosive arrival on the campaign scene. \"I know it's an important race,\" one woman in her 30s tells me, mournfully. \"But my 'guy' isn't in it any more. She should have been offered the VP spot. She wasn't, so I don't care who wins, now. I'm sure it will be Obama, but it will have to be without my vote. I'll vote third-party, I guess.\"</p> <p>The Obama rank-and-file (many of them political novices) are justifiably wary of the threat Palin poses to their candidate. But they are being <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/5050/story?id=5821280&amp;page=1\">well-directed by the campaign</a>, putting their energy into productive ventures like voter registration, organisation and encouraging the small-donor fundraising that has become Obama's bread-and-butter. They haven't missed the Republicans around town, behaving as if there were a chance at winning for the first time this campaign. They're worried, but not paralysed. But as one of the volunteers confides to me: \"If we take this all the way to election day and we lose, well, Hillary can kiss the presidency goodbye. There won't be enough hope left in the country for her to hope to be elected.\"</p>",
  "<p>Remember yesterday I was griping that Obama never told a joke? Do I get action or what? Today he told a joke! And it wasn't bad:</p> <blockquote> <p>And now he tells us that he's the one who's gonna' to take on the old boys network. The old boys network? In the McCain campaign that's called a staff meeting.

  "<p>A group of Democratic congresswomen today seized on the grim economic news to portray Barack Obama as the presidential candidate best able to improve American women's financial lot.</p> <p>The congresswomen, led by House speaker Nancy Pelosi, this morning attacked John McCain's opposition to expansion of a children's health insurance programme and to legislation seeking equal pay for women, and said his healthcare plan could leave millions of women without insurance.</p> <p>Pelosi said: \"He says he wants private accounts along the lines of the Bush plan. Can you just imagine if President Bush had prevailed, earlier this week when the stock market went down 500 points in one day? That's not social security, that's social insecurity that John McCain supports\". McCain has said he would allow younger workers to divert some of their social security contributions to private accounts invested in stocks.</p> <p>The press conference at the Democratic party headquarters came as McCain has made small but steady gains among women voters, helped by his selection of Alaska governor Sarah Palin as his running mate. Democrats typically hold an advantage among voters on economic issues, and this year polls show voters tend to trust Obama more to handle the economy, although by a slim margin. </p> <p>The Democratic women noted McCain's opposition this spring to a bill that sought equal pay for female workers. McCain skipped the vote in the Senate, saying he opposed the bill because it would have led to more lawsuits.</p> <p>\"To make opportunity real and to knock down this wall that blocks women's progress, we have to send, and elect Barack Obama to the White House,\" said Rosa Delauro, a representative from Connecticut.</p> <p>The group today said that McCain's healthcare plan would leave more women without insurance. His plan involves shifting Americans into individual health insurance programmes rather than ones sponsored by employers. The Centre for American Progress Action Fund, a liberal research organisation, said in a recent study that more than 59m women insured through their employers would be at risk of losing coverage.</p> <p>\"A vote for John McCain is a vote to jeopardise women's access to healthcare,\" said Linda Sanchez, a Democratic congresswoman from California.</p> <p>In response to the Democratic attacks on McCain's legislative record and policy proposals, the McCain campaign noted that Obama's Senate office employs fewer women in top positions than McCain's.</p> <p>\"Barack Obama says he's for equal pay for women, but women working in his Senate office earn an average of $9,000 less than men,\" spokesman Brian Rogers said. </p> <p>\"By contrast, women in John McCain's Senate office actually earn an average of nearly $2,000 more than men. The American people understand that real leadership for the change we need is all about what you do, not just empty words.\"</p>",
  "<p>Preoccupied with the Georgia-Russia crisis and the old fears it has resurrected, the world risks missing another important story unfolding in the Caucasus \u2013 that of Azerbaijan. The oil-rich Caspian Sea nation is going to the polls a month from now to vote for its president, but calling the process \"an election\" would be a stretch.<br> The incumbent <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3194422.stm\">Ilham Aliyev</a> \u2013 the authoritarian leader who practically inherited the presidency from his father, Heydar Aliyev, in 2003 \u2013 is expected to win the ballot in a landslide and remain in office for another five years. The opposition \u2013 fragmented, embattled, and disillusioned \u2013 announced it would boycott the vote after parliament passed restrictive amendments to Azerbaijan's election law that eliminated even the appearance of a fair process. The amendments cut the campaign period to 75 days before the vote, eliminated state television free air-time for candidates, and denied the opposition equal representation on election commissions \u2013 a key prerequisite to prevent or at least minimise the possibility of fraud. <br> Several opposition politicians later reconsidered and enlisted to run but the key prospective candidates did not. As a result, on October 15, Aliyev will face six virtual unknowns and win without a doubt. Azerbaijanis' \"choice\" will only be a nominal one. In his five years in office, Aliyev Jr has consolidated his position as a supreme executive \u2013 maintaining authority over the cabinet, legislature, the military, and the judiciary. Externally, his centralised regime has been bolstered by the global demand for oil and the west's need for a partner in anti-terrorism. Azerbaijan has strategic importance for both the United States and Europe \u2013 oil in the Caspian Sea provides an alternative to Russian and Persian Gulf supplies, and the west needs a stable partner along Iran's border. These interests have muted international reaction to Azerbaijani authorities' human rights abuses at home. Domestically, critics have been silenced through imprisonment, violence, and intimidation. In a <a href=\"http://www.cpj.org/elmar/\">new report</a> titled \"Finding Elmar's Killers\", the Committee to Protect Journalists finds that Aliyev's success is built to a large extent on his administration's crackdown on the independent media. Television \u2013 the most influential news medium in the country \u2013 is under the administration's control either directly or through pro-Aliyev owners. Low-circulation print media have more editorial freedom, but their impact on public opinion is small. And with the authorities clamping down on critical journalists, fewer reporters are willing to cover sensitive topics, the most dangerous of which is reporting on the president and his family. Disgruntled officials use criminal defamation charges agaisnt journalists frequently, demanding imprisonment and high damages. Compliant courts usually rubberstamp those demands. The government has resisted persistent calls by international organisations, including the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, to decriminalise libel. <br> When Azerbaijan jailed 10 reporters for their work in 2007, it became Europe and Central Asia's leading jailer of journalists, according to CPJ research. Several were later released through a pardon but the most critical ones remained in jail. Those include <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eynulla_Fatullayev\">Eynulla Fatullayev</a>, editor of the now closed independent weekly Realny Azerbaijan, and the brothers Sakit and Genimet Zakhidov with the pro-opposition Azadlyg newspaper. The journalists are serving jail terms on trumped-up charges such as hooliganism, drug possession, and terrorism. CPJ has found those charges to be fabricated and politically motivated.<br> The imprisonment of Eynulla Fatullayev is emblematic of the lengths to which Azerbaijani authorities have gone to stifle independent reporting on sensitive topics. Following his own dogged investigation into the contract-style murder in 2005 of his former boss and mentor, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4315439.stm\">Elmar Huseynov</a>, Fatullayev was slammed with a series of spurious charges \u2013 the heaviest of all being terrorism \u2013 and imprisoned for eight-and-a-half years. Fatullayev had angered the authorities by questioning their will to solve the murder, and reportedly finding and interviewing one of Huseynov's alleged killers.<br> With Fatullayev behind bars, there is no current scrutiny of the official investigation into Huseynov's assassination. The crime remains unsolved and Huseynov's killers are still at large. Following Huseynov's murder, the authorities in Azerbaijan have also failed to investigate severe attacks on at least eight journalists. CPJ interviewed the victims during a week-long trip to Baku in May, recording their disturbing accounts of government indifference, neglect, and, in at least one case, perceived complicity in the attacks.  Huseynov's family members spoke to CPJ of their own disappointment with the official conduct, calling the investigation confusing and secretive at best. Indeed, Azerbaijani authorities have been opaque about their progress towards finding Huseynov's killers. Lately, they have publicly ascribed primary responsibility for arresting the two alleged suspects \u2013 ethnic Azeri Georgian citizens Tair Hubavov and Teymuraz Aliyev \u2013 to Interpol. But the public record does not support that claim, CPJ research found. An official with Aliyev's administration assured CPJ that Azerbaijan remains \"fully committed\" to solving Huseynov's murder. But the public record does not support that assertion either.  The international community is busy \u2013 and rightly so \u2013 moderating the Georgia-Russia crisis and the east-west diplomatic rift it has caused. But we should not forget about Azerbaijan and we should call its government to account on its human rights record. Azer Akhmedov, the acting editor of Azadlyg newspaper told CPJ: \"You know, in a perfect world, it is logical for people to be happy when they have an energy resource. But in Azerbaijan, we say the opposite \u2013 we would be better off if we didn't have oil.\" </p> <p>Akhmedov, whose editor, Genimet Zakhidov, is in jail for \"hooliganism\", told CPJ Azerbaijan is \"cursed\" with by its oil resources and geographic position close to Iran. \"We're stuck between the devil and the deep blue sea,\" he told CPJ. \"We are faced with the reality that human rights are low down on the West's agenda.\" The international community should work to prove Akhmedov wrong \u2013 by demanding the release of all imprisoned journalists, the decriminalisation of libel, the timely and thorough investigation of violence against reporters, and calling on the Azerbaijani government to allow the press to do its job without fear of reprisal. </p> <p><em>Nina Ognianova is Europe and Central Asia Programme Coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists.</em></p>",
  "<p>Any suggestion that it's morbid to talk about John McCain's mortality was mooted by the candidate himself the moment he chose an obviously unqualified running mate. So let's talk.</p> <p>McCain \"released\" his medical records earlier this year. He made 1,000 pages available, which sounds like a lot. But they were released only to a select group of reporters under very specific rules. They had to sit in a room to review them. No electronic devices allowed, so the reporters couldn't email or call medical sources in real time. Making copies to take with them was also verboten.</p> <p>The intrepid documentary filmmaker Robert Greenwald has put together this video:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lvesa49zSIM?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <object width=\"460\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/lvesa49zSIM&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/lvesa49zSIM&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object> </figure>   <p>Yes, he keeps a demanding schedule and all that, but that tells us nothing about what could happen to him two or four years from now. His melanoma diagnosis dates to late 1999 or early 2000. One of the doctors in this piece states that the recurrence rate of McCain's type of melanoma is 66% within 10 years, and it's been eight. Another says that the kind of treatment that would be necessary to deal with a reoccurrence would incapacitate a person for a period of time. </p> <p>Watch the video and, if you're an American, sign the petition if you feel so moved (sorry, no offense/offence, but I don't reckon they want British signatures).

  "<p>Barack Obama and John McCain splashed out millions of dollars in an unprecedented ad campaign spree today in hopes that the Wall Street meltdown will give them a poll boost.</p> <p>Obama paid for an expensive two-minute slot - ads up until now have generally been limited to short 30-second bursts - to be shown nationally on cable television, in particular in the dozen battlefield states.</p> <p>His campaign team senses that Obama rather than McCain stands to benefit from the unsettling impact on voters of the financial collapses.</p> <p>McCain and Obama are deadlocked at present in the polls, a position that has stunned Republicans, given the obstacles faced by McCain, and dismayed Democrats.</p> <p>Obama's chief strategist, David Axelrod, claimed there was \"more urgency\" now about his team as it tries to regain the momentum lost to McCain over the last month.</p> <p>Given that 45% of voters describe the economy as the key issue of the election, the Obama campaign views the crisis as a piece of luck.</p> <p>The Democratic candidate's two-minute ad called for an end to \"the anything goes culture on Wall Street with real regulation that protects your investments and pensions\".</p> <p>McCain also put out a campaign ad, beginning early in the morning, aimed at trying to undo damage caused by his remark on Monday that the US economy was fundamentally strong.</p> <p>He sought to distance himself from George Bush's administration and, as he has all week, blamed corporate greed. He sought to reassure voters. \"Enough is enough,\" he says in the ad. \"I'll meet this financial crisis head on. Reform Wall Street\u2026your savings, your jobs I'll keep them safe.\"</p> <p>Neither Obama nor McCain have a background in economics. Obama has yet to establish a convincing message about how to tackle the economy and the inspirational rhetoric that is his trademark deserts him when he turns to economic matters. McCain long ago admitted he knew little about economics, having specialised in foreign affairs.</p> <p>Neil Newhouse, a Republican pollster, acknowledged today that the Wall Street meltdown should help Obama. But he added the poll advantage will go to \"the first of the two who finds his voice\". The rival teams are awaiting the first polls taken on Monday and Tuesday that will reflect voters' response to events on Wall Street. A Reuters-Zogby poll, released today and taken over the weekend amid rumours of the impending crisis, gave Obama a 2% lead nationally over McCain, 47% to 45%. That wipes out a 5% lead enjoyed by McCain a month ago.</p> <p>Many of the campaign ads put out by Obama and McCain usually receive only limited release, intended mainly for media consumption. It is a sign of how important the two teams judge the present moment that they are prepared to spend big on this occasion. Normally, a candidate would only buy a two-minute slot at the closing stage of a campaign.</p> <p>Both McCain and Obama were careful not to support the Bush administration's bail-out of the insurance giant, AIG. Obama described it as \"the final verdict\" on the failure of the crony capitalism of the last eight years. He said the bail-out should help families that rely on the insurance, not the shareholders or management of AIG.</p> <p>Obama had enjoyed a two-digit lead - 16% in one poll - over McCain on the economy only a few weeks ago and had watched this evaporate to just a few points last week.</p> <p>The seriousness of the crisis has more-or-less led to a temporary halt in negative personal attacks. Republicans, without much enthusiasm, tried to exploit the $9m (\u00a35m) Obama raised at a Hollywood bash on Tuesday night, citing it as evidence of obsession with celebrities. But the issue was drowned out by the latest financial news.</p>",
  "<p>Joe Biden and Sarah Palin are as different as their home states, Delaware and Alaska. Alaska sits in the far northwest corner of North America. Delaware is nestled in the middle of the east coast, halfway between Washington and New York. Alaska is the largest state geographically, while Delaware, where I live, is the second smallest. Even so, Delaware's population is larger.</p> <p>Palin's understanding of the world is as shallow as Biden's is profound. In <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/print?id=5782924\">her first television interview</a>, Palin betrayed her <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/sep/12/sarahpalin.uselections2008\">ignorance of the Bush doctrine</a>, in which our current president declared he would act pre-emptively against state sponsors of terrorism. Charles Gibson of ABC News had to gently explain to her that the doctrine was established by our current president to justify the invasion of Iraq. Palin almost casually mentioned in her interview that she would consider war with Russia as an outcome of the recent conflict with Georgia.</p> <p>In contrast, Biden needs no coaching in the ways of the world. He discussed the options available to the US after returning from a <a href=\"http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/08/joe_biden_to_visit_georgia_thi.php\">visit to Georgia</a> after Russia sent troops there, including i<a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2008/08/amid_vp_buzz_bi.html\">nvoking the terms of the Jackson-Vanik amendment</a>, which affects American trade relations with Russia. Biden didn't need a staffer to explain the meaning of this obscure bit of statecraft, which was adopted in 1974, the year Palin celebrated her tenth birthday. I don't know how relevant Jackson-Vanik is to US-Russian relations, but the point is that Biden does. This is why, when it comes to advising the president when the phone rings, I would much rather have Biden in the situation room than Palin.</p> <p>Of course the election is more about Barack Obama and John McCain than it is about their running mates. But their selections speak volumes about their fitness to serve. McCain picked someone whose ability to excite the Republican base far exceeds her readiness to serve in high office, unless you consider keeping firearms in the house evidence of readiness to keep our country safe. (Palin further displayed her ignorance of foreign affairs by <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/11/AR2008091103789_pf.html\">repeating</a> the long-discredited assertion that <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/2008/09/11/palin-iraq-911/\">Iraq was somehow linked to the al-Qaeda attacks on 9/11</a>.) Obama picked someone whose wide-ranging knowledge of the dangerous world would be invaluable in keeping us safe, especially from those who have not learned from the debacle of the last seven years.</p> <p>A sign in front of a nearby church recently proclaimed: \"God does not call the qualified. He qualifies the called.\" Ours is a religious country. But in our system of government, we don't leave decisions about our governance to the Almighty, but to the citizens. We get to decide who is qualified to govern us. </p> <p>Those eager to pick up the banner of the culture war see Palin as their new standard bearer. But millions of Americans, dismayed at the polarisation of our national life by those whose certainty exceeds their understanding of the world, the emergence of Sarah Palin is frightening.</p>",
  "<p>Lawyers and Republican aides acting on behalf of Sarah Palin are<br>engaged in a fierce legal battle to block an inquiry into the so-<br>called \"Troopergate\" affair, in which the vice-presidential<br>candidate is accused of abusing her public office to wage a<br>personal vendetta against her former brother-in-law.</p> <p>The bi-partisan panel of the Alaskan state legislature in charge of<br>the inquiry is coming under intense pressure to drop the<br>proceedings, or bump them into the long grass until after the<br>November 4 presidential elections. In the latest move, five<br>Republican members of the state assembly have issued a lawsuit<br>seeking to halt the investigation on the grounds that it is<br>\"McCarthyistic, partial and partisan\".</p> <p>Yesterday, the Republican attorney general of Alaska also ruled<br>that 13 witnesses subpoenaed to appear before the inquiry would not<br>have to be honoured.</p> <p>The Democratic head of the panel, Hollis French, has vowed to press<br>on with the inquiry, which is due to report on October 10. In a<br>recent interview with the Guardian he said: \"Sarah Palin's<br>nomination as vice-presidential candidate really doesn't change the<br>steps we are going through to complete the investigation, it just<br>raises its visibility significantly.\"</p> <p>The rapidly escalating campaign of disruption launched by the Palin<br>camp is an indication of how seriously Troopergate is being taken<br>within Republican ranks. Allegations about her misuse of her<br>position as governor of Alaska for personal reasons are potentially<br>damaging to John McCain's presidential hopes as he has billed his<br>running mate as an ethical choice who will combat corruption and<br>cronyism in Washington.</p> <p>At the heart of the affair is the accusation that Palin sacked the<br>head of the Alaskan police service, safety commissioner Walt<br>Monegan, because he refused to take a tough stance against her<br>former brother-in-law who works as a state police officer or<br>trooper. Mike Wooten and Palin's sister Molly were involved in an<br>acrimonious divorce.</p> <p>It has emerged that Palin, her husband Todd and several of her<br>closest aides complained about Wooten to Monegan on at least a<br>dozen occasions, urging him to dismiss the trooper or have him<br>moved. Monegan consistently resisted their advances, until he was<br>himself fired.</p> <p>In an interview with the Wall Street Journal today Monegan<br>said: \"The first thing I said when I was told I was fired was, 'Is<br>it because of Wooten?'\"</p> <p>The union representing Wooten, the Public Safety Employees<br>Association, points out that the trooper was investigated several<br>years ago over alleged improprieties raised by Palin and others,<br>that included the shooting of a cow moose without a proper licence.</p> <p>Wooten was found in breach on some charges and suspended for five<br>days, at which point the case was closed.</p> <p>But soon after Palin became governor in November 2006 the<br>accusations were raised again. In one email to Monegan she wrote:<br>\"Amazing. [Wooten]'s still a trooper, and he still carries a gun,<br>and he still tells anyone who will listen that he will 'never work<br>for that bitch, Palin' because he has such anger and distain (sic)<br>towards my family.\"</p> <p>John Cyr, the union's director, told the Guardian:<br>\"What the governor has done is unconscionable. She has used the<br>bully pulpit of the governor's office to demonise a man who was<br>trying to do his job and raise his family.\"</p> <p>In her defence, Palin says she sacked the police chief not because<br>he refused to act against her former relative, but because he had<br>shown \"insubordination\" towards her over the management of the<br>police budget.</p> <p>Palin has a long track record of blurring the lines between her<br>public and private lives. A recent investigation by the New York<br>Times revealed that as governor she has appointed several former<br>school classmates to senior positions.</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/merrilllynch\">Merrill Lynch</a>'s newly recruited chief executive, John Thain, stands to share a $200m (\u00a3111.4m) payout with two senior lieutenants for less than a year's work which culminated this week in the bank surrendering its 94-year-old independence.</p> <p>The Wall Street bank known as the \"thundering herd\" agreed to a $50bn takeover by Bank of America on Monday after a hasty 48 hours of negotiation. The talks were prompted by fears over banking stability arising from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/lehmanbrothers\">the collapse of Lehman Brothers</a>.</p> <p>Thain, who was previously the head of the New York Stock Exchange, joined Merrill in December with a mandate to steer the bank out of financial trouble. When he arrived, he was given a $15m signing on bonus. If he leaves in Bank of America's takeover, he stands to get a further $11m in accelerated stock payouts.</p> <p>Two former <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/goldmansachs\">Goldman Sachs</a> executives hired by Thain are likely to do even better. Merrill's head of global trading, Thomas Montag, who joined in August, has already received a $39m bonus. Together with stock options accelerated by a buyout, he could end the year with $76m. The bank's head of strategy, Peter Kraus, was given a $95m package including bonuses and stock awards to replace his generous compensation at Goldman when he joined in May, according to figures obtained by Bloomberg News.</p> <p>It is yet to be determined whether any of the trio will have a role at Bank of America. Even by the standards of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/executivesalaries\">Wall Street payouts</a>, the sums are unusually high for such a short period of employment. </p> <p>Steven Hall, a New York-based executive remuneration expert, told the Guardian that Merrill had little choice but to honour the contracts: \"At the time they were recruiting [Thain], a negotiation took place and he would have told them this is what his price was. You can't go back and change things now \u2014 it's almost a kind of buyer's remorse we may be seeing.\"</p> <p>Thain, 53, is a leading fundraiser for the Republican presidential candidate John McCain. A doctor's son, he is an amateur beekeeper who used to keep hives in his back garden. He bought a two-bedroom apartment on New York's Park Avenue two years ago which had an asking price of $27.5m. He was hired by Merrill to steady the ship after huge losses on the credit markets which were run up under the leadership of ousted chief executive Stan O'Neal. </p> <p>At a press conference this week to announce the buyout by Bank of America, Thain admitted that selling Merrill was not the original plan: \"This isn't necessarily the outcome I would have expected when I took the job.\"</p> <p>He insisted that he had made progress in tidying up Merrill: \"We've been consistently cleaning up the balance sheet, repairing the damage that had been done over the last two or three years.\"</p> <p>Thain reportedly fought back tears at a meeting to brief staff on Merrill's buyout this week. Analysts say that Merrill's liabilities were greater than he could have anticipated when he joined \u2014 and some have praised his decision to sell.</p> <p>Defenders of Wall Street's controversial pay packages generally argue that although bankers do well during good times, they hold insecure jobs which are vulnerable during downturns.</p> <p>\"What we do see is that when times get tough, people lose their jobs \u2014 and that's the ultimate in pay cuts,\" said Hall.</p> <p>A Merrill Lynch spokesman said the bank would not comment on executive compensation beyond the statutory disclosures required in filings with regulators.</p>",
  "<p>Sarah Palin may have seen the light - sort of - on climate change but that did not spare her from being singled out today as America's environmental enemy of the year.</p> <p>The Centre for Biological Diversity awarded Palin its Rubber Dodo award for her insistence - despite scientific evidence to the contrary - that the polar bear population was rising across the Arctic.</p> <p>The Arizona thinktank condemned the Alaska governor as a \"global warming denier\".</p> <p>\"Governor Palin has waged a deceptive, dangerous, and costly battle against the polar bear,\" Kieran Suckling, the centre's director, said in a statement. \"Her position on global warming is so extreme, she makes Dick Cheney look like an Al Gore devotee.\"</p> <p>The slap for Palin comes less than a week after she belatedly and grudgingly admitted the possibility of a human factor in climate change in her first television interview since she was chosen as John McCain's running mate.</p> <p>The conversion on climate change was swiftly followed by further revelations of Palin's tenuous relationship to scientific fact. Palin, it appears, is so fond of fake tans that she had a tanning bed installed in the governor's mansion early last year.</p> <p>News reports today said that Palin purchased the used tanning bed from a local health club and moved it into the official residence soon after her election.</p> <p>A few months later, in May 2007, Palin issued a proclamation as governor on skin cancer awareness month urging Alaskans to take preventative measures against the disease.</p> <p>\"Skin cancer is caused, overwhelmingly, by over-exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun and from tanning beds,\" she said in a press release. \"It is largely preventable.\"</p> <p>McCain had tumours causing skin cancer removed in 1993 and 2000, and is religious about using sunscreen and wearing a hat when outdoors.</p>",
  "<p>Staunch Hillary Clinton supporter and fundraiser Lady Lynn Forester de Rothschild has clearly been doing some hard thinking, possibly while travelling between her homes in New York and London and the Rothschild family estate in Buckinghamshire, and has <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/09/17/prominent-clinton-backer-and-dnc-member-to-endorse-mccain-2/\">come to a difficult conclusion</a>: she's going to endorse, and campaign for, John McCain.

  "<p>It may be impossible to sum up in words <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/07/11/ST2008071100041.html\">how purposefully</a> the Bush administration has delayed addressing the threat of climate change. The prospect of a new president who is committed to limiting carbon emissions has <a href=\"http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/15/obama-and-mccain-no-climate-doubt/\">sparked new hope</a> that the US can come back from the brink of environmental laxity.</p> <p>And today we see another potential sign of positive change on the horizon. <br><br>The US environmental protection agency, the same body that was <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=massachusetts+versus+epa&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a\">dragged into court</a> for dragging its feet on climate policy, has named Deborah Swackhamer the new chief of its Science Advisory Board (SAB), the independent panel that gives advice on the impact of government regulations.</p> <p>Happily, Swackhamer <a href=\"http://www.minnpost.com/sharonschmickle/2008/01/18/611/global_warmings_pressing_moral_question\">is a strong proponent</a> of sacrifice and conservation to control emissions.</p> <p>\"We can't afford to wait,\" the University of Minnesota water resources scientist said earlier this year. \"We must make these changes now for our children to see an impact.\"</p> <p>The SAB was plagued during the first year of the Bush administration by allegations of corruption and conflicts of interest among its ostensibly independent members. Swackhamer's two-year appointment is an encouraging sign -- particularly if the next president and his advisers pay her perspective more heed than that of her predecessor, M Granger Morgan of Carnegie Mellon university, who <a href=\"http://www.innovations-report.de/html/berichte/umwelt_naturschutz/bericht-74550.html\">has long urged</a> the Bush administration to act on climate change.</p>",

  "<p>Nick Clegg's first annual conference speech as Liberal Democrat leader was today hailed by party grandees and delegates alike as sending a clear message to ordinary people that the party is \"on their side\".</p> <p>Clegg's relaxed style, delivering the speech while walking around the stage, was praised for its contrast to the more formal approach of his predecessor, Sir Menzies Campbell.</p> <p>The party president, Simon Hughes, said the speech, at the end of five days of debate in Bournemouth, had addressed \"the concerns of real Britons, of real people, of real families who are facing a very uncertain time\".</p> <p>Hughes, who acknowledged the party had been through a turbulent period because of recent leadership contests to replace Campbell and Charles Kennedy, said Clegg was a more effective communicator than his predecessors.</p> <p>\"The truth of the matter is that Nick is much more comfortable as a communicator in his way than any of his predecessors. He is a great communicator \u2014 that is why we chose him as leader.\"</p> <p>Sir Menzies said the speech was a \"testament to Nick Clegg's liberalism\".</p> <p>He said: \"I'm pretty certain he has got all the qualities necessary to make sure that the progress he described and defined is going to be achieved.\"</p> <p>Clegg had a \"more relaxed style of talking to people directly\" in the \"modern way\" rather than delivering a declaration from a lectern, Sir Menzies said.</p> <p>Former party leader Lord Ashdown described Clegg's address as a \"tour de force\". </p> <p>\"It was exceptional as a first speech,\" he said. \"If you compare it to my first speech [as leader] in Blackpool I think it was a real tour de force. I think the party is his now. You know a clear leader when he knows where he wants to take the party and takes the people with him. He has really done it.\"</p> <p>The environment spokesman, Steve Webb, said: \"I thought it was very powerful. It was a unifying speech. We come from a range of traditions and emphases, and I thought Nick pushed the button for everybody.\"</p> <p>The home affairs spokesman, Chris Huhne, who was defeated by Mr Clegg in the contest for the leadership, added: \"It was an inspirational speech.</p> <p>\"It was the culmination of a splendid conference which has really set a very clear sense of direction for the party.</p> <p>\"Nick has staked out the battleground for the next election, which is now that Labour is finished as a political force where is the choice for British people going to be?</p> <p>\"And it has been staked out between a party that believes in fairness, wants to give people more of their own money for lower income earners and middle income earners, and not, like the Conservatives, only the top 6% of income earners.</p> <p>\"It was a rallying cry for a crusade for real change at the next election.\"</p> <p>The Lib Dems' health spokesman, Norman Lamb, said Clegg defined the party as the champion of social justice. \"The assertion that we are the only party capable of delivering social justice is a bold one but it is the right case to be made because Labour has ultimately failed.\"</p> <p>The family spokeswoman, Susan Kramer, said the speech captured the concerns of her constituents, her neighbours, and her friends. \"I thought that was the best leader's speech I have heard,\" she said. </p> <p>\"It was really important to re-emphasise the tax cutting agenda. It recognises what people are going through.\"<br> Delegates were also wooed by the speech. Lib Dem delegate Marion Bland, a councillor from Litchfield, Staffs, said: \"It contained all the aspects I wanted him to discuss. I do not agree with everything though, because I am on the left of the party.\"</p> <p>She added: \"I agree with the tax cuts but I would like anything that is left over to go into public services.\"</p> <p>Michael Peacock, from Godalming in Surrey, said Clegg's address was the best speech he had ever heard. \"It was very honest and it hit all the right buttons.\"</p> <p>Jenny Barnes, also from Godalming, said: \"I had seen some reports claiming he has presented himself as to the right of the Conservatives, but he has definitely positioned us as the party of social justice, which is how I saw the tax cutting move.\"</p> <p>David Brown, a councillor from Poole, said: \"He stated all the important things that we believe in as Liberal Democrats, particularly on the economy issues, and the solutions that we are proposing to solve the difficulties. Other parties do not seem to have a clue about that. I like the tax cut plans. It is what is needed at the moment.\"</p>",
  "<p>Hillary Clinton has backed out of a planned rally against the Iranian government after learning that protest organisers also invited Sarah Palin.</p> <p>The rally in New York on Monday is sponsored by a coalition of US Jewish groups angered by Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's presence at the opening of the UN general assembly.</p> <p>But the protest plan went awry after Clinton, a longtime ally of pro-Israel groups, discovered that the Republican vice-presidential nominee had also been asked to attend.</p> <p>Clinton aides said they learnt of Palin's invitation from the media, not the rally organisers. \"Her attendance was news to us, and this was never billed to us as a partisan political event,\" a spokesman for the former first lady told the Associated Press.</p> <p>A joint appearance by Clinton and Palin would have drawn intense interest, particularly given lingering questions over how strongly the New York senator has criticised Palin while campaigning for Barack Obama.</p> <p>The rally also would have lent Palin some of Clinton's formidable appeal to Jewish voters. The Republican No 2 has struggled to <a href=\"http://www.jewishjournal.com/elections/article/mccain_team_palin_rejects_views_of_churchs_jews_for_jesus_speaker_20080903\">beat back scepticism</a> over her attendance at a church service that featured controversial remarks about terrorism in Israel.</p> <p>The Clinton cancellation now leaves Palin the main draw at Monday's event, after which she is expected to make introductions to foreign leaders with running mate John McCain at her side. </p> <p>President George Bush is slated to address the UN gathering on Tuesday.</p> <p>When asked about the Iran rally, Republican spokeswoman Tracy Schmitt sent a subtle jab at Clinton \u2013 whom Palin criticised earlier this year but has now taken to praising as she courts female voters.</p> <p>\"Governor Palin believes that the danger of a nuclear Iran is greater than party or politics,\" Schmitt told Fox News. \"She hopes that all parties can rally together in opposition to this grave threat.\"</p>",
  "<p>Obama has gathered support among female and independent voters who, following the tumultuous nature of the US financial markets over the past few days, have seen him as the candidate best able to manage the current dire state of the economy. He now leads McCain among likely voters by 47% to 45%.</p> <p>Over the past two days <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/17/uselections2008.barackobama\">McCain has been flailing</a> as he attempted to justify his claim that despite one of the most dramatic weeks Wall Street, the ''fundamentals of our economy are strong''. </p> <p>This error of judgement \u2013 along with the masses of coverage on the ramifications of the Lehmann brothers collapse - has put the Palin 'phenomenon' distinctly on the backburner.</p> <p>In high-mode damage control McCain has appeared on six morning television shows in the US, explaining that what he meant was apparently in reference to the fundamentals of America\u2026 \"which is the workers, their productivity, their innovation, their incredible performance for many, many years.\"</p> <p>The ''excess and greed'' of Wall Street had ''betrayed'' the American working class, he added.</p> <p>Obama has used McCain's 'fundamentals of the economy are strong' assurances to show how out of touch the Republican candidate is, not only with those suffering on Wall Street but the general public.</p> <p>A series of advertisements released by the Democrats quote McCain effectively saying everything is fine, at the same time as headlines <br>\"Lehman Brothers Collapses'', \"Markets in Turmoil'' and \"Foreclosures at 9.800 a day''.</p> <p>A final word perhaps to one of Obama's people, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/deadlineusa/2008/sep/16/uselections2008.johnmccain\">in reference to a claim yesterday that John McCain had created the BlackBerry</a>, who pointed out: </p> <p>\"If McCain hadn't said 'the fundamentals of our economy are strong' on the day of one of our nation's worst financial crises, the claim that he invented the BlackBerry would have been the most preposterous thing he said all week.''</p>",
  "<p>With George Bush looking on, financial institutions gobbled up risky loans that built into a crescendo of debt. The ensuing crisis prompted a bailout from Congress and cost US taxpayers billions of dollars.</p> <p>It sounds like America's current economic struggle \u2013 but that was the reality 19 years ago, during a mass failure of savings-and-loan thrifts, or S&amp;Ls, that rivalled the financial collapse of the Great Depression.</p> <p>John McCain has admitted that his role in the Keating Five scandal, the most notorious chapter in the S&amp;L crisis, \"will be on my tombstone\". Months before he was singed by Keating, however, <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=101&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00166\">joined fellow Republicans</a> to rebel against a congressional rescue for failing S&amp;Ls.</p> <p>\"We all hope he learned his lesson from that previous go-round,\" Barry Bosworth, a senior fellow in economics at the Brookings Institution, said. \"I do think he was on the wrong side back in the S&amp;L crisis.\"</p> <p>The Republican nominee was one of five senators who intervened with banking officials in 1987 on behalf of Charles Keating, a McCain friend and contributor who hoped to quash a government audit of his S&amp;L. The thrift's eventual collapse deprived thousands of their life savings.</p> <p>\"If you kept institutions around that were fundamentally flawed,\" Bosworth said, likening the S&amp;L quandary to the current crisis, \"they were gambling and hoping to get a big win. That carries over to their competitors and the problem spreads to the whole system.\"</p> <p>The Keating scandal broke in 1989, causing a media firestorm and an ethics investigation of McCain. But months before his troubles began, McCain voted to keep an S&amp;L rescue plan off the US budget \u2013 saving Republicans from being saddled with a higher national debt.</p> <p>In addition to making the S&amp;L rescue more expensive, the Republican tactic \"had the very real potential to disrupt and delay\" relief, according to a 2006 Bush administration analysis. The plan ultimately passed, creating a government-run Resolution Trust Corporation that managed the assets of defunct S&amp;Ls to minimise taxpayer losses.</p> <p>One of Resolution's first moves was to sue Charles Keating and his business partners for $1.1bn.</p> <p>McCain's willingness to delay an S&amp;L fix is newly relevant this week, as senior Democrats <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/15/AR2008091503302.html?hpid=topnews\">propose a similar remedy</a> to manage the books of financial institutions hit hard by the credit crunch.</p> <p>John Irons, research director at the Economic Policy Institute, said \"I'd be surprised if he got on board with\" a Resolution-type entity to resolve the current crisis, \"given his history of opposing regulation in the past.</p> <p>\"He keeps saying something needs to be done,\" Irons added, \"but every time something comes up it seems like something he wouldn't support. He seems to have taken a personal lesson from the [Keating] scandal, but not necessarily any policy lesson.\"</p> <p>Obama invoked the spectre of Keating yesterday, listing the dire economic consequences of the S&amp;L crisis and asking a Colorado audience: \"Does that sound familiar?\"</p> <p>McCain himself <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/19/us/politics/19campaign.html\">made a similar comparison</a> between risky S&amp;L investments and risky subprime investments last year.</p> <p>The Republican nominee again harkened back to the 1980s yesterday, blaming the credit crisis on bad behaviour by Wall Street. He also blasted lax financial regulators, vowing to \"reduce the debt and risk\" of banks affected by mortgage defaults.</p> <p>Such rhetoric masks McCain's unchanged support for minimal financial oversight, University of Texas economics professor James Galbraith said.</p> <p>\"He's in favour of doing what the [financial] lobbies want to do,\" Galbraith said. \"When there's a big blow-up, they tend to blame it on bad people; therefore, we're going to clean up the mess on Wall Street, get rid of the bad CEOs \u2013 find a scapegoat and go hide in the deep brushes.\"</p> <p>Galbraith observed that McCain has taken his economic-policy cues from Phil Gramm, a longtime friend and the former co-chairman of his presidential campaign. Gramm stepped aside earlier this year after calling the US \"a nation of whiners\" but remains a McCain cheerleader.</p> <p>Gramm led the 1989 rebellion against counting the S&amp;L rescue on the budget. Ten years later, he was the singular force behind a financial deregulation plan that many scholars believe laid the groundwork for this year's subprime debacle.</p> <p>\"The guy was systematically in the forefront of creating ways in which bad operators could make money and escape supervision,\" Galbraith said.</p> <p>McCain's past reliance on Gramm for economic counsel can be attributed to his relative lack of experience with financial issues. He <a href=\"http://elections.foxnews.com/2008/01/27/hitting-home-mccain-romney-attack-records-on-economy-iraq\">said in January</a> that mortgage issues are not his strong suit.</p> <p>\"If they choose to say, 'Look, I do not need this guy because he's not as good on home loan mortgages' or whatever it is, I understand about that, I will accept that verdict,\" McCain told a Florida audience. \"I am running because of the transcendental challenge of the 21st century, which is radical Islamic extremism.\"</p>",
  "<p>If <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/17/labour.labourleadership\">David Miliband</a> becomes Labour's leader some time in the next few weeks, British voters will be offered a choice at the next election between three nice, very clever, youngish men. </p> <p>All three were educated at Oxbridge. All three have neat, short hair; they wear dark suits in the week, jeans and fleeces at the weekend; they are married to interesting, independent partners and have young children. Two of the three do not believe in God, and the third is equivocal about it. </p> <p>All three of them take cultured holidays in sunny parts of Europe, where they eat nice food and read clever books. They probably cook well at home. They listen to classical music, but like rock too. One was brought up in Notting Hill and another lives there (more or less). They are cagey about past drug use. They are not short of money. They are rationalists. </p> <p>Each of them claims to be progressive, green, tolerant, up to speed with the digital age and tired of what they like to call \"the old politics\". They like markets, but regulated ones. They think the poor and workless should be helped, but not indulged. They believe in the power of education. </p> <p>To the few people who know all three personally, the differences between them are obvious. To everyone else, David Miliband, David Cameron and Nick Clegg are variants of the same creature, so similar that they could swap homework, swap speeches, swap families \u2013 even swap jobs \u2013 and no one would really notice. </p> <p>What they lack is experience. Which is where Vincent Cable comes in. There has been something of a cult around Vince in Bournemouth this week, which is partly the sort of silly thing that happens at party conferences but which also, I think, ties into something deeper. </p> <p>Danny Finkelstein puts his finger on it in his <a href=\" http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/daniel_finkelstein/article4768827.ece\">Times column today</a>: Cable has seen and done things in his life, which deepen and improve him as a politician now. His party shied from making him leader because they thought him too old, as he told an Observer fringe meeting here last night:</p> <p>They made the mistake of believing Menzies Cambell, whose failure as a leader was excused by his age, when really the problem was that he was no good. Cable is good, and his long life is part of it.</p> <p>Experience is discounted as an asset in British politics; almost everywhere else it is prized. Experience, or the lack of it, is the leading issue in the US election: Obama and Palin, offset by their running mates Biden and McCain. British parties offer no such balanced ticket here.</p> <p>Maybe the problem is that British politicians do have experience but want to hide it, or are embarrassed by what they were. Gordon Brown has deleted several of his pasts: Scottish radical; New Labour young Turk; obstructionist chancellor. He looks both old and empty at the end of a life of evasion: he promised prudence and to avoid bust, and that experience is no help to him now.</p> <p>Cable \u2013 older than Brown \u2013 feels he has nothing to hide from, as last night's fascinating discussion showed. Questioned by journalist Andrew Rawnsley, Cable described things that for Clegg, Cameron and Miliband are history: persuading a racist father to come to terms with his non-white bride, against the backdrop of Enoch Powell's speeches. Standing for Labour in a safe Tory seat in Glasgow (unthinkable now) in the 1970 election. Running the post-colonial Kenyan economy as a senior but young advisor, and being spellbound by Jomo Kenyatta, as he describes here in answer to a question from Rawnsley about post-independence Africa:</p> <p>Cable wrote (with a hairy Gordon Brown) part of the Red Papers on Scotland, a radical tract. He protested outside the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders. He was John Smith's special advisor. He was chief economist of Shell Oil. </p> <p>He also witnessed \u2013 as a Labour party member before fleeing to the SDP \u2013 the awfulness of the civil war that engulfed Labour in the 1980s. \"You do need stamina\", he said last night, describing the 27-year gap between his first attempt to enter parliament and his eventual election:</p> <p>Clegg and Miliband got in on their first attempt; Cameron on his second. All of them may become their party's leaders on a sort of accelerated trainee scheme, raised up before their time by the failure of the failure of senior generations (Brown, Kennedy, Cambell and all those squabbling Tories).</p> <p>\"I learned by doing,\" Cable said (which is one reason that his warnings about where the current financial crisis may end up are taken seriously):</p> <p>The problem with politics is that few other participants can say the same.</p>",
  "<p>So I was abed this morning listening to NPR and on comes Mara Liasson with a report about the women's vote. Typical silly evenhandedness, and then she plays a snippet from a McCain-Palin radio commercial that sums up the whole problem, really.</p> <p>The commercial is about the \"sexist\" attacks on Palin. The script is read of course in a woman's voice, and she conveys just the right tone of anger and contempt for the sneering hypocritical liberal elite misogynists. They tried A, and B, and C, the woman says. And then, when that didn't work, \"they called her a liar.\" She brands this \"despicable.\"</p> <p>Okay. I spent yesterday afternoon fretting that Obama's message was too muddled, not pointed enough. Almost everyone I know thinks this. Maybe we're right. Or maybe we're just compulsive fretters, because that's what liberals tend to be based on experience.</p> <p>So maybe the Obama team is flailing. But now I hear this ad and I think, how do you fight an opponent that not only lies, but then tells lies about the lies?</p> <p> </p> <p>Palin is a liar. Of this there's no question. She supported the bridge to nowhere. She asked for earmarks as governor \u2013 and not just one or two, but $453 million worth. She still goes around the country saying the exact opposite of both of these things. To adoring supporters, natch, who care nothing about what the truth of the matter is, only that she's sticking it to the liberal-elite man.</p> <p>Eugene Robinson <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/15/AR2008091502471.html\">summed this up nicely yesterday</a> in his Wash Post column. Palin, he explained, did sort of 'fess up about the bridge in her Charlie Gibson interview. But a few days later, she was back out on the trail saying the same thing.</p> <p>Robinson:</p> <blockquote> <p>What kind of person tells a self-aggrandizing lie, gets called on it, admits publicly that the truth is not at all what she originally claimed -- and then goes out and starts telling the original lie again without changing a word?</p> </blockquote> <p>Yesterday, John McCain talked about the need for reform on Wall Street, vowing that his administration will crack down on the shysters and the greedhogs. Sure. Virtually every chance he's had, he's supporting lifting regulations. Today the Wash Post <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/16/AR2008091603732.html\">has the goods</a> and places them on the front page. McCain wants to \"tap into\" populist anger, writes the paper:</p> <blockquote> <p>But his past support of congressional deregulation efforts and his arguments against \"government interference\" in the free market by federal, state and local officials have given Sen. Barack Obama an opening to press the advantage Democrats traditionally have in times of economic trouble. </p> </blockquote> <p>And, today, I can guarantee you, McCain spokespeople and spinners will tell reporters and cable TV hosts that this obviously true documented record is nonsense and McCain has always been an opponent of such excess.</p> <p>Again, in both cases, these aren't just lies. They're lies about lies. That's a really different thing. In life, a typical person lies. If they get caught \u2013 hopefully, they tender an apology; at the very least they stop telling the lie. But here we have a case where the liars not only don't do either of those things. They just keep on lying. </p> <p>But wait, there's more! Because it isn't only that they lie and then lie about the lies. They follow that by playing the victim, claiming that the allegation from the other people that they're lying is nonsense, or a sign that they're part of the Washington establishment, or \"despicable.\" </p> <p>Imagine this happening in your own life. You knew your spouse was cheating, and she or he kept on denying it and called you despicable. Imagine that in a court of law, a plaintiff or defendant's attorney could lie, get caught, lie again and then get at least some members of the jury to believe that the allegations that he lied were just an elitist plot. That in business, one party could break a contract, lie about it, lie about having lied about it, charge that the other party's willingness to stand by the original terms of the contract showed only that the other party was weak and inflexible -- and still come out of the deal smelling sweet.</p> <p>Other campaigns have lied, and yes, Democratic ones as well as Republican. But none I've ever covered has lied like this one and told lies about the lies and then gone and played the victim to its base voters and then, as a parting shot, shut off all serious press inquiries so that it didn't really have to answer any difficult questions about its lies. John McCain, of \"straight talk\" fame, hasn't spoken with the reporters on his plane in more than a month. </p> <p>So what are the Obama people supposed to do in the face of this? I honestly don't know. You can try to persuade a few figures of authority with some bipartisan credential to step forward and call lies lies, but most such people will be chary of doing that. Or maybe you can get down in the gutter. It's certainly what they deserve.</p> <p>But you can't have an argument with people who play according to these rules. They enforce no code of decency upon themselves, and no one exists to enforce it. The \"objective\" media? Stop joking. They're powerless to stop it; all they really do, as NPR did this morning, is give more air time to the victim-playing about the lies about the lies. We're down the rabbit hole. If these people win, we'll be in a worse place than that.</p>",
  "<p>Back in July, I wrote here that the US presidential race between Barack Obama and John McCain stood a good chance of being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/02/usa.uselections2008\">the first post-culture-war campaign</a>. What can I say? I was 180 degrees wrong.</p> <p>McCain's selection of Sarah Palin as his running mate has reignited the US culture wars, and they seem to be burning hotter and brighter than ever. Palin is a polarizing figure straight out of the national id. She opposes abortion rights, questions Darwin and the human connection to global warming, and brims with self-confidence <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/16/opinion/16brooks.html?_r=1&amp;em&amp;oref=slogin\">despite lacking knowledge or experience</a>. She drives Democrats crazy and thrills the GOP base, which was decidedly not thrilled with McCain.</p> <p>The McCain campaign has gone all-out to exploit these ideological fault lines. It has attacked the media as an out-of-touch elite for questioning Palin's fitness for office and asking <a href=\"http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=09&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=dont_know_much_about_energy\">legitimate questions about her record</a>. It has launched a series of culture-based attacks on Obama touching on sex and celebrity. </p> <p>Obviously, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/15/AR2008091502406.html?hpid=opinionsbox1\">like many people</a>, I misjudged McCain. I expected him to argue for his candidacy on the merits and believed that he could articulate a coherent argument against Obama. America is clearly at a turning point \u2013 the economy is foundering, US influence in the world is declining, and the nation has effectively put off dealing with global warming, the energy crisis, health care and a host of other brewing problems. Yet at the Republican convention in St Paul, McCain's campaign manager Rick Davis <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2008/09/mccain_manager_this_election_i.html\">declared</a> that \"this election is not about issues,\" but about a \"composite view\" of the candidates \u2013 in other words, character. </p> <p>If McCain wins, his campaign strategy will turn out to be a giant missed opportunity. Campaigns are opportunities to field-test proposals and themes for the coming four years and build public support for action. This is what Obama's doing. But McCain isn't making much of a positive argument for himself, beyond a few buzzwords like \"maverick.\" Especially on domestic issues, we have virtually no clue what his priorities are, what he wants to do in office.</p> <p>Even on its own terms, McCain's culture war campaign is a scattershot, unfocused and largely mendacious affair. McCain ads have attacked Obama for being a lightweight celebrity, for wanting to teach sex education to kindergarteners (not true), for calling Palin a \"pig\" (also not true). </p> <p>Past GOP culture-war campaigns were negative, divisive and personal. But they made coherent arguments. When George HW Bush attacked Michael Dukakis as an out-of-the-mainstream liberal in 1988, he had a point. Dukakis was a traditional liberal during a time of conservative ascendancy. And the main points of attack were <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Horton\">based on facts</a>: Dukakis did nominally oversee the prison furlough programme that released a killer who then raped and assaulted a woman. He did <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEEDB1F3EF936A1575BC0A96E948260\">veto a bill</a> requiring the Pledge of Allegiance to the US flag be recited in Massachusetts public schools. In 2004, George W Bush's denunciations of John Kerry as a liberal Washington insider who had trouble articulating clear positions also had the ring of truth.</p> <p>Those campaigns were slick and sophisticated attempts to shape public opinion. By contrast, McCain's ads and rhetoric sound like they're generated by <a href=\"http://www.brianbeutler.com/2008/09/john_mccain_no/\">a bunch of twentysomething Republican bloggers</a>, strung out on caffeine at 3am, each trying to out-snark all the others. The main thing the campaign has going for it is sheer outrageousness \u2013 that is, by hitting every conceivable cultural hot button and <a href=\"http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2008/09/thanks_but_no_thanks.php\">repeating untruths</a> over and over, it will both get an anti-Obama message out and also dominate the news cycle.</p> <p>So far, it's worked \u2013 McCain now has a slight edge in the polls. And the Obama campaign has fumbled, spending much of its time lamely responding to the latest McCain attack. </p> <p>But it's far from clear the culture war will carry McCain to victory. The political fundamentals \u2013 the US economic doldrums and widespread displeasure with the Republican party \u2013 still favor Obama. For many voters worried about their own financial security, those issues will eclipse cultural hot buttons, many of which are remnants of the 1960s and increasingly irrelevant to the challenges of life in 21st century America. </p> <p>It will also be hard for McCain to keep up his current tactics for six weeks straight in the face of mounting media criticism. Presidential campaigns, especially close ones, are notoriously volatile. Polls and the media \"narrative\" can shift dramatically in a short space of time. Even \"outrageous\" can get old fast.</p>",
  "<p>My trip begins today as I fly to Washington DC. It won't be in a beautiful plane like this but a standard issue 747. This plane hangs in the British Science Museum, and one of the things I was reading at the airport was a survey of the positions of Barack Obama and John McCain on science, education and innovation. The New York Times has a good summary of the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/16/science/16science.html?_r=1&amp;ref=science&amp;oref=slogin\">candidates' stances on the science issues</a>, but you can get the full monty at <a href=\"http://www.sciencedebate2008.com/\">Science Debate 2008</a>.</p> <p>Of course, the big news this morning is the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/17/aig.insurance.wallstreet\">US government bailout of insurance giant AIG</a>. It's really difficult to get a sense how this turmoil on Wall Street will impact Main Street, but CNN has an overview of how the crisis at <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2008/09/16/news/companies/aig_questions/index.htm\">AIG impacts insurance policy holders and others</a> in the broader economy. It all goes back to the sub-prime crisis.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"In the past nine months, AIG has reported net losses of more than $18 billion, largely due to its exposure to bad mortgages.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>John McCain has been ... ahem ... <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/17/us/politics/17mccain.html?hp\">'recalibrating' his economic message</a>.</p> <p>The post-convention bounces have settled out with John McCain having a slight advantage, but the race is still very close. But election analyst <a href=\"http://www.cookpolitical.com/\">Charlie Cook</a> sees the <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/njonline/ot_20080916_7805.php\">economic turmoil as giving Obama a bit of a space</a> to change the momentum:<br></p> <blockquote> <p><br>\"While managing the economy is not exactly Obama's strong suit, it does pull the focus even further away from national security, McCain's strength. It would seem a better bet that this jump ball would be more likely go toward the team that hasn't been in power, and the edge would go to Obama.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Well, gotta dash, and I'm in the air for the next seven hours.

  "<p>This is a wild claim, but I think it's true. If you've got <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/more4/\">More4</a>, and you've never heard of Jon Stewart - I'm about to improve your life.</p> <p>Watch <a href=\"http://www.thedailyshow.com/\">The Daily Show with Jon Stewart</a>. In the UK it's normally on every night, from Monday to Friday, at 8.30pm, after transmission in the US. Trust me. Just watch it. It really is superb.</p> <p>And you should definitely tune in this Friday (or tomorrow, if you live in the US) because Tony Blair is going to be on and it could be a cracker.</p> <p>If you know the programme, you'll probably understand why I'm raving like a lunatic. If you haven't seen it, I expect you're trying to work out why anyone could get so excited about a talk show.</p> <p>But the point about the Daily Show is that it isn't just a comedy programme. It is gloriously funny \u2013 Stewart was praised in a Guardian leader earlier this month which concluded <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/08/television.usa\">\"no comedian alive offers quite the same joyful, cathartic dose of satire as does the 45-year-old New Yorker\"</a> - but the real reason why it's become cult viewing is because its analysis is so incisive.</p> <p>The US journalist Thomas Friedman pointed this out last year, in a column in which he tried to imagine how an Iranian spy would report back to Tehran on <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/05/opinion/05friedman.html\">life in the US</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>We have to note that obtaining open-source intelligence in America has become more difficult, because traditional news shows have become more comedic and more comedic news shows more authoritative.</p> <p>For instance, CNN's nightly business report is hosted by a man named \"Dobbs\". Real journalists come on his show and present transparently propagandistic stories about immigration and trade and then he fulminates about them, much the way our ayatollahs used to do about \"Satanic Americans\" on late-night Iranian TV. So viewers have no real idea what's happening in the US economy.</p> <p>Meanwhile, at 11 pm, something called The Daily Show, which appears on Comedy Central, has fake journalists presenting what turns out to be the real news.</p> </blockquote> <p>This helps to explain why the New York Times recently described Stewart as \"the most trusted man in America\". It also explains why guests like Barack Obama, John McCain, and Bill and Hillary Clinton are willing to appear, even at the risk of being mocked. Stewart's even had a head of state on the show, Pervez Musharraf when he was president of Pakistan.</p> <p>Blair has never been on the show before and he's accepted the invitation because it coincides with the start of the faith and globalisation course he's teaching at Yale University. </p> <p>Stewart is never overtly offensive to his guests. But he can expose their weaknesses brilliantly and he's obsessed with what went wrong in \"Mess O'Potamia\". Blair might have some explaining to do. As you can guess, I'll be glued to the screen.</p>",
  "<p>Kanye West may have an ego the size of a blimp, but he too seems susceptible to criticism. Less than a week after the rapper/producer released his new song, Love Lockdown, online, he is already re-recording it.</p> <p>The new recording is understood to have taken place in Hawaii, after Kanye posted bail from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/sep/12/kanye.west\">a scuffle with Los Angeles paparazzi</a>.</p> <p>\"Your prayers have been answered!\" Kanye wrote on his blog. \"There's a new version of Love Lockdown coming. We used new taiko drums and I re-sung it... it's being mastered now ... \" </p> <p>It remains to be seen whether Japanese taiko drums will be enough to redeem a track roundly scorned by hip-hop fans across the 'net. Rather than rally behind the MTV Video Music Awards-premiered song, fans were bewildered by its diffuse, auto-tuned style.</p> <p>\"There must not be anyone in Kanye's inner circle or in the Def Jam building with both the cojones and the authority to tell Kanye West that ... Love Lockdown should [never] have been released,\" <a href=\"http://www.byroncrawford.com/2008/09/kanye-west-love.html\">wrote influential hip-hop blogger Byron Crawford</a>. \"The result is a song so awful I'm wondering if radio stations are even gonna be able to pretend that it's good enough to put into heavy rotation.\"</p> <p>His comments were echoed by a <a href=\"http://theunderwriters.blogspot.com/2008/09/breaking-news-zapp-roger-are-dead.html\">critic at the Underwriter blog</a>. \"Ask me about any other song Kanye has produced and/or performed; I'll probably defend it as either great, good or misunderstood. This one is just weird, and seems similar to the news of [Governor Sarah] Palin being picked [by John McCain] for VP, not very well planned out and intended for shock value. ... Speaking of which, where's the rap? Eff that, where's the beat?\"</p> <p>Even 50 Cent - whom Kanye soundly trounced in a chart battle last year, - was able to score some points, mocking Love Lockdown with an out of tune rendition in Albany, NY. </p> <p>But at least when it comes to the autotune, Kanye is unrepentant. \"If you don't like auto-tune,\" he wrote on his blog, \"too bad cause I love it and have been using it since the College Dropout!!!\"</p> <p>Extra exclamation marks aren't going to be able to save this one, sir.</p>",
