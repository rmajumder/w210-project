  "<p>The woman who had an extramarital affair with the former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards has ruled out a paternity test for her baby daughter.</p> <p>Rielle Hunter's lawyer said she was a \"private\" person, who was \"not running for public office\" and said she would not allow a test \"now or in the future\".</p> <p>\"She wishes to maintain her privacy and her daughter's privacy,\" the lawyer's statement said. \"Furthermore, Rielle will not participate in DNA testing or any other invasion of her or her daughter's privacy now or in the future.\"</p> <p>Confirmation of the affair, which had been reported by National Enquirer magazine for months, came in a pre-recorded ABC television interview broadcast on Friday evening and in a statement released by the former North Carolina senator.</p> <p>The 2004 Democratic vice-presidential candidate said he would be ready to take a paternity test to settle the fatherhood of the five-month-old girl, whose California birth certificate does not name a father.</p> <p>\"I am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that I am not the father of any baby. I am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established,\" the statement said. Edwards said he made \"a serious error in judgment\" in 2006 and added: \"Being 99% honest is no longer enough.\"</p> <p>During his campaigning, Edwards had made much of the strength of his marriage to his wife of 30 years, Elizabeth, who was diagnosed with cancer in March last year. He blamed his political celebrity when asked in the TV interview how he could have embarked on an affair.</p> <p>\"All of which fed a self-focus, an egotism that leads you to believe you can do whatever you want,\" he told ABC's Bob Woodruff. \"You're invincible. And there will be no consequences. And nothing, nothing could be further from the truth.\"</p> <p>The truth, which had been dismissed as \"tabloid trash\" just days earlier by Edwards, was revealed in a classic sting by the magazine, which photographed Edwards visiting Hunter at the Beverly Hilton hotel. Edwards was forced to hide in a toilet for 15 minutes with reporters shouting questions through the door.</p> <p>Hunter was hired in July last year by the Edwards campaign as a video-maker, receiving $114,000 (\u00a360,000), despite having little film experience. The couple met at a Manhattan restaurant in 2006.</p>",
  "<p>Robert Mugabe and Morgan Tsvangirai were locked in make-or-break talks last night over how power will be distributed in a coalition government aimed at ending Zimbabwe's deepening political and economic crisis. </p> <p>The two sides have reached broad agreement that Mugabe will remain president and Tsvangirai will be prime minister at the head of a large cabinet divided evenly between their two parties, but with a smaller opposition faction holding the balance of posts.</p> <p>Sources close to the talks, mediated by South Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki, said there remained significant differences over key issues that will decide whether Mugabe retains real control of the government, in effect overturning Tsvangirai's victory in the March presidential election. </p> <p>Mbeki was pushing for an agreement that would not only resolve Zimbabwe's crisis but permit him to claim that his strategy of quiet diplomacy, derided in the west as a failure, was ultimately successful.</p> <p>In June, Mbeki proposed that Mugabe remain as a titular president, after 28 years in total control, with executive powers transferred to Tsvangirai as prime minister. Mugabe went into yesterday's meeting determined not to cede most of his powers, while Tsvangirai argued that he won a mandate to govern from the people in the March election - the last one widely considered to be largely legitimate. </p> <p>Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) said before the talks that while it would accept Mugabe in a ceremonial role, if he were to retain significant powers it would reward his Zanu-PF party's campaign of killings, beatings, abductions and rapes that broke opposition support in a second round of elections in June.</p> <p>Among the other issues in dispute is the composition of the cabinet. Mugabe wants it to have 36 ministers, with Zanu-PF and the MDC holding 15 seats each and the remaining six held by a breakaway faction of the MDC headed by Arthur Mutambara. Tsvangirai wants a smaller cabinet and Mutambara to have only two seats. </p> <p>Zanu-PF is keen for a large number of cabinet seats in part because party leaders see sitting in government as a means of perpetuating their patronage and ensuring they are not prosecuted for past crimes. </p> <p>There is also wrangling over who will hold the most powerful portfolios. The MDC is anxious to control the ministries that oversee the police and intelligence services, believing that they are the key to ensuring that future elections are free and fair after the two organisations were roped in to the violent and bloody state-orchestrated campaign against opposition supporters. </p> <p>Tsvangirai is less concerned about winning control over the army, which the opposition believes will be loyal to the government of the day.</p> <p>The two parties also disagree over how long the incoming administration will serve. The MDC wants it to sit for about two years, during which a new constitution will be written and elections held. </p> <p>Zanu-PF favours a government serving a full five-year term, in part because if another ballot is held in the near future the party is likely to suffer a devastating defeat, while several years from now Zimbabweans may be less enamoured of the MDC, after they have seen it in power. </p> <p>Tsvangirai holds a number of important cards in the talks. There will be no significant financial aid from the west to stabilise Zimbabwe's economy amid hyperinflation expected to rise to 50,000,000% this month, without a significant shift in power to the MDC leader. Britain, the US and the EU have all said that a \u00a31bn aid package will only be released if Mugabe relinquishes control of the government.</p> <p>It could also be argued that Mbeki needs an agreement as much as Tsvangirai in order to justify his much-criticised Zimbabwe policy and regain some of his rapidly eroding political credibility at home. </p> <p>Some of those who have backed Tsvangirai fear he may be desperate to become prime minister and give too much away. </p> <p>The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions, which Tsvangirai once headed and which gave birth to the MDC, has criticised the fact that negotiations take place behind closed doors with only political parties present. It said the talks should \"reflect the will of the people of Zimbabwe and not self-seeking, power-sharing agendas\".</p> <p>\"Zimbabwe is not made up of supporters of Zanu-PF and MDC alone, but a plethora of groupings which have to be consulted if the process is to gain wider acceptance by the majority,\" it said last month when talks were announced.</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>Zimbabwe's political negotiations come against a background of <strong>rapid economic collapse</strong>, driven by hyper-inflation, which brought large parts of the country to the brink of starvation. The government officially puts <strong>inflation</strong> at 2,200,000% but economists say that it was closer to 10,000,000% last month and they estimate it will rise to about 50,000,000% in August. This month, the central bank removed 10 zeros from the Zimbabwe dollar because rapid <strong>devaluation</strong> had dragged it to Z$1.5tn to the pound. The currency has continued to implode, losing half of its value in a week. The World Food Programme warned that up to 5.1 million Zimbabweans - nearly one third of the population - will need <strong>food aid</strong> this year because the economic crisis and the redistribution of formerly white-owned farms has led to a collapse in crop production.</p>",
  "<p>They fettered his mouth with chains,<br>And tied his hands to the rock of the dead.<br>They said: You're a murderer.<br>They took his food, his clothes and his banners,<br>And threw him into the well of the dead.<br>They said: You're a thief.<br>They threw him out of every port,<br>And took away his young beloved.<br>And then they said: You're a refugee.</p> <p>With poems from the 1960s such as this, Mahmoud Darwish, who has died in a Texas hospital aged 67 of complications following open-heart surgery, did as much as anyone to forge a Palestinian national consciousness, and especially after the six-day war of June 1967. His poems have been taught in schools throughout the Arab world and set to music; some of his lines have become part of the fabric of modern Arabic culture.</p> <p>Darwish was born in the village of Birwa, east of Acre. His parents were from middle-ranking peasant families. Both were preoccupied with work on their land and Mahmoud was effectively brought up by his grandfather. When he was six, Israeli armed forces assaulted the village and Mahmoud fled with his family to Lebanon, living first in Jezzin and then in Damour. </p> <p>When, the following year, the family returned to their occupied homeland, their village had been obliterated: two settlements had been erected on the land, and they settled in Deir al-Asad in Galilee. There were no books in Darwish's own home and his first exposure to poetry was through listening to an itinerant singer on the run from the Israeli army. He was encouraged to write poetry by an elder brother.</p> <p>Israeli Arabs lived under military rule from 1948 to 1986. They were curbed in their movements and in any political activity. As a child, Darwish grew up aware that as far as those in control were concerned he, his family and his fellow Palestinians were second-class citizens. Yet they were still expected to join in Israeli state celebrations. While at school, he wrote a poem for an anniversary of the foundation of the state. The poem was an outcry from an Arab boy to a Jewish boy. \"I don't remember the poem,\" he recalled many years later, \"but I remember the idea of it; you can play in the sun as you please, and have your toys, but I can't. You have a house, and I have none. You have celebrations, but I have none. Why can't we play together?\" He recalls being summoned to see the military governor, who threatened him: \"If you go on writing such poetry, I'll stop your father working in the quarry.\"</p> <p>But relations with individual Jewish Israelis varied. Some he liked, including at least one of his teachers, some he loathed. Relationships with Jewish girls were easier than with girls from the more conservative Arab families.</p> <p>At his school, contemporaries remember him being very good in Hebrew. Israeli Palestinian culture was cut off from mainstream Arab developments. Arab poets who did impress him were the Iraqis Abd al-Wahhab al-Bayati and Badr Shakir al-Sayyab. Exciting innovations such as the Beirut group that clustered round the magazine al-Shi'r and the prosodic and thematic innovations of the Syrian poets Adonis (Ali Ahmad Said Asbar) and Nizar Kabbani did not reach the beleaguered Palestinians directly. Instead, much of Darwish's early reading of the poetry of the world outside Palestine was through the medium of Hebrew. Through Hebrew translations he got to know the work of Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca and Pablo Neruda. He also became influenced by Hebrew literature from the Torah to the modern poet Yehuda Amichai.</p> <p>His first poetry symbolised the Palestinian resistance to Israeli rule. His first volumes, Leaves of the Olive Tree (1964), A Lover from Palestine (1966) and End of the Night (1967), were published in Israel. During this time Darwish was a member of the Israeli Communist party, Rakah, and edited the Arabic edition of the party's newspaper, Al-Ittihad. Israeli Palestinians were restricted in any expression of nationalist feeling. Darwish went to prison several times and was frequently under house arrest.</p> <p>His earliest poetry followed classical forms, but, from the mid-1960s, it became populist and direct. He used imagery that he could relate intimately to Palestinian villagers. He wrote of olive groves and orchards, the rocks and plants, basil and thyme. These early poems have a staccato effect, like verbal hand-grenades. In spite of an apparent simplicity, his short poems have several levels of meaning. There is a sense of anger, outrage and injustice, notably in the celebrated Identity Card, in the voice of an Arab man giving his identity number:</p> <p>Write down at the top of the first page:</p> <p>I do not hate people.<br>I steal from no one.<br>However<br>If I am hungry<br>I will eat the flesh of my usurper.<br>Beware beware of my hunger<br>And of my anger.</p> <p>But his poetry also contained irony and a universal humanity. For Darwish the issue of Palestine became a prism for an internationalist feeling. The land and history of Palestine was a summation of millennia, with influences from Canaanites, Hebrews, Greeks, Romans, Ottoman Turks and British. Throughout all this has survived a core identity of Palestine. He was able to see the Israeli soldier as a victim of circumstances like himself. He expresses the bureaucratic absurdities of an oppressive military occupation.</p> <p>Darwish left Israel in 1971, to the disappointment of many Palestinians, and studied at Moscow University. After a brief period in Cairo he went to Beirut and held a number of jobs with the Palestine Research Centre. He remained in Beirut during the first part of the civil war and left with Yasser Arafat and the PLO in 1982. He moved on to Tunis and Paris, and became editor-in-chief of the influential literary review Al-Karmel. Although he became a member of the PLO executive committee in 1987 and helped to draft the Palestinian Declaration of Statehood, he tried to keep away from factionalism. \"I am a poet with a particular perspective on reality,\" he said.</p> <p>His literary work was changing. He wrote short stories and developed a style of writing poems that was a mixture of observation, humanity and irony. He argued that poetry was easier to write than prose. But the poetry continued inspired by incidents or relationships. There is often an optimism against all the odds in his works of the 1980s:</p> <p>Streets encircle us<br>As we walk among the bombs.<br>Are you used to death?<br>I'm used to life and to endless desire.<br>Do you know the dead?<br>I know the ones in love.</p> <p>During his Paris years Darwish wrote Memory for Forgetfulness, a memoir of Beirut under the saturation Israeli bombing of 1982 which has been translated into English. A poem in prose, it is a medley of wit and rage, with reflections on violence and exile. </p> <p>His later work became more mystical and less particularly concerned with Palestine. Often it was preoccupied with human mortality. He was careless of his own health and suffered heart attacks in 1984 and in early 1998.</p> <p>Darwish resigned from the PLO executive committee over the 1993 Oslo Agreements between Israel and the PLO, which he saw as a \"risky accord\". He was able to return to Israel to see his aged mother in 1995. The Israeli authorities also gave him permission for an unlimited stay in the self-ruling parts of the Palestinian West Bank, and he spent his last years in Ramallah and Amman, the capital of Jordan. </p> <p>In 2000 the Israeli ministry of education proposed to introduce his works into the school curriculum, but met strong opposition from rightwing protesters. The then prime minister, Ehud Barak, said the country was not ready. </p> <p>Darwish's work has been translated into Hebrew and, in July 2007, Darwish returned to Israel on a visit and gave a reading of his poetry to 2,000 people in Haifa. He deplored the Hamas victory in Gaza the previous month. \"We have triumphed,' he observed with grim irony. \"Gaza has won its independence from the West Bank. One people now have two states, two prisons who don't greet each other. We are dressed in executioners' clothes.\"</p> <p>Over the years Darwish received many honours. He was given the Soviet Union's Lotus prize in 1969, and the Lenin peace prize in 1983. He was president of the Union of Palestinian Writers. Married and divorced twice, he had no children; his first wife was the Syrian writer Rana Kabbani, who elegantly translated some of his poetry into English.</p> <p><strong>Margaret Obank writes:</strong> Mahmoud was a completely secular person, rather philosophical, an avid reader, elegant in his dress, and supremely modest in his opinion of himself. He liked to be alone, but would always be ready to speak on the telephone. </p> <p>While I had been reading his poems since the early 1970s, I got to know him through my husband, the Iraqi author Samuel Shimon. Mahmoud supported Banipal, the literary magazine we founded in 1998, and took pride both in issues of the journal and the many dialogues we helpled to promote. </p> <p>It presents work by Arab authors and poets in English for the first time. When we rang Mahmoud three months ago about doing a special issue on him, his reaction was: \"Do you think I deserve that? If you think I do, then I like the idea.\" Now it will be a tribute to him. </p> <p>We were with Mahmoud when he was awarded the Prince Claus Fund of principal prize in Amsterdam in 2004, the theme being asylum and migration. His acceptance speech was both powerful and thoughtful: \"A person can only be born in one place. However, he may die several times elsewhere: in the exiles and prisons, and in a homeland transformed by the occupation and oppression into a nightmare. Poetry is perhaps what teaches us to nurture the charming illusion: how to be reborn out of ourselves over and over again, and use words to construct a better world, a fictitious world that enables us to sign a pact for a permanent and comprehensive peace ... with life.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Mahmoud Darwish, poet, born March 15 1941; died August 9 2008</p>",
  "<p>How much is the west, and specifically the US, to blame for the war between Russian and Georgia?</p> <p>Quite a lot, according to some commentators, who happen to be American. Steve Clemons at Washington Note sees a <a href=\"http://www.thewashingtonnote.com/archives/2008/08/georgiarussia_c/\">\"high quotient of American culpability\"</a>.</p> <p>He argues that when Kosovo declared independence earlier this year, the price of Russian cooperation on other global issues rose considerably and that chances of a clash over Georgia's breakaway border provinces increased dramatically.</p> <blockquote> <p>By pushing Kosovo the way the US did and aggravating nationalist sensitivities, Russia could in reaction be rationally expected to further integrate and cultivate South Ossetia and Abkhazia under de facto Russian control and pull these provinces that border Russia away from the state of Georgia ...</p> <p>At the time, there was word from senior level sources that Russia had asked the US to stretch an independence process for Kosovo over a longer stretch of time - and tie to it some process of independence for the two autonomous Georgia provinces. In exchange, Russia would not veto the creation of a new state of Kosovo at the security council. The US rejected Russia's secret entreaties and instead rushed recognition of Kosovo and said damn the consequences.</p> </blockquote> <p>However, it could be argued that Russia and Georgia were heading for a clash over South Ossetia, with or without Kosovo independence, as the issue has been simmering for years. </p> <p>Vladimir Putin, the Russian president turned prime minister, in his public statements seemed to put more importance on Georgia's ambitions to join Nato. At its summit in Bucharest this year, <a href=\"http://www.nato.int/issues/nato-georgia/index.html\">Nato agreed that Georgia would become a member</a> of the western military alliance, which would not have gone down well with the Kremlin.</p> <p>What is not in dispute is that Georgia's president, Mikheil Saakashvili, overplayed his hand or walked into a Russian trap, but that is almost besides the point. James Sherr, an analyst at the Chatham House thinktank, argues that what the episode shows is Russia's determination to protect its owns interests whatever it takes. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/2531270/Georgia-Russia-demands-to-be-regarded-as-number-one.html\">He writes in the Sunday Telegraph.</a></p> <blockquote> <p>... Russia has (in Putin's words) \"earned a right to be self-interested\" and that in its own \"zone\", it will defend these interests irrespective of what others think about them. For Russia, the broader implications are also becoming straightforward. To its political establishment, to the heads of Gazprom and Rosneft, to its armed forces and security services and to their advisors and \"ideologists\", the key point is that the era of western dominance is over.</p> </blockquote> <p>On Politico, Ben Smith looks at how Barack Obama and John McCain, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0808/12409.html\">the two US presidential hopefuls have reacted to the crisis</a>. He notes that Obama took a very mainstream position, calling for negotiations, but that McCain took a much more confrontational stance towards Russia. Smith concludes that McCain's position \"put him more closely in line with the moral clarity and American exceptionalism projected by President Bush's first term\". Of course now in the last days of his presidency, Bush has become much more pragmatic. The \"axis of evil\" rhetoric has been jettisoned and the US is talking to both North Korea and Iran.</p>",
  "<p>Police investigations, commissions of inquiry examining the errors committed during the Lebanon war of 2006, repugnance at former president <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Katsav\">Moshe Katsav</a>'s alleged sex crimes, and now prime minister Ehud Olmert's announcement that, with charges of corruption swirling about him, he will resign in September: all of this suggests profound wounds in Israel's moral tissue. </p> <p>Old Israelis like myself are stupefied by the scope and scale of today's corruption and the multiplying investigations. Is corruption something that has always existed here but was somehow hidden until now? Are we learning of it because our prosecutor and police are bolder and better equipped nowadays? </p> <p>I do not believe that corruption is coming to light just because law enforcement is somehow better, or because citizens, like the presidential staff who accused President Katsav of sexual crimes and harassment, are more courageous. What is coming to light is a much deeper evil, a loss of values within Israeli society and its government, such as never existed before. </p> <p>This moral deterioration is most prominent in the behaviour of today's accused, who are much more impudent and aggressive than in the past. I remember how in the 1970's, when suspicion of corruption arose with respect to a Labour party minister, the minister took his own life. So did a director of a great bank, a brilliant economist, when he was suspected of financial crimes. </p> <p>When <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinchas_Sapir\">Pinchas Sapir</a>, prime minister Golda Meir's finance minister died, all that he owned was a modest apartment in Tel Aviv and some small savings. David Ben Gurion, Israel's founder and most prominent political personality, spent the last 11 years of his life living in a little wooden house in the desert kibbutz Sde Boker. Today, that house's extreme modesty still surprises visitors.<br> Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin also lived until his death in a simple apartment in Tel Aviv. Not the smallest shadow of the slightest suspicion of corruption ever disturbed his peace. </p> <p>True, corruption has also become more common in other countries in recent years, and many democracies are stained by links between politics and finance. Economic interests are supplanting ideology as the motor of politics, and money serves as the key instrument in elections. But how is it that Israel, which only a few years ago was hardly touched by fraud and corruption, is now swept by them? </p> <p>The recent episodes of corruption, I believe, are rooted in the division, beginning in 1967, of two altogether distinct sets of norms and values. On the one hand, the moral and jurisdictional principles of the democratic state have continued to be applied in Israel in accordance with the tradition of the rule of law. On the other hand, in the Palestinian territories, a new system of values has been progressively established. </p> <p>These two systems operate side by side, but the border that separates them has gradually become more porous, and the open breaches in it have become ever greater. Unlike colonial states, in which colonisers came from distant metropolises (and only in small numbers) the Palestinian territories are just across the border from Israel. </p> <p>In the West Bank the organs of jurisdiction operate in a completely different way. Palestinian lands are illegally confiscated. Jewish settlers act outside the law and commit provocative acts harming Palestinians, rarely incurring any penal sanctions. Injustice and exploitation are an everyday occurrence, justified by references to security or the ideology of Greater Israel. </p> <p>The boundaries between the two types of legalities could not remain impenetrable forever. Little by little, the state of occupation, which should have been temporary, became a stable reality, and the policy of creating Israeli settlements in the heart of the Palestinian population strengthened the connection between Israel and the occupied territories. The norms of a colonial and militarist regime have begun to infiltrate the governing organs of Israel's democracy, perverting their proper activities. Politicians, functionaries, army officials \u2013 usually coming from the right \u2013 introduced into Israeli political life the disgraceful norms in force in the occupied territories. So corruption has grown. </p> <p>Fortunately, Israel's judicial system remains independent and rests on foundations of proven integrity. The presence of many women in the magistrature and the police has also contributed significantly, in my view, to reinforcing the system. But when inadmissible norms become tolerated in silence, even the strongest juridical system becomes destabilised. </p> <p>Nor should we forget that the global economy, with which Israel is deeply integrated, creates infinite and complex opportunities for financial crimes. </p> <p>In these conditions, a strong judicial system and police force do not always suffice to contain corruption. The support of public opinion is also needed. </p> <p>I have the impression that the latest disturbing allegations of corruption among politicians and state functionaries have awakened Israel's citizens from their stupor. They are now demanding that the rule of law and justice return to their central place in public life. Of course, the true test will be whether such demands are reflected in September's parliamentary election. </p> <p><strong>Copyright: <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2008.</strong></p>",
