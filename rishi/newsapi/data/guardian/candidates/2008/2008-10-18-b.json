  "<p>Just occasionally, as gloom flows like molten lava, it's useful to try a touch of history. So what do you do when a prophet you greatly admire - Emily Bell, director of digital content here at the Guardian and Observer - talks about 'systemic collapse, not just cyclical downturn' in a lecture last week? How do you survive Emily's vision of worst-case 'carnage' - five national papers (and much else) dead within a couple of years? You reach for a modern history text of ABC circulation figures and hope to find something better.</p> <p>Five years ago - a historic turning point - the shape of newspaper things to come changed abruptly. The Independent went tabloid and the Times followed; a little later, the Guardian became a Berliner. In the quality market, only the Telegraph stayed stalwartly broadsheet. And now? Take last month's circulation figures and compare them directly with September 2003, the month just before the first tabloid plans were hatched. See how shrinking page sizes worked out. </p> <p>The Indy was selling 218,567 then, 144,050 of them at full cover price (excluding bulk giveaways, overseas copies and cut-price wheezes). Last month it recorded 220,957 on the top line and sold 128,738 at full price, which is 15,312 down. The Times had a total sale of 629,815 in September 2003, of which 455,603 were at full price. Last month, that was 638,003 with 435,771 at full price, a 19,832 drop. The Guardian had 353,464 in overall headline terms, with 330,484 at full price, compared with a 348,878 headline last month and 287,288 at full price; 43,000-plus gone.</p> <p>And the unchanging Telegraph? In headline terms, 934,341 five years ago, with 546,905 at full price: Last month: 851,254 top-line and 379,595 at full price; 167,310 full-price 90ps gone. </p> <p>Now, those are only bare facts, and conclusions come clothed in many shades of interpretation. The fashionable move to copies bought at a lesser price on subscription affects some comparisons, as does the timing of the switch in size. Migration online has a clear impact. There are a host of other variables, too.</p> <p>But can you totally put aside the thought that the one daily that didn't shape down has endured the biggest losses in headline and full-price terms - and that the first two quality tabloids in the ring are both recording higher ABC sales than they were five years ago? </p> <p>Sometimes, amid encircling gloom, it's wise to set benchmarks longer than a week last Friday. Always, there are choices to be made - or not made. And usually (perhaps, maybe) innovation is its own reward. A Times drop of under 20,000 in five years isn't systemic collapse. A Guardian surge online that brings in more than 23 million unique users a month on top of a million-plus print readers isn't carnage. (Neither is an Observer September full-price sale of 381,145 too dusty when you set it against the 398,175 of five years back.) </p> <p>Of course, some drumbeats threaten doom. A People down 13 per cent or a Daily Star Sunday minus 21 per cent in a year aren't exactly long-distance runners. Yet there's the FT - revenues up 11 per cent this year - to throw into the pot. Then there's the pending dip in digital revenues to create new equations. Great papers such as the New York Times are 12 per cent down, and worse. But the NYT has been whacking up the price, cutting back on pagination and cutting off areas of former circulation as too expensive to serve. It's contrived some of its own desuetude. Maybe it ought to try turning tabloid.</p> <h2>BBC 'vision' merely shuffles pieces round the board</h2> <p>If you lived in Manchester when Granada was in its pomp, you knew what benefits flowed: the city was a smarter, sassier, more intelligent place because creative people made it so. Perhaps shifting 1,600 BBC staff up from London to Salford Quays will give the same buzz. Perhaps moving Question Time to Glasgow or Casualty to Cardiff will make all of Britain buzzier still. </p> <p>Yet somehow the new raft of moves announced by Jana Bennett, the modestly named Director of Vision - 6 per cent of network spending in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland up to 12 per cent by 2012 and 17 per cent by 2016 and so forth - don't have that Granada touch of romance: more a feel of keeping politicians and management consultants happy, of sharing out licence-fee budgets like dolly mixtures. Thus Scotland gets The Weakest Link - and presumably thousands of contestants travelling north in a carbon cloud of extra emissions only marginally alleviated by letting Kirsty Wark do Newsnight without leaving Glasgow. </p> <p>But where's the creative juice in merely pushing existing shows round a board? The real vision thing comes from cross-fertilisation, not from (oh regions! oh nations!) shunting coverage of the Chelsea Flower Show off to Birmingham.</p> <h2>It isn't fair. It isn't balanced. Please can we have something like it?</h2> <p>Forget The Wire: the best, most savage and scintillating performance anywhere on TV (and More 4) this autumn, nine years old and going ever stronger, is the Daily Show with Jon Stewart. A comic as one of America's four 'most trusted' news presenters? You bet, as he pulverises Palin, minces McCain and burns Bush. This isn't a Rory Bremner turn, guns prudently balanced. This is a USA where Joe Sixpack drinks Sauvignon Blanc and hockey mums wear Prada.</p> <p>Why can't we have our own, home-grown daily dose? I asked one of the BBC's supreme controllers this the other day. Well, it would have a very small audience, she said. Really? In a world where Private Eye is our top-selling news magazine? And if the Beeb doesn't fancy an eyeful, then what on earth is Four for?</p> <h2>Mandy can lord it over snarling, sneering Mail</h2> <p>It's not often that the Daily Mail slithers down the slope from Rant to Rave to totally Ridiculous: but score one for the new Lord Mandelson of Foy.</p> <p>Quentin Letts was in the gallery for Mandelson's ermine debut, demanding: 'Just how can we see this Cabinet twice-reject, this Brussels blow-in, this greased porker made a lord and not, ourselves, squeal with disgust?' And that was only the headline. You had to read the small print to get the predictable jokes about Fey and bottom-clenching.</p> <p>Enough? By no means. Five pages on - 'The Day the House of Lords died of Shame' - Richard Littlejohn did it again. More noxious clouds of homophobia (involving sausages) and splenetic splutter. 'No sane person would keep [Baron M] as a pet - I'd rather have the neighbourhood nonce round for a Gary Glitter-themed children's birthday party'.</p> <p>Enough? Gosh, 24 hours later came yet another full page, this time with the touch of class and literary allusion Max Hastings provides. So we had Mandelson as Rasputin, 'relegating' the black-bearded monk 'to amateur status'. And the poet Cowper: 'I am the lord of the foul and the brute.' And Wodehouse on 'one of the lowest things to climb out of the slime'. Plus a more general blast about the lust of 'these ghastly old socialists' to 'lord it over us' and take titles from government (unlike Sir Max).</p> <p>Enough, surely? No: try another full page of 'disturbing questions' from David Williams, Chief Reporter, featuring a rich Russian, a yacht, a cocktail party and the clinching words of eternal damnation: 'According to a report in the Evening Standard ... '.</p> <p>And all this, remember, may only be for starters. It's too much already for the redoubtable Alice Miles in the Times: 'Britain was meant to be nicer than this.' But the Mail doesn't do nice. What it does do increasingly, though, is go over the top behind a barrage of sneer, snarl and innuendo, every hired gun blazing. Good stuff? Well, we'll see. But already it's pulled off one fantastic trick: making you feel a little ashamed - and somewhat sorry for his lordship.</p> <h2>Recognition for British business journalists</h2> <p>As the Gawker US website hands out plaudits for valiant performance in 'Panic '08' Britain has something to smile about. Lionel Barber, editor of the FT, is lauded for consistent seriousness, as is his chief business reporter, John Gapper, 'admirably hard on the villains'. Robert Thomson, late of the Times, is praised for a Wall Street Journal redesign 'perfect for big, scary headlines'. UK rules, OK?</p>",
  "<p>Every so often, a famous actor or producer will contact Seymour Hersh, wanting to make a movie about his most famous story: his single-handed uncovering, in 1969, of the My Lai massacre, in which an American platoon stormed a village in South Vietnam and, finding only its elderly, women and children, launched into a frenzy of shooting, stabbing and gang-raping. It won him a Pulitzer prize and hastened the end of the Vietnam war. Mostly, they come to see him in his office in downtown Washington, a two-room suite that he has occupied for the past 17 years. Do they like what they see? You bet they do, even if the movie has yet to be made. 'Brad Pitt loved this place,' says Hersh with a wolfish grin. 'It totally fits the clich\u00e9 of the grungy reporter's den!' When last he renewed the lease, he tells me, he made it a condition of signing that the office would not be redecorated - the idea of moving all his stuff was too much. It's not hard to see why. Slowly, I move my head through 180 degrees, trying not to panic at the sight of so much paper piled so precipitously. Before me are 8,000 legal notepads, or so it seems, each one filled with a Biro Cuneiform of scribbled telephone numbers. By the time I look at Hersh again - the full panorama takes a moment or two - he is silently examining the wall behind his desk, which is grey with grime, and striated as if a billy goat had sharpened its horns on it.</p> <p>And then there is Hersh himself, a splendid sight. After My Lai, he was hired by the New York Times to chase the tail of the Watergate scandal, a story broken by its rival, the Washington Post. In All the President's Men, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein's book about their scoop, they describe him - the competition. He was unlike any reporter they'd ever seen: 'Hersh, horn-rimmed and somewhat pudgy, showed up for dinner in old tennis shoes, a frayed pinstriped shirt that might have been at its best in his college freshman year and rumpled, bleached khakis.' Forty years on, little has changed. Today he is in trainers, chinos and a baggy navy sweatshirt and - thanks to a tennis injury - he is walking like an old guy: chest forward, knees bandy, slight limp in one leg. There is something cherishably chaotic about him. A fuzzy halo of frantic inquiry follows him wherever he goes, like the cloud of dust that hovers above Pig Pen in the Charlie Brown strip. In conversation, away from the restraining hand of his bosses at the New Yorker, the magazine that is now his home, his thoughts pour forth, unmediated and - unless you concentrate very hard - seemingly unconnected. 'Yeah, I shoot my mouth off,' he says, with faux remorse. 'There's a huge difference between writing and thinking.' Not that he has much time for those who put cosy pontification over the graft of reporting: 'I think... My colleagues! I watch 'em on TV, and every sentence begins with the words: \"I think.\" They could write a book called I Think.'</p> <p>But we must backtrack a little. Before the office, there is the breakfast joint. Hersh and I meet at the Tabard Inn, a Washington hangout so gloomily lit I could do with a torch. He has poached eggs and coffee and 'none of that other stuff, thanks'. (I think he means that he doesn't want potatoes with his eggs). Like everyone in America just now, he is on tenterhooks. A Democrat who truly despises the Bush regime, he is reluctant to make predictions about exactly what is going to happen in the forthcoming election on the grounds that he might 'jinx it'. The unknown quantity of voter racism apart, however, he is hopeful that Obama will pull it off, and if he does, for Hersh this will be a starting gun. 'You cannot believe how many people have told me to call them on 20 January [the date of the next president's inauguration],' he says, with relish. '[They say:] \"You wanna know about abuses and violations? Call me then.\" So that is what I'll do, so long as nothing awful happens before the inauguration.' He plans to write a book about the neocons and, though it won't change anything - 'They've got away with it, categorically; anyone who talks about prosecuting Bush and Cheney [for war crimes] is kidding themselves' - it will reveal how the White House 'set out to sabotage the system... It wasn't that they found ways to manipulate Congressional oversight; they had conversations about ending the right of Congress to intervene.'</p> <p>In one way, it's amazing Hersh has anything left to say about Bush, Cheney and their antics. Then again, with him, this pushing of a story on and on is standard practice. Though it was Woodward and Bernstein who uncovered the significance of the burglary at the Watergate building, Hersh followed up their scoop by becoming one of Nixon's harshest critics and by breaking stories about how the government had supported Pinochet's 1973 coup in Chile, secretly bombed Cambodia and used the CIA to spy on its domestic enemies. His 1983 book about Nixon, The Price of Power, is definitive. So far as the War on Terror goes, Hersh has already delivered his alternative history - Chain of Command, a book based on the series of stories he wrote for the New Yorker in the aftermath of 9/11 and following Bush's invasion of Iraq. Among other things, Hersh told us of the bungled efforts to catch Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan; of the dubious business dealings of the superhawk Richard Perle - a report that led to Perle's resignation as chairman of the Pentagon's Defense Policy Board (Hersh alleged that Perle improperly mixed his business affairs with his influence over US foreign policy when he met the Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi in 2003. Perle described Hersh as 'the closest thing American journalism has to a terrorist' and threatened to sue before falling oddly silent); and of how Saddam's famous efforts to buy uranium in Africa, as quoted by President Bush in his 2003 State of the Union speech, were a fiction. Most electrifying of all, however, was his triple salvo on the abuse of Iraqi prisoners in Abu Ghraib. It was Hersh who first revealed the full extent of this torture, for which he traced the ultimate responsibility carefully back to the upper reaches of the administration. 'In each successive report,' writes David Remnick, the editor of the New Yorker, in his introduction to Chain of Command, 'it became clear that Abu Ghraib was not an \"isolated incident\" but, rather, a concerted attempt by the government and the military leadership to circumvent the Geneva Conventions in order to extract intelligence and quell the Iraqi insurgency.' As Remnick points out, this reporting has 'stood up over time and in the face of a president whose calumny has turned out to be a kind of endorsement'. Bush reportedly told Pakistan's president, Pervez Musharraf, that Hersh was 'a liar'; after the third of his reports on Abu Ghraib, a Pentagon spokesman announced that Hersh merely 'threw a lot of crap against the wall and he expects someone to peel off what's real. It's a tapestry of nonsense.'</p> <p>Earlier this year, Hersh turned his attention to Iran: to Bush's desire to bomb it and to America's covert operations there. But while Hersh believes the President would still dearly love to go after Iran, the danger of that actually happening has now passed. Events, not least the sinking of the global economy, have moved on. So he is shortly to write about Syria instead, which he has recently visited. In the dying days of the Bush administration, he says, it is noticeably easier to meet contacts - Cheney, the enforcer, is a lot less powerful - and the information he is getting is good. By coincidence, it was in Syria that he first heard about what was going on inside Abu Ghraib, long before he saw documentary evidence of it. 'I got in touch with a guy inside Iraq during the Prague Spring after the fall of Baghdad, a two-star guy from the old regime. He came up to Damascus by cab. We talked for four days, and one of the things we talked about was prisons. He told me that some of the women inside had been sending messages to their fathers and brothers asking them to come and kill them because they'd been molested. I didn't know whether it was GIs playing grab ass or what, but it was clear that the women had been shamed. So when I first heard about the photographs, I knew they were real. Did I think the story would be as big as it was? Yeah. But was it as big as My Lai? No.' Only a handful of relatively lowly military personnel have so far been punished for their part in the abuse, and Colonel Janis Karpinski, the commander of the Iraqi prisons, was merely demoted (from Brigadier General), in spite of the fact that the Taguba Report, the internal US army report on detainee abuse that was leaked to Hersh, singled her out for blame. 'And John Kerry wouldn't even use it [Abu Ghraib] in his campaign. He didn't want to offend the military, I assume.'</p> <p>Four decades separate My Lai and Abu Ghraib. You have to ask: wasn't it appalling for him to be investigating US army abuses of civilians all over again? Didn't he think that lessons might have been learnt? Yes, and no. It made him feel 'hopeless', but on the other hand, war is always horrible. In 1970, after his My Lai story, he addressed an anti-war rally and, on the spur of the moment, asked a veteran to come up and tell the crowd what some soldiers would do on their way home after a day spent moving their wounded boys. With little prompting, the traumatised vet described how they would buzz farmers with their helicopter blades, sometimes decapitating them; they would then clean up the helicopter before they landed back at base. 'That's what war is like,' he says. 'But how do you write about that? How do you tell the American people that?' Still, better to attempt to tell people than to stay feebly silent. What really gets Hersh going - he seems genuinely bewildered by it - is the complicit meekness, the virtual collapse, in fact, of the American press since 9/11. In particular, he disdains its failure to question the 'evidence' surrounding Saddam's so-called weapons of mass destruction. 'When I see the New York Times now, it's so shocking to me. I joined the Times in 1972, and I came with the mark of Cain on me because I was clearly against the war. But my editor, Abe Rosenthal, he hired me because he liked stories. He used to come to the Washington bureau and almost literally pat me on the head and say: \"How is my little Commie today? What do you have for me?\" Somehow, now, reporters aren't able to get stories in. It was stunning to me how many good, rational people - people I respect - supported going into war in Iraq. And it was stunning to me how many people thought you could go to war against an idea.'</p> <p>As for the troop 'surge' and its putative success, he more or less rolls his eyes when I bring this up. 'People are saying quietly that they are worried about Iraq. This is nothing profound, but by the time the surge got going, ethnic cleansing had already happened in a lot of places. There was a natural lull in the violence. The moment we start withdrawing, and relying on the Shia to start paying members of the Awakening [the alliance of Sunni insurgents whose salaries were initially paid by the US military, and who have helped to reduce violence in some provinces]...' His voice trails off. 'And the big bad bogeyman is Saudi Arabia. There's an awful lot of money going to Salafist and Wahabist charities, and there's no question they'll pour money into the Awakening, and they're so hostile to Shi'ism and to Iran that how can you possibly predict anything other than violence? How do we get out of this? There is no way out. We have a moral obligation to the people of Iraq that goes beyond anything that anyone's talking about. The notion that it's their problem, that we should just leave... I mean, can you believe what we've done to their society? Imagine the psychosis, the insanity, that we've induced.' He stabs the yolk of one of his poached eggs, and sets about his toast like he hasn't eaten in days.</p> <p>Seymour M Hersh (the M is for Myron) was born in Chicago, the son of Yiddish-speaking immigrants from Lithuania and Poland (he has a twin brother, a physicist, and two sisters, also twins). The family was not rich; his father, who died when Seymour was 17, ran a dry-cleaning business. After school he attended a local junior college until a professor took him aside, asked him what he was doing there and walked him up to the University of Chicago. 'Chicago was this great egghead place,' Hersh says. 'But I knew nothing. I came out of a lower-middle-class background. At that time, everyone used to define themselves: Stalinist, Maoist, whatever. I thought they meant \"miaowist\". Seriously! Something to do with cats. Among my peers, they all thought I would write the great novel, because I was very quick and cutting. I've just read Philip Roth's new novel [Indignation], and the arrogance of his character reminded me of that certitude. I was always pointing out other people's flaws.' He went to law school but hated it, dropped out and wound up as a copy boy, then a reporter for the local City News Bureau. Later he joined Associated Press in Washington and rose through its ranks until he quit for a stint working for the Democrat senator Eugene McCarthy. Pretty soon, though, he was back in journalism. 'Using words to make other people less big made me feel bigger, though the psychological dimension to that... well, I don't want to explore it.' His wife of 40 years, Elizabeth, whom he describes as 'the love of my life' in the acknowledgements of Chain of Command (they have three grown-up children), is a psychoanalyst. Doesn't she ever tell him about his ego and his id? He looks embarrassed. 'No, no... marriage is... different. When you live with someone you don't... The hardest part for her is when she tells me to take out the garbage and I say: \"Excuse me? I don't have time. I'm saving the world.\"' Later, however, he tells me that journalism, like psychoanalysis, is about 'bringing things into focus'. </p> <p>He was a broke freelance working for a new syndication agency when he got wind of My Lai. A military lawyer told him that a soldier at Fort Benning, a Georgia army base, was facing a court martial for murdering at least 109 Vietnamese civilians. Hersh rocked up in Benning and went on a door-to-door search, somehow avoiding the officers on base, until he found Lieutenant William L Calley Jr, a boyish 26-year-old otherwise known as Rusty. He asked the former railway pointsman if they could talk, which they did, for three hours. They then went to the grocery store, got steaks, bourbon and wine, and talked some more at the apartment of Calley's girlfriend. Calley told Hersh that he had only been following orders, but nevertheless he described what had happened (it later turned out that soldiers of the 11th Brigade killed 500 or more civilians that morning). Soon after, 36 newspapers ran the story under Hersh's byline. Some, however, did not carry it, in spite of the fact that Calley's own lawyer had confirmed it, among them the New York Times. The scoop caused not only horror but disbelief. Hersh, though, was not to be put off. 'By the third story, I found this amazing fellow, Paul Meadlo, from a small town in Indiana, a farm kid, who had actually shot many of the Vietnamese kids - he'd shot maybe 100 people. He just kept on shooting and shooting, and then the next day he had his leg blown off, and he told Calley, as they medevac-ed him: \"God has punished me and now he will punish you.\"' Hersh wrote this up, CBS put Meadlo on the TV news, and finally the story could no longer be ignored. The next year, 1970, he was awarded the Pulitzer prize. </p> <p>How does Hersh operate? The same way as he's always done: it's all down to contacts. Unlike Bob Woodward, however, whose recent books about Iraq have involved long and somewhat pally chats with the President, Hersh gets his stuff from lower down the food chain. Woodward was one of those who was convinced that WMD would be found in Iraq. 'He does report top dollar,' says Hersh. 'I don't go to the top because I think it's sorta useless. I see people at six o'clock in the morning somewhere, unofficially.' Are they mostly people he has known for a long time? 'No, I do pick up new people.' But with new contacts he must be wary; there is always the danger of a plant. His critics point to what they regard as his excessive use of unnamed sources. Others accuse him of getting things wrong and of being gullible. A low point came in the Nineties, when he embarked on a book about Kennedy, The Dark Side of Camelot. Hersh was shown documents that alleged the President was being blackmailed by Marilyn Monroe, and though he discovered that they were fake in time to remove all mention of them from his book, the damage to his reputation had already been done - and the critics let rip anyway, for his excitable portrayal of JFK as a sex addict and bigamist. There was also the time, in 1974, when he accused the US ambassador to Chile, Edward Korry, of being in on a CIA plot to overthrow President Allende. Some years later, Hersh had to write a long correction; it ran on page one of the New York Times. As a Jew, his mailbag since 9/11 has also included letters from readers who denounce him as a self-hater (later, at this office, he shows me one of these: its author, an MD with a Florida postcode, accuses him of being a 'kapo' - the kapo were concentration camp prisoners who worked for the Nazis in exchange for meagre privileges). </p> <p>His supporters, though, believe that his mistakes - and even the wilder allegations he sometimes makes in speeches - should always be put in the context of his hit rate. A former Washington Post reporter, Scott Armstrong, once put it this way. Say he writes a story about how an elephant knocked someone down in a dark room. 'If it was a camel, or three cows, what difference does it make? It was dark, and it wasn't supposed to be there.' Hersh himself points out that, since 1993, he has been up against the stringent standards of the New Yorker and its legendary team of fact checkers. 'By the way, all my inside sources have to deal with the fact checkers, and they do. People find it hard to believe that, I don't know why.' And then there is his editor, David Remnick. 'I never love editors,' he says. 'But David is smart and he has great judgement.' How often does he check in with Remnick? 'I'm sure he would tell you less often than I should. He gets pretty angry with me. Sometimes we have these rows where I won't take his calls. He says no to a lot of stuff - stuff I think the editor would die for! Admittedly, it is not the Seymour Hersh weekly. But sometimes he'll say: \"We are not going to publish this kind of stuff 'cos it's frigging crazy.\"' It was Tina Brown, formerly of Tatler and Vanity Fair, who brought him to the New Yorker. 'What's-her-name... yeah, Tina. She gave me a lot of money, and she said: \"Just go do it!\" But she used to worry. She'd call me up and say, \"I sat next to Colin Powell at dinner last night and he was railing about how awful you are.\" So I would say, \"Well, that's good.\" And she'd say, \"Is it?\" And I'd tell her, \"Yes, it is.\"'</p> <p>Does it worry him that he is sometimes described as the 'last American reporter'? Who is coming up behind him? 'A friend of mine wants to put $5m into a chair for investigative journalism for me, but why would I want to do that? Look, the cost of running my kind of work is very high, and a lot of stories don't even work out. I know a wonderful journalist who works on the internet. I called friends of mine at the Times and the Post. But he hasn't been hired because he would cost a lot of money.' But Hersh is in his seventies (he is a year younger than John McCain, though you'd never know), he can't keep going forever. Or can he? Most reporters start out hungry but somewhere along the way are sated. Not Hersh. 'I have information; I have people who trust me. What else am I going to do? I love golf and tennis and if I was good enough, I'd be professional. Since I'm not, what am I gonna do? Why shouldn't I be energetic? Our whole country is at stake. We have never had a situation like this. These men have completely ruined America. It's so depressing, my business!' Yet he seems chipper. 'No, I'm not chipper. I don't know how to put where I am... I don't take it that seriously. I've been there: up, down, back up. I do a lotta speeches, I make a lotta money, I proselytise.' Does he like making money? 'Are you kidding? I do!'</p> <p>After we finish breakfast, he takes me to the office. He is eager to put off the moment when he must get on with his Syria piece. The more time he wastes with me... well, the morning will soon be over. Inside he points out a few choice interior-design details - the Pulitzer (it nestles among dozens of other awards), the framed memo from Lawrence Eagleburger and Robert McCloskey to Henry Kissinger, their boss at the State Department, which is dated 24 September 1974, and reads: 'We believe Seymour Hersh intends to publish further allegations on the CIA in Chile. He will not put an end to this campaign. You are his ultimate target.' Then he roots around in a cairn of paper for a while - quite a long while - eventually producing a proof of one of his articles with Remnick's editing marks on it. I've never seen anything so harsh in my life. Practically every other sentence has been ruthlessly disembowelled. 'Yeah, pretty tough, huh?' He also shows me one of his own memos to a contact. It makes reference to the current administration. 'These guys are hard-wired and drinking the Kool-Aid,' it says, deadpan. He laughs. He's getting cheerier by the minute. Soon it will be time for lunch! Now he puts his feet on the desk, removes one training shoe and jauntily waves the sweaty sole of a white sock at me. A couple of calls come in. He is concise bordering on cryptic. Finally an old Times colleague arrives. 'I knew this guy when he had hair!' Hersh shouts as this fellow and I pass in a small area of floorspace not yet covered by books or papers. I'm leaving, but Hersh doesn't get up and he doesn't say goodbye. A breezy salute - and then his eyes fall ravenously on his pal.</p>",
  "<p>Poised, smart and ready to serve, Carly Fiorina - at one time the most powerful female executive on the planet - scents power.</p> <p>There's still a chance that the most intense, volatile and bitter presidential election campaign in living memory could spring a stunning final twist, delivering the Republicans to victory.</p> <p>If John McCain triumphs, Fiorina will follow in his slipstream. As a close friend and economic adviser to the Republican candidate, it is a sure bet that the first and only woman to run a Fortune top 20 company will be catapulted into office.</p> <p>'We'll see,' the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard said last Friday at her Washington home. 'We never expect anything.'</p> <p>With Fiorina, though, expectations are generally pretty high. The daughter of a law school professor from Austin, Texas, she is a fiercely ambitious corporate ball breaker. Starting as a secretary, the 54-year-old penetrated the male dominated preserve of technology companies by drinking beer mugs of vodka and attending meetings held in strip clubs to shatter the glass ceiling as no other woman had ever done in America.</p> <p>It is an achievement that still stands even if it ended in humiliation. Fiorina was forced unceremoniously to bid farewell to her $3m salary and the corporate jets after a merger she had bulldozed through caused Hewlett-Packard to lose an estimated $14bn in value. </p> <p>Still, Fiorina has since dusted herself down. A long standing friendship with McCain has led her to reinvent herself as 'Carly the politician', giving much needed ballast to his economic team - an area in which McCain himself confessed he was no expert. </p> <p>The talk was that Fiorina was being lined up to become Treasury Secretary. And then, last month, disaster. On a radio interview, Fiorina was asked whether she thought Sarah Palin had the experience to run a large US corporation as she had done. 'No I don't,' Fiorina replied. 'That's not what she is running for.' Later, on television, she was asked to clarify those remarks and she compounded the error by saying: 'Well, I don't think John McCain could run a major corporation.'</p> <p>The comments could not have come at a worse time. Even as the markets were collapsing and voters were losing their jobs, savings and homes, a key figure in McCain's team was questioning the candidate's experience. Since 17 September McCain's lead has disappeared. Obama has not looked back. </p> <p>A well-placed Republican insider said: 'This is the most intense campaign and you have to surround yourself with experienced people. She does not qualify in that department. She's not a political person. </p> <p>'For McCain it has to be a seriously calculated, strategic team. She's very bright and a good executive, but politics is not as easy as people think. It's a lot tougher even if you are a smart woman.'</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, Fiorina is furious about the incident. 'Do you know what I said?' she asks. 'The Obama campaign literally cut and pasted those remarks to say what they wanted. They pushed it on the radar. I was given a silly question. I gave a hypothetical answer.' </p> <p>But McCain has another big problem with Fiorina, and it dates back to her sudden departure from Hewlett-Packard after winning a bitter merger battle with rival computer giant Compaq.</p> <p>The saga ended in Fiorina being summarily dismissed as she was preparing to fly to the Swiss Alpine resort of Davos for the meeting of world leaders and the business elite. But she received an estimated $24m severance package.</p> <p>To many, this is an example of rewarding failure. Not to Fiorina, though, whose self-belief remains intact. After all, the subsequent performance of HP, she says, more than vindicates her merger strategy. And it is true that analysts recommend HP shares as a defensive bulwark in plunging markets. But her huge payout has drawn comparisons to the rewards Wall Street bankers have scooped as markets collapse. </p> <p>'My pay package, which Obama has falsely stated, was voted on by shareholders. It's a matter of public record. The way it was handled is the way McCain believes it should be handled.' </p> <p>But isn't the financial crisis caused in part by the style of buccaneering capitalism you epitomised? 'I completely reject that,' she says. 'The current financial crisis has been caused by people lacking in common sense and judgment, greed, unethical behaviour and a fixation with short-term stock prices by everybody from analysts and investors. We had people betting the farm that real estate would rise forever.'</p> <p>It is the kind of homespun talk that could win over voters, but they don't appear to be listening to her or McCain. Voters see the dotcom collapse, the failure of Enron and the present crisis as three financial disasters under a Republican administration. 'Greed is a bipartisan affliction. It's not about political parties. When business people lose common sense, that's a problem,' she says.</p> <p>According to Fiorina, 'the great problem is markets not having confidence with decisions they made'. Is this a criticism of George Bush and his Treasury Secretary, Hank Paulson? 'I think right now, people are doing their best whether it's Gordon Brown or Hank Paulson. There's plenty of blame to go around.'</p> <p>As the US and Europe sink under a wave of debt, there is an increasing sense that American global dominance is disintegrating. So much for the neo-conservative vision of a 21st century ruled by the United States.</p> <p>'Asia without question is emerging as a financial powerhouse. This certainly is different to the 20th century. But American leadership is going to depend on the same things it always has. Innovation and entrepreneurial spirit,' says Fiorina. 'Political power is based on economic power. As long as the US is innovative our growth will be assured.'</p> <p>But will it be a US with McCain as its leader? He's 72. He must be pretty tired. 'They're all getting pretty tired. They have been doing this for two years. But John McCain is a great fighter. He is a man of extraordinary strength and vigour. He described this process as a privilege. He will fight to the last day.'</p> <p>Republican insiders now believe that even if McCain does pull off a victory, Fiorina is no longer in line for the Treasury Secretary's job she covets but a position as an ambassador or some other junior role.</p> <p>That would be a disappointment to the woman who accepts that she 'had to do crazy things to function in a man's world'. When she attended that meeting in a strip club she said her male colleague attempted to intimidate her. But she 'focused on the job' because 'every day you have to earn your stripes'.</p> <p>Twice married, she seems to live by buzzwords and motivational phrases. 'Tough choices, inspired commitment, real results,' her website proclaims. In two weeks, the eyes of the world will be focusing on just one result. But will Fiorina's role in the race to the White House have helped or hindered her man?</p> <h2>The CV</h2> <p><strong>Name</strong> Cara Carleton Sneed Fiorina, known as Carly Fiorina</p> <p><strong>Born</strong> 1954 in Austin, Texas</p> <p><strong>Education</strong>: BA in philosophy and medieval history from Stanford University; MBA in marketing from the University of Maryland; MSc in management from the MIT Sloan School of Management </p> <p><strong>Career</strong> Joined AT&amp;T in 1980 as a management trainee and rose to become a senior vice-president. 1995-99: Lucent Technologies. 1999-2005: Hewlett-Packard chief executive </p> <p><strong>Family</strong> Married to Frank Fiorina for 23 years</p> <p>\u2022 Carly Fiorina will be speaking at the International Leadership Summit in London on 3 and 4 December.

  "<p>Sarah Jessica Parker, Gerry Adams, and all those ordinary Brits and other foreigners who sought their Celtic idyll are going to have pay more for their rural Irish hideaway.</p> <p>The star of Sex and the City and the Sinn Fein president share a passion for Donegal, Ireland's second largest county and home to some of the most stunning scenery on the island. But along with thousands of others, both Irish and foreigners alike, they are now going to be taxed annually for owning holiday homes in Ireland.</p> <p>As part of one of the most brutal budgets in more than two decades, the Irish government announced last week it was slapping a tax on second homes. It will apply to anyone owning a holiday home, whether their first home is in the Republic of Ireland or abroad. Environmentalists and politicians who have been long campaigning for a holiday home tax have welcomed the move.</p> <p>Ireland's version of the UK's National Trust, An Taisce, said this weekend it hopes the tax will, along with the property crash in the Republic, put a halt to over-development in rural parts of the country. An Taisce's Ian Lumley also pointed out that the tax will give the Irish government the first idea since local rates were abolished in 1977 exactly how many holiday homes have actually been built. Fianna Fail won its last overall majority in a general election 31 years ago in part due to its promise to abolish all local government rates.</p> <p>'There has been an explosion of holiday homes in Ireland, the number of which we don't have a clue about. A lot of these developments have been an environmental disaster for parts of rural Ireland. Hopefully the tax will help put a check on the crash development of holiday homes,' Lumley said.</p> <p>He said it was ironic that it was harder for Northern Ireland citizens to build or buy holiday homes on scenic areas like the north Antrim coast than it was across the border in Donegal. Lumley warned, however, that the costs of collection must not exceed the revenue earned from the holiday tax itself.</p> <p>Sarah Jessica Parker and her husband, actor Matthew Broderick, own a white-washed traditional holiday cottage seven miles outside the Donegal port of Killybegs, not far from Muckross Head. North of the Hollywood couple's home in Ardara is the house belonging to retired school teacher Michelle Markham. Based in Belfast, Markham raised the question of whether cottages or houses owned by people from outside the Republic were in fact second homes. 'You could argue that, if you don't live in the Republic, then how does a house here constitute a second home,' she said. 'I'm sure there could be an interesting court case law study about this.'</p> <p>Markham insisted, however, that she was personally happy to pay the tax, which Ireland's Department of Finance is likely to set at around \u20ac200 per annum. 'When I come to Donegal from Belfast I always make it my business to buy in the local shops, to contribute to the local economy, to hire local labour in the county. I'm not one of these people who stock up in supermarkets in Northern Ireland before heading across the border to Donegal. The tax is fair enough, because if you use local services such as water then you should be prepared to pay for them.'</p> <p>Further north Gerry Adams owns a holiday home in Gortahurk, which in recent years has become a popular haunt of fellow Belfast and Derry republicans seeking their Gaelic Arcadia, including the late IRA strategist and one-time bomber Brian Keenan - an influx that has prompted some locals to label it the 'Costa del Provo'.</p> <p>Joe McHugh, the Fine Gael deputy who represents this same part of Donegal in the Dail, gave a belated welcome to the holiday home tax, which he claimed his party had first pioneered.</p> <p>'The tax is fair because a Donegal man or woman who owns a holiday home on, say, the Wexford coast over in the east will also have to pay it.' In McHugh's county alone there are an estimated 8,000 holiday homes, although the Fine Gael deputy said he believed the figure is higher. 'In the good times the Celtic Tiger only came to Donegal at the weekend and now that we are living in lean times it's only right that those who can afford second homes pay for the services they use,' he added.</p>",
  "<h2>Bill Kristol<br>Conservative columnist</h2> <p>What McCain needs to do is junk the whole thing and start over. Shut down the rapid responses, stop putting up new TV and internet ads every minute. In fact, pull all the ads - they're doing no good. Use that money for televised town halls and half-hour addresses in prime time. And let McCain go back to what he's been good at in the past - running as a cheerful, open and accessible candidate. Sarah Palin should follow suit. They're happy warriors and good campaigners. Set them free.</p> <h2>William Murchison<br>Conservative columnist</h2> <p>He might still win. And then again, he might not. What matters is that Captain John McCain has chosen not to strike his colours. There is enormous potential significance in McCain's attempt to rise from the inanity and waste of the weeks since the Republican convention. How do we know he is making the attempt? We can't know anything in this crazy year. He knows he's about to get plow-cleaned the way things are going. It's his last hope, to be seen leading at a time of stress.</p> <h2>Karl Rove<br>Former White House aide</h2> <p>McCain is shaping a storyline that draws on well-founded concerns about Obama's lack of experience. He is also bowing to reality and devoting most of his time to the economy. He's the conservative reformer who'll lead and work hard to get things done, while Obama is the tax-and-spend liberal who's unprepared to lead and unwilling to act. He's criticising Obama for lingering on the sidelines while he dove in to help pass a rescue plan that was necessary, no matter how distasteful.</p> <h2>Gary Bauer<br>Neoconservative leader</h2> <p>The left claims racism as the only possible source of opposition to Obama because it refuses to admit that Obama's extreme liberalism would put off voters. Accordingly, it portrays any criticism of his determination to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory in Iraq, or of his vacuous celebrity persona, as somehow racist. The McCain camp doesn't want to make the election about race, ethnicity or religion. Rather, it wants to make it about experience, principles and issues.</p> <h2>Tucker Carlson<br>Conservative TV pundit</h2> <p>The obvious question is: why not Jeremiah Wright? Wright indisputably was one of Obama's closest friends. Nobody in America needs to be reminded of who Wright is. As long as you've decided to go after Obama's character and associations, Wright seems like the obvious place to start. The 30-second attack ad essentially writes itself.</p> <p>\u2022 Sources: Wall Street Journal, New York Times, <a href=\"http://www.humanevents.com\">humanevents.com</a>, Washington Times, the Daily Beast</p>",

  "<p>Downtown Charlotte looks like the ultimate modern American city. Towering, glass-clad skyscrapers shoot into the blue North Carolina sky and it is hard to find a building that looks more than a few decades old. Sipping a Starbucks coffee in a city park is Tim Cable, 41, who worked as a consultant with the financial firms that have made this the biggest banking centre in America outside New York. It is a very different scene from the stereotypical southern image of rednecks, pick-up trucks and dusty towns. But then again, so are Cable's politics.</p> <p>'I am voting for [Barack] Obama,' he says. 'I decided that more than a year ago.' More surprisingly, Cable thinks the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/democrats\">Democratic candidate</a> could win North Carolina in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselections2008\">November election</a>. That would turn this red state blue, and perhaps herald a huge change in American politics. 'Places like Charlotte are changing the face of the South,' Cable said.</p> <p>It is no pipe dream. In a potentially momentous shift, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Obama's campaign</a> to become America's first black President has made remarkable strides in the South. He has built up a firm lead in Virginia, which has not voted for a Democrat for President since 1964. He has opened up a narrow gap in North Carolina and is ahead in Florida. Across Dixieland, from Texas to Kentucky to the Carolina coast, Republican stalwarts are running up against a surging tide of Democratic party support. </p> <p>Obama's campaign has opened scores of offices across the South, often outnumbering the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/republicans\">Republicans</a> on their own turf. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a> and his running mate, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a>, have been forced to campaign here, diverting them from the battleground of Ohio and Pennsylvania.</p> <p>Obama's performance in the South could mark a new phase in American politics. The South has been the modern Republican party's spiritual home. The social conservative revolution was born here. It is the land of the Bible Belt and social values. Yet the Republican party is facing a serious challenge here for the first time since Bill Clinton.</p> <p>And Obama is no southern white conservative governor like Clinton. He is a liberal black senator from Chicago. If he wins even three of the traditionally Republican southern states, it might be heralded as the start of something almost revolutionary. 'The symbolic importance of electing an African-American is going to be immense,' said Professor Shawn Bowler, a political scientist at the University of California at Riverside.</p> <p>Nowhere is that more true than in the North Carolina town of Greensboro. On Elm Street, the city's main drag, stands a building gradually being renovated as a museum. The red and gold lettering on its front spells out the name Woolworths. It was here in 1960, at the store's diner, that four black students sat down at the whites-only lunch counter and refused to leave until they were served. They went hungry.</p> <p>The next day there were 28 protesters. The day after 300. Within two months the sit-in movement had spread to 15 cities in nine states and the civil rights struggle was ignited. That simple action in Greensboro heralded the long knell of racial segregation in America.</p> <p>Eliza Newson, 85, was born here at a time when her fellow blacks could be lynched for stepping out of line, were segregated from whites and risked their lives if they tried to do something as brazen as voting. Now Newson is going to vote for Obama. 'You know who I am voting for!', she said with a grin when asked her political opinions on the street outside the Woolworths building.</p> <p>Newson remembers the old days in Greensboro vividly. 'It used to be terrible. The white people didn't like the black people. The black people could not do this or could not do that,' she said. Eventually she left for New Jersey, only returning last year to help care for a granddaughter. She has found a Greensboro almost unrecognisable from the city she remembered as a young woman. 'It's changed. It's really changed,' she said.</p> <p>The South has been changing for a long time, but that pace has accelerated in recent decades. Many large cities across the region have successfully attracted modern businesses. That is how Charlotte has become a latter-day North Carolina boom town.</p> <p>The huge Wachovia bank, with 20,000 staff in Charlotte, making it the city's biggest employer, sits at one end of Tyron Street. At the other end stands the corporate headquarters of the even larger Bank of America. For almost three decades the two have engaged in a sort of civic rivalry, building competing skyscrapers and sponsoring rival arts projects as their thousands of employees patronised the swanky restaurants that sprang up on the street linking them.</p> <p>This 'new South' is found everywhere in the region. It has brought in hundreds of thousands of newcomers, often highly educated professionals who have little knowledge of or sympathy with the area's complicated political history. That is especially true in a place like northern Virginia. The area lies close to Washington and is now a booming suburb of the nation's capital. Its population has exploded and it leans heavily Democratic, dragging the rest of Virginia steadily away from the Republican party. Obama has a staggering 8 per cent lead in the state, which was once seen as solid John McCain territory. </p> <p>But that lead has not happened by a simple accident of demography. The Obama campaign has focused hard on winning its gains. Flush with huge amounts of cash, it has poured money and resources into southern states, opening branch offices in places usually ignored by a Democratic presidential campaign. It has 44 of them in Virginia alone. Obama has outspent McCain by a factor of eight to one in North Carolina and by three to one in Florida and Virginia. The Obama 'ground game' is large, highly motivated and very effective. 'The organisation that has been built up is very impressive,' said Professor Jeri Cabot, a political scientist at the College of Charleston in South Carolina. Obama has in the end benefited hugely from his long primary fight with Hillary Clinton. The cross-country battle meant that he built a high profile and organisation in every state in the country. 'Obama owes the Clintons dinner and a bottle of wine. They really helped him,' said Bowler.</p> <p>A key element in Obama's success in the South has been the huge voter drive among college students and black people that began in the primaries and has continued in the presidential run-up. This is aimed at driving up the turnout in groups that have traditionally had a poor record of turning up on election day. That is especially true of the South's black population, which is an almost monolithic Democratic voting bloc in a region that seemed equally monolithically Republican in presidential elections. Now blacks are expected to turn out in record numbers for Obama. In Georgia, they made up almost 40 per cent of the 369,000 early voters in the state, despite representing only 29 per cent of the electorate. McCain's double-digit lead in the state is now down to just 7 per cent. </p> <p>There seems little doubt that the strong enthusiasm black southerners are showing in early balloting is going to be duplicated even more so on election day itself, especially in those states where Obama has a viable chance of winning. Brandon Jackson, a young black writer in Charlotte, is typical. Wearing a T-shirt that features portraits of Obama, Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, he said he was deeply proud to have a chance to vote for a black candidate. </p> <p>'In the younger generation it really means something. It will be an amazing role model,' he said. He, too, thought Obama could win in the South. 'Yeah. There's going to be a huge turnout. He's got black and white people backing him here now.'</p> <p>There are signs that is true. White professional newcomers to the South are as open to Obama as they are elsewhere in the country. But the economic crisis gripping America has also profoundly shocked many working-class whites who might traditionally have shied away from voting for Obama.</p> <p>Take Judie Almond, 68, from the small rural town of Wadesboro, an hour's drive from Charlotte. She is a true social conservative. Resolutely anti-abortion, she fears that the country is on such a slide that homosexual marriage will not only soon be lawful but might become mandatory. 'We can't become a homosexual nation,' she said with passion.</p> <p>But Almond's most colourful biblical language and ire is now aimed firmly at Wall Street, not gays. The credit crisis has trumped all else in her world-view and she blames McCain's party. 'The Republicans have made such a mess. And the salaries these Wall Street people were getting? It's an abomination. It is sinful,' she said. She is almost certain to vote for Obama.</p> <p>Indeed, on the streets of Wadesboro - a hardscrabble little town that once had a textiles industry but now faces tough times - it is difficult to find people with many kind words to say about the Republicans. They blame them for the economy and the increasingly unpopular war in Iraq. The legacy of the past eight years has fallen firmly on McCain's shoulders and his attempts to shrug it off have not succeeded. Even the relentless negative campaigning by the McCain camp seems to have had little impact, and indeed might have backfired.</p> <p>'They should just have let John be John. This campaign is not his style. I don't like the constant attacks,' said James, an elderly man who said he was voting for McCain but declined to give his last name. That attitude is not uncommon. Indeed many whites in the South might end up sitting out this election. Pheobe Medlin certainly will. 'I would have voted for Clinton,' she said as she took a break on a street corner outside Wadesboro's library. 'But now I don't like either one of them.'</p> <p>It is often hard to say exactly how much race plays a role in such white attitudes. After all, in policy terms both Obama and Clinton are worlds away from McCain. But in many areas of the South, especially rural ones, old prejudices still prevent someone from casting a ballot to put a black man in the White House. </p> <p>Experts say that, even if Obama does win some southern states, the achievement will fall far short of a revolution for the Democratic party. It will represent an opportunity to begin changing attitudes, not actual change itself. 'It will matter. But far less than a lot of people think,' said Bowler.</p> <p>Certainly some old attitudes die hard. Back in Greensboro, lawyer Steve Schlosser had put up a forest of Democratic signs in front of his house. Then last week someone came around at night, broke into his yard and took down the Obama-Joe Biden sign, leaving all the others untouched. </p> <p>'I think many of my fellow white North Carolinians are just not yet ready to vote for a black candidate,' Schlosser said. But the incident had not deterred him. He went right back to the Obama campaign office in Greensboro and got a new sign. He would still let his neighbours know who he was voting for.</p> <p>'Next time I hear someone come into my yard, I am going to let my dog go after them,' he said with a smile. 'And he's a pretty big dog.'</p>",
  "<p>The 2008 US presidential election is perhaps unique in having transformed global politics before the result is even known, for two reasons.</p> <p>First, there is the simple fact of Barack Obama's candidacy. There is no doubt that Mr Obama's campaign has been damaged by racist agitation - some discreet, some more overt. There are sections of American society that will clearly never be reconciled to the idea of a black President. But no Western European country has come so close to installing a non-white citizen to its highest office of state.</p> <p>Second, the eruption of a massive economic crisis in the middle of the campaign - and the candidates' different responses - has revived an argument about the nature and moral purpose of capitalism not seen for more than a generation. However different the British and American political systems and cultures may be, we can be sure those arguments will soon cross the Atlantic.</p> <p>It is Mr Obama who has responded to the global financial crisis with greater agility and confidence, and earned a substantial poll lead as a result. He backed the Republican-devised banking bail-out, while tailoring his own message to address voters' resentment at an incumbent administration that has been a loyal friend to the very rich. Roughly speaking, Mr Obama intends to raise taxes for relatively wealthy Americans, cut them for the middle classes and temporarily suspend them for businesses that create jobs.</p> <p>John McCain, by contrast, offered shrill, populist attacks on Wall Street's 'casino capitalism' without acknowledging that his own party built the casino. He favours corporate tax cuts and has accused Mr Obama of planning a 'redistribution of massive amounts of wealth' that amounts to 'socialism'.</p> <p>Both candidates have made spending promises that they would struggle to honour in office. Government revenues will shrink in a recession and a huge tranche of national wealth has just been diverted to shore up the financial system. To borrow David Cameron's favourite image of fiscal austerity, the cupboard is bare.</p> <p>Restocking that cupboard - or rather, finding a way to plug the gaping hole in public finances without putting yet more burdens on taxpayers or ramping up unsustainable levels of national debt - is one of the biggest policy challenges on both sides of the Atlantic.</p> <p>Mr Cameron is lucky that he can get away with simply describing the problem with a nifty metaphor. There is unlikely to be an election before 2010. While Gordon Brown's sure-footed handling of the immediate crisis has created a modest recovery in Labour's poll ratings, that temporary advantage could easily be eliminated in a long, ugly recession. </p> <p>The Tories are counting on the fact that Labour's long incumbency will do to Gordon Brown in 2010 what the Republicans' stewardship of the economy is doing to John McCain. Mr Cameron wants to be the candidate of change and renewal. Despite his party's traditional preference for Republican Presidents, the Tory leader would gladly see Barack Obama installed in the White House. That would at least demonstrate that inexperience is no bar to electoral success.</p> <p>But the awkward fact for Mr Cameron is that his handling of the financial crisis so far has more of the John McCain about it than the Barack Obama. The Conservatives, like the Republicans, are so steeped in pro-business, pro-market ideology that they struggle to find a coherent language to express solidarity with ordinary people who are both anxious about their own finances and outraged by government indulgence of the super-rich.</p> <p>The extraordinary rhetorical U-turns spun from pure political expediency that David Cameron and George Osborne have recently performed, attacking irresponsible bankers and exorbitant bonuses, sound like empty populism.</p> <p>Gordon Brown can reasonably be accused of hypocrisy in suddenly turning on the bankers whom he once assiduously courted. But he can also mobilise a language of social equality and fairness that is embedded in the political tradition from which he hails. He could feasibly now start looking at ways to mitigate the effects of a serious recession by transferring some wealth from the super-rich to the poor.</p> <p>Indeed, if Obama wins, and that is the course he takes, even the Tories could start talking about redistribution. That would really signal historic change.</p>",
  "<p>It must have been sometime in 1979, or maybe 1980, when I saw Freddie Toal on the evening news. I remember that I was sitting in the living room of a flat in Kensal Rise, north London with some friends, when someone shouted out his name and I looked up and there he was, bedraggled and barely recognisable; a lad from home. </p> <p>He was not someone I knew very well, but I distinctly remembered him from the early years of the Troubles when we had both been involved in the rioting that was part of daily life in the Nationalist areas of Armagh. Back then, Freddie Toal had longish black hair and wore the young, working class uniform of denim jacket and jeans. On the news that night, though, he was wearing only a blanket, and was standing in a cell in the Maze prison. His hair was long, his face gaunt and the walls around him were smeared with his own excrement. He looked familiar but utterly altered.</p> <p>'For a long time, when I was on the blanket, I had no real idea what I looked like,' he says, some 30 years later, his long hair now gone, his speech quiet and measured. 'The only time I ever saw my face was this one time when the screws were sweeping piss into our cells. The sun suddenly shone through the window and, for a few seconds, I saw my reflection in a pool of piss. It sounds funny but it took me a while to register it was me. I looked like a wild man.'</p> <p>In Steve McQueen's much anticipated film, Hunger, which opens at the end of the month, there is a scene that must surely have been based on that image: two young men, scared but defiant, standing in a shit-smeared cell. It is powerful but not nearly as haunting as the footage that inspired it. The film tells the story of Bobby Sands, the leader of the IRA hunger strike of 1981, and the most iconic Republican figure to emerge out of the Troubles. It does not tell the whole story though, ending instead at the moment of Sands's death. The nine men who followed his example are mentioned only in a footnote. The mass protest that attended their deaths is never alluded to, nor the murderous violence that occurred across the already beleaguered province at the time.</p> <p>Both Freddie Toal and his close friend, Sean McGerrigan, were in the Maze prison at the same time as Bobby Sands. Having seen the film, I wanted to hear their story. We arranged to meet in a community centre near the Roman Catholic cathedral in Armagh, the town that we all grew up in and where, to varying degrees, we were politicised by the early years of the Troubles. I never graduated beyond the rioting stage, though, nor did I embrace hardcore Republicanism. I guess I was too interested in girls and rock music, and could not wait to leave Armagh. And, besides, I was scared of guns, and of those that wielded them. Back then, the Brits - and the RUC - were the enemy but I did not hate them enough to even think about killing them. Nor did I really believe in dying for Ireland; it just did not enter my mind.</p> <p>At that time, you only found out for certain who was 'involved' when they were 'lifted' by the British army in a dawn raid, or went 'on the run' across the border, or, in some cases, were shot dead while on what the IRA called 'active service'. Freddie Toal was 20 when he was arrested on a dawn raid in 1977. He was subsequently charged with, as he casually puts it, 'possession of rifles and carrying out some knee-cappings in the town'. Sean McGerrigan followed him into the H Blocks the following year. He was just 17 when he was 'lifted' from his family house in nearby Callan Street in 1978; he was subsequently charged with attempted murder and possession of firearms. </p> <p>In a way, his arrest was not that surprising. His brother, Peter McGerrigan, whom everyone knew by his nickname, Jake, was shot dead by a single bullet fired by a British soldier on the Windmill Hill housing estate in 1973. He was the first IRA volunteer to be killed by the British army in Armagh. He was just 18 years old. 'Jake McGerrigan was the year above me in school,' remembers Freddie Toal. 'He was the first of my generation to die fighting for Ireland. At his wake, I knew I had to avenge his death. The first thing I did was join the Fianna \u00c9ireann [Young IRA]. Before that, I just rioted and threw stones, but then I wanted the gun. If you had told me back then, at 17, what was ahead of me, I would not have believed you.'</p> <p>The blanket protest was already under way when he entered the H Blocks in January 1977, and he went straight on it. In 1976 the British government had decided to phase out special category status for convicted terrorists as part of a bigger process known as 'criminalisation'. Both Republican and Loyalist prisoners, who had until then been granted special category status, were now to be treated as common criminals. The protest began on 14 September 1976, when Kieran Nugent, the first IRA man to be convicted for terrorist offences under the new policy, reputedly said to a prison guard: 'If you want me to wear that uniform, you're going to have to nail it to my back.' He was given a blanket and escorted to his cell. Other IRA prisoners followed his example, and in 1978 the mass blanket protest turned into the dirty protest when IRA prisoners refused to leave their cells following another violent dispute, this time over a demand for extra towels in the communal washrooms. The prisoners' policy of non-cooperation meant that they were often confined for days on end in their tiny concrete cells with just a blanket, a mattress and a Bible. Refusing to wash or slop out, they began emptying their urine out over the floor and smearing their excrement on the walls.</p> <p>Another emotive scene in Hunger shows two prisoners sleeping on dirty mattresses while maggots wriggle in the mounds of rotting food and excrement that have been pushed into the corners. Was it, I ask Toal, who remained on the blanket for four years, really that bad? 'It was worse,' he says. 'For years afterwards I had nightmares about it. I'd wake up drenched in sweat, thinking I was back there.' </p> <p>Back then, the most vivid description of their conditions came from Cardinal O'Fiaich, the then-Roman Catholic Primate of All Ireland, who visited the prison in 1978. 'I was shocked by the inhuman conditions prevailing in H Blocks 3, 4 and 5, where over 300 prisoners are incarcerated,' he said. 'One would hardly allow an animal to remain in such conditions let alone a human being.' O'Fiaich compared the H Blocks to 'the slums of Calcutta', adding: 'The stench and filth in some of the cells, with the remains of rotten food and human excreta around the walls, was almost unbearable. In two of them I was unable to speak for fear of vomiting.'</p> <p>His public statement prompted a response from the Northern Ireland Office, which began: 'These criminals are totally responsible for the situation in which they find themselves. It is they who have been smearing excreta on the walls and pouring urine through the cell doors. It is they who by their actions are denying themselves the excellent modern facilities of the prison.' </p> <p>The conflicting tone and message of those two statements, the one emotive and outraged, the other detached and clinical, prefigured the coming battle of wills between Republicans and the British state. In the eyes of the British government, led by Margaret Thatcher, the prisoners were simply murderers and gangsters and were to be treated accordingly. To the Nationalist population of Northern Ireland, who were becoming increasingly agitated about conditions inside the H Blocks, they were political prisoners standing up for a defining principle of Republicanism. To complicate matters further, word was filtering out of the Maze about the often violent ill treatment of the Republican Catholic prisoners by their mainly Loyalist Protestant prison officers.</p> <p>Toal and McGerrigan also talk quite calmly about the beatings they say they received 'on a regular basis' from their mainly Loyalist prison officers. They often occurred, they say, when they were being returned to their cells after Sunday Mass, or after a visit from someone on the outside.</p> <p>The IRA leadership inside the prison communicated with their counterparts on the outside through 'comms', tiny rolled up pieces of paper inscribed with minuscule writing that were secreted in prisoner's mouths, anuses, or underneath their foreskins. Toal describes how he was often 'grabbed by my hands and feet by four screws and spread over a mirror on the floor like a chicken, while a so-called medical officer officer stuck his fingers inside my ass.'</p> <p>Did they ever feel like giving in, abandoning their protest? 'What you have to understand was there was incredible camaraderie in there,' says McGerrigan. 'You always took strength from the fact that there were so many men on the protest. After a beating, the prisoners would often start singing Republican songs though the doors just to do the screws' heads in.' Toal concurs, though at times he has a haunted look when he talks about his experiences. 'It never entered my head to give up but I was always afraid of breaking under the beatings. You always had to be strong, not show weakness, keep your principles.'</p> <p>They tell me there were some 'decent screws' but that most of them were, as McGerrigan puts it, 'just plain sectarian'. One senior prison officer in the Maze at that time was a man called Paddy Joe Kerr, one of the few Catholics in the Northern Ireland Prison Service. He grew up close to where Sean McGerrigan did, and joined the prison service before the Troubles started. 'He had the power to stop the beatings but he never did,' says Toal. 'He was systemised against us,' adds McGerrigan. In 1985 Paddy Joe Kerr was shot dead by the IRA on the steps of Armagh cathedral as he and his young son were leaving Sunday Mass. </p> <p>By 1980 there were over 400 IRA prisoners on the blanket in the Maze and in Armagh women's prison. Their conditions and harsh treatment had now become a major focus of protest. More chillingly, the IRA had responded to the brutality inside the prison by targeting prison officers on the outside. By January of that year, 18 had been killed. As the dirty protest dragged on, and morale among the beleaguered prisoners began to waver, certain influential IRA men inside the H Blocks began to put pressure on the Army Council on the outside to be allowed to use the most extreme tactic of all: a hunger strike. </p> <p>The hunger striker has an almost mythological status in the annals of Irish Republicanism. Before 1981 the most celebrated hunger striker was Terence McSwiney, Lord Mayor of Cork, who died in Brixton prison in 1920 after 74 days. One part of his inaugural speech could just as easily have described the Republican mindset half a century later: 'The contest on our side is not one of rivalry or vengeance, but of endurance. It is not those who can inflict the most but those who can suffer the most who will conquer.' </p> <p>On 27 October 1980 the first IRA hunger strike inside the H Blocks began. It ended in confusion on 18 December in what the Irish writer and historian Tim Pat Coogan called 'a burst of prison poker, which the authorities at first believed they had won'. No lives were lost but Republican prisoners realised quickly that they had been outplayed, and that none of their demands for special category status had been met. In November the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, had spelt out the British government's stance: 'Let me make one point about the hunger strike in the Maze Prison. I want this to be utterly clear. There can be no political justification for murder or any other crime. The government will never concede political status to the hunger strikers or to any others convicted of a criminal offence in the province.' The stage was set for the second and final round of what would be a bloody and protracted battle, and one in which Thatcher would face someone even more intransigent than herself. </p> <p>Freddie Toal recalls the moment he met Bobby Sands. 'It was 18 December 1980, the day the first hunger strike ended. He came into our cell. I remember he was stroking his beard as he spoke and you could see by the look of him that he was shattered. There were screws behind him so he spoke in Irish. He just said \"Ni bhfuair faic\" (\"We got nothing\"). Then he told us that there was going to be another hunger strike, and this time it would be to the end. He said: \"I will lead it, and I will die.\" That was the last thing he said to us.'</p> <p>The second IRA hunger strike, which began on 1 March 1981, was planned by Sands to develop in ever more dramatic stages, one man following another to his death. Sands himself was the first to die after 66 days without food. By then he had become a British MP, having famously taken the Fermanagh and South Tyrone seat on 9 April 1981. In death he became, for a time at least, an icon. An estimated 100,000 people attended his funeral in Belfast on 5 May, streets were named after him in Paris and Tehran, and according to Tim Pat Coogan: 'The French government offered the Dublin government two gestures of solidarity, which Dublin declined. One was to boycott the British royal wedding, the other that President Mitterrand attend Bobby Sands's funeral.' </p> <p>Another nine IRA prisoners would starve themselves to death before the hunger strike was called off in October 1981. In the tense seven months it lasted, violence in Northern Ireland reached a pitch that recalled the dark days of the early Seventies: 61 people died, over half of them civilians, including a girl of 11 hit by a plastic bullet; 30 members of the security forces were killed by the IRA.</p> <p>I went home to Armagh for a short family visit in the late summer of 1981, and I can still remember the mood of dread, anger and simmering violence that seemed to have taken hold of the place. In a bar frequented by middle-class Catholics, school teachers, doctors and the like, I heard a collective hiss of pure hatred turn into a tumult of abuse when Margaret Thatcher appeared on the television in the corner. There was a cheer when the bar manager reached up and switched channels. Thatcher, it seemed, had galvanised the Catholic middle classes into voting for Sinn F\u00e9in. They have continued to do so, in ever-increasing numbers, ever since. </p> <p>Before the hunger strike, Sands had collected the names of over 70 IRA men who were prepared to fast until death. I ask Toal and McGerrigan if either of them considered putting their names forward. 'No, never,' replies McGerrigan. Freddie Toal just shakes his head. </p> <p>The following day I travelled up to Belfast to meet a man who did volunteer for the IRA hunger strike. His name is Pat Sheehan. He spent 55 days without food, and was approaching death when the hunger strike was called off, mainly because of intervention from relatives of the starving men. Sheehan is currently, he says, 'self-employed', and lives in a well-off, middle-class neighbourhood on the outskirts of west Belfast. He has a degree in philosophy, obtained while in the Maze Prison. The night before, he had watched Hunger, and was eager to talk about what he called 'the weird mixture of feelings it brought up'. </p> <p>Did the film, I ask, chime with his experiences of the H Blocks at that time? 'Most of the time, it did. The camaraderie was missing, though. But everything else was pretty accurate, the conditions, the beatings, the grimness of the blocks. It brought it all back.' </p> <p>Sheehan was arrested in February 1978 and charged with causing an explosion in the centre of Belfast. He received a 15-year sentence and moved to the H Blocks in March 1979. 'You were given a blanket and you went down to your wing,' he says, smiling at the memory. 'I was feeling apprehensive, a bit scared, and half expecting a beating from the screws as a welcome. It seemed very quiet, then I heard someone shout in Irish, \"New man on the block!\" and all hell broke loose. There was cheering and shouting and men banging the pisspots on the doors. I thought, the morale is high, the lads aren't cowed. It was,' he says, grinning, 'like walking out on to Croke Park to play for your county in an All-Ireland Final.' </p> <p>Sheehan said he put his name down for both IRA hunger strikes 'without hesitation'. He agrees now that this was 'a brutal thing to do' to his family. 'Absolutely, absolutely,' he says, nodding, 'but the thing was, and this came across in the film, we were absolutely focused. You had to be. So that nothing could deflect you.'</p> <p>When his parents and his older sister came to visit him, he waited for the right moment to break the news to his father. Instead, his father broke some bad news to him. 'He hung back after the others left, and whispered to me that my sister had just been diagnosed with leukemia and given five years to live. Looking back on it now,' he says, quietly, 'it might seem very callous of me to have gone ahead with a hunger strike in those circumstances, to take that decision when they were going through this awful moment. But I had made up my mind. I could not let the other men down.' </p> <p>How did his family react to his decision? 'They were devastated. Absolutely devastated. I can still remember the look on their faces when I told them. It was a terrible thing to see.' He says that his father 'became politicised during the hunger strike even though he was anti-violence to the day he died'. </p> <p>Nine men had already died when Sheehan began his hunger strike, and the 10th, Mickey Devine, died soon afterwards. 'In a way, you couldn't let their deaths affect you too much. I wasn't surprised when Bobby [Sands] died because we all knew he was going to go the whole way. It was more the inevitability of it that was terrible, but we stayed strong because we had to.'</p> <p>Was there a moment during his own hunger strike when he had any doubts about his decision? He thinks for a moment. 'Well, I was going into uncharted territory, so of course I had some doubts. Would I be able to carry it through to the end? I was as sure as I could be but, strangely enough, as time went on and I grew weaker physically, I became stronger psychologically until there was no doubt in my mind. Day by day, I became more certain.'</p> <p>Sheehan talks with remarkably little emotion of what he went through in the 55 days he inched closer to death. He says the worst part was 'the terrible realisation that you were not just feeling sick but becoming seriously ill, your own body rebelling against you'. In the last few days of his ordeal, he says, he was 'still lucid and very, very calm' but could only 'see shadowy, ghostly figures coming in and out of the room'. One of them was a doctor, who told him that even if he ended his fast, he would be permanently damaged and, in fact, might not even live. </p> <p>He tells me proudly that he has 'no lasting effects' from the hunger strike, and, in fact, 'recovered remarkably quickly'. In this, he is the exception: other surviving hunger strikers have had severe problems, usually with their eyesight and kidney function. Sheehan was 'almost totally blind' and 'lapsing in and out of unconsciousness' when the hunger strike was called off. A priest had granted him absolution, given him Communion, and performed the Last Rites over his bed. </p> <p>Can he describe how it felt to be pulled back from the brink of death? He sighs and shakes his head. 'To be honest, I had mixed emotions. On a purely personal level, I was glad that I had survived, but on another level I have to say I felt somehow disappointed, especially as the days went by and I received medical attention and started to recover. I think I had what is called survivor's syndrome. I felt guilty, definitely, about the lads who had died, about their families. And, in terms of the bigger political picture, I felt that stopping the hunger strike would demoralise and undermine the whole struggle.' </p> <p>The year after the hunger strike ended was, according to Sheehan, 'the most demoralising time for Republican prisoners'. Both Toal and McGerrigan had said the same thing. The following year, though, the prisoners had achieved all their aims, and more besides. Segregated from their Loyalist counterparts, and wearing their own clothes, they effectively ran the prison. 'When I was brought into prison in 1990,' the Republican activist and author Danny Morrison told me recently, 'a prison officer asked me if I had everything I needed. Then he said goodnight to me in Irish. Mad!'</p> <p>Why then, one has to ask, did those 10 men die? In one way, as Steve McQueen remarked recently: 'It was as if the whole history of the Troubles, and of Britain's relationship to Ireland, was distilled in that moment. It came down to two opposing and immovable forces: Margaret Thatcher and Bobby Sands.' Morrison, who was an envoy between the Sinn F\u00e9in leadership and the prisoners in 1981, concurs. 'I remember saying to Bobby, Thatcher will not back down. I came away knowing that his mind was set, too, though. He knew what he had to do and how it would end.' </p> <p>'Too long a sacrifice can make a stone of the heart', wrote WB Yeats in his poem, 'Easter, 1916', about the death by execution of Irish Republicanism's founding heroes, among them P\u00e1draig Pearse, whose belief in blood sacrifice and martyrdom seemed at the heart of the IRA hunger strike of 1981. In retrospect, though, the tumultuous events of that time and in particular the election of Bobby Sands, can be viewed as a pivotal moment in Republican thinking, when Pearse's dark ideology reached its terrible crescendo then finally faded. It was the moment when, to paraphrase Danny Morrison, belief in the ballot box began to replace belief in the bullet. Everything that has happened since, including the Good Friday Agreement and Sinn F\u00e9in members taking their places in the Northern Irish Assembly as democratically elected representatives, has emerged out of that terrible summer of 1981. </p> <p>'Things change very slowly,' says Sean McGerrigan, 'and not in the way you expect. People might say that those men died in vain, but they died as part of a greater struggle. There will be a United Ireland but not in the way we envisaged it happening years ago.' </p> <p>Freddie Toal nods his consent. 'It was inevitable what happened,' he says. 'The environment we grew up in politicised us, and the H Blocks politicised us even more deeply. And if you came though what we did on the H Blocks, you have a special bond with the other men who did the same. Maybe it's hard for you to relate to that, just as it is hard to understand why we had to take up the gun, or why someone would choose to starve themselves to death for a principle.' </p> <p>He is right, of course. I have not been through what they have been through. And, despite our shared upbringing, and all that has happened since, I still do not fully understand what drove them to take up the gun or fuelled their monumental endurance, their unshakeable certainty. Nor, though, can I understand why, whatever their reasons for being imprisoned, they were treated in captivity as if they were less than human. Perhaps that is the unanswered question that still echoes most loudly, and alarmingly, in our fragile democracy in these still troubled times. </p> <h2>The toll - Hunger's strike dead</h2> <p><strong>Bobby Sands, aged 27 </strong><br>1 March-5 May 1981 (66 days on strike)</p> <p><strong>Francis Hughes, 25 </strong><br>15 March-12 May (59 days)</p> <p><strong>Raymond McCreesh, 24</strong><br>22 March-21 May (61 days)</p> <p><strong>Patsy O'Hara, 23</strong><br>22 March-21 May (61 days)</p> <p><strong>Joe McDonnell, 29</strong><br>9 May-8 July (61 days)</p> <p><strong>Martin Hurson, 24 </strong><br>28 May-13 July (46 days)</p> <p><strong>Kevin Lynch, 25</strong><br>23 May-1 August (71 days)</p> <p><strong>Kieran Doherty, 25</strong><br>22 May-2 August (73 days)</p> <p><strong>Thomas McElwee, 23</strong><br>8 June-8 August (62 days)</p> <p><strong>Michael Devine, 27</strong><br>22 June-20 August (60 days)</p> <h2>Northern Ireland - a history of protest</h2> <p><strong>1965</strong> The Prime Ministers of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland meet for talks, a move which provokes tension among Unionists. </p> <p><strong>1966 </strong>Loyalist paramilitary group the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) forms in response to the perceived revival of the IRA, on whom they declare war.</p> <p><strong>1968</strong> Protests by the newly formed Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) descend into violence with loyalists attacking demonstrators.</p> <p><strong>1969</strong> <strong>12 August</strong> Simmering tensions erupt during the Battle of the Bogside which sees violent confrontations in Londonderry between police and nationalists and lasts three days.

  "<p>Winston Churchill once said that in wartime truth was so precious that it needed to be surrounded by a \"bodyguard of lies\". In America's presidential campaign \u2013 and, sadly, within Iraq itself nowadays \u2013 the Iraq war may not be surrounded by a bodyguard of lies, but it has certainly picked up a vast entourage of partisan half-truths, cynical indifference and uninformed stubbornness. </p> <p>America's Democrats continue to argue for complete withdrawal of US forces from Iraq within 18 months, despite the fact that no rational observer believes that Iraqi forces will by then be able to secure Iraq's borders and face down the country's numerous militias, which remain armed to the teeth. </p> <p>Indeed, the <a href=\"http://origin.barackobama.com/issues/iraq/\">Democratic plan</a> (if it can be called one) ignores Iran's ongoing subversion of Iraq's state institutions, which will continue unless and until they become strong enough to resist such machinations. Moreover, Barack Obama's insistence that Iraq has never constituted a central front in the war on terror insults the memory of the tens of thousands \u2013 perhaps hundreds of thousands \u2013 of Iraqi civilians and US troops murdered by al-Qaida's suicide bombers since 2003. Indeed, by 2004, the terrorists themselves regarded Iraq as the central front of their campaign. </p> <p>Nor can one be buoyed by Joseph Biden's repeated calls for a \"soft partition\" of Iraq, even though the entire Iraqi political class has rejected the notion. </p> <p>As for the Republicans, setting aside Sarah Palin's talk of America's divine mission in the war on terror, it is inconceivable that John McCain truly <a href=\"http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/Issues/fdeb03a7-30b0-4ece-8e34-4c7ea83f11d8.htm\">believes</a> that a US presence is sustainable in Iraq into the indefinite future. To be fair, McCain never suggested that US troops will wage 100 years of war, as some of his critics claim. What McCain was referring to was a peaceable presence of US forces in the country for a long period, rather like their continued presence in Japan since 1945. </p> <p>Still, even assuming that the American public would tolerate such a presence, the Iraqi public would not. America has made too many policy mistakes, US forces are too closely associated with an unpopular and incompetent occupation, and, until recently, their tactics have been too thuggish to permit talk of a permanent presence. </p> <p>While most Iraqis understand the need for US forces to be in their country for the short term, they will not abide a permanent deployment. McCain's advisors would do well to consider a historical precedent: the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/apr/19/iraq.arts\">failed British attempt</a> at the end of the first world war to maintain a long-term military presence in Iraq. </p> <p>Iraqi politicians have not been exempt from posturing for political gain. The government committed a number of blunders in its negotiations on the continued presence of US troops. Indeed, this summer it injected itself into the US elections by <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,566841,00.html\">seeming to endorse</a> Obama's plan for early withdrawal. Then again, for three consecutive years, Iraq's national security advisor \u2013 a physician with no credentials for the job when appointed by the US occupation authority, except that he spoke tolerable English \u2013 insisted that the next year would be the last in which American troops were needed. </p> <p>Iraq's government is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/13/iraq-military\">demanding</a> a withdrawal timetable from the US, not because it believes that Iraqi forces will be ready to take over soon, but to burnish its nationalist credentials ahead of next year's parliamentary elections. In this way it hopes to divert public attention from still nonexistent basic services, continuing sectarianism, weak oil production, scant infrastructure investment, and rampant corruption and cronyism. Whether this strategy will succeed in obscuring the government's record of failure in the minds of voters remains to be seen. </p> <p>The problem now for Iraqi and US politicians is that, to act rationally, they will need to face down elements within their own constituencies. They must recognize that a long-term presence by US troops is out of the question, but that US combat forces will be needed in Iraq \u2013 albeit with a diminishing role \u2013 for the next five years. Only such a presence can consolidate the palpable, but still reversible, gains made over the past year. </p> <p>Such a force is needed to continue pursuing al-Qaida, and to counteract pro-Iranian activities. Ending US involvement before the Iraqis can achieve these goals on their own would be disastrous for both US and Iraqi interests. In the meantime, US forces must support Iraqi efforts to strengthen the country's own military and security forces, while simultaneously disbanding all militias. </p> <p>Iraq's militias will not go quietly, yet their dissolution is essential for long-term stability, itself a sine qua non for stability in the region. When these missions are accomplished \u2013 but not sooner \u2013 US forces should withdraw from Iraq. </p> <p>\u0095 Feisal Amin Rasoul al-Istrabadi served as Iraq's ambassador and deputy permanent representative to the United Nations from 2004 to 2007.

  "<p>Zack Roth is doing a terrific job over at TPM on the Acorn \"voter fraud\" business. And I'm glad to see that the Obama campaign <a href=\"http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/10/obama_camp_connects_acorn_prob.php\">is publicly connecting the dots</a> between this current fake brouhaha over \"fraud\" and the US attorneys scandal of years past. They are intimately linked, and the Obama people really have to push back hard on this.</p> <p>Relatedly, here's my piece from today's formerly arboreal edition of the Guardian on this matter. I'll provide <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/18/uselections2008-barackobama1\">the important grafs</a> as a service, but you should be aware that your mother will be very hurt if you don't click through and read the entire thing:</p> <blockquote> <p>Republicans are bracing themselves for a John McCain loss. They probably don't believe that \"exposing\" large-scale fraud can salvage the election for them. But they may well be thinking along other lines.</p> <p>Suppose Barack Obama wins, but a narrower victory than expected. Say he gets 284 electoral votes, and that 20 of those 284 come from Ohio. Since 270 are needed to win, Ohio will be the difference between victory and defeat. And suppose the Ohio vote is outside the margin that automatically triggers a recount, as was the case in Florida in 2000, but is still moderately close - 3% or so.</p> <p>You can bet in such a case that the Republicans will challenge the result. They will find a few cases of people voting from the wrong address. Their propagandists on the Fox News channel will follow. They likely won't prevail, but the effort will have the crucial effect of casting doubt on Obama's legitimacy and impinging on his mandate.</p> <p>The Obama people know all this, which is why they're working for a margin that would make such challenges moot. </p> </blockquote> <p>OK. Now it's 11 am Saturday. Like any good liberal, I'm devoting my afternoon to golf and college football. <br></p>",
  "<p>I don't think newspaper endorsements really matter that much anymore unless they're really surprising. But it's worth keeping track of some of them. </p> <p>Obama got <a href=\"http://www.kansascity.com/endorsements/story/845717.html\">the Kansas City Star today</a>. I really have no idea of the Star's general leanings. Kansas City is, like many mid-American cities, a Democratic-leaning (but not socially liberal) urban area within larger pretty heavily Republican surroundings. Given that Missouri is neck-and-neck, I could imagine this endorsement mattering a little.</p> <p>The estimable Greg Mitchell at Editor &amp; Publisher keeps track of newspaper endorsements <a href=\"http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003875230\">here</a>. It's interesting reading for sure. Obama has 57 papers with 7 million-plus total circ, while McCain has 16 with 1.5 million.<br></p>",
  "<p>It's worth stepping back and just keeping in mind the electoral college math that's likely to be at work here.</p> <p>It now appears, emphasis on appears, that Obama has all the states John Kerry won pretty well nailed down. New Hampshire was in doubt for a while but doesn't seem to be now. Those states come to 252 electoral votes.</p> <p>It also appears that he has two 2004 Bush states pretty well locked up, Iowa and New Mexico. Iowa has been in the Obama category for a while. New Mexico hasn't, and you'll still see it called a swing state on TV, but Obama seems to have <a href=\"http://www.electoral-vote.com/\">a double-digit lead there now</a>. They give Obama another 12 electoral votes, for 264.</p> <p>That's just six EV's away. So, consider all these battleground states: Florida (27), Ohio (20), North Carolina (15), Virginia (13), Missouri (11), Indiana (11), Colorado (9). That's seven states. Obama needs to win just one of them -- any one of the seven puts him over the top. So looked at this way, the bottom really would have to fall out, especially given that he has narrow leads in about five of these states.</p> <p>I've seen McCain and Palin in Pennsylvania in the last week and thought, \"What are they still doing there?\" The <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/\">polls say</a> it's 10, 12, 15 points. </p> <p>But if you think of the electoral map, the importance of Pennsylvania to McCain is obvious. It's 21 EV's. If lightning could strike and he could somehow pick it off, then Obama has a more difficult path. So that's why he still hangs around there.</p> <p>I say all this because you will hear people say things like \"Can Obama win Ohio <em>and </em>Florida?\" or \"Can Obama carry half of these swing states?\" But, assuming he holds the Kerry states plus Iowa and New Mexico, he doesn't have to do those things.<br></p>",
  "<p>Sean Quinn of the indispensable site fivethirtyeight.com has been driving around the middle Atlantic and Appalachian regions. A couple of days ago he was in the dear old home town (Morgantown, West Virginia), and yesterday he was in a town called Washington, Pennsylvania, about 40 miles north of M'town on I-79. I know this turf quite well, obviously. We called Washington \"Little Washington,\" to distinguish it from the actual Washington--DC, which was close enough to be a familiar destination. </p> <p>Anyway, Sean heard <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/10/on-road-western-pennsylvania.html\">the following story</a> in this town where Obama got just slaughtered by Hillary Clinton:</p> <blockquote> <p>So a canvasser goes to a woman's door in Washington, Pennsylvania. Knocks. Woman answers. Knocker asks who she's planning to vote for. She isn't sure, has to ask her husband who she's voting for. Husband is off in another room watching some game. Canvasser hears him yell back, \"We're votin' for the n***er!\"</p> <p>Woman turns back to canvasser, and says brightly and matter of factly: \"We're voting for the n***er.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>I've heard similar stories from West Virginia, in which people openly use the n-word while saying they're voting for him.</p> <p>It's important not to read too much into this. It's mostly a reflection of the economy; McCain's ridiculous response to the crisis; Palin's presence. And clearly, part of it must be that Obama has come across to these folks as smart and steady and someone who'll use good judgment in office.</p> <p>I still doubt that Obama will carry West Virginia. But he's a lot farther along with these voters than I'd have thought back in April or May.<br></p>",
  "<p>Like many frustrated Democrats, the rhetoric of this election has made me angrier than I've been in a long time. But none of my previous agitation has matched the fury I felt during <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/16/us/politics/16debate.html?scp=1&amp;sq=third%20debate%20transcript&amp;st=cse\">Wednesday night's debate</a> when John McCain <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKNpHTmd8LE&amp;feature=related\">snidely responded to Obama's health care plan</a>, \"If you like that, you'll love Canada and England\". I became so enraged that I thought I was going to burst a blood vessel. But happily, I do live in England, so I wasn't worried about being able to afford to get a doctor to treat it. </p> <p>I took McCain's statement rather personally because I have lived in both Canada and England since leaving the US in 1999, and benefited not just from their universal health care systems, but from exposure to societies in which health care is rightly regarded as a human right that should be provided \u2013 and regulated \u2013 in the public sector, rather than managed by corporations. I have come to realise that it is the only civilised option. And yet America has managed to avoid it, until now, under the <a href=\"http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_plank/archive/2008/10/02/palin-channels-reagan.aspx\">guise of maintaining freedom</a>. <br> I was among the lucky ones when I lived in the US: my father worked for a large multinational corporation and his benefits package was decent. That said, when I was an asthmatic adolescent, my parents were sometimes paying hundreds of dollars a month, even with insurance, when I had to visit the doctor several times a week at $15 a shot and took six prescription drugs simultaneously. Coping with this added financial burden that was manageable, but not easily, for my middle-class one-income family. It would have been untenable for many of the families of the nearly five million American kids with asthma.</p> <p>We are all aware that Americans are increasingly cash-strapped, but now we're cutting back on health care \u2013 according to a current <a href=\"\" \"http: www.washingtonpost.com wp-dyn content article 2008 10 15 ar2008101503762.html\">Washington Post survey</a>, a quarter of Americans have skipped doctor's appointments because of the cost. Preventative tests are becoming luxuries for Americans. Long waiting lists here in the UK because of limited resources are one thing, but having to choose between having an MRI scan to look for tumours and paying your mortgage is quite another. This price is too high to pay for the so-called freedom of choice that McCain's health care is supposed to protect, especially when the $5K tax break that he is offering to help people for health care falls far short of the cost of insurance for most families, particularly if anyone has any kind of chronic illness. </p> <p>We Americans like to proudly say that our country's health care is the greatest in the world, and it is true that we have some of the best and most innovative treatment available, thanks to our top-class research institutes and hospitals. But the statistics are revealing and dispiriting: this great health care is simply not available to too many of the most vulnerable. One of the most stark examples? We have the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/PRESSROOM/07newsreleases/infantmortality.htm\">second worst infant mortality rate</a> in the developed world. Black mothers, who are poorer on average, are more than twice as likely than white mothers to lose babies as infants. In Baltimore, two districts divided by three miles and a large difference in average incomes <a href=\"http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/local/baltimore_city/bal-te.md.ci.death16oct16,0,3636975.story\">have been found this week</a> to have average life expectancies of 83 years and 63 years (guess which one is wealthier). </p> <p>Yes, the <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Pages/homepage.aspx\">National Health Service</a> has some serious flaws - last time I was at the doctor I looked over his shoulder and spotted on the computer a slightly embarrassing permanent note on my record that I was 'aggressive' because I once argued with a doctor who wouldn't prescribe a drug for my asthma that I was used to getting in the US. But ultimately, universal health care it is simply a more humane system \u2013 something you'd think that John McCain, who often cites his experience of inhumane treatment, might be in favour of. I'd rather contend with occasional NHS mediocrity and have the confidence that if I do have a severe illness (or for that matter, decide to have a baby) I'll be in safe hands and won't ever face bankruptcy trying to pay medical bills. John McCain, do I love Canada and England? You betcha'!</p>",
  "<p>Day 6. Talking to people and watching the media as we make our way across the Southwest, it sometimes feels as if the election is over and Barack Obama has nothing left to do but pack up for his move to the White House. Even as the Democratic nominee warns his legions not to get complacent, John McCain already looks like a sour old loser. Sarah Palin, once the emblem of right-wing populism, is all but invisible to anyone but the crowds who appear at her increasingly virulent rallies; about the only thing that can save her from oblivion is tonight's appearance on Saturday Night Live. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com\">Fivethirtyeight.com</a>, the hot projections site, is today projecting a veritable Obama landslide: 56.6 to 41.4 percent in the popular vote and 349.2 to 188.8 in the electoral college. It also says that Democrats could come out with a 15-seat lead in the Senate. RealClearPolitics, which averages all the national polls, is showing Obama with a more modest 6.9 point lead, but a stronger advantage in the electoral college. States like North Carolina and Nevada and even West Virginia, which McCain should have locked up long ago, are now classified as toss-ups. Four key states that Bush won last time\u2014Iowa, Virginia, Colorado, and New Mexico\u2014are at least leaning Democratic. </p> <p>In these and other swing states, Obama's disciplined ranks of youthful activists have invaded town after town. No one has seen this sort of political mobilization since the New Right rose to power in the Reagan Revolution in 1980.<br> Last night, after a 350-mile drive across the high desert from Sedona, Arizona, we entered the capital of the swing state among swing states: Albuquerque, New Mexico. In 2004, George W. Bush beat John Kerry here by just under 6,000 votes. In 2000, Al Gore beat Bush by only 366 votes. Before that, the state went for Clinton in his winning years, and George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan in theirs. According to RCP, Obama is now leading here by just over 8 points. </p> <p>The partisan breakdown varies wildly in different parts of the state: Down in the southeastern corner, on the Texas border, the Republican share of the vote can run as high as 70 to 80%; in the northern mountains, around wealthy, New Age Taos, the split is just the opposite. Bernalillo County, where we are now, is the most populous in the state, with more than 600,000 residents. It is also key to Obama's strategy this year. The campaign's aim is to run up such wide margins here (15,000-20,000) that McCain can't catch him even if he does well further south. And the Democrats aren't conceding the south, either, as Joe Biden arrived in the state for a rally down in Mesilla.</p> <p>Joe Monahan, the savvy local blog editor who runs <a href=\"http://www.joemonahansnewmexico.blogspot.com/\">New Mexico Politics with Joe Monahan</a>, points out the Latinos make up a substantial slice of the population in New Mexico, some 44%. They are trending strongly toward Obama, but <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-newmexico16-2008oct16,0,3999043.story\u2014by \">a fifth remain undecided some accounts</a>, because of the conflict between progressive economic positions and conservative social views. The GOP's position in this community wasn't helped by the unexpected demise of Bernalillo County Republican Party chairman Fernando C. de Baca, who stepped down last month after telling a BBC reporter: \"The truth is that Hispanics came here as conquerors. African-Americans came here as slaves. Hispanics consider themselves above blacks. They won't vote for a black president.\" </p> <p>Native Americans are a higher percentage of the total here than in any other state, though still only about 10%. With margins as small as they have been in recent years, however, the <a href=\"http://nativetimes.bizweb5.tulsaconnect.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=195&amp;Itemid=28\">Native American vote could make a difference</a>. They usually voting in low numbers, but Obama has opened a campaign office on the Navajo reservation, and more near Pueblo and other Indian communities, and has won the endorsement of many tribal leaders. </p> <p>There is a solid McCain vote among those who work for Sandia Laboratories and on Kirkland Air Force base, and in much of the south, Joe Monahan says--but even there, cracks have appeared in a once-reliable Republican base. And the Democrats have registered some 35,000 new voters, far outstripping the Republicans\u2014though the \"voting fraud\" challenges have already begun here, as they have in other battleground states. (I'll be writing more vote about suppression tactics in New Mexico tomorrow.)</p> <p>All this may explain why the GOP is flying in Sarah Palin, who is to appear on Sunday at an airport hangar in Roswell. Maybe she can put things back together again, or at the very least stem the Obama tide. Roswell is of course notorious as the site of a supposed UFO crash in 1947, that left behind spaceship debris and alien corpses. (The U.S. military said the debris was from an experimental surveillance balloon, but believers insist this was a cover story.) </p> <p>With our editors working late into the night, we'll be posting two new videos tomorrow. Part of our team has already headed out for Colorado Springs, to take a look at its famous evangelical Christian community, and the rest of us will be following tomorrow, north on Route 25. But along the way we'll be stopping off in Santa Fe and some smaller towns, to check out the rallies and marches taking place all over New Mexico, aimed at getting people to take part in early voting, which begins tomorrow in locations all over the state.</p>",
  "<p>The availability of more powerful computing means that we can all watch the US election, and particularly the effect of changes in polls, in something approaching real time - at least, as fast as the data from the polls can be pulled in.</p> <p>There are three notable sites where you can see what's going on, and to me it's hard to put a paper between them: so (in alphabetical order) <a href=\"http://www.270towin.com/\">270towin.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/\">FiveThirtyEight.com</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/maps/obama_vs_mccain/\">RealClearPolitics</a> (which provides polling data for our <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/uselections2008\">US Election 08 coverage</a>; hey, look, there they are on the right!).</p> <p>Both run Monte Carlo simulations using the latest poll data to predict who will win the US election. That means that you don't always get the same result - if you try the <a href=\"http://www.270towin.com/simulation/\">270towin simulator</a> twice in a row then you'll get two different answers.</p> <p>But, because it's a Monte Carlo simulation, it will trend around an indicative average of what you would expect in the one-off of real life. (In brief: a Monte Carlo simulation rolls the dice, or spins the roulette wheel, on a given chance-driven situation; you get a stack of results. With a fair roulette wheel, you'd expect to see every number come up equally; with two dice, you'd expect it to <a href=\"http://www.planease.com/product/analysis/risktx.aspx\">cluster around a value of seven</a>.</p> <p>(One of the fun - and scary - things is to look at the past choices that US states made in previous presidential elections.)</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/\">FiveThirtyEight.com</a> also acts as a sort of political blog, but has lots of maps - including the <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/maps/obama_vs_mccain/?map=17\">remarkable result from 1984</a>, when Reagan got 525/538 of the \"electoral college\" votes while getting 60% of the votes, and <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/maps/obama_vs_mccain/?map=20\">the amazing one from 1972</a>, when Nixon got 62% of the votes cast but 520 \"electoral college\" votes. And then there's 2000, when.. oh no, let's not. Which goes to show how the first-past-the-post system, as used in the US states - and here, since you mention it - can distort things. (The 270towin site shows how many actual votes were cast.)</p> <p>Any other sites we should know about?</p>"
