  "<p>Earlier this week, Michael Moore put his Slacker Uprising online for Americans to download free. On its heels comes another get-out-and-vote movie, this one a comedy starring Kevin Costner as a beer-drinking waster called Bud who gets the deciding vote in the US election after an electronic voting glitch. It wasn't even him in the polling booth, either, but his civically minded 12-year-old daughter, while Bud was passed out; this makes for some glutinously sentimental family drama. But away from the cutesy stuff there are some surprisingly sharp digs at the political process, with Kelsey Grammer as the incumbent Republican president and Dennis Hopper playing his Democrat challenger. This pair never look so grubby as when they're sucking up to Bud, holding their noses while they do it, and furiously U-turning on everything from immigration to gay marriage to win him over. But the basic message puts the handcuffs on anything too risky. Bud is just a Frank Capra little guy, reminding politicians that deep down we all want things to be a bit, well, less bad.</p>",
  "<p>This British piano virtuoso runs a sublime, somewhat Brad Mehldau-inspired trio - but he is a fearsome unaccompanied player, too. These two albums of contrapuntal improvisations may bring Keith Jarrett's K\u00f6ln Concert to mind. However, devotees of classical piano may be drawn by Law's elegiac and flawlessly stroked slow explorations of chord voicings. He doesn't hide the years of detailed preparation that have gone into his music, so you don't get Mehldau's deceptively lazy, slow-burn restraint, or a loose deployment of the left-hand ostinatos that Law tends to keep remorselessly tight. But the Englishman can still be light and playful - as on the rocking Zero-G, which suggests early, hard-swinging Abdullah Ibrahim. The Last Dance gently explores twangy prepared-piano; Fair Weather Friend features a boogie feel, Monkish chordal jolts and swing-style trills; and the three-part Little Suite is a lovely display of Law's classically immaculate sense of form and contrast. There is little to choose between the albums, though volume two might just clinch it for variety.<br></p>",

The presidential debate, still scheduled for tonight in Oxford, Mississippi, provides the first opportunity for voters to see John McCain and Barack Obama together and finally make up their minds.</p> <p>Almost 20% of the electorate are still undecided, according to opinion surveys, and both Democratic and Republican pollsters agree that the debate, set to attract a record television audience, could settle doubts about the two candidates. </p> <p>In a rare show of consensus, the pollsters agree that the main question Obama has to deal with is whether, given his lack of experience, he is credible as commander-in-chief. The main question about McCain is whether he represents a continuation of President George Bush's administration, which would be fatal for his hopes.</p> <p>What gives the debate an extra edge is that neither Obama nor McCain, though good communicators, are good debaters. The debate has been further complicated by McCain's political manouevring in the last 48 hours, which has given the Republican candidate an extra edge.</p> <p>Looking at previous debates, Professor Alan Schroeder, author of Presidential Debates: Fifty Years of High-Risk TV, said: \"We never know what is going to happen in live events. The outcome is often different from what we anticipated.\" The debates offered a rare opportunity to see the candidates when they were not sticking carefully to prepared speeches, he said. \"We get a little more sense of the individual and how he behaves under pressure.\"</p> <p>The topic for the first debate was switched, as a result of Obama's lobbying, from domestic policy to foreign affairs, mainly because his team was well aware that the biggest question would be the commander-in-chief one - and that most floating voters would make up their mind during the first of the three debates.</p> <p>Obama has been preparing hard for this, refining his arguments on Iraq (he opposed the invasion), on Iran (he is prepared to negotiate directly with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad), and a host of other foreign policy issues.</p> <p>But the debate, despite the topic, will also be about the economy and McCain will claim that he, rather the Democratic candidate, demonstrated leadership on that issue this week by calling on Obama to suspend political campaigning and join McCain in helping to get a government bail-out plan through Congress. </p> <p>Daniel Schnur, McCain's communications director during the 2000 campaign for the Republican presidential nomination against George Bush, sees the debate as more important for Obama than McCain. \"To a large degree, this first debate is about Obama. Voters are intrigued. They are not sure he can handle the challenges. In 90 minutes, he will have the chance to reassure voters that he is comfortable and capable with these issues. I think the first debate will be decisive.\"</p> <p>Schnur said McCain could not allow Obama to glide through the debate. He compared the debate to the 1980 one when Ronald Reagan, like Obama, had to persuade voters he was up to the job. \"Reagan did not dazzle or dominate, but he reassured voters he could handle high office. It is not a high bar for Obama, unless McCain can throw him off his game.\" </p> <p>Can McCain convince voters he will not be a continuation of Bush? Schroeder said Bush would be \"lurking as a backdrop to this debate\". While McCain would distance himself as much as possible from the president, he expected Obama to raise the Bush question as often as he could. </p> <p>McCain is one of the few Republicans who can argue with some conviction - given his history as a party dissident - that he offers different policies from those pursued by Bush during the past eight years. </p> <p>Although it is a hard sell, given public antipathy towards Bush and the Republican party, McCain is presenting himself as a vehicle for change and reform. Republican-leaning analysts argue that making Sarah Palin his vice-presidential candidate has helped in terms of making him look plausible as an agent for change. </p> <p>On the downside for McCain is the image he will present on stage. McCain is 72 and looks it, in contrast with Obama, at 47. Schroeder said: \"McCain looks like a man whose time has come and gone. Obama has the advantage of youth.\"</p> <p>Stan Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, and his opposite number on the Republican side, Neil Newhouse, in a joint briefing with journalists in Washington last week agreed about the importance of the two themes: Obama as commander-in-chief, and fears of McCain as a continuation of Bush. Both agreed that whoever won the argument would be the next president.</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>For the University of Mississippi, the presidential debate is an opportunity to show the world it has moved beyond its painful<strong> </strong>place in America's <strong>civil rights struggle</strong>. Ole Miss, as the Oxford, Mississippi school is known, became the focus of world attention in <strong>1962 </strong>when <strong>segregationist students </strong>and public officials violently resisted a black man's effort to attend the university. Today the man, <strong>James Meredith</strong>, is recognised as a hero. By 1961 state schools had been desegregating, but Meredith, an Air Force veteran, was denied admission to the University of Mississippi. He sued, alleging he had been turned down because of his race. A federal court ruled in his favour and he <strong>risked his life </strong>to become the first black man to attend. Governor Ross Barnett and white students opposed his matriculation, and Meredith was threatened with death. President John Kennedy sent <strong>federal troops </strong>to protect him. In the ensuing riots dozens were injured and two were killed. The school is now known for its football team and research institutions.</p> <h2>First debate</h2> <p><strong>Tonight, Mississippi</strong></p> <p>Focus on foreign policy. Obama and McCain will be standing behind podiums answering questions from moderator Jim Lehrer of PBS television. The red lights and buzzers that signalled time limits in past years are gone, so Lehrer will have to strictly ration the candidates' time during the five-minute \"discussion period\" after each question.</p> <h2>Second debate </h2> <p><strong>October 7, Tennessee</strong></p> <p>A freewheeling \"town-hall\" format with both men free to roam the stage during their two-minute answers. Undecided voters from all walks of life, chosen by the Gallup polling firm, will be called on by NBC anchor Tom Brokaw to question the candidates on any subject matter.</p> <h2>Third debate </h2> <p><strong>October 15, New York City </strong></p> <p>Focus on domestic issues such as healthcare and education. Obama and McCain will be sitting round a table as they take questions from CBS anchor Bob Schieffer, who will also have to cut off the candidates if they exceed the time allotted for each question. </p> <p><strong>Elana Schor in Washington</strong></p>",
  "<p>John McCain was accused last night of sabotaging the Wall Street bail-out with theatrics that reduced America's credit crisis to a showcase for his presidential leadership capabilities.</p> <p>The furious words for the Republican candidate came after a contentious meeting at the White House between George Bush and congressional leaders scuppered an early deal on a $700bn rescue package. Both McCain and Barack Obama attended the meeting.</p> <p>The extraordinary session had been called after McCain's stunning announcement on Wednesday that he would suspend his campaign and would seek a delay in tonight's presidential debate to try to personally help steer through a deal on the bail-out. By midday yesterday, congressional leaders said they had reached the outlines of a deal.</p> <p>But that optimism appeared to have dissipated after the White House meeting.</p> <p>Democrats and Republicans said that prospects for a deal vanished after McCain had tried to prod his fellow Republicans in another direction. The breakdown cast new uncertainty over Friday night's presidential debate in Mississippi, as well as the future of the bail-out itself.</p> <p>McCain told ABC television last night that members of Congress still had legitimate concerns about the bill. But he added that he remained \"hopeful\" of a deal that would allow him to go ahead as planned with the debate.</p> <p>Obama had said earlier he would attend the debate, and the University of Mississippi, which is hosting the event, said it intended to go ahead.</p> <p>But both candidates planned to spend the night in Washington, where the last-minute uncertainty about the bail-out saw Democrats erupting in fury at McCain. Democratic leaders accused the Republican of engineering the drama to distract from his recent dip in the polls.</p> <p>\"What this looked like to me was a rescue plan for John McCain,\" Christopher Dodd, who heads the Senate's banking committee, told CNN.</p> <p>Obama also chided McCain. \"When you start injecting presidential politics into delicate negotiations you actually start creating more problems,\" he said.</p> <p>The attacks appeared to be a strategy to block McCain's efforts to cast himself as above the political fray when it came to America's credit crisis. McCain has depicted the bail-out negotiations as a crisis requiring his personal attention.</p> <p>\"I'm an old navy pilot, and I know when a crisis calls for all hands on deck,\" he said in a speech to the Clinton Global Initiative in New York, before travelling to Washington. \"As of this morning, I suspended my campaign. With so much on the line, for America and the world, the debate that matters most right now is taking place in the United States Capitol - and I intend to join it.\"</p> <p>Obama continued to reject McCain's argument that the gravity of America's financial crisis should put the campaign on hold. \"Our election is in 40 days,\" he said in his speech to the Clinton initiative, delivered from Florida where he was preparing for the debate. \"The American people deserve to hear directly from myself and Senator McCain about how we intend to lead our country. The times are too serious to put our campaign on hold, or to ignore the full range of issues that the next president will face.\"</p> <p>However, McCain did not even arrive in Washington until after Democratic and Republican leaders announced they had the outlines of a rescue package. He admitted as recently as Tuesday he had not taken the time to even read the plan, according to an NBC transcript distributed by the Obama camp.</p> <p>But that did not stop the Republican from seizing the headlines for two days in a row. McCain first wrong-footed Obama on Wednesday with his stunning announcement he would suspend his campaign and would not attend the debate.</p> <p>Yesterday, he struck again, appropriating Obama's conditions for the rescue deal - barely 24 hours after rejecting them. The Democrat proposed the conditions in discussions with McCain on Wednesday about a joint statement on the crisis.</p> <p>The Obama camp had called for an independent oversight board, a mechanism to protect taxpayers, a curb on outsized payments to Wall Street executives, and relief for homeowners faced with losing homes. The proposed joint statement also rejected attaching other measures, or earmarks, to the bill. In his speech yesterday McCain adopted near identical language - as well as the essence of four of the measures: an oversight board, protection for taxpayers, controls on Wall Street executives and a ban on earmarks; he made no mention of relief for homeowners.</p> <p>McCain's urgency for reaching a deal comes after polls suggested the economic crisis was eroding Republican support.</p>",
  "<p>Backstage after a Prada show is as close as most of us fashion editors will ever get to reporting from a war zone. It is crowded and hot, everyone is shouting in different languages and we are constantly at risk of being knocked to the ground, although that's mainly because we wear ridiculous shoes and the models are so tall that they tend to barge past without actually seeing us. Prada gets the coveted end-of-the-day slot, so we're hungry, although there are waiters with trays of champagne and miniature cucumber sandwiches a few metres away: if only we were wearing more comfortable footwear and didn't have to lean against a wall for support. All in all, it's a lot like how I imagine Baghdad, only there are more canapes.</p> <p>The reason we put ourselves through what is tantamount to a living hell is to hear what Miuccia herself has to say about her show, life, the universe. Because Milan fashion week is for the most part so brazenly commercial, the industry relies on Mrs Prada to put some soul into an event that can otherwise seem like a colour-by-numbers exercise in clothes with lowest-common-denominator hanger appeal. I feel quite sorry for the poor thing, to be honest. She designs all these incredible clothes, gets the models out on to the catwalk, takes her bow, and then, just when she is most likely looking forward to ordering a pizza and catching up with last week's Strictly Come Dancing, a bunch of crazy women turn up backstage asking her to explain the meaning of life. </p> <p>So anyway, there we all were, on Tuesday evening, and this is what she had to say. </p> <p>\"The idea is to get back to what women really care about. What we are obsessed by; what we primitively want. Bras, panties, python, gold ...\" There is something about primitivism and fish paintings that I can't make head or tail of, but then she returns to how she wanted \"to clean up the details, the fuss, to think about what women really want above all else\".</p> <p>Now, this sounds completely barking written down but I think that, as usual, she's on to something. These are nervous times, and no one quite knows what the world will feel like (McCain or Obama?) come February, when these clothes hit the shops. After years of breeziness our jobs, businesses and homes all feel on shaky ground. Nonetheless, the timing of the retail-fashion cycle dictates that we as an industry have to make a call on the spring mood now. So the only sensible thing to do is to try to figure out what women will always desire, when push comes to shove, through good times and bad. Forget the dilemma of what you would save if your house was on fire. The question Milan fashion week wanted you to answer was: if Rome was burning, what would you still shop for?</p> <p>As far as the Prada collection goes, I wrote in my notebook that the crumpled silk skirt-suits, the visible bras, the fuzzy, over-hairsprayed chignons were cinq-\u00e0-sept meets warts-and-all, kind of like Belle de Jour remade by Mike Leigh - alluring and salacious but gritty and troubling at the same time. Womenswear Daily described the Prada show as Mad Men meets Mad Max, which is a far neater way of saying much the same thing. There is a certain bitterness to these clothes: the nostalgia is of the glass-half-empty kind.</p> <p>So Miuccia Prada believes that what women care most passionately about in their wardrobe is underwear, precious metals and animal skin. The rumpled surfaces of the clothes suggest that she does not think we are all that committed to keeping up with the ironing, which is absolutely fine by me. </p> <p>At Burberry, Christopher Bailey is feeling the same way: crumpled linens and crinkled silks lent a careworn note to a collection in which the trench was stripped of its pomp. Epaulettes were flatter and more discreet, buttons matt rather than shiny, belts jettisoned in favour of cape and A-line shapes. It felt more Burberry-esque to me (perhaps just because it was more English) than the high-shine, power-luxe collections of recent seasons. And it played well with the mood of the week, where all over town it was dress-down Friday again and again: clothes a little looser, hair a little less done. </p> <p>This being Milan, usually positively Newcastle-esque in its commitment to showing as much flesh as humanly possible at all times and never mind the chill, there was an unusual abundance of outerwear. If the past two summers are anything to go by, then for the British market at least this makes sound commercial sense. For a summer trench, you could choose from Burberry's crumpled chic or the almost liquid black silk trench from Jil Sander, whose collection was definitely a highlight of the week. Giorgio Armani had pretty much every style of jacket you could ever want, all as perfectly cut as you would expect from the city's resident jacket maestro, from slinky cropped styles with tuxedo points in front to richly embroidered evening jackets. At Missoni, long-line jackets were unstructured in the shoulder but tightly belted; at Moschino, jewel-bright summer duster coats were worn over contrasting bright dresses. At D&amp;G, the shrug-on Chanel-style boxy jacket was given an Italian \"pop\" makeover (and worn with hotpants rather than a sensible skirt).</p> <p>At Marni, the transparent mac worn over a pencil skirt and wool tights veered, as Marni sometimes can, perilously close to making the model look like someone you would hesitate to sit next to on public transport. On the whole, though, the label pulled off the perverse elegance that is its trademark: Rothko-esque squares of bleeding colour on silk dresses and virtuoso combinations: aubergine with lemon, tobacco with Hubba Bubba pink. Overall, the hot colour of the week was sky blue - make of that what you will - which appeared everywhere from Gucci and Roberto Cavalli to Alberta Ferretti, Sportmax and Burberry. </p> <p>There is consensus about one thing for next season: shoes. It's all about an ankle-cuff sandal. This is like an ankle-strap sandal, except the strap round the ankle is extra wide. We saw them on the catwalk at Sportmax, Jil Sander and Gucci; on the front row Virginie Mouzat, the extremely chic fashion editor of Le Figaro, was already wearing them. But the best came at Salvatore Ferragamo - gold, white or nude sandals with double or triple straps around the ankle balanced with a chunky platform and textured, knobbly heels that reminded me of the dinosaur spines in the Natural History Museum. As soon as they came down the catwalk, I knew what I really, really wanted next season.</p>",
  "<p>\"You can't beat the market.\" That one slogan epitomises the conventional wisdom that has prevailed since the 1970s. This week, however, the US government convinced Congress that it was right, and the market was wrong. The treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, pleaded with representatives to hand over $700bn to buy securities that private investors have decided are worthless in the hope of rescuing banks saddled with the toxic assets. Charged with throwing good money after bad, the authorities insisted that market prices were wrong, arguing that taxpayers can expect to turn a profit when prices return to an appropriate value.</p> <p>Only days ago this pitch would have been treated as dangerous heresy, dismissed as reflecting the delusion that the bureaucracy knows best. The times, however, are a-changing. After the collapse of one bank and the fire-sale of others, the real delusion turns out to be blind faith in laissez-faire. On Wednesday the US president took to the airwaves to warn that avoiding economic Armageddon relied on securing the scheme. There are moments, in the words of one acute observer of capitalism, when all that is solid melts into air. Previously entrenched ideas are now evaporating fast, and the signs last night were that Congress had bought the deal - but only after much horse trading which had further diluted the purity of America's free-market system.</p> <p>Conservatives represented one half of the unholy Congressional alliance that initially frustrated the plan. The rightwing senator Richard Shelby complained that it took the US down the road of dirigiste France. Progressives populated another flank of resistance. They were reluctant to write blank cheques for the rich; a reluctance reinforced by news that the bankruptcy courts had released $2.5bn to secure Lehman Brothers bonus payments at a time when savers are still losing out. But the opportunity cost of the bail-out was the biggest sticking point. The $700bn bill represents a quarter of a full year's federal revenue, a vast outlay which will constrain the capacity of a potential Barack Obama presidency to deliver on priorities such as healthcare. Mr Obama and his Republican rival, John McCain, yesterday held a joint meeting with President Bush to project a united response to the economic peril. But Mr Obama was quite right to reject Mr McCain's calls to postpone planned debates between them until the financial deal was brokered. Its brokering was, quite properly, a highly political business.</p> <p>Despite yesterday's surge in shares, this week's record interbank lending rates are a reminder that finance is beset by a perilous lack of confidence. The system could come crashing down and, if it did, cleaners and cooks would feel the pain as much as wealthy bankers. But a great deal turns on the emerging small print of the deal. Hand in hand with help for holders of bad mortgage debt, there must be assistance for mortgage borrowers facing foreclosure. The fantastically vague Paulson scheme needed fleshing out to ensure it did not exempt reckless financial managers from punishment. After all, as the US economist Allan Meltzer has argued, capitalism without failure has no more bite than religion without sin. To ensure taxpayers share rewards as well as risks, the scheme must give them an equity stake in every bank supported. The package must also get a grip on fat-cat bonuses. A year ago the US administration rejected even the anaemic shareholder discipline on pay found in the UK. But this week, even before last night, Mr Paulson, himself a former bonus beneficiary, had acknowledged that popular anger about top pay must be answered with legislation.</p> <p>Mr Paulson was right to argue that something big needs to happen. Size isn't everything, though. His plan tackles a pressing financial problem. But it falls to Congress to ensure that it does not become a riot of the rich.</p>",
  "<p>The titles of two artistic memoirs offer useful slogans for the central struggles in current politics. For a book in which he looked back on a spell of divorce, dental reconstruction and bereavement, Martin Amis chose the title Experience, wryly invoking the popular theory that it is an advantage to writers to have suffered some events. Meanwhile, the late BBC cultural commissar Sir John Drummond labelled his recollections Tainted by Experience, a phrase allegedly used by a reforming director general to explain why Drummond's vision for the BBC was not to be trusted.</p> <p>These literary references book-end the dilemma of Gordon Brown and John McCain. In rejecting the alternative offered by whippersnapper politicians, each states experience as if it were a virtue in itself. Opponents argue that these experiences have tainted them.</p> <p>All political campaigns must strike a balance between past achievement and future potential. A leader who seems all yesterday is vulnerable to the charge of having stayed too long; but one who projects only tomorrow equally risks the allegation of having run too soon.</p> <p>The UK's two most recent PMs offer contrasting examples. Because our system has recently tended towards long stretches of single-party rule, Tony Blair gained power with no previous cabinet office, as David Cameron, if elected, will also be forced to do. Brown, though, boasted 10 years in the second most significant ministry, a de facto British vice-presidency. The political fates of the two men suggest that external factors - televisual chemistry, economic and political cycles - matter rather more than internal familiarity with sitting at big desks.</p> <p>Even so, the belief that experience matters has still shaped the present White House race, despite the fact that either outcome will result in the first leader without executive experience since the elevation of Senator Kennedy in 1960. In dashing back to Washington, with the promise of using his long-accumulated influence on Capitol Hill to achieve a financial rescue package, the veteran Arizona senator aims to pull political rank over the junior member from Illinois. The manoeuvre, though, is dangerous because playing this card invalidates McCain's already ambitious claim to be an outsider running against Washington business-as-usual.</p> <p>This is a perfect example of the trap that comes from running on experience: the more you promote what you know, people are directed to what you did. This is the same snare that snaps at Brown's ankles. His application to be kept in his job depends almost wholly on his Treasury experience, but it's an impossible proposition that his actions as chancellor resulted only in the good times while having no responsibility for the bad. Emergency economic circumstances have left McCain and Brown both advancing the riskiest of all political pitches: that the guy who dug you into the hole is the guy to dig you out.</p> <p>The problem for voters is that the ideal leader is someone who is fire-tested but not burnt out. Yet the political cycle tends to throw up candidates who have either taken much less or much more heat than that. And so, lacking the perfect option, an electorate may conclude that raw meat is preferable to that which is past its sell-by.</p> <p>To borrow a phrase from another branch of daylight robbery, the difficulty for both Brown and McCain is that they have too much previous. Were they running against a Kenneth Clarke or a John Kerry, such baggage would be neutralised on the scales. But the threat from younger contenders promising new starts has forced them to keep waving their suitcases of stale legislation and yellowed speeches. But as Amis and Drummond discovered, in asserting that a long past merits a future, they are getting ahead of themselves.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Kgalema Motlanthe was sworn in as South Africa's president yesterday, putting allies of Jacob Zuma firmly in control of the government after they toppled Thabo Mbeki at the weekend. </p> <p>After a week of the most dramatic political upheaval since the collapse of apartheid, which saw a sitting president swept out of power in a matter of days, Motlanthe sought to reassure South Africans and the financial markets that there would be no dramatic policy changes. </p> <p>The new president pledged to maintain Mbeki's business-oriented economic strategy which has been criticised by many of Zuma's backers, including the unions and Communist party, potentially opening the way for further strife within the ruling African National Congress. </p> <p>\"Mine is not the desire to deviate from what is working. It is not for me to reinvent policy. Nor do I intend to reshape either cabinet or the public service,\" Motlanthe told parliament after his inauguration. \"In a turbulent global economy, we will remain true to the policies that have kept South Africa steady, and that have ensured sustained growth.\"</p> <p>That assurance was reflected in Motlanthe's cabinet which retained many former ministers including Trevor Manuel as finance minister. His resignation after Mbeki was removed sent the Johannesburg stock exchange and rand plummeting as investors feared the loss of the world's longest-serving finance minister, who has overseen continuous economic growth. </p> <p>Manuel said he had merely offered his resignation to allow the president flexibility in choosing his cabinet. But others saw the move as a warning against any significant policy change, despite the pressure from the left, that appears to have been responded to in Motlanthe's speech. </p> <p>Perhaps the most important cabinet change was the removal of Manto Tshabalala-Msimang as health minister. She fronted Mbeki's heavily criticised HIV/Aids policies, blocking the distribution of life-saving drugs in public hospitals and drawing derision at international conferences by suggesting garlic and lemon as a suitable treatment. </p> <p>The leaders of other political parties praised Motlanthe as a man of integrity, humble and hardworking. Pieter Mulder of the mostly Afrikaner Freedom Front-Plus, alluded to the possibility that Motlanthe could supplant Zuma, who is the ANC president, as the party's candidate for president in May's general election. He told parliament a story of two Afrikaner voortrekkers who harness their oxen in the dark only to discover in the morning that they had also harnessed a lion. </p> <p>Their problem, said Mulder turning towards the new president, was that having harnessed the lion they now had to find a way to let it go. The story provoked much laughter and a smile from Zuma who could hardly have missed Mulder's point. </p> <p>Some of the forces that coalesced around Zuma largely regarded him as a vehicle to drive Mbeki out. The unions and the Communist party in particular were seeking to pull Zuma to the left of where the outgoing government was. But their support falls behind Motlanthe more naturally as he is a former leader of the National Union of Mineworkers and trade union confederation stalwart. </p> <p>Motlanthe says he has no presidential ambitions but he would be an attractive presidential candidate for the ANC in May if Zuma's legal problems continue. </p> <p>There are already questions over the degree of Zuma's authority as party president. He publicly opposed removing Mbeki from office so either he was duplicitous or was unable to influence other ANC leaders. But if Motlanthe does not shift economic policy to the left, there is a strong possibility the ANC will split.</p> <p>Amid all the praise for Motlanthe, there was little for Mbeki. Tony Leon, foreign affairs spokesman for the opposition Democratic Alliance, compared his downfall to several Shakespearean tragedies. \"His presidency and the forces behind its collapse seem to combine the ambitions of Lady Macbeth, the jealously of Othello, the backstabbing of Iago and, ultimately in its last act, the impotent rage of King Lear,\" he said. But Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe's president, described Mbeki's removal from office as \"devastating\".</p>",
  "<p>As someone who doesn't have the time to watch much television back home in Britain, I have been attempting to profit from my stay in the US, a country where television is, to quote an early 1990s hip-hop lyric, the drug of the nation. As a result, I have a newfound passion for channel surfing. But other than an attack of tendonitis in my thumb and index finger, I have to confess that I have gleaned little else from the experience - save for a sense of disillusionment at the paucity of decent media coverage of the US election.</p> <p>At first sight, there appears to be a smorgasbord of coverage on offer in the US, a profusion of political stances to captivate the attention and acumen of the average viewer. <em>Quot homines, tot sententiae</em>, from NBC to BET, via ABC and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WBLS\">WBLS</a>. Or so I thought. But on closer inspection, it soon becomes evident that what we really have here is limited to a tedious and stifling binary opposition.</p> <p>In the red corner, there is the truly execrable <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/oreilly/index.html\">Bill O'Reilly</a> (who makes Britain's Jeremy Clarkson look like a dulcet cherub) with the eponymous O'Reilly Factor on Fox News - the unofficial Republican party mouthpiece that moonlights as a TV channel. In fact, Fox's reportage was deemed so racist by rap superstar Nas that he denounced and subsequently <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2008/07/23/nas-delivers-petition-to-fox-news-says-network-is-scared/\">delivered a petition</a> to their offices, citing the instances of the onscreen graphic that referred to Michelle Obama as the senator's \"baby mama\", Bill O'Reilly using the phrase \"lynching party\" to refer to attacks on the senator's wife and referring to the couple's famous touching of fists as a \"terrorist fist jab\". </p> <p>And in the blue corner, <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3036677/\">Keith Olbermann</a> is the bruised face of the liberal, left-leaning MSNBC, a channel which unashamedly possesses a clear Obama bias. Add to that the Huffington Post and the Daily Kos blogs respectively as the towel and cut men, and the Democrat corner is complete. And somewhere in the middle of the ring, shuffling laboriously about between the bloodied pugilists, stopping occasionally to check its timepiece, is the ostensibly neutral, bumbling referee, <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/\">CNN</a>.</p> <p>US media coverage of the election seems to work on the principal of Manichean polarity \u2013 which is fitting for such a vehemently religious culture. But who is the St Augustine we need to save us from this dualistic peril? To label the election coverage here as simplistic is to insult simplicity. It is essentially both facile and reductive. Nothing, not even following a cue ball in Harlem, can ever be this black and white. </p> <p>Where, I find myself asking forlornly, is the witty repartee and the ineluctable tension derived from an agonistic bout of cerebral jousting in an interview with the likes of John Humphries on BBC Radio 4's Today program? Where is the delectable schadenfreude to be had from witnessing the sneering, sardonic Jeremy Paxman intellectually mauling an interlocutor on Newsnight? Where is the brio and vim of incisive reportage which injects excitement into even the most mundane and quotidian of British political contests?</p> <p>Instead, here in the US I have been watching coverage which at best can be described as worryingly dichromatic, and at worse meretricious, a coverage which is of course indicative of the shibboleths of American society at large. </p> <p>This, it has to be said, is not a culture which is known for its deft use of nuance, let alone for a concerted and meaningful level of sophistication when it comes to political analysis. It is a culture which, on so many levels, genuflects before the altar of the shallow and the superficial. It is a culture which obsesses over fripperies and fetishises the aesthetic over and above the cerebral. Can you imagine as many column inches being devoted to the size of Gordon Brown's expanding waistline or the way David Cameron cuts his hair as to those expended on whether <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/08/01/wsj-obama-may-be-too-thin_n_116266.html\">Obama is too thin to be president</a> or the significance of <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=5725791\">Sarah Palin's dress sense?</a> (As if any of these factors are in any way indicative of their ability to run the country). Even the recent disingenuous linguistic manipulation which resulted in the \"lipstick on a pig\" controversy highlights where the emphasis of the coverage is being placed.</p> <p>Balance, equality and (most conspicuously) nuance have all been left at the door and refused entry to the party. Instead, strident but essentially vacuous comment and heavily partisan, intellectually vapid reportage lewdly gyrate together in the middle of the dance floor. Over here in the US, style is everything, and substance is nothing. Back home in the UK, we understand the importance of that famous classical adage <em>ars est celare artem</em>. Over here in the US, I am not sure they possess the skill, let alone the skill to hide the skill.</p> <p>The delicate sensibilities of political hermeneutics as evidenced in the UK are all but lost on Americans, where to be honest there is no mass market culture of refined, equitable socio-political exegesis. With their faux tans, well-fitting suits deliberately flattering their rotund girths and de rigeur black- framed glasses which are worn to help cultivate a conscious air of gravitas, political commentators as plasticy as their rictus smiles pour forth verbiage with a disconcerting tedium, imperiously hectoring their audiences one way or the other. If British commentators have been known to write with quills, their American counterparts write with sledgehammers.</p> <p>Come back Auntie BBC \u2013 all is forgiven. Yes, even the risible waste of licence fee payer's money you spend on retaining the services of the remarkably pedestrian Jonathan Ross and the spectacularly odious Jeremy Clarkson! Vive the Beeb, where the closest we get to theatrical affectation invading the reportage is the sight of Andrew Marr raising an eyebrow or the harmless swingometer of Peter Snow.</p> <p>I do wonder what Jeremy Paxman would make of it all? Although clearly guilty of being, in that memorable phrase of Quintillian, \"too much a lover of his own cleverness\", he would at least, one feels, rise to this auspicious occasion. \"Yeeeeeeeeeeeesssssssssss \u2026\"</p> <p>I can hear the trademark sardonic sneer ringing in my ears now. And in the case of this election coverage, it would be wholly deserving.</p>",
  "<p>Look. One of my aims on this blog is hopefully to be a bit amusing sometimes. It's not for me to judge whether it works or not, of course \u2014 that's a different matter. But it sure as hell gets incredibly hard to add anything remotely humorous when the material you're working with is utterly absurd to begin with.

And there in Russia --<br>COURIC: Have you ever been involved with any negotiations for example, with the Russians?<br>PALIN: <strong>We have trade missions back and forth.</strong> We do -- it's very important when you consider even national security issues with Russia -- as Putin rears his head and comes into the airspace of the United States of America, where do they go? It's Alaska. It's right over the border. It is from Alaska that we send those out to make sure an eye is being kept on this very powerful nation, Russia, because they are right there, they are right next to our state.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here's what some other people can think of to say about it:</p> <p><a href=\"http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/09/palin_explains_why_alaska_expe.php\">Greg Sargent:</a> \"Anyone know what this means? Again, that's not snark. Never mind the image of Putin rearing his head as he floats into Alaskan airspace. Is she saying that American spies who keep an eye on Russia take off from Alaska?

  "<p>A $700bn bail-out for Wall Street appeared to have stalled last night after an acrimonious White House summit attended by the two presidential candidates, John McCain and Barack Obama, to resolve the crisis.</p> <p>Wall Street stocks surged as investors anticipated that a deal would ultimately emerge. But after markets closed, George Bush met congressional leaders as well as the two presidential candidates for talks that failed to clinch the deal.</p> <p>Speaking at the start of the summit held to break the congressional deadlock, Bush said: \"We are in a serious economic crisis in the country if we don't pass a piece of legislation ... My hope is that we can reach an agreement very shortly.\"</p> <p>He was reflecting optimism earlier in the day when Democratic and Republican leaders in the Senate and House of Representatives agreed in principle to Bush's bail-out plan.</p> <p>But by the time Bush held his summit hours later much of that goodwill had dissipated. The Democrats blamed the disruption on the intervention of McCain.</p> <p>The Republican candidate wrested the political agenda from Obama on Wednesday by suspending his campaign and saying he would fly to Washington to help end the stalemate. He also called for tonight's presidential debate against Obama in Oxford, Mississippi, to be postponed.</p> <p>Last night, McCain said he was still optimistic that a deal could be concluded in time for him to attend the debate today. Obama too said he thought a deal would still be reached. \"I think eventually we are going to get a deal. There is still work to be done.\" Criticising McCain, he said presidential politics should not be interjected into delicate negotiations. Other Democrats were even more scathing of McCain's manoeuvres. \"What this looked like to me was a rescue plan for John McCain,\" Christopher Dodd told CNN.</p> <p>The need for urgency in tackling the financial crisis was reinforced by more dire news from the US, with unemployment at its highest level for seven years, house sales at their lowest level since 1991 and one of the biggest corporate names in America, General Electric, issuing a profits warning because of \"unprecedented weakness and volatility in the financial services market\". Nonetheless, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped almost 2% to close at 11,022, reflecting expectations of a deal.</p> <p>The deal agreed in principle earlier in the day included restrictions on million-dollar payouts for bankers forced out of their jobs. There is also a mechanism for the government to take an equity stake in some firms, so taxpayers have a chance to profit if the bail-out plan works.</p> <p>With the US turmoil impacting on economies around the world, the prime minister, Gordon Brown, is due to make an unscheduled visit to Washington today to discuss the economy. He is likely to meet Bush for about 40 minutes, and is also expected to use the hastily arranged meeting to discuss the US request for extra British troops in Afghanistan.</p> <p>A White House summit between a president and the two candidates seeking to replace him is rare. Bush was flanked by congressional leaders at the meeting, as well as Obama and McCain, who sat at opposite ends of the cabinet table.</p> <p>Obama and McCain, having flown to Washington from the campaign trail, arrived at the White House at roughly the same time in motorcades, complete with their own press pools.</p>",
  "<p>John McCain today was accused of sabotaging the Wall Street bailout with theatrics that reduced America's credit crisis to a showcase for his presidential leadership capabilities.<br> The furious words for the Republican candidate from Democrats came after a contentious meeting at the White House between George Bush and congressional leaders that was meant to seal a deal on a $700bn economic rescue package.</p> <p>Both McCain and Barack Obama attended the meeting, along with congressional leaders.</p> <p>The extraordinary session had been called in part as a response to McCain's stunning announcement yesterday that he would suspend his presidential campaign and would seek a delay in tomorrow's presidential debate to try to personally help steer through a deal on the bailout.</p> <p>By midday today, congressional leaders said they had reached the outlines of a deal. But that optimism vanished after the White House meeting. </p> <p>Democrats and Republicans said that prospects for a deal vanished after McCain tried to prod his fellow Republicans in another direction. </p> <p>The breakdown cast new uncertainty over Friday night's presidential debate in Mississippi, as well as the future of the bailout itself. </p> <p>McCain said he would not attend the debate until a deal is reached. Obama said he would go to the debate, and the University of Mississippi, which is hosting the event said it planned to go ahead.</p> <p>Tonight, Democrats were scathing of the Republican's posturing, saying he had jeopardised efforts to unite Congress around the plan put forward by the treasury secretary, Henry Paulson. </p> <p>\"This is the presidential campaign of John McCain undermining what Hank Paulson tells us is essential for the country,\" said Barney Frank, the Massachusetts congressman who had been leading negotiations for the Democrats. \"This is McCain at the last minute getting House Republicans to undermine the Paulson approach.\"</p> <p>Obama also chided McCain. \"When you start injecting presidential politics into delicate negotiations you actually start creating more problems,\" he said.</p> <p>The anger and uncertainty about the bailout threatened to rebound against McCain's efforts to cast himself as above the political fray when it came to America's credit crisis. </p> <p>McCain had cast the bailout negotiations as a crisis requiring his personal attention. </p> <p>\"I'm an old Navy pilot, and I know when a crisis calls for all hands on deck,\" he said in a speech to the Clinton Global Initiative in New York before travelling to Washington. \"As of this morning I suspended my campaign. With so much on the line, for America and the world, the debate that matters most right now is taking place in the United States capitol - and I intend to join it.\"</p> <p>Obama continued to reject McCain's argument that the gravity of America's financial crisis should put the election campaign on hold. \"Our election is in 40 days,\" he said in his speech to the Clinton global initiative, delivered from Florida where he was preparing for the debate. </p> <p>\"The American people deserve to hear directly from myself and Senator McCain about how we intend to lead our country. The times are too serious to put our campaign on hold, or to ignore the full range of issues that the next president will face.\"</p> <p>However, it was widely noted that McCain did not even arrive in Washington until after Democratic and Republic leaders announced they had the outlines of a rescue package. <br> McCain admitted as recently as Tuesday that he had not taken the time to even read the bailout plan, according to an NBC interview transcript distributed by the Obama camp.</p> <p>But that did not stop the Republican from seizing the headlines for two days in a row. McCain first wrongfooted Obama yesterday with his stunning anouncement that he would suspend his campaign and would not attend the debate in Mississippi.</p> <p>Today, he struck again, appropriating Obama's conditions for the rescue deal - barely 24 hours after rejecting them.</p> <p>The Democrat had proposed the conditions during discussions with McCain yesterday about a joint statement from the presidential candidates about the financial crisis.</p> <p>In their proposals the Obama camp had called for an independent oversight board, a mechanism to protect taxpayers, a curb on outsized payments to Wall Street executives, and relief for homeowners faced with losing homes. The proposal for a joint statement also rejected attaching other measures, or earmarks, to the bill. </p> <p>In his speech today McCain adopted nearly identical language - as well as the essence of four of the five measures: an oversight board, protection for taxpayers, controls on compensation for Wall Street executives and a ban on earmarks. However, McCain made no mention of relief for homeowners. </p> <p>McCain's newfound sense of urgency for reaching a deal on the rescue package comes after a number of new polls suggesting that the economic crisis was costing the Republican support.</p>",
  "<p>Congressional leaders closed in today on a deal to inject $700bn into the flagging US financial markets after getting a political jolt from the two presidential candidates' arrival in Washington.</p> <p>The outlines of a bail-out agreement emerged hours before a White House meeting that was orchestrated to give John McCain and Barack Obama a chance to weigh in on the nation's economic crisis.</p> <p>The prospect of both candidates appearing during bail-out talks \u2013 an infusion of presidential politics that McCain called for yesterday \u2013 appears to have spurred congressional negotiators toward a quicker-than-anticipated consensus. </p> <p>Chris Dodd, the Democratic chairman of the Senate banking committee, told reporters that a \"fundamental agreement\" had been reached, although he cautioned that specific legislative language was not yet finalised.</p> <p>\"We believe we are prepared to act expeditiously ... and send a message to the markets,\" Dodd said.</p> <p>The markets responded in kind, as Wall Street opened sharply higher than yesterday and by 5pm BST was up more than 2.1%, or 225 points. The FTSE 100 posted a similar pattern, closing 101.5 points higher at 5197, for a rise of 2%.</p> <p>Democrats, following on Obama remarks yesterday, conceded one of their original goals for the bail-out by agreeing not to allow US bankruptcy judges to modify the terms of primary mortgages.</p> <p>The omission of that bankruptcy provision could push liberals to vote against the bail-out when it comes up for a vote, perhaps as soon as tomorrow. </p> <p>Conservatives remain equally reticent, decrying the financial rescue as an abdication of capitalism, but the plan can still pass while losing votes on the left and right.</p> <p>Democratic and Republican leaders are agreed on shepherding the bail-out deal into law, although both sides are eager to twist the outcome as much as possible to help their respective presidential candidates.</p> <p>John Boehner, leading Republican in the House of Representatives, gave McCain credit for jump-starting the process by urging a delay in the presidential debate and asking Obama to return to Washington for a meeting with George Bush.</p> <p>\"John McCain's call to suspend the campaign to come back here \u2026 will, in fact, help speed up the process,\" Boehner told reporters today. \"It clearly lays more urgency on the Congress to act.\"</p> <p>Senior Democrats such as Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, were equally adamant that McCain's leap into the bail-out fray had hurt their efforts to reach consensus.</p> <p>\"If we lose progress on this because of one person, that's John McCain,\" Reid told reporters today. \"He's standing in the way.\"</p> <p>The emergence of a pact, even if only in principle, clears the way for McCain and Obama to claim the mantle of leadership at their White House meeting, scheduled for 9pm BST. </p> <p>But if Congress is already beginning to debate a bail-out agreement by tomorrow, the path is also cleared for the debate to continue as planned, in an undeniable setback for McCain.</p>",

  "<p>While the west has at times been divided in its evaluation of the threat posed by Iran's nuclear programme, in Israel the feeling is unambiguous.</p> <p>Israelis believe the threat is best exemplified by Iran's hardline president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who has repeatedly expressed his contempt for their country since taking office in 2005.</p> <p>Ahmadinejad has described the Holocaust as a myth and most famously, in 2006, was reported as saying he wanted to see Israel \"wiped off the map\". There were claims that the quote was inaccurate but either way he has shown little love towards Israel and has used threats towards the country to try to boost his popularity among Muslims angry at perceived injustices inflicted on the Palestinians.</p> <p>Only yesterday, in New York for the UN general assembly, Ahmadinejad claimed that \"a small but deceitful minority of Zionists are playing with the American public\", comments aimed at the forthcoming US election. </p> <p>Israel's geographical proximity to Iran and the fact that it is so resented by the Muslim world \u2013 who Ahmadinejad still looks to for support despite most leaders' dislike of him - coupled with the military might of the US make Israel a much more likely target than America. And for the Israelis, the idea of Ahmadinejad with his finger on a nuclear button is unthinkable.</p> <p>After a US intelligence report published at the end of 2007 said Tehran's nuclear weapons programme had been on hold since 2003, Israel's prime minister, Ehud Olmert, was quick to indicate that he did not agree, saying that \"all options are on the table\". Israel is said to believe that Iran could possess a nuclear bomb as soon as 2010. </p> <p>Israeli officials were reportedly unhappy when the US announced plans to station diplomats in Iran for the first time since 1979, fearing a softening of Washington's stance towards Tehran.<br> And when Olmert announced a series of initiatives designed at ending long-running conflicts with Lebanon, Syria and Hamas earlier this year, Iran was conspicuous by its absence. What is more, the talks with Syria were seen as a deliberate attempt to isolate Iran from the one Middle East country it could truly call an ally. </p> <p>The world may have shuddered when Israel's deputy prime minister, Shaul Mofaz, said in June that a strike on Iran's nuclear sites would be \"unavoidable\" if Tehran refused to halt its alleged weapons programmes, but within Israel the reaction was more muted. Mofaz himself was unrepentant, even going so far as to repeat the threat.</p> <p>While Olmert publicly disassociated himself from the comments \u2013 Israel's relationship with the US dictated that nothing less would be acceptable - he later assured the Israeli public: \"Iran will not be nuclear.\"</p> <p>Olmert's successor, Tzipi Livni, has also talked tough on Iran but the scale of her rhetoric has not touched that of Mofaz. The Israeli public's concerns were perhaps reflected by the fact that Mofaz \u2013 who had been viewed as an outsider \u2013 in the end only lost the election to be Kadima's new leader to Livni by a whisker.</p>",
  "<p>Israel gave serious thought this spring to launching a military strike on Iran's nuclear sites but was told by President George W Bush that he would not support it and did not expect to revise that view for the rest of his presidency, senior European diplomatic sources have told the Guardian. </p> <p>The then prime minister, Ehud Olmert, used the occasion of Bush's trip to Israel for the 60th anniversary of the state's founding to raise the issue in a one-on-one meeting on May 14, the sources said. \"He took it [the refusal of a US green light] as where they were at the moment, and that the US position was unlikely to change as long as Bush was in office\", they added.</p> <p> The sources work for a European head of government who met the Israeli leader some time after the Bush visit. Their talks were so sensitive that no note-takers attended, but the European leader subsequently divulged to his officials the highly sensitive contents of what Olmert had told him of Bush's position.</p> <p> Bush's decision to refuse to offer any support for a strike on Iran appeared to be based on two factors, the sources said. One was US concern over Iran's likely retaliation, which would probably include a wave of attacks on US military and other personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as on shipping in the Persian Gulf. </p> <p>The other was US anxiety that Israel would not succeed in disabling Iran's nuclear facilities in a single assault even with the use of dozens of aircraft. It could not mount a series of attacks over several days without risking full-scale war. So the benefits would not outweigh the costs. </p> <p>Iran has repeatedly said it would react with force to any attack. Some western government analysts believe this could include asking Lebanon's Shia movement Hizbollah to strike at the US. </p> <p>\"It's over ten years since Hizbollah's last terror strike outside Israel, when it hit an Argentine-Israel association building in Buenos Aires [killing 85 people]\", said one official. \"There is a large Lebanese diaspora in Canada which must include some Hizbollah supporters. They could slip into the United States and take action\". </p> <p>Even if Israel were to launch an attack on Iran without US approval its planes could not reach their targets without the US becoming aware of their flightpath and having time to ask them to abandon their mission. </p> <p>\"The shortest route to Natanz lies across Iraq and the US has total control of Iraqi airspace\", the official said. Natanz, about 100 miles north of Isfahan, is the site of an uranium enrichment plant. </p> <p>In this context Iran would be bound to assume Bush had approved it, even if the White House denied fore-knowledge, raising the prospect of an attack against the US. <br> Several high-level Israeli officials have hinted over the last two years that Israel might strike Iran's nuclear facilities to prevent them being developed to provide sufficient weapons-grade uranium to make a nuclear bomb. Iran has always denied having such plans. </p> <p>Olmert himself raised the possibility of an attack at a press conference during a visit to London last November, when he said sanctions were not enough to block Iran's nuclear programme. </p> <p>\"Economic sanctions are effective. They have an important impact already, but they are not sufficient. So there should be more. Up to where? Up until Iran will stop its nuclear programme,\" he said.</p> <p>The revelation that Olmert was not merely sabre-rattling to try to frighten Iran but considered the option seriously enough to discuss it with Bush shows how concerned Israeli officials had become. </p> <p>Bush's refusal to support an attack, and the strong suggestion he would not change his mind, is likely to end speculation that Washington might be preparing an \"October surprise\" before the US presidential election. Some analysts have argued that Bush would back an Israeli attack in an effort to help John McCain's campaign by creating an eve-of-poll security crisis. </p> <p>Others have said that in the case of an Obama victory, the vice-president, Dick Cheney, the main White House hawk, would want to cripple Iran's nuclear programme in the dying weeks of Bush's term.</p> <p>During Saddam Hussein's rule in 1981, Israeli aircraft successfully destroyed Iraq's nuclear reactor at Osirak shortly before it was due to start operating. </p> <p>Last September they knocked out a buildings complex in northern Syria, which US officials later said had been a partly constructed nuclear reactor based on a North Korean design. Syria said the building was a military complex but had no links to a nuclear programme. </p> <p>In contrast, Iran's nuclear facilities, which are officially described as intended only for civilian purposes, are dispersed around the country and some are in fortified bunkers underground.</p> <p>In public, Bush gave no hint of his view that the military option had to be excluded. In a speech to the Knesset the following day he confined himself to telling Israel's parliament: \"America stands with you in firmly opposing Iran's nuclear weapons ambitions. Permitting the world's leading sponsor of terror to possess the world's deadliest weapon would be an unforgivable betrayal of future generations. For the sake of peace, the world must not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon.''</p> <p>Mark Regev, Olmert's spokesman, tonight reacted to the Guardian's story saying: \"The need to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons is raised at every meeting between the prime minister and foreign leaders. Israel prefers a diplomatic solution to this issue but all options must remain on the table. Your unnamed European source attributed words to the prime minister that were not spoken in any working meeting with foreign guests\". </p> <p>Three weeks after Bush's red light, on June 2, Israel mounted a massive air exercise covering several hundred miles in the eastern Mediterranean. It involved dozens of warplanes, including F-15s, F-16s and aerial refueling tankers. </p> <p>The size and scope of the exercise ensured that the US and other nations in the region saw it, said a US official, who estimated the distance was about the same as from Israel to Natanz. </p> <p>A few days later, Israel's deputy prime minister, Shaul Mofaz, told the paper Yediot Ahronot: \"If Iran continues its programme to develop nuclear weapons, we will attack it. The window of opportunity has closed. The sanctions are not effective. There will be no alternative but to attack Iran in order to stop the Iranian nuclear programme.\" </p> <p>The exercise and Mofaz's comments may have been designed to boost the Israeli government and military's own morale as well, perhaps, to persuade Bush to reconsider his veto. Last week Mofaz narrowly lost a primary within the ruling Kadima party to become Israel's next prime minister. Tzipi Livni, who won the contest, takes a less hawkish position. </p> <p>The US announced two weeks ago that it would sell Israel 1,000 bunker-busting bombs. The move was interpreted by some analysts as a consolation prize for Israel after Bush told Olmert of his opposition to an attack on Iran. But it could also enhance Israel's attack options in case the next US president revives the military option. </p> <p>The guided bomb unit-39 (GBU-39) has a penetration capacity equivalent to a one-tonne bomb. Israel already has some bunker-busters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337989061\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2008/09/25/26.09.08.Iran.nuclear.gif\" alt=\"Iran nuclear map\" width=\"468\" height=\"340\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Map showing nuclear activity in Iran</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>",
  "<p>The White House election could be decided in just 90 minutes. The presidential debate, still scheduled for tomorrow night in Oxford, Mississippi, provides the first opportunity for voters to see John McCain and Barack Obama together and finally make up their minds.</p> <p>Almost 20% of the electorate are still undecided, according to the polls, and both Democratic and Republican pollsters agree that the debate, set to attract a record television audience, could settle lingering doubts about the two candidates.</p> <p>The pollsters, in a rare show of consensus, agree that the main question Obama has to deal with is over whether, given his lack of experience, he is credible as commander in chief. The main question about McCain is whether he represents a continuation of President George Bush's administration, fatal for his hopes of taking the White House.</p> <p>What gives the debate an extra edge is that neither Obama nor McCain, though good communicators, are good debaters. The debate has been further complicated by the political manoeuvring of McCain over the last 48 hours that has given the Republican candidate an extra edge.</p> <p>Professor Alan Schroeder, author of Presidential Debates: Fifty Years of High-Risk TV, looking back at previous debates, said: \"We never know what is going to happen in live TV events. The outcome is often different from what we anticipated.\"</p> <p>Schroeder, who is based at Boston's North-Eastern University, added that the debate offered a rare opportunity to see the candidates when they are not sticking carefully to prepared speeches. \"We get a little more sense of the individual and how he behaves under pressure,\" he said.</p> <p>Is Obama credible as commander in chief? The topic for the first debate was switched, as a result of lobbying from Obama, from domestic policy to foreign affairs, mainly because Obama's campaign team is well aware that the biggest question is the commander in chief one and that most floating voters make up their mind in the first of the three debates.</p> <p>Obama had been preparing hard for this, having planned to spend almost four days holed up in his 'debate camp' in Tampa. The Democratic candidate was refining his arguments on Iraq, Iran and a host of other foreign policy issues.</p> <p>But the debate, in spite of the topic, is also going to be about the economy and McCain will go to the heart of electors doubts about Obama by claiming that this week he, rather than the Democratic candidate, demonstrated leadership on the issue.</p> <p>Daniel Schnur, who was McCain's communications director during the 2000 campaign for the Republican presidential nomination against George Bush, sees the debate as more important for Obama than McCain. \"To a large degree, this first debate is about Obama. Voters are intrigued. They are not sure he can handle the challenges. In 90 minutes, he will have the chance to reassure voters that he is comfortable and capable with these issues. I think the first debate will be decisive. It will set the tone from which most voters will make their assessment.\"</p> <p>Schnur said that McCain can not allow Obama to glide through the debate. He compared the debate to the 1980 one when Ronald Reagan, like Obama, had to persuade voters he was up to the job. \"Reagan did not dazzle or dominate but he reassured voters he could handle high office. It is not a high bar for Obama unless McCain can throw him off his game,\" Schnur said. And McCain seems to be doing that.</p> <p>Can McCain convince voters he will not be a continuation of Bush? Schroeder said Bush would be \"lurking as a backdrop to this debate\". While McCain would distance himself as much as possible from the president, he expected Obama to raise him as often as he could.</p> <p>McCain is one of the few Republicans who can argue with some conviction, given his history as a party dissident, that he offers different policies from those pursued by Bush over the last eight years.</p> <p>Although it is a hard sell, given public antipathy towards Bush and the Republican party, McCain is presenting himself as a vehicle for change and reform. Republican-leaning analysts argue that making Sarah Palin his vice presidential candidate helped in terms of making him look plausible as an agent for change.</p> <p>On the downside for McCain is the image the two men will present on stage. He is 72 and looks it, in stark contrast with Obama, aged 47. Schroeder said: \"McCain looks like man whose time has come and gone. Obama has the advantage of youth. It may not be articulated in the debate but will be lurking there.\"</p> <p>Stan Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, and Neil Newhouse, a Republican pollster, gave a rare joint briefing with journalists in Washington last week.

  "<p>Yes! I've waited a long time for this, but at last, at long, long last, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/25/anglicanism.catholicism1\">I can be Queen</a>! I shall be beautiful and terrible as the dawn! All shall love me, and despair! </p> <p>For most of my life the only upside to being Catholic (albeit phenomenally lapsed) was the certainty that I wouldn't burn in hell like some ghastly Protestant. Well, that and being allowed to drink wine from the age of seven. </p> <p>But now, now I have the chance, however faint, of joining the royal succession, with all its benefits like \u2026 like \u2026 well ... um \u2026 wearing a shiny hat and having two birthdays \u2026 oh, and I'd get my own telly show. Only once a year, initially, but you've got to start somewhere, and a Christmas special would do. I'd probably make it more fun than just a boring old speech though. More like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-zxi_Y4Xu8\">Hole in the Wall</a>. I could call it \"The One Show\".</p> <p>Other things one will do when one is Queen will include eating a swan, meeting Helen Mirren and playing practical jokes on royal correspondent and certified pompous oaf James Whitaker. It's going to be brilliant.</p> <p>The downside of course will be hanging out at Boujis, dealing with an even weirder family than I do already, and having to take my own loo seat everywhere (according to my friend Sue whose Dad used to be Dean of Christchurch, Oxford so definitely knows definitely). But I'd cope. It would be my royal duty.</p> <p>That still leaves some things that as, technically, a Catholic, I can't be. A mason, for example, or free of the nagging sense that I'm disappointing someone. But it's a step forward nevertheless.</p> <p>What is this terror of Papism? JFK had to deal with anti-Catholic prejudice in the 1960 election, which I think mostly consisted of Richard Nixon saying, \"He's a Catholic, ya know\", and then making spooky noises during the debates. But then, white, posh, handsome, Harvard-educated man Kennedy triumphed over such discrimination to win. You've got to love an underdog.</p> <p>I suppose the worry is that if the monarch was Catholic, they'd take advice from the Pope, and we couldn't have a German running the country, could we? Oh no, hang on \u2026</p> <p>The argument for abolishing these bits of the Act of Settlement is of course that discriminating on the grounds of religion and gender is not very 21st century. Which is true, but with the whole <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/25/monarchy.constitution1\">choosing-your-head-of-state-based-on-whose-womb-they-happen-to-come-out-of</a> still in place, I can't help feeling it may be missing the bigger picture. </p> <p>And on the other hand, I find it slightly worrying news. For two principal reasons. 1. Tony Blair and 2. Cherie Blair. Tony's probably fancying his chances of weasling in to Windsor Castle now that he's weasled his way into the Roman Church. I don't want to undermine his commitment to the church, but most Catholics feel guilty without any reason to, and he's very much bucking that trend. If I were Gordon Brown, and I wouldn't be, I'd scupper the legislation for that reason alone. Just listen to William Hague's brilliant <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1w1Gu015R0\">description</a> of Blair becoming EU president and think how much worse it would be if Brown had to call him \"your majesty\".</p> <p>Puts a new spin on Ruth Kelly's resignation, doesn't it? And with that desperately creepy thought, I'm off to get myself to get myself a corgi.</p>",

Obama is up two points:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>The latest Rasmussen Reports telephone survey in the Tar Heel State shows Obama attracting 49% of the vote while McCain earns 47%. A week ago, McCain held a three-point edge. This is the first time in eight Rasmussen Reports polls that Obama has held any kind of a lead in North Carolina, though the candidates were tied once as well...</p> <p>...As always, the racial divide is sharp. In the Tar Heel State, Obama is supported by 98% of African-Americans while McCain currently earns the vote from 64% of White voters.</p> </blockquote> <p>So, 36% white support for Obama is high in a conservative southern state like that (whereas it would be terrible in, say, Minnesota).

  "<p>Democrats heaped scorn on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/24/uselections2008.johnmccain3\">John McCain's shock decision</a> on Wednesday to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/sep/24/johnmccain.uselections20083\">suspend his presidential campaign</a> and return to Washington to tackle the nation's financial crisis. The Republican nominee's move was dismissed as a \"stunt\", an act of desperation by a flailing candidate heading for inevitable defeat in November.</p> <p>But as with the equally unexpected selection of Alaskan \"hockey mom\" Sarah Palin as Republican vice-presidential candidate, the Democrats' denunciations betray a sense of unease, if not panicky fear. By jumping feet-first into the middle of Congressional negotiations on George Bush's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/25/wallstreet.useconomy\">$700bn Wall Street bailout plan</a>, McCain, who counts impetuosity as a virtue, had pulled another fast one. Once again, his opponents didn't see it coming.</p> <p>Whatever the longer-term verdict may be, for the moment at least the Democrats are suddenly on the back foot. Just when Barack Obama appeared to be establishing a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/sep/24/uselections2008.barackobama?DCMP=EMC-E_EMS_USE_REG_08_09_25\">clear national poll</a> lead based on greater public confidence in his ability to manage the economy, McCain, the former fighter pilot, dive-bombed out of nowhere and blew the ground from under him.</p> <p>It was nothing less than an audacious bid to claim the mantle of national saviour for himself. The maverick rides again.</p> <p>In public statements McCain suggested his decision was a statesman-like one, prompted by discussions with Republican congressional leaders on Wednesday morning during which they told him the bailout plan lacked sufficient support. As the Republicans tell it, by calling a halt to campaigning and seeking a postponement of tomorrow's presidential debate, McCain acted selflessly in the national interest.</p> <p>They plainly hope McCain's bombshell will underscore his principal appeal to voters as an experienced, seasoned leader who, rising above the fray, can make Washington work.</p> <p>\"This is the greatest single act of responsibility ever taken by a presidential candidate,\" said former Republican House speaker, <a href=\"http://newt.org/tabid/193/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/3739/The-McCain-Leadership-Factor.aspx\">Newt Gingrich</a>, standard-bearer of another, mostly forgotten 1990s \"revolution\" to change the way Washington works. \"This is the day the McCain-reform Republican party began to truly emerge as a movement which puts the country first, solutions first, and big change first.\" The conservative Washington Times commented: \"Democrats had dared McCain to show leadership and he stepped up.\"</p> <p>Veteran Republican strategist Ed Rollins was more circumspect. He said only the people's verdict on November 4 would reveal whether McCain's gamble had paid off. The respected political columnist <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/24/AR2008092403008_pf.html\">David Broder suggested</a> meanwhile that a failure to take primary responsibility for the allegedly necessary but deeply unpopular Wall Street bailout by both Bush and the Democratic leadership in Congress had given McCain an opening.</p> <p>\"In the greatest crisis to confront the American economic system in three-quarters of a century, it is notable that the leaders of the two elected branches of the federal government have not been calling the signals. George Bush, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid (the Democratic leaders of the House and Senate respectively) have stepped back to permit deputies ... to take the lead in figuring out a solution,\" Broder wrote in the Washington Post.</p> <p>The risks for McCain are considerable. Any bailout package, even if it contains provisions preventing benefits accruing to the fabled greedy \"fat cats\" of the banking world, will have dubious appeal to an economically strapped electorate. The public's ambivalence, bordering on outright hostility, was partly why Bush used such draconian language in his national television address on Wednesday night.</p> <p>Bush's warnings about the possible \"devastation\" of the \"overall economy\", not just the banking sector, and of a \"long and painful recession\" was a vintage exposition of the politics of fear, in which he has few equals. But voters don't like being scared and bullied, and they don't like this president, and on this issue as with others, McCain may be tarred with Bush's clumsy brush.</p> <p>But Obama is in unexpected difficulty, too, following his opponent's demarche. For a moment or two on Wednesday, he was left sitting at his \"debate camp\" headquarters in Florida, looking hesitant, sidelined, and off-the-pace. Bush's subsequent invitation to him to join today's White House bailout summit forced him to reverse his earlier refusal to follow McCain back to Washington.</p> <p>Obama's continuing insistence that Friday's debate on foreign policy should go ahead on time looks problematic, too. He is doubtless right to say such weighty issues need discussing in a public forum. But borrowing, not Baghdad, is the focus for most Americans right now. Iran's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/sep/23/mahmoud.ahmadinejad.united.nations\">Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a> may be scary. But far scarier is the fact that General Motors has run out of credit and 592,000 jobs were lost in August alone.</p> <p>In making his dramatic move, McCain has once again disrupted the national election narrative so carefully nurtured by the Democrats since Obama's Iowa caucus victory. He did it at an earlier stage in the campaign, by shamelessly appropriating Obama's theme of change and reform. He did it again by picking Palin as his running mate, a choice both preposterous and potent. Now he has dared to put himself forward as Americans' economic champion. If the bailout is agreed and seen to work - a big \"if\" - McCain will claim the credit and possibly the election.</p> <p>It quite takes one's breath away. But then, so does this whole extraordinary campaign.</p>",
  "<p>Colorado Democrats accused a Republican county clerk yesterday of falsely informing Colorado College that students from outside the state could not register to vote if their parents claimed them as a dependent on their tax returns.</p> <p>At a news conference in Colorado Springs, Democrats also criticized Robert Balink, the El Paso County clerk and recorder, who was a delegate to the Republican National Convention, for taking other steps they said would dampen voting by college students, who are expected to heavily favor Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama.</p> <p>\"When election officials spread false information about who is eligible to vote and remove, not add, polling places, we need to be concerned that eligible voters will be denied their right to vote,\" said Pat Waak, the chairwoman of the Colorado Democratic Party.</p> <p>Balink issued a statement saying his office had misinterpreted state law and \"mistakenly published information that was incorrect\".</p> <p>Balink's actions are the latest of several instances in which local election officials, including some in Virginia and South Carolina, have discouraged college students from voting in a year in which legions of students have thrown their energy behind Obama.</p> <p>Discovery of these restrictions comes as Democrats have increasingly accused Republicans of using an array of tactics to suppress the Democratic voter turnout in the November election.</p> <p>Liz Olson, the elections manager in Colorado's El Paso County, said that the office \"takes full responsibility for what's in that document. Nobody told us to put anything in there\".</p> <p>Martha Tierney, an attorney for the Colorado Democratic Party, said she obtained emails showing that Balink's office sent a misleading flier to the Colorado College president's office to provide students with voter-registration information and urged its circulation on campus.</p> <p>The flier stated: \"What this means is that if your parents still claim you on their income tax returns, and they file that return in a state other than Colorado, you are not eligible to register to vote or vote in Colorado.\"</p> <p>Voter residency requirements vary from state to state, but must meet the guarantees of the US Constitution, said Jon Greenbaum, a voting rights expert with the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. Greenbaum said that what states and counties can't do is adopt rules that treat one group of voters differently than others.</p> <p>Greenbaum noted that Virginia's elections board recently revised language on its website that discouraged students from registering after reports of a similar episode at Virginia Tech, in Blacksburg, Virginia. The New York Times reported on September 8 that a local registrar had issued two releases that incorrectly suggested dire consequences for the university's students who registered to vote there, including the possibility they no longer could be claimed as dependents on their parents' tax returns.</p> <p>Sujatha Jahagirdar, the program director of the Student Public Interest Research Group's New Voters Project in Washington, said she encountered similar problems when she posed as a college freshman last week and called registrar's offices in Greenville County, South Carolina, home to Furman University, and York County, South Carolina, where Winthrop University is located.</p> <p>Jahagirdar said a Greenville official asked if her parents listed her as a dependent, and when she replied in the affirmative, told her: \"You should vote where your parents live.\" She said a York County representative asked if she was in town for school, and when she said yes, stated flatly: \"You can't vote here.\"</p> <p>A caller yesterday got similar responses.</p> <p>Told of the information imparted by his staff, Conway Belangia, Greenville County's director of registration and elections, said that \"if a staff person made a statement like that, it was an error\".</p> <p>A York County official didn't respond to calls for comment.<br>Belangia said, however, that if a student lives in a dormitory, he must respond to a series of questions laid out in a 1974 federal court order covering voting registration in the county. He said students must demonstrate their \"intent to claim this locale as their home when they finish school\".</p> <p>Jahagirdar called the counties' policies \"intimidating\" and said they \"send a message that young voters are not welcome in our democracy\" just when they're first enjoying the right to vote.</p> <p>The flap over students' voting rights comes after Democrats last week filed a lawsuit in Michigan, seeking a court order barring Republicans from using lists of people facing mortgage foreclosure proceedings as a basis for challenging their voting eligibility. Michigan Republicans denied using foreclosure lists to cast doubt about voters' qualifications.</p> <p>And in Ohio, a pivotal state that was mired in allegations of voting irregularities in the 2004 presidential election, secretary of state Jennifer Brunner yesterday advised county election boards that foreclosure lists should not be considered proof that voters have changed residences.</p> <p>\"Ohioans faced with the pain and turmoil of a home foreclosure should not be targeted by the forces of disenfranchisement on election day,\" Brunner said.</p>",

He took 269 votes against 50 for a candidate standing for the opposition Democratic Alliance.</p> <p>Mbeki resigned as the head of state on Sunday on the orders of the ANC leadership following a long and bitter power struggle with his former deputy, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/dec/19/southafrica.international1\">Jacob Zuma</a>.</p> <p>His toppling plunged South Africa into its deepest political crisis since the end of apartheid. </p> <p>Almost one-third of the country's cabinet members resigned in a show of loyalty to Mbeki, although some - including the finance minister, Trevor Manuel - said they would serve under Motlanthe if asked.</p> <p>Motlanthe, a former trade unionist and freedom fighter, is expected to act as a caretaker leader until elections are held next year, when Zuma is likely to become president.</p> <p>Mbeki's presidency was fatally weakened after the high court threw out a long-standing corruption case against Zuma and accused the president of misusing the judicial system to keep his rival from power.</p> <p>Political divisions within the ANC have continued to deepen following Mbeki's resignation, and speculation has mounted that it may not survive as a single party.</p> <p>Motlanthe, who was jailed for 10 years by the apartheid regime, played a key role in ousting Mbeki and installing Zuma as the ANC leader last year. </p> <p>He has broad support across the party, and it is hoped he may be able to heal the rifts within it.</p> <p>Baleka Mbete, South Africa's parliamentary speaker, is expected to be appointed as the new deputy president.</p> <p>Yesterday, Robert Mugabe, the president of neighbouring Zimbabwe, described Mbeki's resignation as \"devastating\". </p> <p>Mbeki was frequently criticised for taking a soft line with Mugabe, but he managed to broker a power-sharing deal to end the Zimbabwean leader's authoritarian grip on power earlier this month.</p> <p>\"It's devastating news that ...

  "<p>A thought: As I've written, I have believed (as others have) that McCain desperately wanted to vote against the bailout if he could get away with it. The politics of a \"no\" vote were perfect for him -- he could keep being a populist demagogue, he could go against Bush, he could explain how he admires the president and Hank Paulson but he puts country ahead of party etc. It was cynical but it was a winner.</p> <p>But now that McCain has selflessly dedicated himself to rescuing the country from financial ruin and will visit the president with Obama, can he back out after that and vote no? I guess anything is possible. That seems like a move that might be pretty hard to pull off.</p> <p>So he's stuck looking all...responsible. He must hate that!<br></p>",
  "<p>Yesterday, I wrote <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/sep/24/johnmccain.wallstreet\">a long post</a> comparing the McCain camp's response to the NYTimes Rick Davis story to assertions in the story itself. Click on the above link and it'll take you through to both original documents.</p> <p>I noted that there seemed to be one actual factual discrepancy. The Times story said that Davis retained some kind of equity stake in the lobbying firm. The McCain statement said he had received zero-zip-nada since his \"financial separation\" from the firm in 2006.</p> <p>Only one of those could be accurate. Which one?</p> <p>Sit down. Brace yourself. I know you'll find this shocking. But apparently the McCain statement was misleading. Michael Isikoff reported <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/id/160713/output/printhttp://www.newsweek.com/id/160713/output/print\">this </a>for Newsweek:</p> <blockquote> <p>Rick Davis, John McCain's campaign manager, has remained the treasurer<br>and a corporate director of his lobbying firm this year, despite<br>repeated statements by campaign officials that he had ended his<br>relationship with the firm in 2006, according to corporate records...</p> <p>...In its initial statements to reporters this week, the McCain campaign<br>said that the disclosure of the payments from Freddie Mac was irrelevant<br>because Davis, who was never a registered lobbyist for the troubled<br>housing corporation, had severed his relationship with Davis Manafort in<br>2006, and was no longer drawing any income from it...</p> <p>...But those statements appear to have overstated the extent to which Davis<br>had severed his relationship with his lobbying firm. Filings made by<br>\"Davis Manafort Partners\" with the Virginia Corporation Commission as<br>recently as April 1, 2008, show that Davis was still listed as one of<br>only two corporate officers and directors of the firm, according to<br>records on the commission's Web site reviewed by NEWSWEEK. That filing<br>records Davis as the \"treas/clerk\" of the firm; his business partner,<br>Paul Manafort is listed as the president and chief executive officer.<br>Another filing by \"Davis Manafort, Inc.\" (with the same Alexandria, Va.<br>address, and recorded on Oct. 17, 2007) also lists Davis as an officer<br>and director of the firm, reporting his position as \"T/Clerk,\" a<br>reference to his formal title as corporate treasurer and clerk.</p> </blockquote> <p>Let's see. If my math is correct, \"2007\" and \"2008\" come after \"2006.\" Another lie. I hope you're not too disillusioned.<br></p>",
  "<p>The government's plans to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/25/anglicanism.catholicism1\">update the monarchy</a> are welcome so far as they go, but they do not go very far. Removing the sex and religious discrimination embedded in the British constitution \u2013 the 1701 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/25/anglicanism.catholicism2\">Act of Settlement</a> \u2013 is long overdue. But the anomaly remains: why should an important public office, that of head of state, be filled, not on merit or by public election, but exclusively by the descendants of a 17th-century German princess?</p> <p>Under the British constitution, it is the Act of Settlement which determines upon whom the crown shall descend. It reads today as a blood curdling anti-catholic diatribe, providing that any monarch who holds communion with the Church of Rome or marries a papist shall be unthroned immediately. It creates for the UK a white Anglo-German protestant head of state \u2013 descending from the body of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_of_Hanover\">Princess Sophia of Hanover</a> according to the feudal principle of primogeniture, which requires inheritance down the male line. This is in blatant contravention of the Sex Discrimination Act whilst the requirement that the monarch be an Anglican amounts to discrimination on grounds of religion and is contrary to the Human Rights Act. Why would Charles be unfit to be king if he became a Methodist, or a Hindu or Muslim or Rastarfarian? It is wholly unacceptable to have this primitive bigotry embodied in the rules for choosing a head of state. The laws which define and protect the royal family breach at least four articles of the European convention on human rights. They are obsolete and obnoxious. </p> <p>There are many other laws relating to the royal family, most of which are merely silly (although the monarch's immunity from any legal action may not be amusing if you are run over by a royal motorcade): I do not really object to the law which vests property in every wild white swan in the realm in the Queen, nor to the fact that every whale, sturgeon or grampus landed in the kingdom belongs to her. Actually, the law states that the heads of what it terms \"the royal fish\" should belong to the King and their tails to the Queen. On vital matters like these, our constitution is very explicit.</p> <p>It is much less clear about trifling details such as which party gets to form the government in a hung parliament. But there you go. If you don't write down your rules, they will be invented or manipulated by those in power at the time. We have an Alice-in-Wonderland constitution which means what the prime minister wants it to mean.</p> <p>Instead of a written constitution, we have a patchwork quilt of ancient and outdated laws, supplemented by the conventions and traditions made up as we merrily and royally roll along. As a result we have no independent head of state. The monarch now accepts the advice \u2013 that's a euphemism for obeying the directions \u2013 of the government of the day. We lack an elected and respected figurehead, whose wisdom and integrity can provide moral leadership and independent political judgment in times of crisis. One inevitable result of choosing a head of state by inheritance rather than election is that in a crisis they may lack the confidence, popularity and independence needed to make any worthwhile contribution to the governance of Britain.</p> <p>That is a pity, if only because the concept of an independent elected head of state is useful in a modern constitution, as one check on the power of a government which has no other checks and balances, other than a judiciary to keep it straight at the edges and a press to yap at its more obvious blunders. It has no supreme court to pull it up short for violating the guarantees made to its citizens by a bill of rights.</p> <p>The head of state should be someone who embodies the outlook that most people want to see projected onto the world stage as representative of their nation: a figure available to serve as leader in cases of government crisis or collapse. Good luck apart, the British monarchy will not provide \u2013 by sexist, racist or religiously discriminatory descent \u2013 the calibre of leadership that can be provided by elections every seven years for head of state.</p> <p>The head of state is an important public office. Its occupant must be consulted by the prime minister and is required to advise and to warn the government of the day. In an emergency, the head of state's political savvy and street wisdom might prove crucial: in <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article653956.ece\">Trinidad in 1990</a>, for example, the president had to run the country for a week and deal with a crisis when the prime minister and cabinet were held as hostages in parliament by Islamic terrorists. Australians will never forget the historic misjudgement of their governor-general (and de facto head of state) in 1975, when in the name of the Queen he sacked the <a href=\"http://whitlamdismissal.com/\">Whitlam government</a>. What would the Queen do in such circumstances in Britain, or if an election resulted in a deadlock? It is demeaning to democracy to have this office filled by descent from one massively wealthy upper class family, and not by merit (eg a head of state elected by parliament) or preferably, elected by the people. It is also dangerous: no one could seriously expect the Queen herself to handle the sort of emergency that occurred in Trinidad.</p> <p>Tom Paine pointed out that a hereditary head of state was as ridiculous as a hereditary poet or a hereditary mathematician. He overlooked the entertainment potential in a hereditary royal family \u2013 one reason why every tabloid will fight to preserve ours. No government could envisage their abolition, at least in the Queen's lifetime, although the constitution could be rewritten to give the monarchy only a very small part of it. They could run castles, hold royal garden parties at Buckingham Palace, take overseas trips to maintain Commonwealth ties, and boost the trade in whisky, jam and boot polish that comes \"by royal appointment.\" The monarchy could, in other words, be stripped of its political status whilst retaining its symbolic position. The head of state would be a president, elected every seven years to advise the government, inspire the people and open (and if necessarily close) the parliament.</p> <p>If the monarchy is to have a fighting chance of playing a useful part in the governments of 21st century Britain, it will permit itself to be stripped of the Act of Settlement's sex and religious discrimination, and accept a secular and minimal role as custodians of its own history, a role which should be clearly defined in a written constitution.</p>",
  "<p>The blogger Anonymous Liberal hits on another reason that may help explain why McCain pulled his stunt yesterday: the disastrous day Sarah Palin had, particularly her interview with Katie Couric.</p> <p>The crucial exchange was this:</p> <blockquote> <p>COURIC: But he's been in Congress for 26 years. He's been chairman of the powerful Commerce Committee. And he has almost always sided with less regulation, not more.</p> <p>PALIN: He's also known as the maverick, though. Taking shots from his own party, and certainly taking shots from the other party. Trying to get people to understand what he's been talking about \u2014 the need to reform government.</p> <p>COURIC: I'm just going to ask you one more time, not to belabor the point. Specific examples in his 26 years of pushing for more regulation?</p> <p>PALIN: I'll try to find you some, and I'll bring them to you.</p> </blockquote> <p>It was preposterous. And it wasn't the only preposterous thing about Palin's day yesterday. Before the Couric taping, as she was meeting world leaders, someone from the press <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/jonathanmartin/0908/Palin_gets_question_looks_to_McCain_demurs.html?showall\">actually shouted a question</a> (the nerve!) and Palin looked over at McCain, who shook his head no (presumably meaning no, don't answer). </p> <p>Now back to Anonymous Liberal. <a href=\"http://www.anonymousliberal.com/2008/09/was-mccains-stunt-attempt-at-palin.html\">This is insightful</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>While there's certainly a lot going on right now, I'm pretty confident that if McCain hadn't engaged in his late afternoon theatrics, those two Palin clips would have been in heavy circulation tonight and tomorrow, especially in light of the mini-press corps revolt that everyone was talking about yesterday.</p> <p>I think the McCain campaign knew the Couric interview would be a disaster as soon as it was done taping and spent much of the day frantically trying to think of a way to push it out of the headlines. The clincher for me is the fact that McCain cancelled his Letterman appearance at the last second and instead sat down for an impromptu interview with, of all people, Katie Couric. The hope was to bump the Palin interview even on the CBS Evening News, which otherwise would have hyped and teased the Palin interview all afternoon and used it to lead the broadcast. Instead, CBS devoted most of its coverage to McCain and played segments of the Palin interview almost as an afterthought. Mission accomplished.</p> </blockquote> <p>Some of you may be thinking that's just too cynical a read. But this really is how campaigns think. They're in a competition, and the media are an important part of that competition, and they try to do everything they can to play up advantages and contain disadvantages. It actually makes sense that they think this way, to a point. Except that, as I've written many times now, no campaign in modern American history has been as slavishly devoted to winning the day's news cycle \u2013 often at the expense of longer-term thinking \u2013 as the McCain campaign. The decision to cancel Letterman and hastily schedule Couric is the tip-off. They wanted Palin bumped from the nightly news, and they didn't want that particular clip to get heavy cable rotation.</p> <p>I still think <a href=\"http://blog.newsweek.com/blogs/stumper/archive/2008/09/24/on-davis-s-ties-to-freddie-mac-mccain-gets-boomeranged.aspx\">the Rick Davis business</a> was more germane to the ploy. But it all amounts to the same thing really. Cynical day-to-day, seat-of-the-pants insta-calculations designed to gain the upper hand that day. The Palin selection itself was nothing more than that. McCain and Steve Schmidt needed to steal headlines that Friday, and Palin was the biggest headline stealer.</p> <p>Think about that as a way to run a country.<br></p>",
  "<h2>What has gone wrong with the banking bail-out plan?</h2> <p>After sending shares soaring last Friday, the plan by the US treasury secretary, Hank Paulson, and the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, to save <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/wallstreet\">the US banking system</a> with $700bn from the US taxpayer is now looking shaky. The pair have just spent two gruelling days in front of the congressional and Senate banking committees, where US politicians \"kicked the tyres\" of the proposal. It is now far from clear that it will be voted through, and certainly not without some significant changes.</p> <h2>What are the key concerns?</h2> <p>Critics of the proposal fall into three camps \u2013 those who feel that the plan as it stands is much too vague, those who balk at rescuing Wall Street's finest (and richest) from a mess of their own making, and those who shudder at the very idea of such government intervention. Republican senator Jim Bunning vocalised the ideological opposition on Wednesday, calling the scheme \"financial socialism,\" and \"un-American\". And those who feel that Paulson and Bernanke's bright idea is full of holes will probably agree with Chris Dodd, chair of the Senate banking committee, who called it \"stunning and unprecedented in its scope and lack of detail\".</p> <h2>So just how much trouble is the bail-out in?</h2> <p>When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/25/wallstreet.useconomy\">the US president goes on live TV to say that the country's economy - and therefore the rest of the world - is in grave peril</a>, you know that the stakes are about as high as they get.</p> <h2>Can the two sides come together?</h2> <p>Paulson and Bernanke have already yielded <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/24/wallstreet.georgebush\">some ground</a>, including an agreement that banks which benefit from the scheme must also rein in their executive pay. They are trying to hold firm against the tide of criticism, arguing that taxpayers already stand to benefit from the plan, as it will save them from the financial abyss. One possible concession that might make a big difference would be if the government could take stakes in the banks in return for taking distressed assets off their hands. But they have less chance of persuading the likes of Senator Bunning that financial socialism is nothing to be scared of.</p> <h2>How does this tie in with the presidential race?</h2> <p>Either Barack Obama or John McCain will inherit this mess at the beginning of next year, and both have already expressed concern about the bail-out. McCain delivered another shock yesterday, announcing he was suspending campaigning to help fight the problem in Washington (although the cynical reaction was that this was just another panicky vote-grabbing initiative). Bush, Obama and McCain are due to meet with various congressional leaders later today, in the hope of hammering a deal out.</p> <h2>How long have we got to find a solution?</h2> <p>Hardly any time at all. The US administration has demanded an agreement by the end of the weekend. But as the clock keeps ticking and the horse trading continues, there is still no bill to put to the vote. Democrat sources yesterday said they hoped to get the debate started on Thursday. If everyone talks fast, and works over the weekend, then it could be nailed before Monday. If not, then brace yourself for more <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketturmoil\">mayhem on the markets</a> next week. </p> <h2>How is the financial world reacting?</h2> <p>The markets are worried - trading was subdued in Europe today, as investors waited for developments. Once again, the UK banks are refusing to lend to each other, putting their money in the Bank of England instead. If the bailout flounders, the credit crunch could enter a new and even more alarming phase.</p>",
  "<p>This week, over 150 world leaders are gathered at the UN for the opening of the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/ga/\">general assembly</a>. If recent years are any indication, news outlets will focus on the disagreements aired on Tuesday, when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/sep/23/george.bush.united.nations\">George Bush</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/sep/23/mahmoud.ahmadinejad.united.nations\">Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a> took the podium. </p> <p>But the real drama occurs today (Thursday), when the same global leaders that butted heads earlier in the week take stock of one of the most far-reaching and noble statements of international cooperation ever agreed upon, the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/\">millennium development goals</a>. </p> <p>These eight <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/alloutonpoverty\">benchmarks</a>, agreed upon at the World Summit in 2000, are meant to be a statement of world support for the idea that all the world's citizens have the right to basic healthcare, education and nutrition, and the mechanisms necessary to support themselves, among other things. This week's meeting roughly marks the midpoint to the 2015 target date. </p> <p>So far, the glass <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/24/unitednations.internationalaidanddevelopment\">looks half empty</a>, but time has not yet run out. What is required now above all is a renewed commitment to global development on the part of the US, which, despite the recent economic downturn, remains the world's largest economy and dominant power.</p> <p>First, the good news. Thanks to improvements in prevention programmes and the availability of anti-retroviral treatments, we are starting to see a decline in the number of people who are becoming infected and dying from HIV/Aids for the first time since the UN started collecting data. Measles is also on the decline. Deaths from measles fell from 750,000 worldwide in 2000 to under 250,000 in 2007. Investments in malaria prevention are also showing results. The distribution of life-saving insecticide-treated bed nets is now widespread in 16 out of 20 malaria-endemic countries. Finally, thanks to campaigns to forgive the debts of so-called \"highly indebted poor countries\", the share of developing countries' export earnings devoted to paying external debts has fallen from 12.5% in 2000 to 6.6% in 2006.</p> <p>We have seen some progress. But data shows that it has been spread unevenly across the globe. The situation in sub-Saharan Africa remains particularly bleak. The global economic slowdown and rising cost of food has hit this region the hardest. The goal of reducing by half the number of people who live on a dollar a day will not be met there. To make matters worse, higher food prices threaten to push 100m more people into poverty and erode the measured progress we have made toward reducing childhood malnutrition. To compound all of these problems, international trade negotiations (the so-called Doha round) are years behind schedule and, even if they succeed, are in danger of being less development-focused than was once hoped.</p> <p>Still, there is enough time for us to reach most, if not all, of these goals. The US will play a pivotal role in whether or not those goals are achieved. The first thing we need to do is increase foreign aid. Americans are a generous people, and we expect the same of our government. But most Americans would be surprised to learn, however, that only 0.17% of our gross national income goes to government-sponsored development assistance programmes. That puts the US second to last (ahead of Greece) among developed countries' official development assistance expenditures. True, our philanthropic and private sectors are much more active than in any other country. But even the wealthiest philanthropy is no substitute for what the federal government can do.</p> <p>Just throwing money at the problem, however, is not the answer. We also need to reorganise our entire foreign aid apparatus, which has not undergone a significant overhaul since 1961. According to the <a href=\"http://modernizingforeignassistance.net/index.html\">Modernising Foreign Assistance Network</a>, US foreign assistance is spread across as many as 24 government agencies and 50 programmes. The Treasury department, state department, department of agriculture and sub-cabinet-level agencies like USAID and the Millennium Challenge Corporation compete with each other for precious foreign aid dollars. On top of that, individual members of Congress often add earmarks to fund foreign aid projects of their own parochial interests instead of what's best for those in need.</p> <p>We need a strategic and comprehensive view of how to spend taxpayer dollars more wisely and toward a common purpose. The Modernising Foreign Assistance Network advises that the next president fold these multiple arms of our aid apparatus into a single entity, which they recommend as a cabinet-level department of global development. Clearly, a foreign aid bureaucracy developed in 1961 needs to be updated to meet 21st-century challenges. </p> <p>There are hopeful signs that both our presidential candidates get this. Barack Obama has proposed doubling America's foreign development assistance to $50bn. And, like Obama, John McCain considers eliminating extreme poverty and fighting HIV/Aids imperative to American national security interests. </p> <p>These are decent first steps, but not enough. Fighting global poverty today is a wise down payment on a more stable and prosperous future. The millennium development goals tells us what needs to be done to live in a world free of extreme, endemic poverty. The next president can show us how to get there.</p>",
  "<p>The most interesting section of <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/reutersEdge/idUKLNE48N01H20080924\">Gordon Brown's speech</a> on Tuesday was his drawing of dividing lines between Labour and the Conservatives on the economy, presenting Labour as the party to step in to protect people and the Tories as a party that would leave it to the market to decide: \" ... no rescue of Northern Rock, no action on speculation, no protection for mortgages, doing nothing to stop banks going under\". Labour's prospects in the next election depend decisively on whether this argument can be developed into clear and widely understood differences between the two main parties.</p> <p>No solution is offered by the \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/17/labour.labourleadership\">rebels</a>\" who want to precipitate the removal of Gordon Brown. Even though they wish to plunge the Labour party into a drawn-out leadership process most are not prepared to say in public who they want to replace the prime minister. I completely distrust, as will the public, a campaign with an immediate tactical objective but not motivated by any stated policy content \u2013 either in terms of the British economy or over foreign policy, or on global warming or anything else for that matter. It is policy that has to be addressed.</p> <p>A financial hurricane is destroying the economic majority consensus that has dominated British politics since Margaret Thatcher came to power. When New Labour won the 1997 general election it did not propose to dismantle the basic economic framework of the Reagan and Thatcher era, but to weld onto it more steps on social justice, the environment and other measures. This was the \"third way\".</p> <p>Now everyone admits that we are witnessing the greatest financial crisis since 1929. The financial structure of the Reagan-led era is disintegrating around us.</p> <p>In the US a deeply right-wing Republican president has carried out, with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and AIG, the largest nationalisations in the history of the world outside a revolution \u2013 taking over institutions whose assets are more than twice the size of Britain's GDP. Far from markets being left to run themselves, the US government is intervening on a daily, and in some cases an hourly, basis.</p> <p>Labour's policy was initially hamstrung from responding to this adequately by the acceptance of the legacy of Thatcherism. Compare the rapid nationalisation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the largest non-governmental financial institutions in the world, with the protracted period before Northern Rock was taken over \u2013 something which undoubtedly damaged the government's reputation on the economy. Nonetheless, in his speech to conference yesterday, Gordon Brown was right to say that the difference with Cameron is now crystal clear \u2013 the Tory policy was to let Northern Rock fold in the name of Thatcherite dogma.</p> <p>Similarly, there will be decisive choices on taxation and spending. We are facing a huge public spending crunch. Over the next three years borrowing will be <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/542f8680-82a0-11dd-a019-000077b07658.html\">\u00a365bn higher</a> than the Treasury's last projections \u2013 largely due to the economic slowdown precipitated by the current financial meltdown. The decisive question, the consequences of which will touch every person in the country, is who will pay for the collapse of the Reaganite-Thatcherite financial system? So far, the public have feared that the government may make them pay that price and they are nervous and apprehensive as a result. That is why our poll ratings are so dreadful. Brown is now seeking to project, both with his conference speech and with his welcome comments last week about cleaning up the financial markets, the view that only Labour can protect people in these circumstances. He is totally right and people can understand this clear position. The Tories will make ordinary people pay twice over \u2013 first for the construction of the financial system of Thatcherism and Reaganism and then for its collapse.</p> <p>The adequate means to ensure Labour protects people are at hand. At present a windfall tax on energy companies, progressive taxation on higher earners, scrapping the absurdly costly plan for a new generation of nuclear weapons to replace Trident, and putting an end to military adventures such as Iraq would generate quite sufficient resources to mean there was no need for economic attacks on ordinary voters. They would finance real aid for people in facing high energy bills and help those worried about losses from falling house prices.</p> <p>But it is quite possible this financial crisis will deepen further \u2013 that Northern Rock and HBOS will be the start of it, not its culmination. It is therefore vital that, unlike with Northern Rock, Labour is prepared to take decisive immediate action and not be shackled by disintegrating Tory dogmas.</p> <p>George Bush and Hank Paulson have been prepared for the state to act decisively and quickly in a way Labour was not, and we should take a leaf out of their book \u2013 not in what they do, but in their understanding that faced with events of this magnitude only the state has the scale of resources required to take decisive action.</p> <p>Strategically there are a number of key conclusions. This financial crisis is shifting the centre of growth of the world economy even more clearly to Brazil, Russia, India and China \u2013 the Bric economies. It is here that the UK must be building its key new links and it should be de-emphasising the relatively stagnant, and now crisis-ridden, US economy.</p> <p>Even Bush has been forced to give voice to the anger in the US at the way so many American companies avoid paying tax through offshore tax havens. So this is a time for Britain and America to create new financial rules to squeeze these tax havens out of existence.</p> <p>The economic system constructed under Thatcher and Reagan is collapsing around us. The Tory party was partly responsible for this failed system and this gives Labour the opportunity to take the offensive \u2013 provided it is bold and draws the necessary conclusions.</p> <p>Gordon Brown now has an opportunity to set Labour's agenda for the coming decade.</p> <p>Labour has to take the arguments of his speech that addressed these issues and follow through with policies that will protect the public. As someone is going to have to pay the price for this economic crisis, Labour has to make clear it will not be the people the party must represent but the Tories whose Thatcherite system created this mess in the first place.</p>",
  "<p>Russia has launched a full-scale investigation into last night's \"audacious\" assassination of Ruslan Yamadayev, a former MP and bitter rival of Chechnya's pro-Kremlin president Ramzan Kadyrov.</p> <p>Yamadayev, 46, was shot dead early yesterday evening outside the British embassy in central Moscow. He had stopped his black Mercedes at a red traffic light when his assailant, sitting in an Audi, opened fire.</p> <p>Yamadayev died instantly. His passenger, a former military commander in Chechnya, Sergei Kizyun, was seriously wounded. The killer then escaped, driving off along Moscow's river embankment and past its White House.</p> <p>Yamadayev's extended family has been involved in a bitter clan feud with Kadyrov, and represented one of the few sources of genuine opposition towards the president inside the violence-plagued and unstable Caucasus republic. </p> <p>His brother Sulim Yamadayev, a former Chechen rebel, was involved in a standoff with Kadyrov in April, when his convoy refused to yield when the president tried to drive past. Several people were reportedly killed in an ensuing gun battle.</p> <p>Kadyrov angrily dismissed Yamadayev as commander of the Vostok battalion, a group of ex-Chechen militants who defected to Moscow in 2003. He also issued a warrant for Yamadayev's arrest, accusing him and his family of murder, torture and other crimes.</p> <p>Today, a brother of Ruslan and Sulim alleged Kadyrov was behind last night's well-planned execution. Isa Yamadayev told Kommersant newspaper: \"Our family has information that he [Kadyrov] was preparing a reprisal.\"</p> <p>Today, however, Kadyrov denied involvement. Lema Gudayev, a spokeswoman for Kadyrov, told Interfax: \"He was shocked to learn about this. It is well known that Kadyrov's principled position was that a court should find out what crimes the brothers Yamadayev have in fact committed, and make a decision on their responsibility.\"</p> <p>Kadyrov, who became Chechen president in February 2007, has previously been accused of the murder of the campaigning journalist Anna Politkovskaya. Politkovskaya, an outspoken Kadyrov critic, was shot dead outside her Moscow apartment in October 2006. </p> <p>This morning's Russian newspaper ran gruesome front-page photos of Ruslan Yamadayev slumped on the driver's seat of his luxury Mercedes S600, his white shirt and chest covered with blood. \"President Kadyrov has lost his biggest enemy,\" Kommersant noted.</p> <p>According to Russian media reports, investigators are now examining several theories. These include that Ruslan was the victim of a mistaken identity, and that the real target was his brother Sulim. They are also examining whether his killing may have been linked to Yamadayev's lucrative casino business in Moscow.</p> <p>Officials have rushed to rule out Kadyrov's involvement, suggesting the Yamadayev family's support inside Chechnya, based in their stronghold in the Chechen city of Gudermes, is now negligible. </p> <p>Yamadayev fought against the Russian army during Chechnya's separatist war in the 1990s, but then defected to the Kremlin side during the second Chechen war, which began in 1999. </p> <p>In 2004, the then president, Vladimir Putin, rewarded his loyalty with a hero of Russia award. Yamadayev was also made a deputy in Russia's state Duma, and served until 2007 as a member of Putin's United Russia party.</p>",
  "<p>Until mid-afternoon yesterday, the biggest story of the day was the allegation, made by the New York Times, that a firm owned by John McCain's campaign manage had received <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/24/uselections2008.johnmccain1\">tens of thousands of dollars in regular payments</a> from the mortgage lender Freddie Mac - which is deeply implicated in the current economic crisis - until as recently as last month. The other big news was Obama's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/sep/24/uselections2008.barackobama\">nine-point lead</a> in a Washington Post opinion poll. Then came a shock announcement from the McCain campaign that wiped both stories, along with most others, from the news agenda. It seems possible that this wasn't entirely a coincidence. </p> <p>McCain <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/24/uselections2008.johnmccain3\">declared that he was suspending his campaigning</a> and returning from New York to Washington in order to help broker a bipartisan agreement on the bailout proposal, which is still being angrily debated in Congress. He urged Obama to do the same - and requested a postponement of the first debate of the general election season, due to take place tomorrow in Oxford, Mississippi. </p> <p>Now was not the time for partisan politics, he said. But the political advantages of the move were obvious: if Obama consented to a postponement, McCain would emerge as the bipartisan leader, taking charge in a crisis. And if Obama didn't go along with the plan, McCain could still say he'd tried to take the higher road. </p> <p>Obama didn't go along with the plan: to do so would have been tactically brainless. Instead, at a press conference in Florida, he argued that it was more important now than ever for voters to hear what the presidential candidates had to say - and he didn't show much patience for McCain's suggestion that the crisis meant the debate couldn't proceed. \"It is going to be part of the president's job to deal with more than one thing at once,\" he noted. Obama's campaign said they'd been caught unawares by the McCain announcement. Earlier in the afternoon, the two men had apparently agreed by telephone to issue a joint statement on the Wall Street situation. (Each campaign sought to present the joint statement as its own idea.) </p> <p>Later yesterday evening, in a televised address to the nation, President Bush warned that \"our entire economy is in danger\" if a rescue plan could not be agreed. Both presidential candidates are expected to meet him at the White House today. </p> <h2>What to watch out for</h2> <p>Honestly, who knows? Predicting the shape of this election season is rapidly turning into a fool's game. Assuming Obama holds fast on tomorrow's debate, all eyes will be on McCain today as he choreographs the shift from trying to call off the debate to showing up in Mississippi anyway. Assuming he does. What on earth happens if only Obama is there? </p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>There were no significant changes in the daily tracking polls; Gallup had no change at all, putting <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/110647/Gallup-Daily-Obama-Maintains-3Point-Edge.aspx\">Obama at 47% and McCain at 44%</a>. An <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-poll25-2008sep25,0,4911734.story\">LA Times/Bloomberg poll</a> put the candidates at 49%-45% among likely voters.

The first is George Bush's attempt to drum up public support and stiffen Republican resolve to accept the administration's $700bn (\u00a3377bn) financial rescue plan in the face of widespread scepticism in Congress. The second is John McCain's bombshell about putting his campaign on hold, a decision that drew criticism from late night talk show host David Letterman (see above).</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.salon.com/tech/htww/2008/09/25/bush_bailout_speech/\">Andrew Leonard at Salon</a> criticises Bush for not doing enough to reassure Americans as Roosevelt had done during the Depression. But Bush failed to bring along \"angry Americans or doubting members of Congress that the Paulson plan delivers a fair and equitable resolution to the crisis that faces us\".</p> <p>Henry Paulson, the US treasury secretary, gets <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/anatole_kaletsky/article4820549.ece\">a thorough roasting from Anatole Kaletsky in the Times</a>. The financial commentator says his impressions of Paulson's ineptitude at the start of the financial crisis were reinforced by Paulson's clueless and waffling performance on Capitol Hill when questioned about the rescue plan.</p> <blockquote> <p>Not only did Mr Paulson not know what he was doing. He did not know what he was talking about.</p> </blockquote> <p>For Kaletsky the former chairman of Goldman Sachs \"is to finance what Donald Rumsfeld was to military strategy, Dick Cheney to geopolitics and Michael Chertoff to flood defence.\"</p> <p>Similar blows rain on the Bush administration in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/sep/25/georgebush.republicans\">Timothy Garton Ash's report card</a> on the Bush years in the Guardian.</p> <p>Summing up the last eight years as hubris followed by nemesis, Garton Ash writes: \"The irony of the Bush years is that a man who came into office committed to both celebrating and reinforcing sovereign, unbridled national power has presided over the weakening of that power in all three dimensions: military, economic and soft.\"</p> <p>The other big story is John McCain's extraordinary decision to call for a postponement of tomorrow's TV debate and a suspension of the presidential campaign, in a move described as a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/24/AR2008092403950.html?hpid=topnews\">huge gamble by the Washington Post</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>What he risks, if things don't go as he hopes, is a judgment by voters that his move was a reckless act by an impetuous and struggling politician that hardened partisan lines in Washington at just the wrong moment and complicated efforts to deal with the biggest financial crisis in more than half a century.</p> </blockquote> <p>At Slate, <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2200867/\">John Dickerson is unsure whether the McCain move was desperate or brilliant</a>. Either way, there will be probably more such stunts.</p> <blockquote> <p>The beneficial effects of the Palin Hail Mary lasted only a few weeks, and another adrenaline injection was needed. If this one doesn't work, that's OK - in due time they can try another razzle-dazzle play. And if it does work, that's great - in due time they can still try another razzle-dazzle play. It all makes the prospect of a McCain White House very exciting. So exciting, he might want to schedule periodic suspensions of his presidency to get anything done.</p> </blockquote> <p>McCain's announcement led to much fun-poking from Letterman. <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/24/john-mccain-cancels-lette_n_128998.html\">Letterman's barbs, picked up by the Huffington Post</a>, include this one: \"What are you going to do if you're elected and things get tough? Suspend being president? We've got a guy like that now!\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2008/9/25/12317/6754/599/609603\">The Daily Kos has a poll</a> asking who Obama should debate if he turns up tomorrow. Nine percent vote for Paulson, but the biggest vote \u2013 31% - goes to a picture of McCain.</p> <p>On a more serious note, the Guardian's Nils Pratley writes that the idea that Congress might not back the bail-out unveiled by the US treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, is terrifying the markets.</p> <blockquote> <p>You can't see the strain in share prices but in the money markets. Overnight money is flowing only because central banks are pumping money into the system. But the rates at which banks are lending to each other have rocketed.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>This is an extended extract from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/wrap\">The Wrap</a>, guardian.co.uk's digest of the day's media.</em></p>",

  "<p>Last week a leaked government document revealed that <a href=\"http://www.euractiv.com/en/climate-change/uk-wants-offsets-eu-climate-regime/article-175507\">Labour ministers are lobbying the EU</a> to allow Britain to meet up to half of its 2020 emissions <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/emission/linking_en.htm\">reductions targets</a> by buying credits from the developing world.</p> <p>It is true that a tonne of carbon dioxide pollution saved in Bangalore is the same as a tonne saved in Birmingham \u2013 but by <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/08/35&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en\"> paying others to make carbon reductions for us</a>, Labour are selling Britain short by subsidising abroad the efficiencies and savings we need to make at home.</p> <p>There are many thousands of new and well-paid jobs that could be created in the UK with a major national push on energy efficiency, microgeneration and renewable energy technologies. If we are only to pick the lowest hanging fruit of cheap emissions reductions in Britain and then just turn to the carbon markets to pay developing countries to fill the gap on the cheap, then we will be passing on the opportunity to lead the world in the conversion to a low-carbon economy.</p> <p>If we opt to only make the minimum of reductions here at home we will still lumber on with business as usual, using old and energy inefficient practice. This will lock in a new generation of polluting infrastructure that will become increasingly expensive for us to offset in the future, as the cost of polluting increases with a rising carbon price.</p> <p>This is not the way it has to be \u2013 and not the way the <a href=\"http://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def=news.story.page&amp;obj_id=129351\">Conservative party views the climate challenge</a>. Other countries are embracing change: Germany already has over 250,000 jobs in renewable technologies. Yet Britain has, at best, 15,000. We don't even know exactly how many green tech jobs we have in the UK because the government doesn't bother to count them.</p> <p>Both Barack Obama and John McCain have declared that they see 5 million <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/26/business/businessspecial2/26collar.html\">\"green collar\"</a> jobs being created in the new US energy economy. Indeed it is expected that global green industries will be worth \u00a3350bn a year by 2010 \u2013 as big as the global aerospace industry is today. That is the opportunity before us today \u2013 and we can be sure that if Britain doesn't move to seize this new market, others will. </p> <p>No one pretends that squeezing more efficiency out of our economy will be easy, but at a time of economic stress for Britain Gordon Brown should be looking for ways to create more jobs in the UK, not lobbying to use tax payers' money to create green tech jobs overseas. While the reduction of carbon being dumped into the atmosphere will be the same regardless of where it happens \u2013 and it must happen \u2013 our political leaders must ensure that as much of the economic opportunity as possible remains here in Britain.</p>"
