  "<h2>Sean, you spoilsport</h2> <p>Sean Connery's memoir, Being a Scot, has finally seen the light of day. Hats off then to 'co-author' Murray Grigor. Two previous ghostwriters - Meg Henderson and Hunter Davies - had deals cancelled after attempts to discuss the actor's tumultuous private life were repeatedly refused. The original publisher, Canongate, also left the project. 'We thought it could be a book that was absolutely personal, but it was a book about Scotland,' MD Jamie Byng sniffed. New publisher Weidenfeld confirms the absence of 'titillating revelations', but promises 'a vivid portrait' of Connery's homeland. We can hardly wait.</p> <h2>Random changes</h2> <p>The Browser was depressed to learn that Random House and children's author Jacqueline Wilson have agreed to emend all future editions of the writer's latest work, My Sister Jodie, so that the word 'twat' is replaced by the word 'twit'. Out of 150,000 copies sold, Random House pointed out, there had been just three complaints. Clearly, the capitulation was prompted not by public outrage but by Asda's decision not to stock the book until the 'offending' word was excised. Odd, then, that Asda is still selling Roald Dahl's children's classic James and the Giant Peach. Does the supermarket not know that the book features no fewer than two mentions of the word 'ass'? What an outrage! Better cancel the next consignment from Puffin Books quick ...</p> <h2>Publisher polls best</h2> <p>The latest weapon in the battle for the White House? A picture-book biography. My Dad, John McCain, a charming account of the senator's life by his daughter, Meghan, has gone head to head with the decidedly saccharine Barack Obama: Son of Promise, Child of Hope ('Ever since Barack Obama was young, Hope has lived inside him'). Sadly, the subtitle of Hillary Clinton's version - Dreams Taking Flight - did not prove prophetic. The only certain winner is Simon &amp; Schuster, which seems to have cornered the market in pre-school presidential publishing.</p>",
  "<p>The news that pensioners now outnumber teenagers under 16 should surprise nobody. This statistic has been sailing slowly but surely towards us like a stately Saga cruise ship for decades and we have been unable to change its course. Here they come, stacking the decks, those floating millions of elderly, some active, some angry, some happy, some depressed, some hardly sentient, some wishing they were dead.</p> <p>They are not going to go away. They multiply more rapidly than their fecund grandchildren reproduce. The crowds thicken. I am one of them. I will be 70 on my next birthday. I have been drawing my state pension and riding joyfully around London on my freedom pass for years, though I have yet to test my nationwide free bus pass. I am gripped now by articles about age discrimination as I was once gripped by columns about childbirth. </p> <p>Demography has warned us for years that an expensive pensions problem was looming and that higher state funding was never going to be a popular move. Since Mrs Thatcher cut the link between pensions and earnings in 1980, poorer pensioners have been dropping behind in real terms and now face increasing food poverty and fuel poverty, alleviated by state hand-outs.</p> <p>In 2012, a major and long-debated reform will attempt to rectify this, but that's still a long way off and still like Banquo's ghosts we multiply.</p> <p>Meanwhile, there have been adjustments. Some involve the compulsory retirement age - it is no longer as easy to sack people at 60 or 65 - and convincing arguments have been advanced in favour of the productivity and expertise of the over-sixties. Not only judges and law lords and Senator McCain are at their best in their seventies. (But the over-sixties will soon be over-eighties, looking forward to their 90th and 100th birthday parties - what about them?)</p> <p>Harriet Harman's Equality Bill, introduced in June this year, received wide coverage, but mostly for its curbs on sexism and racism in the workplace; less was written about its attack on automatic discrimination against the elderly by insurance and travel companies. I'm not sure what changes were made here or how they will affect me. The commentators were too young to bother to comment.</p> <p>We live longer than we used to, but not always in better health. Fairly but perhaps ominously, experts are beginning to point out that our prolonged life expectancy does not always mean that we survive to enjoy a fit and independent old age.</p> <p>We may survive major illnesses, indeed several major illnesses, with the help of medication and radiotherapy and surgical intervention, but then find ourselves reduced to a life of bags and drips and pads and scans and wheelchairs and possibly of pain. </p> <p>Do we really want that? Dignity in Dying knows that some of us do not. Care homes are usually depressing and their staff occasionally sadistic and no wonder, when the pay for carers is so poor and the work perceived as undignified. We don't want to end up there, but we know that, statistically, many of us will.</p> <p>Medical ingenuity sometimes seems to exist for its own sake and to create its own doctor's dilemmas. Last week, we learnt that NHS dentists are doing more extractions and providing more dentures and making fewer crowns. The new contract has been largely blamed for this, but it is obvious that the over-eighties are likely to be less suitable for and less keen on lengthy rescue interventions than their juniors. The brilliance of modern dentistry can be its nemesis. I speak feelingly, as the victim of failed implants.</p> <p>The public has no sympathy with dental casualties - look how meanly they laughed at Martin Amis. And I am sorry to report that Charles Lamb, apparently the kindest of men, upset Dorothy Wordsworth by making fun of her false teeth. She had suffered enough, poor woman. We all sail towards that bourn from which no traveller returns - sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything - and we should keep one another company and refrain from ill-placed mockery. </p> <p>The swelling ranks of vocal and articulate elderly have a powerful role to play. David Lodge's recent novel, Deaf Sentence, is not only a gripping narrative, it is also a plea for understanding of his narrator's condition. Being deaf is not funny, although many seem to think it is. His book is a testimony to increasing millions of sufferers and those who read it will surely respond to the deaf with more sensitivity. </p> <p>The growing mass of old people is, of course, a considerable market force and we should be encouraged to help you spend your way out of recession. Some of us still have a fair amount of disposable income, which Saga has been notably successful at exploiting. My husband Michael and I went on a Saga cruise last Christmas, surrounded by sufferers from every known geriatric complaint - it made us feel very nimble as we nipped ahead of the breakfast queue.</p> <p>We discovered that some people take several cruises a year and spend much of their lives afloat - they return from the Canaries, dock at Southampton and take off the next day for the West Indies or the Arctic. A few of our fellow travellers had clearly (and rightly) been evicted by their children and grandchildren for the festivities: 'Give them a cruise for Christmas and get rid of them!'</p> <p>The old are restless. A few years ago, while lecturing to a bright and intelligent over-fifties Elderhostel Group on the QE2, we met the woman who buried her husband at sea and now lives permanently aboard playing bridge, claiming it's cheaper than a care home. She seemed very happy.</p> <p>The Mick Jagger generation won't want to sit around at home watching daytime TV, as a pensions minister recently pointed out. Many of them want to see the world, engage with their neighbours and go to evening classes and learn to dance.</p> <p>We don't like being portrayed officially as dodderers with sticks and bent backs who are a menace on the roads and we object to patronising jokes about silver surfers. We want to choose to grow old gracefully, like the Queen or disgracefully, like John Mortimer and Beryl Cook, or not at all, like Helen Mirren. We don't want to be lumped into a category.</p> <p>I have been haunted by novelist Natalia Ginzburg's chilling aphorism, relayed to her, I think, by her mother: 'An old woman should not cause offence.'</p> <p>And perhaps there is some onus on us, as the elderly, not to inflict the spectacle of our decline too cruelly upon the young. None of us wants to be a memento mori. We must keep up appearances.</p> <p>But having said that, I celebrate Chichester and those quiet seaside towns and West Country villages where the elderly now cluster. There is something calm and reassuring about the slow pace, the charity shops selling old clothes and jigsaws, the little dogs, the pensioners' pub lunches, the coffee shops, the flower shows in the churches, the rituals of the wet English summer holiday.</p> <p>Nobody is in a hurry. Nobody wants to be a celebrity or to spot a celebrity. Life goes on, much as it did in Elizabeth Gaskell's Cranford. So may it long continue.</p>",
  "<p>For once, it is no exaggeration to say the eyes of the world will be upon him. Up to 1.6 billion people will today watch Boris Johnson wave the Olympic flag at the closing ceremony of the Beijing Games, signalling London's acceptance of the awesome responsibility of staging the spectacle in 2012. As Lord Coe, who led the London bid, put it: 'Let's hope he doesn't drop it.'</p> <p>Quite. For Johnson's performance is more than a matter of sporting pride. He carries the torch now for the new Conservatism. He is the only elected Tory who currently enjoys real executive power, the man who offers - like it or not, and lately he has liked it perhaps less than he did - voters a chance to try the Cameroon brand before they buy it at the next election.</p> <p>Who could blame him if a little of this newfound power went to his head? After little more than 100 days running London, some of them distinctly difficult, could Johnson already be dreaming of stepping to the top of the political podium?</p> <p>Two events shed new light on the scope of Johnson's ambition. The first was a newspaper column Johnson wrote suggesting that sporting triumphs showed it was 'piffle' to suggest that Britain was 'a broken society, in which the courage and morals of young people have been sapped by welfarism and political correctness'. Given that the politician making that claim was the Conservative leader David Cameron, was that a direct tilt at his boss?</p> <p>Second was the departure of his first deputy mayor, Tim Parker, the millionaire businessman famed for ruthless cost cutting, after Johnson annexed much of his job; according to City Hall insiders, Parker was in fact removed after Johnson was warned that the tycoon was usurping too much of his own authority. The move is the first evidence that the easy-going Johnson has now learnt to be ruthless in protection of his power base.</p> <p>These two events have subtly altered the public perception of Johnson as a genial, bumbling maverick somehow above base politics, although to those who know him best, it was never true in the first place.</p> <p>Certainly, he comes from a fiercely competitive family, albeit the kind in which competition is genteelly disguised. Boris Johnson is the best known of the four children - he featured in the BBC's Who Do You Think Your Are? last week - born to conservationist Stanley Johnson and his painter wife Charlotte, but none is a shrinking violet. His novelist sister Rachel is fast becoming as ubiquitous a party guest in smart London circles, while younger siblings Leo and Jo work as a film producer and journalist respectively. As children, Boris and Leo fought 'tigerishly', according to Rachel.</p> <p>Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson was born in New York and educated in Brussels before settling in to the classic high Tory circuit of Eton followed by Oxford. After a brief false start in management consulting, he settled into his natural niche: journalism. The move to Westminster, after more than a decade writing about politics both in Brussels and at home, was in some ways natural and Johnson was elected in 2001 to the safe seat of Henley.</p> <p>One of the few publicly recognisable Tory faces at the time, thanks to his TV appearances, frontbench promotion none the less took three years because of fears that he was a loose cannon, apparently justified when he was forced to resign over an affair with writer Petronella Wyatt.</p> <p>But his great stroke of luck was the election of old Oxford friend David Cameron to the leadership in 2005, leading to his rehabilitation in the more congenial post of shadow higher education spokesman. Despite both being old Etonians, the two did not know each other well at school, but both belonged to the now infamous Bullingdon Club at university; while Cameron has downplayed his membership, the more relaxed Johnson recalled an escapade that ended with crawling through a hedge pursued by police dogs.</p> <p>The Spectator magazine under Johnson's editorship was an early and critical champion of Cameron when conventional Tory wisdom favoured David Davis; this second job was his reward, but he still saw himself in Cameron's debt for it. The scholar in him suited the new brief and he worked hard at it, despite yet another extramarital affair.</p> <p>Even so, Cameron took a huge risk promoting Johnson as the Tory mayoral candidate for London. It would probably never have happened if the high-profile candidate he wanted to stand had come forward; Johnson, who clearly did not want the job, was shoehorned in at the last minute because there was nobody else. So the tables had turned a little; if Johnson could win it, Cameron would now owe him one.</p> <p>Until then, Johnson's political career had been distinguished more by death wish - the gaffes and affairs which apparently ruled him out of high office - than vaulting ambition. But once out campaigning, something seemed to click: he realised that he was actually enjoying it and that he desperately did not want to lose.</p> <p>And despite the chaos of his first few weeks in City Hall, including the forced resignation of another deputy mayor, Ray Lewis, over allegations about his past, Johnson has continued to enjoy it. So much, some colleagues suggest, that he has begun wondering: what next?</p> <p>'Some people develop ambition only when they realise that nothing seems to be getting in their way,' says one senior Tory who knows Johnson well. 'Despite all the evidence that he couldn't run a whelk stall, Boris is now in charge of the best city in the world. He's the only serious executive power in the party, he's enormously popular, he's now strutting around the world stage in Beijing. What's not to do?'</p> <p>Hence, while the mayor and Parker remain on friendly terms, a senior City Hall insider says there is no doubt Johnson squeezed him out to protect his own position.</p> <p>When hired by his friend Francis Maude, the shadow minister managing the transition into power in London, Parker had apparently been led to believe that he would have effective day-to-day control. The mayor was told to expect someone to do the dirty work of cutting costs, allowing the mayor - a man who likes to be liked - to avoid painful confrontation.</p> <p>While an overworked Johnson did not initially notice the empire Parker was building, the rival deputies, particularly the experienced Tory councillor Sir Simon Milton, did.</p> <p>'I think one or two of them will have said, \"Who does he think he is? He seems to think he's the mayor,\"' said a senior City Hall insider. 'That will have given Boris a very, very clear signal.'</p> <p>Parker's departure, then, removed a threat to Johnson while solving a problem for the increasingly frustrated Parker. As it suited both men, it was relatively amicable, but it is the first evidence of a steelier side of Johnson. 'This has been a necessary rite of passage,' the City Hall insider added.</p> <p>But against this background, the newspaper column he published the same day Parker resigned, suggesting the Olympics disproved the myth of a broken society, suddenly resonated.</p> <p>For now, the leadership regards it as more thoughtless accident than malice aforethought. 'People are trying to make more of it than there really was,' says a source close to Cameron. The two are not exactly close, but Cameron remains broadly happy so long as Johnson does well.</p> <p>Yet there was private concern that Johnson's insistence on continuing his journalism would lead to embarrassment and he will come under pressure to stop. It did not help that in an interview published in the latest Total Politics magazine, Johnson failed entirely to quell the rumours, saying only that he 'cannot foresee the circumstances' in which he would run for leader, a formula he did not improve upon yesterday, asked the leadership question again in Beijing.</p> <p>But what may ultimately be more telling is another detail from the China trip. In keeping with his mayoral theme of cutting waste, Johnson's team revealed he was changing what he regarded as overly lavish travel plans for Beijing inherited from Ken Livingstone. The new mayor would switch to a cheaper hotel and fly economy.</p> <p>The hair shirt image was spoilt, however, when it was reported that Johnson's aides unsuccessfully tried to get the mayor an upgrade. Johnson, apparently, was no keener than Livingstone on flying cattle class; he just didn't plan to pay for a better seat. While ambition in a politician is usually forgiven by voters, hypocrisy is not.</p> <p>Boris Johnson can still refine this rather risky act; as one colleague notes, he is 'a good classical scholar and he knows what follows hubris'. London's mayor has every right, representing British athletes, to glow with pride. But he had better hope it does not precede a fall.</p> <h2>The Johnson lowdown</h2> <p><strong>Born </strong>Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, 19 June 1964, in New York, the eldest of four children, to Stanley Johnson, former Conservative MEP, and artist Charlotte Johnson.</p> <p><strong> Education</strong> Eton; Balliol College, Oxford. He was elected president of the Oxford Union on his second campaign.</p> <p><strong> Best of times</strong> On 2 May 2008, Boris was elected mayor of London, beating Ken Livingstone.</p> <p><strong>Worst of times</strong> Johnson was fired from the Times, his first job in journalism, after falsifying a quote to try to inject interest into a story on archaeology.

  "<p>On a short flight to New York recently, I was sitting behind two white, well-dressed twentysomethings chattering loudly about going to clubs and travel plans and the possibility of living in New Jersey. Then came the question: 'So who are you voting for?'</p> <p>'I was for Hillary, but now ... I'm kind of undecided,' volunteered the first woman. 'Are you a Democrat?' asked the second. 'Yeah. But I think I might go with McCain. It's just that, well, I don't know.' Her voice dropped. I leant forward to hear. 'You kind of hate to say it aloud, but ...' Her voice dropped again, lost in the roar of the jet engines, and I missed whatever came next.</p> <p>Let's start with this concession: I have no idea what that young woman actually said. In a perfect world, I suppose that would be the end of the story and I would go back to minding my own business. In the context of contemporary political discourse, however, it did cross my mind that, if this conversation was presented on one of those 'finish the sentence' cultural-literacy tests, then pretty much every American, of whatever creed, colour, or class, would have exactly the same guess as to how the woman completed her thought.</p> <p>There's some consensus, in other words, about the one thing in America we really 'hate to say' aloud. Yet by refraining from saying audibly that-which-must-not-be-spoken, was the young woman's political choice rendered rational, neutral, pure? Conversely, if I were to spell it out here, would I be the one accused of 'playing the race card'?</p> <p>Everyone knows that race matters to a greater or lesser degree; few of us want to admit it. Indeed, race is the one topic that's probably even more taboo in polite company than sex.</p> <p>Barack Obama predicted this phenomenon and attempted to expose it to the anodyne of common sense: 'They're going to try to make you afraid of me. \"He's young and inexperienced and he's got a funny name. And did I mention he's black?\" ' The not altogether surprising backlash from John McCain's campaign is a deflection, an expression of deep discomfort. The reflexive accusation that Obama was playing the race card has a certain resemblance to the juvenile retort one gets when the science teacher tries to explain the human reproductive system: 'Oh! He said a dirty word!' In this way, the opportunity for thoughtful public analysis sinks, once again, below the sound of the audible. Yet the fear of race rolls on, pantomimed in palpably influential and consequential ways.</p> <p>At the same time the civil rights movement has given us a moral conscience that was not as prevalent when The Birth of a Nation was made. Today it's fair to say that the overwhelming majority of white Americans 'hate to say it aloud' because they also hate to think of themselves as racists. Yet the tendency to turn the commitment to racial liberalism into sheer denial is strong. 'I don't see race' becomes 'I don't see racism'. While some of us are listening to the soothing tones of National Public Radio, a far larger audience is listening to the right-wing radio host Rush Limbaugh singing about subterranean fears of 'Barack, the magic Negro', or to shock jocks cackling about 'jigaboos'. Not that any of them mean it in a racist way. Hey, lighten up. Don't you have a sense of humour?</p> <p>Then there are the very real disparities that burden the lives of the majority of blacks, people of colour and the poor in this country: from the still unrepaired wake of Hurricane Katrina to the greater infant mortality rate and lesser life span, to near double-digit rates of unemployment, to the fact that blacks in New York are eight times more likely than whites to be stopped for marijuana possession, to disproportionately high rates of foreclosures and homelessness among blacks, Native Americans and Latinos, to the almost complete resegregation of schools across the land, to a war on drugs so shockingly racialised and so aggressively executed that our rates of incarceration place us first in the world.</p> <p>We rejoice in the warm symbolism of interracial bliss, particularly in the idealised and thoroughly mythic sphere of celebrity existence. At the same time, there is a terrible ambivalence on the ground. Does one really want 'the race card' living next door, or being your boss? Do you really want your child marrying outside his race? I've had conversations with white friends who are rattled when a black pupil has bested their child in the class rankings and can't let go of the feeling that the mere presence of blacks in the school must be bringing down the test scores.</p> <p>Similarly, it's interesting to review the evolution of media commentary, from TV to the blogosphere, trying to fit the thoroughly unfamiliar Obama into familiar boxes. For a while, he was depicted as not having any 'racial baggage'. Then, in the blink of an eye, he was transformed into someone who could be demonised with all the well-practised repertoire of insults reserved for the Nation of Islam's Louis Farrakhan and armed revolutionaries.</p> <p>Obama's comeback, his eloquent speech about race, showed that he wasn't exactly the same person, not by any means. So in yet another twist, he is now so uppity he needs bringing down, defamed as too famous, categorised as uncategorisable, displaced as unplaceable. Yet the truth is that more is on the record about every step of Obama's life than possibly any candidate on the planet, and so this particular brand of demonisation has been accomplished by the insinuations of erasure.</p> <p>If you took away his 'pretty words', he'd be nothing. If you took away his race, he'd be nothing. If only he didn't have a brain, he'd be nothing, nothing, nothing. It's a circular, nonsensical mantra - magical thinking, wrapped in the fiction of 'but really, I never see race'. This kind of denial masquerading as colour-blind idealism cannot be our compass at this exciting and potentially transformative moment.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Patricia Williams is a professor of law at Columbia University and a regular columnist for the Nation magazine</p>",

  "<p>Joe Biden's long road to the Democratic ticket got off to a bad start. When he launched his own bid for the White House last year, Biden's reputation for committing verbal gaffes was swiftly confirmed. Asked what he thought of a young black senator from Illinois who was also running for President, Biden said Barack Obama was 'the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy'.</p> <p>The result was a firestorm of accusations of patronising racial insensitivity and Biden was forced into an immediate apology. Despite strong showings in the debates, Biden's presidential campaign fizzled out in the snows of Iowa and New Hampshire.</p> <p>But that was then. This is now. Biden is now joining Obama's ticket as his running mate. If the Democrats win in November, Biden will get to the White House after all, albeit as Vice-President.</p> <p>There is one reason why Obama has chosen Biden: his experience. Obama's youth may be the reason tens of thousands flock to his rallies, but it is also his Achilles heel. 'Not ready to lead' is the mantra of Republican attack ads already swarming across the television screens of America. They follow on from the most effective tactics of Hillary Clinton's defeated campaign, when she painted Obama as too naive on foreign policy and unable to deal with international crises.</p> <p>Biden is the answer to those accusations. The senator from the small state of Delaware has been on the national scene of American politics for more than three decades. His speciality is foreign policy. He has just returned from a trip to the war zones of Georgia, where he won plaudits for his efforts to support the beleaguered Georgian government. As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee he has travelled the world meeting foreign leaders, many of whom he counts as friends. </p> <p>That kind of experience will be an asset. So will Biden's background. His family is Irish Catholic and his father, a car salesman, moved them from the poor town of Scranton to Delaware when Biden was just 10 years old. Ironically, Biden's early career showed many similarities to Obama's rise to power. Like Obama, Biden went to college and studied law. Like Obama, Biden was a precociously young politician. He won a seat in the Senate aged just 30, becoming the fifth-youngest senator in American history. </p> <p>However, it was a moment marked by intense personal tragedy. Biden had met his first wife, Neilia Hunter, while at law school. They had three children together. But Hunter and their young daughter were killed in a car accident that also left his two sons seriously injured. Biden considered abandoning his career to care for his stricken family, but was persuaded to keep his seat. He was, in fact, sworn into office at the hospital bedside of one of his sons. Both boys recovered - one is shortly to serve a tour of duty in Iraq - and Biden eventually married again. He has had another daughter with his second wife, Jill Jacobs.</p> <p>In his long political career Biden has carved out a path as a traditional Democrat, strong with unions and the labour movement. Indeed he has been on the national scene for such a long time that he first ran for the White House in 1988. </p> <p>He brings others elements of balance to the Obama campaign, too, shoring up weaknesses that have only become apparent over the last two months of going head-to-head with Republican opponent John McCain. Born in 1942, Biden is reassuringly old for an American electorate that would perhaps have balked at another young politician on Obama's ticket. His style of campaigning is also in stark contrast to Obama's lofty rhetoric and slightly detached intellectual feel. Biden is known as a rough-house campaigner, full of punches and jokes. He is also a formidable debater, whereas Obama's debate performances have sometimes fallen flat.</p> <p>Biden's emotional style and willingness to speak his mind have always made him popular with both core Democratic voters and the press. It is likely to help him appeal to parts of the electorate that Obama has been having trouble attracting. They include the blue-collar, working-class Democrats in states like Ohio and Pennsylvania who embraced Clinton but who have been lukewarm on Obama. Biden's straight talking and his background in Scranton, Pennsylvania, will do much to bring those voters home to Obama. Senior Democrats have flocked to praise the choice of Biden, including Hillary Clinton, whose supporters could claim she has been cruelly snubbed by Obama. </p> <p>But there are pitfalls in Obama's choice. One of those has already been shown. Republican operatives, long suspecting Biden would be the man, travelled to TV studios early yesterday morning. They were clutching their latest attack ad, which was soon hitting the airwaves via the cable news shows. It took advantage of Biden's history of speaking too freely by featuring examples of his attacks on Obama and praise for McCain. </p> <p>'There has been no harsher critic of Barack Obama's lack of experience than Joe Biden,' said McCain spokesman Ben Porritt. That summed up the main risk in choosing Biden. His tongue is notoriously loose and has left a long record. Aside from his gaffe at the start of his own presidential campaign, he has accused Obama of not being ready to be President. He also once said he was willing to run with McCain, not just against him. His jokes and comments can also stoke up fires of controversy that could distract the Obama campaign at key moments. In New Hampshire, while campaigning for votes in his own presidential campaign, Biden once remarked that 'you cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent'. Such off-the-cuff asides are perfect fodder for the ravenous 24-hour news cycle of the modern presidential campaign. They could prove to be a dangerous source of distractions in the tough weeks ahead, especially as McCain's camp will pore over his every utterance. Another problem is that Biden does not bring a swing state with him, as Indiana's Senator Evan Bayh could have done. He is also a Washington insider, which could hurt Obama's claim that he wants to change the system. Finally, choosing a man - rather than Clinton or Kansas governor Kathleen Sibelius - might aggravate women voters. </p> <p>One safe bet is that Biden's speeches will be well prepared and heavily scrutinised. That first presidential campaign in 1988 was seen as a strong one, but it foundered over accusations that he had plagiarised a speech by British Labour party leader Neil Kinnock. Biden had usually credited Kinnock in his speech, but on one occasion when he did not he was caught on video. That triggered a series of other probes into Biden's background and he withdrew from the race saying 'the exaggerated shadow' of his mistakes had come to dominate coverage of his presidential bid.</p> <p>But now Biden is back. Any career as long as his is going to have many peaks and troughs. But few would have predicted that the greatest peaks may yet still lie ahead. The Obama-Biden ticket has a strong chance to take the White House this November.

  "<p>With rich historical resonance and great symbolism, Barack Obama will make his speech to the Democratic convention 45 years to the day since Martin Luther King invited America to share his dream of a country without racial prejudice. Is that freight of symbolism an inspiration to Obama or another weight on his slender shoulders? Probably, I guess, some of both.</p> <p>For he has to be acutely conscious that he is not yet standing on Dr King's mountain top. At the start of an absolutely crucial week in the race for the White House, that summit is both tantalising close and agonisingly distant.</p> <p>George W Bush continues to plumb sub-Nixonian popularity ratings, more than three-quarters of Americans think that their country is on the wrong track, the Republican brand is in the dumpster and voters have been surging to register as Democrats. John McCain is a trigger-happy septuagenarian running for the presidency of a country weary of war. The senator from Arizona also sounds self-satisfied about the state of the American economy when most of its voters are the opposite of content.</p> <p>And yet the convention fortnight begins with the opinion polls making it a statistical dead heat between the two men. Obama's ratings are significantly below those of his party. His earlier advantage over McCain having evaporated in the summer heat, the Democrat needs a big bounce from this week.</p> <p>He's not in trouble with African-American voters. They go on supporting him by whopping margins. It's still Obama by a landslide among younger voters of all colours. His problem is with older white voters. That problem is bigger when these voters are men and when they don't have a college education. It was this substantial segment of white America which refused to be seduced by him during the marathon struggle with Hillary Clinton. It is this group which remains resistant to the political gifts which have mesmerised the rest of the world.</p> <p>For Obama's difficulties, his opponents must get some of the credit. The Republicans might not be much good at running the country, but, boy, they still know how to run a campaign. John McCain, for all his previous pieties denouncing negative campaigning, has hired a gang of propagandists from the dark school of Karl Rove. The sorcerer's apprentices are replicating the Republican strategy, so ruthlessly effective at breaking previous Democrat contenders for the presidency, of painting opponents as alien to a majority of the American people. Their attack ads mock Obama as 'the One'.</p> <p>The intent is to make voters think of him as 'the Other'. When Americans look at Obama, the Republicans want them to see someone too threatening, too different, too unAmerican to put in the White House. Obama saw this coming. A few weeks ago, he made this forecast: 'What they're going to try to do is make you scared of me. You know, \"He's not patriotic enough. He's got a funny name. He doesn't look like all those other Presidents on those dollar bills.\"'</p> <p>By predicting the shape of the beast, he hoped to defang it. What he did not anticipate is that they would even try to turn his charisma against him. Republican attack ads have spliced images of him with Britney Spears and Paris Hilton to paint him as a confected freak of celebrity who is undeserving of his fame and quite unsuited for power. In other attacks, they try to uglify his attractive urbanity and intellectualism by depicting him as aloof and elitist.</p> <p>The official McCain campaign does not mention the colour of Obama's skin. They do not need to. Right-wing smear artists can peddle the untruths that Obama is a closet Muslim and a fellow traveller with terrorism.</p> <p>It seems a paradox, but perhaps it is not, that race is the hardest thing for America to talk about during its first election in which a black man is a serious contender for the presidency. The American media are tentative about approaching the subject and unsure how to measure the extent to which it will affect the outcome. When it comes to race, voters habitually lie to pollsters. Racial prejudice can be bundled into and hidden behind other arguments for not putting Obama inside the Oval Office. When voters tell pollsters or reporters that he is too inexperienced to be commander-in-chief, they may sincerely believe that or they may really be saying that they think he is too black. Some pollsters guess that as many as one in five white voters who would vote Democrat won't do so because of his skin colour.</p> <p>The furore over Jeremiah Wright drew from Obama his brilliant speech about race back in March, but since then he has tried to avoid being drawn on America's most difficult topic of conversation. He does not want the race for the White House to be consumed by an argument about race in America because the eruption of that debate is most likely to repel precisely the sort of white voters he now needs to win.</p> <p>I gained a deeper appreciation of his dilemma after spending the past three weeks travelling through a trio of southern states: Georgia and the Carolinas, North and South. The handsome houses of Charleston and Savannah which were built on the back of slavery now earn dollars by bringing in tourists to admire the beauty of the views and hear versions of the history of the old South which are sometimes much too beautified. The Civil War is both long past and still very present. The first flag of the rebel slave states flies alongside the Stars and Stripes from many of Charleston's buildings. As recently as two years ago, the Southern Jack was still hoist over the state legislature. The owner of one cafe had not finished pouring my coffee before she was telling me in precise detail how her town had been burnt down by the Union general, William Sherman.</p> <p>There are reminders here that white and black Americans often lead parallel lives today. South Carolina has a large black population, but the Americans vacationing on the beaches of the upscale resort of Hilton Head were almost uniformly coloured pink.</p> <p>Very rarely did I find anyone ready to say out loud that they didn't want a black President. What I did quite often listen to were people saying that their workmates or their neighbours or America was not ready for a black President.</p> <p>Among his supporters, the thrill of the prospect of an Obama presidency rubs shoulders with a dread that he will be killed. I heard more than one prediction that he will be assassinated.</p> <p>Taking a boat out to Fort Sumter, where the first shots in the Civil War were fired, I fell into conversation with a fervently pro-Obama voter. He was white, young, a business student. 'He'll get no electoral votes here,' he sighed pessimistically. Obama's hopes of being competitive in the culturally conservative southern states depend upon mobilising many more young voters and black voters to the polls in November. But that in itself won't be enough to overcome. His biggest hurdle is those older, white Americans. The black commentator Eugene Robinson suggests that Obama's best response is to prove to them that 'he's as American as apple pie'. Sure enough, Obama, Michelle and their apple-pie nuclear family front many of the covers on the women's magazines at supermarket checkouts.</p> <p>By choosing Joe Biden as his running mate, he's gone for a seasoned senator who knows how to appeal to the working-class voters that Obama must woo. He has begun to answer the personal attacks in kind. Obama jumped on McCain with both feet when the Arizona senator claimed not to be able to remember how many homes are owned by him and his exceedingly rich wife. The answer appears to be somewhere between seven and 11.</p> <p>This has allowed Obama to flip the elitism charge back on his opponent. McCain is vastly wealthier than Obama and recently suggested that no one is rich until they are making $5m a year. Obama was brought up by a single mother, who relied for a time on food stamps, and went to school and college on scholarships and loans. McCain's senior moment about his homes allowed Obama to amplify the theme that the Republican is hopelessly out of touch with the struggle of middling Americans to pay their grocery bills and keep up with their mortgages.</p> <p>Some Democrats have wondered why it has taken Obama so long to get his teeth into his opponent. I think it is obvious why he has to be careful. For all the advantages his party enjoys this year and for all his gifts, his road to the White House is laid with dynamite. Come over as too defensive and he casts himself as the whiney victim. Come over as overly aggressive and he takes different but equal risks. First, it is not true to himself. He does thoughtful better than he does visceral, he sounds more authentic as a unifier than as a divider. One of the essentials of his candidacy is the idea that, after eight years of George W Bush, the American people have an appetite for a leader who addresses their problems with an open mind and cool intelligence.</p> <p>As he tries to calibrate how aggressive he should be, you can sense that Obama is conscious of another trap laid for him by the Republicans. They would love to provoke him in a way that would allow them to caricature him as 'the angry black man' to white America.</p> <p>We know that Obama's speech in Denver accepting the nomination will be good. The burden of expectation is such that he needs to be better than good, he needs to be brilliant. He has to do the obvious things, which are to delineate where he is different from McCain and why McCain would be no different to Bush. More essential will be presenting himself to Americans as someone with whom they can be comfortable as their President. Long and epic though this contest seems to have been, its star was absolutely unknown to many Americans less than a year ago. He is a meteor who has suddenly blazed across their sky. As he said in a recent interview: 'The American people are still checking me out.'</p> <p>Thursday's speech is his best opportunity to demolish the caricatures and convey his autobiography in a way which makes it a story that most Americans can relate to and share. If the old soldier McCain represents one version of America, Obama can speak to an even more potent definition, the America which sees itself as the country of perpetual progress, the land where men can speak of dreams and where those dreams can sometimes even come true.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday August 31 2008</strong></p> <p> In the article below, we referred to Tom Bradley's 'unsuccessful bid for the governorship of Los Angeles'. Los Angeles has a mayor, not a governor. Bradley, who was mayor from 1973 to 1993, ran unsuccessfully in 1982 and 1986 for the governorship of California. This has been corrected</p> <p> </p> <p>Standing next to his street stall of glassware in downtown Denver, Jim Butcher was delighted that Barack Obama and the Democrats were holding their convention in his city this week.</p> <p>He hoped to make a killing selling his wares to the 50,000 visitors, including 15,000 journalists, who are descending on Colorado's state capital. But Butcher, who is a registered independent, did not intend to vote for Obama in November.</p> <p>'I think, at the moment, I am going for [John] McCain,' he said. Asked if there was anything Obama could do this week to persuade him to change his mind, Butcher quickly replied: 'Not really. Not much chance of that.' </p> <p>The reason, he said, was Obama's lack of experience. When asked, he said his decision had nothing to do with the colour of the candidate's skin: 'I don't care about his race.' Then he added a rider that will dismay those who watch with mounting anxiety as McCain steadily gains ground on his Democratic rival for the White House: 'There might be some people who do.' </p> <p>This week's events in Denver are fast turning into a critical moment in Obama's bid to be America's first black President. What was once seen as an anointing of his candidacy is becoming a chance to right a campaign facing a series of unexpected crises.</p> <p>The Democrats are starting to struggle in a presidential race which they should be dominating. America is beset by economic troubles, mired in an unpopular foreign war and facing an unpopular Republican party. A stunning 80 per cent of Americans think that the country is heading in the wrong direction. Yet Obama and McCain are virtually tied in the polls. The possible explanations are multiple. The Democratic campaign is being daily assaulted by withering Republican attack ads. At the same time, there are still deep scars in the party left by the ferocious battle between Obama and Senator Hillary Clinton. </p> <p>And then there is the issue of race. It gets much less attention than the battle with Clinton, or the daily barbs traded with McCain, or Obama's struggle to rise in the polls. Yet it might provide the key to understanding the strange inability of the Obama campaign to achieve lift-off in the polls. </p> <p>'The question of this election is race. The answer we are looking for is, how much will it matter?' said Professor Shawn Bowler, a political scientist at the University of California at Riverside. America will soon find out. When Obama speaks on Thursday to more than 80,000 people in Denver's football stadium he will also reach a television audience of millions of Americans. They will look into the face of a man who could be their next President and for the first time it will be a black face. </p> <p>By the end of this week, America will finally be facing up to the question that might truly define the 2008 presidential race: is America ready to elect a black President to the White House?</p> <p>Obama's speech will take place in the most historic of circumstances. On the 45th anniversary of Martin Luther King's famous 'I have a dream speech', delivered at the height of the civil rights struggle, Obama will face an adoring crowd to whom he will preach a message of unity and change. 'It is hard to overstate the historic nature of this speech,' said Professor Seth Masket, a political scientist at Denver University. </p> <p>There is no denying Obama's campaign resembles King's lofty ideals. King spoke of a dream where '... my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the colour of their skin but by the content of their character.' Certainly, Obama has consistently portrayed himself as 'post-racial'. His bid for the presidency has avoided race unless forced to do so. That happened once, when comments made by Obama's former pastor Rev Jeremiah Wright threatened to derail his campaign. Obama responded with a well-received speech on race in Philadelphia that was an attempt to lay the issue firmly to rest.</p> <p>Afterwards, the campaign redoubled its efforts to portray Obama in the terms of America's history as a melting pot of different ethnicities: black and white, and everything in between. That is going to be writ large at Denver in a carefully packaged message. Each day has a 'theme' designed to appeal to the middle ground. They range from 'One Nation' to 'Renewing America's Promise'. At key moments, Obama's life story will be fleshed out with an emphasis on his bi-racial history, such as having a white grandfather who fought in the Second World War. During his final speech, Obama will be surrounded by 10 ordinary Americans he met during his campaign. Denver will paint an all-American picture of Obama as an everyman figure, defying pigeonholing.</p> <p>That is a laudable aim and politically astute. It is also difficult. For the fact of race is always present. It is hard to imagine the Obama phenomenon if he were a white politician. Then he might just be another one-term senator from Middle America with a gift for oratory and little experience. But Obama's mixed racial background and its deeper meaning propels him to a different level. It also makes it harder for him to avoid addressing the issue of race. </p> <p>But America itself is often engaged in the same experience; not talking about race even though everyone is thinking about it. The polls certainly seem to suggest that some white Americans do have a problem with Obama. </p> <p>His popularity is huge among blacks and strong with Hispanics and young white voters. Yet his support struggles among older white voters, including many Democrats. Among Clinton Democrats, one fifth say they are backing McCain rather than Obama. It may be these voters care about 'experience' or other issues more than black or Hispanic or young voters. Or it might be that they are simply resistant to voting for a black man to be President, whether they know it or not. Whatever the truth, securing a decent percentage of the white vote is going to be fundamental to Obama's hopes.</p> <p>In research published in New York magazine, the pollster Thom Riehle, who founded the AP/Ipsos survey, calculates that even if the black turnout were to rise by 25 per cent from 2004, with Obama gaining a 92 per cent share, and significantly more Hispanic voters and under-50s voted for Obama than voted for Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry in 2004, he would still need to win 40 per cent of the white vote - just one point less than Kerry got. As Riehle points out: 'This is a daunting task as the first black candidate for President. To get there, he's got to win roughly the same proportion of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents that all other Democrats get. If he doesn't he's in a world of trouble. He can't win it just by changing the electorate.'</p> <p>The polls themselves may be unreliable. In the past, support for African-American candidates when Americans actually cast their votes has often failed to reflect what voters told the pollsters. Most notoriously, former Mayor of Los Angeles Tom Bradley, in his unsuccessful bid for the governorship of California, came up short in a manner no one could have predicted having followed his poll ratings. American pollsters now talk about the Bradley effect.</p> <p>There is little doubt that race is going to play a starring role in this election after the convention season. 'It has not been too much of an issue so far. Or, at least not talked about. But that is not going to last,' said Bowler. It is already getting a lot of play on conservative talkshows and in books. Rush Limbaugh, the 'shock jock' who is hugely popular with white conservatives, has stepped up race-baiting on his broadcasts. He recently claimed Democrats chose Obama as a sort of 'affirmative action' programme. 'I think it really goes back to the fact that nobody had the guts to stand up and say no to a black guy,' he told his millions of listeners. Warming to his theme a few days later, he said: 'You can't criticise the little black man-child.'</p> <p>Slightly more subtly has come a series of anti-Obama books. The most strident, and most popular, has been The Obama Nation, by Jerome Corsi, who helped mastermind the Swift Boat campaign that derailed Kerry in 2004. Corsi described Obama as having Islamic links and a Muslim past. He wants him to be seen as a scary 'Other', just like some black leaders have always been portrayed. Even the title of the book has that effect: said quickly 'Obama Nation' rapidly becomes 'abomination'. That is not likely to be an accident. </p> <p>Obama frequently warns against such attacks, acknowledging they are covertly linked to his skin colour. 'What they're going to try to do is make you scared of me ... You know, he doesn't look like all those other Presidents on those dollar bills,' he told one rally. Obama is right. Nor are such attacks going to let up. Many Republican strategists believe the Wright controversy will reassert itself. Though Obama has disavowed Wright, the preacher's black nationalist theology is still going to be fodder for anti-Obama ads. They may not come from the McCain camp itself, but from shadowy groups allied to the Republican cause. Either way, the effect will be the same. </p> <p>No matter how much Obama - and millions of other Americans - seek to take race out of the election, there will be others wanting to bring it back. McCain's campaign has even accused the Obama camp itself of playing the race card, thus cleverly injecting the issue right back into the debate. </p> <p>It was a tactic that even some on Clinton's campaign sought to use. Leaked memos from her campaign revealed that her top strategist, Mark Penn, tried to get Clinton to paint Obama as un-American. 'I cannot imagine America electing a President during a time of war who is not at his centre fundamentally American in his thinking and his values,' Penn wrote in one memo. Penn is likely to have meant Obama's father's Kenyan background. But it is hard not to see some, perhaps unintentional, subtext of race. Would he have written such words if Obama's father had been Irish, and not black African?</p> <p>Clinton did not take Penn's advice, but Democrats still bear the wounds of the battle Clinton and Obama fought. That divide will be on full display in Denver. Clinton herself has been given a prime speaking slot. More controversially, so has her husband, Bill Clinton, who still damns with faint praise when it comes to Obama. Then there is the fact that Clinton's name is going to go forward in a symbolic first roll call on the convention floor. Delegates and superdelegates will be asked for their vote and estimates vary about how many will vote for Clinton. It could be as high as 1,200. This piece of political theatre was an olive branch by Obama's campaign as a way of appeasing Clinton's passionate backers. It is intended as a visible way of uniting the party. That may work. Or not.</p> <p>Larry Johnson, an intelligence consultant, runs a pro-Hillary blog. Even now, he pulls no punches when it comes to Obama. 'It is becoming clearer that he is the wrong candidate at the wrong time,' he said. </p> <p>Even if the party is healed, there are other minefields ahead in Denver. First off are the legions of protesters. They range from anti-war marchers, to environmentalists, to anti-globalisation organisations. The Denver police are also taking no chances. A complex of special holding cells - dubbed 'Gitmo on the Platte' after Denver's South Platte river - has been constructed. For a candidate desperate to ease the concerns of middle America, any violence would be a PR disaster. It would also be a moment for the Republicans to pounce and they, too, will be in Denver. Just a few blocks away from the convention hall, they have set up a media war-room, serving up stars of the Republican firmament such as Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney. Nothing, it seems, is going to be easy in Denver this week.</p> <p>The Denver convention has gone from a coronation to a challenge. 'This is tricky. He wants to leave the convention with the party as united as possible,' said Larry Haas, a political commentator and former aide in the Clinton White House. Polls last week showed Obama's lead over McCain narrowing to just a few points. One, a Reuters-Zogby survey, even had McCain with a lead of five per cent. McCain, with his new aggressive strategy, is now settled into the 'happy warrior' mode. He is the insurgent underdog taking chunks out of a more favoured opponent. Yet such an analysis is unfair to Obama. A study of the electoral coalition shows just how narrow Obama's margins of victory are. His levels of support among blacks, Hispanics and young voters are already squeezed close to their likely maximum. </p> <p>In order to win in November he undoubtedly needs to persuade white, working class and elderly Americans to back him in much greater numbers. McCain needs to keep them away. That alone will ensure that the issue of race cannot remain underground. For, in the heat of the fight ahead, it could actually become the main battlefield itself.</p>",
  "<p>\"The American dream under Bush-McCain is slipping away.\" With that, and a <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93913125\">strong speech</a> connecting the Obama-Biden ticket to the mythology of the American dream, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/20/uselections2008.barackobama\">Joe Biden for vice president era</a> began today, on the steps of the Old Capitol building in Springfield, Illinois.</p> <p>Biden - who weary Democrats found out was Barack Obama's choice for VP around 2.30am via <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jQrbykB_DTXSD7LM_SS8C9KA70ZQD92NU10G0\">text message</a> - stood on stage next to Barack Obama and made it clear that he and Obama represented the interests of the great middle class. John McCain - presumably while prancing around in his $520 Italian loafers - would represent more of Bushonomics, which emphasises the all-important need for the majority of the economic benefits in our society to trickle down into the Swiss bank accounts of those poor, overtaxed millionaire chief executives throughout the land.</p> <p>Is Biden a good pick? We'll find out on November 5. But it was a helluva beginning. For if <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2008/08/23/biden/\">Biden brings any strengths</a> to this ticket, it is most certainly his humble roots, his <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/24/us/politics/24veep.html\">foreign policy gravitas</a> and his aptitude at delivering scathing one-liners that belittle Republican politics and politicians - the latter being a skill that is lacking in too many Democrats who attempt to enter national politics. </p> <p>Biden easily delivered the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPOAKXBi9Pw\">most memorable line</a> of the presidential primaries a few months ago. Addressing Democrats during one of the debates (Biden sought the nomination before dropping out due to lack of traction), he reminded the audience that when former New York mayor and Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani spoke - a man, mind you, who has made millions off of being a 9/11 \"hero\" by virtue of being in front of the cameras that day, because he chose to place his counterterrorism headquarters in the World Trade Center, the only site previously attacked by foreign terrorists in New York - all he could manage to fit into a sentence was \"a noun, a verb and 9/11.\" </p> <p>Yes, that sound you heard was Giuliani's head snapping back from being backhanded.</p> <p>During today's speech in Springfield, Biden added another memorable line, when riffing on the recent attacks the Obama campaign has launched against the married-into-oligarchy-McCain for not knowing how many houses he has (between seven and twelve, depending upon whether individual houses on compounds count as more than one). The Delaware Democrat pointed out that while most American families sit around their kitchen table and worry about paying about the bills, McCain has to \"figure out which of his seven kitchen tables to sit at.\"</p> <p>Although, in McCain's defense, it must be tough to think about your houses when your $270,000 per-year worth of butlers and maids are demanding their paychecks. But I digress.</p> <p>In the end, Biden will have to use his humble background, policy expertise and attack-ready soundbites to overcome the fact that he has a tendency to <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5ixgPBGhWRlq7LsZ4jWZZyo7KXewgD92O6OQ01\">stick his foot in his mouth</a> now and again, not to mention the fact that he has been in Washington - although commuting homes every night to Wilmington, Delaware on the train - since all the way back when McCain was still middle aged. </p> <p>Will this be a problem? Again, we don't yet know. But what I do know, is that with Biden aboard the Obama Express, it's going to be a fun ride.</p>",
  "<p>So Barack Obama, the candidate of hope and change, has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/23/barackobama.joebiden\">selected as his running mate</a> an old, straight white guy who's been in the Senate for 36 years? Says my friend <a href=\"http://www.waveflux.net/archives/obama-biden-er-feel-it/\">Phil Barron</a>: \"Disappointed, change agents? Well, if you had a revolution every day, it wouldn't be special, would it?\" And who can argue with that?</p> <p>It's certainly a curious choice, given that Biden's support of the credit card industry-lobbied bankruptcy bill is exactly the sort of thing from which voters fed up with insider politics want, uh, change. And it will definitely be interesting to see just how much integrity there is among the progressives who refused to support Hillary Clinton because of her support for the Iraq invasion, now that Obama's gone and picked one of its (former) cheerleaders as his running mate.</p> <p>The case against Biden was \u2026 vast. The 65-year-old would leave a power vacuum at the top of the Democratic party after a two-term Obama presidency, leaving the Dems in the same spot in which the GOP found themselves this election. Biden was accused of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/23/joebiden.uselections2008\">plagiarising a speech</a> during his 1988 presidential run, leading to further revelations about plagiarism and \"misstatements\" regarding his education, all of which plays into one of the Republicans' favourite accusations to launch against Dems \u2013 that of the serial exaggerator, which was successfully used against Al Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton. (His reversal on the Iraq War plays into another, successfully used against John Kerry \u2013 that of the flip-flopper.) Biden's also a serial gaffe machine, who <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/01/us/politics/01biden.html?ex=1327986000&amp;en=83049af649fc7028&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss\">launched his own 2008 presidential bid</a> with a screeching dog whistle that declared Obama \"the first mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy.\"</p> <p>It's not the first time Biden's had problems with saying something <a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2007/10/quote-of-day_25.html\">racist</a>, and he's no stranger to <a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2005/11/what-joker.html\">sexist</a> commentary, either \u2013 which is only the beginning of his problems with women, on whose behalf he is decidedly inconsistent.</p> <p>Although he authored the landmark Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) of 1994 - a key tool in addressing domestic abuse nationally, which delegates federal funds for combating crimes against women - he <a href=\"http://www.ontheissues.org/Senate/Joe_Biden.htm\">does not support</a> federal funding for abortion on the premise that it \"imposes a view.\" (That view being, presumably, that women have agency over their own bodies.) Last year, he supported the \"partial-birth abortion\" ban, even without exceptions for the health or life of the mother, but also voted to reintroduce the Equal Rights Amendment.</p> <p>His overall voting record is fairly described as pro-choice and favorable to women, although he has disappointed in crunch times, most notably <a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2005/11/here-it-is-in-black-and-white.html\">recommending against</a> a filibuster against then-Supreme Court justice candidate Samuel Alito, who found no constitutional right to abortion, and, in 1991, as the then-Senate Judiciary Committee chairman the Clarence Thomas nomination hearing, in which he was widely regarded as failing Anita Hill, and <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2001-02-01-hill.htm\">later admitted</a> he thought she had been lying, at least in part. </p> <p>In the end, while his record isn't abysmal, it's also not the sort of record that's going to win over progressive women who are mistrustful of Obama as a result of his <a href=\"http://www.feministe.us/blog/archives/2008/02/28/words-mean-things-part-2/\">worrying</a> <a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2008/07/blog-post.html\">rhetoric</a> on <a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2008/07/barack-obama-i-didnt-say-what-i-said.html\">reproductive</a> <a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2008/07/putting-obama-comments-on-third-term.html\">rights</a> and his failure to lead (or even significantly comment) on <a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2008/08/hhs-rule-change-update.html\">major issues</a> affecting American women. Biden not only doesn't help Obama with this constituency but will potentially hurt him.</p> <p>The case for Biden is, of course, that's he's experienced and strong on foreign policy \u2013 though the flipside of that argument is that selecting Biden plays directly into the narrative that Obama is inexperienced. (McCain is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDVUPqoowf8\">already all over</a> Biden's previous comments that Obama is not ready to lead, but McCain is.) It also undermines the \"change\" rhetoric on which Obama has founded his campaign; a double-bill of senators, one of whom has now lived longer as a sitting senator than he did not as one, is hardly the picture of a political insurgency.</p> <p>Given all of the above, one can only assume that Obama and Biden have some kind of dynamic relationship that makes Biden a great personal asset to Obama. (Or, perhaps, that Biden's got pictures of Obama in a compromising position with a goat.) It's tough to see how this choice was a winner \u2013 even the stage management of the announcement, the furious crescendo leading up to the middle-of-the-night reveal of a yawningly expectable Beltway fixture, was designed to create maximum disappointment. Mannion <a href=\"http://lancemannion.typepad.com/lance_mannion/2008/08/but-dick-cheney.html \">describes it</a> as expecting a pony for your birthday and getting a new winter coat \u2013 and that sounds about right.</p> <p>Biden's functional (at best). And maybe he even seems exciting to someone who needs a new winter coat.</p> <p>Of course, there are a lot of places in America where it never gets cold.</p>",
  "<p>I have always felt a quasi-spiritual connection with Joe Biden, Barack Obama's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/23/barackobama.joebiden\">choice</a> as running mate. Google \"<a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=plagiarism+biden&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta\">plagiarism</a>\" and the poor Senator from Delaware always comes near the top of the search. As a former speechwriter for <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3965853.stm\">Neil Kinnock</a> it gives me a warm glow that Neil's political career gets a much deserved resurrection and run around the houses every time Biden's past is raked up. I did not produce <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/uselection2008/barackobama/2607505/Joe-Biden-plagiarised-Neil-Kinnock-speech.html\">the immortal words that Biden borrowed</a>, but, fittingly for my views on how Democratic primaries are a long drawn-out form of <em>seppuku</em>, it was an aide to his Democratic rival Michael Dukakis who incited the media feeding-frenzy by revealing Biden's highly inappropriate lifting, not only of Neil's words, but his biography as well.</p> <p>And you have to admire someone like Biden who <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE5D61139F930A25752C0A96E948260&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/P/Plagiarism\">presented Kinnock with a book of his Senate speeches</a> when he visited the House of Commons the following year. A sense of humour is rare in American politics, and Biden has one. How else could he have survived all those long decades on Capitol Hill?</p> <p>He shares another oratorical characteristic with the former Labour leader, which is an inability to put a firm and terminal full-stop (or a period, in the US) at the end of his discourses.</p> <p>Biden's long foreign policy experience and interest certainly meets Obama's alleged deficiencies in that field. In reality of course Obama is not so deficient compared with John McCain, so it is a bad sign that he may be appointing a real VP to beat a spurious shortcoming.</p> <p>However, Biden and Obama seem to be on similar lines with the need to engage in diplomacy before sending in the gunboats. And read the conservative blogosphere on Biden as a creature of the UN \u2013 he even got married in the Methodist chapel at the UN - and you begin to think that he may have something going for him on the multilateral front.</p> <p>Biden was pandering to Aipac long before Obama stepped to the podium to promise the world to the lobby, but is still on the more pragmatic side compared with McCain's \"coalition of the yelling\" on the issue.</p> <p>And one presumes it was Biden's tendency to lean towards the Israel lobby which inclined him to support the Iraq war, which he did with some enthusiasm, even though he now regrets it. Certainly, having a son about to be deployed to Iraq puts him in a distinct minority among American politicians.</p> <p>Biden also supports the embargo on Cuba, which has been Fidel's best excuse for mismanaging the island for all these decades. That sits uneasily with his call to engage constructively with China, the number one proponent of the death penalty, which Biden, to his credit, opposes. In fact, his position is remarkably close to Clinton's on this.</p> <p>Similarly while one can admire the humanitarian fervor with which he insists that something must be done about Darfur, his favoured solution was to send US troops there. That would be as disastrous as it is impracticable. Quite apart from the question of where the troops would come from, it betrays a lack of appreciation of just how deep in the toilet the US's reputation is globally, let alone in the Arab world.</p> <p>Clearly Biden may need some help. Nine years or so ago I was taken to lunch by a veteran Republican who asked how I would like to write speeches for George Bush. I replied that if Bush wanted speeches written advocating universal healthcare and a greater role for the UN, he could have them. I did not get the call. Neil Kinnock is now busy heading the British Council, but I am prepared to substitute. Joe, just drop me a line. But please, follow the script.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama's decision to make Joe Biden his running mate has divided opinion among commentators.</p> <p>Many regarded the Delaware senator as an obvious choice following the focus on world issues brought about by the conflict in Georgia.</p> <p>His appointment has been backed by the Virginia governor, Tim Kaine, who was also in the running for the vice-presidential nomination.</p> <p>\"I am very excited that Senator Obama has selected Senator Biden to be his running mate,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Senator Biden is a tremendous leader and a great complement to Senator Obama and his candidacy. </p> <p>\"He has worked as a committed public servant, has a proven track record and understands the complex challenges facing our nation.\"</p> <p>The Huffington Post <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/earl-ofari-hutchinson/mccain-not-obama-picked-v_b_120779.html\">commented</a> that \"McCain, not Obama, picked VP Biden\".</p> <p>It said Biden's foreign policy expertise made him Obama's obvious choice after the Democratic campaign was criticised by McCain as being \"inexperienced and naive\" on overseas issues.</p> <p>\"McCain repeated the points about Obama, mantra-like,\" it said. \"He was too untested on foreign policy issues, and too inexperienced and green to fight the terrorism battle and to be hard nosed enough on national security.\" </p> <p>The US news website TwinCities.com <a href=\"http://www.twincities.com/politics/ci_10280818\">warned</a> that \"Biden's own worst enemy may be his own record\", referring to his comments last year that Obama was \"not ready\" to be president. </p> <p>The article said Biden had accepted $5,133,072 in contributions from lawyers and lobbyists since 2003, whereas Obama does not accept contributions from federally registered lobbyists. </p> <p>It also highlighted Biden's close ties with credit card companies as a topic ripe for attack by the McCain camp.</p> <p>Juan Cole, president of the Global Americana Institute, <a href=\"http://www.juancole.com/2008/08/biden-as-vp-candidate.html\">congratulated the senator on his appointment</a>, saying he had been impressed by Biden's grasp of Middle Eastern politics. </p> <p>Responding to those who have pointed out Biden's tendency to commit verbal gaffes, Cole said: \"We have had a president for nearly eight years who has committed almost nothing but gaffes, every day, all day. </p> <p>\"The corporate media typically forgive Bush for this and don't even often bring it up. Why is it that it is an issue for Biden but not for Bush?\"</p> <p>The BBC blogger Justin Webb <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/justinwebb/2008/08/biden_a_necessary_antidote.html\">put the choice of Biden down to the recent focus on Georgia</a>. </p> <p>\"Joe Biden is Vladimir Putin's contribution to American politics - he is a necessary antidote to the Obama lack of worldly wisdom,\" he wrote.</p> <p>John Boehner, Republican leader in the House of Representatives, said: <br>\"Americans looking for a pair of candidates who are ready to fix a broken Washington aren't going to find them on the Obama/Biden ticket. In Joe Biden, Barack Obama has not only found a running mate who doesn't believe he's ready to be president, he's proven his opposition to an 'All of the Above' energy reform strategy to lower fuel costs for families and small businesses.\" </p> <p>But Dick Lugar, the senior Republican on the Senate's foreign relations committee, said: \"I congratulate Senator Barack Obama on his selection of my friend, Senator Joe Biden, to be his vice-presidential running mate. I have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with Joe Biden to bring strong bipartisan support to United States foreign policy.\" </p> <p>The Leftcoaster <a href=\"http://www.theleftcoaster.com/archives/013038.php\">has voiced its support for Biden</a> as someone who can fill in the gaps in the Democratic campaign. </p> <p>\"Biden brings experience, feistiness and boatloads of foreign policy seasoning that Obama sorely lacks, and Biden knows more about sensible foreign policy than McCain, Tom Ridge, Tim Pawlenty, or Mitt Romney will ever know themselves.\"</p> <p>Rick Klein, a political analyst at ABC News, said Biden <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Vote2008/story?id=5637409&amp;page=1\">will be the \"experienced yet still energetic inside player\"</a> to Obama's \"fresh-faced voice of change\".</p> <p>However, he warned that \"picking Biden also sends a stark signal that the Obama campaign is worried that the presidential nominee is in danger of flunking the commander in chief test\".</p> <p>The 65-year-old's appointment as vice-presidential nominee has knocked Obama's popularity, according to bookmakers. </p> <p>Following the latest polling data, the bookies have lengthened Obama's odds on replacing George Bush from 4/9 to 1/2. McCain has been shortened to 6/4 from 7/4. </p> <p>\"It is not looking as good it was for Obama,\" the Ladbrokes spokesman Robin Hutchison said. \"At this point, we still expect him to win - but it could be a much tighter race.\"</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-336909636\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>Barack Obama ended days of speculation about his choice of running mate today, sending out an early morning message to supporters saying he had picked Joe Biden.</p> <p>Biden, 65, is the man seen as the Democrats' authority on foreign affairs.</p> <p>The voluble chair of the Senate foreign relations committee will appear with Obama for the first time later today in Springfield, Illinois, where the Democratic candidate began his run for the White House early last year.</p> <p>The pair will then set off on a lightning tour of battleground states, hoping to build up excitement about the ticket before they arrive at the Democratic convention in Denver, which gets under way on Monday.</p> <p>The choice of Biden was widely seen today as a sign that the Obama camp considered foreign policy would be an issue in the coming election against the Republican, John McCain, and that Obama could suffer from charges of inexperience.</p> <p>Unlike earlier vice presidential candidates, Biden can not deliver a key battleground state: he comes from tiny Delaware. </p> <p>After 35 years as a senator, he cannot easily deliver Obama's message of change and \u2013 perhaps most crucially \u2013 voted for the Iraq war.</p> <p>Biden could also be haunted by attacks he made on Obama earlier this year, and his plagiarism of a speech by Neil Kinnock 20 years ago, but his knowledge of national security and foreign policy apparently overrode those considerations.</p> <p>The Obama camp said as much on its website, with a message reading: \"Joe Biden brings extensive foreign policy experience, an impressive record of collaborating across party lines, and a direct approach to getting the job done.\"</p> <p>Biden reinforced his image as a wise man on foreign affairs with a trip to Georgia a week ago. </p> <p>That intervention seems to have made him the firm favourite for vice-president, elevating him from a familiar figure in Washington -where he was a regular guest on television chat shows and think tank forums - to an indispensable counsellor. </p> <p>Despite Biden's ubiquity in Washington, the Obama extracted the maximum drama with the timing of its announcement, keeping the choice under wraps until late on Friday night.</p> <p>Then, the other top contenders, Tim Kaine, the governor of Virginia, and the Indiana senator Evan Bayh told reporters they would not be chosen.</p> <p>The official campaign email announcing Biden as the vice presidential pick did not go out until around 3am.</p> <p>The timing of the decision allows Obama to go into the Democratic convention on a high, rebounding from weeks of being battered by the McCain campaign as a mere celebrity figure unfit for the White House. </p> <p>Obama had a few days' grace when McCain acknowledged he could not keep track of how many houses he owned with his beer heiress wife, Cindy.</p> <p>But the Democrats are mindful that he has been on a slow downward slide in the polls all summer, in part because of the McCain attacks. The choice of Biden, with his long record, could reassure voters about Obama.</p> <p>Biden brings other gifts as a campaigner. He is combative as well as a smooth talker \u2013 a combination that could serve him well in the traditional vice-presidential role as attacker. </p> <p>He can also claim working class roots and is Catholic, which could help win over two core demographics that have so far been lukewarm to Obama.</p> <p>He is known for regularly returning by train to his native Delaware rather than spending time in Washington. One of his sons, the attorney general for Delaware, is about to be deployed to Iraq in the state national guard.</p> <p>Biden could also be an asset in trying to unite the party around Obama after the long and bruising primary battle. </p> <p>He claims credit for passing legislation against domestic violence and is firm in his support of abortion, factors that might help bring support from female Democrats.</p> <p>In an obviously co-ordinated effort, Clinton sent out an email early today praising Biden as an \"exceptionally strong, experienced leader and devoted public servant\".<br> Biden has personal understanding of what it means to be a young rising star in Washington. He was first elected to the Senate at the age of 29 as a change agent. </p> <p>Even so, he is not an entirely natural choice for a campaign predicated on change, and which has operated for more than a year as an extremely disciplined machine.</p> <p>Biden's friendliness to reporters \u2013 and his occasional use of strong language \u2013 could make for an uneasy fit with the Obama campaign's rigour about preventing leaks and staying on message.</p> <p>Quick talking has embarrassed Biden in the past. Earlier this year, when he and Obama were rivals in the race for the White House, Biden once described Obama as the \"first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy\".</p> <p>Biden dropped out after the first contest in Iowa, having struggled to raise funds from gain supporters against the combined star power of Obama and Clinton. He remained neutral until the end of the primaries, unlike other candidates.</p> <p>But in the heat of the contest, Biden regularly attacked Obama for his lack of experience \u2013 comments that immediately resurfaced in Republican attack ads today. \"I would be honored to run with or against John McCain, because I think the country would be better off,\" Biden says in the old footage.</p> <p>Biden also has baggage from his first run for the White House. </p> <p>In 1988, he was forced to drop out of the race for the Democratic nomination after it was revealed he had plagiarised a famous speech by Kinnock in which he talked about how he had been the first in his family to go to university.</p>",
  "<p>The Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama today named the veteran politician Joe Biden as his running mate, his campaign confirmed. </p> <p>Biden's credentials as the chair of the Senate's foreign relations committee are expected to help Obama's campaign challenge claims of a lack of foreign policy experience. </p> <p>However, critics say choosing the 65-year-old Delaware senator, who has three decades of experience in Washington, goes against Obama's pledge of change in the White House.</p> <p>The decision was announced on Obama's <a href=\"http://www.barackobama.com/\">website</a>, which carried the message: \"Barack has chosen Joe Biden to be his running mate. </p> <p>\"Joe Biden brings extensive foreign policy experience, an impressive record of collaborating across party lines and a direct approach to getting the job done.\"</p> <p>The announcement was confirmed in a text message to supporters following two months of fevered speculation.</p> <p>Later, Hillary Clinton, who was beaten by Obama in an often-bitter primary season, said: \"In naming my colleague and friend Senator Joe Biden to be the vice presidential nominee, Senator Obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong, experienced leader and devoted public servant.\" </p> <p>The former first lady went on: \"Senator Biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help Senator Obama both win the presidency and govern this great country.\" </p> <p>Earlier this week, before naming his running mate, Obama said he had chosen someone who would be able to help him govern and would offer independent advice.</p> <p>Biden had been considered the frontrunner for the job in recent weeks, a position confirmed by a last-minute and unscheduled trip to meet the president of Georgia last weekend.</p> <p>The country's conflict with Russia has seen international issues return to the forefront of the campaign battleground.</p> <p>Biden has led strong attacks on John McCain's Republican foreign policy approach for its support of George Bush in focusing on Iraq.</p> <p>He will make his first speech as the vice-presidential nominee at the Democratic party's national convention in Denver, Colorado, next week.</p> <p>The other potential vice presidential nominees included Tim Kaine, the governor of the swing state of Virginia, and Evan Bayh, the Indiana senator who it was thought would help Obama shore up support in the midwest.</p> <p>McCain is expected to name his vice presidential nominee next week. The Minnesota governor, Tim Pawlenty, and the former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney are reportedly among those being considered.</p> <p>However, the choice of a running mate is not likely to swing the elections.</p> <p>Biden is known for being talkative and is prone to making statements which get him in to trouble. </p> <p>Last year, as a Democratic presidential hopeful, he said Obama was \"not yet ready\" for the presidency - a remark that will be seized upon by the Republican attack machine prior to the November 4 election. </p> <p>Even before Obama confirmed Biden's selection, McCain campaign spokesman Ben Porritt said: \"There has been no harsher critic of Barack Obama's lack of experience than Joe Biden.</p> <p>\"Biden has denounced Barack Obama's poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what Americans are quickly realising - that Barack Obama is not ready to be president.\"</p> <p>Biden, who dropped out of the presidential race in Iowa in January, is of Irish Catholic heritage but is in favour of abortion rights, a key issue in US elections.</p>",
  "<p>In a monstrous violation of the laws of modern politics, the Obama campaign appears to have chosen, in Joe Biden, a vice-presidential candidate whose public pronouncements are occasionally actually amusing, and sometimes actually reflect what he's thinking. Naturally, this could prove ruinous \u2014 already this morning the Republicans are <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/aug/23/uselections2008.barackobama\">all over</a> the Biden archive. The Obama campaign's best hope is probably that Biden has been so loose-tongued for so long that individual gaffes won't matter; it will all just seem like an appealing character trait. And of course to anyone not involved in the day-to-day control-freakery of political campaigns, it <em>is</em> an appealing character trait. For starters, here's a moment (<a href=\"http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=08&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=veepstakes_the_case_for_biden\">via Ezra Klein</a>) in which a mere facial expression from Biden, right at the end of this clip, tells you all you need to know about Rudy Giuliani's foreign-policy credentials:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/p7Y8AFctpjo?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <object width=\"460\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/p7Y8AFctpjo&color1=291787617&color2=325161297&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/p7Y8AFctpjo&color1=291787617&color2=325161297&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" wmode=\"transparent\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object> </figure>   <p>Some of the most serious criticisms of Biden's personal conduct have to do with his track record of borrowing speeches and \"mis-speaking\" about his past, but in <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4D91F3CF931A1575AC0A961948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print\">this New York Times piece</a> \u2014 in which he apologises for claiming to have three degrees, when he only has two \u2014 the stand-out moment comes when he tells a voter in New Hampshire:</p> <blockquote> <p>I think I have a much higher IQ than you do.</p> </blockquote> <p>...which is surely the definition of a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsley_gaffe\">Kinsley gaffe</a>. </p> <p>Sarcasm's not beneath him, either, as this press release from the primaries shows (via <a href=\" http://marcambinder.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/08/more_republican_oppo_on_biden.php\">Marc Ambinder</a>):</p> <blockquote> <p>The Biden for President Campaign today congratulated Sen. Barack Obama for arriving at a number of Sen. Biden's long-held views on combating al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan.</p> </blockquote> <p>Then there's this famous and rather excruciating moment, in which Biden, speaking with an Indian-American supporter, says: \"In Delaware, the largest growth in population is Indian-Americans moving from India. You cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent. I'm not joking.\" Biden's intent is surely not racist here: his tone of voice, and choice of interlocutor, suggest he's celebrating Delaware diversity in a drily humourous way. (\"I'm not joking\" is Biden-speak for \"I am joking.\") But still, talk about a gift to your critics:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OIT3jUrNTX0?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <object width=\"460\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/OIT3jUrNTX0&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/OIT3jUrNTX0&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object> </figure>   <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=91157&amp;title=sen.-joe-biden\">this Daily Show interview</a>, in which Jon Stewart confronts Biden with some of his more infelicitous remarks, is worth watching in full.</p> <p>And if you can make it out \u2014 the sound quality is poor \u2014 here's a moment from 2007 in which Biden tells a supporter how he'll respond when Bush tries to a veto an Iraq spending bill that would set a timetable for troop withdrawal:</p> <blockquote> <p>We're going to shove it down his throat.</p> </blockquote> <p>(There are <a href=\"http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NGRhNzJlMWY5NjdiNzhjMTRkYjMzNjYwOGJmYzNjMTY=\" \">plenty, plenty more</a> potentially damaging Biden quotes, and we'll be hearing a lot of them from the McCain campaign in the coming days.)</p> <p>So how will all this affect the outcome of the election? As a general rule, remember: when a candidate strikes liberal journalists and commie Europeans as witty, sardonic, clever and engaging, that's always a <em>really, really good sign</em> of his electability in mainstream America.</p>",
  "<p>Well, that was a little more suspense than a comfortable old shoe like <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/24/us/politics/24biden.html\">Joe Biden</a> merited, don't you think? It's been clear for what, three weeks now that Barack Obama's choice had basically narrowed to Biden and Evan Bayh, with several others having an outside shot. That being the case, I do wonder what took so long. </p> <p>One of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/20/uselections2008.barackobama\">the qualities for which Biden is known</a> and presumably for which he was chosen is that he's not afraid of Republican attacks and is willing to answer them in kind. Given that the last three weeks consisted of nothing but Republican attacks, it would have been awfully handy to have had Biden around to answer them.</p> <p>But we are where we are. A good choice? Sure. At least, not a bad one. The primary rule of vice-presidential selection is \"first, do no harm,\" and that rule was not violated. Virginia Governor Tim Kaine is the only one of the finalists who would have been a bad one. Kaine has less experience in government than Obama, and an Obama-Kaine ticket would have handed the GOP a line of attack on a platter.</p> <p>Biden is steady. He acquitted himself well in his brief presidential run. The run flamed out quickly, but even so, he did well in debates, he seemed intelligent and witty (and he is in fact both of those things) and he got off some nice zingers, like that line about every sentence uttered by Rudy Giuliani consisting of \"subject, verb, 9-11.\" </p> <p>Biden can say of his old friend John McCain, in a way most other pols can't, something like, \"Just because John served five years in POW camp doesn't mean he understands healthcare policy better than the rest of us, and he doesn't.\"</p> <p>Since it apparently came down to Biden and Indiana's Evan Bayh, let's tote up what Biden brings to the dance that Bayh did not, and vice versa.</p> <p>1. Biden has genuine foreign-policy heft. If not selected for veep, he'd have made a great secretary of state (a job I'm dead certain he'd rather have had). So he reassures in this crucial area. And even though he voted for the Iraq war, he's canceled that vote out a few times over with stinging criticisms of the war and the Bush gang.</p> <p>2. Biden is Catholic. Obama had big trouble with northern Catholics in the primaries. For that constituency, Biden is among the best surrogates the Democrats have at their disposal.</p> <p>3. Old people adore him. I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/aug/19/uselections2008.barackobama\">blogged about this</a> the other day. They are another constituency with which Obama has issues, and they love Biden.</p> <p>4. He brings no important state with him but has natural geographic reach into two key states. Biden's state of Delaware borders Pennsylvania, and Pennsylvania borders Ohio. Biden can go into those two states and promote Obama to voters who'll find his way of talking roughly familiar. </p> <p>5. Biden is good on the attack. As noted above. He has the standing to go toe-to-toe with McCain. He never served in the military. He was already a college graduate by the time the US government started drafting young men for Vietnam in 1965, so one assumes there's no scandal there. But he nevertheless, through his longtime membership on the Senate foreign relations committee, has grown comfortable among men in uniform. He can answer McCain back on military and foreign-policy issues, and he will.</p> <p>That's a pretty good list in his behalf. But Bayh brought four important things that Obama may have sacrificed now in eschewing him:</p> <p>1. Bayh's state of Indiana. I think an Obama-Bayh ticket could have won Indiana and its 13 electoral votes, which is a lot of votes. I'm not sure Obama-Biden can.</p> <p>2. Bayh would have had more credibility with independents. One thing about Biden that should be worrisome to Democrats is that his appeal is largely, maybe solely, to other Democrats. Bayh would have signaled to independents and moderate Republicans that there was substance behind Obama's post-partisan rhetoric.</p> <p>3. Bayh was a major Hillary Clinton supporter. His selection would have helped mend that fence, which is still full of gaping holes. </p> <p>4. Bayh has a Norman Rockwell family. A blond wife and two cute-looking 13-year-old twin boys. Put them up on a stage with the Obama family. You get the picture.</p> <p>So, by my count, the scale tips slightly in favor of Biden. It's also the case that if Bayh had been the choice, the leaders of the liberal blogosphere would have been reaching for their pikes and Phrygian caps. They can't stand the guy. As for me, I will keep thinking about those 13 electoral votes until Biden gives me a few reasons not to think about them.</p> <p>And finally: oh, yeah\u2014governing! We tend to forget that the campaign will last about another 75 days, while, if they win, Obama and Biden might govern for nearly 10 times that number of days. On this score, Biden is solid. Obama said he didn't want a \"yes man,\" and Biden surely won't be that.</p> <p>All in all, wholly acceptable choice and glad that's over with. Let's get back to the campaign.</p>",

  "<p><strong>Joe Biden</strong></p> <p>The 65-year-old Delaware senator has, by all accounts, a superlative resum\u00e9. </p> <p>His leadership of the foreign relations committee would benefit Democrats during a presidential race that could be decided as much by Iran, Iraq, and Russia as by the US. </p> <p>Biden is a demonstrably skilled debater, his son is scheduled for a deployment to Iraq this year, and he has a palpable affection for Obama.</p> <p>Washington has produced few sparkling wits, but Biden is one of them. Only this veteran senator, first elected at the age of 30, could get a laugh just by saying: \"Yes.\" During a Democratic presidential debate in February, the famously talkative Pennsylvania native was asked whether he had the self-discipline to lead the free world, most expected one of his long-winded answers.</p> <p>But he shocked the crowd into laughter by answering: \"Yes.\" That demonstrated the self-discipline that, according to his critics, his loquaciousness undercuts.</p> <p>His drawbacks, however, go beyond his verbosity. His presidential candidacy in 1988 derailed after he admitted to plagiarising a speech by the then British Labour party leader, Neil Kinnock. </p> <p>And his long history in Washington risks undermining Obama's message of \"change\".</p> <p><strong>The other contenders:</strong></p> <p><strong>Tim Kaine</strong></p> <p>Kaine and Obama have a lot in common. Both have climbed the political ladder at an early age, spent formative years of their lives in foreign countries \u2013 and, perhaps most importantly, proven they can win over historical Republican voters.</p> <p>Kaine, 50, was elected governor of Virginia in 2005 on a solidly centrist platform that emphasised balanced budgets. </p> <p>He personally opposes capital punishment, but appealed to the state's conservative culture by promising to permit executions there.</p> <p>His bond with Obama began before he was even elected, when he invited the young senator from Illinois to campaign with him. </p> <p>The two and their wives are all graduates of Harvard law school, and Kaine's past service as a missionary in Honduras aligns him with Obama's experience of life outside the US.</p> <p>Kaine's lack of national security or foreign policy credentials has, however, already drawn fire from Republicans who anticipate his selection as the vice-presidential nominee. </p> <p>No less an arbiter of attack politics than Karl Rove maligned the Virginian as \"undistinguished\" last week, mocking his term as \"mayor of the 105th largest city in America\" (Kaine was mayor of the Virginia state capital, Richmond, from 1998 to 2000).</p> <p>But those who believe running mates can help deliver US states to a presidential candidate have often promoted Kaine, citing Obama's potential to win Virginia for a Democratic presidential candidate for the first time since 1964.</p> <p><strong>Evan Bayh</strong></p> <p>Evan Bayh is a senator for Indiana, the state his father represented in Washington for 18 years and that elected him governor at the age of 33.</p> <p>His support for the Iraq war, tax cuts and government surveillance has frustrated some liberals, who worry that his centrism would undermine the party's agenda.</p> <p>However, the 52-year-old defies easy characterisation. Although he bolstered the Bush administration's case for war, he began calling for the resignation of the then defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld less than a year after the Iraq invasion. </p> <p>While he supported the controversial Patriot Act, he voted to reject Bush appointments for attorney general and the supreme court, as well as that for the secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice.</p> <p>Bayh's worth to Obama is undeniable. As an early backer of Hillary Clinton's candidacy this year, his choice as vice-president would help mollify her frustrated supporters. He is a proponent of strong sanctions on Iran, which would help Obama erase lingering concerns among hawkish Jewish voters.</p> <p>His mild-mannered personality makes him the polar opposite of the gregarious Biden. Counterintuitively, the biggest advantage Bayh brings may be his relatively unexciting image. </p> <p>His personal life holds no promise of buried scandal, and his solid senate record on almost all the key issues at play in this year's election could be just what Democrats need.</p> <p><strong>Kathleen Sebelius</strong></p> <p>The popular Kansas governor, like Kaine, would help Obama win votes in a traditionally conservative state. </p> <p>The 60-year-old has worked well with Republicans without giving ground on her support for abortion rights and gun control.</p> <p>However, nobody can say for certain whether Obama would gain a decisive advantage with women by choosing a female running mate \u2013 especially one without the surname Clinton. </p> <p>And while Sebelius's low-key style helps her bond with political opponents, her easygoing rebuttal to George Bush's state of the union speech this year left many Democratic activists unimpressed.</p> <p>Obama and Sebelius have displayed a personal bond on the campaign trail, and his family's roots in Kansas could help the pair craft a powerful narrative to appeal to the US heartland. </p> <p>Nevertheless, Sebelius holds more obvious risks as a running mate than the three white males also considered finalists for the vice-presidency.</p> <p><strong>Chet Edwards</strong></p> <p>Chet Edwards, a nine-term congressman from Texas, has attracted less buzz but enjoys the backing of one of the most powerful politicians in the US. </p> <p>\"I hope he will be the nominee,\" the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, told ABC television earlier this month. \"I just wanted people to be aware of the extraordinary credentials of Chet Edwards.\" </p> <p>The congressman said he had been vetted for a place on the ticket.</p>",
  "<p>In US popular mythology, presidential running mates tend to be viewed as the ultimate accessory. </p> <p>At best, aspiring vice presidents flatter the candidate's strengths and lend extra panache. However, the wrong choice can leave voters wondering: \"What was he thinking?\"</p> <p>Not every running mate bemoaned the post as \"the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived\", as John Adams put it, or worse than \"a pitcher of warm piss\" in the famous words of Franklin D Roosevelt's vice-president, John Nance Garner.</p> <p>In fact, some vice presidents have gone down in US history as more politically skilful than the commanders in chief they served under. </p> <p>Richard Nixon led cabinet meetings on behalf of president Dwight Eisenhower, while Lyndon Johnson boasted legislative savvy that the younger John F Kennedy could not match.</p> <p>Then there is Dick Cheney, whose unprecedented control over decision-making in George Bush's White House gives liberals worldwide the jitters. </p> <p>But where does Cheney rank in the canon?

His downright scary demeanour also humanises Bush, who likes to call him Darth Vader.<br><strong>Flaws:</strong> Almost universally despised by liberals; accidentally shot a friend in the face during a hunting trip.</p> <h2>The worst five</h2> <p><strong>1) Aaron Burr</strong><br><strong>Presidential partner:</strong> Thomas Jefferson<br><strong>His fatal problems: </strong> Burr was so angry with Alexander Hamilton for orchestrating Jefferson's narrow victory \u2013 thus dooming him to the vice presidency \u2013 that he was dropped from the ticket in 1804. Burr promptly challenged Hamilton to a duel and killed him.<br><strong>Redeeming quality: </strong> Helped popularise the phrase \"pistols at dawn\".</p> <p><strong>2) Spiro Agnew</strong><br><strong>Presidential partner:</strong> Richard Nixon<br><strong>His fatal problems: </strong> Agnew was hailed as a regional balancer, giving Nixon an advantage in the south, but their relationship turned sour. The president all but abandoned Agnew and helped force him from office after he was charged with tax evasion and money laundering.<br><strong>Redeeming quality: </strong> Became a target of good satire on TV shows The Simpsons, Angel, and The Wonder Years.</p> <p><strong>3) Dan Quayle</strong><br><strong>Presidential partner:</strong> George HW Bush<br><strong>His fatal problems: </strong> Quayle's penchant for gaffes became a national punchline, particularly his insistence at a grammar school spelling bee that \"potatoe\" was a word and his decision to blame rising urban violence on popular TV character Murphy Brown, a single mother.<br><strong>Redeeming quality: </strong> Made an excellent Doonesbury character.</p> <p><strong>4) John Tyler</strong><br><strong>Presidential partner:</strong> William Henry Harrison<br><strong>His fatal problems: </strong> When Harrison suddenly died days after taking office, leaving the White House to Tyler, his potential seemed great. But the lanky vice-president proved a poor diplomat, earning him the nickname \"His Accidency\" and expulsion from his own party.<br><strong>Redeeming quality: </strong> Successfully annexed Texas.</p> <p><strong>5) Hannibal Hamlin</strong><br><strong>Presidential partner:</strong> Abraham Lincoln<br><strong>His fatal problems: </strong> Hamlin's choice to lead the Union army during the US civil war ended up losing badly and he was perennially eclipsed by the iconic president. Things got so bad that Lincoln jettisoned Hamlin in 1864 in favour of Andrew Johnson \u2013 who was later impeached.<br><strong>Redeeming quality: </strong> Marvellously alliterative name.</p>"
