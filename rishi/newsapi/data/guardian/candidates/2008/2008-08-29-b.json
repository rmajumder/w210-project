  "<p>Russia bitterly accused the west of bias and double standards yesterday, following international criticism of its actions in Georgia, and amid signs that the European Union is backing away from sanctions against Moscow.</p> <p>Russia's foreign ministry said it rejected criticism from the G7 group of industrialised countries. They condemned its invasion of Georgia, and its recognition on Tuesday of South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent. </p> <p>\"This step is biased and aimed at justifying the aggressive actions of Georgia,\" the ministry said, adding that the G7 - Britain, France, Germany, the US, Italy, Japan and Canada - had made \"baseless assertions about Russia undermining Georgia's territorial integrity\".</p> <p>Russia foreign ministry spokesman Andrei Nesterenko criticised Nato for \"putting pressure\" on Russia and said there could be \"irreversible consequences\" for \"stability\" in Europe. Nato had no \"moral right\" to lecture Russia, he said.</p> <p>The Kremlin's defiant tone comes ahead of a special EU summit in Brussels on Monday, called by France, to discuss the EU's future ties with Russia. On Thursday, France's foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, intimated that sanctions would be discussed. Yesterday, the EU appeared to be retreating from this position. </p> <p>Moscow has made clear it will respond to any punitive measures from Brussels, which could include the suspension of a new EU-Russia partnership agreement. \"The time to pass sanctions has certainly not come,\" said a diplomat from France, which holds the EU presidency.</p> <p>Analysts in Moscow said last night that Russia's leadership was relatively unconcerned about the threat of EU sanctions. \"I don't think the contemporary west has any means to punish a state that is not quite a rogue state,\" Yulia Latynina, a commentator with the independent Echo of Moscow radio station told the Guardian. She added: \"The Kremlin didn't take Tbilisi and didn't shoot [Mikheil] Saakashvili. Expelling Russia from the G8 or the World Trade Organisation isn't important.\"</p> <p>Strategically, she said, prime minister Vladimir Putin has satisfied his personal feeling towards Mr Saakashvili. \"The war was brilliant in its design.\"</p> <p>Other analysts said they did not expect Russia to reverse its recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, despite the prospect of the states' international isolation. So far, only Belarus had said it will join Russia in recognising the two states.</p> <p>\"I think they are watching very closely to see what will happen at the EU summit,\" said Grigorii V Golosov, professor at the faculty of political sciences at the European University of St Petersburg. \"But I think the Kremlin calculation is that the EU won't react seriously.\" </p> <p>Putin's interview with CNN on Thursday - in which he blamed the war in Georgia on a Washington plot to propel John McCain into the White House - was a deliberate tactic, Golosov said. Putin's aim was to promote divisions between the EU and Washington.</p> <p>Yesterday, Igor Sechin, the deputy prime minister, dismissed a report in the Daily Telegraph that Moscow was preparing to cut oil deliveries to western Europe, calling the claim \"a gross provocation\".</p>",
  "<p>Oh how the McCain campaign must have chuckled when they got an inkling of what the Obama strategists had in mind as the backdrop for his acceptance speech in the stadium of the Denver Broncos, surmounted by an apparently neutered plaster stallion. Architrave alert! Fluted columns! Cecil B DeMille Doric! What a gift to satirists who could lampoon Obama as a wannabe Demosthenes, so self-monumentalised that he seemed to be presumptuously rehearsing the inaugural oath on the Capitol steps. It's possible that, even after one of the most memorably dramatic speeches in modern American history, they may still be betting on what they think is an eloquence aversion out there in the heartland; the ingrained suspicion that fancy phrase-making is a fig leaf for lack of substance. Early in the primary season Hillary Clinton made much of the difference between words and deeds, as if high rhetoric was a tip-off to political inadequacy. Beware fine words, that unsubtle message ran, for they are gossamer, the pretty fabric you spin when you can't hack the hard stuff of power. By this reasoning, McCain is a shoo-in, not in spite of his shortcomings in the eloquence department, but because of it. The Hanoi Hilton, after all, was a place of terrifying silence, and aw shucks will beat silver tongue every time with the regular Joes and Janes.</p> <p>But this year, the year of primal national scream in the US, is this smart politics? In the end the Republican posture of laconic authenticity, of Quiet Americans, may backfire. For what Obama delivered on Thursday night deliberately left pyrotechnics to the literal fireworks that brought the convention to an end. Instead he delivered severity; combative polemic over the hurting body of the republic; a gripping sense of the magnitude of the moment, without ever dropping his audience into resignation or pessimism. It was the least showy and, by some distance I think, the most moving and powerful of all his remarkable speeches, for its eschewal of rhetorical flamboyance was done in the service of a higher goal: the rebirth of what he called in his stirring peroration \"common purpose\", meaning the reassertion of mutuality without the compromise of individuality. </p> <p>It is this insistence of being one's brother's and sister's keeper as a pure American ideal, the questioning of what an \"ownership society\" means, that was so heartening. What Obama seems to be after is not just the reawakening of national community, but altering what an election campaign actually is. \"You can make a big election small,\" he said, witheringly, of the decades of Lee Atwater, Roger Ailes and Karl Rove. The time is too serious, the stakes too high, to tolerate that kind of politics. After cataloguing the Bush administration's manifold failures, something happened to his voice that, in the months that I have followed him since the Iowa caucuses, I have never heard: a ferocious roar of fury bellowed into the microphone. And the word that formed in the fire of his indignation was, simply: \"ENOUGH!\" It was a Shakespearean moment that shook the eighty thousand rigid, and ought to have disabused any Republicans of the idle assumption that they are taking on a remote, effete intellectual who doesn't have the wherewithal for bloody political combat.</p> <p>So Obama is betting on the word's enduring power as a reformer of American life. Historically he has good reason for, from the beginning, words and texts have constructed American realities, not the other way round. The spell cast on Americans by the mantle of words goes all the way back to the first Great Awakening in the 1740s when flocks thrilled to Methodist preachers such as George Whitefield. Evangelical passion remains a brilliant strand in the weave of American discourse, but when it made way for the reasoning of the enlightenment deists and unitarians who made the revolution, another element of American speech-power sounded loud and clear: the reverence for classical oratory. </p> <p>The Republican bet is that all this is a thing of the past; that, self-evidently, we live in the age of images, and words are just the add-ons to the beguilement of the eye; that all we have are soundbites. Obama's is the more stunning gamble; that so far from the digital age killing off the reign of the word, it has actually given logos a whole new lease of life. </p> <p>As I write this, the diapason of Martin Luther King's rhetoric on August 28 1963 rolls over the stadium again, while beside me a row of bloggers writing for <a href=\"http://www.blackamericaweb.com\">blackamericaweb.com</a> tap their keyboards. In downtown Denver the places where energy spilled over were certainly not the citadels of CNN or the networks but the spaces occupied by the Daily Kos, Wonkette and the rest. The blog and the great speech are the low and the high of the enduring dominion of American words; and Obama is betting that words still have the force to remake politics, and even government. Obama is Dick Cheney's worst nightmare, for he represents the antidote to the unanswerably laconic. Has there even been a politician who revelled in deadly quietness quite so much as Cheney?</p> <p>Ravelled up inside that gamble is another daring hunch: that, of all Americans, Obama is uniquely qualified to braid together the two great strands of national rhetoric. On the one hand, that of black redemption: saturated with scriptural passion; the eloquence of Martin Luther King (whom in a wonderful conceit Obama simply called \"the Preacher\"); the language that altered what Lyndon Johnson believed and did. And on the other, the rhetoric of American classicism: Lincoln's, Franklin Roosevelt's and Jack Kennedy's. From these distinct threads he is hoping to make a new American fabric of speech.</p> <p>On this evening though, Obama knew he had to make his words do two things: go on unsparing attack against his opponent, and somehow become a natural extension of the everyday life of suffering Americans. The attack speech, delivered with sombre coldness, did the job. Taking his high concerns to regular Americans was the tougher assignment. Knowing there could be no point in making Obama sound like a trucker faced with foreclosure, the campaign hit on the clever device of having a parade of indisputably middle-class Americans, some long-time Republicans, deliver their grievances to camera. The populist voice comes right from the populus.</p> <p>What Obama did is to touch the nerve of what he knows most Americans care about: old-fashioned virtues - the \"dignity of hard work\"; the promise of fair reward for that work; patriotism; the \"promise\" that if they live right and do right, their children will reap the reward of that promise. \"That's why I am here,\" he said, \"that's what I think every time I tuck my children up at night.\"</p> <p>Suddenly Obama becomes not a politician but a dad, who needs no prompting to understand the heroism of everyday life. In another agile counterpunch at the Republican accusation that he is no more than a \"celebrity\", Obama, speaking of the sacrifices of his mother and grandparents, said: \"I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine. These are my heroes.\" And equally suddenly McCain turns into the patrician who isn't sure how many homes he owns.</p> <p>In contrast to Al Gore's sententiousness and John Kerry's high-minded elegance, Obama is light on his feet and deadly with his jabs, a pre-emptive warrior. A parade of generals and admirals attest to his fitness to be commander in chief, but more spunkily he says: \"If John McCain to have a debate about who has the temperament ... to serve as the next commander in chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have.\" From this unlikely investment of authority, he says to McCain: \"Let us agree that patriotism has no party ... so I've got news for you ... We all put our country first.\"</p> <p>Obama is staking the whole house on a belief that the times are so serious, the damage wrought in the past eight years so grave, that for once the American voters are hungry for a reborn sense of national community, and a president who embodies it. It's commonplace that the problem for McCain is that he is too old, and for Obama that he's too young. But one of the transformations that happened in this speech was to make Obama seem a whole lot older, or at least more grown up, than McCain. As he himself says, his call for a rekindled sense of common purpose can be written off as so much \"happy talk\". The campaign can go straight downhill to its customary depths. But the Republicans had better practice an unaccustomed economy of derision, for after Obama's severe magnificence, an attack on his style carries the risk of churlishness: the grim snicker of the crabbed.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Simon Schama's series The American Future: A History will be screened on BBC2 next month, when his book of the same title will be published</p>",
  "<p>Canute was not quite the model of political modesty that Timothy Garton Ash supposes in proposing him as an example for Obama (Comment, August 28). As a devout Christian he certainly believed it was up to God to command the tides, but as a Viking he knew a thing or two about ruling the waves. As king of a unified England, he pursued an aggressively expansionist foreign policy, which included the annexation of Scotland, Denmark, Norway and part of Sweden. Historians have hailed him as the architect of the first English - or Anglo-Viking - empire.</p> <p>As Garton Ash argues, any attempt to prop up the tottering American empire through the exercise of hard power is doomed, and Obama is unlikely to emulate Canute in this respect. But there are other parts of the story which may offer more pertinent lessons. Canute went out of his way to heal the rifts created by his victory over Aethelred. He chose the English king's widow as his \"running mate\", and apologised for past wrongdoings by rebuilding many of the churches destroyed during earlier Viking invasions. If only Obama had done a Canute in this sense, to make it up with Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>His choice of Joe Biden also suggests he is going to rely on his undoubted rhetorical skills to stage-manage US world influence through the exercise of soft power, while continuing to ignore the strategic consequences of economic and even military decline relative to China. And where is the new thinking about how to make proper restitution to the people of Iraq and Afghanistan whose lives have been blighted by the war against terror?<br><strong>Phil Cohen</strong><br>Wivenhoe, Essex</p>",
  "<p>In a 24-hour rolling news cycle nothing lasts for long. Yesterday afternoon there was an almost audible screeching of gears as the blogocracy abandoned its post-Obama analysis mid-sentence and \"Sarah Palin\" became the hottest search terms on Google. John McCain's choice of the obscure Alaska governor as running mate caused enough shock and awe to wash the Denver convention off the airwaves. Which is a shame. For, in years to come - and especially if he becomes the first black president of the United States - the 2008 Democratic convention will rightly be remembered as Barack Obama's moment in history and for the climactic political theatre of his open-air acceptance speech on Thursday evening. What may not be so often recalled was the sometimes ruthless hard politics that went into Obama's success in Denver this week. It helped turn a convention that threatened up to the last minute to be unmanageable into a successful launchpad for the Democratic assault on the White House on November 4.</p> <p>First things, however, must be said first. The Democrats made bold, optimistic and wonderful history in Denver this week. No one with any sense of either America's past or of the long march for human justice can fail to be inspired by the sight of an American political party nominating a black man to lead a country with such a long, shameful and bloody history of racial division. That it should happen on the anniversary of the great speech in which Martin Luther King dreamed of the day in which his children would be judged, not by the colour of their skin, but by the content of their character, was magnificently fitting. Whether the majority of American voters in enough states will have enough confidence in Obama's campaign for change to elect him as their president remains to be seen. But it is the political question of the next 67 days.</p> <p>Mr Obama will not get elected just because he is an orator. His speech in Denver marked a recognition that elections are won on the basis of policy pledges and by framing the contest in a clear and sometimes confrontational way. In his acceptance speech, which will have been the first time that many voters have listened to him, Mr Obama framed the election as a classic contest between aspiration - the \"American promise\" - and fear. He offered a substantial menu of domestic spending promises on health, education and the environment, along with individual and small business tax cuts, though there was less detail about how he will pay for them. And he went on the offensive against Mr McCain on foreign and security policy, seeking to tie his opponent to the Bush years and hinting that he will make Mr McCain's age and temperament into campaign issues.</p> <p>All this shows that Mr Obama is a clear-eyed not a dewy-eyed campaigner. He managed the potentially divisive convention with great firmness, recognising that the supporters of Hillary Clinton must have their moments but never allowing them to indulge themselves. The Clintons, especially Bill Clinton, responded impeccably. But it was all done on Mr Obama's unflinching terms, and he was notably less conciliatory to his opponents in his speech than they were to him in theirs. </p> <p>Now, though, another fight begins, this time against opponents who will stop at nothing to exploit his weaknesses, which exist. Sarah Palin is a daring choice by McCain. She is a young, fresh, outside-the-Beltway conservative with great appeal to the republican grassroots. She is also massively inexperienced, at a stroke neutralising the very same charge against Obama. How, with an elderly potential president, Americans will judge governor Palin on the heartbeat test may prove critical in the months ahead. The times call for fresh vision and toughness. Mr Obama will need plenty of both if his dream is to become the reality for which we hope.</p>",
  "<p>His enemies had mocked him as a celebrity, a self-styled messiah, a would-be emperor, puffed up on his own rhetoric and grandiosity. But by the time Barack Obama had completed his speech to an ecstatic crowd of 84,000 in Denver's huge Invesco Field football stadium, he looked like something else entirely: a plausible President of the United States. </p> <p>By relocating the Democratic national convention to an outdoor arena, he had chosen a setting that would have overwhelmed most speakers. But Obama had no such trouble. He emerged soon after sunset, the night sky lit up by floodlights, a thousand popping flashbulbs and that billion-dollar smile projected on the enormous TV screens. For most in the stadium, he was no more than a pencil line on the stage, a slight, skinny man standing alone. Yet when he uttered the words: \"I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States,\" he caused an eruption, a long, sustained roll of human thunder. </p> <p>He had barely started but, all around, the tears were flowing - whether from Oprah Winfrey in the VIP area or the flag-waving party activists four tiers up in the sky. Many saw fate's hand in anointing the first African-American presidential nominee on the anniversary - to the day - of the moment in 1963 when Martin Luther King stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and told the world he had a dream, of an America where black and white would at last live together as equals.</p> <p>Obama brought them to hush. Behind him a stage set, mocked by the Republicans as looking like a Greek temple suited to Obama's imperial pretensions, glowed with warm amber light. </p> <p>His voice filled the stadium, holding everyone rapt. No one doubted that Obama had the oratorical gifts to make a fine, soaring speech. The advance pressure on him was of a different kind. He had specific, earthier tasks to accomplish - and so, methodically he set to work. </p> <p>First, he needed to show there was policy substance behind the inspiring talk.</p> <p>He did that, promising to cut taxes for \"95% of working families\". He would make college affordable to all those who undertook national service. He would invest $150bn (\u00a382bn) over 10 years in renewable energy. And he made a promise: to wean the US off its dependence on \"Middle East oil\" in 10 years. </p> <p>Still, this was no laundry list of programmes and policies. Obama rested it all first on the clear premise that America's economy is ailing and, more striking, on an unabashed case for the role of government itself. \"Government cannot solve all our problems,\" he said, \"but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves.\" He went on: \"That's the promise of America ... the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper.\"</p> <p>Obama had a second, related task on Thursday. His critics had said he was too aloof, too remote from the workaday concerns of ordinary Americans currently feeling the squeeze. He needed to show, as Bill Clinton once did, that he could feel their pain. He did that effectively, binding his own life story to those of the most vulnerable Americans. He said that in the faces of the young veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan he saw his grandfather who had \"marched in Patton's army\". When he saw those working the night shift, he thought of his mother, who had brought up her children alone and once had to turn to the state support of food stamps. When he met workers laid off, he recalled those he had fought for as a community organiser in the deprived South Side of Chicago. </p> <p>It was a skilful passage, making himself indivisible from the very people with whom he has struggled to connect and whom he must win over in November. He rounded it off with a masterful line, designed to puncture what has proved to be one of the McCain camp's most effective attacks on him: that his star power puts him in the world of Paris Hilton and Britney Spears, out of reach of most Americans. Obama said sharply: \"I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine.\" </p> <p>There was a third doubt Obama needed to lay to rest. Does he have the toughness, the steel to take on and defeat the notoriously vicious attack machine that has seen the Republicans win all but three of the last 10 presidential elections?</p> <p>Obama left no doubt. He dared attack McCain in his strongest area: national security. He launched into a devastating critique of the Bush administration, casting McCain as nothing more than a loyal echo for its fatal combination of \"tough talk and bad strategy\". </p> <p>He lectured him on folly after folly: \"You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in 80 countries by occupying Iraq.\" He said Bush's decision to switch the focus from Afghanistan to Iraq had let the real culprits of 9/11 slip out of America's sights. \"John McCain likes to say that he'll follow Osama bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives.\"</p> <p>That was delivered with a hint of aggression not many had seen before. But it was as nothing next to the moment when he truly threw down the gauntlet, declaring: \"If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander-in-chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have.\"</p> <p>One former Democratic speechwriter used to say: \"There is a subtext of male violence to American politics.\" He meant that presidential candidates have to signal a kind of gladiatorial toughness, a readiness to stand up and throw a punch. Obama did that in that line, not least by daring to raise what has been much talked about in Washington circles but not raised explicitly: the question of McCain's emotional and mental balance. </p> <p>It ended with a passage alluding to King's speech of 45 years ago. \"We cannot walk alone,\" he said. The response was rapturous, of course. It was the delight of a party that had witnessed a historic breakthrough, but something more exciting still: an extraordinarily gifted man demonstrating the fundamental seriousness to serve in the highest office in the land.</p> <h2>What the papers said</h2> <p>One test of a presidential candidate's strength, and often his best shot at winning, is how much he can mould his party in his image and rally it around a powerful argument for his election.

  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337128463\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>John McCain took the biggest gamble of his campaign so far when he yesterday chose as his running mate Sarah Palin, the relatively unknown and inexperienced governor of Alaska, in the hope of reaching out to women voters.</p> <p>Introduced by McCain at a rally in Dayton, Ohio, Palin made a direct appeal to supporters of Hillary Clinton still upset over her defeat by Barack Obama, praising Clinton for her \"determination and grace\" in the nomination battle.</p> <p>Palin's place on the ticket means the November 4 election will produce either the first African-American president or the first female vice-president.</p> <p>She was a surprise choice, with even senior Republicans confessing on television yesterday that they had never met her or knew much about her. Before becoming governor, she had been mayor of the Alaskan town of Wasilla, with a population of 9,000.</p> <p>At the rally, McCain, who celebrated his 72nd birthday yesterday, lauded her as reformer and Washington outsider. Explaining why he had picked her over established politicians, he said: \"I have been looking for a running mate that will shake up Washington.\"</p> <p>He also hopes to win over women voters, noting that her appointment coincided with this week's anniversary of American women being given the vote.</p> <p>Palin, only the second woman to be a vice-presidential candidate - Geraldine Ferraro was on the Democratic ticket in 1984 - noted that Clinton had received 18 million votes in the Democratic nomination fight and that Clinton had characterised this as putting 18 million cracks in the ceiling that limits women's options.</p> <p>Palin said the women of America were not finished yet and \"we can shatter the glass ceiling once and for all\".</p> <p>Aged 44 and describing herself as a \"hockey mom\", she is a social conservative who will help offset suspicions of traditional Republicans over McCain because of his maverick behaviour.</p> <p>McCain's choice allowed him to wrest media attention from Obama, whose speech in front of a crowd of 80,000 in Denver on Thursday night is believed to be the most watched convention speech ever. Nielsen Media Research said it averaged 38.4 million US viewers across all major networks, reaching nearly a quarter of all US households. It easily eclipsed the acceptance speeches of both of Obama's two immediate Democratic predecessors and the 27.6 million viewers George Bush drew on the fourth night of the Republican national convention in 2004, when he was nominated for a second term. </p> <p>Obama's team seized on Palin's lack of experience. Bill Burton, a campaign spokesman, said: \"John McCain put the former mayor of a town of 9,000 with zero foreign policy a heartbeat away from the presidency.\"</p> <p>Her appointment undercuts one of the main charges of McCain against Obama: that he lacks experience to be president.</p> <p>McCain could be disappointed in his hopes of winning over disenchanted Democratic women. Among socially conservative views held by Palin that many Democrats would find unattractive is her strong anti-abortion position.</p> <p>The choice of Palin was kept a secret until only hours before the rally. She had briefly surfaced as a potential candidate about a month ago and then disappeared, in part because of an investigation under way in Alaska.</p> <p>Speculation was revived early yesterday when a staff worker at the airport in Dayton reported that a plane, owned by a wealthy supporter, had flown in from Anchorage, Alaska.</p> <p>McCain opted against the names that have been on the shortlist over the last few months: Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts and wealthy businessman; Joe Lieberman, the former Democratic senator and now an independent; and Tim Pawlenty, governor of Minnesota.</p> <p>There was puzzlement among senior Republicans over his choice.</p> <p>Kay Bailey Hutchison, the Texas senator who had been on McCain's shortlist, expressed support for her in a CNN interview but had to admit: \"I do not know too much about her. But maybe that is good news.\"</p> <p>McCain heads to the Republican convention scheduled to start in Minneapolis-St Paul on Monday. But organisers said the opening might have to be delayed by a day or two, if there is widespread devastation in the Gulf coast states from Tropical Storm Gustav.</p> <p>Bush is due to join McCain on the platform on Monday but the White House said that he might instead have to go to the Gulf states.</p>",
  "<p>She hunts. She fishes. She was voted Miss Congeniality after winning a beauty pageant in her small town in Alaska. She is a mother of five and a churchgoer who says her favourite meal is moose stew.</p> <p>But the quality that may serve Sarah Palin best after being chosen by John McCain as his running mate yesterday may be the competitiveness and determination to win that earned her the name Sarah Barracuda for her sharp elbows as high school basketball player.</p> <p>Palin, 44, the first female governor of Alaska and the first woman on a Republican presidential ticket, has a life story that could make a conservative Republican swoon. But until yesterday even Palin thought it far-fetched that she could be a figure on a national stage.</p> <p>In an interview last month, she even let slip that she did not think the job of vice-president was very meaningful. \"As for that VP talk all the time, I'll tell you, I still can't answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the VP does every day,\" she told CNBC. \"I'm used to being very productive and working real hard in an administration.\"</p> <p>McCain is hoping his selection will help win over disaffected supporters of Hillary Clinton who might rally towards a woman candidate, and that Palin's reputation as an anti-corruption crusader could banish the aura of the past that hangs over his candidacy. </p> <p>Born in Idaho, Palin moved to Alaska as a child. She married her high school sweetheart, Todd Palin, who works on the oilfields and is a champion snowmobile racer. The couple live on a lake, own a float plane, and have raised five children. Their eldest son is in the army and is about to deploy to Iraq. Their youngest son is six months old and was born with Down's syndrome.</p> <p>She is a fierce opponent of abortion and same-sex marriage. She supports the death penalty and the teaching of creationism in schools. Palin is an enthusiast for the outdoors and a gun owner, and is opposed to environmental restrictions on drilling in Alaska. </p> <p>While virtually unknown to the average American before yesterday, Palin has been a rising star in political circles since 2006. She challenged the incumbent Republican governor, who was then under the shadow of a corruption scandal, in the state primary, and went on to beat her Democratic opponent - a rare bright light for Republicans in 2006 who were losing across the map.</p> <p>As governor, she has demonstrated a populist flair. She sold the official governor's plane and took commercial flights. She drives to work in the family Volkswagen Jetta. In an attempt to soften the burden on Alaskans of high petrol prices, she proposed giving every household a $100 (\u00a355) energy debit card. Palin has also tried to cut government spending, shutting down a bridge project that would have cost $400m.</p> <p>But she has a long list of political enemies. She is also under investigation into whether she intervened to sack a state trooper who was involved in a divorce and custody battle with her sister. Palin is alleged to have transferred the commissioner of public safety, Walter Monegan, to a job at the state alcohol board last month, after he refused to sack the police official. </p>",
  "<p>It may not have matched Denver's annual livestock show, which has been known to draw well over half a million, but the Democratic National Convention was still an extraordinary display of political theatre. Fifty thousand delegates and 15,000 members of the media descended on the city; 2,500 FBI agents and police patrolled the Pepsi Centre. Obama merchandise abounded; celebrities were spotted; Hillary Clinton supporters demonstrated, as did anti-war activists, though not in the numbers predicted. The air space above Denver was closed; taxis were like gold-dust; tempers frayed, and while Democrats healed, TV anchors fell out with each other, live on air. </p> <h2>Most historic moment</h2> <p>Obviously, the stirring bipartisan healing between Pepsi and Coke, one of which sponsored the venue while the other sponsored the massive recycling operation. But Barack Obama's open-air nomination speech, which made him the first ever African-American presidential candidate for a major US party, came pretty close. \"America, we cannot turn back,\" Obama told the tearful crowd, who later spoke of John F Kennedy, and Martin Luther King. Even John McCain released an ad acknowledging that it was a \"job well done\" - though he probably recorded the ad before the speech.</p> <h2>Worst misreading of Obama's speech</h2> <p>The Associated Press. While almost every other commentator, from left to right, dissected Obama's decision to focus on specifics, instead of lofty rhetoric, AP commentator Charles Babington heard a speech in which Obama, \"instead of dwelling on specifics, he laced the crowning speech of his long campaign with the type of rhetorical flourishes ...\" Meanwhile, most cautious pre-speech headline was on CNN's website: \"Obama expected to address change in speech.\" No kidding.</p> <h2>Most absurd act of public therapy</h2> <p>Wednesday's staged roll-call vote, in which delegates got to voice support for Hillary Clinton, before Clinton herself \"spontaneously\" stepped forward to award the nomination to Obama.</p> <h2>Best recovery from a setback</h2> <p>New Mexico governor and former presidential candidate Bill Richardson, who got bumped from Wednesday's schedule, and had difficulty getting on to the convention floor because staff didn't recognise him, but who came back on Thursday to deliver this line: \"John McCain may pay hundreds of dollars for his shoes, but we'll all be paying for his flip-flops.\"</p> <h2>Best political rehabilitation</h2> <p>Democratic hero turned sore loser turned Democratic hero once more, Bill Clinton, who told delegates: \"People the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power.\"</p> <h2>Most inexplicable dentistry</h2> <p>Obama running-mate Joe Biden, who as we were regularly reminded takes the humble old train to work, and has a reported net worth of about $150,000 (\u00a382,000), yet still has the shiniest teeth American politics has ever seen, and that's saying a lot.</p> <h2>Most disappointing speech</h2> <p>Probably Michelle Obama's, because politics required her to present herself as a non-threatening first lady. You'd never have guessed she was a Harvard and Princeton grad with a knife-sharp sense of humour, though in a video prior to her address, she did recall first hearing of her future husband: \"Who names their kid Barack Obama? He must be weird.\" </p> <h2>Strangest interpretation of a speech</h2> <p>Puma PAC, one of the hardline pro-Clinton groups refusing to support Obama, who thought Clinton's invocation of Harriet Tubman in her endorsement of Obama (\"keep running!\") was a secret code meaning they should keep up their campaign</p>",
  "<p>There he goes again. John McCain went out and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.johnmccain1\">found himself a vice-presidential candidate</a> today, but as is often his way, he made sure that political gain was his master, while potential to lead this nation during troubled times was placed on the back burner.</p> <p>And he accuses Barack Obama of \"not putting his country first\"? </p> <p>McCain's choice was governor Sarah Palin of Alaska, a former mayor of a town the size of the building where I grew up in New York. More recently, she has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/29/johnmccain.uselections2008\">performing her gubernatorial duties</a> for an entire 1.5 years since her election in November of 2006. In other words, compared to her, when it comes to foreign policy experience, Obama is practically Napoleon.</p> <p>Meanwhile, she is what you might call a bit slow on the uptake. When asked on CNBC's talkshow Kudlow &amp; Co about some of the vice-presidential speculation surrounding her only a month ago, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0808/12969.html\">Palin's reaction</a> really speaks for itself:</p> <p>\"But as for that VP talk all the time, I'll tell ya, I still can't answer that question until somebody answers for me, what is it exactly that the VP does every day?\"</p> <p>Perhaps the vice-president, unlike Palin, might spend part of their day worrying about what to do about global warming rather than denying it, as she has.</p> <p>Making matters worse, Palin is currently <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/2008/08/29/palin-corruption-investigation/\">under investigation</a> for pressuring Alaska's former public safety commissioner, Walt Monegan, to fire her former brother-in-law Mike Wooten from his job as a state trooper. Her sister was embroiled in a nasty divorce with Wooten, and when Monegan didn't investigate, he was fired from his job. Palin denied any involvement at first, yet has since <a href=\"http://www.adn.com/monegan/story/492964.html\">admitted that staff members contacted Monegan</a> about this matter. But she, of course, new nothing about it.</p> <p>The Alaska legislature, apparently filled with sentient beings, took that denial as seriously as you probably just did, and decided to <a href=\"http://www.adn.com/monegan/story/494556.html\">hire an independent investigator</a>.</p> <p>It is clear why McCain made this choice. He is hoping to win over still-angry Hillary Clinton supporters and other independent women, although when these women become aware of the fact that she believes abortion should be outlawed, voted for \u00fcber-right-wing commentator Pat Buchanan for president in 2000 and recently called senator Clinton a \"whiner\", well, many women may conclude that she just doesn't quite speak for them. </p> <p>They might also worry, like the rest of us, about a female Dan Quayle being a heartbeat away from the presidency. John McCain just turned 72 today (happy birthday senator!) and has had skin cancer.</p> <p>In the end, this is one more example of the real John McCain. He was against tax cuts for the wealthy before he was for them. He was against offshore oil drilling before he was for it. And he was against \"risking\" putting someone as untested as Obama in the White House, until he chose to put someone with the experience of Dudley Moore in the West Wing.</p>",
  "<p>In the terrible angst-ridden world of yesterday, half of Washington was convinced that John McCain had secretly fixed on <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/28/AR2008082801773.html\">offering his old pal Joe Lieberman</a> the other half of his ticket. That morning, on <a href=\"http://culture11.com/node/31828?page_art=0\">Culture11</a>, I argued that McCain had no hope of increasing his cachet as a maverick with a Lieberman pick. \"John wants Joe in order to flout ideology,\" I wrote. \"Joe's neoconservative boosters want him in order to flaunt it.\" Mitt Romney presented similar problems: he is the darling of the establishment conservative movement, but would do more to unbalance the ticket than balance it.</p> <p>Enter <a href=\"http://features.csmonitor.com/politics/2008/08/29/sarah-palin-mccains-pick-forged-maverick-political-path-in-alaska/\">Sarah Palin</a>.</p> <p>I've been urging a nod Palin's way for some time. As a candidate, she has so many attractive qualities that several legitimate-sounding narratives could be crafted around them. But it's worthwhile to sort out the superficial ones from the ones that fully justify lifting her out of relative obscurity in, as Americans are wont to say, the Great State of Alaska.</p> <p>Skin deep, Sarah Palin's advantages are plain. She's a woman. The McCain camp has grown certain that, although he regained something of the initiative during the Democrats' \"cathartic\" convention, Barack Obama is fundamentally weak on white, working-class families \u2014 families where women, and mothers specifically, occupy centre stage. Like them, Palin is a working mother juggling a number of great kids. Much of the buzz around Palin has been inspired by a desire among Republicans to exploit, as much as possible, the lingering divisions between Hillary and Barack Democrats: <em>Looking for a woman like you? Look no further than the McCain ticket!</em></p> <p>This is a chintzy version of a more respectable argument\u2014that Palin captures something essential about the best of both the pre-Bush and the post-Bush Republican party.</p> <p>This is the decisive advantage of a Palin pick. She reminds Americans that the Republican brand has always sought to connect its politics to the virtue and accessibility of living well and nobly. She's a former Miss Alaska runner-up, but she's no wealthy heiress. She's a young, competent, independent politician in a state whose senatorial scion, Ted Stevens, has just been renominated despite being deeply embroiled in one of the most egregious and longstanding instances of Republican corruption on the Hill.</p> <p>Palin, like other rising conservatives who haven't been born and raised in the beltway-obsessed establishment movement, is a sort of throwback progressive \u2014 a Christian against gay marriage who was also the first Alaska governor to extend benefits to same-sex couples. Obviously, such a stance is inadequate to true progressives and repugnant to reactionary conservatives. But it is a conservative embodiment of the cultural posture that Obama struck, during his convention speech, at least: we have our firm disagreements, but surely we can convert the common ground into common-sense policy.</p> <p>Palin has the opportunity to recast the 2008 election entirely \u2014 by proving that freshness and unpreparedness for office are not synonyms, and that Democrats do not have the corner on our broad, deep hopes for political revitalisation. Just as Obama brilliantly selected Biden to connect the ticket to the Democratic party of the pre- and post-Clinton years, McCain made the savvy and humane decision to connect his ticket to the years that bracket the Republicans' sorry Bush/DeLay era.</p> <p>As such, Palin, like Biden, is a victory for all America, and the beginnings of a promise that \u2014 young or old, Republican or Democrat \u2014 American leaders have the capacity to renovate their country's dysfunctional politics without waging a scorched-earth culture war.</p>",
  "<p>Nearly lost amid the political hoopla of two presidential nominating conventions is a sombre milestone. Friday was the <a href=\"http://www.nola.com/katrina/\">third anniversary of Hurricane Katrina's deadly strike</a> on the Gulf of Mexico coast, a catastrophe that nearly destroyed New Orleans and, with its aftermath of botched rescue efforts, has done more than anything but the Iraq war to discredit the Bush presidency. </p> <p>As if following some kind of karmic timetable, though, <a href=\"http://news.google.co.uk/news/url?sa=t&amp;ct=us/0-0-0&amp;fp=48bb0bb37a8a36e1&amp;ei=V3y7SNP0LqXYQaOEkdAC&amp;url=http%3A//www.cnn.com/2008/US/weather/09/01/gustav/&amp;cid=1241029694&amp;usg=AFQjCNG_4Ho6ft6iv__jXUzSomDa6MiPfA\"> Tropical Storm Gustav gathered strength</a> over the Caribbean and entered the Gulf. Forecasts indicate it will head toward Louisiana, meaning a possible deadly blow for New Orleans. The machinery of mass evacuations has cranked into motion across the Gulf coast. Fema and other federal agencies, having learned some lessons with Katrina, are <a href=\"http://www.thenewsstar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080828/UPDATES01/80828061\">pre-positioning aid and personnel</a>.</p> <p>And Republicans, whose convention to nominate John McCain for the presidency gets underway on Monday in St Paul, Minnesota, are panicking. White House officials say <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/2008/08/28/bush-gustav-rnc/\">President Bush may opt out of his planned Monday speech</a>, and there's talk of <a href=\"http://blogs.usatoday.com/ondeadline/2008/08/mccain-camp-gop.html\">postponing the convention altogether</a>. The potential spectacle of Republicans partying and launching political attacks on Barack Obama while a storm rains destruction on American communities would indeed hurt McCain's chances. It would seem callous - a Republican weakness to begin with - but also evoke images of the Katrina aftermath, when the Bush administration spent more time pinning blame on Democrats than on rescuing citizens trapped in flooded New Orleans.</p> <p>The fact that Republicans are concerned almost wholly with how things look, not the actual threat of the storm to life and property, isn't surprising. The fact is, America's leaders - Republican and Democrat - never really learned the lessons of Katrina. </p> <p>Katrina represented a failure of the government at all levels - not just in emergency management, but in the basic idea of government itself, protecting citizens from harm. In the decades before the storm hit, the US government embarked on an ambitious plan to protect New Orleans and its surrounding suburbs from hurricane storm surges. It managed to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/27/hurricanekatrina.usa\">totally botch the job</a>. Not only was the new levee system a patchwork, full of gaps and shoddy construction, some floodwalls were built using faulty designs and fell down soon after the water rose. </p> <p>Moreover, as scientists learned more about hurricanes, it was clear by the 1980s that New Orleans would be destroyed if a hurricane hit it head-on, as floodwaters swamped its levees and filled the city like a soup bowl. Every summer, as new hurricanes roared over Gulf waters, the US played a game of hurricane roulette with one of its major cities. Yet nothing was done to address this mortal threat. Meanwhile, the city itself and its surrounding marshes were sinking into the sea, steadily opening it to greater risks.</p> <p>New Orleans is an excellent proxy for the broader challenges posed by global warming, which will mean rising seas and (probably) bigger, more dangerous storms. The deltaic landscape of south Louisiana is changing very fast, so the risks from storms and flooding are rising faster than flat-footed, special interest-dominated American institutions are able to handle. In the coming decades, there will be more New Orleanses in America and elsewhere around the world. </p> <p>Katrina provided an early warning, offering some valuable lessons on how to handle climate change. Protecting New Orleans from future storms would mean not only preserving a US city and a valuable cultural heritage. It would force institutions to reform and devise smarter policies that could be adapted to the coming challenges.<br> But New Orleans proved too politically marginal to get much attention from Washington, and protecting and rebuilding it - which ought to be a national priority - soon became a tertiary concern. The result: The levee system is being upgraded, at a cost of $13bn. But the upgrades only protect against relatively weak storms. We're still playing hurricane roulette.</p> <p>Forecasters say <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/weather/08/29/gustav/index.html\">Gustav will strengthen</a> to a Category 4 storm, with wind speeds between 131-155 mph (210-249 km/hr), and would easily overwhelm the levees if it comes close enough to the city. That could undo the past three years of rebuilding, and destroy what Katrina missed.</p> <p>This is bad for New Orleans, of course. I am sceptical, given that the institutions charged with protecting it are so weak and slow-moving, that the city will still be there a century from now. But more ominously still, this shows how fundamentally unready the US government is to tackle the coming challenges of climate change.</p>",
  "<p>While the rest of Alaska slept Thursday night, Alaska governor Sarah Palin went to bed knowing that she was going to be <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/26454655\">tapped by John McCain to be his vice-presidential running mate</a>. We had heard the rumours. Although many here were enchanted by the idea, few in this state took it very seriously. But then again, Palin has surprised us before.</p> <p>When she ran for governor in 2006, people said she didn't have the experience to run a state more than twice the size of Texas, a state where oil is king and where one of the biggest construction projects in the world - a natural gas pipeline that would run from Alaska's North Slope through Canada - was in the midst of being negotiated.</p> <p>Prior to being governor, she had been a commissioner on the state's oil and gas conservation commission, and a two-term mayor of Wasilla, a small town in a valley about 40 miles north of Anchorage. It's a place of wide-open spaces, of small strip malls and big trucks. It's a place whose people were once called by senator Ted Stevens's son, Ben Stevens, \"valley trash\".</p> <p>But <a href=\"http://dwb.adn.com/news/politics/elections/story/8337406p-8233470c.html\">she ran as a change candidate</a>, someone who would put an end to the good old boys' regime that had a stranglehold on Alaska for so many years. And people turned out in droves for her, shocking Alaska's political establishment, the same establishment that awoke shocked by the headlines this morning.</p> <p>She is plenty popular here. At a time when Alaska's image is been dominated by corrupt, white, male politicians, her killer smile, designer glasses and modern-sculpture-like hair have given us something to be proud of. And it's not just her looks. She's certainly the first female governor to have filled more than a few freezers with moose that she's shot, and to prefer caribou steaks to beef tenderloins.</p> <p>Her husband is part Alaska Native, a roughneck on the North Slope, and they both own a fish camp in rural Alaska. She has five children - one of whom is in the army and another who was born while she was in office and has Down's syndrome - and has displayed a willingness to take on Alaska's big oil companies by imposing on them a large windfall profits tax. She's also a Christian who attends an evangelical church and is avidly pro-life. All of that would seem to balance out the ticket nicely.<br> But she has no national political experience, and her two years as governor haven't all been easy. They've been particularly tough recently. Earlier this month, <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gWi6yTVfPyJeiTBsQ33SSUiobt8wD92I9NIO0\">state legislators opened a special investigation</a> into whether she'd fired Alaska's popular public safety commissioner because he refused to fire a trooper who is her ex-brother-in-law.<br> It may seem small stuff at a time when so many of Alaska's Republican politicians are in trouble for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/30/usa.uselections2008\">accepting bribes and gifts</a> from an oil services contract company, but emails coming from Palin's office are currently being subpoenaed and witnesses are being questioned.<br> The most likely outcome is that the investigation will show that her administration - largely dominated by fellow Wasillans, as well as her husband who is known to give the long stare to those who criticise her - has been incompetent, and Palin's snarky side will emerge.</p> <p>Palin may use words like \"golly\" and phrases like, \"bless your heart\", but she can be tough on her adversaries, of whom she has a few here. She giggled loudly on air when the hosts of a local radio talkshow called one of those adversaries - state Senate president Lyda Green - a \"cancer\" and a \"bitch\". Green is a cancer survivor.</p> <p>In an email, she also called another one of her enemies, Andrew Halcro, who ran against her in 2006, a <a href=\"http://www.andrewhalcro.com/has_anybody_seen_mr_open_and_mrs_transparency\">\"dumbass\"</a>. </p> <p>Once again, small stuff, and those of you in the Lower 48 and the rest of the world will likely think so, too. But it's taken some of the shine off of Palin's veneer here in Alaska. For an outsider with such little experience, running with a 72-year-old man who has had cancer, Palin will need to shine more brightly than the northern star.</p>",
  "<p>In Denver on Wednesday, on the outskirts of the other team's convention, a few elderly Republicans held a press conference to launch a new offensive: \"Not Ready '08\". The gaggle of party elders took to the airwaves to cast doubt on Barack Obama's preparedness for the top job in the land. Obama, <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/08/27/rudy.html\">Rudy Giuliani told us</a>, was \"woefully ill-prepared to be the next president\": too young, too inexperienced, too untested.</p> <p>It was a ridiculous argument on Wednesday. But it's particularly jarring today, now that John McCain has <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/30/us/politics/29palin.html\">selected as his running mate</a> a politician who, just two years ago, was the <a href=\"http://www.cityofwasilla.com/\">mayor of Wasilla, Alaska</a> \u2013 population 8,471. Sarah Palin, <a href=\"http://gov.state.ak.us/bio.php\">Alaska's governor</a> since last year, may or may not have the political acumen to be one not-wholly-unlikely heart attack away from the Oval Office. But at a moment when McCain has sought to make hay from Obama's supposed weakness on foreign policy, a VP with zero experience in Washington seems at best bizarre. One <a href=\"http://www.ontheissues.org/Sarah_Palin.htm\">website that tracks elected officials' political views</a> has this entry for the governor under foreign policy: \"No issue stance yet recorded.\"</p> <p>So why pick the dark horse? Because, the defeatnik chorus will tell you, she is a woman, and an attractive one at that. But as an act of political calculus, the Palin move might not be as brilliant as some trembling Democrats fear. There was <a href=\"http://blog.macleans.ca/2008/08/28/will-mccain-pick-a-chick/\">no shortage of women</a> McCain could have chosen: Texas senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and former eBay chief executive Meg Whitman both had a shot at the number two spot on the ticket, and both would have provided an impressive counterbalance. To choose such an outsider, one of so few accomplishments, smacks of opportunism and, hopefully, won't stick. Whatever resentments linger among Hillary Clinton's advocates, to suggest that soft Obama supporters can be hoodwinked into voting for a pair of pro-life politicians \u2013 he quietly so, she profoundly \u2013 doesn't reflect the reality of American politics; it isn't just sexist but naive.</p> <p>For the moment the media have a new darling, and in the coming days we will here endless loops of how the self-professed \"hockey mom\" made the brave decision to carry her fifth child to term despite his Down syndrome \u2013 a major plus with those conservatives who threatened to rebel when the pro-choice Tom Ridge was mooted. But Palin's shine will dull quickly. In America, Alaska's nickname is \"The Last Frontier\" \u2014 and the state has a reputation for some of the dirtiest politics in the country. It's Alaska that gave us Ted Stevens, the recently indicted senator who took buckets of money from oil companies, some of which paid for his home renovations. How did Palin, the self-professed reformer, <a href=\"http://www.adn.com/news/politics/story/478749.html\">react to Stevens' indictment</a>? By saying he had \"dedicated his life to the betterment of the state.\"</p> <p>I wonder whether the Republicans' veep choice, a woman younger than Obama, will seem so appealing to undecided voters when national media pick up on the central feature of her brief career as Alaska's governor: her alleged scheming to get her ex-brother-in-law fired from his job as a state trooper. Palin pressured one of her officials to sack the guy, who was involved in a messy custody battle with her sister; when the commissioner refused, she <a href=\"http://www.adn.com/monegan/story/478090.html\">booted him from office</a>. Now Palin won't be around Juneau while an independent investigator looks into the affair and her seeming abuse of power. Instead she'll be on the campaign trail, asking Americans to believe, seriously, that she has the wisdom and rectitude to stand first in line to succeed to the presidency.</p>",
  "<h2>Mitt Romney</h2> <p>Had Mitt Romney been picked, it would've been akin to Barack Obama choosing Hillary Clinton for his running mate. Romney, former governor of Massachusetts, was McCain's chief rival for the Republican nomination, and as such spent several months savaging the Arizona senator in debates and in the press. He bowed out of the race in February and spent the ensuing months currying favour with conservatives.</p> <p>The scion of a prominent Michigan political family \u2013 his father was governor of the state \u2013 Romney spent his early adulthood as a Mormon missionary in France. He was heralded for his management of the 2002 winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, and grew extremely wealthy as a venture capitalist. Elected governor of Massachusetts in 2002, he governed as a moderate \u2013 necessary in that liberal state.</p> <p>Romney is acclaimed for his business acumen and can speak fluently on the economy \u2013 an admitted weakness for McCain. His ties to Michigan may have helped win that crucial swing state, which has not voted Republican since 1988.</p> <p>But in the wake of McCain's \"houses\" gaffe \u2013 the senator was unable to tell a reporter how many homes he and his wife, heiress to a beer distributing company, own \u2013 the Republican party may have been reluctant to present a ticket with two extremely wealthy men. Romney is also perceived as unfriendly to workers, having presided over layoffs during his tenure in the private sector.</p> <p>Another strike against Romney is his Mormon faith. The evangelical Christian faction of the Republican party, powerful in recent years, already distrusts McCain.</p> <p>Some conservatives remain distrustful of Romney's commitment to social conservative fundamentals like opposition to abortion rights and gay rights. Massachusetts is one of the most liberal states in the union, and during the Republican primary, Romney was criticised for backing a universal healthcare programme in the state during his tenure as governor.</p> <h2>Tim Pawlenty</h2> <p>Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty's staid reputation and uncharismatic manner mask a self-deprecating sense of humour: in spring, he praised his wife's willingness to watch hockey games with him, but said 'Now, if I could only get her to have sex with me.'\"</p> <p>Crass jokes aside, Pawlenty had many attributes favourable among the Republican base: long-time attendance at an evangelical church, consistent conservative stances on social issues, and opposition to tax increases. He also has the blue-collar background much sought after among American politicians. That presents a marked contrast to McCain, the son and grandson of admirals. </p> <p>At 47, his relative youth would have provided a needed contrast to McCain's advanced age, and he is fresh on the national scene. Minnesota has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate in recent memory, but in 2004 chose Democrat John Kerry by 51% to 48%. </p> <p>Pawlenty was first elected governor in 2002. He won re-election in 2006 by a narrow margin, leading national Republicans to question his popularity in his home state. Also, he is an unproven debater, while Joe Biden, Barack Obama's running mate, is skilled and experienced.</p> <h2>Joseph Lieberman</h2> <p>This Connecticut senator would have surely shaken things up in the race. He is a career-long Democrat who split with the party in 2006 over the Iraq war, and he is an orthodox Jew. But he is well used to the rigours of a vice-presidential campaign, having run alongside Democrat Al Gore in 2000 and come within a hair's breadth of the White House. Lieberman and McCain also enjoy a friendly personal relationship and the two have travelled together extensively. </p> <p>A McCain-Lieberman ticket would've also blunted one of the Democrats' major campaign themes \u2013 that the Republican party failed the nation in eight years in power and it is time to replace them.</p> <p>But the Connecticut senator had several major drawbacks. For one, many Republicans simply won't trust a former Democrat on the ticket and would be unenthusiastic. An independent senator, Lieberman votes with the Democrats on most issues and has amassed a moderate voting record. Also, as a supporter of abortion rights and an orthodox Jew, he could have clashed with social conservative voters.</p> <p>A former state attorney general, Lieberman was first elected to the senate in 1988. He won re-election in 2006 as an independent after being defeated in the Democratic primary by an antiwar candidate.</p> <h2>Eric Cantor</h2> <p>This young Virginia congressman took part in early August in a conference call with reporters to attack Barack Obama's energy plan, leading to speculation he was auditioning to be McCain's running mate.</p> <p>At 45, Cantor is relatively inexperienced, first winning election to the US House of Representatives in 2000. But he could've added much-needed youth to the Republican ticket, and he is good looking and would have been presented as a Washington outsider.</p> <h2>Tom Ridge</h2> <p>The former Pennsylvania governor may have helped deliver that key swing state and as the first secretary of homeland security under President George Bush, can claim national security credentials. Ridge was a US congressman from 1983 to 1995, then served six years as governor of Pennsylvania before moving to Washington to be a homeland security adviser.</p> <p>But Ridge is a supporter of abortion rights. Conservative leaders have warned that Ridge on the ticket would've been disastrous for McCain's chances in the fall, as anti-abortion Republicans would be inclined to stay home instead of rally for the candidate.</p>",
  "<p>Picking the Alaska governor is a bold play from John McCain for the potentially millions of disaffected Hillary Clinton voters who have remained impervious to Democrats' pleas for party unity. She presents a new face unfamiliar to most of America, and is likely to stir up the race and excite the news media. </p> <p>At 44, she is a youthful addition to the Republican ticket. Sarah Palin is an avid angler and hunter, a member of the politically powerful National Rifle Association, and her husband has native-American roots. She is also a former runner-up in the Miss Alaska beauty contest.</p> <p>But Palin brings several risks. She has been in office less than two years, and would be hard pressed to go toe-to-toe in debate with Democratic vice-presidential nominee Joe Biden, a veteran senator and foreign policy expert.</p> <p>The Democrats will also raise questions about whether Palin passes the \"commander-in-chief test\" \u2014 that is, would she be able to assume the presidency should McCain, 72, become incapacitated. The news media may also seek to tie Palin to longtime Alaska Republican senator Ted Stevens, who is under indictment on corruption charges.</p> <p>Before taking office in December 2006, Palin served two terms as mayor of Wasilla, Alaska, and was on the city's council before that. </p> <p>Her nomination poses an interesting choice for the US electorate between the country's first African-American president and its first woman vice-president. But she is not the first woman to be nominated for the post \u2014 that was Geraldine Ferraro, the Democratic nominee in 1984 (the year Palin entered Miss Alaska). </p> <p>Politically, Palin is a fiscal and social conservative, but has cultivated a reputation as a maverick and a reformer, and claims to have cut taxes while improving public services. In 2007 she vetoed 13% of Alaska's proposed budget for capital projects. Her popularity is riding high at the moment, with approval ratings of 80%. </p> <p>She differs with McCain over the issue of drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve, although it is McCain's opposition to oil prospecting in Alaska that is probably more out of tune with the bulk of the party. </p> <p>Palin rose to attention in Alaska in 2003 while serving on the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, blowing the whistle on violations of state ethical regulations by Republican party leaders.<br> However, she is under investigation herself over allegations that she dismissed state public safety commissioner Walter Monegan because he would not sack a state trooper involved in an acrimonious divorce with her younger sister. Palin has told US television networks she has \"nothing to hide\".</p> <p>Palin eats moose burgers, goes ice fishing, rides snowmobiles, runs marathons, manages a hockey team and owns a seaplane, according to US reports. She is also a Christian.<br> Her husband Todd is a native American who works for oil giant BP and is also a commercial fisherman. Their eldest son, Track, joined the US army at the age of 18 as an infantryman and is due to be deployed to Iraq. </p> <p>She is staunchly anti-abortion. On learning she was pregnant with a child with Downs Syndrome, she went on to have the baby. Her second son, Trig Paxson Van Palin, was born in April this year. After his birth, she told reporters: \"I'm looking at him right now, and I see perfection. Yeah, he has an extra chromosome. I keep thinking, in our world, what is normal and what is perfect?\"</p> <p>Palin has a degree in journalism from the University of Idaho and worked in the media and the utilities industry before moving into politics 14 years ago.</p>",
  "<p>With the nomination of its governor, Sarah Palin, as the Republican vice-presidential candidate, the quiet state of Alaska is suddenly at the centre of media attention.</p> <p>The state likes to think of itself as the last frontier and prides itself on its natural beauty, particularly its mountain ranges with exotic names such as Talkeetna, Aleutian and Tordrillo.</p> <p>It boasts 100,000 glaciers, more than 600 of them named. The Malaspina glacier is larger than the small north-eastern US state of Rhode Island. Another, the Nebesna glacier, is 80 miles long. There are 17 national parks, and Wrangell-St Elias is America's largest at more than 13.2m acres.</p> <p>In a state that likes to crow about the biggest this and the highest that, it is fitting that the world's biggest salmon \u2013 97lb 4oz \u2013 and the world's biggest halibut \u2013 459lb - were caught in Alaska. </p> <p>The state's pristine wilderness explains the uproar that ensued when the Exxon Valdez tanker struck a reef and spilled millions of gallons into the Gulf of Alaska in one of America's largest environmental disasters.</p> <p>One of America's most protracted environmental battles happens to be raging in northern Alaska. Since 1977, environmentalists have been fighting the oil industry over whether there should be oil exploration in the <a href=\"http://arctic.fws.gov/\">Arctic National Wildlife Refuge</a>. </p> <p>George Bush tried unsuccessfully to overturn a ban on drilling in the refuge. Both presidential candidates, John McCain and Barack Obama, oppose oil exploration in the refuge. Obama, though, does support an Alaska natural gas pipeline.</p> <p>Politically, Alaska, which the US bought from Russia in 1876 for $7.2m, is a pygmy. Because of its tiny population of just over 670,000, the state has just three electoral votes \u2013 half the number of Delaware, home to Joe Biden, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate. Firmly in the Republican camp, Alaska last elected a Democrat to Congress in 1974. </p> <p>The last time Alaska went Democratic in a presidential election was in 1976, when Jimmy Carter won office. In the 2004 election, George Bush easily took Alaska, winning 61% of the vote while John Kerry took 36%.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337128463\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>Republican presidential nominee John McCain today selected Alaska governor Sarah Palin, a relative political novice, as his vice-presidential running mate. </p> <p>The move is a bold play for the potentially millions of disaffected Hillary Clinton supporters who yearn to vote for a woman candidate in the November election and who have remained impervious to Democratic pleas for party unity.</p> <p>McCain introduced Palin at a rally in Dayton, Ohio before a crowd of 15,000. He praised her as a woman of \"strong principles, fighting spirit and deep compassion\".</p> <p>\"She's got the grit, integrity, common sense and fierce devotion to the common good that is exactly what we need in Washington today,\" McCain said.</p> <p>Palin appeared confident and enthusiastic in her first appearance on the national stage. She took the podium alongside her husband Todd, a member of the steelworkers union, and said the two celebrate their 20th wedding anniversary today.</p> <p>\"I had promised my husband a little present for our anniversary, and I hope he can see I delivered,\" she said, to raucous laughter and cheers.</p> <p>She thanked McCain, and after a few words about herself turned her talk back to the senator.</p> <p>\"This is a moment when great causes can be won and great problems can be overcome,\" she said. \"In a dangerous world, it is John McCain who can lead America's friends and allies in preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.\"</p> <p>She was effusive in her praise for Hillary Clinton, claiming for herself the groundbreaking role Clinton played during the Democratic primary race. \"It turns out the women of America aren't finished yet,\" Palin said. \"We can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all.\"</p> <p>The announcement came the morning after Barack Obama's well-received address on the final day of the Democratic convention, a transparent effort to keep pundits from discussing Obama. </p> <p>Texas senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson, one of the senior women in the US Senate, praised Palin as \"a breath of fresh air\".</p> <p>\"They wanted to show that they are independent and that they are the agents of change and they have gone outside the [Washington area] to do it,\" she told MSNBC television. \"Of course there's a risk, and I think John McCain assessed that risk\".</p> <p>Conservative activists today applauded the pick.</p> <p>David Keene, chairman of the American conservative union, said the selection is \"great news for conservatives\".</p> <p>\"Her dedication to principle, her courage both before and after her election as governor of Alaska and her personal qualities make her a perfect choice for vice-president,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Any conservatives who have been lukewarm thus far in their support of the McCain candidacy will work their hearts out between now and November for the McCain-Palin ticket.\"</p> <p>The conservative Washington anti-tax group Club for Growth was quick to praise Palin, lauding her \"fiscal responsibility\" and opposition to the use of public money on a notorious bridge project in an empty quarter of Alaska.</p> <p>\"At a time when many Republicans are still clinging to pork-barrel politics, Governor Palin has quickly become a leader on this issue,\" said Club for Growth President Pat Toomey. \"She is a principled reformer who understands how badly wasteful spending has marred the Republican brand.\"</p> <p>Barack Obama spokesman Bill Burton mocked the selection and noted Palin's anti-abortion stance.</p> <p>\"Today, John McCain put the former mayor of a town of 9,000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency,\" he said. \"Governor Palin shares John McCain's commitment to overturning Roe v Wade, the agenda of big oil and continuing George Bush's failed economic policies - that's not the change we need, it's just more of the same\".</p> <p>Palin's selection is sure to excite the news media and thrill voters at the prospect that the next administration will feature either the first female vice-president or African-American president.</p> <p>As unexpected and unusual as Palin's selection is, she is not the first woman to stand for vice-president. That was Geraldine Ferraro, a New York congresswoman who in 1984 ran alongside Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale.</p> <p>Palin, 44, is Alaska's first female governor. She was sworn in December 2006, making her one of the least experienced people to run for vice-president in recent memory. Alaska is one of the smallest states in the US, with only 670,000 residents.</p> <p>Before becoming governor, Palin served two terms as mayor of Wasilla, Alaska, a town of 9,800 people, and was on the city's council before that. In the 2006 Alaska gubernatorial race, Palin bested the incumbent Republican governor during the primary election.</p> <p>In recent days, McCain personally interviewed Palin at his ranch in Sedona, Arizona.</p> <p>In selecting a decidedly unconventional running mate, McCain passed over establishment favourites Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney.</p> <p>Palin will have to face Democratic vice-presidential nominee Joe Biden in a televised debate September 2 in St Louis, Missouri. </p> <p>Biden, a Delaware senator, is known as a skilled and tactful debater, and is a foreign policy expert, chairing the Senate foreign relations committee. Obama announced his selection of Biden last weekend.</p> <p>The Democrats will raise questions whether Palin passes the \"commander-in-chief test\", that is, will Palin be able to assume the presidency should McCain, who has suffered skin cancer, become incapacitated. </p> <p>The announcement was eagerly anticipated among Republicans, who travel this weekend to St Paul, Minnesota, for their national convention, which kicks off on Monday. Palin is to address the convention on Wednesday, and will likely launch blistering attacks on Obama.</p> <p>Today is John McCain's 72nd birthday, and the youthful Palin is a welcome contrast. She is three years younger than Obama. In addition, she was a runner-up to the Miss Alaska beauty pageant.</p> <p>She would present a new face unfamiliar to most of the country and would stir up the race.</p> <p>Palin would be a youthful addition to the ticket. She brings several characteristics sure to encourage the Republican base, such as her opposition to abortion rights and her support of expanded drilling in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge.</p> <p>However, she also brings several risks. She has been in office less than two years, and will be hard pressed to go toe-to-toe in debate with Biden.</p> <p>The news media may also seek to tie Palin to longtime Alaska Republican senator Ted Stevens, who is soon to stand trial on corruption charges. </p> <p>In the Alaska capital, Juneau, Palin is under her own ethics cloud: The Alaska legislature is investigating whether Palin sacked a public safety commissioner who declined to fire a state trooper that was engaged in a custody battle with Palin's sister.</p>",
  "<p>One of the difficulties for an orator in addressing a stadium-size audience is the loss of the rapport that a more intimate crowd can have. A speech is a joint performance with the audience. Otherwise you could just text it.</p> <p>Talking to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.democrats20082\">80,000 people</a> affects the ability to adjust pacing for when the listeners are slow to get a point, or indeed respond more enthusiastically than planned to one, and there were occasions last night when Barack Obama seemed to be playing more by the metronome than the pheromones from the crowd.</p> <p>But that is minor quibble. His audience was in his hands, and it was a crowd of individuals. This was no rally of serried ranks of uniform supporters. As the camera played over the crowd, the diversity of the supporters reinforced the message of the vox pops that had introduced him. They had been working-class or middle-class people hurting, or perhaps equally worried about being hurt by a faltering economy and his populism without tub-thumping was aimed at them. There were suits and ties for the respectable, baseball caps and novelty sunglasses for the free of spirit, young, old, black, white, casual and formal, scattered indiscriminately across the stands. This was no Jesse Jackson rainbow of discreet hues. It was an integrated pointilliste picture of America.</p> <p>Obama gave the bravura performance on a tightrope, balancing the hopes and fears of his audiences masterfully. There were enough references to establish his blackness, as if giving <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.barackobama2\">the speech</a> on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/28/uselections2008.constitutionandcivilliberties\">anniversary of Martin Luther King's iconic speech</a> were not enough in itself. But consciously or otherwise, he eschewed the preacher-like cadences that come naturally and distinctively to black American politicians who switch effortlessly between pulpit and platform.</p> <p>Even so, his speech had the antiphony of genuine oratory. He was not reading out an op-ed. \"This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich. We have the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what makes us strong. Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores.\"</p> <p>Without talking down to his audience, or dumbing down his message, he used plain, direct language. I ran it through the spell checker, which, fallible though it may be, gave it a fourth-grade reading level with no passives, backing up my own impression. This was not a wonkish or \"elite\" speech, but it addressed the issues, concretely, active without being orotund. He also adroitly addressed the criticism, open and implied of voters who are not sure why someone of his complexion has stridden from the back of the bus to the driving seat. He was rightly indignant about the plight of ordinary Americans, without being \"angry\" in the way that codes for \"too black\" in the US.</p> <p>He effected a winning combination of altruism and self-interest, offering not just a dream but a plan, and a plan that addresses the hopes and fears of those white working-class voters. Even his criticisms of McCain were nuanced, substantial without being personal, and sharply witty without being snide: \"It's not because John McCain doesn't care. It's because John McCain doesn't get it.\"</p> <p>\"You know, John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the gates of hell, but he won't even follow him to the cave where he lives,\" Obama scored, putting a new wound in the Republican's achilles heel, the Iraq war. To a war-weary electorate he offered a renewed version of Teddy Roosevelt's soft talk/big stick formula, promising tough diplomacy and an efficient military.</p> <p>That will not stop the attacks of course. As Obama said: \"If you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters. If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from.\"</p> <p>Perhaps most impressive was the way that Obama prophylactically anticipated the coming flood of conservative vituperation, taking the attacks and deflecting them back onto the perpetrators with commonsense and wit. \"Don't tell me we can't uphold the second amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals.\" And the calls about lack of experience he countered neatly, suggesting, without naming McCain, that some people may have too much of it. \"I realise that I am not the likeliest candidate for this office. I don't fit the typical pedigree and I haven't spent my career in the halls of Washington.\"</p> <p>Without dignifying the absurd accusations of elitism and arrogance from sitting politicians and wallowing plutocrats, Obama encapsulates the portmanteau populism of his speech. \"History teaches us \u2013 that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington. Change comes to Washington.\"</p> <p>After the speech, it may just.</p>",
  "<p>I don't think the inexperience point should be the main one, actually. The McCain team will respond that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.johnmccain\">Sarah Palin</a> is practically as experienced as the Democratic nominee, and though that won't be true it'll get a lot of laughs and be effective.</p> <p>She is chiefly an ideological choice, so the main attacks should be ideological. It will take time to convince moderate voters that right-wing crazy people come in attractive, 44-year-old female Alaskan packages, but it can happen.</p> <p>On the merits, it must be said that this is a deeply irresponsible and unserious choice. Someone who's been governor of a small, remote and comparatively unimportant state for a year and a half is not in any way, shape or form the best possible choice he could have made. Democrats need to say that, too.</p>",
  "<p>I don't really know much yet. It would seem that the idea here is to nail down the base \u2013 Palin is quite right-wing \u2013 and pick up some Hillary voters.</p> <p>She's 44 years old. Is she ready to be president? John McCain is 72 and has cancer. I'm writing these words right as the news is breaking, around 8:40 am Rocky Mountain time, and the first question the yakkers are raising is what we call here the so-called heartbeat-away question. She was a mayor of a town in Alaska with a population of 8,000 just three years ago.</p> <p>Also she's going to be debating Joe Biden. I think he'll mop the floor with her, provided he isn't overconfident.</p> <p>Pat Buchanan just said: \"I think this is the biggest political gamble, just about, in all of American history.\" He's talking up her right-wing credentials now. So McCain still feels he needs to nail down the base. They may think they can get some Hillary voters because Palin is an attractive woman, and it may be that they will. But I would think that once Hillary voters know her right-wing politics, the vast majority will steer clear.</p> <p>Final thought: The cables are going to be showing clips of Dan Quayle. Is that what the McCain team wants?</p>",
  "<p>Picking the Alaska governor is a bold play from John McCain for the potentially millions of disaffected Hillary Clinton voters who have remained impervious to Democrats' pleas for party unity. She presents a new face unfamiliar to most of America, and is likely to stir up the race and excite the news media. </p> <p>At 44, she is a youthful addition to the Republican ticket. Palin is an avid fisher and hunter, a member of the politically powerful National Rifle Association, and her husband has native-American roots.</p> <p>But Palin brings several risks. She has been in office less than two years, and would be hard pressed to go toe-to-toe in debate with Democratic vice-presidential nominee Joe Biden, a veteran senator and foreign policy expert. </p> <p>The Democrats will also raise questions about whether Palin passes the \"commander-in-chief test\" - that is, would she be able to assume the presidency should McCain, 72, become incapacitated. The news media may also seek to tie Palin to longtime Alaska Republican senator Ted Stevens, who is under indictment on corruption charges.</p> <p>Before taking office in December 2006, Palin served two terms as mayor of Wasilla, Alaska, and was on the city's council before that.</p> <h2>The others on McCain's shortlist</h2> <p><strong>Mitt Romney</strong></p> <p>If Mitt Romney had been picked, it would have been akin to Barack Obama choosing Hillary Clinton for his running mate. Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, was McCain's chief rival for the Republican nomination, and as such spent several months savaging the Arizona senator in debates and in the press. </p> <p>The scion of a prominent Michigan political family \u2013 his father was governor of the state \u2013 Romney spent his early adulthood as a Mormon missionary in France. He was praised for his management of the 2002 winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, and grew extremely wealthy as a venture capitalist. Elected governor of Massachusetts in 2002, he governed as a moderate \u2013 necessary in that liberal state.</p> <p>Romney is acclaimed for his business acumen and can speak fluently on the economy \u2013 an admitted weakness for McCain. </p> <p>But in the wake of McCain's \"houses\" gaffe \u2013 the senator was unable to tell a reporter how many homes he and his wife, heiress to a beer distributing company, own \u2013 the Republican party may have been reluctant to present a ticket made up of two extremely wealthy men. </p> <p><strong>Tim Pawlenty</strong></p> <p>Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty's staid reputation and uncharismatic manner mask a self-deprecating sense of humour: in spring, he praised his wife's willingness to watch hockey games with him, but said: \"Now, if I could only get her to have sex with me.\"</p> <p>Crass jokes aside, Pawlenty potentially brought many attributes favourable among the Republican base: long-time attendance at an evangelical church, consistent conservative stances on social issues, and opposition to tax increases. He also has the blue-collar background much sought after among American politicians. That presents a marked contrast to McCain, the son and grandson of admirals. </p> <p>Some Republicans had hoped that having Pawlenty on the ticket could have put his state in play. Minnesota has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate in recent memory, but in 2004 chose Democrat John Kerry by 51% to 48%. </p> <p>But while Pawlenty was first elected governor in 2002, he won re-election in 2006 by a narrow margin, leading national Republicans to question his popularity in his home state. Also, he was an unproven debater, while Joe Biden, Barack Obama's running mate, is skilled and experienced.</p> <p><strong>Joseph Lieberman</strong></p> <p>This Connecticut senator - a career-long Democrat who split with the party in 2006 over the Iraq war - was spoken of with some seriousness as a possible McCain running mate. Lieberman and McCain enjoy a friendly personal relationship and the two have travelled together extensively. </p> <p>He is well used to the rigours of a vice-presidential campaign, having run alongside Democrat Al Gore in 2000 and come within a hair's breadth of the White House. </p> <p>But he brought several major drawbacks. For one, many Republicans simply would not have trusted or been enthusiastic about having a former Democrat on the ticket. An independent senator, Lieberman votes with the Democrats on most issues and has amassed a moderate voting record. Also, he is a supporter of abortion rights, and is an orthodox Jew, both sure to have troubled socially conservative voters. It was also unlikely that Lieberman could have delivered his home state for the Republicans. </p> <p><strong>Eric Cantor</strong></p> <p>This young Virginia congressman took part in early August in a conference call with reporters to attack Barack Obama's energy plan, leading to speculation that he was auditioning to be McCain's running mate.</p> <p><strong>Tom Ridge</strong></p> <p>The former Pennsylvania governor and the first secretary of homeland security under George Bush was able to claim national security credentials. But as a supporter of abortion rights, conservative leaders warned that Ridge having on the ticket could have been disastrous for McCain's chances, as anti-abortion Republicans would have been inclined to stay at home instead of rallying for the candidate.</p>",
  "<p>How effective was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.democrats20082\">Barack Obama's acceptance speech</a>? One way of measuring it is by taking the temperature of the commentariat. Whereas liberal pundits praised Obama for emphasising substance over style, and for directly challenging John McCain, conservatives largely chose to gloss over the address and instead attack Obama himself.</p> <p>\"On the 45th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr's 'I Have a Dream' speech, Barack Obama answered back tonight with a simple, 'I Have a Plan',\" <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/blogs/xxfactor/archive/2008/08/28/i-have-a-plan.aspx\">enthused Dahlia Lithwick</a> of the liberal webzine Slate, who called Obama's speech a \"point-by-point refutation of the claim that the man is all empty talk\".</p> <p>By contrast, Ramesh Ponnuru, writing for the conservative National Review, <a href=\"http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MDMxNjFiNDQ4NTNlYTM4MjUyNzc4NjZiOTllN2NmN2E=\">sought to draw a distinction</a> between Obama the performer and Obama the person.</p> <p>\"Everyone knew that Barack Obama can give a good speech, and he did just that tonight. The Obama we heard from was an attractive figure. Too bad he doesn't exist,\" wrote Ponnuru, who then proceeded to criticise him for his ties to the Rev Jeremiah Wright and former radical activist William Ayers, his support for \"taxpayer-funded abortion\" and driving licenses for illegal immigrants, and his votes against military spending.</p> <p>Washington Post conservative columnist <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/28/AR2008082802852.html\">Charles Krauthammer went one better</a>, calling Obama \"the ultimate self-made man, a dazzling mysterious Gatsby\". He didn't mean it in a good way.</p> <p>For all the summer angst among Democrats over their fears that the Republicans were turning Obama's skills against him, last night was a reminder that the candidate's eloquence - though insufficient by itself - brings a level of transcendence to this campaign with few recent historical parallels.</p> <p>John Kennedy and Ronald Reagan were good, but not this good. Bill Clinton, as he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/28/uselections2008.democrats20084\">showed again this week</a>, is unequalled in his ability to explain complex issues in human terms, and Obama could learn a few things from him. But Obama's soaring rhetoric - even if it wasn't on full display last night - comes from a different place, more Martin Luther King than anything so crass as politics.</p> <p>Terence Samuel of the Root, a webzine targeted at African-Americans, was <a href=\"http://www.theroot.com/id/47853\">moved by the historical importance</a> of Obama's nomination, which took place not in some <a href=\"http://www.gop.com/news/NewsRead.aspx?Guid=a86a28d8-1183-46a6-b74f-8a6462ce25a8\">\"Temple of Obama\"</a>, as the Republicans would have it, but in front of a set designed to evoke <a href=\"http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mlkihaveadream.htm\">King's 1963 speech</a> before the Lincoln Memorial. Samuel wrote: \"There was no escaping the emotional power of watching Obama, a black man with a name that does not flow easily from the American tongue, step forward to stand center stage of history. Tears were not an uncommon sight during the speech.\"</p> <p>Mainstream analysis today is not quite so full-throated, but the consensus seems pretty clear that Obama's speech was, at the very least, a political success. Patrick Healy of the New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/29/us/politics/29assess.html?ex=1377748800&amp;en=635c01aa6dfc6221&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink\">wrote</a> that Obama \"unquestionably confronted two of his greatest challenges\", which he defined as fleshing out his rhetoric with specific policy proposals and taking on McCain. In the Washington Post, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/29/AR2008082900104.html?hpid%3Dtopnews&amp;sub=AR\">Dan Balz called the speech</a> \"a forceful challenge to John McCain and the Republicans, and a restatement of the message to change Washington and the nation that propelled him to the nomination.\"</p> <p>New York's tabloids, which rarely pass up an occasion to snark, both played it straight and gave Obama his due, running huge photos of the candidate smiling and waving. \"HIS NIGHT\", proclaimed the <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com\">Daily News</a>, while <a href=\"http://www.nypost.com\">Rupert Murdoch's Post</a> went with an even more evocative \"THE DREAM LIVES\".</p> <p>Conservative commentator Peggy Noonan, showing her background as a long-time Republican speechwriter, couldn't help but admire Obama's craftsmanship, <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121998875327382805.html?mod=todays_columnists\">writing in the Wall Street Journal</a> (Murdoch again, don't you know): \"The speech itself lacked lift but had heft. It wasn't precisely long on hope, but I think it showed audacity.\" Noonan, though, also called the speech a \"gamble\" because of Obama's \"stern\" and \"indignant\" tone.</p> <p>Noonan may be on to something. For long stretches, Obama was uncharacteristically harsh and negative. His partisans surely enjoyed the red meat he tossed to the crowd. But, historically, the electorate is more likely to reward sunny optimism. That, after all, was the secret to Reagan's success.</p> <p>Still, the \"gamble\" to which Noonan refers may not be all that much of a risk. According to <a href=\"http://www.pollingreport.com/right.htm\">the latest CNN/Opinion Research poll</a>, 69% of those surveyed believe things in the country are going \"pretty badly\" or \"very badly\". Reagan was always able to put a shine on numbers like that, but he was unique. McCain's 2008 persona is dour bordering on nasty, and his <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1836909,00.html\">weirdly hostile interview with Time magazine</a> shows he's not exactly putting a premium on being charming with the press. Perhaps his decade-long <a href=\"http://www.bostonphoenix.com/archive/features/00/02/17/DON_T_QUOTE_ME.html\">honeymoon with the media</a> is finally coming to an end.</p> <p>\"Obama proved tonight - again - that he's one of the few most gifted public communicators of the last generation,\" <a href=\"http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/08/obamas_speech_heavy_in_specifi.php\">wrote Greg Sargent</a> for TPM Election Central. \"But this time, he proved it by not excelling in soaring rhetoric or delivering a speech that will be remembered for the ages. Rather, he recognised that tonight's speech didn't have to be an effort to join the Rhetorical Hall of Fame.\"</p> <p>My guess is that the public will reward Obama with some of his best numbers since last winter. The Gallup daily tracking poll had him<a href=\"http://medianation.blogspot.com/2008/08/moving-on-up.html\"> moving up smartly </a>after just the first two days of the convention. The reaction to his acceptance speech won't be reflected in the results until this weekend.</p> <p>The big question now is whether McCain can have a successful enough week that we're all even again by the time the two conventions are over. Maybe he can. But based on the media reaction, and what we all saw and heard, Obama set a very high standard for McCain to match.</p>",
  "<p>Russia bitterly accused the west of \"bias\" and \"double standards\" today, following international criticism of its actions in Georgia, and amid signs that the European Union is backing away from sanctions against Moscow.</p> <p>Russia's foreign ministry said it rejected criticism from the G7 group of industrialised countries. They had condemned its invasion of Georgia, and its recognition on Tuesday of the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.</p> <p>\"This step is biased and aimed at justifying the aggressive actions of Georgia,\" the ministry said, adding that the G7 \u2014 which includes Britain, France, Germany, the US, Italy, Japan and Canada \u2014 had made \"baseless assertions about Russia undermining Georgia's territorial integrity.\"</p> <p>Russia's foreign ministry spokesman, Andrey Nesterenko, went further. He lambasted Nato for \"putting pressure\" on Russia and said that there could be \"irreversible consequences\" for stability in Europe. Nato had no \"moral right to lecture Russia,\" he added.</p> <p>The Kremlin's defiant and unapologetic tone comes ahead of a special EU summit in Brussels on Monday, called by France, to discuss the EU's future relations with Russia. On Thursday, France's foreign minister, Bernard Coucher, intimated that sanctions against Moscow would be discussed.</p> <p>Yesterday, though, the EU appeared to be rapidly retreating from this position.</p> <p>Moscow has made clear it will respond to any punitive measures from Brussels, which could include the suspension of a new EU-Russia partnership agreement. \"The time to pass sanctions has certainly not come,\" said a senior diplomat from France, which holds the EU presidency.</p> <p>Analysts in Moscow today said that Russia's leadership was relatively relaxed about the threat of EU sanctions. \"I don't think the contemporary west has any means to punish a state that is not quite a rogue state,\" Yulia Latynina, a commentator with the independent Echo of Moscow radio station told the Guardian.</p> <p>She went on: \"The Kremlin didn't take Tbilisi and didn't shoot (Mikheil) Saakashvili.

The war was quite brilliant in its design.\"</p> <p>Other analysts said they didn't expect Russia to reverse its recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, despite the prospect of international isolation. So far only Belarus had said it will join Russia in recognising Georgia's breakaway states.</p> <p>\"I think they are watching very closely to see what will happen at the EU summit on Monday,\" Grigorii V Golosov, professor at the faculty of political sciences, at the European University of St Petersburg, said. \"But I think the Kremlin calculation is that the EU won't react seriously.\"</p> <p>Putin's interview with CNN on Thursday \u2014 in which he blamed the war in Georgia on a plot by Washington to propel John McCain into the White House \u2014 was a deliberate tactic, Golosov said. Putin's aim was to promote divisions between the EU and Washington, he added. \"This is the old game of the Russian leadership,\" Golosov remarked.</p> <p>Yesterday Igor Sechin, Russia's deputy prime minister, dismissed a report in the Daily Telegraph that Moscow was preparing to cut oil deliveries to western European. The claims were \"nothing but an invention and a gross provocation,\" Sechin said, adding that such a move would hurt Russian firms.</p> <p>South Ossetian leaders, meanwhile, yesterday said they expected Moscow to eventually absorb the province into the Russian Federation. Russia's president Dmitry Medvedev and the region's pro-Moscow leader Eduard Kokoity held talks on the province's future status this week, said the South Ossetian parliamentary speaker, Znaur Gassiyev.</p> <p>Russia will absorb South Ossetia \"in several years\" or earlier, a position that was \"firmly stated by both leaders\", Gassiyev admitted. South Ossetia is expected to sign a treaty on Tuesday allowing Russia to station military bases on the territory.</p>",

  "<p>As expected, everyone in Washington with a pulse and a press spokesman released a statement either praising or attacking John McCain's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.johnmccain1\">pick</a> of Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as his vice-presidential running mate.</p> <p>Note how the Democrats leap to mention that today is McCain's 72nd birthday.</p> <p>Read a selection of the statements after the jump:</p> <p>President Bush called the pick exciting, and said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Governor Palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government. Governor Palin's success is due to her dedication to principle and her roll-up-your-sleeves work ethic and serves as a wonderful example of the spirit of America. By selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done, Senator McCain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming Washington.</p> <p>I applaud Senator McCain for selecting Governor Palin. This decision is yet another example of why the American people can trust him to make wise decisions and to confidently lead this country.</p> </blockquote> <p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, a Democrat, said:</p> <blockquote> <p>The selection of a vice presidential candidate is one of the most significant and telling decisions a presidential candidate can make. John McCain's selection of Sarah Palin raises serious questions about his judgment. Why, when the country is fighting two wars, facing an uncertain economy and an energy crisis, did Senator McCain make the choice that he did? Why, with so many other qualified women and men in his party, did John McCain choose Sarah Palin? Sarah Palin is not the right choice. She shares John McCain's commitment to overturning Roe v. Wade and continuing George Bush's failed economic policies.</p> <p>John McCain and Sarah Palin will not bring the American people the New Direction they need.</p> </blockquote> <p>Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, erstwhile rival for the GOP nomination and more recently a short-lister for the veep pick himself said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Governor Palin's story is one that all Americans will find inspiring. She's a Washington outsider with a commitment to the conservative principles that will make our nation stronger. I look forward to campaigning for Senator McCain, Governor Palin and Republicans all across the country.</p> </blockquote> <p>Democratic California Senator Barbara Boxer said:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Vice President is a heartbeat away from becoming President, so to choose someone with not one hour's worth of experience on national issues is a dangerous choice. If John McCain thought that choosing Sarah Palin would attract Hillary Clinton voters, he is badly mistaken. The only similarity between her and Hillary Clinton is that they are both women. On the issues, they could not be further apart. Senator McCain had so many other options if he wanted to put a women on his ticket, such as Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison or Senator Olympia Snowe - they would have been an appropriate choice compared to this dangerous choice.</p> </blockquote> <p>Representative Chris Van Hollen, chairman of the Democratic congressional campaign committee, which is charged with electing Dems to the US House, offers this backhanded compliment:</p> <blockquote> <p>Sarah Pallin is an intelligent, well regarded governor of two years and was the mayor of a town of 9,000. However, Senator John McCain has made his candidacy about a single argument - experience and Sarah Pallin doesn't have it. On his birthday, Senator McCain chose a running mate who simply has no track record of exercising good judgment on national security and foreign policy issues to be one heart beat away from the presidency.</p> </blockquote> <p>Republican party chairman Mike Duncan said:</p> <blockquote> <p>I applaud John McCain's selection of Governor Sarah Palin, whose commitment to reform and record of bipartisanship is exactly what our country needs. I am confident that this team will continue to keep America safe and make our nation more prosperous.</p> </blockquote> <p>Representative Rahm Emanuel, Democratic party hatchet-man, said:</p> <blockquote> <p>After trying to make experience the issue of this campaign, John McCain celebrated his 72nd birthday by appointing a former small town mayor and brand new Governor as his Vice Presidential nominee. Is this really who the Republican Party wants to be one heartbeat away from the Presidency? Given Sarah Palin's lack of experience on every front and on nearly every issue, this Vice Presidential pick doesn't show judgement: it shows political panic.</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>Barack Obama's speech at Denver's Mile High stadium last night was widely praised for its eloquence in laying out some of his campaign themes, and for its aggression in taking on his Republican opponent, John McCain. </p> <p>Delivered before an audience of more than 80,000 people, the address was the marquee event of the Democratic convention and, as such, was about twice the length of keynote speeches given previously during the four-day event. </p> <p>Guardian America analysed the speech by counting the number of times key words were uttered, to reveal some of the underlying trends. One statistic stands out: Obama referred to himself roughly half as many times again (92) as he referred to his audience (65), while Bill Clinton on Wednesday night referred to himself four times as often (16) as he did to his audience (4).</p> <p>\"What the nay-sayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me,\" Obama said last night, answering Republican attacks that he is self-absorbed. \"It's been about you.\"</p> <p><strong>Total words: 4,786</strong></p> <p>America and American: 52<br>Democrat or Democratic: 9<br>Republican: 7<br>McCain: 21<br>Bush: 8<br>Hillary: 1<br>Clinton: 3<br>Biden: 9<br>I, my, me, mine: 92<br>You/your: 65</p> <p>God: 2<br>Hope: 4<br>Promise: 32<br>Iraq: 7<br>Iran: 2<br>Afghanistan: 3<br>War: 9<br>Women: 5<br>Economy/economic: 12<br>Jobs: 8<br>Health/healthcare: 6<br>Child/children: 10</p>",
  "<p>As a rule, the American press loved <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.barackobama2\">Barack Obama's address</a> to the Democratic national convention on Thursday night. On MSNBC, popular host Keith Olbermann kicked off the post speech conversation by opining: \"We can take pride that this nation can produce men and speakers such as that.\" He likened the speech to the lame Rob Reiner-Aaron Sorkin flick <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112346/\">The American President</a> but said the \"cut the crap moment[s]\" from the Obama speech were \"not the stuff of fiction.\"</p> <p>Olbermann then said that he would \"love to find something to criticise\" about the speech and asked colleague Chris Matthews, \"Got anything?\" \"No,\" said Matthews, before piling on praise of his own. For the next 20 minutes at least, the cable network's coverage played like a vicious parody of soppy-headed liberal boosterism. One guest interviewed by Matthews, an African American pundette, said she'd had to go have herself a good cry before she was ready to appear on air.</p> <p>Why were they were so <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.democrats20081\">turned on by Obama's oration</a>? Because he put forward a liberalism that was patriotic yet pluralistic, tough yet compassionate, confrontational yet thoughtful, full yet empty. It was made-for-cable catnip.</p> <p>Obama looked at the last four years and yelled \"Enough!\" He promised to end the war in Iraq but to do so \"responsibly.\" He promised new taxes for increases in the government provision of education and healthcare while at the same time ensuring that a nebulous \"95 percent of working families\" would pay no more in tax, and that many would pay less.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://elections.foxnews.com/2008/08/28/obama-accepts-nomination-calls-on-voters-to-revive-american-promise/\">newly-minted Democratic nominee</a> relented from his former opposition to offshore oil exploration and drilling but said that this was only a \"stop gap measure\" to supplement his otherwise green energy policies. On two hot button domestic policies, he said that he thought pro-lifers and pro-choicers could agree on policies to \"reduce unwanted pregnancies\" and he badly caricatured the gun debate like so: \"Don't tell me we can't uphold the second amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals.\"</p> <p>He both defended and attacked John McCain. Obama thanked the former prisoner of war for his service to country but insisted that he is a Washington insider who is out of touch on several fronts. He said that the wealthy Republican does not know what it's like out there for suffering workers. And in the best if not entirely accurate line of the night, Obama said McCain \"stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end the Iraq war.\"</p> <p>It was not a bad speech by the low standards of modern American rhetoric, so maybe we should cut some slack to those media figures who got caught up in the spectacle. After all, it did take place not in a convention hall but in the packed-to-capacity Invesco Field in Denver. The crowd was waving American flags and \"change\" signs and chanting \"Yes we can!\" There was a fireworks display and confetti with enough red, white, and blue streamers that it looked like the stage had been silly stringed.</p> <p>But what's Obama's excuse for slacking off? This address was not nearly as good as his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWynt87PaJ0\">keynote speech at the 2004 Democratic convention</a>. His lines this time ran from serviceable to pretty awful. A supposed hard truth that he told to Democrats was \"We can not meet twenty first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy.\" It sounded like something Al Gore would have said, circa 1995.</p> <p>Or how about this one: \"If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next commander-in-chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have.\" Not, \"McCain's judgment is deficient.\" Not, \"His temperament is dangerous and will lead us over a cliff.\" Rather, Obama prissily informed us that he's \"ready to have\" that debate about all this. With all due respect, no he's not.</p>",
  "<p>Opposition to Russia's recognition of the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia has been almost universal, even among its friends and allies. The G7 nations have accused Moscow of breaking international law. The EU is considering sanctions. And, most significantly, China has failed to endorse Russia's actions.</p> <h2>What are the Chinese saying and why?</h2> <p>At the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Tajikistan, which brought together Russia, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, a final statement gave the Kremlin little comfort: \"We express grave concern in connection with the recent tensions around the South Ossetian issue and urge the sides to solve existing problems peacefully, through dialogue, and to make efforts facilitating reconciliation and talks.\"</p> <p>Analysts say China wants to avoid any anti-western gestures and, with its own restive ethnic minorities, showing any support for separatism.</p> <h2>How has Russia reacted to the criticism?</h2> <p>Defiantly. The prime minister, Vladimir Putin, went on CNN to accuse the US of provoking the conflict by arming the Georgian army, and suggested that this was part of an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/russia.georgia\">election ploy</a> to help the Republican presidential candidate, John McCain, in his campaign for the White House. \"Russia does not feel isolated and is not afraid to be isolated,\" said the Russian ambassador in Brussels.</p> <h2>What could happen next?</h2> <p>The first significant development will be at the emergency summit of the EU on Monday, when discussion of sanctions will be on the table. These could include a visa ban on officials from the breakaway regions, a ban on Russian property investment in Europe or the postponement of new partnership accord talks between Moscow and the EU, which are scheduled for September 15. </p> <h2>Will the EU go that far?</h2> <p>While some of the former Soviet countries have pushed for a firm response, others such as Germany, Italy and France \u2013 which brokered the peace plan \u2013 want to keep lines of communication open and constructive. There will be more condemnation of Russia's \"illegitimate\" action and moves to provide humanitarian aid to Georgia. </p> <h2>What of the speech by the British foreign secretary, David Miliband, in Ukraine about building a \"coalition against Russian aggression\"?</h2> <p>It has not been well received, particularly because many Ukrainians have no wish to join Nato. They do want to join the EU, which has yet to give a pledge of future membership. The Financial Times commented in an <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f4a72d5e-752e-11dd-ab30-0000779fd18c.html\">editorial</a> today: \"Brussels must now summon up the courage to offer a positive response.\"</p>",
  "<p>After the interminable build-up, it would have been rude for Barack Obama not to deliver.

The McCain campaign set Obama up as a celebrity airhead, a Paris Hilton of wealth and elitism. And he let them portray him that way, and let them over-reach, and let them punch him again and again ... and then he turned around and destroyed them. If the Rove Republicans thought they were playing with a patsy, they just got a reality check.</p> </blockquote> <p>For John Judis, on The New Republic, Obama achieved everything necessary: </p> <blockquote> <p>He had to do three things for the fall, which he accomplished in his speech: first, he focused the campaign on the economy - and did so by personalizing the fear and anger that many Americans now feel. Secondly, he answered forcefully arguments about his ability as commander-in-chief. And third, he invoked his own biography to dispel fears that as a president he would favor one group over another.</p> </blockquote> <p>Slate dubbed it his I Have a Plan speech, in deference to Martin Luther King's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbUtL_0vAJk\">I Have a Dream</a> speech, made exactly 45 years ago. </p> <p>But even if many felt that Obama, out of necessity, adopted a more workmanlike tone, that did not stop some writers employing the emotional flourishes that the man himself is associated with.</p> <p><a href=\" http://www.slate.com/id/2198848/\">John Dickerson writes</a>: </p> <blockquote> <p>When he finished speaking, I looked at the faces around me. From an older African-American woman to a young father to a middle-aged woman, the tears were either in their eyes or rolling down their cheeks. A couple nearby kissed when the speech was over.</p> </blockquote> <p>While on his Salon blog, <a href=\"http://open.salon.com/content.php?cid=13271\">Dan Conley effuses</a>: </p> <blockquote> <p>Barack Obama has always been a soaring orator, but tonight be became both a political warrior and someone Americans can see as their next president.</p> </blockquote> <p>One of the few dissenting voices comes from Charles Babington, of <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/nation/27643279.html\">The Associated Press</a>, who writes: </p> <blockquote> <p>Instead of dwelling on specifics, he laced the crowning speech of his long campaign with the type of rhetorical flourishes that Republicans mock and the attacks on John McCain that Democrats cheer.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Sam Boyd on the American Post, is <a href=\"http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/tapped_archive?month=08&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=great_speech_terrible_ap_cover\">affronted by the temerity of the Associated Press</a>, in criticising Obama: </p> <blockquote> <p>The entire \"analysis\" is completely nonsensical, but seems designed to leave a casual reader with an impression that Obama lacked substance.

  "<p>There are some countries whose reality is distorted by sections of the media. And some about which straightforward lies are written. My first trip to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/28/livingstone.venezuela\">Caracas</a> revealed Venezuela to be firmly in the second category.</p> <p>The idea that this country is a <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-ed-venezuela28nov28,0,3333340.story?coll=la-opinion-leftrail\">dictatorship</a> is ridiculous \u2013 probably some of those assiduously promoting it have difficulty in keeping a straight face. Some \"dictatorship\" where the president <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/americas/12/03/venezuela.referendum/\">accepts the loss of a referendum</a> to change the constitution, which holds more national elections than virtually any other country in the world, and where walls and lamp-posts in areas of Caracas are vividly festooned with posters of anti-Ch\u00e1vez candidates. No, a dictatorship is a country like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/oct/29/saudiarabia.uk\">Saudi Arabia</a> \u2013 whose leader is of course officially feted on visits to London.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/28/livingstone.venezuela?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=networkfront\">Attending</a> a meeting with pro-Ch\u00e1vez candidates for the forthcoming local government elections in the capital, there was very definitely no certainty of success \u2013 as with the recent constitutional referendum, defeat was possible. The discussion, as with any local election in Britain, was how to address practical issues affecting peoples' quality of life.</p> <p>Caracas showed visibly the problems the country faces and progress made in recent years. In west central districts the houses of the old elite and upper-middle class are better than the most upmarket London suburb. They are surrounded by several million people living in poverty in \"barrios\" \u2013 rough-built slums perched on the side of mountains without basic facilities. These areas were not even marked on the maps under previous administrations!</p> <p>This is the product of a system where tens of billions of dollars of oil wealth each year were sent abroad to serve this elite without addressing the most elementary questions of quality of life of the majority of people.</p> <p>That has changed. A trip to one of many new community facilities showed how millions of people have been given access to a new free healthcare system, including dentistry. <a href=\"http://www.rethinkvenezuela.com/downloads/literacy.htm\">Illiteracy</a> has been eliminated to Unesco standards. Further education is being rapidly expanded.</p> <p>A top priority now is to transform the basic infrastructure throughout the city. So that, as mayoral candidates put it to me, people feel like citizens with a stake in their neighbourhoods.</p> <p>The keys are reducing crime and transforming the city's economic efficiency and quality of life.</p> <p>A remarkable programme of expansion of tube and rail lines in poor areas has begun. Alongside this it is necessary to tackle congestion, improve bus services, develop community policing, tackle waste and environmental protection.</p> <p>Venezuela always had the resources, and now has the political will, to begin to raise its cities to world-class standards. But it needs expertise to do this effectively and rapidly.</p> <p>That is where London's experience helps. Between 2000 and 2008 London was recognised as the most successful city of its size in world and transformed its bus services, put the police back into local communities, tackled traffic congestion and won the Olympics.</p> <p>That experience is now sought by very many other cities \u2013 including Caracas. It is why President Ch\u00e1vez invited me to Venezuela and why, together with other cities, I am pleased to continue the programme of advice and discussion between London and Venezuela.</p>",
  "<p>On a warm evening in Denver, 45 years to the day since Martin Luther King delivered his I Have A Dream speech, Barack Obama accepted the Democratic presidential nomination before a crowd of almost 80,000 people, telling them: \"America, we cannot turn back. Not with so much work to be done.\" And yet despite the drama of the occasion - the vast stadium in which he delivered the speech, the firework display, the elated and weeping onlookers - Obama's task was to talk policy: to demonstrate that there was substance behind the rhetoric. As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.democrats20082\">Ewen MacAskill and Suzanne Goldenberg write today's on Guardian.co.uk</a>, Obama allied his soaring oratory to long passages on how he would deal with America's ailing economy, offering a programme of education, health and energy reforms, allied to job creation and tax cuts. </p> <p>Answering supporters who had bemoaned his apparent unwillingness to make tough criticisms of George Bush and John McCain, he launched stinging attacks on both, telling spectators: \"America, we are better than these last eight years. We are a better country than this ... Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land - enough!\"</p> <p>It had been rumoured that John McCain would seek to steal some of Obama's thunder by announcing his vice-presidential pick just before the speech; later, it was reported that he planned to release a television ad last night that would seek to undermine his rival. Instead, he made no VP announcement \u2014 he's expected to do so today \u2014 and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.johnmccain\">the message of the ad turned out to be rather different</a>.\"Senator Obama, this is truly a good day for America,\" he is shown saying. \"Too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed. So I wanted to stop and say, congratulations. How perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day. Tomorrow, we'll be back at it. But tonight, Senator, job well done.\" </p> <h2>Next week: the Republicans in Minnesota, or not</h2> <p>McCain's party is due to hold its nomination gathering in St Paul, Minnesota, next week, in a four-day event that will include an awkward appearance by George Bush. But yesterday the McCain campaign unexpectedly announced that they were considering postponing the convention because of Tropical Storm Gustav, which is approaching hurricane strength as it nears America's Gulf Coast. The reason, essentially, is public relations: images of Republicans celebrating while storms ravaged New Orleans and environs would be disastrous for McCain.</p> <h2>On theguardian.com now</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/aug/29/barack.obama.acceptance.speech\">Video: Obama says it is 'time to change America'</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/aug/29/barackobama.democrats2008\">Michael Tomasky: Just the right speech</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.democrats20083\">Carnival spirit in Mile High Stadium</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2008/aug/28/uselections2008.barackobama?picture=337053946\">In pictures: The last day of the convention</a><br><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.barackobama\">Oliver Burkeman's Denver speech liveblog</a></p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0Fru4dZLGA\">MSNBC: Conservative commentator Pat Buchanan reads out - to cheers - his favourite Obama quote</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/29/us/politics/29dems.html?hp\">New York Times: Obama takes aim at Bush and McCain with forceful call to change</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/28/AR2008082802853.html\">Washington Post: So many miles from Selma</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-bertha29-2008aug29,0,915235.story\">LA Times: 88-year-old civil rights activist watches Obama speech</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/blogs/xxfactor/archive/2008/08/28/i-have-a-plan.aspx\">Slate: Obama gives his I Have A Plan speech</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.campaignsandelections.com/stories/?StoryID=0CED766B-1422-17E0-F8E222CAF01C0F93\">Campaigns and Elections: Two speechwriters, two views on Obama's speech</a></p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>Obama received a small but significant \"convention bounce\", according to Gallup's daily tracking poll, which gave the Illinois senator 48% to John McCain's 42%. But there was no similar bounce in Rasmussen's similar tracking poll, and Democratic insiders continue to voice worries at Obama's failure to pull decisively ahead.</p> <h2>Quote of the day I</h2> <p>\"For 18 long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past. You understand that in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result. You have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington. Change comes to Washington\" \u2014 Barack Obama, winning the adoration of his party. Now he just has to win the election.</p> <h2>Quote of the day II</h2> <p>\"We need a president who puts Barney Smith before Smith Barney\" \u2014 factory worker Barney Smith, chosen not exactly randomly to address the convention, presumably because Stanley Morgan was unavailable.</p> <h2>Scientific finding of the day</h2> <p>\"Sex wanted\" ads on the Denver version of the classifieds website Craigslist increased by more than 70% during the Democratic convention by comparison with this time last year, a study by the website CNET found. One desperate Obama supporter, meanwhile, used the website to offer a kidney in return for tickets for himself and his girlfriend.</p>",
  "<h2><a name=\"mccain\">On John McCain</a></h2> <p>Now let there be no doubt. The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect. And next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need.</p> <p>But the record's clear: John McCain has voted with George Bush 90% of the time. Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than 90% of the time? I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a 10% chance on change.</p> <p>The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on healthcare and education and the economy - Senator McCain has been anything but independent. He said that our economy has made \"great progress\" under this president. He said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong. And when one of his chief advisers - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a \"mental recession,\" and that we've become, and I quote, \"a nation of whiners\".</p> <p>A nation of whiners? Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made. Tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty. These are not whiners. They work hard and give back and keep going without complaint. These are the Americans that I know.</p> <p>Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans. I just think he doesn't know. Why else would he define middle class as someone making under $5m a year? How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than 100 million Americans? How else could he offer a healthcare plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatise social security and gamble your retirement?</p> <p>It's not because John McCain doesn't care. It's because John McCain doesn't get it.</p> <p>For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy - give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else. In Washington, they call this the ownership society, but what it really means is - you're on your own. Out of work? Tough luck. No healthcare? The market will fix it. Born into poverty? Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps - even if you don't have boots. You're on your own.</p> <p>Well it's time for them to own their failure. It's time for us to change America.</p> <h2><a name=\"foreignpolicy\">On foreign policy</a></h2> <p>If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next commander-in-chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have.</p> <p>For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face. When John McCain said we could just \"muddle through\" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights. John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the gates of hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives.</p> <p>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government, and even the Bush administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79bn surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.</p> <p>That's not the judgment we need. That won't keep America safe. We need a president who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past.</p> <p>You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in 80 countries by occupying Iraq. You don't protect Israel and deter Iran just by talking tough in Washington. You can't truly stand up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances. If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need.</p> <p>We are the party of Roosevelt. We are the party of Kennedy. So don't tell me that Democrats won't defend this country. Don't tell me that Democrats won't keep us safe. The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans - Democrats and Republicans - have built, and we are here to restore that legacy.</p> <p>As commander-in-chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home.</p> <p>I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al-Qaida and the Taliban in Afghanistan. I will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts. But I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression. I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease. And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future.</p> <h2><a name=\"economy\">On the economy</a></h2> <p>We Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country.</p> <p>We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma. We measure progress in the 23m new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was president - when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush.</p> <p>We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honours the dignity of work.</p> <p>The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight.</p> <h2><a name=\"taxes\">On taxes</a></h2> <p>Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it.</p> <p>Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America.</p> <p>I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow.</p> <p>I will cut taxes - cut taxes - for 95% of all working families. Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class.</p> <h2>On fuel</h2> <p>For the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as president: in 10 years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East.</p> <p>Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years, and John McCain has been there for 26 of them. In that time, he's said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars, no to investments in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels. And today, we import triple the amount of oil as the day that Senator McCain took office.</p> <p>Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution. Not even close.</p> <p>As president, I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power. I'll help our auto companies retool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America. I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars. And I'll invest $150bn over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and 5m new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced.</p> <h2><a name=\"education\">On education</a></h2> <p>Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy. Michelle and I are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education. And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance. I'll invest in early childhood education. I'll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries and give them more support. And in exchange, I'll ask for higher standards and more accountability. And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education.</p> <h2><a name=\"healthcare\">On healthcare</a></h2> <p>Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible healthcare for every single American. If you have healthcare, my plan will lower your premiums. If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves. And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most.</p> <p>Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent.</p> <h2><a name=\"pensions\">On pensions</a></h2> <p>Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to protect social security for future generations.</p> <h2><a name=\"abortion\">On abortion</a></h2> <p>We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country.</p> <h2>On gun control</h2> <p>The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the second amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals.</p> <h2>On same-sex marriages</h2> <p>I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination.</p> <h2>On immigration</h2> <p>Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers. This too is part of America's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort.</p> <h2>On individual responsibility</h2> <p>We must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than just money. It will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what John F Kennedy called our \"intellectual and moral strength\". Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient. Yes, we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair. But we must also admit that programmes alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need.</p> <p>Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility - that's the essence of America's promise.</p> <h2>On equal pay</h2> <p>And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons.</p> <h2><a name=\"patriotism\">On patriotism</a></h2> <p>What I will not do is suggest that the senator [McCain] takes his positions for political purposes. Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism.</p> <p>The times are too serious, the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook. So let us agree that patriotism has no party. I love this country, and so do you, and so does John McCain. The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag. They have not served a Red America or a Blue America - they have served the United States of America.</p> <p>So I've got news for you, John McCain. We all put our country first.</p> <h2><a name=\"background\">On his background</a></h2> <p>In the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbour, marched in Patton's army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill.</p> <p>In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mum, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships.</p> <p>When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the south side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed.</p> <p>And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman. She's the one who taught me about hard work. She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life. She poured everything she had into me. And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well.</p> <p>I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine. These are my heroes. Theirs are the stories that shaped me. And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the United States.</p> <h2>On change</h2> <p>I realise that I am not the likeliest candidate for this office. I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I haven't spent my career in the halls of Washington.</p> <p>But I stand before you tonight because all across America something is stirring. What the naysayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me. It's been about you.</p> <p>For 18 long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past. You understand that in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result. You have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington. Change comes to Washington. Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time.</p> <p>America, this is one of those moments.</p> <h2>On the American spirit</h2> <p>This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich. We have the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what makes us strong. Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores.</p> <p>Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend.</p>",
  "<p>Tonight was the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.democrats20082\">Big Speech</a>, the night we've all been waiting for, the night to which the talking heads have been feverishly alluding all week, with ominous predictions and loaded rhetoricals about whether Barack Obama can live up to the hype, and whether he will leave the stage a nominee from a fractured or a unified party. And, of course, whether one or both of the Clintons will rush the stage and declare Hillary Clinton Queen of the Universe.</p> <p>It could happen.</p> <p>I know \u2013 because the talking heads in America's Cable News Land have been telling me so <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/27/uselections2008.television\">all</a> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/28/uselections2008.television\">week</a>.</p> <p>Hours before the main event, I flip to MSNBC just in time to see a brazen bystander <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6ooA1ZqzWE\">touch the holy grail of Chris Matthews's mad hair</a>. Jealousy consumes me. It is the first time I've wished I were in Denver.</p> <p>Inside Mile-High Stadium, we are treated to some music. Will.I.Am gives us a nice live rendition of <a href=\"http://www.dipdive.com/dip-politics/ywc/\">Yes We Can</a>, which is followed by some canned music as Sheryl Crow sets up shop. On comes Bowie's cover of The Beatles' Across the Universe. \"Nothing's gonna change my world\u2026.\" Does not compute. It's not only a poor choice for the Change candidate, but it also fucks with one of my most closely-held truths, which is that everything always needs more Bowie, any Bowie.</p> <p>There's nothing going on. It's all about the wait \u2013 just filling time until the Big Speech.</p> <p>Savannah in the Cheap Seats, aka Savannah Guthrie, interviews a guy in the nosebleed section who says he likes Obama because \"I'm for people and Obama's for people.\" I would like to say something snide about how long we've all waited for a president who has the guts to be \"for people,\" but then I remember the last eight years and consider that tomorrow is the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina\u2026 After ten minutes or so spent weeping in the foetal position, I unfold myself and refocus, discovering Virginia Governor Tim Kaine complaining about John McCain's seven houses. Hey, at least he <a href=\"http://www.publicintegrity.org/blog/entry/689/\">doesn't have 55</a>.</p> <p>More filler. Am I really watching <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Buchanan\">Pat Buchanan</a> wearing shades and desk-dancing to Stevie Wonder? What planet am I on?</p> <p>Over at Fox News, they're STILL talking about McCain. Sean Hannity <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2aqyKYSKSo\">complains grumpily</a> that during the Big Speech, we're not going to hear that Obama will cavort with dictators and we're not going to hear that Obama will raise taxes and we're not going to hear how the surge has been a success and we're not going to hear how the economy is awesome. Pout. I hope someone is standing by to resuscitate Hannity when Obama fails to talk about how he's going to enslave White America.</p> <p>Ugh, Dick Morris \u2013 snivelling cretin. Morris, Hannity, and Alan Colmes banter briefly about Obama's speech. Who needs to actually watch the speech when you've got Fox News to tell you what to think about it before it even happens? Morris is certain it will stink based on provided excerpts. (Rarely do you find such an outstanding specimen of man, who is both <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Morris#Fallout\">toe-sucker</a> and oracle.) Coming up on Fox's coverage of the Democratic convention: More speculation about McCain's veep selection.</p> <p>Meanwhile, back on MSNBC, Keith Olbermann and company are analysing the long camera shots showing the (truly impressively) crowded stadium. Olbermann frets that it will make Obama look \"smaller than life rather than bigger than life.\" Gee, well, let's hope he gets a close-up or two!</p> <p>How much are these people paid?</p> <p>Joe Biden takes the stage. I think there may be more people in the stadium than in the entire state of Delaware. He's loving it. He ends his speech, Rat Pack-like, with \"Love ya!\" which I have to say I much prefer to \"God Bless You.\" \"Love ya!\" has some real bada-bing.</p> <p>Filler, filler. Now the gang at MSNBC are pouring over the speech excerpts, and, while they're doing a better job than the loathsome Morris, it's still painful. If Nora O'Donnell refers to the \"optics of this event\" one more time, I'll go on a killing spree. It's nonetheless an improvement on what's going down at Fox, where they're rehashing \"the Jeremiah Wright scandal\" and Brit Hume begrudgingly admits that Mile-High Stadium is \"pretty full.\" It's full metal crazy over there.</p> <p>Finally, at long last, the senior senator from Illinois, Dick Durbin, comes out to introduce Obama, and we are moments away from the Big Speech. Jitter. Durbin's followed by a bio piece about Obama and his family, which is very nice.</p> <p>And then Obama comes out.</p> <p>Cameras flash like frenzied lightning bugs and the crowd roars. The staging is amazing. It is truly worthy of the historic moment to which we're all bearing witness \u2013 this is an African-American man who has is accepting the nomination for the presidency by the Democratic party. Wow. I am without cynicism or snark. I am awed.</p> <p>I listen to the speech.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>It's over. Chris Matthews, being uncharacteristically generous, says it was the hard-fought primary against Hillary Clinton that gave Obama \"the steel\" to be able to make this brilliant speech and live up to the enormous expectations and the overwhelming venue; he is palpably jizzing in his pants over the entire spectacle. I leave him to his private moment and check in with Fox. Brit Hume continues to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvcNTCpY5KI\">begrudge Obama his success</a>, and nearly refers to the candidate as \"Barack Obama,\" but quickly corrects himself to use Fox News in-house style: \"Barack Hussein Obama.\"</p> <p>Over at CNN, Anderson Cooper compulsively refers to everyone who liked the speech as having \"drunk the Kool-Aid.\" GOP consultant Alex Castellanos looks vaguely nauseated. If I had to go up against Obama with McCain, I'd be looking ill myself. Cooper and Wolf Blitzer discuss the speech with Campbell Brown, Paul Begala, and some other nitwits. The segment should be called How to Talk About Race Without Talking About Race. They agree Obama was not too uppity, which is euphemised as eschewing rhetoric that was \"too soaring,\" and compliment his ability to \"throw a punch\" at McCain while not looking like the wild-eyed Angry Black Man, which is euphemised as being \"formidable.\"</p> <p>Blitzer then promises to talk to Clinton supporters after the break and see if Obama managed to win them over. Insert ominous score here. When we come back, Jessica Yellin is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu9nvEduJ1s\">standing with</a> an adorable elderly woman dressed head to toe in pink. She tells Yellin she's now an Obama supporter. What won her over? He did.</p> <p>\"The end is what got me. You know, it's a dream and it's going to come true. We gotta work for it.\"</p> <p>And thus does the media-created story arc of the Democratic Convention come to a tidy end. The dragon of disunity has been slain, and Obama rides off into the sunset on his unity pony.</p> <p>Who, I've been told, is fixing to graze on the lush lawns at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.</p>",

  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337065388\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1760479111_gdn-int-080829-cb-US-Obama-Speech-4x3.flv\"/> </video>   <p>Denver is a very nice city, but it doesn't remotely have the transportation infrastructure to handle this week's onslaught. So, as my wife and I left Invesco Field after Barack Obama's speech, the only choice was the usual one \u2013 to walk \u2013 and the only place to go was across a bridge that thousands and thousands of people were funneling into from many directions and despite the presence of various fences and barricades and jersey walls.</p> <p>It was a nightmare, and under other circumstances (particularly ones where they served beer, which they did not Thursday night), distemper and impatience and testy rhetoric and maybe even a fight or two would've ensued. But this night all was calm. People were patient and cooperative. An African American woman walking in front of us carrying two small American flags turned to us to remark on this. </p> <p>I use this as metaphor for the speech because I thought, while it was not one of those rhetorical barnburners for which the candidate is famous, it accomplished something else, more subtle but maybe more profound. Obama made his speech not about him but about his audience. He gave away some of his power this night and gave it to the people (sure enough, \"Power to the People,\" John Lennon's somewhat unfortunate radical-chic anthem from 1971, was among the background music piped into the stadium before Obama spoke).</p> <p>This to me was the single most important thing about the speech. There were other important aspects to it, and I'll get to those, but the main victory Thursday night was that he successfully made the night not about him in a way that could feed into the Celebrity/Messiah/The One/He Who Makes the Clouds Part narrative that the McCain camp has so successfully deployed.</p> <p>The concerns that the speech-event would feed that narrative were palpable. You know \u2013 this was all about his endless ego and so on. There's no denying the man has an ego, but the worst fears of Obama partisans were not confirmed. He said explicitly at one point, \"What the naysayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me. It's been about you.\" The non-verbal presentation worked as well. The stage set as initially described, a Roman temple of some sort, seemed horrifying and an awful choice sure to feed GOP themes. But in reality it turned out to be fine. It more resembled the Rose Garden portico of the White House than any place where Caligula hosted bacchanals. And anyway it didn't appear that any columns showed on television at all. </p> <p>I haven't watched any TV coverage as I write these words but it's my strong bet that they're not talking any Messiah nonsense. And if the speakers at next week's GOP convention will try to poke fun at the speech on those grounds, they'll get laughs in the hall, but I will bet that the jokes won't resonate outside the pews of the already-believing. The speech was more workmanlike than that. And workmanlike was just what was called for under the circumstances. </p> <p>He talked a lot about the economy. He did not \u2013 the speech's one failing, to my ear \u2013 have a short and strong bumper-sticker phrase describing the guiding philosophy of his economic plan. But after this speech, anyone who highly and mightily demands that Obama produce specifics will merely be showing his ignorance and laziness. He also focused on his empathy for working people's concerns. </p> <p>And speaking directly before him were six or seven regular Americans who'd been hit hard by the Bush economy. Each was fantastic, especially Barney Smith, an Indiana factory worker and lifelong Republican who is disgusted with his party and voting for Obama. </p> <p>It was Smith, not the silver-tongued one, who (surely by design \u2013 another way the night was not about Obama) got off the single most memorable line of the evening: \"We need a president who puts Barney Smith before Smith Barney.\"</p> <p>He took on John McCain in a tough and tonally just right way. He accurately painted McCain as a joke of an intellect on economic questions, and (again, subtly, but clearly) on foreign policy, he described a sort of crazy person whose experience has not given him superior judgment at all. Among the three of them, Obama, Bill Clinton and Joe Biden made a sharp case against a McCain presidency.</p> <p>Obama also addressed questions about his resume and experience, albeit indirectly. But he dealt with the questions about his preparedness and seriousness less with words than with demeanor. He did not look like a guy Thursday night whom Putin could push around and did not sound like a guy who couldn't run the army (about 15 generals also took the stage to endorse him).</p> <p>It was just the right speech for the occasion. He did not aggrandize himself. He explained the seriousness of the task at hand in a way that did not send his shock troops over the moon in Messiah ecstasy. Rather, he equipped them with battle armor \u2013 and with determined serenity about what they had to do until November 4.</p> <p>And that was why everyone behaved in such an orderly way as they exited through a veritable obstacle course. They're armed. They were given agency Thursday night, not made into abject Barack-o-maniacs. And that, for a campaign that's banking on winning this election on the strength of thousands of volunteers, may have been the most important thing, more important even than how the media received it.</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.cityofclovis.org/\">Clovis</a> is a stone's throw over New Mexico's border from Texas. It has just over 40,000 people, which makes it the great metropolis of this corner of the state. If you're heading west, you have to drive 200 miles to Albuquerque to come to the next city of that size in New Mexico. This is high-plains country, geographically more similar to the Texas panhandle just to its east than to the epic desert landscape to the west. Like the places I've <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/28/uselections2008.useconomy\">written about</a>, it's a poor part of America, with an increasing number of struggling, hardscrabble farm in the outlying areas.</p> <p>New Mexico is one of several newly politically competitive states in the mountain and desert west. CNN reported that <a href=\"http://www.santafenewmexican.com/Local%20News/Poll--Obama-up-by-13-points-in-N-M-\">Obama is leading McCain in the state by 13%</a>. Like neighbouring Colorado, and McCain's home state of Arizona, it's a state that had Republican state leadership when Bush won the presidency in 2000 and that has seen its governors and other top positions go Democratic in the years since. Voters out here haven't voted Democratic because of any sudden enthusiasm for higher taxes and the other bug-bears rightly or wrongly associated with national Democrats. At least in part, the region has gone Democrat because, unlike the Oklahoma Panhandle communities I drove through earlier this week, its live-and-let-live population has come to loathe the authoritarian strain of thinking the Bush-Cheney team represents and deeply distrusts the direction government has taken since 2000.</p> <p>A few years back, one-time Colorado Senator and presidential hopeful Gary Hart <a href=\"http://www.westerndemocrat.com/files/GaryHart-DemocratsandtheWest.pdf\">penned a memo</a> to the Democratic Party's leaders arguing the West was ripe for picking and calling on his party to adopt a Western strategy. Choosing Denver to host the convention was a part of this strategy, as was inviting New Mexico governor Bill Richardson onto the stadium platform a couple hours before Obama's speech tonight. (He gave a powerful, emotionally charged speech, far better than that delivered by Al Gore immediately after.) If the Democrats win the west on the tails of popular governors like Richardson and Arizona's Janet Napolitano, they can afford to lose a couple of battleground states in the Midwest and still come out victorious. </p> <p>I figured I would drive into Clovis and find a bar or restaurant at which to watch the Obama speech and talk to people about their reactions. It wouldn't be hard \u2013 surely every television set in America would be tuned in to watch. </p> <p>But, as they say about the best laid plan. In a town with numerous restaurants and bars, not a single one was showing the speech. Some had no televisions; others did have TVs, but they were tuned to one or another sports channel and the owners and bar-tenders were damned if they were going to change channel for the convention. One waitress embarrassedly told me the owners had forbidden the staff to put on anything \"political\" on the television. I even phoned several restaurants to find out if they'd tune their TVs to the convention. To a person, the answer was an incredulous \"no.\"</p> <p>So, I watched the speech in my hotel room. In a way, the experience was instructive. If you've been watching cable news recently, you could be excused for thinking the entire world was about to stop to watch Obama, and you could be forgiven for concluding that nothing but politics was dripping from ordinary-Joes' lips from New York City to Los Angeles and everywhere in between. But, here in Clovis, if people were watching they were doing so in the privacy of their homes; and if they were out at the bars, as many were as the long Labor Day weekend got underway, they weren't imbibing politics. </p> <p>Potentially, that could be a problem for the Democrats, who had staked a huge amount of political capital on wowing America with an amphitheatre-like spectacle to conclude their four day show. It's not enough to get crowds watching in Times Square, or in house parties in LA. For Colorado to produce the needed polling bump, they have to reach the heartlands.</p> <p>On the other hand, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.democrats20082\">sheer majesty of Obama's speech</a>, the confidence he exuded, the promises he made, will, I believe, ricochet through the next two months. People in Clovis might not have watched the speech tonight, but you can be sure they'll be seeing extracts on the news and in political commercials from here until November. They'll see Obama going after McCain on economics and even on national security and military strategy, the Republican's terra firma. They'll see Obama pledging a new economic deal for working Americans. And they'll see footage of Michelle Obama and their two adorable children watching ecstatically as Barack spoke. That's all money in the bank for the Democrats.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.barackobama2\">Obama's speech</a> was extraordinary, both in the ambition of its promises \u2013 a commitment to universal healthcare, to a renewed compact on quality education, a $150b investment in renewable energy technologies, a new foreign policy, a fairer tax system \u2013 and in the stunning delivery. It takes chutzpah and cajones, to address a crowd of 80,000 people. It could all too easily have gone horribly wrong \u2013 indeed, when he came onto the deep blue stage, initially Obama seemed slightly lost, saying \"thank you, thank you so much\" again and again and again in an ineffective effort to tamp down the crowd. But once he got into the meat of his speech, the candidate nailed it.</p> <p>There were echoes of Franklin Roosevelt, John Kennedy, Martin Luther King. This was speech-making at its very finest. </p> <p>Clovis might not have tuned in tonight, but its residents will be hearing about this speech for the next two months. And as the undecideds and the I-don't-cares start to line up with candidates, Obama's speech will filter into the heart of the country. This election will likely be a close-run thing, but eventually this remarkable feat of oratory might just tip the balance.</p>",
  "<p>Standing in front of a set designed to replicate the Lincoln Memorial, before which Martin Luther King stood 45 years ago to deliver his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/28/uselections2008.constitutionandcivilliberties\">\"I have a dream\"</a> speech, Barack Obama forcefully, directly and passionately <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.democrats20082\">set forth his practical vision</a> for a new America. </p> <p>Although Obama's reference to Dr King \u2013 \"the preacher from Georgia\" - was somewhat brief, the historical nature of this event was not lost. In 1963, 45 years ago, when Dr King envisioned an America that he never lived to see, America was a segregated nation. Many African Americans lived in desperate conditions with few rights: unable to vote, forced to attend inferior schools and live separately and highly unequally from white Americans. Someone like Barack Obama was merely a vision, an idea that existed in Dr King's head. </p> <p>There is no doubt that Dr King would have been proud as Barack Obama stood on the stage at Denver's Invesco Stadium, and so eloquently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.barackobama2\">set out his case</a> for why he \u2013 the first African American presidential nominee to lead a major political party in America - would be the best choice as the next American president. As <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/2008-democratic-national-convention-remarks/story.aspx?guid=%7B85F4EDD3-9579-4F62-B553-4E109CACDA6B%7D&amp;dist=hppr\">Martin Luther King III told the convention</a> earlier on Thursday, his father would be \"proud of Barack Obama, proud of the party that nominated him and proud of the America that will elect him\" before saying that Dr King \"is in the hopes and dreams, the competence and courage, the rightness and readiness of Barack Obama.\"</p> <p>In 1963, African Americans were struggling at the hands of a society that enforced injustice and discrimination on the basis that they were not fit to partake on an equal basis in American life. Yesterday, however, Obama stood tall as not just an African-American man but as an all-American man; a man who was able to receive his education at Harvard and Columbia rather than a historically black college, an inferior institution or no college at all. He emphasized that he is a man who shares the same values and love for his country as any other American and while he did so, tens of thousands of non-African Americans listened, agreed and supported him. </p> <p>While things are far from perfect in America when it comes to issues of race, Barack Obama attempted to show us that he can bring to life the ideals that Dr King believed in, not only as a civil rights leader for black people but as a leader of American people as a whole. </p> <p>In Denver yesterday, Obama took his opponent John McCain straight on and directly hit back at every attack that has been made on him. Sarcastically making comments such as \"John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives.\", Obama used his well-crafted and executed speech to address the issues of his celebrity status, patriotism, his apparent lack of experience and his background. </p> <p>He challenged those who have criticised him for his lofty rhetoric by bringing things back to earth, winding his ideology of change and hope around an everyday, practical explanation of exactly what that means. \"Let me spell out exactly what that change would mean as president,\" he said before going on to provide solid figures, setting out his policies on economics, healthcare, energy, Iraq and education - and telling us how exactly they would work and be implemented. He certainly looked and sounded every inch the president. </p> <p>What's important now is whether or not his speech will have an impact on those who were unsure about him. Even though Obama attempted to provide a middle way in his speech, it's likely that his positions on gun crime, abortion and gay marriage may still alienate some voters while others may still believe that while he gave a great speech, his policies still do not resonate with them. </p> <p>As Obama delivered his speech, I reflected on the fact that no matter what happens on November 4, history has already been made on a number of levels. Record numbers of African Americans and young voters have been drawn back into political life. African Americans made up a record <a href=\"http://www.demconvention.com/assets/downloads/Delegate-Diversity-1984-2008.pdf\">24% of the Democratic convention delegates</a> this year while the youngest delegate was just 17. Around $400m has been donated by ordinary American citizens who have been galvanized by the internet and other forms of new media.</p> <p>Ten years ago, when Jesse Jackson had his name placed in the Democratic nomination roll call, his chances of getting to where Obama is today were slim. But in only four years \u2013 since that now famous 2004 convention speech - Barack Obama has risen from a virtual unknown to presidential nominee. It's quite possible that next year we'll see a black family in the White House, a place that was built by African American slaves.</p> <p>Few African-Americans believed that they would see this day in their lifetime. Yet, thanks to Dr King's vision and Obama's attempt to realise that vision, African Americans can now believe that they might one day be able to run for president. In less than five decades they have gone from having their voting rights abused to feeling <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/images/PollingUnit/1068a4BlacksandObama.pdf\">they have a chance</a> to sit in the highest seat of office in the country, while many white Americans now feel ready to support a black presidential candidate. Obama still has work to do if he is to widen the gap between himself and McCain. But if his speech in Denver wasn't a sign of great progress, what is?</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama lives by the idea that this is a defining moment of history. But tonight, for the tens of thousands who watched him accept the Democratic nomination from the vast bowl of an outdoor stadium and for the many more watching on television, there were many such moments.</p> <p>The night was part television spectacle, part political Woodstock, part patriotic outpouring, and part a mass redemption of the promise of Martin Luther King.</p> <p>It was the first time, at least in recent memory, that tens of thousands of people had lined up for hours in the baking sun to listen to a speech at a political convention.</p> <p>It was the first time that the nominee of a major political party made his acceptance address to a crowd dominated by people in their teens and early 20s wearing shorts and summer dresses, padding around the hall in flip flops.</p> <p>It was the first time that a political campaign had combined showmanship with grassroots organising to such effect.</p> <p>And it was the first time that an African-American had come within reach of the White House. Many in the crowd were African-American. \"I just couldn't miss this,\" said one older woman trudging along the line.</p> <p>The finale of the Democratic convention was all of that and more, from the early afternoon when people began funnelling into the stadium to listen to bluegrass bands and Sheryl Crow to the moment when Obama walking out on a long podium to deliver his speech in front of a backdrop of Roman columns that would not have been out of place in Las Vegas.</p> <p>Helicopters circled overhead. Sharpshooters stood on the outer bowl of the stadium outlined in silhouette against the darkening sky. There were metal detectors and security sweeps.</p> <p>But inside there was an atmosphere of carnival. People arrived decked out in full Obama regalia: t-shirts, campaign buttons, and caps. Some also wore shirts emblazoned with the image of Martin Luther King. A few women came in Native American costume. One man snaked through the line dressed as the devil, his legs smeared in red paint.</p> <p>People waved small American flags, stomped their feet, booed George Bush, chanted Si se puede, Yes we can, and collectively turned the stadium into a canvas of constantly flashing light from their camera phones.</p> <p>Stevie Wonder bobbed on the stage, singing Michelle Obama's favourite songs. Al Gore talked about the importance of going out to vote.</p> <p>\"I know something about close elections, so let me offer you my opinion,\" he said. \"I believe this election is close today mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change Barack Obama represents.\"</p> <p>There were quieter moments too, the night interspersed with a roll-out of the generals and admirals who backed Obama and testimonials from one-time Republicans.</p> <p>And there was a clear cold purpose behind the spectacle: each of the 76,000 people who funnelled into the stadium tonight was a potential new recruit to Campaign Obama.</p> <p>Although the Obama camp billed the night as a people's convention, tickets for tonight were an extremely limited commodity, doled out first to those who were already volunteering for the campaign.</p> <p>\"When I found out we were going, I started jumping up and down I was so excited,\" said Connor Stanley, 17, and a student. \"This is a huge historical moment world wide no matter how you look at it.\" </p> <p>At every entrance to the stadium, campaign workers had set up tables to recruit volunteers for phone banks or for canvassing. If that looked too demanding, there was an easier way to sign on: all they had to do was telephone their friends to watch Obama's speech. If they didn't have mobile phones - no problem - the campaign had banks of phones at the ready.</p> <p>At other booths, volunteers registered new voters, and tried to sign up people for postal ballots, ordinarily the most reliable way of ensuring people cast their vote.</p> <p>People were also invited to sign on to the campaign by text message. Within an hour, the campaign said they had received more than 30,000 texts. That's 30,000 potential votes, 30,000 potential volunteers for a grassroots organising campaign that remains unparalleled in recent memory.</p> <p>And, this not being a campaign to leave anything to chance when it comes to networking, organisers flashed the URL for the Obama campaign website on the stadium's giant screens.</p> <p>But once Obama appeared on the stage, the razzmatazz faded away. Some people just could not stop smiling. Others were close to tears.</p> <p>\"This is history. It ain't just fake,\" said Ronnie Houston, 55, who wanted his grandson to be part of the night.</p> <p>As a young man growing up in Florida, Houston had lived through the days when there were separate water fountains for whites and blacks, and when African-Americans had to go to the back of the restaurant to get food.</p> <p>So when the primary campaign got underway last winter, Houston now retired from his job with the Teamsters began volunteering. He spent part of the night with tears in his eyes. </p> <p>\"I think what Dr King said 45 years ago has come to fruition,\" he said. Before Obama, he had never thought he would see a black man in the White House in his lifetime. Now, he said: \"It's going to happen.\"</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337065388\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1760479111_gdn-int-080829-cb-US-Obama-Speech-4x3.flv\"/> </video>   <p>Barack Obama last night fulfilled the promise of his emergence onto the US political stage four years ago and the dream of Martin Luther King almost half a century ago when he accepted the Democratic presidential nomination before tens of thousands of his supporters.</p> <p>Obama's address, at Denver's Mile High stadium, put policy flesh on the rhetoric that had helped propel a virtual unknown at the 2004 Democratic convention to within reach of the White House.</p> <p>Speaking on the 45th anniversary of King's \"I have a dream speech\", the first African-American to secure the nomination of a major party cast himself as heir to Franklin Roosevelt and John Kennedy.</p> <p>He brought the 80,000-plus who packed the stadium to their feet when, concluding a 47-minute speech, he paid homage to King. Adopting the cadences of a southern preacher, Obama said it was the promise of America that had brought people from every corner of the country to hear King on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.</p> <p>Bush had betrayed that promise during the last eight years and the country could not take the chance of another four under John McCain, Obama said.</p> <p>Quoting from King's call to march forward together and not turn back, he echoed the father of the civil rights movement: \"America, we cannot turn back. Not with so much work to be done \u2026 We cannot walk alone. At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future.\"</p> <p>After months of criticism that there was no substance behind the dazzling oratory, Obama allied his soaring rhetoric to long passages on how he would deal with America's ailing economy, the biggest election issue. He offered a programme of education, health and energy reforms, allied to job creation and tax cuts.</p> <p>He finally went after McCain with newfound aggression, to the relief of Democrats despairing at their candidate's unwillingness to go toe-to-toe with his Republican rival. He tied him to Bush, accused him of being out of touch with working- and middle-class Americans, and blamed him for adopting scare tactics and negative campaigning. </p> <p>Showing that in spite of his lofty rhetoric, he can get down and dirty he made sly digs over McCain's volatile temperament and age: McCain turns 72 today.</p> <p>To cheers from the crowd, he challenged McCain's foreign policy judgment and rounded on him for supporting the Iraq war at the expense of failing to go after Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan and Pakistan. \"John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives.\"</p> <p>The Obama campaign had intended last night's address to be a people's event, a radical change from the insider nature of most conventions that aides said symbolised the grassroots nature of his candidacy. He was only the third Democratic candidate to accept the party's presidential nomination outside a convention hall: Roosevelt did in Chicago in 1932, and Kennedy in Los Angeles in 1960.</p> <p>Tens of thousands took the chance to be part of last night's event, with long lines snaking for miles around the stadium under a blazing sun and filling the stadium three hours before he spoke.</p> <p>They came in Martin Luther King t-shirts and in full Obama regalia - t-shirts, hats, and buttons. A few came in Native American traditional dress. One man was dressed as the devil, with smears of red paint on his face and legs.</p> <p>Vendors sold Obama dolls and life-sized figures of Obama dressed as Uncle Sam.</p> <p>Inside the stadium, there was a collective sense of history in the making. Flash bulbs popped incessantly from the stands, as people waved small American flags, bopped to Motown and shouted \"Yes, we can\" as Will.i.am and other performers took to the stage.</p> <p>Obama came to his first Democratic convention eight years ago short of cash and frequently frisked by security because of his name. Last night he recalled his arrival on the national scene at the next one in when his speech caught the imagination of a despondent Democratic party.</p> <p>\"Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to,\" he said.</p> <p>\"It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well.\"</p> <p>He used his own life story, too, to address the negative campaign that McCain has mounted over the last two months, in particular that he was too fond of his new-found celebrity status.</p> <p>He spoke about the sacrifices made by his family. \"I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine,\" he said.</p> <p>He also responded to charges by Republicans questioning his patriotism. He adapted a line from that 2004 convention speech in Boston to argue that the men and women fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan may have been of different parties but all died under the same flag.</p> <p>\"They have not served a red America or a blue America - they have served the United States of America,\" he said. \"So I've got news for you, John McCain: We all put our country first.\" </p> <p>He took McCain to task for his negative campaign ads. \"What I will not do is suggest that the senator takes his positions for political purposes,\" Obama said. \"Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism.\"</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama had his moments of lofty rhetoric at the Democratic convention tonight, but it was the specifics and substance that particularly pleased the Mile High stadium audience.</p> <p>Guests leaving the convention after Obama's speech overwhelmingly praised his focus on details, appearing almost relieved to see him mingle policy proposals with the \"change\" message he is known for.</p> <p>\"The Democratic platform on the first day [of the convention] was somewhat vague,\" Denver native Richard Montoya said. \"Now it's suddenly got a lot of energy.\"</p> <p>Shirley Mosley, who earned her ticket to the acceptance speech by volunteering for Obama, agreed: \"He was more specific, and I liked that.\"</p> <p>Deborah Cape, a nurse from nearby Fort Collins, Colorado, was hard-pressed to pick one issue that stood out for her because \"he covered everything I could think of\" in the speech. </p> <p>Many Obama fans heard a counter-punch at John McCain in the Democrat's riffs on middle-class tax cuts and offshore oil drilling.</p> <p>\"That's been the big criticism from Republicans, that he's all show and no substance,\" John Robinson, who drove to Denver from Virginia to hear the speech, said. \"If [voters] don't know who he is after this, they never will.\"</p> <p>Obama's anti-Bush quip that \"eight [years] is enough\" was the most frequently quoted line in the queue to leave the stadium. But his rebuttal of Republican attacks on his fame and patriotism was an even bigger hit with the audience.</p> <p>\"You can expect tomorrow that [Republicans] are going to criticise everything the Democratic party said tonight,\" Montoya said. \"We've got to get into the habit of defending ourselves.\"</p> <p>But how does that aggressive approach square with Obama's promise to not accuse McCain of taking positions for \"political purposes\"? Montoya's wife Gail said the Democratic nominee walked the line honourably.</p> <p>\"Barack doesn't necessarily have to attack\" McCain, she said, \"but he has to defend against the untruths.\" </p> <p>Denver native Steve Langion said Obama managed to stay \"respectful\" of McCain during the speech, drawing a contrast with McCain's series of negative adverts.</p> <p>\"I hope the country's above that, above negative ads, and that they will vote not out of fear,\" Langion said.</p> <p>Cape, the nurse, said a policy-based attack on McCain would help win over undecided voters. \"It's so positive - rather than the politics of fear, it's the politics of optimism \u2026 even Republicans are tired of the fear, of the warmongering,\" she said.</p> <p>Amid the euphoric response to Obama's platform there was also still a healthy dose of rock-star excitement. </p> <p>Becky Godec of Denver, decked out in Democratic memorabilia, was glowing as she said the \"inspiring\" speech left her \"feel[ing] sent to go do the mission now\". </p> <p>Godec's teenaged daughter Abby was bouncing with excitement as she predicted Obama would convert his critics. \"He said that we're here as Americans, not as Democrats \u2026 he played how hard times really are [but said] we can change.\"</p> <p>Asked whether John McCain's anticipated running-mate announcement tomorrow might steal Obama's thunder, Abby Godec smiled knowingly. \"Whatever,\" she said.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337065388\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1760479111_gdn-int-080829-cb-US-Obama-Speech-4x3.flv\"/> </video>   <p>At the front and centre of Barack Obama's nomination acceptance speech was an aspirational promise to working and middle-class voters to renew \"America's promise\".</p> <p>The phrase - the speech even came with the title \"The American promise\" - was woven into the hour-long address at every stage. American promise made its first appearance in a brief reprise of Obama's life story near the beginning, when he referred to his parents' \"belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to\". It reached its apotheosis right at the end as Obama invoked the spirit and example of Martin Luther King, whose 1963 I Have a Dream speech was given in Washington 45 years ago to the day.</p> <p>In between, American promise became the aspirational and communitarian theme that unified substantial sections of the speech on domestic, foreign and security policy, some scathing attacks on John McCain's record of support for the Bush administration. At one stage Obama defined the American promise as \"the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper\".</p> <p>\"That's the promise we need to keep,\" he continued. \"That's the change we need right now.\" </p> <p>At which point, in his stump speeches during the primary campaign, Obama's oratory would have soared off into a series of rhetorical riffs on the theme of change. There was indeed to be such a passage later in the speech, but in this address, before a televised audience at the start of the general election campaign, Obama did something he rarely did on the campaign trail but which he had promised in the run-up to this convention speech. He got specific.</p> <p>\"Let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am president,\" he promised. And he did. Abolition of capital gains taxes for small businesses. Tax cuts for 95% of American families. A pledge to make the United States energy independent of the middle east within 10 years (shades of John Kennedy's equally improbable, but fulfilled, pledge to put a man on the moon in a decade). $150bn to be spent on renewable energy sources within the same decade. A look (but no specific pledge) on a new role for nuclear power. Investment in pre-school education. Accessible healthcare for every American. Equal pay for equal work. </p> <p>All these plans have been published and mentioned by Obama before, but this was the first time he had presented them as a full menu of election pledges to American voters. And, as any campaigner knows, that meant he had to say how he would pay for all these giveaways and government programmes. </p> <p>Here the details were sketchier. The closure of corporate tax loopholes and tax havens and a \"line by line\" reexamination of the federal budget to cut down on obsolete programmes and cut red tape. \"I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy,\" was how he put it.</p> <p>The expected attacks on McCain in the speech contrasted with Obama's campaign trail insistence that he was not interested in negative tactics. \"John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives,\" was a line that raised huge cheers. There were digs at McCain's age in the line that \"We need a president who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past.\" And there was a provocative warning about McCain's temper in the comment that \"If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next Commander-in-Chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have.\" And he surely will.</p>",
  "<p>One of the greatest gifts of our democracy is the opportunity it offers us every four years to change course. It's not a guarantee; it's only an opportunity. The question facing us is, simply put, will we seize this opportunity for change? That's why I came here tonight: to tell you why I feel so strongly that we must seize this opportunity to elect Barack Obama president of the United States.</p> <p>Eight years ago, some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didn't really matter who became president. Our nation was enjoying peace and prosperity. Some assumed we would continue both, no matter the outcome. But here we all are in 2008, and I doubt anyone would argue now that election didn't matter.</p> <p>Take it from me, if it had ended differently, we would not be bogged down in Iraq, we would have pursued bin Laden until we captured him. We would not be facing a self-inflicted economic crisis; we would be fighting for middle-income families. We would not be showing contempt for the Constitution; we'd be protecting the rights of every American regardless of race, religion, disability, gender or sexual orientation. And we would not be denying the climate crisis; we'd be solving it.</p> <p>Today, we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000, though it may be even more obvious now, because John McCain, a man who has earned our respect on many levels, is now openly endorsing the policies of the Bush-Cheney White House and promising to actually continue them. The same policies all over again?</p> <p>Hey, I believe in recycling, but that's ridiculous. With John McCain's support, President Bush and Vice-President Cheney have led our nation into one calamity after another because of their indifference to fact; their readiness to sacrifice the long term to the short term, subordinate the general good to the benefit of the few and short-circuit the rule of law.</p> <p>If you like the Bush-Cheney approach, John McCain's your man. If you want change, then vote for Barack Obama and Joe Biden.</p> <p>Barack Obama is telling us exactly what he will do: launch a bold new economic plan to restore America's greatness; fight for smarter government that trusts the market, but protects us against its excesses; enact policies that are pro-choice, pro-education and pro-family, establish a foreign policy that is smart as well as strong; provide healthcare for all and solutions for the climate crisis.</p> <p>So why is this election so close? Well, I know something about close elections, so let me offer you my opinion. I believe this election is close today mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change Barack Obama represents.</p> <p>There is no better example than the climate crisis. As I have said for many years throughout this land, we're borrowing money from China to buy oil from the Persian Gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilisation. Every bit of that has to change. Oil company profits have soared to record levels, gasoline prices have gone through the roof and we are more dependent than ever on dirty and dangerous fossil fuels.</p> <p>Many scientists predict that the entire north polar ice cap may be completely gone during summer months in the first term of the next president. Sea levels are rising, fires are raging, storms are stronger. Military experts warn us our national security is threatened by massive waves of climate refugees destabilizing countries around the world, and scientists tell us the very web of life is endangered by unprecedented extinctions.</p> <p>We are facing a planetary emergency which, if not solved, would exceed anything we've ever experienced in the history of humankind. In spite of John McCain's past record of open-mindedness on the climate crisis, he has apparently now allowed his party to browbeat him into abandoning his support of mandatory caps on global warming pollution.</p> <p>And it just so happens that the climate crisis is intertwined with the other two great challenges facing our nation: reviving our economy and strengthening our national security. The solutions to all three require us to end our dependence on carbon-based fuels.</p> <p>Instead of letting lobbyists and polluters control our destiny, we need to invest in American innovation. Almost 100 years ago, Thomas Edison said, \"I'd put my money on the sun and solar energy. What a source of power! I hope we don't have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that.\" We already have everything we need to use the sun, the wind, geothermal power, conservation and efficiency to solve the climate crisis - everything, that is, except a president who inspires us to believe: \"Yes we can.\"</p> <p>So how did this no-brainer become a brain-twister? Because the carbon fuels industry - big oil and coal - have a 50-year lease on the Republican party and they are drilling it for everything it's worth. And this same industry has spent a half a billion dollars this year alone trying to convince the public they are actually solving the problem, when they are in fact making it worse every single day.</p> <p>This administration and the special interests who control it lock, stock and barrel after barrel, have performed this same sleight-of-hand on issue after issue. Some of the best marketers have the worst products; and this is certainly true of today's Republican party. The party itself has on its rolls men and women of great quality. But the last eight years demonstrate that the special interests who have come to control the Republican party are so powerful that serving them and serving the national wellbeing are now irreconcilable choices.</p> <p>So what can we do about it? We can carry Barack Obama's message of hope and change to every family in America. And pledge that we will be there for Barack Obama - not only in the heat of this election, but in the aftermath as we put his agenda to work for our country.</p> <p>We can tell Republicans and Independents, as well as Democrats, why our nation needs a change from the approach of Bush, Cheney and McCain. After they wrecked our economy, it is time for a change. After they abandoned the search for the terrorists who attacked us and redeployed the troops to invade a nation that did not attack us, it's time for a change. After they abandoned the American principle first laid down by general George Washington, when he prohibited the torture of captives because it would bring, in his words, \"shame, disgrace and ruin\" to our nation, it's time for a change.</p> <p>When as many as three supreme court justices could be appointed in the first term of the next president, and John McCain promises to appoint more Scalias and Thomases and end a woman's right to choose, it's time for a change.</p> <p>Many people have been waiting for some sign that our country is ready for such change. How will we know when it's beginning to take hold? I think we might recognise it as a sign of such change, if we saw millions of young people getting involved for the first time in the political process. This election is actually not close at all among younger voters - you are responding in unprecedented numbers to Barack Obama's message of change and hope.</p> <p>You recognise that he represents a clean break from the politics of partisanship and bitter division. You understand that the politics of the past are exhausted, and you're tired of appeals based on fear. You know that America is capable of better than what you have seen in recent years. You are hungry for a new politics based on bipartisan respect for the ageless principles embodied in the United States Constitution.</p> <p>There are times in the history of our nation when our very way of life depends upon awakening to the challenge of a present danger, shaking off complacency to rise, clear-eyed and alert, to the necessity of embracing change.</p> <p>A century and a half ago, when America faced our greatest trial, the end of one era gave way to the birth of another. The candidate who emerged victorious in that election is now regarded by most historians as our greatest president. Before he entered the White House, Abraham Lincoln's experience in elective office consisted of eight years in his state legislature in Springfield, Illinois, and one term in Congress - during which he showed the courage and wisdom to oppose the invasion of another country that was popular when it started but later condemned by history.</p> <p>The experience Lincoln's supporters valued most in that race was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse. He was known chiefly as a clear thinker and a great orator, with a passion for justice and a determination to heal the deep divisions of our land. He insisted on reaching past partisan and regional divides to exalt our common humanity. In 2008, once again, we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning. And once again, we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition.</p> <p>Barack Obama had the experience and wisdom to oppose a popular war based on faulty premises. His leadership experience has given him a unique capacity to inspire hope, in the promise of the American dream of a boundless future. His experience has also given him genuine respect for different views and humility, in the face of complex realities that cannot be squeezed into the narrow compartments of ideology. His experience has taught him something that career politicians often overlook: that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governance.</p> <p>The extraordinary strength of his personal character - and that of his wonderful wife, Michelle - is grounded in the strengths of the American community. His vision and his voice represent the best of America. His life experience embodies the essence of our motto - e pluribus unum - out of many, one. That is the linking identity at the other end of all the hyphens that pervade our modern political culture. It is that common American identity \u2013 which Barack Obama exemplifies, heart and soul - that enables us as Americans to speak with moral authority to all of the peoples of the world, to inspire hope that we as human beings can transcend our limitations and to redeem the promise of human freedom.</p> <p>Late this evening, our convention will end with a benediction. As we bow in reverence, remember the words of the old proverb: \"when you pray, move your feet.\" Then let us leave here tonight and take the message of hope from Denver to every corner of our land, and do everything we can to serve our nation, our world - and most importantly, our children and their future - by electing Barack Obama President of the United States.</p>",

To President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next vice-president of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you. I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time, a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night.</p> <p>To the love of my life, our next first lady, Michelle Obama, and to Sasha and Malia - I love you so much, and I'm so proud of all of you.</p> <p>Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.</p> <p>It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generationcan pursue their dreams as well.</p> <p>That's why I stand here tonight. Because for 232 years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women - students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors - found the courage to keep it alive.</p> <p>We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil and the American promise has been threatened once more.</p> <p>Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less. More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet. More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay and tuition that's beyond your reach.</p> <p>These challenges are not all of government's making. But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W Bush.</p> <p>America, we are better than these last eight years. We are a better country than this.</p> <p>This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work.</p> <p>This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for 20 years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news.</p> <p>We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes.</p> <p>Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land - enough! This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive. Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third. And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight. On November 4th, we must stand up and say: \"Eight is enough.\"</p> <p>Now let there be no doubt. The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect. And next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need.</p> <p>But the record's clear: John McCain has voted with George Bush 90% of the time. Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than 90% of the time? I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a 10% chance on change.</p> <p>The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on healthcare and education and the economy - Senator McCain has been anything but independent. He said that our economy has made \"great progress\" under this president. He said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong. And when one of his chief advisers - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a \"mental recession,\" and that we've become, and I quote, \"a nation of whiners\".</p> <p>A nation of whiners? Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made. Tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty. These are not whiners. They work hard and give back and keep going without complaint. These are the Americans that I know.</p> <p>Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans. I just think he doesn't know. Why else would he define middle class as someone making under $5m a year? How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans? How else could he offer a healthcare plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatise social security and gamble your retirement?</p> <p>It's not because John McCain doesn't care. It's because John McCain doesn't get it.</p> <p>For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy - give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else. In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society, but what it really means is - you're on your own. Out of work? Tough luck. No healthcare? The market will fix it. Born into poverty? Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps - even if you don't have boots. You're on your own.</p> <p>Well it's time for them to own their failure. It's time for us to change America.</p> <p>You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country.</p> <p>We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma. We measure progress in the 23m new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was president - when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush.</p> <p>We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work.</p> <p>The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight.</p> <p>Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill.</p> <p>In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships.</p> <p>When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the south side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed.</p> <p>And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman. She's the one who taught me about hard work. She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life. She poured everything she had into me. And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well.</p> <p>I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine. These are my heroes. Theirs are the stories that shaped me. And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the United States.</p> <p>What is that promise?</p> <p>It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect.</p> <p>It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road.</p> <p>Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology.</p> <p>Our government should work for us, not against us. It should help us, not hurt us. It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work.</p> <p>That's the promise of America - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper.</p> <p>That's the promise we need to keep. That's the change we need right now. So let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am president.</p> <p>Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it.</p> <p>Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America.</p> <p>I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow.</p> <p>I will cut taxes - cut taxes - for 95% of all working families. Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class.</p> <p>And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as president: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East.</p> <p>Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years, and John McCain has been there for 26 of them. In that time, he's said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars, no to investments in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels. And today, we import triple the amount of oil as the day that Senator McCain took office.</p> <p>Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution. Not even close.</p> <p>As president, I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power. I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America. I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars. And I'll invest $150bn dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and 5m new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced.</p> <p>America, now is not the time for small plans.</p> <p>Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy. Michelle and I are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education. And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance. I'll invest in early childhood education. I'll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries and give them more support. And in exchange, I'll ask for higher standards and more accountability. And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education.</p> <p>Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible healthcare for every single American. If you have healthcare, my plan will lower your premiums. If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves. And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most.</p> <p>Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent.</p> <p>Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to protect social security for future generations.</p> <p>And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons.</p> <p>Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow. But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet 21st-century challenges with a 20th-century bureaucracy.</p> <p>And Democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than just money. It will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what John F Kennedy called our \"intellectual and moral strength\". Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient. Yes, we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair. But we must also admit that programmes alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need.</p> <p>Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility - that's the essence of America's promise.</p> <p>And just as we keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep America's promise abroad. If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next commander-in-chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have.</p> <p>For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face. When John McCain said we could just \"muddle through\" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights. John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives.</p> <p>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79bn surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.</p> <p>That's not the judgment we need. That won't keep America safe. We need a president who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past.</p> <p>You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in 80 countries by occupying Iraq. You don't protect Israel and deter Iran just by talking tough in Washington. You can't truly stand up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances. If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need.</p> <p>We are the party of Roosevelt. We are the party of Kennedy. So don't tell me that Democrats won't defend this country. Don't tell me that Democrats won't keep us safe. The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans - Democrats and Republicans - have built, and we are here to restore that legacy.</p> <p>As commander-in-chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home.</p> <p>I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al-Qaida and the Taliban in Afghanistan. I will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts. But I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression. I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease. And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future.</p> <p>These are the policies I will pursue. And in the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John McCain.</p> <p>But what I will not do is suggest that the senator takes his positions for political purposes. Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism.</p> <p>The times are too serious, the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook. So let us agree that patriotism has no party. I love this country, and so do you, and so does John McCain. The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag. They have not served a Red America or a Blue America - they have served the United States of America.</p> <p>So I've got news for you, John McCain. We all put our country first.</p> <p>America, our work will not be easy. The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past. For part of what has been lost these past eight years can't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits. What has also been lost is our sense of common purpose - our sense of higher purpose. And that's what we have to restore.</p> <p>We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country. The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the second amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals. I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination. Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers. This too is part of America's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort.</p> <p>I know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk. They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values. And that's to be expected. Because if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters. If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from.</p> <p>You make a big election about small things.</p> <p>And you know what - it's worked before. Because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government. When Washington doesn't work, all its promises seem empty. If your hopes have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop hoping, and settle for what you already know.</p> <p>I get it. I realise that I am not the likeliest candidate for this office. I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I haven't spent my career in the halls of Washington.</p> <p>But I stand before you tonight because all across America something is stirring. What the nay-sayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me. It's been about you.</p> <p>For 18 long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past. You understand that in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result. You have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington. Change comes to Washington. Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time.</p> <p>America, this is one of those moments.</p> <p>I believe that as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming. Because I've seen it. Because I've lived it. I've seen it in Illinois, when we provided healthcare to more children and moved more families from welfare to work. I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands.</p> <p>And I've seen it in this campaign. In the young people who voted for the first time, and in those who got involved again after a very long time. In the Republicans who never thought they'd pick up a Democratic ballot, but did. I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbours who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise.</p> <p>This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich. We have the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what makes us strong. Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores.</p> <p>Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend.</p> <p>That promise is our greatest inheritance. It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot.</p> <p>And it is that promise that 45 years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in Washington, before Lincoln's memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream.</p> <p>The men and women who gathered there could've heard many things. They could've heard words of anger and discord. They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred.</p> <p>But what the people heard instead - people of every creed and colour, from every walk of life - is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked. That together, our dreams can be one.</p> <p>\"We cannot walk alone,\" the preacher cried. \"And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back.\"</p> <p>America, we cannot turn back. Not with so much work to be done. Not with so many children to educate, and so many veterans to care for. Not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save. Not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend. America, we cannot turn back. We cannot walk alone. At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future. Let us keep that promise - that American promise - and in the words of scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess.</p> <p>Thank you, God bless you and God bless the United States of America.</p>",

I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time, a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night.</p> <p>To the love of my life, our next First Lady, Michelle Obama, and to Sasha and Malia I love you so much, and I'm so proud of all of you.</p> <p>Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.</p> <p>It is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well.</p> <p>That's why I stand here tonight. Because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors -- found the courage to keep it alive.</p> <p>We meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more.</p> <p>Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less. More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet. More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay, and tuition that's beyond your reach.</p> <p>These challenges are not all of government's making. But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W. Bush.</p> <p>America, we are better than these last eight years. We are a better country than this.</p> <p>This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work.</p> <p>This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news.</p> <p>We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes.</p> <p>Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land enough! This moment this election is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive. Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third. And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight. On November 4th, we must stand up and say: \"Eight is enough.\"</p> <p>Now let there be no doubt. The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect. And next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need.</p> <p>But the record's clear: John McCain has voted with George Bush ninety percent of the time. Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time? I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a ten percent chance on change.</p> <p>The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives on health care and education and the economy Senator McCain has been anything but independent. He said that our economy has made \"great progress\" under this President. He said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong. And when one of his chief advisors the man who wrote his economic plan was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a \"mental recession,\" and that we've become, and I quote, \"a nation of whiners.\"</p> <p>A nation of whiners? Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made. Tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty. These are not whiners. They work hard and give back and keep going without complaint. These are the Americans that I know.</p> <p>Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans. I just think he doesn't know. Why else would he define middle-class as someone making under five million dollars a year? How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans? How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement?</p> <p>It's not because John McCain doesn't care. It's because John McCain doesn't get it.</p> <p>For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else. In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society, but what it really means is you're on your own. Out of work? Tough luck. No health care? The market will fix it. Born into poverty? Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps even if you don't have boots. You're on your own.</p> <p>Well it's time for them to own their failure. It's time for us to change America.</p> <p>You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country.</p> <p>We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma. We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush.</p> <p>We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work.</p> <p>The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight.</p> <p>Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill.</p> <p>In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships.</p> <p>When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed.</p> <p>And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman. She's the one who taught me about hard work. She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life. She poured everything she had into me. And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well.</p> <p>I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine. These are my heroes. Theirs are the stories that shaped me. And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States.</p> <p>What is that promise?</p> <p>It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect.</p> <p>It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road.</p> <p>Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology.</p> <p>Our government should work for us, not against us. It should help us, not hurt us. It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work.</p> <p>That's the promise of America the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper.</p> <p>That's the promise we need to keep. That's the change we need right now. So let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am President.</p> <p>.</p> <p>Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it.</p> <p>Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America.</p> <p>I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow.</p> <p>I will cut taxes cut taxes for 95% of all working families. Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class.</p> <p>And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East.</p> <p>Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years, and John McCain has been there for twenty-six of them. In that time, he's said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars, no to investments in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels. And today, we import triple the amount of oil as the day that Senator McCain took office.</p> <p>Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution. Not even close.</p> <p>As President, I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to safely harness nuclear power. I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America. I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars. And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced.</p> <p>America, now is not the time for small plans.</p> <p>Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy. Michelle and I are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education. And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance. I'll invest in early childhood education. I'll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries and give them more support. And in exchange, I'll ask for higher standards and more accountability. And we will keep our promise to every young American if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education.</p> <p>Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single American. If you have health care, my plan will lower your premiums. If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves. And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most.</p> <p>Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent.</p> <p>Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to protect Social Security for future generations.</p> <p>And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons.</p> <p>Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow. But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy.</p> <p>And Democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than just money. It will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what John F. Kennedy called our \"intellectual and moral strength.\" Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient. Yes, we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair. But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need.</p> <p>Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility that's the essence of America's promise.</p> <p>And just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep America's promise abroad. If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next Commander-in-Chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have.</p> <p>For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face. When John McCain said we could just \"muddle through\" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights. John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell but he won't even go to the cave where he lives.</p> <p>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.</p> <p>That's not the judgment we need. That won't keep America safe. We need a President who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past.</p> <p>You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying Iraq. You don't protect Israel and deter Iran just by talking tough in Washington. You can't truly stand up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances. If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice but it is not the change we need.</p> <p>We are the party of Roosevelt. We are the party of Kennedy. So don't tell me that Democrats won't defend this country. Don't tell me that Democrats won't keep us safe. The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans -- Democrats and Republicans have built, and we are here to restore that legacy.</p> <p>As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home.</p> <p>I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan. I will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts. But I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression. I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease. And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future.</p> <p>These are the policies I will pursue. And in the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John McCain.</p> <p>But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes. Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism.</p> <p>The times are too serious, the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook. So let us agree that patriotism has no party. I love this country, and so do you, and so does John McCain. The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag. They have not served a Red America or a Blue America they have served the United States of America.</p> <p>So I've got news for you, John McCain. We all put our country first.</p> <p>America, our work will not be easy. The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past. For part of what has been lost these past eight years can't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits. What has also been lost is our sense of common purpose our sense of higher purpose. And that's what we have to restore.</p> <p>We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country. The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals. I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination. Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers. This too is part of America's promise the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort.</p> <p>I know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk. They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values. And that's to be expected. Because if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters. If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from.</p> <p>You make a big election about small things.</p> <p>And you know what it's worked before. Because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government. When Washington doesn't work, all its promises seem empty. If your hopes have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop hoping, and settle for what you already know.</p> <p>I get it. I realize that I am not the likeliest candidate for this office. I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I haven't spent my career in the halls of Washington.</p> <p>But I stand before you tonight because all across America something is stirring. What the nay-sayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me. It's been about you.</p> <p>For eighteen long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past. You understand that in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result. You have shown what history teaches us that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington. Change comes to Washington. Change happens because the American people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time.</p> <p>America, this is one of those moments.</p> <p>I believe that as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming. Because I've seen it. Because I've lived it. I've seen it in Illinois, when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work. I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands.</p> <p>And I've seen it in this campaign. In the young people who voted for the first time, and in those who got involved again after a very long time. In the Republicans who never thought they'd pick up a Democratic ballot, but did. I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise.</p> <p>This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich. We have the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what makes us strong. Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores.</p> <p>Instead, it is that American spirit that American promise that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend.</p> <p>That promise is our greatest inheritance. It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot.</p> <p>And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream.</p> <p>The men and women who gathered there could've heard many things. They could've heard words of anger and discord. They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred.</p> <p>But what the people heard instead people of every creed and color, from every walk of life is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked. That together, our dreams can be one.</p> <p>\"We cannot walk alone,\" the preacher cried. \"And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back.\"</p> <p>America, we cannot turn back. Not with so much work to be done. Not with so many children to educate, and so many veterans to care for. Not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save. Not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend. America, we cannot turn back. We cannot walk alone. At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future. Let us keep that promise that American promise and in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess.</p> <p>Thank you, God Bless you, and God Bless the United States of America.</p> <p>[<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.barackobama\">Go back</a> to the liveblog]</p>",
  "<p><strong>DENVER</strong> \u2014 There isn't really any other way to say it: to step out into the main arena here at Invesco Field, where Barack Obama will soon accept the Democratic nomination as the first black presidential candidate of a major American political party, is to taste history in the making, in the air. The stadium hasn't yet nearly reached its capacity of 75,000, but already, the emotion hits you in waves when you step into the crowd; almost everyone seems on the brink of tears. (A delegate from Kentucky just stopped me to ask directions to the hamburger stand; within two more sentences \u2014 all I did was ask her how she was finding the occasion so far \u2014 her eyes were glistening.) We've already heard from the daughter and eldest son of Martin Luther King, in two highly moving speeches; Stevie Wonder and Al Gore are due on any minute. You can consider tonight's liveblog officially started, but the key hour begins at <strong>8pm Denver time</strong> (<strong>10pm eastern, 3am UK time</strong> \u2014 coffee, people, coffee!): join me for what can't really help but be an extraordinary night.</p> <p><strong>6.46pm:</strong> Actually, Stevie Wonder's been and gone, to a rapturous reception. Here's Al Gore, with a nice line: \"Today, we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000, though it may be even more obvious now, because John McCain, a man who has earned our respect on many levels, is now openly endorsing the policies of the Bush-Cheney White House and promising to actually continue them. The same policies, all over again? Hey, I believe in recycling, but that's ridiculous.\"</p> <p><strong>6.57pm:</strong> In a risky line, addressing the \"experience\" criticism of Obama, Gore notes that Abraham Lincoln, \"now regarded by most historians as our greatest president,\" had almost exactly the same experience in elective office as Obama: \"Eight years in his state legislature in Springfield, Illinois, and one term in Congress.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337056955\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/8/29/1219971979247/crowd1.jpg\" alt=\"crowds\" width=\"458\" height=\"137\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>7.05pm:</strong> Despite all the elation here, the word that Obama's campaign aides have been using to describe the speech we can expect to hear tonight is 'workmanlike'. In any circumstances, there would be <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/29/us/politics/29stage.html?ref=us&amp;pagewanted=print\">significant political risks</a> involved in staging an event as vast and high-profile as this one. But the Obama campaign planned this historic public nomination acceptance before the McCain campaign started vigorously pushing its \"celebrity\" line in the media, so now it's even more crucial that Obama tries to anchor the occasion with some down-to-earth policy talk. \"I'm not aiming for a lot of high rhetoric,\" he said yesterday. \"I am much more concerned with communicating how I intend to help middle-class families live their lives.\" Given the pitch of emotion here already, keeping this event down-to-earth could be a struggle. But adulatory crowds coupled with workmanlike language from the podium is probably a combination that Team Obama would like just fine.</p> <p><strong>7.11pm:</strong> CNN isn't taking any risks with its headlines: <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/08/28/dnc.day/?iref=mpstoryview\">Obama expected to address change in speech</a>.</p> <p><strong>7.25pm:</strong> An appearance from Joe Biden. Meanwhile, SPOILER ALERT! It would be wrong not to inform you that an advance version of Obama's speech has been released, and is in various places online. I've posted it <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/aug/29/1\">here</a>.</p> <p><strong>7.50pm:</strong> Just back from the floor to my computer. It's crazy out there. We heard from six \"American voices\", including the cannily selected Barney Smith, who got a huge cheer for saying the government should care more about Barney Smith than Smith Barney...</p> <p><strong>8pm:</strong> Illinois senator Dick Durbin is here to introduce Obama. And now a video tribute, in which Obama says he \"probably was shaped more by his [father's] absence than his presence.\"</p> <p><strong>8.05pm:</strong> The updated full advance version of Obama's remarks are <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/aug/29/1\">here</a>. </p> <p><strong>8.08pm:</strong> In that other story, no leak yet to disrupt the media coverage of this event, but lots of people <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/211096.php\">seem to think</a> John McCain is about to pick \u2014 or in fact has picked \u2014 Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty.</p> <p><strong>8.11pm:</strong> It's that Barack Obama guy! The applause, by my count, lasts justs under two minutes. Wild.</p> <p><strong>\"With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.\"</strong></p> <p>(Yesterday, he was the official nominee. Today, he's officially officially the nominee. No, like, he's <em>really</em> the nominee now.)</p> <p><strong>8.18pm:</strong> Thanks for Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, Joe Biden. \"Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story -- of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to. It is that promise that has always set this country apart -- that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well.\"</p> <p><strong>8.20pm:</strong> \"America, we are better than these last eight years. We are a better country than this... Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land -- enough!\" He really shouted \"enough\" -- nothing \"conciliatory\" about that at all. The audience here loved hearing it. </p> <p>\"Next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third. And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight. On November 4th, we must stand up and say: 'Eight is enough.'\" That's a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_Is_Enough\">TV reference</a>.</p> <p><strong>8.27pm:</strong> A reprise of something we've heard a lot in this convention -- a \"more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger\" criticism of John McCain, beginning with the respect that the Obama team know it's wise to pay to his military service and his former maverick ways. \"Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans. I just think he doesn't know. Why else would he define middle-class as someone making under five million dollars a year? How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than 100m Americans?... It's not because John McCain doesn't care. It's because John McCain doesn't get it.\" The focus here is, as many predicted, largely economic, reaching out to the much-focused-on hard-up voters, especially in key swing states.</p> <p>\"Born into poverty? Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps - even if you don't have boots. You're on your own.\" Nice line. A reference to economic prosperity under Bill Clinton gets a big cheer.</p> <p><strong>8.31pm:</strong> A direct hit back on the \"celebrity\" line, after a list of struggling but inspiring Americans, including his own mother: \"I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine. These are my heroes. Theirs are the stories that shaped me. And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States.\"</p> <p><strong>8.34pm:</strong> A raft of economic specifics, and then this: \"And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East.\"</p> <p>\"I'm on the fourth floor with Sarah Silverman,\" my colleague Richard Adams emails from elsewhere in the stadium, annoyingly.</p> <p><strong>8.42pm:</strong> Just back from the stadium floor, where I arrived in time for a passage on tax and education spending. It was loud out there before. Now it is VERY VERY LOUD indeed. There's also a big, big echo, which makes it hard to hear Obama, though seeing him's no problem, thanks to the gigantic screens.</p> <p><strong>8.44pm:</strong> And on to foreign policy: Obama's opposition to the war... \"John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell -- but he won't even go to the cave where he lives.\" McCain is even more stubborn than Bush on Iraq, he's saying now.</p> <p><strong>8.47pm:</strong> I don't really understand this line, which is clearly an attempt to seize the moral high ground: \"But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes.\" He does, though, doesn't he?</p> <p>\"Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism...\"</p> <p><strong>8.52pm:</strong> AK47s are bad; letting gays and lesbians visit people in hospital is good.</p> <p><strong>8.54pm:</strong> And now the stirring closing passage. \"You have shown what history teaches us -- that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington. Change comes to Washington.\" And up to the crescendo, which is this:</p> <p>\"...It is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream. The men and women who gathered there could've heard many things. They could've heard words of anger and discord. They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred. But what the people heard instead -- people of every creed and color, from every walk of life -- is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked. That together, our dreams can be one. 'We cannot walk alone,' the preacher cried. 'And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back.' America, we cannot turn back. Not with so much work to be done. Not with so many children to educate, and so many veterans to care for. Not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save. Not with so many families to protect, and so many lives to mend. America, we cannot turn back. We cannot walk alone. At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future. Let us keep that promise -- that American promise -- and in the words of Scripture, hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.\"</p> <p>In accordance with US law, they play him out with <a href=\"http://www.cowboylyrics.com/lyrics/brooks-and-dunn/only-in-america-4920.html\">this horrible country rock song</a>.</p> <p><strong>9pm:</strong> Here's Joe Biden and Michelle and the kids and various others. FIREWORKS! Streamers, and a patriotic rock-orchestral medley. Top marks for the fireworks, no marks for the classical rock.</p> <p><strong>9.15pm:</strong> So how'd it go? Ezra Klein <a href=\"http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=08&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=obama_1\">puts it well</a>: \"This has been the most aggressive speech of the week. And the most substantive I've seen Obama give. It's not a thematic address: It's not about hope or values or the universality of the American experience of the illusory obstacles that divide us. It's concrete. It's about the failure of the Republican Party, and the promises of the Democratic Party.\" </p> <p><strong>9.20pm</strong> Stunningly, the McCain campaign doesn't agree. \"Tonight, Americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of Barack Obama. When the temple comes down, the fireworks end, and the words are over, the facts remain: Senator Obama still has no record of bipartisanship, still opposes offshore drilling, still voted to raise taxes on those making just $42,000 per year, and still voted against funds for American troops in harm's way. The fact remains: Barack Obama is still not ready to be President.\" But they would say that. </p> <p>Then again, after all the hype about a McCain attack ad that was going to be released tonight, we get <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.johnmccain\">this</a>: \"Too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed. But I wanted to stop and say congratulations \u2026 tomorrow we'll be back at it. But tonight, senator [Obama], job well done...\"</p> <p>...There was almost nothing more on Hillary Clinton, and plenty on Bush and McCain. (The way Obama shouted \"Enough!\", and some of his other remarks, still seems surprising, given how much we've read about his need to avoid the appearance of anger.) After a convention week devoted in significant part to working through the Democrats' internal issues, it was emphatically faced forward to the coming election battle. It's always more fun to listen to a lofty speech, but there were good reasons that Obama, for the most part, avoided loftiness; this speech's solidity and substance should prepare the party well for the high profile attacks they're going to endure all next week. And ultimately, of course, the fact of this speech \u2014 who was delivering it, and where \u2014 was as important as its content. </p> <p>Now all Obama has to do is win the election.</p> <p>====</p> <p>POSTSCRIPT</p> <p>Some immediate responses from the audience...</p> <p>\"I'm numb,\" said Maureen Gallaty, originally from New Orleans, who lost her brother in Hurricane Katrina. \"I teared up, and I'm no a cryer. The symbolism of him being here \u2014 it's like the whole Kennedy era came back, and now we have the same spirit as president Jack Kennedy, as Martin Luther King, alive and well... it gives me chills to say those words.\"</p> <p>\"No Democrat could be displeased with it,\" said Barbara Diffay, from Tuskegee, Alabama, who spent the last few days volunteering for the convention \u2014 shepherding people in and out of the Pepsi Center \u2014 in return for a ticket. \"He said everything that he needed to say.\"</p> <p>\"It was an enormous risk to do this,\" Jonathan Starr, a Hawaii delegate, told my colleague David Munk. \"And if it hadn't been such a success, it would have looked really bad.\" (Elana Schor has been questioning the crowd in more detail, and in the story she's busy writing now, shortly to be seen <a href=\"http://guardian.co.uk/uselections\">here</a>, she'll report that the attendees she spoke to seemed much more excited by the substance of Obama's speech than the theatrics \u2014 specifically, his tax plans, including the elimination of capital gains taxes for some small businesses, and his promise to \"finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East\" within 10 years.)</p> <p>====</p> <p>Thanks for reading and commenting. Now I've got to try to leave the stadium, which may take a number of hours.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337059033\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/8/29/1219983774155/theend.jpg\" alt=\"The end\" width=\"459\" height=\"329\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>",
  "<p>Maybe it hardly bears thinking about the morning of November 5 if Barack Obama has lost to John McCain the previous day. And it may seem perverse to think about it at all on a day like today, when Obama yet again commands the stage. But let's try to do it, right now, partly because the closeness of the polls suggests a narrow McCain win is a real possibility \u2014 partly because there has been so much underlying nervousness, as well as renewed exhilaration, among Democrats in Denver this week; and partly just out of common political prudence. </p> <p>So, why might McCain win on November 4? I think there are five main reasons to consider. </p> <p>The first is that these remain insecure times. The economic downturn has been very real in the US, in spite of yesterday's good growth figures. America's fear of rising fuel prices remains a potent electoral issue, laced as it now is with the fear that high oil prices are lining the coffers of America's enemies in places such as Russia, Iran and Venezuela. American soldiers are fighting difficult wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. McCain has a big poll lead on national security, foreign policy and ability to deal with a crisis. Every Russian tank rumbling around the Caucasus is harvesting votes for McCain \u2014 and the electorate may prefer to entrust the country to a leader with warrior credentials than take a chance on a visionary neophyte. </p> <p>The second reason why McCain might win is that this election is no longer about George Bush. America in late 2008 has a president who is a member of the political living dead. His name was barely mentioned at the Democratic convention this week. Along with Dick Cheney he will make an early appearance at St Paul on Monday at the Republican convention; after that, he's out of it. And with him may go many of his negatives. That leaves McCain some elbow room to fight the campaign his own way. McCain is a tough campaigner. He is also a smart one. He could do well in the televised debates. Compared with the midterms in 2006, the Democrats may find it hard to make this an election about Bush. </p> <p>Which brings us to reason No 3. American presidential elections are always close these days. Bush beat John Kerry with just 51% of the popular vote in 2004 and was neck-and-neck with Al Gore in 2000. In the electoral college Bush won by 286-251 against Kerry and by 271-266 against Gore. In the past four presidential elections \u2014 even the two that Bill Clinton won \u2014 no Democratic candidate has ever polled more than 49%. Democratic landslides have not been in fashion since 1964. This year's polls \u2014 in which Obama's average lead is now just 1.8% \u2014 are beginning to point to yet another 50:50 election. In these close races discipline, negative campaigning, and get-out-the vote organisation in the battleground states all matter. Over the years these have been Republican strengths, not Democratic ones. </p> <p>Recent polls also point to the fourth piece of good news for McCain: voters may be suffering from Obama fatigue. Obama is still fighting a campaign that is centred on self. His own story, his own vision and his own uniqueness are at the heart of his message. He consciously takes the whole weight of the campaign on his own slim shoulders, as he did again last night by taking his acceptance speech out of the convention hall and into the local football stadium, where he spoke against a backdrop of Greek pillars. Hubris? What if the nation that fell in love with Obama in the first phase of his great campaign decides he is yesterday's rock star as the real election nears. I think Obama is well aware of this \u2014 but voters don't just want big vision and soaring oratory. </p> <p>The final reason is simply Obama's race. The nomination of a black man to be president is not something marginal but something massive. It goes to the heart of whether America's self-identity is genuinely multiracial, or whether , in spite of everything, it is still white. This election isn't just about the possibility of a black president, but the possibility of a black first family. It asks white voters to see themselves embodied and represented by African-Americans, and to vote to be led by black people. This is something bigger than electing a woman leader would be, were that on offer. Race and slavery are America's original sin. The election of Obama would be, beyond question, one of the noblest gestures of historical redemption that Americans have ever been called upon to make. But that is precisely why it may not happen. </p> <p>So if, on January 20 2009, it is McCain, not Obama, who stands in the winter's air on Capitol Hill to be sworn in as Bush's successor, what would that mean for America and the world? The first thing to say is not to exaggerate the domestic or even the international impact; McCain would be the president of an already humbled, not newly triumphalist, conservatism. The economy would dominate his agenda. The next, umbilically linked point is to remember that McCain would have to work with a Congress in which, on the same election day, the Democrats are likely to strengthen their majority in the House of Representatives and secure firm control of the Senate. He could very easily find himself a weak president. </p> <p>Yet there could be no disguising the lessons for the Democrats, who would have lost three winnable presidential contests in a row. If Obama loses, there will not be another African-American nominee for at least a generation. Hillary Clinton might have the consolation that she would become, overnight, the overwhelming favourite to finally win the Democratic nomination in 2012. But who would bet against such a divisive figure not extending the losing streak from three to four? It would begin to look as if the only way of getting a Democrat into the White House would be as the result of an armed uprising. </p> <p>All that would be as nothing to the global dismay that would greet the election of President McCain. Much of the world would simply despair of the American people \u2014 and so would many Americans. Anti-Americanism would have a new recruiting sergeant, and global confi dence in the democratic progressive project would suffer a historic blow. November 5 would be a bonfire night of the liberal vanities. I tend to think it won't happen that way \u2014 but it certainly could. And it may all be just 10 short weeks away.</p>"
