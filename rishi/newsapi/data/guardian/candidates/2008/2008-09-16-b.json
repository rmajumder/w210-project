  "<p>John Matshikiza, who has died aged 54 following a heart attack, was one of those polymaths who South Africa has an odd way of throwing up: film and stage actor, poet, journalist, broadcaster and political activist, he seemed equally comfortable in each of these roles. Though he could be critical of the way the country was run, his presence was somehow reassuring, so that in his company it was tempting to focus on the healthier aspects of post-apartheid South Africa. But it remains a violent place, and earlier this year he was assaulted during a carjacking outside his home. According to his family, he never fully recovered.</p> <p>Matshikiza was born in the Johannesburg township of Sophiatown, which was soon after demolished to make way for the white suburb of Triomf (Triumph). His father, Todd Matshikiza, wrote the music and some of the lyrics for the highly acclaimed King Kong musical, which went on to launch the careers of singer Miriam Makeba and trumpeter Hugh Masekela. He was also a founder writer for Drum, the pioneering, black-led magazine edited by Anthony Sampson, who was John's godfather.</p> <p>In 1961, soon after the Sharpeville massacre, the banning of the African National Congress (ANC) and other political organisations and a state crackdown on the media, Todd went on tour to Britain with King Kong, with his family following. In 1964, they went to Lusaka, Zambia, where Todd became head of broadcasting services for the newly independent country; he died in 1968. John returned to London to study at the Central School of Speech Training and Dramatic Art, Swiss Cottage, and, after training with the Royal Shakespeare Company, worked for the Glasgow Citizens Theatre company. </p> <p>He then combined stage acting in London with activism for the ANC: in the early 1970s he helped form Mayibuye, its cultural arm. He also lived in the US, Amsterdam and various African countries including Senegal, where he was culture director of the Gor\u00e9e Institute. In the 1980s he began to develop a reputation both as a film actor - notably in Cry Freedom (1987), Mandela (also 1987, a film for television in which he played Walter Sisulu), Leon Schuster's There's a Zulu on My Stoep (1993) and Hijack Stories (2000) - and as a lyrical poet. One of his earliest published poems, And I Watch It in Mandela (1974), was recently republished in a Nelson Mandela anthology: </p> <p>It is not for the safety of silence<br>That this man has opened his arms to lead<br>The strength of his words hangs in the air <br>As the strength in his eyes remains on the sky; <br>And the years of impatient waiting draw on<br>While this man burns to clear the smoke in the air.<br>There is fire here,<br>Which no prison<br>Can kill in this man;<br>And I watch it in Mandela.</p> <p>But his poetry went well beyond the laudatory, and achieved critical acclaim. Published works include South Where Her Feet Cool on Ice (1981) and Prophets in the Black Sky (1986).</p> <p>When Mandela was released in 1990, Matshikiza decided to return to the country he had not seen for 30 years. \"I was in London, with my mother and my daughter and my partner and we were all just bowled over by what was happening,\" he said afterwards. \"We'd been waiting all of our lives for this. That is all I can say. It was the whole of my life.\"</p> <p>By 1991 he was back in Johannesburg, where he soon won several prizes for journalism - he was a columnist for the Mail &amp; Guardian newspaper, wrote for Business Day and The Weekender, presented a BBC radio series and contributed to several British and American publications. His occasional returns to film included Wah-Wah (2005), Richard E Grant's exploration of the pre-independence Swaziland of his youth.</p> <p>Matshikiza's friend Ronald Suresh Roberts described him as \"the gentle ex-columnist\", because he tended to avoid the most pressing debates within the South African media, taking a left-field approach. In one Mail &amp; Guardian column, he wrote of the irony of South Africa becoming \"the great white hope of the black diaspora\". He went on: \"People speak comprehensible English here. Telephones work. There's a black president, a largely black cabinet, black empowerment and a black economic elite which, even though they may show signs of moral confusion and fallibility, nevertheless symbolise a significant advance in the worldwide profile of the black world.\"</p> <p>His great strength as a journalist was that he was never seduced by offers of power or patronage and was never afraid to poke barbs at the new elite. Another friend, Ismail Mahomed, said: \"John was betrayed in many ways by our new democracy simply because he refused to fall into the comfort zone of being a 'returned exile'. John was unafraid to speak out against a new breed of African opportunists just as much as he was unafraid to challenge old-style racists. I'll sorely miss his brilliance.\"</p> <p>Matshikiza is survived by his mother Esme, who lives in Cape Town, his ex-wife Eva Kavuma, and his two daughters Lindiwe and Fubi.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> John Matshikiza, actor, poet and journalist, born 1954; died September 15 2008</p>",
  "<p>The objective of the new version of Sarah's Law is praiseworthy. A pilot scheme in four counties, started this week, would give parents the right to ask the police whether or not a named person who has contact with their children is a known sex offender.</p> <p>Much of the publicity concentrated on single mothers checking on a new man they wished to take into their life, but the scheme goes far wider. It could apply, for instance, to babysitters, an uncle who takes his niece to a pantomime, a sportsman down the road who teaches a boy how to play cricket, even the house painter who might occasionally find himself alone in the house with one of the children.</p> <p>It is, in principle, a good thing that parents can be warned against paedophiles who have access to their children. But I am not satisfied that the scheme being piloted is the way to do it. Parents given the information they ask for will be under a strict obligation of confidence. They are to tell no one else. But is that humanly possible?</p> <p>Can a mother, told that her new boyfriend is a risk to her eight-year-old, keep it a permanent secret from those close to her? Are parents who learn that their daughter's piano teacher has a dodgy sexual past capable of restraining themselves from warning other parents about him?</p> <p>We are told that breaching the confidence may result in court action, even a criminal prosecution if revealing the information leads to public unrest and vigilante action. So a mother tells only her closest friend, but soon the whole neighbourhood knows and a bunch of outraged locals throw a brick at the sex offender's windows. The mother is prosecuted, convicted and imprisoned. A likely scenario? Of course not. There can be no realistic, effective enforcement of the secrecy imposed on parents.</p> <p>But there may be another consequence of the Sarah's Law approach - the possibility that a paedophile in danger of his identity and whereabouts being revealed may choose to hide elsewhere, out of reach of the police. That outcome is the very reason why this country, rightly, refused to copy the US Megan's Law, which has had the proven effect of driving serious sex offenders underground.</p> <p>In the US, the authorities are able to keep track of only 80% of convicted paedophiles. In England the police know where 90% of them are. Do we want to go down the American path? Which country puts children more at risk? The safety of children is paramount and we must be very careful not to prejudice it with a scheme, however well meant, which might have the opposite result to that sincerely intended.</p> <p>There is another more subtle and insidious reason for having reservations about the scheme. It can only increase the already unhealthy obsession that this country is developing about the alleged, though in reality much exaggerated, threat to our children from paedophiles.</p> <p>Only a few days ago, it was reported that adults who went for a walk in their local park were being cross-examined by park officials as to their motives - they were not accompanied by any children, so they must, according to the warped philosophy of our times, be suspected of being there for a more sinister reason.</p> <p>There are many other examples of similar absurdities. The law requiring criminal-records checks on adults who voluntarily helped out with children's activities has brought its own long list of ridiculous consequences; but the sad overall result has been a decline in adults volunteering, and not because they're all paedophiles evading scrutiny.</p> <p>Who suffers? Children, of course, deprived of sporting and fun activities, and especially children from low-income homes.</p> <p>The Sarah's Law scheme will spread suspicion and hurt among neighbours and friends; it will encourage women to regard men as potential paedophiles unless proved otherwise. No longer will the man next door offer to look after the kids for a couple of hours if mum has to go out, knowing or suspecting that she has been to get him vetted. And what kind of a start to a relationship is it when it begins with a visit to the police? \"Yes darling I love you and I trust you, but will you just wait a while, I've got to do a bit of checking.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Barack Obama's problem with Sarah Palin is easy to remedy, in just two moves. It's obvious that John McCain's surge in popularity is a result of a large number of women who would have supported Hillary Clinton turning to Palin. </p> <p>Obama must now wish he had chosen Clinton as his running mate (a wish no doubt enhanced when Joe Biden was stupid enough to proclaim that Clinton might have been a better choice than him). Indeed, had Obama picked her, McCain would probably not have been driven to search for the Nana Mouskouri lookalike.</p> <p>It is clear that Obama needs Clinton. And he can get her. All it needs is for Joe Biden to \"discover\" that he has a dicky heart. He's not obliged to have a full-scale heart attack (though it would help, publicity wise), just be told that there's a weakness, nothing life-threatening, but serious enough to preclude him from taking on a job, even one as undemanding as vice-president of his country.</p> <p>With Biden out of the way, Obama would be free to choose Clinton, and the women who deserted the Democrat cause will come pouring back. There is still time.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>This week Marcel saw Fragments at the Young Vic theatre in London: \"They last only 55 minutes in total, but these five mini-dramas were written by Samuel Beckett and directed by Peter Brook, so every minute was mesmerising.\" He saw The Duchess, starring Keira Knightley and Ralph Fiennes: \"Lovely frocks, women, crockery, hats, scenery and dogs.\"</p>",
  "<p>Zimbabwe's new prime minister, Morgan Tsvangirai, yesterday described Robert Mugabe as \"giving up\" and said that he would seek to govern by sidelining the beleaguered president whose own party is \"moving on\" without him.</p> <p>But, in an interview with the Guardian, Tsvangirai acknowledged that a climate of suspicion and mistrust between his own Movement for Democratic Change and Mugabe's Zanu-PF party would test his political skills as prime minister at the head of a coalition government of former opponents - some of whom are responsible for overseeing a vicious campaign of violence against other members of the new administration. </p> <p>That suspicion will not be eased by a warning from Tsvangirai that while Mugabe is unlikely to be called to account for his crimes, others in the Zanu-PF leadership - including some who may sit in the new cabinet - could face trial. </p> <p>\"I don't think Mugabe himself as a person can be held accountable. But there are various levels of institutional violence that has taken place and I'm sure we'll be able to look at that,\" he said. \"Let the rule of law apply ... We all cry for the rule of law, and if somebody's committed an offence he should be prosecuted.\"</p> <p>Under the power-sharing deal signed on Monday, Tsvangirai will head a council of ministers responsible for the day-to-day running of the country, while Mugabe will chair a cabinet of the same ministers to agree policy. The two factions of the MDC combined have a majority of one in both bodies. </p> <p>Tsvangirai acknowledged that working in the cabinet would be testing.</p> <p>\"There's an inherent suspicion, there's inherent mistrust of Robert Mugabe. It's understandable given his history, given his role. It's part of his legacy. But he also must understand that the future is not in the hands of Robert Mugabe. The future is in the hands of those who are advocating a change of direction because that is what is going to rescue this country. And I think he appreciates that,\" he said.</p> <p>Tsvangirai believes that heading the council of ministers, without Mugabe present, will allow him to sideline the president and govern directly by establishing a working relationship with Zanu-PF cabinet ministers who realise that Mugabe is part of the past. \"That's the whole purpose of having a council of ministers, that we are able to build a structured relationship outside the cabinet.\"</p> <p>But how is he going to control the council of ministers, many of whom have expressed contempt for him, or worse?</p> <p>\"It has to be a combination of personal cultivation of the team and to remove these negative attitudes. I'm sure we don't all have to agree. We will disagree. But at the end of the day we have to be motivated by what is the best interests of the country. I'll try to encourage that,\" he said. </p> <p>He acknowledged that some of Mugabe's ministers would seek to sabotage his leadership. \"Those will be sour grapes and I'm sure that anyone who engages in those kind of negative tendencies is holding the country to ransom. For what purpose?\"</p> <p>Mugabe's speech after the signing of the accord on Monday was not a good omen. The president dwelled on the past and gave only a belated and half-hearted commitment to make the power-sharing agreement work.</p> <p>\"That was vintage Mugabe at his best: unrepentant, defiant, even when he was giving up,\" said Tsvangirai. </p> <p>But he insisted that the future lay beyond Mugabe and that even his Zanu-PF party was moving beyond him. \"They see this old man who is defiant right up to the end. But he was also able to give the country a chance to rescue itself from the malaise and start over again.\"</p> <p>Many in the MDC are suspicious of compromise. They want to force out men such as the police chief, Augustine Chihuri, who said he would never salute Tsvangirai and who used his force as part of the assault on the MDC during the election. </p> <p>Tsvangirai sees it differently. \"Chihuri is just an individual. We're not talking about individuals here. We're talking about a process ... in which individuals have to fit a transformative agenda or find themselves not fitting with the spirit of the new agenda.\" Or as another senior MDC official put it: \"They have to salute us or leave.\"</p> <p>Tsvangirai referred back to the compromises at the end of white rule 28 years ago. \"We had a similar kind of people in 1980, those who refused to accept black majority rule has arrived and were even undermining the government, even going to the extent of sabotaging the government. In the process of change of this nature that is expected, but it does not stop a train moving forward,\" he said. </p> <p>But to move the train forward, Tsvangirai needs foreign money to rebuild an economy shattered by hyperinflation, plunder of the central bank, and a collapse in agriculture and manufacturing. The Europeans and Americans have earmarked about \u00a31bn in help but first they want to see that Tsvangirai really is in charge and that Mugabe really is giving up. </p> <p>\"They are sceptical because they mistrust Mugabe but they are also aware of their obligations,\" he said. </p> <p>\"I hope that they would look at this [agreement] as a positive step that should be supported ... because they were supporting the democratic struggle in the country.\" </p> <p>That struggle began in earnest eight years ago as the government seized white-owned farms in the name of righting a historical wrong. The process was so corrupt and botched that agriculture has collapsed as a result. </p> <p>But on this issue, Tsvangirai now agrees with Mugabe. The land will never go back to the white farmers. </p> <p>\"Don't underestimate the political and economic consequences of land but we want to solve this once and for all so that never again should land be used as a political tool,\" he said. </p> <p>\"We don't have any intention of going back to pre-2000.\"</p> <h2>Donors cautious about aid</h2> <p>Western donors remain cautious about the political settlement in Zimbabwe and want to see further progress before unlocking a \u00a31bn aid package. </p> <p>The US ambassador to Harare, James McGee, told the Associated Press that Washington was adopting a \"very careful wait-and-see stance\". \"If this works out the way Mr Tsvangirai hopes it will, we will be very willing to work with the people of Zimbabwe,\" he said.</p> <p>But while large amounts of financial aid will not be forthcoming until the US sees evidence that it is Morgan Tsvangirai and not Robert Mugabe who is in charge, McGee said the US would provide food to alleviate widespread malnutrition. </p> <p>EU foreign ministers said the government had to prove itself democratically before economic aid was resumed. They said the EU was prepared to \"adopt a set of economic support measures\" but only in support of \"a transitional government taking the steps to restore democracy and the rule of law in Zimbabwe\".</p> <p>The French foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, who chaired EU talks on sanctions, said: \"We are happy about what is happening there but it's not the end. It will be a long process.\"</p> <p>Australia's foreign minister, Stephen Smith, described the political settlement as \"modest progress\" and said sanctions against Mugabe and other Zanu-PF leaders would not be lifted until there was evidence of progress on human rights and economic reconstruction.</p>",
  "<h2>Unrestricted View</h2> <p>The View is the US model for ITV1's Loose Women - five female presenters of different ages, backgrounds and politics (including Whoopi Goldberg and Barbara Walters) shoot the breeze. You're right, it doesn't sound too taxing. Which is probably what John McCain thought last week when he ambled on to the show like a weary CEO at the company barbecue thinking he'd give himself a rest by flirting with the secretaries. He got a sharp lesson about underestimating women. Discussion included the separation of church and state, how to interpret the constitution, abortion rights and fibbing in campaign ads; McCain was left gaping like a landed fish. Will we see Loose Women's Carol McGiffin taking on David Cameron about the lack of substance in his policy proposals? You never know ...</p> <h2>Opinion poles</h2> <p>Women from across the continent convened on Amsterdam last weekend for the European pole-dancing championship, with competitors calling for the discipline to become an Olympic event. One spectator, Kenneth Tao, was convinced: \"I didn't see anything which I thought was erotic,\" he said. \"It was gymnastic.\" There is no record of whether he asked for a refund.</p> <h2>Hands off our Jordan</h2> <p>You know what it's like when you're bitching about one of your siblings and a non-relation joins in and suddenly you're like, \"Back off, that's my family you're talking about\"? This is how I feel about the New York Times' rather condescending profile of Katie Price, AKA Jordan. It's all there: the \"What is she famous for?\", the ups and downs of her bra size, her apparent willingness to lay her life bare. Well, back off, snotty NY types. Jordan may be a suspect role model for young women, but she is our suspect role model for young women.</p>",
  "<p>Despite the main finding in the latest report from the International Atomic Energy Agency that it \"has been able to continue to verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material in Iran\", the western media has focused on the issue of Tehran's lack of transparency over the IAEA investigation into recent intelligence allegations (Report, September 12). These involve missile re-entry vehicle projects and have been rejected by the Iranians, who have not even been permitted to see the documents upon which the allegations are founded.</p> <p>This week the US Congress is debating two non-binding resolutions which, if passed, will greatly increase the likelihood of military intervention against Iran. They call on the US president to \"increase economic, political and diplomatic pressure on Iran to verifiably suspend its nuclear enrichment activities\", and demand \"stringent inspection requirements\" of all goods entering or leaving Iran and an embargo of refined petroleum products to Iran. Although both resolutions exclude authorisation for military action, the embargo will require a naval blockade. Such a blockade could result in skirmishes with the Iranian navy which could rapidly escalate.</p> <p>The US is massing the largest armada of warships in the Gulf since 2003. Two aircraft carrier task forces are already there and a third was dispatched on August 22. French and British warships and carrier groups are also reportedly on their way. This has increased speculation that George Bush might authorise military attacks against Iran before the end of his term in office in January, or before the November elections to boost to the likelihood of a McCain presidency. <br><strong>Stefan Simanowitz</strong><br>Westminster Committee on Iran</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama and John McCain were fighting to achieve a decisive advantage on the Wall Street meltdown yesterday, a critical campaign moment that could determine the outcome of the White House election.</p> <p>Obama, at a rally in Colorado, sought to exploit what his team sees as a comment that could be potentially fatal to McCain's presidential chances: the Republican candidate's claim on Monday that the economy is \"fundamentally strong\". It is one likely to be played over and over by the Obama campaign in television ads.</p> <p>The Republican presidential candidate backtracked yesterday, conscious that his remark was at odds with the experience of many Americans suffering from job losses, rising prices and the mortgage crisis. </p> <p>Forced on the defensive for the first time since the arrival of Sarah Palin as his running mate re-energised his campaign last month, McCain did a media blitz, appearing on six morning television shows to say that he meant not that the American economy was strong, but that American workers were. \"I was talking about the fundamentals of America, which is the workers, their productivity, their innovation, their incredible performance for many, many years,\" McCain said.</p> <p>The Republican candidate, adopting a populist line, put the blame for the ailing economy on the \"excess and greed\" of Wall Street, which had \"betrayed\" the American working class.</p> <p>Obama, campaigning in Golden, Colorado, ridiculed McCain's explanation, saying McCain's team had \"sent him back out to clean up his remarks ... but McCain meant what he said the first time\". </p> <p>Obama said the election of McCain would mean a continuation of the economic philosophy pursued over the past eight years by President George Bush. </p> <p>Despite Bush having presided over the economic downturn, Obama has failed to establish a clear lead over McCain on the economy. McCain, enjoying a poll bounce as a result of Palin's popularity, has a lead in some of the battleground states, while Obama has only a narrow lead in others, often smaller than those held by the failed Democratic candidates John Kerry in 2004 and Al Gore in 2000.</p>",
  "<p>The departure of General David Petraeus from Iraq yesterday was accompanied by little of the triumphalism that marked previous attempts by the Bush administration to claim that a corner had been turned in this bitter war. Gen Petraeus's departing words were not sotto voce - they rarely are - but his assessment of the Iraq he leaves was cautious and sober. Having noted when he took command of US troops at the height of the civil war in February 2007 that he had described the situation then as \"hard but not hopeless\", Gen Petraeus yesterday amended this formula to say the situation was \"still hard but hopeful\".</p> <p>The surge of US troops has worked in cutting the numbers of civilian deaths over the last 18 months. According to figures compiled by the Brookings Institution, 3,500 Iraqis died violently in January 2007. This compares with 490 in June this year. But to claim as the Republican presidential candidate John McCain did that \"there are neighbourhoods in Baghdad where you and I could walk ... today\" is far from the truth and a reminder that Mr McCain could simply reproduce President Bush's worst mistakes in arguing that the war \"could be won\" by 2013. Barack Obama's critique of the surge is closer to the mark - that it failed to produce the anticipated political gains. But the bald fact is that the next US president will still have a major problem coping with the aftermath of a war that should never have been waged.</p> <p>Gen Petraeus can claim three achievements for his third and final tour. He recognised the significance of the Sunni al-Sahwa, the so-called Awakening movement, which developed autonomously and before the surge swung into action. The US general saw that it could be used productively. His policy of creating outposts of US troops reduced sectarian tension. And finally he recognised that there could be no military victory in Iraq. All that could be achieved was to prepare the ground for a political solution.</p> <p>But this has yet to be done, and there are inherent contradictions in a policy predicated on improving the state capacity of Nouri al-Maliki's government. The first is that government's manifest concern with al-Sahwa, which the US funds. As the Guardian reported this week, the Iraqi government is in danger of pushing Sunni tribal leaders back into the arms of al-Qaida by failing to take more Sunnis back into the security forces. The arrests of dozens of al-Sahwa leaders in Diyala province is cause for particular concern. The second is that the greater Mr al-Maliki's executive power becomes, the more he may be tempted to forge his own course, irrespective of US pleas to include the Sunni tribal leaders. This conflict is far from over.</p>",
  "<p>The cold war did not, for the most part, produce great novels. Over the last 40 years the Booker prize has been won many times by authors describing the consequences of empire in Australia, Africa and especially India. Not one of the winning novels concerned itself with the great struggle between Russia and the west, even though that struggle carried with it the possibility of a nuclear conflict that could have put an end to human life on the planet. Perhaps the great cold war books are still to come. In the meantime, we have John le Carr\u00e9, the pen name of David Cornwell, a former spy, whose books defined the conflict, at least in English eyes. His heroes have none of the simple bombast of America's cold war warriors, a product of the military-industrial complex that fought in Korea and Vietnam. They are uncertain, worried about class, loyalties and the role of a post-imperial nation caught between two imperial powers, neither of which can be trusted. There are no simple resolutions in Le Carr\u00e9's finest books. He wrote as a participant. Right and wrong become as opaque as a bleak Berlin dawn; the protagonists are spies, not ideologues - troubled men such as Alec Leamas, George Smiley and the mysterious Karla. Now he himself has confessed to his own doubts, a period when he worked for MI6 and considered defecting to Russia. \"I wasn't tempted ideologically,\" he says. He just wanted to see what it was like. His readers will be glad he decided to stay.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337697482\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1799177080_young-voters-Brightcove-16x9.flv\"/> </video>   <p>It is voter registration day on the campus of Kutztown university in Pennsylvania and a small but dogged group of students are trying to persuade classmates to sign up for the November presidential election. Decades ago they might have done so through bribery or, failing that, the fist; but these days the preferred method is humour.</p> <p>\"Voting is sexy and easy - register now!\" says a poster on the wall, alongside a pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey panel which students play blindfolded.</p> <p>Ostensibly, the voter drive is non-partisan, but it is clear from flyers on the table this group backs Barack Obama. They are part of the Students4Obama movement that has swept through more than 700 campuses across America in a revival of youth engagement that could be decisive on polling day.</p> <p>While the battle for the White House appears to be tightening, the campus remains one place where Obama can still expect overwhelming support. His dominance among young voters is clear in Kutztown, a state university that draws its students from across Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York.</p> <p>Obama supporters in Kutztown are organised through a cyber club on the social-networking site Facebook, which boasts 957 members. They hold regular rallies and parties, hand out leaflets countering the negative ads put out by the McCain campaign, and gently browbeat their fellows into signing up to vote. \"I believe Obama's genuine,\" says Erika Reinhard, 22, who devotes up to six hours a week on the campaign. \"He promises to reunite the country, and that's what we need.\"</p> <p>By contrast, there can be few positions in politics lonelier than that of the Republican student organiser. Zac Roberts, 21, is president of the Kutztown university body which boasts a membership of barely 30 out of 10,000 students and is thoroughly out-gunned by their Democratic rivals. Asked about the Republican Facebook group, he replies: \"That's a good idea. I might set one up.\"</p> <p>Such disparities are replicated among Pennsylvania's 780,000 student population, and in campuses throughout the US. It is highlighted by the work of Harvard University's Institute of Politics, which tracked the behaviour of young voters for the past eight years.</p> <p>It shows that while John Kerry enjoyed a 13-point lead on George Bush among 18- to 24-year-olds at this stage in the 2004 election, Obama is 23 points ahead of John McCain. The institute's researchers have found exceptional levels this year of engagement among the young, with 62% of young voters reporting that they were excited about the election and more than two-thirds saying they were definitely, or probably, intending to vote.</p> <p>It was not ever thus. When the Harvard project began in 2000, it found a mood among students that was apathetic, as reflected in a dismal turnout among 18- to 24-year-olds of 30% - well below the figure for all ages of 51%.</p> <p>Then came 9/11, a catastrophe that changed everything, says John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Harvard institute. \"There was a massive change in attitude, especially among young people, towards politics being important in their lives.\"</p> <p>The transformation was well under way before Obama hit the headlines. Della Volpe sees it as a profound generational shift among what many analysts call the \"millennial generation\" - those born in the 1980s and 90s and now reaching a political coming of age.</p> <p>He points out that this generation accounts for a quarter of Americans and is the largest in history - bigger, even, than the baby boomers. As such, Della Volpe is convinced it is large enough and enthusiastic enough to hold the balance of power in November.</p> <p>Peter Levine, who heads Circle, a nonpartisan research body at Tufts university that studies political engagement among young voters, traces the shift to a growing optimism. The deep distrust in politicians found among the so-called Generation X of the mid-60s and 70s, and their pessimism in their ability to influence affairs, has given way to renewed faith in politics as a force for good. Levine says: \"That makes them more motivated to support a candidate, as otherwise why bother? And it also has a fit with Obama, as he stands for making things better.\"</p> <p>Though the generational shift predated him, Obama has appropriated it as his own. Not only is his message of hope tailored to attract the young, but he has also constructed a campaign that talks their language.</p> <p>Howard Dean set a precedent in this regard with his primary run in 2004, in which he launched Meetup, an online campaign that drove thousands of first-time voters into his camp. The Obama campaign has built on that experience directly - its new-media director, Joe Rospars, cut his political teeth with the Dean campaign.</p> <p>Facebook tells the story. As of last night, Obama had 1,847,187 Facebook friends. McCain had 335,528. On top of that, the campaign has created platforms across numerous internet-networking sites, from Twitter to Faithbase and BlackPlanet. The beauty of the approach is that it is bottom up rather than top down, allowing young people to run their own Obama-supporting groups unfettered by central control.</p> <p>The technique has unleashed huge energy in the process at relatively little cost. Studies have shown that while it costs $60 to mobilise one voter through direct mail, and $30 through phone banking, it costs only $1.56 through cyberspace tools such as social networking sites, text-messaging and email.</p> <p>The impact was visible in the primaries and caucuses, where 7 million voters under 30 turned out, helping to trounce the hopes of Hillary Clinton by voting for Obama in a ratio of four to one.

  "<p>Ukraine was last night facing the prospect of further political instability and its sixth election in four years after the pro-western coalition formally collapsed.</p> <p>The government was made up of parties loyal to Ukraine's president, Viktor Yushchenko, and his 2004 Orange revolution partner, prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko. It fell apart after months of bitter quarrelling between the leaders.</p> <p>The nine-month-old coalition's collapse is a major setback, and comes amid rising tensions with Russia over the war in Georgia and Ukraine's attempts to join Nato. </p> <p>Its politicians are split between those who condemn the Kremlin's invasion of Georgia, led by Yushchenko, and others including Timoshenko who believe Ukraine should be cautiously \"neutral\" in its dealings with Moscow. </p> <p>However, the collapse has little to do with resisting Russia or integrating with the west - it is about who holds power. Yushchenko and Tymoshenko are likely to be rivals in presidential elections in early 2010.</p> <p>\"I officially announce the termination of the democratic coalition in the Verkhovna rada [lower house],\" parliamentary speaker Arseniy Yatsenyuk told MPs. \"It is yet another democratic challenge, but I hope that together we will overcome the challenge.\"</p> <p>The parliament now has 30 days to form a new coalition. Last night, however, indications suggested Tymoshenko was unlikely to form an alliance with the opposition Party of the Regions - making elections almost inevitable.</p> <p>The coalition split earlier this month after Tymoshenko's bloc and the Party of the Regions, led by the former prime minister Viktor Yanukovich, voted to strip Yushchenko of several powers. The president accused her of staging a parliamentary coup.</p> <p>The feud is further linked to which leader controls lucrative pipeline revenue on oil and gas shipped through Ukraine from Russia. \"It's not about being pro-western or pro-Russian. It's about who gets to sit on the pipe,\" one official remarked yesterday.</p> <p>\"Tymoshenko is only interested in what serves her. She wants a monopoly on power. She was pro-western when she needed the west's support. Now she trying to be pro-Russian.\" </p> <p>Yushchenko accused Tymoshenko of betraying Ukraine's interests, and suggested voters would not forgive her. He also claimed the Kremlin was trying to promote \"internal instability\", and aiding separatists in Crimea who wanted to return the ethnic Russian region to Moscow's control.</p> <p>But he did not foresee any military action by Russia. \"Will they repeat the Georgian scenario? For sure, no,\" he told the Associated Press.</p> <p>Polls suggest Yushchenko's Our Ukraine party would be wise to avoid an election. According to a recent one, Tymoshenko's party would get 24%, the Party of Regions 23% and his bloc less than 4%.</p>",

  "<p>Excellent <a href=\"http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=09&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=mccain_social_security_privati\">post</a> from Ezra making the point that this same \"Wall Street\" that John McCain wants to crack down on is not only the place he's never wanted to regulate in his career but is also the place that he also thought just recently should be handling Americans' pension accounts:</p> <blockquote> <p>McCain's argument is that Wall Street is built atop an unstable regulatory foundation and is shot through with most of the seven deadly sins. That the situation has been allowed to fester so long is evidence that \"people were asleep at the switch.\" Even so, McCain has consistently argued that much of Social Security should be turned over to...Wall Street.</p> </blockquote> <p>He really is just the biggest liar in modern political history. <br></p>",
  "<p>The estimable Bill Galston has <a href=\"http://www.thedemocraticstrategist.org/strategist/2008/09/post_13.php\">some sobering advice</a> for Obama at the Democratic Strategist. I usually don't think much of these kinds of interventions, which are often more designed to display the brilliance of the critic than anything else, but Galston assays some withering sentences (\"So far, while the McCain campaign has gone for the jugular, you've gone for the capillaries\") and makes some excellent points. Like this:</p> <blockquote> <p>First, you are not offering a coherent account of what has gone wrong with the economy \u2013 why it is no longer working for average families. People are anxious and bewildered; they want to know why jobs are disappearing, why incomes are stagnating, and why prices are soaring. If you don't offer an explanation, McCain's will carry the day by default: the problem is the corrupt, self-interested politicians in Washington; the solution is getting them \u2013 and government in general \u2013 out of the way.</p> </blockquote> <p>And this:</p> <blockquote> <p>Right now, regrettably, few Americans believe that you feel real passion about their economic plight and are willing to wage a tough fight on their behalf. It's your job to convince them otherwise, and you don't have much time to do it.</p> <p>A message is a thought not only sent, but also received and understood. If your hearers aren't getting it, it's not a message. The essence of political speech is functional, not aesthetic. It is a tree judged by its fruit, and the fruit is persuasion. Right now you're not persuading the people you need to persuade, and nothing else matters.</p> </blockquote> <p>And especially this:</p> <blockquote> <p>This is not about you alone; it's a matter of political responsibility. Millions of Americans have invested their hopes and dreams in you, and you owe it to them to campaign effectively, which isn't happening right now. Yes, the McCain campaign is replete with exaggerations, evasions, and outright fabrications. It's your responsibility to defeat them, not complain about them. If this means listening to advice you don't want to hear, and getting out of the \"comfort zone,\" so be it.</p> </blockquote> <p>Related to my previous post, Galston also explains why the Obama ads attacking McCain for surrounding himself with lobbyists is mostly a waste of time. Pretty strong stuff. Read it all.<br></p>",
  "<p>When he was running an insurgent campaign against then-Governor George Bush in 2000, John McCain had set himself apart from the GOP orthodoxy by supporting campaign finance reform and higher tobacco taxes, and by expressing scepticism about the role of the \"agents of intolerance\" among the Christian right. But he enthusiastically backed the party line on corporate deregulation. </p> <p>Since this weekend's Wall Street meltdown, McCain has reversed himself from positions he backed over his long career in the US senate. In Tampa, Florida, today, he promised \"an end to the reckless conduct, corruption, and unbridled greed that have caused a crisis on Wall Street\". How? \"Under my reforms, the American people will be protected by comprehensive regulations that will apply the rules and enforce them to the full.\" It's odd hearing talk like that out of any Republican, even an unusual one like McCain, and it is quite a departure from his statements in 2000.<br></p> <p>In a February 18, 2000, New York Times story, speaking about his role as commerce committee chairman:</p> <blockquote> <p>I do sometimes feel conflicted. As a conservative Republican, I have more faith in the marketplace then the bureaucrats, and the measures I have put forward are basically deregulatory in nature. But I have studied the speeches of Teddy Roosevelt and I understand the importance of these issues for the common man, who can get shafted by these big companies.</p> </blockquote> <p>At a Feb 15, 2000 GOP candidate debate in S.C., on gay Republican organisation Log Cabin Republicans:</p> <blockquote> <p>I disagree with the Log Cabin Republicans on gay marriages, on the \"don't ask/don't tell,\" on a broad variety of issues. But I agree with them on a stronger defense, lower taxes, less regulation.</p> </blockquote> <p>October 22, 1999, at a Republican debate in Durham, New Hampshire, he said America's economic power was a direct result of \"lack of regulation\" by the government:</p> <blockquote> <p>There's a number of reasons why we are experiencing this almost unprecedented prosperity. Among them are a lack of regulation, free trade, and most importantly, we are going through a revolution the likes of which the world has seldom seen. You could compare it to either the invention of the printing press or the industrial revolution.</p> </blockquote> <p>After seven years of the Clinton presidency, the US was enjoying a budget surplus and a seemingly endless economic expansion, so McCain's comments came in a much different context than what we're seeing now. But it's important to question how deeply committed he is to reigning in Wall Street excesses now, when for so long he was ideologically inclined to oppose government efforts to regulate business.</p>",
  "<p>Everybody has ideas about the kinds of ads (notice I say ads, not adverts; that would be because I'm American!) Obama ought to be running. Most of these notions are at least pretty good, some are great. I have my own thoughts, but I think it's more important to discuss the big picture here.</p> <p>In 2000 and 2004, Al Gore and John Kerry's campaigns both produced pretty lame ads. After Kerry's loss, there was much analysis among liberals about why Republicans were just so much better at selling their product (and hitting the other side). Intelligent people in my experience generally agreed that Democratic advertising was too cerebral, not as bare-knuckled.</p> <p>Then, last year, out comes this book by a professor named Drew Westen, called The Political Brain (see my review of it in the New York Review of Books <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/20217\">here</a>). Among a certain subset of liberal politics wonks, the book was a stick of dynamite.</p> <p>Westen demonstrated with clinical-study results and piles of data what many of us thought: that people respond to politics and politicians emotionally, not intellectually; they \"reason\" with their guts more than their brains. Democrats by and large hadn't understood this. Kerry, for example, actually thought that explaining how his healthcare policy would work would earn him points.</p> <p>As I say, Westen's book was a small sensation. It made him a star in liberal politics circles, got him blogging regularly at HuffPo. Bill Clinton praised it. It got one of those <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/10/arts/10west.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin\">seal-of-approval write-ups</a> in the culture pages of the New York Times. </p> <p>It seemed certain that Westen's intervention had taken root. Mission accomplished. A Democrat wouldn't make that mistake again.</p> <p>A Democrat is making that mistake again.</p> <p>The Obama ad team, led by Jim Margolis, is making some tough ads all right, and they're not terrible, but they aren't memorable. They still aim more for the head than the gut. And what about humor? The only really memorable ad of this campaign so far has been McCain's Obama-Britney-Paris ad. Like it or not it worked. The Obama team's one attempt at being funny, the one about McCain not being able to use a computer that showed the 1980s-vintage cell phone, was really only funny if you already didn't like McCain.</p> <p>The American Museum of the Moving Image has assembled <a href=\"http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/2004\">this rather depressing collection</a> of Democratic and Republican ads since 1988. Have a look. It would be overstating it to say that the Republican ads are all excellent and the Democratic ads all stink, but the GOP ads as a whole pack a greater punch (and notice how often the GOP ads set the terms and the Democratic ones respond to terms the GOP has set, which is happening this year again).</p> <p>Gawker <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5050195/the-saddest-video-in-the-world\">called</a> the slide show \"the history of how the United States of America killed itself.\" Watch the Dukakis ad they've highlighted, and note how depressingly similar it is to what we're hearing from Obama too often this year -- they're resorted to lies and baseless attacks and I'm not going to stand for it and the stakes are too high for America's families. </p> <p>Obama may still win and even has a very good shot at doing so. But it'll be in spite of the ads. The Westen lesson remains unlearned.</p>",
  "<p>This morning former HP CEO Carly Fiorina, who speaks for the McCain campaign on the talking head circuit, just gave the Democrats more ammunition and the Republicans a headache.<br><br>Earlier this morning she had said that Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, McCain's VP pick, is not qualified to be CEO of a major corporation like Hewlett-Packard, which Fiorina once led.</p> <p>On MSNBC, Andrea Mitchell asked her to clarify, and Fiorina dug herself deeper into the hole.</p> <p>\"Well,\" she said, \"I don't think John McCain could run a major corporation.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/F1Jr4YfSemk?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <object width=\"460\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/F1Jr4YfSemk&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/F1Jr4YfSemk&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object> </figure>   <p>The clip cuts off before she adds that neither Barack Obama nor Joe Biden could run a big company, either.</p> <p>Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor responded:</p> <blockquote> <p>If John McCain's top economic adviser doesn't think he can run a corporation, how on Earth can he run the largest economy in the world in the midst of a financial crisis? Apparently even the people who run his campaign agree that the economy is an issue John McCain doesn't understand as well as he should.</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>Barack Obama today sought to regain momentum in the presidential race by portraying John McCain as out of touch with Americans' economic pain as US markets struggled to recover from their largest single-day drop in seven years.</p> <p>The Democratic presidential nominee said McCain fundamentally agrees with conservative laissez-faire economic policies, and cautioned voters against trusting McCain's recent call for increased regulation during a campaign event in Colorado.</p> <p>Mocking McCain's proposal to appoint a commission to study the origins of the economic crisis, Obama said: \"We know how we got into this mess.\" </p> <p>\"What we need now is leadership that gets us out. I'll provide it, John McCain won't, and that's the choice for the American people in this election.\"</p> <p>Obama offered no new policy details today, but reiterated a proposal he unveiled in March that would toughen federal oversight of US credit markets and the financial services industry.</p> <p>He linked McCain with an economic \"philosophy\" that \"says even common-sense regulations are unnecessary and unwise\".</p> <p>\"What we've seen the last few days is nothing less than the final verdict on an economic philosophy that has completely failed,\" he said in Golden, Colorado.</p> <p>Over the weekend, Wall Street's Lehman Brothers went bankrupt and Merrill Lynch agreed to be sold to a competitor. Yesterday, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 4.4%, its worst day since September 17 2001, when the New York stock exchange reopened following the September 11 terrorist attacks. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate has risen and home values continue to sink.</p> <p>Polls have shown voters trust Obama more than McCain on economic issues, though McCain recently has eroded that lead. Democrats say the increasingly dire financial news will pull voters' attention from Sarah Palin and McCain attacks on Obama and toward economic issues.</p> <p>Jim Kessler, vice president of policy for centrist Democratic research group Third Way, said Obama should continue to remind voters that McCain subscribes to the Republican notion that, \"We need to let business alone and let business figure it out\".</p> <p>McCain has run as a Washington reformer who's fought to slash government spending, but has acknowledged that he is not strong on economic issues. Kessler said McCain does not seem comfortable talking about them, and also said the crisis \"takes the lustre\" off Palin.</p> <p>\"Palin is just a rank amateur on this stuff, he said. \"People aren't looking for someone who can skin a moose at this moment.\"</p> <p>Obama said borrowers should be subject to closer federal oversight. He called for stronger capital requirements for complex financial instruments such as mortgage-backed securities and other derivatives, and said mortgage brokers should be subject to the same regulatory guidelines as commercial banks.</p> <p>He would also \"streamline\" the US regulatory framework to end prevent agencies from overlapping and competing with one another, and pledged to crack down on manipulation of US securities markets.</p> <p>But today Obama focused on shooting holes in McCain's pledges to clean up Wall Street, noting that the Arizonan had long described himself as a proponent of deregulation.</p> <p>\"John McCain's newfound support for regulation bears no resemblance to his scornful attitude towards oversight and enforcement,\" he said. \"John McCain cannot be trusted to re-establish proper oversight of our financial markets for one simple reason: he has shown time and again that he does not believe in it.\"</p> <p>McCain's economic plan relies largely on making permanent George Bush's first-term tax cuts, cutting corporate and other taxes, and on eliminating congressional \"earmark\" spending that totals about 1% of the US budget.</p>",
  "<p>So <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/08/business/media/08msnbc.html\">Keith Olbermann and Chris Matthews get the bullet</a> as MSNBC news anchors because they did not pass the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0808/12594.html\">McCain-Palin test of balance</a>, which is currently the ability to stare a pig in the face and declare it to be a moose with lipstick when told that's what the GOP say it is.</p> <p>To a large extent, the much-derided mainstream media deserves to get in the neck for pandering to the whole shibboleth of \"balance\" that has disarmed its ability to show outrage at the outrageous.</p> <p>Last week saw the launch of <a href=\"http://spinspotter.com/\">Spinspotter</a>, a site intended to detect and objectively assess \"spin\" in news reports. Apart from the site's clunkiness that is the inevitable consequence of nerds using algorithms to assess political and literary attributes, the idea is fatally flawed.</p> <p>Its central premise, that there is an objective standard of truth in the news, is seriously shaky. In the real world, news is the product of conscious and unconscious choices made by editors and producers, reflecting all sorts of biases and pressures.</p> <p>Spin is a subtle quantum measurement, touched with subjectivity, and the major problem of modern American political discourse is outright lies, thudding down leadenly with crushing Newtonian gravity. <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/\">Factcheck.org</a> does a good job of catching those and does so impartially, flagging not only the whoppers but the economies that the campaigns make with the truth.</p> <p>Some American journalists refuse to join political parties or even vote in case it affects their \"objectivity\". This is laughable detachment from reality. If someone who has the professional opportunity to scan the news in such detail has not formed opinions about desirable political outcomes, they were born with a poker up their rectum or a large cavity in their skull.</p> <p>Spinspotter reveals some of this attitude, along with their bad grammar, in their criteria. For example, it explains that \"Reporter's Voice\" means: \"The reporter employs language (in the form of adjectives, adverbs, verbs or superlatives) that conveys meaning beyond the supporting evidence provided in the article, and begs the question: In who's [<em>sic</em>] opinion and by what objective standard?\"</p> <p>It goes on to give as an example:</p> <blockquote> <p>In the most hotly debated (superlative) campaign in years, Senator Obama delivered a soaring, inspirational (adjective) speech, while Senator John McCain, slowly (adverb) responded with a far less-eloquent (adjective) address, as he mightily (adverb) struggled (verb) to find a clear voice for his so-called \"straight talk express\".</p> </blockquote> <p>Nevertheless, it is true. Obama's speech was all those things while McCain's did limp. It is also true that Palin's speech was a masterpiece of oratory, which actually illustrates my point. It was laden with coded phrases that worked in that universe - think of the effect of the neutral, objective, spin-free phrase \"community organiser\" that had the audience's tasselled loafers stamping in two minutes hate.</p> <p>In the current state of American politics, there are considerable numbers of Americans who inhabit parallel universes, where the same words and phrases mean completely different things depending which dimension you live in.</p> <p>Would Spinspotter see \"tasselled loafers\" as a liberal smear? Just think of \"low taxes\" or \"right to life\", nice neutral phrases for a computer program. For a liberal, the right to life includes prisoners on death row, Iraqi and Afghan civilians, while low taxation is complex calculation that includes the rider \"for whom?\" For conservatives, one means anti-abortion while the other means, well, whatever the conservative candidate wants it to mean.</p> <p>For a liberal American, defending the US constitution means freedom from arbitrary arrest and cruel and unusual punishment, not to mention separation of church and state. For significant numbers of others, it has been digested down to a literalist interpretation of the second amendment and a vast expansion of the relatively new phrase \"one nation under God\" in the pledge of allegiance.</p> <p>Indeed one of the problems with America's allegedly liberal mainstream media is that it hampers itself with these bean-counting criteria of objectivity, which allows Fox News to parody it with \"no spin zones\", and \"We report, you decide.\"</p> <p>The spurious objectivity forces balance between genocidal regimes and their victims. It assumes that creationism should balance evolution, but does not have the courage to give equal time to the Flat Earth Society or those who think that pi is three.</p> <p>Journalists should have opinions, although they should back them up with facts. They should be able to look at the various candidates and decide that one is better than the other. If they find hypocrisy in any candidate - preaching one thing and then doing another - then they should unleash upon them all the superlatives, adjectives and adverbs it takes. Spinning balls hit their targets.</p> <p>You can't crusade \"objectively\" or in a \"balanced\" way. Mark Twain, HL Mencken and other greats of American journalism were not afraid to take sides against the forces of darkness - as they saw them. We remember them not only because they wrote well - and intemperately with lots of modifiers - but because history has often vindicated their choice of targets for their unbalanced vituperation.</p>",
  "<p>It is voter registration day on the campus of Kutztown university in Pennsylvania and a small but dogged group of students are trying to persuade classmates to sign up for the November presidential election. Decades ago they might have done so through bribery or, failing that, the fist; but these days the preferred method is humour.</p> <p>\"Voting is sexy and easy - register now!\" says a poster on the wall, alongside a pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey panel which students play blindfolded.</p> <p>Ostensibly, the voter drive is non-partisan, but it is clear from flyers on the table this group backs Barack Obama. They are part of the Students4Obama movement that has swept through more than 700 campuses across America in a revival of youth engagement that could be decisive on polling day.</p> <p>While the battle for the White House appears to be tightening, the campus remains one place where Obama can still expect overwhelming support. His dominance among young voters is clear in Kutztown, a state university that draws its students from across Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York.</p> <p>Obama supporters in Kutztown are organised through a cyber club on the social-networking site Facebook, which boasts 957 members. They hold regular rallies and parties, hand out leaflets countering the negative ads put out by the McCain campaign, and gently browbeat their fellows into signing up to vote. \"I believe Obama's genuine,\" says Erika Reinhard, 22, who devotes up to six hours a week on the campaign. \"He promises to reunite the country, and that's what we need.\"</p> <p>By contrast, there can be few positions in politics lonelier than that of the Republican student organiser. Zac Roberts, 21, is president of the Kutztown university body which boasts a membership of barely 30 out of 10,000 students and is thoroughly out-gunned by their Democratic rivals. Asked about the Republican Facebook group, he replies: \"That's a good idea. I might set one up.\"</p> <p>Such disparities are replicated among Pennsylvania's 780,000 student population, and in campuses throughout the US. It is highlighted by the work of Harvard University's Institute of Politics, which tracked the behaviour of young voters for the past eight years.</p> <p>It shows that while John Kerry enjoyed a 13-point lead on George Bush among 18- to 24-year-olds at this stage in the 2004 election, Obama is 23 points ahead of John McCain. The institute's researchers have found exceptional levels this year of engagement among the young, with 62% of young voters reporting that they were excited about the election and more than two-thirds saying they were definitely, or probably, intending to vote.</p> <p>It was not ever thus. When the Harvard project began in 2000, it found a mood among students that was apathetic, as reflected in a dismal turnout among 18- to 24-year-olds of 30% - well below the figure for all ages of 51%.</p> <p>Then came 9/11, a catastrophe that changed everything, says John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Harvard institute. \"There was a massive change in attitude, especially among young people, towards politics being important in their lives.\"</p> <p>The transformation was well under way before Obama hit the headlines. Della Volpe sees it as a profound generational shift among what many analysts call the \"millennial generation\" - those born in the 1980s and 90s and now reaching a political coming of age.</p> <p>He points out that this generation accounts for a quarter of Americans and is the largest in history - bigger, even, than the baby boomers. As such, Della Volpe is convinced it is large enough and enthusiastic enough to hold the balance of power in November.</p> <p>Peter Levine, who heads Circle, a nonpartisan research body at Tufts university that studies political engagement among young voters, traces the shift to a growing optimism. The deep distrust in politicians found among the so-called Generation X of the mid-60s and 70s, and their pessimism in their ability to influence affairs, has given way to renewed faith in politics as a force for good. Levine says: \"That makes them more motivated to support a candidate, as otherwise why bother? And it also has a fit with Obama, as he stands for making things better.\"</p> <p>Though the generational shift predated him, Obama has expropriated it as his own. Not only is his message of hope tailored to attract the young, but he has also constructed a campaign that talks their language.</p> <p>Howard Dean set a precedent in this regard with his primary run in 2004, in which he launched Meetup, an online campaign that drove thousands of first-time voters into his camp. The Obama campaign has built on that experience directly - its new-media director, Joe Rospars, cut his political teeth with the Dean campaign.</p> <p>Facebook tells the story. As of Tuesday, Obama had 1,847,187 Facebook friends. McCain had 335,528. On top of that, the campaign has created platforms across numerous internet-networking sites, from Twitter to Faithbase and BlackPlanet. The beauty of the approach is that it is bottom up rather than top down, allowing young people to run their own Obama-supporting groups unfettered by central control.</p> <p>The technique has unleashed huge energy in the process at relatively little cost. Studies have shown that while it costs $60 to mobilise one voter through direct mail, and $30 through phone banking, it costs only $1.56 through cyberspace tools such as social networking sites, text-messaging and email.</p> <p>The impact was visible in the primaries and caucuses, where 7 million voters under 30 turned out, helping to trounce the hopes of Hillary Clinton by voting for Obama in a ratio of four to one. The impact is also visible in Kutztown, where the student Obama group stages events with only minimal contact with the official Democratic campaign.</p> <p>It's not an entirely painless business, nor one devoid of anxiety. Erika Reinhard says she has found it harder since the summer break to get other students \"fired up\", as Obama would put it, about his candidacy. A sense of urgency has dissipated which the group is scrambling to reignite. \"A lot of people are supporting Obama, but I'm not sure they will make it to the polling booth.\"</p> <p>Her anxieties have some grounding. According to Circle, young people aged 18 to 29 are the most likely group to remain undecided about their voting intentions until election day.</p> <p>But the degree of jitters that remains on Obama's side is insufficient to cheer up Zac Roberts as he contemplates electoral oblivion for McCain, at least on this campus. \"Students are getting politically engaged again,\" he says mournfully. \"Young people don't understand what they are talking about, and I would rather they just didn't get involved.\"<br></p>",
  "<p>Sarah Palin <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Vote2008/Story?id=5789483&amp;page=2\">told</a> ABC's Charlie Gibson that in her \"personal opinion\" Roe v Wade should be overturned and that abortion laws should be determined at the state level. Her \"personal opinion\" is that abortion should be outlawed in cases of rape, incest and any time other than when the life of the mother is in danger. Palin's \"personal opinion\" is also that stem cell research is the moral equivalent of destroying human life and we shouldn't be doing it. Sarah Palin used the phrase \"personal opinion\" five times in the course of answering three questions.</p> <p>Why should we be interested in her personal opinions? Palin's answer is that when you run for office \"your life is an open book and you do owe it to Americans to talk about your personal opinion, which may end up being different than what the policy in an administration would be\". In other words, Fear not! A government run by Sarah Palin might bear no resemblance to what she actually thinks. </p> <p>Well it's my personal opinion that this doesn't make any sense. Palin is competing for a position in which she will have influence over public policy. What she owes to the American people is some sense of what that public policy will be, not a sense of things that may or not have an impact on policies that may or may not exist. If her personal opinions are just meaningless biographical curios, like a childhood love of cows or a first-rate flag collection, then we shouldn't bother paying attention.</p> <p>But if we're trying to figure out what that public policy might look like, Palin's personal opinions seem like a pretty good place to start - especially because, unlike <a href=\"http://www.votesmart.org/voting_category.php?can_id=53279\">Biden</a>, <a href=\"http://www.votesmart.org/voting_category.php?can_id=53270\">McCain</a> and <a href=\"http://www.votesmart.org/voting_category.php?can_id=9490\">Obama</a>, she has <a href=\"http://www.votesmart.org/bio.php?can_id=27200\">no national voting record</a>. We don't live in a parliamentary democracy -- we vote for individuals, not parties - and I somehow doubt Palin is suggesting that we take that page from Europe's playbook. All policy decisions are the products of personal opinions. Palin is either straining when she suggests that her policies would diverge from her opinions (where else would they come from?), or she holds her opinions in so little regard that she's willing to subordinate them for whatever poll-tested pap her campaign can come up with.</p> <p>It's of course true that the vice president is just one part of an administration, which is just one part of the federal government, which means you can't always get what you want. But if Palin believes the things she says with anything approaching meaningful conviction then she should have a moral responsibility pursue them. If she believes that abortion is murder, why on earth wouldn't she try to create public policies that prohibited the practice and prosecuted offenders? If she believes stem-cell research destroys human life, shouldn't she do everything in her power to stop it? Is it just terribly boring and pedantic to point out that these questions matter, even in a vice president?</p> <p>The relationship between the words that come out of Palin's mouth and the actions she has taken and would take in a position of power is a matter of genuine public interest. She lies with comic frequency about having opposed the bridge to nowhere (<a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/vcCandidateFeed7/idUSN3125537020080901\">she did not</a>), and McCain has <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122143893857134389.html?mod=special_page_campaign2008_mostpop\">lied</a> on her behalf about her commitment to earmark reform (her mayorship made an <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-earmarks3-2008sep03,0,2482434.story\">earmark junket to DC</a> an annual tradition). Her message is reform, but the New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/14/us/politics/14palin.html?_r=1&amp;em&amp;oref=slogin\">reported</a> that she ran her town and state like little arctic fiefdoms, complete with nepotistic hirings and firings and a splash of public intimidation. If reform is just her personal opinion - \"which may end up being different than what the policy in an administration would be\" - then please sign me up for more of the same.<br> Of course, another possibility is that Palin's opinions about the issues really don't matter. On this theory, she's an empty vessel - picked for biography and charm, and not for anything particularly persuasive or impressive about her opinions and accomplishments. This strategy strikes me as blatantly sexist (it implies that successful female politicians should be charming and folksy but their opinions don't matter), enormously cynical (it assumes American voters are stupid enough to fall for it) and probably accurate (McCain campaign manager Rick Davis: <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0908/13275.html\">\"This campaign is not about issues\"</a>). But that's just my personal opinion.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama and John McCain were fighting to achieve a decisive advantage today on the Wall Street meltdown, a critical campaign moment that could determine the outcome of the White House election.</p> <p>Obama, at a rally in Colorado, sought to exploit what his team sees as a comment that could be potentially fatal to McCain's election chances, the Republican candidate's claim yesterday that the economy is \"fundamentally strong\".</p> <p>It is one likely to be replayed over and over by the Obama campaign in television ads.</p> <p>The Republican presidential candidate backtracked today, conscious that his remark is at odds with the experience of many Americans suffering from job losses, rising prices and the mortgage crisis.</p> <p>Forced on the defensive for the first time since the arrival of Sarah Palin as his running mate re-energised his campaign last month, McCain did a media blitz, appearing on six early morning television shows to say that he meant not that the American economy was strong but that American workers were. </p> <p>\"I was talking about the fundamentals of America, which is the workers, their productivity, their innovation, their incredible performance for many, many years,\" McCain said.</p> <p>The Republican candidate, adopting a populist line, put the blame for the ailing economy on the \"excess and greed\" of Wall Street, which had \"betrayed\" the American working class.</p> <p>Obama, at a speech in Golden, Colorado, ridiculed McCain's explanation, saying McCain's campaign team had \"sent him back out to clean up his remarks ... but we know that senator McCain meant what he said the first time\".</p> <p>Obama said that election of McCain would mean a continuation of the economic philosophy pursued over the last eight years by President George Bush.</p> <p>In spite of Bush having presided over the economic downturn, Obama has failed to establish a clear lead over McCain on the economy. McCain, enjoying a poll bounce as a result of the Palin phenomenon, has a lead in some of the battleground states while Obama has only a narrow lead in others, often smaller than those held by the failed Democratic candidates John Kerry in 2004 and Al Gore in 2000.</p> <p>Neither candidate has yet put forward a plan for dealing with the economy that has resonated with voters, according to polling data.</p> <p>McCain today proposed setting up a commission comparable to the one into 9/11 to investigate how Wall Street ended up in crisis and how to clean it up.</p> <p>Obama described the commission as \"the oldest Washington stunt in the book - you pass the buck to a commission to study the problem\".</p>",

  "<p>In 1980 a reporter asked the then Republican presidential nominee, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/usa/reagan/0,,1234012,00.html\">Ronald Reagan</a>, \"How can an actor run for President?\"</p> <p>\"How can a president not be an actor?\" replied Reagan.</p> <p>The idea that the commander in chief must also be the entertainer in chief and that politics should have a simple, movie-like narrative is truer now than it ever was in Reagan's day so it was good to see BBC4 addressing this head-on with three programmes which dealt with the surreal spectacle and razzmatazz of US elections. In the first of these the satirist and Republican Party reptile <a href=\"http://pjorourkeonline.blogspot.com/\">PJ O'Rourke</a> examined how and why California - the richest, most populous and socially liberal state in the US - could end up being run by the Terminator. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0074t8m/\">The Man in the Mansion</a>, though not nearly as funny as one might have expected it to be, managed to convince you that <a href=\"http://film.theguardian.com/quiz/questions/0,,113133,00.html\">Arnie's election to office</a> was not symptomatic of some endemic airheadedness brought on by too much sunshine and orange juice but rather an expression of California's fierce independence and indefatigable American optimism. </p> <p>Presented by The Guardian's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonathanfreedland\">Jonathan Freedland</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/sep/13/television.television\">President Hollywood</a> began by drawing parallels between the last series of The West Wing and the present presidential contest. The apparently <a href=\"http://nhsblogdoc.blogspot.com/2008/02/barack-obama-and-matt-santos.html\">spooky similarities</a> between the fictional Matthew Santos, created by the West Wing's writers in 2004, and Barrack Obama turned out not to be so strange when, for the benefit of those who didn't know already, we were told that Santos was in fact based on Obama. Freedland then took us all the way back to 1960 and the contest between JFK and Richard Nixon, arguing that these two figures represented two Hollywood archetypes \u2013 the young idealist and the cynical plotter.</p> <p>It was only in the last 15 minutes of the program that a newer and far more sinister figure (at least from a European point of view) emerged: the president as can-do action hero. This is the no-nonsense, no-nuance guy we meet in the Harrison Ford movie <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118571/\">Air Force One</a> and in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/jul/02/features.review2\">the first and second series of 24</a>'s President David Palmer. Far more worryingly it is the Dubya we saw landing on an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf, the now notorious \"Mission Accomplished\" banner fluttering behind him. A couple of pundits speculated that post George Bush we would be seeing a new archetype, the President as moron. Perhaps we will, but I doubt that such a figure would do much box office: the American people have too much of an earnest respect for the post to wish to see their leader presented in that way. In <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00djm6s/\">Dinner with Portillo</a> the former great white hope of the Conservative party pointed out that a series like the West Wing could never have been made in the UK: we are simply too cynical about politics and politicians. So the Americans have Mr Smith, Dave, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44R5BapEdYY\">Andrew Shepherd</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_tzOBAMpkM\">Josiah Bartlet</a> and we get <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-Xvy1r4Pm8\">Sir Humphrey Applebly</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQoem1717X4\">Malcolm Tucker</a>.</p> <p>One of the striking things about Dinner with Portillo, which brought together Democrat and Republican pundits, was just how idealistic both sides were. Sure, the Republicans accused Hollywood of being the vanguard of liberal elitist conspiracy and the Democrats countered by pointing out that Rupert Murdoch owns a news channel and a film studio, but neither party truly questioned the sincerity or motives of the other. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/may/24/election2001.politicsphilosophyandsociety\">Joe Klein</a>, the author of Primary Colors and by far the most thought-provoking of Portillo's guests, conceded that on the whole when Hollywood presented us with the presidency it did so from a liberal perspective. However the dream factory also sold a more insidious and pernicious myth \u2013 one of green lawns, protestant churches, white faces and white picket fences. And it's this weird nostalgia for a pseudo-1950's US that makes the McCain/Palin ticket so powerful post 9/11. McCain, with his war record, white hair and famously volcanic temper is both father figure and action hero while Hockey mom Palin \u2013 folksy, crassly creationist, book-banning and militantly homophobic \u2013 reminds many Americans of what they want protected. Jonathan Freedland recently wrote an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/10/uselections2008.barackobama\">uncharacteristically angry article</a> in which he appeared to predict a Republican victory in November. I think he is probably right. From a Hollywood perspecive McCain and Palin simply have a more coherent narrative.</p>",
  "<p>Poor Al Gore <a href=\"http://archive.salon.com/tech/col/rose/2000/10/05/gore_internet/\">truly stepped in it</a> eight years ago when he described his involvement in government internet incentives as taking \"the initiative in creating\" the Web. Republicans gleefully inflated and mocked his apparent egocentrism, and Gore barely recovered before the election.</p> <p>Now John McCain's chief economic adviser may just have done the same thing.<br><br>McCain claimed on TV this morning that his chairmanship of the Senate commerce committee during the 1990s helped educate him on the financial markets - an assertion that prompted reporters to ask economic adviser Doug Holtz-Eakin for some examples.</p> <p>Holtz-Eakin responded, incredibly, by <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/jonathanmartin/0908/HoltzEakin_McCain_helped_create_BlackBerry.html?showall\">holding up a BlackBerry</a>. \"He did this,\" the McCain adviser said.</p> <blockquote> <p>Telecommunications of the United States is a premier innovation in the past 15 years, comes right through the Commerce committee so you're looking at the miracle John McCain helped create and that's what he did.</p> </blockquote> <p>According to that logic, McCain must have been at least partially responsible for other technological innovations that emerged while he sat on the Commerce committee. Senator, thanks for the iPod and \"<a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/2008/06/09/mccain-its-a-google/\">a Google</a>\"!</p> <p>(But wait: This also means Obama was responsible for the lack of homeland-security breaches in the US since 2004, right? Because he's been on the Senate homeland security committee...)</p> <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Thanks to commenter USA4Obama for pointing out <a href=\"http://www.sciencedebate2008.com/www/index.php?id=42\">McCain's responses</a> to the policy site sciencedebate2008.com, in which he claims to -- wait for it -- have helped create wi-fi. Seriously.</p> <blockquote> <p>Under my guiding hand, Congress developed a wireless spectrum policy that spurred the rapid rise of mobile phones and Wi-Fi technology that enables Americans to surf the web while sitting at a coffee shop, airport lounge, or public park.</p> </blockquote> <p>Now, McCain has a point: he is a chief sponsor of <a href=\"http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/news/article.php/3515206\">a congressional plan</a> to encourage rural communities to develop faster broadband networks. </p> <p>But does he really want to remind folks of <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/news/special_reports/mojo_400/communications.html\">Global Crossing</a>, the telecom company that <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2002/01/28/companies/globalcrossing/\">went bankrupt</a> on dreams of expanding the wireless spectrum? </p> <p>McCain chaired the commerce committee during Global Crossing's heyday, before it had to work out a controversial government settlement to unload its wireless rights, and the senator was <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/02_06/c3769068.htm\">among the bigger recipients</a> of the company's political donations. That in itself wouldn't be notable - except, as the Wall Street Journal (link only available with Factiva or Nexis service) reported in 2002, McCain got $30,000 from Global Crossing executives in a single day after sending regulators a favourable letter about the company.</p> <p>I guess you could call that a \"guiding hand\"...</p>",
  "<p>If ever there was a moment when the seemingly inexorable slide toward a John McCain presidency was halted in its tracks, it should have been Monday. But if Barack Obama is to be sworn in next January, he'll have to take advantage of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/16/marketturmoil.lehmanbrothers\">Wall Street's ongoing, slow-motion collapse</a> with an urgency and a sense of sure-footedness that has sometimes eluded him.</p> <p>The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and the fire sale of Merrill Lynch were driven in large measure by the deregulatory zeal of the Bush administration. Unlike the terrorist attacks of 9/11, which precipitated the last stock-market slide this ugly, what's unfolding now can be attributed directly to bad policy - policy that McCain is not only unlikely to reverse, but may not even understand.</p> <p>\"The fundamentals of our economy are strong,\" <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0908/13448.html\">McCain said at a rally</a> in Florida on Monday, though he did manage to acknowledge that \"these are very, very difficult times\". Indeed. Even as McCain spoke, the insurance giant AIG teetered on the brink of failure. On National Public Radio, Wall Street Journal economics editor <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=94617074\">David Wessel said</a> that if the decision by government regulators allowing Lehman Brothers to go under backfires, \"they'll go down in history as the guys who made the biggest blunder since 1930.\"</p> <p>McCain's economic cluelessness is not exactly news. During the presidential primaries, his main challenger, Mitt Romney, never tired of pointing out that McCain had once <a href=\"http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110007600\">told the Wall Street Journal</a>: \"I know a lot less about economics than I do about military and foreign policy issues. I still need to be educated.\"</p> <p>McCain bounced former senator Phil Gramm from his campaign this past summer after Gramm referred to victims of the current recession as <a href=\"http://www.washtimes.com/news/2008/jul/09/mccain-adviser-addresses-mental-recession/\">\"whiners\"</a>. But Gramm, who championed many of the deregulatory measures that helped lead to the current mess, is still thought to be <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/216912.php\">in line for a top job</a> in a McCain administration.</p> <p>To make matters worse, former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, who retains the status of secular sainthood, said over the weekend that <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601068&amp;sid=a.BrvyBtV8CM&amp;refer=home\">the country can't afford the $3.3tn in tax cuts</a> McCain has proposed without concomitant spending reductions - something the libertarian Greenspan would surely embrace, but which would prove politically toxic to McCain.</p> <p>Needless to say, McCain's running mate, Sarah Palin, is a hopeless cause. Last week, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/08/palin-makes-her-first-gaf_n_124792.html\">Palin defended the government's bailout</a> of the home-mortgage behemoths Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on the grounds that they had \"gotten too big and too expensive to the taxpayers\". Whoops. As private corporations, they were costing the taxpayers nothing. Now that the government has taken them over, they could wind up costing taxpayers plenty.</p> <p>But if the crisis on Wall Street is an opportunity for Obama, it's not necessarily one that's tailor-made to his strengths. Sixteen years ago, when Bill Clinton was challenging George Bush's father, he promised to <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/presidents/42_clinton/index.html\">\"focus like a laser beam\"</a> on the economy, and it was an effective pitch. Clinton enjoyed a well-deserved reputation as a policy wonk who had a 10-point programme for every conceivable problem. The rap on Obama is that he's more inspirational than managerial. And Obama's running mate, Joe Biden, couldn't be more different from Al Gore, the fellow-wonk who ran with Clinton. Biden is a windy, foot-occasionally-in-mouth pol who is better at inspiring affection - and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/12/us/politics/12biden.html?ex=1378958400&amp;en=e585457e1efeaecb&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink\">occasional laughter</a> - than confidence.</p> <p>What Obama should do is stress his centrist credentials, his competence and his judgment. On Meet the Press on Sunday, Rudy Giuliani levelled the ludicrous accusation that <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26702299/page/3/\">Obama's tax policies are \"socialist\"</a>, which prompted host Tom Brokaw to point out that Obama's supporters <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iEoh4tPLHPMMok875VIJDcq3FOKg\">include superstar investor Warren Buffett</a>, the very symbol of American capitalism. Obama needs to show us more of Buffett, as well as the Clintons and the moderate team of business-savvy Democrats who managed the economy so skilfully during the 1990s.</p> <p>\"This country can't afford another four years of this failed philosophy,\" <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5isOFwdbq0tsqatW6vJpkDRTI1gMgD9375FQ81\">Obama said on Monday</a>. Later, he added: \"I certainly don't fault senator McCain for these problems, but I do fault the economic philosophy he subscribes to.\"</p> <p>Up until now, McCain has showed remarkable success in separating himself from George Bush while continuing to embrace his policies. But this isn't the troop surge in Iraq, which gave McCain a chance to disagree with the deeply unpopular president on tactics while supporting him on strategy.</p> <p>On the economy, there is nothing to separate McCain from Republican orthodoxy in general and from Bush in particular. The only difference between the two is that Bush, God help us, may actually be more knowledgeable. Surely Obama can take advantage of that.</p>",
  "<p>During the Democratic primaries, feminists caught Barack Obama out several times in moments of minor disrespect toward women. Once he <a href=\"http://www.wxyz.com/news/story.aspx?content_id=13d1f66a-488b-46d3-9d3b-6632e0a8f1f7\">called a female reporter \"sweetie\"</a>. Another time he seemed a little too cavalier and patronising in a debate as he reassured Hillary Clinton that <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0108/Likable_enough.html\">\"You're likeable enough\"</a>. Then, after he said that <a href=\"http://www.swamppolitics.com/news/politics/blog/2008/07/obamas_lateterm_abortion_probl.html\">\"feeling blue\"</a> was an insufficient reason for a late-term abortion, several pro-choice activists complained, hearing a tone of vague sexism in the remark.</p> <p>Meanwhile, former vice-presidential nominee <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/mar/13/hellhathnofury\">Geraldine Ferraro</a> and former presidential nominee <a href=\"http://www.swamppolitics.com/news/politics/blog/2008/03/mcgovern_harder_to_elect_woman.html\">George McGovern</a> were suggesting to journalists that Obama's success stemmed in part from lingering sexism among Americans: they just prefer male candidates to female candidates. Feminist founder <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/08/opinion/08steinem.html?_r=2&amp;\">Gloria Steinem</a> even observed bitterly that black males got to vote in America before women.</p> <p>Given these bruising experiences, Obama should have expected the outcry that greeted his crack about the McCain-Palin campaign as an attempt to put <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0908/Obama_Lipstick_on_a_pig.html\">\"lipstick on a pig\"</a>. Republicans were bound to seize on the remark opportunistically, particularly since votes of disgruntled supporters of Clinton remain up for grabs.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPd4yk0x-eg\">video footage</a> of Obama as he made the comment shows him wiping his brow, which suggests that fatigue, not malice, motivated it. He made a political, not moral, mistake. He seemed not to recognise that the crowd could interpret the remark as a slight at Sarah Palin after her witticism at the Republican convention about the difference between a hockey mom and pit bull being lipstick.</p> <p>Obama had to stew in the juices of this gaffe for several days, with the McCain campaign eagerly stirring the pot. His magical political touch seemed to have failed him. CNN's Lou Dobbs pronounced the most charismatic Democratic presidential nominee in decades \"boring\".</p> <p>But then the McCain campaign made a mistake of its own by harping on the gaffe for too long. It rolled out a couple of whiny campaign ads about it that left even many conservative activists bored with the whole business. The appeal of Palin, as several commentators noted, is that she refuses to play the politically-correct victim, an image those ads undercut. </p> <p>Notwithstanding this flap, the buzz about Palin has discombobulated Obama and his running mate Joe Biden. Living up to his image as windy and gaffe-ridden, Biden made, with microphone in hand, an unwise aside - triggered apparently by Palin's popularity - that <a href=\"http://news.google.co.uk/news/url?sa=t&amp;ct=:ePkh8BM9EwLbwQq0w4ANYgubEFNqjgEr3LZUuJW5MIuMBGYEO1-cw6VxNfLir84KK517v9iAmgDP6RGe/1-0&amp;fp=48ce001767633f35&amp;ei=jcXOSJbTB4iuwAHn9cjPBg&amp;url=http%3A//www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/13/AR2008091302456.html&amp;cid=1246400170&amp;usg=AFQjCNHUXAiC2R6tBFj-ZhF-YA9rJTO1hQ\">Clinton would have been a \"better pick\" for Obama</a> \"than me\". One can only imagine the groans from Obama advisers after hearing that gratuitous remark.</p> <p>Biden also said in early September - in what was widely seen as a reference to Palin's decision to give birth to a Down syndrome child - that if Republicans care so much about disabled children: \"Why don't [they] support stem-cell research?\" Then he bumbled again on the campaign trail when he asked a local legislator, whom Biden didn't realise was wheelchair-bound, to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2mzbuRgnI4\">\"stand up\"</a> and receive a round of applause.</p> <p>Palin's interview with Charlie Gibson on ABC News, however, may give Biden some renewed confidence. Liberal pundits see in Palin's interview with Gibson a lack of depth that Biden could exploit in their upcoming debate. </p> <p>As Gibson gazed over his glasses sceptically, he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/sep/12/sarahpalin.uselections2008\">asked Palin about the \"Bush doctrine\"</a>. She appeared to draw a blank, which is perhaps a forgivable response, given that most Americans are foggy about the phrase's meaning. Does it mean a right to pre-emptive war? Or does it mean treating states that harbour terrorists the same as the terrorists themselves? Gibson himself may not even know its primary meaning, which explains his hedging phrase, \"as I understand it\".</p> <p>In any case, the moment could help Palin make the case that a McCain-Palin administration would not represent Bush's third term. \"After all,\" she might say, \"I don't even know what the Bush doctrine is.\"</p>",
  "<p>As the demise of two major investment banks leaves Wall Street in turmoil, Barack Obama and John McCain are manoeuvring to break through with voters on the complex issue of the economy.</p> <p>High financial anxiety in the American electorate offers an undeniable opening for both candidates. But in the 36 hours following the sale of Merrill Lynch and collapse of Lehman Brothers, neither Obama nor McCain has put forth new proposals to reform the financial sector.</p> <p>Instead the two presidential hopefuls have focused on undercutting each other's messages, with McCain trying to reassure voters and Obama blasting his rival as out of touch with ordinary people's struggles.</p> <p>McCain's claim yesterday that \"the fundamentals of our economy are strong\" brought on a fusillade of criticism from Democrats ready to link his seemingly detached perspective to that of George Bush.</p> <p>Addressing McCain's approach to the economy, Obama told voters: \"It's the same philosophy we've had for the last eight years \u2014 one that says we should give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else.</p> <p>\"It's a philosophy that says even commonsense regulations are unnecessary and unwise; one that says we should just stick our heads in the sand and ignore economic problems until they spiral into crises.\"</p> <p>Faced with a string of Democratic rebuttals to his claim of \"strong [economic] fundamentals\" - which he has made almost verbatim since November \u2013 McCain asserted yesterday that he was referring not to the state of financial markets but to US workers themselves.</p> <p>\"My opponents may disagree, but those fundamentals of America are strong,\" McCain said. \"No one can match an American worker. Our workers sell more goods to more markets than any other on earth.\"</p> <p>His statement is correct: US exports rose to $168bn in July, the most recent month for which data is available, while China's exports slowed. Still, China maintains a record-high trade surplus of more than $28bn while the US trade deficit recently hit a record high of $62bn.</p> <p>Both Obama and McCain have supported the government's decision to allow Lehman Brothers to seek bankruptcy. The Obama economic aide Jason Furman said the Democrat preferred \"a private solution\" for the investment bank, while McCain praised the decision not to hold taxpayers liable for Lehman's difficulties.</p> <p>Agreement on that point masks the candidates' divergent approaches to financial industry regulation. The oversight framework created in response to the Great Depression was broadly dismantled in 1999 amid intense lobbying by Wall Street, in a bill co-written by the McCain ally and longtime adviser Phil Gramm.</p> <p>Obama, by contrast, outlined a plan in March to strengthen capital regulations for firms that package and purchase the mortgage-backed securities that lie at the heart of the current crisis.</p>",
  "<p>Richard Cohen, longtime leading liberal McCain fan, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/15/AR2008091502406.html?hpid=opinionsbox1\">on the op-ed page</a> of today's Washington Post:</p> <blockquote> <p>McCain has turned ugly. His dishonesty would be unacceptable in any politician, but McCain has always set his own bar higher than most. He has contempt for most of his colleagues for that very reason: They lie. He tells the truth. He internalizes the code of the McCains -- his grandfather, his father: both admirals of the shining sea. He serves his country differently, that's all -- but just as honorably. No more, though...</p> <p>...McCain has soiled all that. His opportunistic and irresponsible choice of Sarah Palin as his political heir -- the person in whose hands he would leave the country -- is a form of personal treason, a betrayal of all he once stood for. Palin, no matter what her other attributes, is shockingly unprepared to become president. McCain knows that. He means to win, which is all right; he means to win at all costs, which is not.</p> </blockquote> <p>And here's conservative David Brooks <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/16/opinion/16brooks.html?_r=1&amp;ref=opinion&amp;oref=slogin\">on Palin</a> in the NYT:</p> <blockquote> <p>Sarah Palin has many virtues. If you wanted someone to destroy a corrupt establishment, she'd be your woman. But the constructive act of governance is another matter. She has not been engaged in national issues, does not have a repertoire of historic patterns and, like President Bush, she seems to compensate for her lack of experience with brashness and excessive decisiveness.</p> </blockquote> <p>It may not sound it on the basis of that one graf, but this is Brooks' anti-Palin column. He's off the bus. Understand how much Brooks used to admire McCain. Back in the 1990s he and Bill Kristol built <a href=\"http://opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=95000513\">an entire theory of conservatism</a> around the idea that McCain would embody it and make it manifest. </p> <p>Interesting that Kristol, after stating his preference for Joe Lieberman as McCain's veep, has nevertheless jumped feet first on the Palin bandwagon, while Brooks has now jumped off.<br></p>",
  "<p>Lebanon's rival political factions today began reconciliation talks that will include the issue of disarming Hizbullah, the powerful Shia group, which is required under a UN resolution.</p> <p>Leaders of 14 groups met at the presidential palace for talks led by the president, Michel Suleiman, as part of a peace deal reached in Qatar in May that ended sectarian clashes and defused a long-running political crisis.</p> <p>Given Lebanon's long-standing divisions, progress is expected to be halting. The Hizbullah-led minority coalition and the western-backed parliamentary majority remain at loggerheads over the fate of Hizbullah's arsenal.</p> <p>Hizbullah, which is backed by Iran and Syria, has resisted calls to disarm under a UN resolution that ended a month-long war with Israel in 2006. The group says its weapons are necessary to protect and defend Lebanon against Israeli attacks.</p> <p>\"I am completely confident that we can adopt a strategy that protects Lebanon based on our armed forces and benefiting from the resources and capabilities of the resistance,\" Suleiman said in his opening speech, referring to Hizbullah.</p> <p>Following his speech, the participants, including the Arab League chief, Amr Moussa, who was invited to attend as an observer, went into closed session. The process is expected to be drawn-out, with the first session likely to focus on establishing an outline for future sessions, before dealing with Hizbullah's weapons.</p> <p>Mohammed Raad, a senior Hizbullah MP who is representing the group, has implicitly rejected local and international demands to disarm. \"Defending ourselves is a right that does not require a decision. This issue can be debated in theory but the answer is clear and has already been decided,\" he said on Sunday.</p> <p>Saad Hariri, the son of the assassinated former prime minister Rafiq, heads the anti-Syrian parliamentary majority. He said such thinking reduced the upcoming dialogue to \"a mere photo opportunity\".</p> <p>Previous reconciliation efforts in June 2006 failed to make headway. One month later, Hizbullah's decision to kidnap two Israeli soldiers, triggering a 34-day war with Israel, revived the debate over Hizbullah's arsenal.</p> <p>Lebanon has teetered on the brink of civil war since the conflict with Israel. The most recent bout of fighting was brought to an end by the Doha accord in May that resulted in the election of Suleiman, the former head of the army, as a compromise president. A national unity government was formed that gave Hizbullah and its allies veto power over all major cabinet decisions.</p> <p>Beirut's Daily Star newspaper <a href=\"http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&amp;article_id=96030&amp;categ_id=17\">said in an editorial</a>: \"It remains to be seen whether the timing of Suleiman's presidency is a blessing or a curse. If he succeeds in getting Lebanon's squabbling political players to resolve their differences, he will go down in history as the best president this country ever had. If he fails on this score, nothing else he might accomplish will stop the Lebanese from destroying themselves.\"</p>",
  "<p>\"If I thought <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordonbrown\">Gordon Brown</a> going would be helpful to our election chances, I would tell him. But it would be irresponsible for him to go now. The financial system is in crisis and we would have a civil war, \" one passionate Brownite tells me over the phone. <br><br>I don't doubt his sincerity on either assertion: he would have the guts to tell the boss to walk (he certainly has the access) if he thought it right. But I talk to equally sincere politicians who have reached just the opposite conclusion; that Gordon must go at almost any cost if the government is to stand a chance of recovery. </p> <p>An ex-Brown ally I spoke to this week was in quiet despair about the boss's inability to take the good advice on offer, amid all the other advice he gets. The government isn't getting its message across, it's undermining loyal allies, it's mostly No 10's fault, he said.</p> <p>But my loyal Brownite's reasoning is worth listening to amid the chorus of complaint by the latest group of Gordon-Must-Go MPs to climb out of the trench and attack: Siobhain McDonagh, Joan Ryan, Jim Dowd, Barry Gardiner and others, up to and including George Howarth, who joined the campaign publicly last night. Mr Loyal offers an overlooked twist.</p> <p>Mr Loyal dismisses the widely-circulated claim that No 10 leaked the McDonagh letter to party general secretary Ray Collins (not to Geoff Hoon, as I suggested here the other day: my mistake) in order to detonate the rebels' mortar prematurely, well ahead of next week's party conference in Manchester.</p> <p>His version has the BBC's Nick Robinson accidentally triggering the drama when he suggested that the threat to Brown was receding. A key rebel then tipped off reporters that several MPs had written to Collins demanding nomination papers be sent out, which was rejected by Labour's NEC today. <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/16/labourleadership.labour\">Patrick Wintour</a> reports this morning that the issue may go to court.</p> <p>When one potential rebel who had been privately named \u2013 Ivan Lewis, so I am told - was challenged, he angrily denied doing any such thing. To sustain credibility and momentum McDonagh had to be outed and duly was on Friday. </p> <p>Her old chum Joan Ryan, who holds highly marginal Enfield, wheeled in, so did others in successive days. \"They had to act,\" says Mr Loyal. \"They wanted the mood music to be heavy, but not out of control.\"</p> <p>Why? Because the rebels know Gordon Brown will survive his party conference and soldier on. \"They've fired their bullets and missed.\" So the goalposts have been moved again. Brown must survive the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/glenrothes\">Glenrothes byelection</a> in his own backyard, probably on November 6, two days after the McCain-Obama showdown. There must a boost for Labour there, I expect they tell each other: either a Democrat or a Scotsman wins!</p> <p>Mr Loyal says that private briefings organised in the regions for councillors and activists by Derek \"Dolly\" Draper \u2013 ex-Mandelson aide, turned psychotherapist and born-again Labour volunteer \u2013 reveal the party in the country to be united behind the leadership and angry with the rebels. </p> <p>Yeah right, I hear you murmur. And I certainly meet a lot of disaffected Labour voters in my travels, admittedly mostly in London, though not just in medialand. But bear with me. Mr Loyal says there is no unity candidate out there to bind up Labour's wounds, not even a unity stopgap leader. Hence his talk of civil war.</p> <p>The overlooked twist is the fragility of Labour's biggest trade union ally, the recently merged Unite, which combines Amicus and the once-mighty T&amp;G union in uneasy partnership. </p> <p>\"It's in chaos,\" claims Mr Loyal. Why? Because the two joint general secretaries, Tony Woodley and Derek Simpson, don't get on and Simpson faces a legal challenge from the left about his hopes to stay on until retirement \u2013 he is 63 \u2013 without facing re-election.</p> <p>Simpson was the left's candidate in the battle to oust Ken Jackson - \"Tony Blair's favourite union leader\" - as leader of the engineers section of Amicus. </p> <p>Tory legislation requires trade union leaders to face re-election every five years unless they are over 60. Then they can go on until retirement. The same argument the left used against Jackson are now being deployed against Simpson: namely that union mergers mean that the constituency which elected him is not the one he now represents.</p> <p>The issue is now with the certification officer. If he decides that an election is required, Woodley could not allow his rival to seek a mandate from the whole Unite membership. He would have to join the race. There would also be a challenge from the left, perhaps Gerry Hicks, an activist in the south-west. </p> <p>None of this might happen. In fact, other chums assure me that Simpson, who is more supportive of Brown than Woodley, will be allowed to stay on until his 65th birthday \u2013 December 2009 \u2013 or face re-election only within his own Amicus section of Unite. No worry.</p> <p>Either way it might provide a very uncertain backdrop to any future Labour leadership contest; this an event where senior union leaders are normally expected to be on hand to provide a bit of sensible ballast rather than making inflammatory and competitive comments as seemed to be the case at the TUC last week. </p> <p>Unions provide ballast in hard times \u2013 it was the absence of an equivalent ballast added to Tory woes in their lean years. Brown may worry that Woodley will want to cut funding to Labour now that the Yates investigation has killed off other sources. David Cameron would like to squeeze the unions own funds. But that's another story.</p>",
  "<p>Since Sarah Palin was introduced to the world, the stories about her and her family \u2013 and the responses to them - have gone from the sublime to the ridiculous. The best this week was a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VELIG92GDXw\">video</a> in which a young African American male claims to be the real father of Bristol Palin's unborn child. All of this has served to create an extremely effective smokescreen which has momentarily obscured what really matters when it comes to the Republicans: whether or not John McCain is the right man to be the next president of the United States and what his agenda will be if he gets into power. </p> <p>The current soap opera would be funny were it not for the multitude of pressing issues that America is dealing with. Last week, the US government stepped in to rescue the ailing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; the investment bank Lehman Brothers has <a href=\"http://norris.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/15/and-then-there-were-two/index.html?hp\">filed for bankruptcy</a>; a top military commander <a href=\" http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5h-V6U5iqzJwqxGEb7C71taj-D3WQ\">has said</a> that he is \"not convinced [America is] winning [the military strategy] in Afghanistan\" and the <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm\">number of unemployed rose</a> by 592,000 in August. There's no doubt that in a couple of months, the next president will inherit a whole host of serious problems. Whether or not he will deepen or alleviate them will of course have a lot to do with his policies and agenda which unfortunately, under the Palin haze, are going undiscussed. </p> <p>Judging by the polls, not only have 34% of American voters who say that Palin makes them more likely to vote for McCain been seduced by this unexpectedly effective smoke and mirrors campaign, but the mainstream and liberal media \u2013 in particular those in the blogosphere \u2013 have also been baited into diverting their attention away from the real issues. According to the Pew Research Centre, coverage on Palin during the first week of September took up <a href=\" http://pewresearch.org/pubs/944/sarah-palin-news-coverage\">60% of campaign stories</a>, slightly more than John McCain got and much more than Barack Obama received. </p> <p>Considering that most people had never heard of Sarah Palin until a few weeks ago, the interest in her is to be expected. However, according to Pew \"the coverage of Palin's family and personal life exceeded that of her political resume by a moderate margin.\"</p> <p>The Republicans have criticised the liberal media a great deal recently. My criticism is certainly not of the same ilk, but I do believe that by over-zealously following and giving so much room to every single rumour and scandal, the liberal media has been complicit in making this election race into a partisan and highly divided clash of values and personalities rather than a battle of substance. The media is unwittingly boosting the Republicans by creating even more ammunition for the stirring up of Republican \"phony outrage\" that Obama has hit out at this week. </p> <p>But as Arianna Huffington <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arianna-huffington/sarah-palin-a-trojan-moos_b_124867.html\">wrote in the Huffington Post</a> last week: \"Every second of this campaign not spent talking about the Republican Party's record, and John McCain's role in that record, is a victory for John McCain\". Bob Herbert of the New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/02/opinion/02herbert.html\">concurs that</a> \"Palin is the latest GOP distraction. She's meant to shift attention away from the real issue of this campaign \u2014 the awful state of the nation after eight years of Republican rule. The Republicans are brilliant at distractions\".</p> <p>Since the end of the Republican national convention, there are hopeful signs that the after effects of the Palin Kool Aid are starting to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/sep/15/sarahpalin.johnmccain\">wear off</a>. The liberal and leftist media are becoming increasingly aware that, for a brief moment at least, they fell for the Republicans' distraction tactics. Like Barack Obama, they are now starting to say that \"enough is enough\". The Republicans will continue to talk about Palin, but Democratic supporters do not have to aid them in their efforts. </p> <p>This is why Obama has not talked much about Palin. He knows better than to become embroiled in the whole thing, as no doubt the Republicans hoped that he would. As the Republican's reaction to Obama's \"lipstick on a pig\" comment suggests, they are intent on drawing him into it, but he is <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/10/campaign.wrap/\">trying to bring America back to the issues</a>, saying that he loves America \"too much to let [the Republicans] take over another election with lies and phony outrage and swift boat politics.\"</p> <p>While refocusing on the issues makes sense to those who are sensible and actually care about the state of America, it seems that Obama will have to push hard on getting some voters to focus on them. McCain is waging a battle of distraction because he knows that there are a number of Americans \u2013 according to a recent <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/documents/postpoll_090808.html?sid=ST2008090801842&amp;s_pos=list\">Washington Post-ABC News poll</a>, 37% believe that personal qualities are more important than positions on issues - who will buy into it. The real battle between now and November 4 is between the voters who care about the issues and those who care about the personalities. </p> <p>Interestingly enough, judging by the boost that Sarah Palin appears to have given the Republicans, it's clear that many people do not rate John McCain very highly or believe that he is weak on his own. This means that he continues to have some very large chinks in his armour which Obama could exploit.</p> <p>It's time to take our focus away from Sarah Palin and put it back where it matters: on John McCain. Although we could <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/15/mccains-crowd-numbers-plu_n_126490.html\">be mistaken for thinking otherwise</a>, he is, after all, the one running for president.</p>",

  "<p>Ukraine's pro-western governing coalition has collapsed following a row over last month's war between Georgia and Russia. The Ukrainian parliament has 30 days to form a new coalition or call fresh elections.</p> <p>The alliance fell apart after infighting between the president, Viktor Yushchenko, and the prime minister, Yulia Tymoshenko. The two leaders were partners during the 2004 Orange Revolution but have become fierce rivals in the run-up to the 2010 presidential election.</p> <p>Yushchenko and Tymoshenko have engaged in a tug-of-war since Tymoshenko regained the premiership in December. They have traded accusations of corruption, incompetence and blocking each other's policies.</p> <p>The final straw came when Yushchenko accused Tymoshenko of acting in the Kremlin's favour by failing to condemn Russia's war with Georgia. She fired back, saying that Yushchenko's overwhelming support of Georgia had dragged Ukraine into the conflict.</p> <p>Tymoshenko then teamed up with the Russia-leaning opposition to adopt a law restricting presidential powers and boosting her own. Yushchenko declared the move \"a coup attempt\" and this month his party pulled out of the coalition.</p> <p>The coalition has teetered on the brink ever since and the speaker, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, today announced the government's collapse. \"I officially declare the coalition of democratic forces ... in Ukraine's parliament dissolved,\" he said. \"It is yet another democratic challenge, but I hope that together we will overcome this challenge.\"</p> <p>Some analysts predict a new governing coalition may involve the Russia-leaning Party of Regions.</p> <p>Since Yushchenko became president, Ukraine has made clear its aspiration towards membership of the European Union.

  "<p>General Ray Odierno, who takes over today as America's top commander in Iraq, played a key role in the \"surge\" strategy that pulled the country back from the brink of anarchy.</p> <p>As deputy to the outgoing General David Petraeus, Odierno carried out the detailed counter-insurgency campaign that poured US troops into Baghdad, drove al-Qaida insurgents out of areas surrounding the capital and clamped down on Shia extremists.</p> <p>The physically imposing Odierno, who will be promoted to four-star general, was a relative latecomer to the hearts and minds techniques of Petraeus. During his first stint in Iraq in 2003, when he commanded the 4th Infantry Division, Odierno was responsible for an area north of Baghdad known as the Sunni triangle, which included Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's home town.</p> <p>Few US military commanders or soldiers have much good to say about Odierno's aggressive tactics. His division's mistreatment of Iraqis and the heavy use of artillery appalled others within the country's armed forces.</p> <p>Army reporters and commanders said Odierno's unit - a heavy armoured division, despite its name \u2013 used an iron-fist strategy that may have appeared to pacify the area in the short term, but alienated large parts of the population. Some argue that the behaviour of the 4th Infantry Division helped create the insurgency.</p> <p>\"Fourth ID fuelled the insurgency,\" an army psychological operations officer told Thomas Ricks in his book on the Iraq war, Fiasco. An unnamed general said bluntly: \"The 4th ID \u2013 what they did was a crime.\"</p> <p>Odierno defended his troops' conduct by saying his men faced a population more hostile than in the rest of Iraq and had to act accordingly. The capture of Saddam in an underground bunker in December 2003 by Odierno's soldiers did little to dispel their cowboy image.</p> <p>The division's tactics contrasted with those of Petraeus, whose troops complemented searches of ex-Baathists' homes with meetings with tribal chiefs and community projects such as rebuilding schools and painting over old murals of Saddam. Petraeus went on to <a href=\"http://www.fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm3-24.pdf\">rewrite the US military's counter-insurgency manual (pdf)</a> and then took overall command in Iraq.</p> <p>Odierno was slow in recognising the strength of the insurgency at the start of 2004. At the time, he told reporters that the insurgents had been \"brought to their knees\". He was not alone in his overconfidence. A few months later, violence erupted and US forces all but ceded control of places such as Fallujah to the rebels.</p> <p>Later in 2004, the war took a brutally personal twist for Odierno. His son, Tony, an army lieutenant at the time, lost an arm to a rocket-propelled grenade. A West Point graduate, the younger Odierno left the army and went to graduate school in New York.</p> <p>For the older Odierno, Iraq was unfinished business. He returned in late 2006 and redeemed himself by recognising the failings of the US strategy at the time, recommending more troops at a time when the White House was under enormous political pressure to withdraw forces.</p> <p>\"His recommendations for what came to be known as the surge forces have since been proven correct,\" Petraeus said at a ceremony in Baghdad marking the end of Odierno's last tour in February.</p> <p>Odierno is now a convert to the Petraeus approach, telling troops it is their job to protect the population and that counter-insurgency takes time.</p> <p>\"Just as important as the surge was the change in our tactics, techniques and procedures that got us back out in the neighbourhoods,\" Odierno said in March. \"Our mantra was protect the population, protect the citizens of Iraq.\"</p> <p>In his new post he will answer to Petraeus, who will take over in late October as chief of US central command, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East, Afghanistan and the rest of central Asia. Odierno and Petraeus know each other well: for the final 12 months of Odierno's time in Baghdad his immediate superior was Petraeus.</p> <p>Odierno will be taking over at a time of relative calm. The surge has contributed to a big drop in sectarian violence and the newly confident Iraqi prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, is keen to see the withdrawal of all US combat troops by 2010, although he will probably have to settle for a compromise of 2011.</p> <p>George Bush this month announced a withdrawal of 8,000 US combat troops by February, but that would still leave his successor with about 140,000 troops \u2013 roughly the same as the pre-surge levels of last February. It will be Odierno's job to set the stage for an eventual US withdrawal.</p> <p>Odierno's margin for manoeuvre could depend not only what happens on the ground, but on who wins the US presidential race. He favours a \"conditions-based\" approach to judging US troop requirements in Iraq, taking into account levels of violence, the strength of insurgent groups and changes in the quality and numbers of Iraqi government troops. John McCain, the Republican candidate, backs such an approach, whereas Barack Obama, the Democratic candidate, wants a firm timetable.</p>",
  "<p>One Sunday last September, I left my apartment building at the top of Riverside Drive on Manhattan's Upper West Side, walked a block south and found myself at the corner of P Street and 17th Street, outside the Department of the Interior. Looking further, I saw a Metrobus stop for the 13A and 13G routes, which run between National Airport and the Pentagon; vending machines for the Washington Post and Washington Times; and John Malkovich, sitting in a buttermilk Mercedes-Benz turbo diesel sedan, wearing a gray suit with blue checks and a pale blue shirt. Behind the car passed traffic and pedestrians. In front of it were the awnings, lights, wheeled doohickies and several dozen millers-about that constitute a film crew.</p> <p>The film crew was for real - Joel and Ethan Coen were shooting Burn After Reading, the Washington, DC-set comedy that opened at the top of the US charts this weekend and is out next month in the UK - but not much else. The items of street furniture were props, of course. The traffic and pedestrians snapped into reverse at the blare of a bullhorn to resume positions fifty yards up or down the street. The Mercedes turned out to be a gas-burner done up as a diesel, and Malkovich turned out to be a stunt driver. The real Malkovich stood at a nearby bench, also wearing a gray suit with blue checks and a pale blue shirt. No, wait. The identically-dressed guy sitting ten yards beyond him in a canvas director's chair, reading a book about Freud - that was the real Malkovich. No question. Wasn't it? Perhaps this is how it feels to be a character in a Spike Jonze film\u2026</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337656994\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/09/15/burnafterjohn460.jpg\" alt=\"John Malkovich in Burn After Reading\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heeere's Johnny ... Malkovich spies someone watching</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The third man was indeed the real Malkovich, but the second, standing by the bench, was undeniably Malkovish. He had the actor's stubbly, balding head, intense, heavy-lidded eyes, broad nose, and down-turned mouth - though, unlike Malkovich's, his was often stretched into a bright-toothed beam. He was also considerably more built than the star. This was Mark Heskin, a 47-year-old working as Malkovich's stand-in, occupying the actor's space in the frame during the tedious minutes while shots are set up, and sitting around waiting to be called in the hours when they weren't. </p> <p>It was, Heskin acknowledged, a job that had its longueurs, but it was always interesting to be on a film set. Nor was it his only gig: he also worked as a daytime drama background artist - an extra on soaps - and pursued other acting work. For a decade starting from the mid-1980s, he had carved out a niche in the city making caricature dolls, stuffed figures based on people or photographs, equipped with bespoke accessories such as a Gap bag, or a pair of diving fins. Three feet tall, they sold for $150 each. Heskin showed how it was done on a public-access cable program, \"My Craft Show,\" and was profiled by the New York Times in 1992. In 1996, he moved back to his hometown of Portland, North Dakota, restored a couple of houses, then returned to New York last year. Now he has another side project.</p> <p>\"I don't invite many people,\" he said as he handed me a business card, \"but I get the feeling you'd get a kick out of it.\" On the card, which featured a color picture of a tree in the top left corner, were Heskin's name, address, and two words: \"Game Master.\" </p> <p>A couple of Sundays later, I made my way up to his fifth-floor apartment on the Upper West Side, a studio with a distant view of Central Park, if you crane your neck out of the window. Kevin, a corn-fed Yellowstone Park Ranger turned fourth grade teacher, was already there, and the chips, hummus and Canada Dry ginger ale had been broken out. The three of us were enough for the first game: Mad Gab. The concept was unfamiliar to me but easy enough to grasp. I picked up a card, read out A BLINK ON and, before too much sand had trickled through the egg timer, figured the answer as an informal reference to the 16th President.</p> <p>Other guests soon arrived\u2014Dez, a dark-haired, long-faced Irish lawyer; David, a young, goateed organist and doctoral candidate; Tom, short, bespectacled and in dungarees\u2014and our options increased exponentially. There was Password, then Catchphrase, then Scattergories. A gracious but competitive host, Heskin applied rules strictly but was generous in appreciating others' good play. Each game afforded an outlet for his performing abilities, though none so much as the last: Charades. Pulling a folded piece of paper from the hat, he read its contents, and frowned for a moment before beginning. Movie. Three words. First word: a buzzing insect; a wedding ring. Third word: milking a cow; a witch. Aha! \"Being John Malkovich.\"</p>",

Now, though, they're encouraging it, behind the scenes. Here's one (above) that's been airing on national cable news: it tackles the issue of John McCain's legendary anger \u2014 and goes where nobody else has dared in suggesting that the psychologically traumatising experience of years as a prisoner-of-war might not be the best preparation for the presidency.

McCain, meanwhile, was busy <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0908/McCain_camp_Fundamentals__American_people.html?showall\">arguing</a> that what he really meant by \"fundamentals\" was \"the American people\".

It's clear from the tone of the McCain campaign's response that they're doubtful about the story, too.
