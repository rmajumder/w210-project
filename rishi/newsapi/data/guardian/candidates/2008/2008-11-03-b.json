  "<p>Madelyn Dunham, the grandmother who was the anchor in the life of the child that was Barack Obama, died today just hours before polling stations opened in America's historic election.</p> <p>\"It is with great sadness that we announce that our grandmother, Madelyn Dunham, has died peacefully after a battle with cancer,\" Obama said in a joint statement with his sister, Maya Soetoro-Ng.</p> <p>\"She was the cornerstone of our family, and a woman of extraordinary accomplishment, strength and humility.\"</p> <p>Dunham, 86, had been in poor health for the duration of Obama's campaign - though he has often said that she followed politics avidly.</p> <p>Just two weeks ago, her grandson took a break from campaigning to visit her at her modest apartment block in central Honolulu after she fell and broke her hip.</p> <p>Some had seen the hiatus at such a critical time as a political risk to Obama, but the Democrat said that one of his greatest regrets was his failure to be with his mother when she was dying of ovarian cancer.</p> <p>He also admitted then he was not sure that his grandmother would live to see election day.</p> <p>In his memoir, Obama credited Dunham for giving him the stability he might otherwise have lacked, being raised without a father and by a mother who travelled between Hawaii and Indonesia. </p> <p>He returned from Indonesia to live with his grandparents when he was 10, and Dunham enrolled him in the exclusive Punahou school in Hawaii.</p> <p>Friends had described Dunham, who was originally from Kansas, as an example of strength and determination. She worked her way up for a clerical job to a management position at the Bank of Hawaii.</p> <p>Obama mentioned Dunham regularly on the campaign trail, often to emphasise his connection to the white Kansas heartland.</p> <p>But the Democrat also admitted that his relationship with his white grandmother was complicated. In his landmark speech on race last April, he acknowledged his grandmother, for all her strengths, had attitudes on race that at times made him cringe.</p> <p>Dunham's death leaves Obama with only one remaining link to his childhood in his younger sister, Maya, who lives in Hawaii.</p>",
  "<p>Joe the Plumber, Tina Fey's impersonation of Sarah Palin, Hillary Clinton's Puma supporters, Obama Girl, 3am phone calls, pitbulls and lipstick, \"my friends\", \"God damn America\", \"a noun, a verb, and 9/11\", tingling legs - the US election has provided an endless stream of colourful characters and memorable moments over the past two years.</p> <p>What's your favourite?</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama says that his grandmother has died.</p> <p>The Democratic presidential candidate announced the news in a joint statement with his sister Maya Soetoro-Ng. He said his grandmother, Madelyn Dunham, had died peacefully after a battle with cancer.</p> <p>He said: \"She was the cornerstone of our family, and a woman of extraordinary accomplishment, strength and humility. She was the person who encouraged and allowed us to take chances.\"</p> <p>The candidate learned of her death this morning while he was campaigning in Jacksonville, Florida. He planned to go ahead with campaign appearances.</p> <p>Late last month, Obama took a break from campaigning and flew to Hawaii to be with the 86-year-old Dunham, who helped raise him.</p>",
  "<p>I spent last week as <a href=\"http://nyrb.typepad.com/classics/2008/10/election-events.html\">part of a panel</a> discussing the US election in cities along America's west coast. The nightly discussions were full of excitement about what may happen on November 4. But they were also haunted by fear and nervousness. These audiences in city hotels and independent bookstores were probably as rational and secular as it gets in America. But the superstition and reluctance to tempt fate were electric. The tension crackled through every exchange. As a result, every conversation was hobbled by the subjunctive.</p> <p>Everyone assumed, rightly in my view, that <a href=\"http://pollster.com/\">the polls</a> were telling pretty much a true story. No one, though, wanted to be seen to be taking anything for granted. It never took long before someone from the audience would say something like \"I don't want to say when Obama wins but let's just assume that \u2026\" And then one of us panelists would respond in an equally circumlocutory way with \"Well, if there is an Obama administration, then it would be faced with \u2026 .\" No one dared to utter the words \"President Obama\".</p> <p>By the time our little caravan reached Seattle, our last stop and the last of these events before the election, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/oct/31/uselections2008-tomasky-kettle\">twitchiness</a> had reached bursting point. The English-\u00e9migr\u00e9 Seattle resident <a href=\"http://www.jonathanraban.com/\">Jonathan Raban</a> \u2014 whose <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v30/n19/raba01_.html\">knowledge of Sarah Palin's Alaska</a> has made him a star journalistic asset this year \u2014 said he was so nervous that he wished the English language could enable us to subjunctivise the subjunctive. Then later when I said, in answer to a question, that I actually believe the opinion polls and that therefore I was going to say that Obama would win, there was an anguished shout from Raban on my right. Don't say it, he cried \u2014 and the audience laughed and applauded. But I did say it. I said I thought Obama would win. And I still do.</p> <p>It is not hard to see why liberal Americans are <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/01/us/politics/01angst.html?scp=3&amp;sq=liberal&amp;st=cse\">so twitchy</a> lately. It's partly that the Democratic party has such a record of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory \u2014 Al Gore eight years ago, John Kerry in 2004. It's partly that the polls have been so consistent for so long now \u2014 something over 250 consecutive national polls have put Obama ahead in the contest with John McCain \u2014 that no one wants to celebrate prematurely or to be in any way complacent. And it's partly that the Republicans have always been brutally better at the ground game, perhaps <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-ground3-2008nov03,0,6488135.story\">until this year</a>, and that their voters and their lawyers and their elected officials will somehow find a way of stealing the contest from Obama. </p> <p>And more besides. Among African-Americans in particular there is the barely concealed voice of long and bitter experience that says someone somewhere will simply do something to stop them from doing what they have a right to do \u2013 whether it's cast a vote, elect a winner, or see a black man in the White House not as a waiter or a valet but as the commander-in-chief. That fear of dark forces is palpable.</p> <p>But so is something quite different \u2014 and that's the media's attempt to cover its backside as election day nears. If I have heard the words \"the polls are tightening\" once over the past weekend on the TV networks, I have heard them a hundred times. But each time I rush to the laptop and call up the data I find the same thing. The polls are not tightening. They are the same as they have been for weeks. If anything they are moving slightly in Obama's direction in the battleground states. When the media say the polls are tightening, what they really mean is that the polls may perhaps be tightening, and that it does no harm to media interests to say so, because it adds excitement and it allows us to say that we saw the backlash coming if it arrives.</p> <p>But I don't think it will. What is really happening, I think, is that Obama is going to win, and the Democrats are going to do spectacularly well in the Senate and House races too. But the mood here is like a cup final where your team is ahead with a few minutes to go. Those last few minutes seem to take forever. So near and yet so far. You overreact to every little event on the pitch as the time drags on. You scream manically at the referee to blow the whistle. Right now, Democrats are in that position. They just want it to be over now. But deep down, they don't really think that they will throw this one away. They just want the whistle to blow so they can cast off the subjunctive and <a href=\"http://www.suntimes.com/news/politics/1245951,obama-election-night-rally-daley-million-102808.article\">start celebrating</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Now, finally, the election is upon us. And now there is a chance for a once-in-a-half-century, perhaps even once-in-a-century political realignment. There is a chance to say goodbye to a politics built around tribalism and to move into a new chapter in American history.</p> <p>I'll keep this short. From the civil war onwards, Democrats controlled America's southern states and used their power to enforce a rigid apartheid system. Southern Democrats remained a vital part of any national Democratic coalition, and hence, even under otherwise radical administrations such as those of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, segregation was never seriously challenged. The \"peculiar institution\" of slavery was ended by the Yankee victory in the civil war, but the almost equally peculiar institution of race politics and the division of society into racial castes persisted.</p> <p>For reasons too convoluted to go into here, in the 1960s the national Democratic party embraced civil rights. And as the legal architecture of Jim Crow was dismantled and more African-Americans were registered to vote, reluctantly, at least at first, white southern Democrats began to reach out to these empowered constituents. Eventually African-Americans became a core part of the party's identity.</p> <p>The Republicans sensed an opportunity and began aggressively courting conservative southern whites aggrieved by these changes. And in one of the country's more remarkable transferrals of political allegiance, in the space of a couple electoral cycles Dixie went from being Democrat to being Republican. And it has remained so ever since. </p> <p>A core part of the Republican party's national coalition, in many ways the south has altered the GOP at least as much as the GOP has altered it. Lincoln's party went from being a party of moderate social reform to being almost revolutionary in its right-wing, conservative fervour; from being a party led by east coast Brahmins to being a party of born-again populists. It's the southern Republican party that so stridently pushed economic deregulation; that broke organised labour \u2013 in addition to opposing racial equality, historically southern political elites were notoriously anti-union; that eviscerated the minimum wage; that attempted to shatter church-state boundaries in a myriad of ways. It's the southern-dominated party that made opposition to abortion access a lynchpin wedge issue, and that has tried to do the same in recent years by touting a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. </p> <p>But, always, the centrality of race has remained, sometimes bubbling up to the surface, sometimes partially camouflaged. For decades, the Republican party has played an array of race cards to win and maintain power. In 1968, Nixon won the keys to the White House at least in part because of his appeal to what he later labelled a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_majority\">\"silent majority\"</a>, a conservative bloc of voters hostile to civil rights and eager to conflate black citizens with crime. In 1980, Reagan used images of African-American <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/19/opinion/19krugman.html\">\"welfare queens\"</a> to go after liberal defenders of government social programmes. Eight years later, Bush Sr used the notorious <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC9j6Wfdq3o\">Willie Horton ads</a> - photos of an African-American prisoner who had been furloughed from a Massachusetts prison while Mike Dukakis was governor, and who had then gone on to rape a white woman - to destroy his Democratic opponent. In 2000, Bush defeated McCain in the GOP primaries largely on the back of racially inflammatory <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/17/report-mccain-using-same_n_135699.html\">robocalls in South Carolina</a> insinuating that McCain had illegitimately fathered a black daughter. </p> <p>Eight years on, McCain, now the nominee, has done everything possible to cast aspersions on Obama's Americanness. While colour is never explicitly mentioned, it's the subtext in many of his and Sarah Palin's speeches, as well as in the numerous robocalls that have blitzed residents in southern states over the past two months.</p> <p>In the last few days, Pennsylvania - one of only two Democratic states from the 2004 election thought to be within McCain's reach - has been flooded by television ads once again seeking to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qyh-gGsib0w\">correlate Obama to the inflammatory preacher Jeremiah Wright</a>. Palin supporters have been filmed <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKUovpF9LWU\">holding toy monkeys with Obama signs</a> on them at her rallies. And a miasma of racist rhetoric hangs over much of the campaigning by local Republican party operatives in many southern states. One Georgia representative even <a href=\"http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/westmoreland-calls-obama-uppity-2008-09-04.html\">used the word \"uppity\"</a> in early September to describe the Ivy League-educated Barack and Michelle Obama \u2013 a term almost exclusively used by southern whites to refer to blacks who aren't content with accepting a lowly lot in life.</p> <p>We'll shortly know whether these tactics worked. If they did, it will be a cultural catastrophe. In poll after poll, Obama outperforms McCain on all the key issues: the economy, foreign policy, environmental issues, healthcare plans and so on. Polls show he beat McCain in all three of their face-to-face debates. And, as significantly, several polls that attempted to <a href=\"http://www.crystalair.com/content.php?id=32200809017\">measure the \"likeability\" factor</a> also gave Obama an edge. He's seen as someone more voters would prefer to have beers with, watch football with, be a teacher to their children. In other words, when it comes to both ideas and personality, Obama wins. </p> <p>If democracy is simply a competition of ideas varnished by a sense of personal charm evinced by its lead figures, Obama's the next president. But democracy is more than that. Unfortunately, tribalism has a powerful hold on the process. A significant number of people - despite an unprecedented year-long national conversation about race and culture and American identity - still have a gut-check problem with voting for a black man.</p> <p>If McCain wins, tribalism wins. The southern gamble, that race will always remain central to the nation's political decision-making process, that race will always trump economic common sense, pays off. And the American dream takes a rabbit punch to the kidneys that will take decades to recover from. </p> <p>If Obama wins, however, taking some southern states and bringing enough new voters to the polls that several Senate seats in the region also go blue, then at long last the possibility of a truly post-racial political system comes one enormous step closer to fruition.</p> <p>The stakes couldn't possibly be any higher.</p>",
  "<p>I've been hearing it all over the place: Yes, Barack Obama is up in the polls, but <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Vote2008/story?id=6031233\">will his lead hold</a>? Even though national polls have widened slightly in the final days of the campaign, concerns about the reliability of the polls in predicting the election of our first African-American president won't go away.<br> According to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_effect\">Bradley effect</a> (also known as the Wilder effect), white Americans will exaggerate their willingness to vote for a black when asked by pollsters. The theory is that some whites think that voicing support for the black candidate is more socially acceptable. (Tom Bradley was a former mayor of Los Angeles who narrowly lost the elections for governor of California in 1982 after being ahead in the polls. Doug Wilder was elected governor of Virginia in 1989, though by a narrower margin than predicted.)<br> The concern for Obama supporters is that if the actual vote falls two or three percentage points below some polls, then John McCain could still eke out a victory.</p> <p>But the most thorough analysis of the phenomenon finds that the Bradley effect disappeared more than a decade ago. Daniel Hopkins of Harvard <a href=\"http://people.iq.harvard.edu/%7Edhopkins/wilder13.pdf\">pulled together the data from 133 state-wide elections held between 1989 and 2006</a> (pdf). He found that before 1996 blacks \"performed on average 2.7 percentage points worse than their polling numbers would indicate.\"<br> Since then, however, racially charged issues like welfare and crime have become less important to voters, according to Hopkins: \"In 1995, 12% of Americans cited social welfare issues as the nation's most important problem, a figure that was just 5% by 2001 and 4% in 2004. In 1994, 29% of Americans cited crime as the nation's most important problem, a figure that had dropped to 9% by 2004.\" If so Bill Clinton and Joe Biden may have set the stage for Obama with the passage of welfare reform and crime bills in the 1990s. Biden's 1994 crime bill, which provided funding for 100,000 police in state and local jurisdictions, helped reduce national crime rates and took away the argument that Democrats were soft on crime. \"Law and order\" stopped being a political catch phrase and became instead the name of television's most successful cop show franchise.  The next year, Clinton joined with Republicans in Congress to reform welfare, placing time limits on benefits and requiring that recipients return to work within two years. Gone are the days when Republicans like Ronald Reagan could campaign on welfare queens living off the taxes of hard-working whites. Another reason the Bradley effect has disappeared is that whites are more familiar, and thus more comfortable, with blacks representing them in office. According to the Joint Centre for Political and Economic Studies, blacks are finding increasing success with all voters, not just urban minorities. By 2007, <a href=\"http://www.jointcenter.org/index.php/current_research_and_policy_activities/political_participation/black_elected_officials_roster_introduction_and_overview\">30% of black state legislators</a> served districts with mostly white residents.<br> Obama and his campaign managers <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5h9_GcRuwpbtaVtNPEL7fLTETiMpgD944F0R00\">understand</a> that familiarity breeds consent. The campaign has opened field offices in small towns in states like Virginia, North Carolina and even Arizona. Obama has paid an astonishing <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122549472220189573.html\">48 visits to Indiana</a>, compared to McCain's two stops, which is why that red state is now in play. Political observers who thought Obama was just throwing a head fake by competing in so many red states are now seeing the Democratic candidate threatening to win these states for the first time in a generation.<br> In recent weeks, Republicans have latched on the tax issue, arguing that Obama wants to spread the wealth - as in tax you and give it someone less deserving. While this line may have caught on with Joe the Plumber and his buddies, the political environment is not as conducive to such arguments as it once was. McCain and his allies are furiously trying to paint Obama as too scary to serve as president. But Americans are increasingly comfortable with black candidates in general, and Obama in particular. With polls showing him above 50% for the last several weeks, I don't think voters are going to show a last-minute change of heart when they step in the polling booth.</p>",
  "<p>Iran's nuclear programme has returned to the forefront of the US presidential campaign as John McCain tries desperately to scare voters in Florida and Pennsylvania from choosing Barack Obama. The Democratic candidate would, he says, <a href=\"http://iranvnc.com/en/floater_article/1/5728\">negotiate with Iran</a> over its nuclear programme. The Bush administration has saddled the next president with a bankrupt strategy and a crisis rapidly spinning out of control. Remarkably, there is widespread agreement among foreign policy experts of both parties that changing course and negotiating with Iran early in the next administration is essential to prevent a conflict that could engulf the entire Middle East. The barrage of slime from McCain hides the fact that he has no strategy to resolve the standoff and prevent the coming military confrontation. A vote for John McCain is literally a vote for war with Iran.</p> <p>Whichever candidate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/03/uselections2008-last-campaign-day\">wins tomorrow</a> will inherit a crisis of passive appeasement of Iran's nuclear ambitions. The Bush administration sought an economic stranglehold on Iran through UN sanctions but soaring energy prices wiped out any impact of the weak measures it attained at the security council. It faired no better in its attempts at political isolation, and far from halting Tehran's nuclear drive, the complete failure of the Bush administration's strategy has allowed Iran to accelerate its uranium enrichment programme bringing them much closer to a nuclear capability.</p> <p>Making the task more difficult, the next president will take over during a period of dramatic political transition in the key countries in the conflict. Not only will there be a new administration in Washington, but there will also be a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/28/israel-palestinians-middle-east\">new government in Israel</a> after fresh elections there in February or March and Iran has its own presidential elections in May. Throughout this period, Iranian nuclear scientists will continue to make progress on the uranium enrichment programme. </p> <p>Iran is still likely several years from a nuclear weapon, but that is not the only timeline at work and there is a real urgency to change the dynamic surround their nuclear programme. As Iran's uranium enrichment has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/31/iran-weaponstechnology\">continued unabated</a> during the Bush administration and new concerns emerge about the scope of its nuclear programme, even moderate Israeli officials are growing increasingly worried about Iran reaching a level of nuclear knowledge that is impossible to turn back. That threshold could be reached in little more than a year even though Iran would still be years from a functioning weapon. Unless the current trajectory of the crisis changes dramatically before that window closes, the Israelis may be compelled to act and fighting could spread across the entire region. Whatever one thinks about the merits of such an action, the next American president must do all that he can to prevent it. </p> <p>Negotiating without preconditions is the only pathway to a breakthrough that could prevent an Israeli attack. Requiring that your adversary accede to all of your demands before negotiations can begin is simply an excuse not to negotiate. Barack Obama has pledged that he would drop the ultimatum that Iran suspend its nuclear programme before he would meet with the Iranian leader to conduct negotiations to designed to bring Iran's nuclear development to a halt. This shift would allow senior officials from both countries to engage in preparatory meetings to establish a framework for negotiations and the parameters and likelihood of any agreement. This strategy is no guarantee of success, but Obama knows that America's current strategy is an abject failure and that we need to try something different, and he is not alone.</p> <p>A presidential election campaign is a terrible place to look for consensus across party lines, but that's just what has been happening among foreign and security policy experts of both parties on the question of negotiating with our adversaries. Recently, <a href=\"http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2008/09/16/five-former-us-secretaries-of-state-talk-to-iran/\">five former secretaries of state</a>, three Republicans and two Democrats, endorsed talking with Tehran. So has the defence secretary, Robert Gates. Even the new Centcom commander General David Petraeus said last month that \"you have to talk to your enemies\". </p> <p>The only one left out is John McCain, who bizarrely seems to think that too much presidential diplomacy caused the current impasse. Earlier in the campaign he derisively said of Obama's proposal that \"many believe all we need to do to end the nuclear programmes of hostile governments is to have our presidents sit down with leaders in Pyongyang and Tehran, as if we haven't tried talking to these governments repeatedly over the past two decades\". McCain's latest decent into dishonour warns that nothing less than a <a href=\"http://www.newstin.co.uk/related.a?edition=uk&amp;group_id=en-010-006245768&amp;similarFilter=US\">second holocaust</a> could occur if Obama prevails on Tuesday.</p> <p>All of McCain's incendiary charges hide the fact that, just like his secret plan to kill Osama bin Laden, he has not given any indication what he would do differently from the woefully inadequate efforts of the Bush administration to stop Iran's nuclear programme. After the catastrophe of the Bush administration, we do not have the luxury of repeating the same mistakes. Barack Obama promises the chance of averting disaster. John McCain only promises war.</p>",
  "<p>Election officials are braced for the biggest election turnout in US history tomorrow as voters finally deliver their verdict on Barack Obama and John McCain to bring to an end a gripping, two-year long campaign.</p> <p>The excitement generated by Obama's candidacy is expected to see between 130m to 140m Americans vote, easily eclipsing the 121m in 2004.</p> <p>Although election officials expressed confidence that polling booths across the country will cope, campaigners and political analysts expressed fears that the strain could see long queues and polling stations having to extend their opening hours into the night. The knock-on effect would be results in key states delayed.</p> <p>With all the major polls putting Obama well ahead, political analysts from both right and left said they expected him to easily reach the 270 of 538 electoral votes needed to win the presidency and many predicted a landslide, taking 350 or more electoral seats.</p> <p>The Washington-based Pew organisation, one of the most thorough and respected pollsters who accurately predicted the vote in 2004, today put Obama on 52% and McCain on 46%. RealClearPolitics, a website that averages out the main polls, put Obama on 51% to McCain's 44%.</p> <p>If the polls are borne out tomorrow, Obama would become the first Democrat since Jimmy Carter in 1976 to win 50% or more of the popular vote.</p> <p>Obama and McCain both began multi-state tours today in Florida, before heading towards their homes states today for what will be a victory party for one and a wake for the other.</p> <p>Obama told a rally in Jacksonville, Florida: \"After decades of broken politics in Washington, eight years of failed policies from George Bush and 21 months of a campaign that has taken us from the rocky coast of Maine to the sunshine of California, we are one day away from change in America.\"</p> <p>Disciplined enough to largely hide the relief that began permeating his campaign weeks ago, Obama was unable to avoid providing occasional glimpses throughout the day that he expected to become the 44th president.</p> <p>In an courteous gesture he might not have made if the race was closer, Obama said he wanted to \"congratulate McCain on the great race that he has fought\".</p> <p>Exuding confidence, he told a rally last night: \"The last couple of days, I've been just feeling good.\"</p> <p>As polling day closes in, he has inevitably become more reflective, telling CBS in an interview this morning that he had found the toughest part of the two-year campaign right-wing attacks on his wife, Michelle. He described this as \"just completely out of bounds\".</p> <p>McCain, at a rally in Tampa, Florida, boldly predicted he could still pull out a surprise win. \"The pundits may not know it and the Democrats may not know it, but the Mac is back. We're going to win this election,\" he said.</p> <p>The Democrats, as well as political analysts, were less sanguine than election officials today about trouble-free voting, saying that with 300,000 precincts across the country, there would inevitably be problems.</p> <p>Democratic officials complain that in some states Republican election officials are not opening enough polling booths in areas that are predominantly African-American in the hope that some voters, put off by the prospect of long queues, will go home without voting.</p> <p>Professor Michael McDonald, a specialist in elections at Virginia's George Mason University, said: \"I would not be surprised if we had long lines, potentially keeping polling places open longer on election day.\"</p> <p>He anticipated problems in states that had not allowed early voting in significant numbers, such as Virginia, Pennsylvania and Missouri.</p> <p>The Democrats are outspending the Republicans on advertising by at least two-to-one, and in some states four-to-one. They also estimated to have more staff and volunteers out, with 770 offices nationwide compared with McCain's 370.</p>",
  "<p>Talk of sending British forces to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/congo\">eastern Congo</a> is a diplomatic fantasy \u2013 and one that could quickly turn into a nightmare. Even if well-prepared, well-equipped troops were available (which is not the case given Britain's other involvements), a deployment would be neither sensible nor responsible without major commitments by other EU countries. As the French presidency has discovered, there is zero appetite across Europe for more African adventurism of this kind. Given the history, that is no surprise.</p> <p>The highly public weekend effort by Britain's David Miliband, France's Bernard Kouchner, the US state department's Jendayi Frazer, and the EU's Louis Michel to bang regional heads together is also unlikely to amount to very much in the longer term \u2013 except, perhaps, increased resentment at western hectoring. As monitoring organisations such as the independent Enough Project point out, Congo needs the world's \"sustained attention\", not political ambulance chasing. </p> <p>\"The immediate crisis should not distract the world from a larger truth: peace in the Congo, and indeed the Great Lakes region, requires a comprehensive strategy, robust diplomatic engagement, and a strong, capable peacekeeping force \u2026 Intermittent and inconsistent crisis management must be replaced by a broader effort to deal with the drivers of endemic insecurity and atrocities,\" the Enough Project said.</p> <p>The failure of the US and the former colonial powers to stay closely engaged since the 2006 election is a key reason why sporadic attempts to end Congo's epic tragedy continue to fail. Congo is in the headlines now. But that won't last \u2013 and neither will current levels of diplomatic activity.</p> <p>An emergency summit meeting of regional states in Kenya, if it happens this week, promises no solution as long as a principal protagonist, the rebel Tutsi leader, Laurent Nkunda, remains outside the tent. The main Rwandan Hutu militia, the Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), which includes some of the leaders of the 1994 genocide, also stands at one remove \u2013 but is central to halting recurring violence.</p> <p>The best hope of progress rests, as it did before this year's truce broke down in August, with persuading Rwanda's leadership to halt its support, direct or indirect, for Nkunda; and obtaining a similar change of heart by President Joseph Kabila and the Congolese army in respect of the FDLR and Mai Mai militias.</p> <p>But neither camp can be expected to back off for more than a few months unless root causes are addressed. When the next explosion comes, chances are the world will again be caught looking the other way \u2013 and Kouchner will again be left asking: \"Why? Why?\"</p> <p>It is easy to point the finger of blame, harder to find ways through the morass. The UN security council put too much faith in the 2006 polls and gave too little thought to nation-building. The UN's peacekeeping force was unable to stop the rebel advance \u2013 understandable, perhaps, given that war-fighting is not its job. But it also failed to protect tens of thousands of fleeing civilians, which was its bounden duty.</p> <p>More to the point, given that lasting solutions are home-grown, neither the Congolese nor the Rwandan governments have faithfully pursued pre-existing road maps on disarmament, integration (or \"mixage\"), transitional justice, resource-sharing, and institution building in North Kivu. According to the International Crisis Group, addressing these issues at the \"epicentre\" of the crisis is the only way of breaking the cycle of violence and dispossession.</p> <p>That may or may not happen. One immediate danger now, if Nkunda resumes his advance on Goma, is that the Congolese army will succeed in co-opting UN forces, thereby finally destroying their remaining credibility. One immediate priority, as Miliband and Kouchner said, is to deploy more of the 17,000 UN soldiers into North Kivu.</p> <p>But the misleading idea that European or even American troops could be on the way \u2013 that somehow the cavalry will ride to the rescue \u2013 should be dispelled. The UN and the African Union are still 12,000 men short in Darfur nearly a year into that supposedly crucial \"anti-genocide\" operation. There are none to spare for Congo. And candidly, there is no real will to find or send them.</p>",
  "<p>Democrats are increasingly confident that the US congressional election on Tuesday will see them extend their majority in the House of Representatives and reduce the Republicans in the Senate to an ineffective rump. Polls today suggest that the Democrats stand to take not only the White House, but will win seven or eight more seats in the Senate, where they already hold 51 of the 100 seats.</p> <p>A Congressional victory on that scale would help Barack Obama to avoid the fate of some of his predecessors, whose legislative plans have often been blocked by hostile Republicans.</p> <p>The Democrats, fighting the congressional race with almost as much intensity as the White House battle, poured millions of dollars into the campaign at the weekend. Obama diverted some of his funds into key Senate and House races in places such as Georgia. Democrats in Senate races had spent more than $67m, against $33.7m by the Republican candidates, as of the end of last week.</p> <p>Despite Congress reaching levels of unpopularity that rival that of President George Bush, voters surveyed by pollsters blamed the economic crisis on Republicans, rather than Democrats, who seem likely to hang on to the gains they achieved in the 2006 mid-term elections. The Democrats may fall just short of the 60 Senate seats needed to prevent the Republicans mounting legislation-blocking tactics such as filibustering.</p> <p>Larry Sabato, director of the centre for politics at the University of Virginia, said the Democrats should not become hung up on the 60 figure, and that it would not matter if they failed to reach it. \"The Republicans who are left are going to be irrelevant for the first year of the Obama administration. The Republicans will not have a major role to play,\" he said.</p> <p>He said the concentration on reaching the 60 mark was overdone, because some moderate Republican senators would probably vote with the Democrats, or face trouble being re-elected.</p> <p>Another potential problem facing a Republican rump, according to the political scientists Keith Poole and Howard Rosenthal, is that it could be more conservative than the existing Republican Senate group. According to their analysis, the Republicans most at risk of losing their seat are mainly those on the more moderate wing. A more rightwing Senate grouping might find it harder to attract voters from the centre ground in the congressional mid-term elections in 2010.</p> <p>The three Senate seats most likely to switch from the Republicans to the Democrats on Tuesday are Virginia, New Mexico and Colorado. Others the Democrats hope to take include Alaska, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Oregon.</p> <p>One of the biggest victims of a Democratic rout in the Senate could be Elizabeth Dole, the conservative senator for North Carolina. Norm Coleman, the Republican incumbent in Minnesota who famously clashed with the British parliamentarian George Galloway at a Senate hearing on Iraq, is facing a close race against the Democratic candidate, the comedian Al Franken.</p> <p>To reach the filibuster-proof 60 seats in the Senate, the Democrats will need to take Georgia, Kentucky or Mississippi. That is mainly why Obama announced last Friday that he would begin advertising in Georgia. The state may prove beyond him, but the big turn-out of African-Americans in the state, attracted by his candidacy, offers an outside chance of a Senate upset.</p> <p>In the races for the House of Representatives, where the Democrats have held control since 2006, the party is expecting to extend its lead by a further 25-plus seats.</p>",

  "<p>Exactly a year ago President Musharraf of Pakistan, in his capacity as chief of army staff, illegally declared <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/11/03/asia/pakistan.1-164654.php?WT.mc_id=rssfrontpage\">a state of emergency</a> and unceremoniously dumped most of the country's top judges. Nine months later he was forced to step down, and Asif Zardari, husband of former Prime Minister Benezir Bhutto, was subsequently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/06/pakistan1\">elected president</a>. His party \u2013 the Pakistan People's Party \u2013 had pledged to reinstate the deposed judges, but most have still not been restored to their posts. Is there hope for respect for human rights and the rule of law in Pakistan? </p> <p>The declaration of the state of emergency last November was frightening. Musharraf used his new powers under the emergency to summarily dismiss <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/the-statement-by-chief-justice-iftikhar-chaudhry-399166.html\">Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhary</a>, and most of the judges of the higher judiciary, and replace them with his own \"yes men\". Hundreds of lawyers and political activists who opposed Musharraf's actions were detained. </p> <p>The supreme court had increasingly been challenging Musharraf's government over the apparent misuse of executive powers. It was about to determine Musharraf's eligibility to contest the October 2007 presidential election while at the same time holding the office of chief of the army. Chaudhary had also taken a tough stance on hundreds of cases of disappearances, and had found against the government in several rulings. When the state of emergency was declared these cases were immediately shelved. Currently hundreds of cases remain pending before the supreme court. </p> <p>There was a brief glimmer of hope after the elections in February. A new coalition government moved quickly to distinguish itself from the old Musharraf regime by expressing its support for human rights. Significantly it signed the <a href=\"http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/a_cescr.htm\">international covenant on civil and political rights</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cat.html\">UN convention against torture</a>. It also made a public commitment to commute all death sentences, Pakistan has 7,000 people on death row, one of the largest number in the world. But sadly little has since been done since by Pakistan to put its words into effect. </p> <p>A weak and compliant judiciary has eroded the rule of law in Pakistan. The unique ability of an independent judiciary to challenge human rights violations, review abusive laws and provide redress to individuals who have suffered is essential. The new government has given some assurance that it will uphold the independence of the judiciary, but it has not followed through on this commitment yet. </p> <p>What this means in reality is that hundreds of cases of disappearances remain pending. <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=10893\">Amnesty International</a> has documented many of these cases, including that of Masood Janjua, a 45-year-old businessman from Rawalpindi, and his friend Faisal Faraz, 25, an engineer from Lahore. Both were apprehended nearly three years ago (30 July 2005) while travelling on a bus. Security forces have denied holding the men but Mr Janjua's wife Amina has presented the supreme court with an affidavit from five people declaring that her husband has in fact been held at various places of detention \u2013 including an army building called 501 Workshop in Rawalpindi \u2013 by the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency. </p> <p>These cases establish a pattern of security or other forces arbitrarily detaining people, blindfolding them, and moving them around numerous detention centres so they become almost impossible to trace. This is what Chaudhary and others were trying to address. </p> <p>This is a critical time for the new government of Pakistan. After a year of great uncertainty, there is an opportunity now to make a clear pledge to respect for human rights and the rule of law, starting with measures which uphold the independence of the judiciary and limit the President's authority in appointing judges. </p> <p>For its part, the international community, including the British government, can tell Zardari that it expects such assurances \u2013 including, critically, the upholding of the judiciary's independence \u2013 as an indication that the country has drawn a line under the events that began on November 3 2007. </p>",

  "<p>On the last full day of campaigning, the candidates for the US presidency are making a mad dash across the country in an effort to energise their supporters and win over undecided voters.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/republicans\">Republican</a> nominee, is visiting seven cities in seven states - including his home state of Arizona, in a reflection of his lagging position in the polls. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a>'s schedule is lighter only by comparison: the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/democrats\">Democrat</a> is visiting three tough battleground states where polls show him ahead but too close for comfort.</p> <p>McCain is fighting in part for the roughly 4-9% of the electorate who polls show still have not chosen a candidate, even as the presidential campaign nears two years old. </p> <p>\"My friends, it's official: There's just one day left until we take America in a new direction,\" McCain told a raucous, heavily Hispanic rally in Miami just after midnight.</p> <p>The Arizona senator's campaign manager, Rick Davis, told reporters last night that those holdouts could prove decisive for a McCain victory. </p> <p>\"If Barack Obama hasn't closed the deal with them after two years in the campaign and a year as the nominee of their party, maybe they're holding out for a good reason,\" he said <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1108/15193.html\">according to the Politico</a>. </p> <p>\"Now, maybe they just decided not to vote and they don't want to say that because everyone they know is voting. So we'll see. If we see the vote drop below 130 million, you'll know they didn't show up. If it goes over you'll know they came out, [and] I think that's a good chance for us to win.\" In 2004, 124 million Americans cast ballots. </p> <p>Obama, meanwhile, told radio talk show host Russ Parr that he was feeling \"peaceful\". \"The question is going to be who wants it more,\" he said. \"And I hope that our supporters want it bad, because I think the country needs it.\"</p> <p>By Saturday, 24 million had already voted in this year's race, with the Democrats apparently gaining an advantage, according to an analysis by Michael McDonald, an associate professor of government and politics at George Mason University. </p> <p>The exact results of the early vote will not be known until election day, but according to party registration statistics early voters in several key states have been predominantly Democrats. In Florida, for instance, of the 4.1m votes cast early, 45.5% have been by registered Democrats, 38% by Republicans and 17% other.</p> <p>Today's polls show Barack Obama well positioned for victory. He leads in every state John Kerry won in 2004, and is ahead deep into the territory won by George Bush that year. National polls show Obama leading by about seven percentage points.</p> <p>McCain's heavy travel schedule today reflects his effort to defend Republican turf against Obama's surge. Of the seven states he hits today, only <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/pennsylvania\">Pennsylvania</a> voted Democrat in 2004. He will also stop in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/florida\">Florida</a>, Tennessee, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/indiana\">Indiana</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/newmexico\">New Mexico</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nevada\">Nevada</a> and Arizona.

North Carolina and Virginia have long been in Republican hands, but polls show Obama is poised to retake them.</p> <p>The vice-presidential candidates have similarly exhausting schedules today. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a> will be in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/ohio\">Ohio</a>, Missouri, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iowa\">Iowa</a>, Colorado and Nevada, all states that Bush won in 2004. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a> will campaign in Missouri, Ohio and Pennsylvania.</p>",
  "<p>Chicago was today bracing itself for a huge and possibly chaotic street party as more than a million people were expected to descend on the city centre tomorrow night in anticipation of a victory for Democratic presidential hopeful, Barack Obama.</p> <p>Obama, who lives in Chicago, has planned a huge public party in Grant Park which is in the downtown area. The campaign issued more than 70,000 tickets for the event but they were sold out in a matter of hours. Nonetheless huge numbers are expected to come into the city anyway, prompting a major security clampdown, concern about public safety and some businesses to send employees home early.</p> <p>\"It's going to be surprising,\" Chicago mayor, Richard Daley told the Chicago Tribune. \"There are going to be a lot of people who want to come down to celebrate, we hope it's a million or more, that's realistic. It's going to be wonderful. Only the private event is ticket. You can be in the park and around it ... You think I'm nuts? You think I'm not going to invite people down? The mayor's not going to tell anybody not to come to this celebration, It's a historic event. If they want to be there, they should.\"</p> <p>Republican contender John McCain is meanwhile scheduled to hold a far more low-key affair in his home state of Arizona at the Biltmore resort and spa where he's expected to address roughly 2,000 people.</p> <p>The scale of Obama's event in Chicago is causing a logistical nightmare for the local law enforcement. Last Friday police superintendent Jody Weis warned, \"We can't have foolishness. We can't have mischief.\" </p> <p>And last week helicopters flew low over Hutchinson Field, the part of Grant Park where the rally will take place, while police scoured rooftops on downtown buildings. All Chicago police officers have had their days off cancelled for the night and local firefighters have been asked to have their personal equipment handy at home.</p> <p>\"We expect a good, supportive crowd, and we expect it to be a happy occasion,\" Obama's campaign manager, David Axelrod, has said. \"Whatever the result, we don't expect trouble.\"</p> <p>Even the US Coast Guard will patrol in Burnham harbour and on Lake Michigan, which borders the park. With traffic expected to be snarled and parking banned in large areas of the city the decision to stage an event of this scale has proved controversial in the city. </p> <p>A Chicago Tribune website poll asking whether the rally is a good idea showed the city evenly split with 52% in favour and 48% opposed.</p> <p>McCain's operatives have ridiculed Obama's event as typically ostentatious and self-aggrandising. \"I don't know if he is planning another Berlin moment, but we're having what will be a great victory night celebration with a lot of supporters,\" said campaign spokesman Brian Rogers, referring to the throngs that turned up to greet Obama in Europe in July.</p> <p>Hotels overlooking Grant Park have been booking up fast. Steve Wood and some of his neighbours booked a block of suites at the Essex Inn, which has a view of the park. He plans to watch events unfold with his partner and 9-year-old twin daughters. </p> <p>\"If my parents had taken me to JFK's victory night party when I was 9 years old,\" he told the Chicago Tribune. \"That would be something I'd remember the rest of my life.\"</p>",

That is all.</p>",
  "<p>John McCain has finally settled upon a consistent attack on Barack Obama: <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/blogs/john-farrell/2008/10/29/the-facts-about-barack-obamas-and-john-mccains-tax-plans--no-socialism-here.html\">he's a socialist</a> who will redistribute the wealth. Down in the polls, McCain probably sees no reason to hold back, but <a href=\"http://blogs.suntimes.com/sweet/2008/10/mccain_calling_obama_a_sociali.html\">such rhetoric</a> will only further poison the political discourse we desperately need to resist ideological purity in such troubling economic times. Indeed, true socialists would probably oppose a New Deal 2.0 because it is their intention to watch our capitalist system crumble, not prop it up with half measures. Historians can attest that FDR had to battle populists to the left of him at least as often as he battled opponents to the right.</p> <p>In any event, the great irony here is that McCain's portrayal of Obama to the left leading up to tomorrow's election may create a mandate for Obama to pursue <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/headlines/ci_10864851\">more redistributive economic policies</a> once elected. It will be hard for Republicans to charge that Obama did not run as a liberal when that is precisely what they have labelled him for the past several weeks.</p> <p>But what is more troubling about these latest talking points is the fact that the term \"government\" has become synonymous with \"socialist\". This may be Ronald Reagan's most enduring harm to political discourse in America, since it was he who famously observed that \"government isn't the solution, it's the problem.\" One is hard pressed to find a less useful clich\u00e9 in today's troubled world.</p> <p>Here we are on the verge of <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5ioHc80xKMiATnqCpK0cDKJzk_nPQD93QHKRG0\">nationalising our banks</a> in response to a credit crisis not seen since the Great Depression. We've bailed-out Wall Street with a $700bn package based on the recommendation of the most ideologically driven Republican president in history. McCain soon thereafter proposed a further $300bn mortgage bail-out for distressed homeowners. And now the \"tax cut and spend\" Republicans really have the nerve to claim the high ground on <em>laissez faire</em> capitalism during an economic collapse likely brought about by deregulation?</p> <p>We do indeed live in strange times, but rarely do such political contradictions appear so <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5guE0JhhcEZtoFThYoT1S3gx9bh_AD93INACO0\">glaringly obvious</a> by occurring back to back in the 24-hour news cycle. Even an electorate that practices as much cognitive dissonance as Americans no doubt <a href=\"http://elections.foxnews.com/2008/10/30/palins-alaska-shares-oil-wealth-residents/\">notices such hypocrisies</a>. Under the Republican vocabulary, one might be tempted to call George Bush and John McCain socialists. </p> <p>Most political scientists will tell you that America has long been a \"mixed economy\", which combines free-market principles with a range of entitlement programmes that come primarily from the New Deal. It's a convenient way of explaining to college freshmen a complex issue, and it is almost comforting to think we blend together the best of both worlds. But if contemplated long enough, the idea that \"big government\" is socialism, and that \"mixed economies\" are somewhere on a continuum between capitalism and socialism, leads to one inescapable conclusion: there are no truly free market countries in the world, save the anarchies.</p> <p>And, as most economists will tell you, that's not a place we want to end up. Anarchist states do very poorly economically. Thus, although our political vocabulary prefers capitalism to socialism, true <em>laissez faire</em> capitalism does not exist in any industrialised country nor can we cite any successful economy which lacks strong institutions. What's really at issue is how these strong institutions behave.</p> <p>Part of the problem in this discussion is that a <a href=\"http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/opinions/articles/2008/10/29/20081029robb29.html\">government action</a> is not and should not be confused with socialism. Socialism is a loaded term, often meaning different things to different people. To Marx, it meant some intermediary period of transition to full communism, where society would be totally egalitarian and altruistic and have no need of government. To contemporary observers who are accustomed to viewing the Soviet Union as a communist society, democratic socialism is juxtaposed to Stalinist society - a milder form of redistributive economic policies without the political repression. Think Sweden.</p> <p>But since it is so politically unacceptable to openly sympathise with socialism in America, it's difficult to engage in a dialogue on economic issues as soon as the dreaded S-word is dropped in the conversation. It's not a conversation starter, it's a conversation ender, and few Democrats even posses the historical and economic ammunition to engage in a conversation on the issue other than to simply protest the comparison.</p> <p>When people say \"socialism\" they seem to be drawing upon images of centrally planned economies - which suffer from chronic shortage and an inability to efficiently or effectively allocate resources and managerial talent. But from my vantage point, nationalising banks is not socialism, because it doesn't amount to a centrally planned economy, merely expanded institutional intervention, which was already happening.</p> <p>While drastic relative to our <em>laissez faire</em> rhetoric, on the continuum, we've simply inched closer to full intervention by upping the level of engagement. Nevertheless, the mixture is so far from pure here it's not nearly as drastic as the term socialist implies. But even if it were drastic, the redistribution of wealth in the bail-out package and nationalisation of banks seems geared toward the rich and thus doesn't fit into the \"leftist\" box we've created for it. Our conceptualisation of the issue breaks down under any serious scrutiny.</p> <p>The truth is every government action - or inaction - has an effect on the economy. Government is the guide rail through which the economy flows, determining the contours and incentives of market activity. For our entire economic history - the government has been an active participant in the markets. Whether it was our early protectionist tariffs, the transcontinental railroad or the New Deal, government has always been there, only being noticed when things go terribly wrong. But to properly conceptualise the government's role in the economy, imagine a world without government. There would be no labels on food, no institutional contract enforcement if someone bailed-out on an agreement and no police to keep the streets crime-free enough to conduct commerce with currency, which is backed by fiat of the government. </p> <p>Former Republican speaker Newt Gingrich told National Public Radio in 2005 that Americans so trust the free market that they give their credit card information to companies that transmit it across the country to some headquarters. But can one imagine such a transaction without any tort liability on the part of the corporation if it seriously harmed us in that transaction? Institutions play a major role in any economy, so much so that universities today teach \"political economy\" to deal effectively with the intersection of government and markets.</p> <p>Americans must abandon the incendiary rhetoric of the Reagan revolution, which conceives of government in a way that leaves little room for practical policies, and falsely conceptualise our economy as some sort of anarcho-capitalist society. We are not, and never have been, a free market. And by the looks of this economic crisis, we won't be one anytime soon.</p> <p>Nevertheless, it would be nice if the media would step in to discuss why McCain's support for the bail-out package wasn't socialism, but <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/opinion/content/editorial/stories/11/2/1102phillips_edit.html\">Obama's tax plan</a> is. But for the media to do that, it would first have to explain to the world just <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2008/10/31/socialism/\">exactly what socialism is</a>, and what the role of government is in the economy. That discussion is no doubt too complicated in a normal news cycle, let alone in the scrutiny of a presidential election. But if America is to survive and flourish politically and economically, it has to elevate its discourse to the level of sophistication this issue requires, or it will find itself ill equipped to address the challenges of the 21st century.</p>",
  "<p>US Senate majority leader Harry Reid said yesterday that Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska cannot remain a senator even if he's re-elected tomorrow because he's a convicted felon.</p> <p>Stevens, 84, was convicted last week in federal court on seven felony counts of failing to report gifts and services, including renovations that doubled the size of his Alaska home. Since his conviction, Stevens has continued to campaign for re-election, even as he maintains his innocence and says he \"has not been convicted of anything\". </p> <p>Stevens, who is appealing the jury verdict, has been relying on the technical definition of \"conviction\", which doesn't take effect until sentencing. His sentencing has been postponed pending his appeal.</p> <p>Stevens, who's served in the Senate since 1968, faces his most difficult re-election bid ever tomorrow against Democrat Mark Begich, the mayor of Anchorage.</p> <p>Reid's statement came in response to a press release issued on Saturday night by the Stevens campaign. In it, Stevens trumpets the claims of his longtime friend, Senator Daniel Inouye, a Democrat from Hawaii, who testified as a character witness in Stevens' corruption trial.</p> <p>Stevens, Inouye said in the press release, \"will retain his Senate seat while the legal process moves forward\".</p> <p>\"As the Senate has done in every other instance in its long 220-year history, I am absolutely confident that Ted Stevens will be sworn into the Senate while he appeals this unjust verdict,\" Inouye said. \"I am certain that this decision in Washington, DC, will be overturned on appeal.\"</p> <p>Not so, said Reid, a Nevada Democrat.</p> <p>\"While I respect the opinion of Senator Daniel Inoyue, the reality is that a convicted felon is not going to be able to serve in the United States Senate,\" Reid said. \"And as precedent shows us, Senator Stevens will face an ethics committee investigation and expulsion, regardless of his appeals process. This is not a partisan issue and it is unfortunate that Senator Stevens has used his longtime friendship with Senator Inouye for partisan political gain.\"</p> <p>Reid said that Stevens need look no further than the comments made by Stevens' fellow Republicans, including Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell from Kentucky, who said there would be \"zero tolerance\" for a convicted felon in the Senate.</p> <p>Reid also referred to statements made by the head of the committee charged with re-electing Republican senators, Senator John Ensign of Nevada. Ensign said he was \"disappointed to see his career end in disgrace\".</p> <p>If that's not enough, Reid said, consider what Republican presidential candidate John McCain, a fellow senator, said: Stevens has \"broken his trust with the people and should now step down\". </p> <p>McCain's running mate, Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, also has called on Stevens to step down.</p>",
  "<p>A Chinese negotiator began the highest-level visit to breakaway Taiwan in 60 years today, but faces protests - and egg on his face - as he discusses closer ties.</p> <p>The relationship between the mainland and Taipei has thawed since the election of the Taiwanese president, Ma Ying-jeou, in the spring. But tensions remain and thousands of police guarded the airport for the arrival of Chen Yunlin, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a>'s top negotiator on Taiwan. </p> <p>Nets and barbed wire were erected outside his hotel to prevent missiles striking him, as a pro-independence group promised NT$1,000 (\u00a319) to anyone who could hit his body with eggs and NT$10,000 to those who hit his face.</p> <p>A convoy of about two dozen taxis cruised through the streets as Chen arrived, blaring their horns and using loudspeakers to broadcast anti-China slogans. Last month, protesters in southern Taiwan pushed Chen's deputy to the ground as he visited a temple on an informal visit.</p> <p>Despite the hostile reception, the working groups today reached a tentative deal to sign agreements on direct passenger flights, cargo flights and cargo shipping tomorrow.</p> <p>Chen is the most senior Chinese official to set foot on Taiwan since the end of the civil war in 1949, when defeated Nationalists fled there. Since then the island has in effect been independent, but China still claims sovereignty and has threatened to take military action if Taipei seeks to formalise its status.</p> <p>Ma was elected in part because of his pledge to warm relations and help the island benefit from the mainland's economic boom. His poll ratings have since plunged as Taiwan's economy falters, and many voters remain nervous at the possibility of greater Chinese influence.</p> <p>\"People need to have indications that Taiwan is holding firm on its claim to sovereignty,\" said Raymond Wu, a political risk consultant in Taipei.</p> <p>The opposition Democratic Progressive party (DPP) staged a rally of around 2,000 people outside parliament tonight.</p> <p>\"If things keep on like this, Taiwan's economy will irreversibly rely fully on China,\" the DPP chairwoman, Tsai Ing-wen, warned in a letter to newspapers. \"In the not-too-distant future, would Taiwan still keep its sovereignty?\"</p>",
  "<p>A male-only shortlist for this year's John Llewellyn Rhys prize sees a narrative poem competing with The White Tiger, winner of this year's Booker prize, and three non-fiction books to take the \u00a35,000 cheque.</p> <p>Poet Adam Foulds, shortlisted for his reimagining of the Kenyan Mau Mau uprising, The Broken Word, said he was delighted to be shortlisted on what was \"clearly a very strong list\". \"It looks to me like the list has a certain kind of vigour, of originality, about all of the books on it,\" he added. \"There seems to be a particular inventive energy there that crosses genre, that to some extent is about going after the subject matter in the most vivid and direct way.\"</p> <p>He is shortlisted alongside Aravind Adiga's debut, The White Tiger, and another first novel, Ross Raisin's God's Own Country. But this year's shortlist is dominated by non-fiction, with Henry Hitchings' history of English, The Secret Life of Words, Brian Schofield's Selling Your Father's Bones, which retraces the exodus of the Nez Perce Native American tribe in 1877, and James Palmer's history of Baltic baron Roman Ungern von Sternberg, The Bloody White Baron, completing the line-up. </p> <p>The John Llewellyn Rhys prize is intended to go to the best work of literature - fiction, non-fiction, poetry or drama - by a UK or Commonwealth writer aged 35 or under. Palmer, born in 1981, is this year's youngest shortlisted author.</p> <p>Chair of judges Henry Sutton, author and books editor of the Daily Mirror, said the six titles picked by judges \"could not be stronger, or more thematically or stylistically diverse\". </p> <p>\"Each of these works are, in many ways, landmarks,\" he added. \"They stand up.\"</p> <p>\"It's a diverse shortlist, but they are all men,\" admitted last year's winner Sarah Hall, author of The Carhullan Army and on this year's panel of judges. \"We didn't notice until the final selection had been done. It seems strange but it was only when we had the six on the table that we said 'Oh God, they're all men'.\" Sutton said that judges had \"simply picked the best books\".</p> <p>With more than 80 submissions across all genres for the award, Hall said \"it was a real test\" to pit poetry against fiction, drama against non-fiction. \"It really was tough,\" she said. \"First there has to be a high quality of prose or poetry, of language and expression. Then you look at the subject matter \u2026 at what the book is setting out to do, how it succeeds in comparison to the other books.\"</p> <p>The prize was founded 65 years ago in honour of John Llewellyn Rhys, a writer who was killed in action during the second world war. Former winners include Angela Carter, Margaret Drabble, VS Naipaul and 1984's winner Andrew Motion \u2013 the last poet to have won the prize. \"There have been some very impressive prize winners over the years,\" said Hall. \"One of the things that struck me when I was looking into the history of the prize is how even-handed it was in the early years between men and women.\"</p> <p>Hall and Sutton were joined on the judging panel by author and poet Joolz Denby.</p> <p>The winner will be revealed on November 24, when he will receive a cheque for \u00a35,000. The shortlisted authors will receive \u00a3500 each.</p> <p>The shortlist in full: <br>The White Tiger by Aravind Adiga<br>The Broken Word by Adam Foulds<br>The Secret Life of Words by Henry Hitchings<br>The Bloody White Baron by James Palmer<br>God's Own Country by Ross Raisin<br>Selling Your Father's Bones by Brian Schofield</p>",
  "<p>Well, hello there! If it isn't my buddy \"Chief Editor Korir\" at <a href=\"http://africanpress.wordpress.com/\">African Press International</a>, the Norway-based African news agency that has been exciting Obama conspiracybloggers for weeks now by promising to release an incriminating set of tapes in which Michelle Obama yells at a reporter, accuses all her husband's critics of being racists, and offers good seats at Obama's inauguration in return for much-coveted favourable coverage from API. Over the last few days, the agency's unprepossessing free Wordpress.com website has been posting details of <a href=\"http://africanpress.wordpress.com/2008/11/01/the-negotiations-that-led-to-api-fox-news-network-agreement-was-initiated-by-fox/\">complex legal negotiations</a>, purportedly between it and Fox News, involving a \"Canadian lawyer\" and representatives of Fox shuttling between Oslo, New York and London. Yesterday, it claimed Fox had <a href=\"http://africanpress.wordpress.com/2008/11/02/fox-news-network-given-6-hours-ultimatum-by-api-air-the-michelle-obama-tape-or-else-face-a-legal-battle-for-breach-of-contract/\">ignored an ultimatum to broadcast the tapes</a>. The agency now <a href=\"http://africanpress.wordpress.com/2008/11/03/api-will-announce-the-final-move-monday-morning-on-the-michelle-obama-tape/\">says</a> it will \"announce the final move Monday morning\", though I think we can be fairly confident that this won't involve anything so straightforward as just publishing the tapes on its own website. A shame -- and yet I have to say that, all along, as I rode the rollercoaster of this most eyebrow-raising of election tales, I had a tiny suspicion that this was how it would end. </p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordonbrown\">Gordon Brown</a> today issued an eve-of-election plea for the winner in the US presidential poll to show leadership during the global financial crisis.</p> <p>Barack Obama or John McCain will only be president-in-waiting when world leaders including the outgoing President Bush convene in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/23/creditcrunch-globaleconomy\">Washington on November 15</a> \u2013 the winner will be sworn in as president on January 20. </p> <p>But Brown said the world would need clear American leadership in the \"coming weeks and months\" during a speech to Arab businessmen on the penultimate day of his trip to the Middle East.</p> <p>Leaders of the world's 20 most developed nations are due in Washington in 10 days' time to thrash out new rules for revamped international cooperation.</p> <p>Brown said: \"The next stage of globalisation will require even more international cooperation with American leadership central to its success. In the coming weeks and months, the whole world will want to work closely with America on a shared common agenda to bring growth and jobs back to our economies; to give greater stability to our financial system; to defeat protectionism in favour of free trade; and of course to work for a more secure world and, in the Middle East, peace.\"</p> <p>Brown is thought to have discussed his ideas for a revamped IMF on at least one of the occasions he has met the presidential candidates.<br> In a speech to Gulf businessmen in Abu Dhabi on the third leg of his Gulf tour, Brown said he feared that countries retreating to isolation and protectionism might wreck chances for a quick and sustainable recovery.</p> <p>Brown seems to have had some success in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/nov/03/gordon-brown-saudi-arabia-qatar\">enlisting Gulf support</a> for his plan to see developed nations contribute funds to an emergency bail-out fund, the details of which will emerge in Washington. </p> <p>The prime minister has proposed a five-point plan for November 15 meeting:<br>\u2022 stronger banks and more lending;<br>\u2022 the restoration of confidence in the financial system;<br>\u2022 better coordination of fiscal and monetary policy;<br>\u2022 free trade;<br>\u2022 more money for the IMF, which he has spent the past three days drumming up from the oil-rich states. </p> <p>On Sunday, Brown said he expected the Saudis would contribute funds and Qatar's prime minister, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim, has pledged support, but confirmation will not come before the November 15 meeting. Brown said if the money was forthcoming, the IMF would need to be overhauled to reflect changed international relations. </p> <p>Despite being one of Brown's closest allies in the Gulf, the Qatar prime minister appeared to ridicule the his call for a fixed oil price. \"We wish that we have a fixed price but this is a market need [to have a variable oil price],\" Jassim said at a joint press conference with the prime minister in Doha. He said he thought a fair oil price was $70-90 (\u00a344-56).</p>",

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong> Evening. Newcastle have a task on their hands to haul themselves out of the basement tonight. Villa, with the astute if not a little eccentric Martin O'Neill manning the tiller, are a heavyweight proposition in the top-flight these days. They haven't tasted defeat since Chelsea turned <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/oct/06/premierleague.chelsea\"> them over 2-0</a> at Stamford Bridge and have plundered a whopping nine goals in their last three matches. The understanding cultivated between John Carew and Gabriel Agbonlahor has been key to Villa's good form. Big Bad John has been too much for defenders to handle at times this season, and despite reportedly being slapped with a \u00a3100,000 fine for <a href=\"http://www.birminghampost.net/midlands-birmingham-sport/west-midlands-sports/2008/10/29/john-carew-tells-of-strip-club-misunderstanding-65233-22143165/\"> 'mistakenly entering'</a> Birmingham's Rocket lap-dancing bar \u2013 where customer perks include <a href=\"http://images.icnetwork.co.uk/upl/icbirmingham/jan2005/5/5/0008A500-A957-11EF-B9CB80BFB6FA0000.jpg\"> 'The Best Bouncers In Town'</a> \u2013 on the morning of a match, his form appears undiminished. Providing Carew doesn't mistakenly turn up at Villa Park tonight , he'll start alongside Gabriel Agbonlahor in attack.</p> <p>Another key striker who often finds himself surrounded by sweaty mares (at the racecourse, I might add), is little Mickey O'. He's due to make yet another return from injury for Newcastle tonight, although with Obafemi Martins beginning to look sharp up top, Joe Kinnear might start Owen on the bench or play him in a deeper lying role behind Ameobi and Martins. The former Wimbledon manager appears to have instilled some belief back into his players since arriving at St James' Park. They've certainly got a competitive midfield. Joey Barton, Nicky Butt and Danny Guthrie aren't shy of giving an opponent a good clout. And in Senegal international Habib Beye they may have found an answer to some of their comedic defending. Toon fans have already taken to singing 'Monday , Tuesday Habib Beye,' to the tune of Happy Days in his honour. Beye's response: \"Monday, Tuesday, Habib Beye, yes, I like it. I used to watch Happy Days and know all about the Fonz. <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=H2i0QWXvOn0&quot;\"> The Fonz</a> was cool but I am cool too.\" I need say no more. </p> <p><strong>An early email:</strong> \"Mr Roughley,\" says Patrick Sullivan in Washington DC rather formally. \"In the spirit in what the U.S calls exercise of democracy, which is really an attempt to gerrymander [MBM frantically checks online dictionary and finds this definition: \"To divide (a geographic area) into voting districts so as to give unfair advantage to one party in elections.\" MBMer suddenly feels smarter than he did a minute ago.] one's way into an election that is essentially determined by voting trends in four states, thereby making the opinions of others irrelevant, I am curious to see if you can predict this match's outcome through analogy of the American election. Will refreshing Barack Villa defeat aging but loyal Newcastle McCain, or will those who think they deserve victory by virtue of conviction shock the world with an upset?\" Judging by recent US election trends Patrick, I suspect a particularly close race, a few dodgy decisions and an undeserved victory for Newcastle McCain. Just call it a hunch. <br><strong>My prediction:</strong> Newcastle McCain 2-1 Barack Villa</p> <p><strong>Teams to follow</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Here's Gary Naylor...</strong> \"In your photo, isn't John Carew saying, 'I wasn't at the strip club. It's always this size.'\" I presume you're referring to the size of his talent Gary?</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>The teams are in:</strong> </p> <p><strong>Newcastle:</strong> Given, Beye, Coloccini, Taylor, Jose Enrique,<br>Gutierrez, Barton, Butt, Duff, Martins, Ameobi. <strong>Subs:</strong> Harper,<br>Guthrie, Owen, Bassong, Cacapa, N'Zogbia, Geremi.</p> <p><strong>Aston Villa:</strong> Friedel, Luke Young, Cuellar, Laursen, Shorey,<br>Milner, Reo-Coker, Barry, Ashley Young, Agbonlahor, Carew. <strong>Subs:</strong><br>Guzan, Harewood, Davies, Knight, Salifou, Sidwell, Gardner.<br><strong>Referee:</strong> Steve Bennett (Kent) </p> <p>So Michael Owen starts on the bench for Newcastle, as does Guthrie as Joe Kinnear favours the experience of Nicky Butt. For Villa, Carew and Agbonlahor start up front and former Newcastle player James Milner gets a start on the right wing. In fact looking at the Villa team my 2-1 prediction in favour of Newcastle is looking a bit ropey.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Joe Kinnear</strong> seems a little confused as he gives an interview on Setanta. He reckons a win tonight will take Newcastle into the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague/tables\">top 10 in the Premier League</a>. Sorry Joe, but it'll take Newcastle up to 14th. Perhaps the altitude when he was coaching Nepal in the 1980s had a lasting, and confusing, effect.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>A disgruntled Fantasy Football fanatic writes:</strong> \"If Martin O'Neill keeps leaving Curtis Davies out of his starting 11 we're going to have words,\" growls James Kenny. \"He has been my standout <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fantasyfootball\">Guardian Fantasy Football</a> team player and now he is suddenly getting dropped for yesterday's nearly man Cuellar!\" Well he has dropped him again James. So, those words better be stern ones; like Eh! and Oy!</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Pre-match build-up:</strong> The Blaydon Races can be heard blaring out of the PA system on a chilly looking evening in Newcastle. The teams make their way onto the pitch and we'll shortly be underway.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p>\"Dear Mr. Roughley,\" writes another formal reader, this time the ever so polite Paul Jackson in Baltimore. \"Doesn't the 'Happy Days' theme begin with \"Sunday, Monday Happy Days'? So shouldn't it have read, \"Sunday, Monday, Habib Beye\"? As a child of the TV age I couldn't help but point that out. Does this reflect poorly on the level of intelligence of Toon fans, given that they now can't even seem to get TV theme lyrics correct? I hope not. As a Yank Toon Fan I find them more loveable than the management/players for the most part.\" Perhaps they were too busy watching <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IqznlB1GhI\">Jossie's Giants</a> Paul.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> We're off! And Joey Barton immediately launches himself into a bone-crunching tackle with Reo-Coker. He wins the ball and lays down a marker.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> Villa have the better of possession in the early exchanges, with Newcastle looking a little tentative as they look to play the ball forward quickly.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Martins forces Luke Young to play a difficult pass back to Friedel. His clearance is picked up by Duff, who crosses low and hard, but Laursen clears.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> This is better from Newcastle. Martins has a pop from 25 yards but his shot is deflected for a corner. Duff knocks the corner in, but Villa have some huge players in the box and clear the aerial threat quite comfortably.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> Ashley Young clears and Carew gathers it on his chest, under no real pressure from Colocinni. He thens ambles up the right wing and buys a corner off Colocinni.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> Villa captain Gareth Barry swings the corner into the six-yard box. Given chooses to stay on his line and Laursen jumps highest and shaves the left hand post with a glancing header. Newcastle need to be strong in the air.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> Ameobi <em>is</em> strong in the air as he outjumps Laursen and flicks Given's goal kick to Martins' feet. He turns sharply inside Cuellar, who looks somewhat cumbersome, and lashes a powerful shot a couple of yards over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> Newcastle are giving Barry and Reo Coker little time on the ball in midfield. This time Butt wins back possession and works the ball back to Given. But he humps the ball forward to no-one in particular. Back to the picture: \"Perhaps in the photo John's wondering why a Norwegian is wearing gloves and a short-sleeved shirt,\" reckons Keith McIntyre. It's been positively Baltic in Britain recently Keith. I suspect you're emailing from your laptop on a deck chair in some sunny part of the States. Am I right?</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>17 min:</strong> Barton gets his buttocks in the way to prevent Agbonlahor from winning the ball. Agbonlahor throws Barton over his shoulder and somehow Villa get a free-kick in a dangerous area on the right of Newcastle's goal. Barton is given a talking-to by Steve Bennett, and as is his way in these reformed days, he puts his arm around Bennett statesman-like and walks away a better man. Villa then waste the free-kick, much to the Toon fans' pleasure.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> Apart from a few tasty tackles it's been a poor match.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> Oh hang on! A bit of decent football. Big Bad John Carew brings a long ball down with his ripped six-pack turns sharply and finds Milner on the right. He skips away from Coloccini and plays a come-and-spank-me cross to Agbonlahor, who completely misses the ball and belies his great form this season. Oh and he's in my fantasy team too.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> More action! Barry is booked for tripping Gutierrez, who goes down far too easy - the soft sod. Barton then picks up a headed clearance 30 yards out and drives a low shot off the slippery turf which Friedel does well to gather in his chunky midfriff.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> Did I say this game was poor? It's warming up nicely now. Milner turns inside his marker, and from 25 yards out, drives a shot at goal which, for a moment looks like it's about to trouble Given, but actually sails high over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> Villa fans inform the Toon faithful that their team is 'going down, going down, going down'. I presume they're singing that because they haven't got anything as original as Habib Beye's 'Happy Days' song - even if the Newcastle fans get the words wrong.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> Martins turns Laursen inside out on the right hand corner of the 18-yard box, he then shifts the ball onto his left foot 12 yards out but crashes his shot wide. If he'd have shown more composure there he could have put Newcastle ahead.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> Barton is trying to pull the strings for Newcastle, but on this occasion he pings a ball into the feet of Ameobi who can't untangle his legs and has the ball stolen off him by Cuellar.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> <strong>Great save from Shay Given! </strong>Agbonlahor beats Coloccini on the right wing and finds Ashley Young in the six yard-box. He shifts the ball onto his right foot and hammers the ball at point blank range straight into the chest of Given, who stays big ala Schmeichel, and deflects the ball over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>38 min:</strong> Ashley Young wastes the corner and Newcastle clear. A shush descends on the stadium and referee Steve Bennett can be quite clearly heard every few seconds shouting \"don't foul him\". Luke Young then does exactly this to Gutierrez and is booked for it. He can't say he wasn't warned.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>40 min:</strong> Martins looks like Newcastle's chief threat. He's the only real player in their team, perhaps barring Duff with the wind behind him, with any real pace.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>42 min:</strong> \"John Carew's ripped six-pack, Brad Friedel's chunky midriff...\" begins Tom Chivers, \"have you got a torso fetish, Mr Vaguely, or are you just concerned that you're letting yourself go a little?\" I think you're onto something Tom. Subconsciously I think I yearn for a washboard to thump a medicine ball off. Meanwhile at St James' Park. Beye ventures forward and curls a low cross invitingly towards Steven Taylor, but being a central defender, he ponders and watches the ball race past him instead of instinctively throwing a leg at the ball.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>Half-time:</strong> Well that petered out after a promising opening. Apart from Given's stunning save from Ashley Young and Friedel's stop from Barton there was very little for either keeper to do. I'm off for a half-time cuppa. Your emails to follow...</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>Half-time emails:</strong> Is Steve Bennett's instruction \"don't foul him\" allowed?\" enquires Mike Brown. \"What does the rule book say about refs giving coaching lessons during a match I wonder?\" I don't think there's any issue with it Mike. I'd imagine the FA would have a problem with it if he was jumping around shouting \"break his f***ing legs\" though. </p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p>Setanta have just shown a replay of Joey Barton flicking Agbonlahor's lips in the first half. I've got to say that boy is good. He got that one past my eagle eyes, and Steve Bennett's, expertly. It didn't seem that bad, but <em>The Rage</em> is obviously still bubbling nicely within the facade that is <em>New Barton</em>.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> We're back underway. Ashley Young goes scampering down the right wing immediately and plays a low cross towards Agbonlahor on the back post, but 'Sunday, Monday, Habib Beye' comes hurtling in front of Agbonlahor and clears for a corner.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> Barry swings the corner into the six-yard box but Newcastle clear the danger.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> Villa have started the second-half with a little more urgency than Newcastle. Although, after a tepid first-half that doesn't take much. Ashley Young clashes heads with Gutierrez and falls to the floor clutching his bonce. A lull in play.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> Ameobi backs into Laursen and somehow wins a free-kick. Jose Enrique wastes the opportunity though. Villa win a corner. But again it doesn't beat the first man.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> <em>New Barton</em> again shows that <em>The Rage</em> is bubbling beneath the surface as he stamps on the ball and Luke Young's ankles and receives a booking for his trouble. He reminds me of Michael J Fox in Teen Wolf. He's desperately trying to contain the beast within.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>53 min:</strong> Barton then releases Martins down the left. Cuellar kicks Martins into the scoreboard. The little striker throws the mother of all tantrums as he protests that Cuellar should be booked, and is deservedly booked himself for being a whining sod.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>56 min:</strong> After all that hullabaloo the free-kick is wasted. The set pieces haven't been good from either side tonight.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>Goal!!! 58 min Newcastle 1-0 Aston Villa:</strong> Barton plays a neat ball into the right hand channel for Martins, who shrugs Laursen off with a sharp turn for the second time tonight and lashes a brilliant low drive into the bottom right hand corner. He might be a whining sod, but he deserved that for his efforts tonight.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> The match has been largely poor apart from that moment of class from Martins. Barton has been Newcastle's other chief threat tonight (not just physically) so it is apt that he was instrumental in providing the assist. As for Villa, Barry has never really got the midfield working and too many long balls have been humped up towards Carew.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>63 min:</strong> Newcastle are passing the ball much better now. It's amazing what a goal can do for a team's confidence. Conor Coen writes: \"Be honest Gregg , you've been waiting a long while to work this line into your play by play...'He reminds me of Michael J Fox in Teen Wolf. He's desperately trying to contain the beast within.'\" Honestly Conor, I haven't. I was sat in a dingy flat, drunk on Halloween and happened to end up watching the film again for the first time in years. So maybe I've been waiting four days.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Duff is fouled on the edge of the penalty area. Nicky Butt pulls rank on Barton and clatters the post with a curled effort from 20 yards. Martins then slaloms past three defenders as he cuts in from the left, before Laursen nicks the ball away from him. This is good from Newcastle.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> Barton wins a corner on the left which Duff swings in. Carew, who has looked like he'd rather be in The Rocket Club so far, hooks the ball into the air and Butt, bouyed by his previous effort on goal, shows little composure and thwacks the ball into the Gallowgate End.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> As if to sum up what a bad night Carew is having, Nicky Butt - all 5ft 9in of him - outjumps the 6ft 5in Norwegian to clear a rare Villa attack.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong> 71 min:</strong> Martin Laursen gets a forearm in the face from Ameobi and is booked for his trouble. A moment later, Laursen returns the favour, but escapes a booking. If I was American I'd say: go figure!</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> Nicky Shorey is replaced by Steve Sidwell as Villa look to win the midfield battle and work the ball forward on the floor.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> Sidwell brings little finesse to proceedings though as he lunges into a tackle with the game's star performer Obafemi Martins. He is deservedly shown a yellow card.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> The match has descended into a bitty, nasty spectacle, which will suit Newcastle as they look to hold onto their lead.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> Ameobi receives a long ball in the right hand corner and holds the ball up with aplomb. He wastes a few seconds with some rubber-legged stepovers and holds off a few defenders before... wasting possession.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>Goal!!! Newcastle 2-0 Aston Villa, Martins 82 min:</strong> Gutierrez and Duff exchange passes on the left wing. Gutierrez draws his defender in towards him and then races to the by-line. He cuts the ball back inside and finds Martins a yard from goal, who simply taps the ball into the empty net. Well deserved on the balance of play.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> A concerned Villa fan called Nathan, currently residing in Amsterdam, writes: \"Bugger me! Just when it's the time for the Villa to grasp the moment, assert our credentials as the real deal \u2013 now that Arsenal are slipping \u2013 we appear to be bottling it. I wish I had something witty or incisive to say. But I don't. That's the truth of it. It's just painful. Mind you, at least we don't have that thug Barton playing for us...\" No Nathan, if you had Barton on your team tonight you might have scored a goal. Perish the thought...</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> Man of the match Obafemi Martins is substituted to a huge round of applause. Cacapa replaces him.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> Newcastle fans 'ole' every pass now as Villa look consigned to defeat. I suppose they should be allowed their small moments of pleasure, they've had precious little else to enjoy so far this season.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>89 min:</strong> Beye stings Friedel's palms with an angled drive from 12 yards. Villa break and win a corner which is cleared to Sidwell; but his strike goes yards over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>90+1 min:</strong> Shola Ameobi, who has worked his long socks off, is replaced by a grinning Michael Owen. His first touch is a pass to Duff who works the ball back to the Newcastle defence. Given receives the ball and clears long to Gutierrez.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>Full-time:</strong> Duff jinks through the Villa midfield and referee Steve Bennett blows his whistle really loud to bring an end to play.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>Full-time musings:</strong> What a strange weekend (and no, not the Teen-Wolf party). All four of the Premier League's bottom clubs won. Villa showed very little of the attacking prowess that has made them an exciting team to watch this season, but Newcastle clearly wanted it more. Joe Kinnear doesn't appear to have altered Newcastle's tactics any great deal, but he has instilled steel into the Magpies defence and midfield, which is making them difficult to break down in open play. Barton's return hasn't been heralded by many, but his nous, together with his competitive spirit, has clearly helped the Magpies. The problem for Kinnear - and a nice problem this is too - is how to fit Michael Owen into the frontline with Ameobi and Martins. Perhaps poor Mickey O' is going to find himself left out by England and Newcastle too. Thanks for all your emails.</p>",
  "<p>The polls in Seattle, Washington, are closed and a Diebold AccuVote electronic voting machine is chattering its way through the results. Votes cast using its touchscreen ballot have been captured on an encrypted memory card and duplicated on a continuous printed paper roll.</p> <p>So has the city chosen Senator McCain (Republican) or Senator Obama (Democrat) for president? Neither, as it happens. The only votes recorded on this AccuVote for the highest office in the land are for one Mark Harris (Independent).</p> <p>Fortunately for America, this is only my test run of voting technology that will be used for real by around a third of US voters tomorrow. But before Americans rejoice at their narrow escape from four years' rule by a technology writer, they might want to listen to Dan Wallach, associate professor of computer science at Rice University in Texas.</p> <p>Last year, <a href=\"http://www.cs.rice.edu/~dwallach/pub/texas-house-elections25june08.pdf\">Wallach conducted an in-depth review of the Diebold AccuVote for Californian election officials</a> (PDF) and discovered its software was littered with vulnerabilities.</p> <p>\"We found all kinds of problems,\" he says, \"Our study showed that you only need to apply an evil software patch \u2014 forcing the machine to swap votes between candidates \u2014 to a single machine, and you can arrange for that patch to spread to every machine in the system. It takes a relatively modest effort to corrupt every voting machine in the county.\"<br> The study found similar vulnerabilities with voting machines from two other manufacturers, leading California's secretary of state to <a href=\"http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voting_systems/ttbr/diebold.pdf\">withdraw her approval for all three devices</a> (PDF).</p> <p>Nevertheless, these machines will be used by millions of voters across the country on election day. \"There are no nationwide legal requirements for electronic voting machines. They vary from state to state and even from county to county,\" explains Professor Edward Felten, director of the center for information technology policy at Princeton University. \"Even for states that follow federal guidelines, its testing and certification processes have lots of problems.\"</p> <p>These problems are starting to be revealed by early voting in some states. Voters in West Virginia, Texas and Tennessee have reported electronic \"vote flipping\", where their touchscreen selections flip unexpectedly to rival candidates. It seems particularly prevalent where 'straight ticket' selection of the entire ballot along party lines is allowed. (A <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aBaX9GPSaQ\">video by the makers of the Simpsons about such flipping</a> has gone viral.)</p> <p>This is probably not an organised attempt to defraud voters, according to Wallach: \"If the machines were maliciously flipping candidates, you wouldn't be seeing it on screen, it would be happening silently behind the display. It's most likely poor programming, user confusion and calibration errors.\"</p> <p>When mass voting starts, more such bugs are bound to emerge. During the presidential primary elections earlier this year, thousands of votes were erroneously switched or lost entirely when software and hardware errors affected machines from South Carolina and Florida to Ohio and even Washington DC.</p> <p>Ironically, electronic voting was originally adopted in an effort to reform problems with archaic punch-card and lever machines. These were responsible for the <a href=\"http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~jones/cards/chad.html\">infamous \"hanging chads\"</a> that helped swing the close-run presidential elections in 2000 in favour of George Bush.</p> <p>In 2002, the House and Senate passed the Help America Vote Act, which gave states $3.8bn (\u00a32.4bn) to modernise voting technology and improve access for the disabled. Individual states chose different technologies, some of which have proved more secure and reliable than others.</p> <p>\"There seems to be an inherent problem with any system that keeps only electronic records,\" says Professor Felten. \"It makes it very difficult for election officials and voters to verify their votes.\" Twelve states currently use paperless electronic voting machines, and 16 more have been judged by the non-partisan Brennan Center for Justice to offer \"inadequate\" post-election manual audits.</p> <p>Both Felten and Wallach are calling for voting machine manufacturers to make their software open source, as is already the case in Australia's Capital Territory. \"Revealing source code should be mandatory,\" says Wallach. \"It's really important for transparency and it doesn't reduce security.\"</p> <p>Wallach is also working on a next-generation voting machine called VoteBox that uses sophisticated cryptographic techniques to allow voters to challenge whether machines are recording their votes correctly.</p> <p>\"The technology to build a fundamentally better machine is available today,\" he says. \"But it's unclear whether there is the money to develop it. The Help America Vote Act gave a one-time deluge of cash to upgrade systems. When the money runs out, we're heading back to paper.\"</p> <p>Wallach's predictions appear to be coming true. Alaska, California, Florida, Iowa, Maryland, Tennessee and New Mexico are ditching electronic voting machines and this election will see a decrease in their numbers nationwide for the first time.</p> <p>The only technology growing in popularity is optical scan voting, which combines a simple paper ballot with uncomplicated computer scanners. Almost 100 million American voters will vote via optical scanning tomorrow \u2014 around 50 million more than by touchscreen.</p> <p>Washington state is going one step further. When my Diebold AccuVote is packed up at 8pm on November 4, its memory card and paper roll carefully dispatched to the voting depot, Seattle's polling stations will close their doors for the last time \u2014 because Washington state is moving to a vote-by-mail system for all future elections.</p> <p>It's a sure solution for electronic voting fraud. But now I can't help wondering: exactly how secure is my postman?</p>",

  "<p>When discussing the Senate races in the United States this year, one question looms large on the mind of any political analyst or junkie. Namely, will the Democrats or won't they? Get to 60 votes, that is.</p> <p>The figure 60 is \u2013 outside of gaining a simple majority (of 51 votes) \u2013 the second-most important number to shoot for in the Senate. This is because a procedure known as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filibuster\">filibuster</a>, in the past used when the minority found legislation so offensive that they were willing to get up and talk, talk and talk some more, is now employed by Republican minority leader and legislation constipator Mitch McConnell more often than Sarah Palin can say \"You betcha!\". To stop this verbal assault requires a \"supermajority\" or 60 votes. Hence, it is a magic number of sorts.</p> <p>When this election season began, prognosticators of all stripes believed that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">economic malaise</a>, an unpopular war in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq\">Iraq</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/georgebush\">Republican president</a> in the White House with an approval rating on par with scurvy, made Democratic pickups the most likely outcome. When five Republican senators decided to retire and Democrats raised a lot more money than their Republican counterparts, Democratic chances were only enhanced. And every day brings seemingly worse news for the GOP.</p> <p>Currently, short of a damaging event on the level of a natural disaster \u2013 or a public endorsement by Madonna \u2013 Democrats are poised to gain at least six seats. Right now, in Virginia, New Mexico, Colorado, New Hampshire, Alaska and Oregon the die has been cast. As Democrats effectively now have 51 seats in the senate (by including the two independents who caucus with the Democrats \u2013 Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Bernie Sanders of Vermont), that would mean they need three more to get to 60. Currently, comedian Al Franken is slightly ahead of Republican incumbent and used-car salesman impersonator Norm Coleman in Minnesota, and the Democrats are also in position to beat former Republican cabinet member and wife of 1996 GOP presidential candidate Bob Dole, North Carolina Senator Liddy Dole. That gets you to 59.</p> <p>Yet, in three more races in the South \u2013 Mississippi, Georgia and Kentucky (McConnell's seat) \u2013 the polls show a dead heat. Meanwhile in Maine, Democrat Tom Allen is gaining on election-year moderate Susan Collins. In the Georgia race, as a special bonus, if nobody gets 50% (quite likely with a Libertarian candidate also running), then a runoff will be set for a month later, or the beginning of December.</p> <p>So if you think all the drama might be done election night, just imagine one more month of fun, especially if the Democrats are standing at 59 seats on November 5. This would prove my theory, which is that American electioneering never does in fact end. </p> <p>In any case, November 4 should be a very good night for the Democrats. And Republicans? Well, they may find themselves looking up the definition of <a href=\"http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Hari-kiri\">hari-kiri</a>.</p>",
  "<p>So what've we learnt from this year's election? That nationalising a nation's banking system isn't socialist, but raising taxes on high earners is? That it's quite easy to get through <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/03/sarah-palin-phine-prank-sarkozy\">to Sarah Palin's cell</a>? Or - most importantly - that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barry Obama's</a> oratory skills make for kick-ass samples? </p> <p>It seems that Obama can lend both gravitas and social capital to men and women whose previous hits have included songs called things like My Humps. And so, as the election crawls its way to its conclusion like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTn1v5TGK_w\">a fading iron woman competitor</a>, here are our top <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music\">songs</a> featuring Obama sampling. Obampling, if you will.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjXyqcx-mYY\">Yes We Can</a></strong> </p> <p><strong>Artists: </strong>Will.I.Am, Common, Scarlett Johansson, John Legend and, er, NBA legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</p> <p><strong>Speech sampled: </strong>Obama's post-New Hampshire primary speech.</p> <p><strong>Point in campaign released: </strong>Er, just as Hillary Clinton brought the Obama campaign back down to earth with victory in the first (non-caucus) primary. Yes we can! Er, probably.</p> <p><strong>USP: </strong>The Rock Around the Clock to Nas's Love Me Do, Yes We Can is less a song than an Obama speech with people rudely singing over the top. Quite poignant now, but will look spectacularly dumb if Obama loses. </p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK39MpPsF2o&amp;feature=related\">Black President</a></strong> </p> <p><strong>Artist: </strong>Nas<br><strong><br>Speech sampled: </strong>Obama's victory speech at the Iowa caucus - a misleading start to a primary season so elongated that it made Return of the King look like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnT7nYbCSvM\">the final scene of the Sopranos</a>.</p> <p><strong>Point in campaign released: </strong>The day after Obama sealed the Democratic nomination in June.</p> <p><strong>USP: </strong>Nas's untitled 9th album is relentlessly pessimistic, so this little ditty proved a nice counterpoint. It's also by far the best of all the Obamples. Also, there's a sample of Tupac's voice in there too. Shakur 2016!</p> <p><strong>Yes We Can</strong> </p> <p><strong>Artist: </strong>Boy George</p> <p><strong>Speech sampled: </strong>Obama's This Time Must Be Different speech on Super Tuesday.<br><strong><br>Point in campaign released: </strong>About the point where undecided Americans might need the influence of meddling foreign pop stars sampling Obama to help them decide to vote for John McCain.<br><strong><br>USP: </strong>Its utter lunacy. Not only has ol' George named his song after Will.I.Am and gang's zeitgeisty hit, he's also turned Obama's message of transformative government into a crap disco ditty that's more Vengaboys than Culture Club. Also, who's going to swallow a message of change from a man best recently remembered for sweeping New York City pavements?<br><strong><br>Also noted: </strong>The terrible animated David Bowies playing guitar at the beginning of the video.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKsoXHYICqU\">I Got A Crush on \u2026 Obama</a></strong><br><strong><br>Artist: </strong>Obama Girl<br><strong><br>Speech sampled: </strong>One of Obama's early speeches thanking people for their initial support having seen his primary campaign get off the ground.<br><strong><br>Point in campaign released: </strong>Summer 2007. The point when Hillary Clinton's campaign looked formidable. Did anyone say \"tipping point\"?<br><strong><br>USP: </strong>Wildly inappropriate comedy sex ballad about the married father of two. Obama Girl's story of falling in love with the would-be president was nicely juxtaposed with Obama's gracious words. Top lyric? \"So I put down my Kerry sign/Knew I had to make you mine/You're so sexy, so fine.\" Barack himself reported that his daughters were unimpressed by the whole thing. One can imagine Michelle's reaction. William H Taft never had to deal with this kind of thing. </p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=3iojPaw8yX0\">Vote for Hope</a></strong> </p> <p><strong>Artist: </strong>MC Yogi</p> <p><strong>Speech sampled: </strong>Obama's convention speech from Denver's Invesco Field.</p> <p><strong>Point in campaign released: </strong>October 2008, just as John McCain's campaign exploded. It's more get out the vote than the others' get out the hope.</p> <p><strong>USP: </strong>Set to a video that combines Shepherd Fairey's already iconic portrait of Barack Obama, mixed with some fancy De La Soul-like rhymes from Californian yoga enthusiast/Obama supporter Nicholas Giacomini. Hang on \u2026 Yoga, Californian, Democrat? Stinking elitist. <br> <strong>Other Obamples:<br></strong> <br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmymXAxTjrc\">Docta Musica Wahi Wara \u2013 Barack Obama <br></a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\" _3ex_ola3fs\" \"><br>Fojeba \u2013 Fired Up and Ready to Go </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw4fRvFhuh4&amp;feature=\" related\" \">Alan Ross Fleishman \u2013 Something About the Man <br></a> <br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\" ok1lz_eilsa\" \">Bentley Kalaway \u2013 We Are the Ones <br></a> <br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\" vywatu54da8\" \">Rick E Lewis \u2013 What Change Looks Like <br></a> <br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\" guevsg8zz6g\" \">Shanice Wilson \u2013 President We Need <br></a> <br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu7GBt-8hs\">Manish Shah \u2013 I Wanna Be Obama <br></a></p>",
  "<p>Anti-Americanism doesn't just manifest itself at the dining tables of fashionable London or at routine flag-burning displays in the Middle East. It has serious practical consequences too. Hostile public opinion in Turkey prevented American troops from invading Iraq from the north, seriously complicating the whole war. In Poland and the Czech Republic it has delayed cooperation with Washington on missile defence. Many American businesses and tourists will also testify to the problem. But are we getting the full story from Pew and the other pollsters that aim to teach us about the world's view of the United States? New opinion polling, conducted for <a href=\"http://americaintheworld.typepad.com/\">AmericaInTheWorld</a>, questions three components of the conventional wisdom on anti-Americanism.</p> <p>First of all we found that British citizens may make anti-American noises in the abstract but they still look to America when the chips are down. We are all too familar with <a href=\"http://pewglobal.org/americaagainsttheworld/\">those surveys</a> that find that many Europeans regard America as a greater threat to world peace than Iran. Our demographically balanced survey of nearly 2,000 British citizens tried to probe more deeply. We asked respondents to imagine that they had been taken prisoner by terrorists and that they had to be rescued by troops from a foreign nation. More than half (53%) said that they would most want to be rescued by the American military. Less than 1% preferred their liberators to be Iranian soldiers. Nearly five times as many Britons wanted the Stars and Stripes to be on their rescuers' uniform than wanted to see the flags of Germany or France. America scored almost as highly when we asked British people to choose a nation that they would like to work or holiday in.</p> <p>The second misconception concerns <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a>. The likely election of Barack Obama as America's next president will have an electric effect on global opinion but it will not cure every form of anti-Americanism. We found that his current popularity might struggle to survive the real challenges of presidential office. To a large extent we found that he is damned whatever course of action he chooses. For example, 51% of Britons would think less of him if he approved a military strike against Iran but 52% would also rate him less favourably if he failed to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. The course of action most likely to erode his support within Britain would be protectionist measures that stopped UK businesses from enjoying free access to US markets. Seventy per cent of British citizens would feel less warmly about him should he pursue such protectionism. A President Obama offers no inoculation against the unpopular responsibilities that burden the world's superpower.</p> <p>The third piece of conventional wisdom treats anti-Americanism as a rational phenomenon. Anti-Americanism is often understood to be a response to the mishandling of the Iraq war or of Washington's failure to ratify the Kyoto treaty on global warming. These factors certainly explain much of the rise in anti-Americanism documented by Pew but they don't tell the full story. Our survey found that much anti-Americanism is based in ignorance. We asked our panel of British voters to say whether certain factual statements about America were true or false. We found that Britons were consistently prone to inaccurately think the worst of America. They wrongly believed that America had sold Saddam Hussein a large share of his weaponry. In reality China, Russia and France had armed the former Iraq dictator.</p> <p>They wrongly believed the US was performing worse than Europe on CO2 emissions. Many also believed that emergency medical treatment was unavailable to America's poor and that polygamy was protected by US courts. These misconceptions exist in a nation widely regarded as America's best friend. The ignorance and associated negativity may be much worse in nations with less historical and cultural empathy.</p> <p>Anti-Americanism is not going to disappear when President Bush leaves the White House or when the Iraq war fades in the memory. It is a more complex phenomenon than most analyses suggest. The world's top power has always been resented. Perspectives are often contradictory. Some hate America for its religious conservatism. Others hate America's social liberalism and the violent output of Hollywood. Some protest against America for intervening in the world. Some for washing its hands of global responsibilities. I do not argue that America should ignore world opinion but it should not believe that world opinion is as simple as some opinion polls suggest.</p>",
  "<p>Here's <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=a98690e8-d6b0-44fa-a3f0-c76414c3c9da\">a really important story</a> from Sahil Mahtani in The New Republic on the question of whether John McCain illegally leaked negative information about some fellow senators back during the Keating Five investigation.</p> <p>I know, the election seems close to a done deal, what's the need for more dirt on McCain, etc. But please believe me. Election entirely aside, <em>you need to click through the above link and read this</em>. It will tell you quite a lot about the man. Bottom line? In all likelihood, he should have been kicked out of the Senate back in 1991.</p> <p>The short version is this: The Senate Ethics Committee was probing the Keating matter. Suddenly, stories from anonymous sources started appearing in some newspapers. Interestingly, these stories all tended to exonerate McCain and suggest greater culpability on the part of the four other senators.</p> <p>Suspicions arose. The Senate ordered a probe into the leaks \u2013 leaks about senators whose careers are possibly on the line are something other senators tend to take very seriously. McCain swore, under oath, that he was not the source of the leaks. Lying under oath, of course, is a crime: perjury.</p> <p>No smoking gun was ever found, so McCain was able to scoot away. But the chief investigator of the internal probe \u2013 as well as others who were familiar with the situation \u2013 believe to this day that McCain was the leaker:</p> <blockquote> <p>Finally, there are Hall's reflections on the leaks today: \"When you look at these stories, you interview the people--I must have interviewed 50-60 people, and I didn't have one single person defend McCain. If and when they pointed, they pointed in his direction.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Remember, McCain was in his first term. He was by several accounts panicked that his career was about to end. Already then, he wanted to be president. That he would have done whatever he needed to do to save his skin is not farfetched. </p> <p>An ironic note as well, which tells us something about Washington and our media culture. This was also around the time that McCain held his famous \"mea culpa\" press conference, in which he seemingly exhaustively answered all media questions about the Keating matter. The \"golly gee, John McCain is so open and accessible to the press\" narrative got its start there. </p> <p>At the same time he was being open and accessible and playing the violin of contrition and self-abasement in front of some gullible reporters, however, he was also in all likelihood spoon-feeding other reporters negative information about four of his colleagues so as to save his own ass. Now that's character, no? I hope he still has nightmares about Dennis DeConcini.</p> <p>Mahtani \u2013 Bravo! Let us be rid of this man once and for all, please.<br></p>",
  "<p>Last week I was in an audience watching on when a Nobel prize-winning physicist was asked what he was currently working on. He just said, with genuine modesty, \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_everything\">The Theory of Everything</a>\". I won't even pretend to know the ins and outs of this particular subject \u2013 I can't even find a button for it on my scientific calculator \u2013 but it seems from what he said was that until we fully understand gravity we will continue to struggle to unify all the various branches of physics. But when we do \u2026 oh boy, just wait.</p> <p>I've been thinking about this missing jigsaw piece ever since. (Nope, I still haven't cracked it.) But it has also got me thinking about some of the other known unknowns that surround us. Flick through the news channels this week and one really stands out \u2013 that elusive, little-understood universal force we call \"confidence\".</p> <p>We've lost confidence in the banks. Consumer confidence is down. Thousands of people say they have lost confidence in the BBC following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/30/jonathan-ross-russell-brand\">Sachsgate</a>. There's a major lack of confidence among house buyers.<br>Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/oct/30/tottenhamhotspur-premierleague1\">Harry Redknapp</a> has instantly instilled confidence into the players at Tottenham Hotspur just days after the soon-to-be-sacked Juande Ramos received the dreaded \"vote of confidence\". <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/23/uselections2008-barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> is worried he might be looking too confident. John McCain is confident he knows how to <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=LnMSaxLzD1o\">catch Osama Bin Laden</a> if elected president.</p> <p>A huge part of the media we now consume, it seems, is about improving self-confidence. Self-help books tell us how we can improve our love lives, or get the perfect job. Programmes hosted by the likes of <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/life/microsites/H/htlgn/gok.html\">Gok Wan</a> and <a href=\"http://www.trinnyandsusannah.com/\">Trinny and Susannah</a> show us how we can \"feel confident about our bodies\", or \"dress with confidence\". <a href=\"http://www.paulmckenna.com/\">Paul McKenna</a>, the self-proclaimed \"world's leading hypnotist\", has sold millions of books around the world with his promise of \"instant confidence\".</p> <p>It is quite clear than we crave confidence. But it's a difficult balance: too little, and we wither; too much, and we can go the way of investment bankers down the slippery slope of hubris and arrogance. Many of us would pay handsomely to be pumped full of confidence. Scientists said earlier this year that they were on the verge of creating a commercially viable <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/2175030/Shyness-drug-could-boost-confidence.html\">drug that could boast confidence</a> and cure \"shyness and social awkwardness\". (I guess they hadn't come across alcohol or cocaine?)</p> <p>But given its importance across so many areas of our lives \u2013 socially, politically and economically \u2013 it seems strange that there appears to have been remarkably little serious study into the science of confidence. We're wading knee-deep in self-help quackery about improving our \"inner confidence\", but there's next to no scholarly, empirical input into this subject.</p> <p>Confidence is essentially faith. Faith in yourself. Faith in your team mates. Faith in the market. Faith in your leaders. Dare I say it, faith in a deity of some kind or other. But what are the triggers? As with gravity, it seems, we urgently need to truly understand the causality.</p> <p>However, I do slightly fear the consequences of us unlocking the secret to confidence. Just imagine living in a society where everyone is equally confident. I can't quite work out if it would lead to an anodyne, homogenised world of oppressive sameness. Or whether it would lead to some kind of modern-day Third Reich dangerously drunk on self-confidence. Perhaps ignorance is bliss, after all?</p>",
  "<h2>Last minute dash</h2> <p>The final, nerve-jangling weekend of the election campaign offered several unpleasant moments for Barack Obama and his supporters, above all the revelation that his Kenyan paternal aunt, Zeituni Onyango, was living in Boston in contravention of a deportation order. (Immigration is an issue that could theoretically draw votes away from Obama, though John McCain is far from a hardline anti-immigration voter's dream candidate.) </p> <p>Then there was the ad, paid for by Pennsylvania Republicans, that broke McCain's promise not to make an issue of Obama's pastor, Jeremiah Wright, who was shown thundering \"God damn America!\" There were robocalls quoting Hillary Clinton calling Obama inexperienced, and also a tape of a newspaper interview which, Republicans argued, showed Obama was willing to bankrupt the US coal industry.</p> <p>But none of it seemed to stick. There was a little time remaining, of course, for these last Republican attacks to weigh against Obama. But by the end of the weekend there was no sign that they had done. The RealClearPolitics average put him on 50% to John McCain's 43% - a lead that, if replicated in tomorrow's election, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/03/barack-obama-us-elections-polls\">would produce a landslide victory</a>, Suzanne Goldenberg and Ewen Macaskill write in the Guardian today.</p> <p>Both candidates hared across the country, Obama stressing the importance of actually voting and McCain claiming that he could sense that \"the momentum is there\" for him to win. \"What we are in for is a slam-bang finish,\" predicted McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, while McCain's former rival, Fred Thompson, told NBC: \"John's a closer. He always has been. He often is given up for dead - literally and politically. People have been wrong about him before.\" But as Obama appeared alongside Bruce Springsteen in Cleveland last night, permitting himself some optimistic words before a crowd of 80,000, the momentum seemed to be heading in one direction only.</p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>In last-minute campaigning overdrive, McCain visits Florida, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Mexico and Nevada today, finishing with an event in Arizona. Obama is in Florida and North Carolina, and concludes his campaign with a rally in Manassas, Virginia. Both candidates will be interviewed during the halftime break on Monday Night Football. And thus the campaign draws to a close.</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>Obama ended the weekend with commanding leads in national polls: 52%-43% in Gallup's likely voter tracking poll, 51%-46% for Rasmussen's and 54%-43% in ABC News's - as good as his best performance to date in that poll. A CNN poll has Obama 53% to McCain's 46%, a USA Today survey (also done by Gallup) puts the candidates at 53%-42%. The scale of the challenge for McCain, in a nutshell: by the Washington Post' reckoning, he'd have to win all the states that are solidly Republican, all the states that are leaning Republican, all the states that are a toss-up - and still find an additional 23 electoral college votes in order to win. Mason-Dixon polls over the weekend put Obama well ahead in Colorado, Virginia, Nevada and North Carolina, and with a narrow lead in Florida, with McCain two points ahead in Ohio and Missouri. And the final poll from the Pew Research Centre doesn't just put Obama in the lead: it goes so far as to predict that he will actually win by six points, 52% to 46%.</p> <h2>On theguardian.com now</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/03/george-bush-legacy-dubya\">Simon Schama: Nowhere man: a farewell to Dubya</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/03/us-election-republicans-democrats-tomasky\">Michael Tomasky: Liberal paranoiacs, breathe easy</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/03/us-elections-international-opinion\">The world holds its breath as America decides</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/nov/03/uselections-2008-american-muslims\">Road trip, one day to go: America's outcast Muslims</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/audio/2008/nov/03/us-president-election-last-day-campaign\">Audio: Suzanne Goldenberg on the closing stages of the campaign</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/world/video/2008/nov/03/uselections20081\">Video: Gary Younge visits his mother-in-law</a></p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2203420/\">Slate: An Obama loss would be a disaster</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/03/opinion/03krugman.html?ref=opinion\">Paul Krugman, New York Times: Defeat will leave a Republican rump</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1108/15194.html\">Politico: Superstition and strategy in Obamaland</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/02/AR2008110201737.html?hpid=topnews\">Washington Post: Ohio, the state both candidates covet</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alec-baldwin/voting-for-truth_b_140304.html&quot;\">Huffington Post: Voting for truth</a></p> <h2>Quotes of the weekend</h2> <p>\"You start thinking maybe we might be able to win an election on November 4\": Barack Obama, appearing alongside Bruce Springsteen at a Cleveland rally that drew an estimated 80,000 people, many of whom were reportedly in tears</p> <p>\"I don't know about you, but I want my country back, I want my dream back, I want my America back\": The Boss speaks</p> <p>\"Yesterday, Dick Cheney came out of his undisclosed location.

In Pittsburgh, a city with a large Muslim population, the Guardian team heard sentiments like these when we attended a lecture by the writer and political analyst Raeed Tayeh titled Are Americans Obsessed with Islam?, followed by a panel discussion involving local community leaders and advocates.</p> <p>One of the few <a href=\"http://www.cair.com/Portals/0/pdf/American_Muslim_Voter_Survey_2006.pdf \">comprehensive surveys (pdf)</a> of Muslim voters in the United States was produced two years ago by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). While they are a diverse community, American Muslims overall tend to be young, well educated, professional, middle-class, and family-oriented, and differ in their degree of religious observance. Muslims are also somewhat more likely than Americans in general to vote regularly, fly the US flag and do volunteer work.</p> <p>Most importantly for this election, CAIR's demographic research found that American Muslims were concentrated in 12 states, including the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Florida, Virginia, and Michigan, where they ran from about 3 to 7% of the population. In the survey, 42% of respondents said they were Democrats and just 17% identified themselves as Republicans, while 28% said they did not belong to a political party. This reflects a dramatic turnaround in the past decade: in 2000, George Bush won an astonishing <a href=\"http://www.washington-report.org/archives/Jan_Feb_2001/0101026.html\">72% of the Muslim vote</a>, based on some combination of his social and fiscal conservatism, perceived openness on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and deliberate outreach to the Muslim community. By 2004, with the \"war on terror\" and the war in Iraq under way and civil liberties in a shambles, the numbers were more than reversed, with some 90% of Muslim voters choosing Kerry.</p> <p>This year, it appears that Barack Obama can count on a <a href=\"http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=40825\">substantial majority</a> of Muslim votes. To begin with, many Muslims in the United States are African American. Those who trace their roots to the Middle East, Asia, and elsewhere like Obama's record of opposition to the Iraq war and believe he can be better trusted on civil liberties and immigration issues. While some will vote for him enthusiastically, others will do so despite feeling alienated and betrayed by what they see as Obama's eagerness to escape being \"branded\" a Muslim (which 12% of Americans apparently still believe he is).</p> <p>The accusations have been both vicious and absurd: emails and robocalls have declared that Obama attended a fundamentalist madrassah, that he will take the oath of office on the Qur'an, that he is a Manchurian candidate for a worldwide terrorist jihad. In his responses, Obama has often failed to denounce the underlying racism inherent in these attacks, and has done little to dispel the overarching sense that <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95985609\">Islam itself is a stigma</a> from which he must distance himself. \"I'm not and never have been of the Muslim faith,\" he <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/naomi-klein/obama-being-called-a-mus_b_89228.html \">said in one interview</a>, as if he were answering to some sort of unChristian activities committee.</p> <p>Imam Mahdi Bray expressed this feeling of betrayal at the Pittsburgh forum. \"No Muslim wants to be sacrificed at the alter of political expediency. I think Barack Obama has practiced that. I think that for his own candidacy that Obama has kind of thrown us under the bus.\"</p> <p>On the other side, however, is John McCain, whose campaign, <a href=\"http://www.contracostatimes.com/columns/ci_10611058\">as one <br>Muslim writer put it</a>, has from the start \"conflated the terms 'Islamic' with 'terrorism' and 'radical extremism'.\" He points to the DVD distributed to tens of thousands of voters in swing states, called \"Obsession: Radical Islam's War on the West,\" with scenes of Muslims \"flying planes into buildings, bombing people, burning American flags and screaming with homicidal rage. Although the video dutifully offered a disclaimer that most Muslims are not fanatics, its horrific images and sinister music conveyed an emotional message about Muslims that was unmistakable.\"</p>",
  "<p>Campaigning for Barack Obama in the still warm and sunny battle-ground of Virginia, what lessons are there for British politics in this historic election?</p> <p>1) First, find your Tony Blair. Watching Obama give a long <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/30/rachel-maddow-interviews_n_139402.html\">interview to Rachel Maddow</a>, a woman who the BBC could hire tomorrow to show how political talk shows can be interesting and fun, I was struck by his uncanny resemblance to Blair. It was time to get past tit-for-tat politics, said Obama. Capitalism was OK. The Republican party had many fine people in it, the Democratic candidate declared. Obama is as devout a Christian as he is devoted family man. Welcome to Barack Blair!</p> <p>2) Speak well. The old rules of rhetoric never go away. Obama is a terrific public orator. Every time he stands at a podium, still, slim and in control of his body as he speaks without notes in short, effective sentences he exudes command and control. By contrast, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/01/davidcameron.toryconference1\">David Cameron's conference speech</a> this year was as interesting as John McCain's Tory conference speech in 2007.</p> <p>3) If you are a Conservative, be one. McCain is tarred with being the continuation of Bush-Cheney years by other means. In fact, he opposed much of the Bush ideology over the years. His latest TV advert shows Obama praising McCain for initiating environmental legislation in the Senate. This makes Obama look good but dismays American rightwing voters who don't like to see their man hugging the enemy close.</p> <p>4) Gear up for door-to-door canvassing. Spending time with Democrats gives the lie to the view that American elections are all about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/30/uselections2008-barackobama-4m-30-minute-infomercial\">big money and TV campaigning</a>. They are but the intensity of phone canvassing and door knocking is greater than I have ever seen in the UK outside byelections. Canvassers have handheld personal data machines that allow instant transfers of voters' intentions and interests. As I write friends are taking leave from work to drive hours to North Carolina to get out the vote in a state where Obama and McCain are neck and neck.</p> <p>5) Hit greed but love business. Obama lashes Wall Street but talks up Main Street. Small businesses are the new working unrich in America. The Tories chez nous are now the party of the super-wealthy as the millionaires' frontbench presided over by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/27/osborne-tories-deripaska-mandelson\">Oligarch Osborne</a> and super-rich Cameron demonstrate. But Labour can come dangerously close to being anti-business especially in the rhetoric from those looking to a post-election leadership fight.</p> <p>6) Be tough on international issues. Obama wants to <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jnI2PmONXtYeD7lMyxUPK4Y5gEGg\">increase troop commitments</a> in Afghanistan and has taken India to task over <a href=\"http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/News/PoliticsNation/Obamas_remark_on_solving_Kashmir_dispute_welcome/articleshow/3664967.cms\">Kashmir</a> where nearly a million Indian and Pakistani soldiers face off against each other, instead of the latter being transferred to Pakistan's western borders to help uproot Islamist jihadists seeking to reconquer Afghanistan to close down every girls' school. His vice-presidential running mate, Joe Biden, is friend and supporter of Georgia's Mikheil Saakashvili in contrast to Tory footsying around with Russian money or Tories on the Council of Europe collaborating with Kremlin puppets. Obama wants to work with Europe as a whole, not deal one by one with EU member states rejecting European unity as in the Hague-Cameron vision of Europe. His promise of an undivided Jerusalem as the eternal capital of Israel is a further example of a foreign affairs approach that his mixed-message language on Iraq should not occult.</p> <p>7) Don't invite losers to speak at your party conference. Cameron cosied up to McCain who has been the only major international speaker at the Tory conference since Cameron became leader. At least one Tory shadow cabinet member has been spotted sitting with Republicans at the McCain-Obama debates. While some Tory MPs keep Obama buttons in their pockets and I came across a Tory activist working for Obama, the Cameron-McCain link is another example of Cameron's shallow judgment on international politics.</p> <p>8) Talks about individuals not just families. Obama has dropped the tired Clinton line about hard-working families and now talks of hard-working Americans. This is right. In Britain, 30% of households are not family units. They are single people, widows, the divorced, parents alone. Tax policy now has to focus on the individual as much as the family.</p> <p>9) Don't promise too much. Obama is riding two waves. One is the deep sense of despair mixed with shame that the Bush-Cheney years have done so little for America at home and abroad. The second is a deeper tide-of-history movement that is bringing to an end the long 30-year era of global market capitalism which begun with the arrival of Thatcher and Reagan just as they ended the 30-year era of welfare state capitalism initiated after 1945. Americans hope Obama will be the new Roosevelt. He may be a new Carter. But underneath the rhetoric of change, Obama is centrist, cautious and careful in limiting specific pledges. But he is offering a tax cut to all middle- and working-class Americans.</p> <p>10) Don't fall for populism. Obama exudes thought and intellect. He can speak clearly and vividly. He acknowledges differences and seeks to bridge them, not use the culture and other wars throbbing in American civil society as a vehicle for partisan point-scoring. The arrival of 50 million non-Americans in the last 15 years as legal or illegal migrants has provoked political storms across the red (Republican)-blue (Democrat) divide. In Britain there is a loser-takes-all auction between politicians on immigration. Obama refuses to play that populist card and British politics could learn from him.</p>",

Photograph: Miguel Villagran/AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Miguel Villagran/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The newly-constructed American University of Afghanistan was supposed to herald a new era in Afghan-American relations. Instead, its affluent students are regular targets for attack and attempted kidnappings in an increasingly unstable Kabul. Some now believe foreign forces should leave and the Taliban come back into government.</p> <p>\"I think we have almost reached the point of no return. There are no good solutions left,\" said Ali Padsha, 19, who was raised in America. \"The longer foreign forces stay, the more problems will be created. When we [Afghans] see foreign forces in our country, it makes us crazy, it always has.</p> <p>\"The new Taliban are smarter than before and not as hardcore. They know what to do to keep the people happy.\"</p> <p>Seven years after the US-led invasion of Afghanistan, the situation is deteriorating rapidly. \"The rivers are running backwards,\" has become a popular lament in Kabul, whose residents are now looking to a change of leadership in America as the starting point for change in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Afghans generally favour Barack Obama. Some like him because he is the son of a Muslim, affectionately referring to him as Hussein Jan, adding Jan (an Afghan term of endearment) to his middle name. Many educated Afghans believe he has a more nuanced understanding of the regional predicament and support his plans to get tough with Pakistan. But others are cynical, seeing no difference between the candidates and viewing both men's commitment to sending more troops with hostility.</p> <p>Afghans face elections next year and are aware that the new American leader will play a defining role in determining who will be the next Afghan president. </p> <p>\"Whoever takes over America must bring a new leadership to Afghanistan,\" says Fahim Dashti, the editor of the popular Kabul Weekly. The victor will also have to work to counter the country's rampant anti-Americanism.</p> <p>\"The US has failed on everything they said they would do,\" says Dashti, a popular and influential thinker who fought with the Northern Alliance supported by America to drive out the Taliban in 2001.</p> <p>\"They said they were going to get rid of the Taliban - now the Taliban are at the edges of the city and even operating inside Kabul itself. They said they were going to end opium production but there is more opium than ever being produced. They said they were going to bring democracy but what we have is more like a dictatorship. Most people live beneath the poverty line and there is mass unemployment.\"</p> <p>Ali and his university friends are sympathetic to the incoming president. \"I feel bad for whoever wins this election,\" he said. \"They are going to have a really hard job cleaning up the mess left by the previous administration.\"<br><strong>Clancy Chassay</strong></p> <h2>Paris: 'Obama is France's ideal of the American dream'</h2> <p>Paris's Rue La Fayette, named after the great French hero of American independence, is known for its hordes of shopping US tourists. But struggling bars, hotels and even famous department stores are lamenting a fall in trade as US tourist numbers in Paris shrink to a record low. \"Business is down, we're all suffering,\" said Lionel Pinheiro, a waiter at one bistro. \"If Obama wins, I hope it might ease the financial crisis and bring the tourists back.\"</p> <p>Liberal Americans abroad have grown tired of having to apologise for their nationality during the Bush years. But France is now wondering: is it OK to start loving Americans again?</p> <p>\"We don't lynch Americans in the street,\" said Charlotte Lepri, a US specialist at the French thinktank, Institute for Research in Integrated Strategies (IRIS). \"But there are certain associations with Bush. Now there is a turnaround and real enthusiasm for a black candidate who represents France's ideal of the American dream.\"</p> <p>This new optimism could make it easier for the pro-US French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, to deepen rapprochement with Washington if Obama is elected. The latest poll shows over 70% of French people would vote for Obama. </p> <p>So great is the myth surrounding Obama, that some analysts warn the public could be in for a shock. The war in Afghanistan, France's increase in troops there and the growing death toll have unsettled public opinion. But few appear to realise that an Obama presidency will ask for more military involvement from allies. \"I don't think all French voters are aware of this part of his project, and they are going to get a surprise,\" said Jacques Mistral of the French Institute of International Relations (IFRI).<br><strong>Angelique Chrisafis</strong></p> <h2>Baghdad: 'The Republicans must finish their commitment'</h2> <p>Dr Amira Edan al-Dabab, above, has spent the past five years picking up the pieces of Iraq's plundered past and fears the results may again be lost if America elects Barack Obama.</p> <p>Since the fall of Baghdad in 2003, Edan, the director of the Iraqi Heritage and Antiquities Directorate, has been travelling the globe in search of up to 15,000 looted relics that used to comprise the essence of the National Museum of Iraq, treasures from three millennia which etched Iraq's place in the Arab heartland.</p> <p>Through half a decade of occupation, several years of brutal insurgency and attempts at sectarian cleansing, Iraq has seen tens of thousands of people killed, and at least two million leave. Security has improved and so too have prospects for some. But throughout Baghdad, many like Edan believe the country could again find itself at the edge of the precipice if the US doesn't tend to unfinished business.</p> <p>\"The Republicans must finish their commitment to Iraq, especially by signing the security treaty,\" she said. \"McCain is going to win,\" she continued. \"I read that the other man nominated is going to pull out the troops. We wish, we need and we hope that this won't happen.\"</p> <p>Most Iraqis seem more concerned about the short term. The time, they say, is not even nearly ripe for the Americans to leave and - for now - they'd rather the devil they know.</p> <p>Twenty kilometres north of Baghdad, the Tarmeya and Qadr district was until earlier this year the most active spot in the most dangerous area of Iraq. But the worm has turned. Tarmeyah is no longer an al-Qaida safe haven and McCain is seen as the best bet to keep it that way. </p> <p>\"If they go now, we may as well all leave too,\" said Bassam Jassam, from the region's dominant tribe, the Mashadani. \"McCain is best for us now. But we need to get through the next two years and after that all the Americans can leave.\"</p> <p>\"The thing we need is stability and strength,\" said Edan. \"If that goes, and it could, all of this could go again. There is so much at stake for us.\"<br><strong>Martin Chulov</strong></p> <h2>Beijing: 'America is going down while China is rising up'</h2> <p>Rao Jin has a soft spot for Barack Obama; he's drawn to his friendly face as well as admiring his personal achievements. But the hero of young Chinese nationalists stops well short of an endorsement.</p> <p>\"I hope the next president can really change the way the US deals with things, always using weapons or economic sanctions,\" says the 24-year-old founder of anti-CNN.com. \"The election has been a hot topic on our site. [But] one individual can't change much. Both Obama and McCain are standing for certain interest groups, and both of them will serve for America's benefit.\"</p> <p>Rao's website became a rallying point for fenqing (\"angry youth\") after the international storm over Tibet this year. He says it is not nationalist; merely a counterweight to western media bias and hegemony.</p> <p>For many in China, the US epitomises Occidental aggression and hypocrisy: preaching free trade but practising protectionism; idealising democracy while allowing vast donations; using human rights to justify invading Iraq.</p> <p>Some hope that Obama's mixed parentage and peripatetic childhood have made him more sympathetic to other cultures. He's popular among the young and there's fascination at the prospect of a black president - and what that would say about US tolerance of differences.</p> <p>But younger people are not counting on America to change itself. Many see the end of its global dominance as inevitable, given China's growing economic and international power.</p> <p>\"America is going down, while China is rising up,\" said Rao. Hu Ben, erstwhile Chinese subtitler for The West Wing and international editor for a major portal, added: \"A lot of young people still think America is our enemy. They're quite happy with the sub-prime crisis - they think this is China's chance.\"</p> <p>Officials and analysts also seem relaxed about the election result. The \"China card\" has been waved less often in this race than previous campaigns. They sense an emerging, broadly optimistic bipartisan consensus on Sino-US relations. John McCain appears more hawkish on security issues and relations with Taiwan, but Obama seems tougher on trade, Tibet, human rights and environmental protection.</p> <p>\"There will be differences on detailed issues, but the big picture won't change whoever wins,\" predicted Jin Canrong, associate dean of the School of International Studies at Renmin University.<br><strong>Tania Branigan</strong></p> <h2>Moscow: 'We don't beg from the west any more'</h2> <p>With its padded vinyl seats, chrome fittings and Wurlitzer jukebox, the famous Starlite Diner is a little corner of small-town America right in the heart of Moscow. When it opened in 1994, Russia was reeling in post-Soviet turmoil and was trying to court the west for much-needed investment.</p> <p>\"That's all changed now,\" said Sergei Demidov, 35, a banker, tucking into a plate of tenderloin steak and fries. \"We don't beg from the west any more and Washington can't order us around like it did in the 1990s.\"</p> <p>Relations between the US and a resurgent Russia hit a post-cold war low this summer after a fierce proxy conflict in former Soviet Georgia. Most Russians see the US as an aggressive bully that wants to encircle and weaken their country - regardless of whether a Democrat or a Republican is in charge.</p> <p>Barack Obama, however, is widely perceived as the lesser of two evils. A survey in October by Moscow's Levada Centre polling agency showed that 35% of Russians supported Obama, with 14% for John McCain and 37% confessing no sympathy for either. \"Obama would be better,\" said Maria Balandina, 26, an arts events manager. \"He's a democrat, he was against the war in Iraq, he's young.\"</p> <p>Former Vietnam pilot McCain, on the other hand, has called for Russia to be ousted from the G8 for allegedly backsliding on democracy and famously claimed he saw only the letters K-G-B in the eyes of Vladimir Putin (unlike George Bush, who thought he glimpsed the Russian leader's soul).</p> <p>However, observers say Obama's messianic zeal for reform inside America may not transform into a clear foreign policy. McCain, while a tough talker, might be more convenient for Kremlin hardliners who identify with his blunt rhetoric. \"Obama represents a new challenge for Moscow,\" said Andrei Kortunov, an analyst from the New Eurasia foundation. \"I'm just not sure Russia is ready for that challenge quite yet.\" <br><strong>Tom Parfitt</strong></p> <h2>Tehran: 'I'm not optimistic it will make much difference'</h2> <p>Rhythmic chants of \"Marg bar Amrika\" - \"death to America\" - boomed from loudspeakers in the streets as the crowd warmed up for Friday prayers, in an event unchanged since the 1979 revolution.</p> <p>Ayatollah Mohammad Emami-Kashani, frail but imposing in the white turban and brown robes of a senior cleric, lambasted \"global arrogance\". That is shorthand for the US, but he spells it out anyway. \"The claims the US makes against Iran are wrong. The world is waking up to its lies.\"</p> <p>Weekly prayers combine politics and religion, agitprop with faith. Mullahs, militiamen and civilians, including schoolchildren, are bussed in to sit on the mosque's pale green carpets. Women in black chadors are kept separate behind a screen. Kashani does not mention Barack Obama, though there is plenty of discussion of whether victory for him will do anything to improve relations between these old enemies.</p> <p>Iran's nuclear ambitions - which it insists are peaceful - and its role and influence in Iraq, Lebanon and Palestine, have kept it locked in confrontation with the US since George Bush included the Islamic republic in his \"axis of evil\" address in 2002. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, seemed to be signalling no change ahead last week when he called Iran's dispute with America \"deep-seated\". </p> <p>Still, Mohammad Khatami, the reformist former president, has spoken of \"new possibilities\" if Obama wins. Parliamentary speaker Ali Larijani found the Illinois senator \"more rational\" than John McCain.</p> <p>By coincidence, the word obama is close to the Farsi for \"with us,\" though few believe a Democratic victory will be enough to draw the sting from this relationship. Some think all the change must come from the US side - an unlikely prospect. \"I'm not optimistic it will make much difference to Iran,\" Mohsen Rezaei, ex-commander of the Revolutionary Guards, told the Guardian.</p> <p>Others hope it will. \"The countries that have good relations with the US see the benefits,\" said Mehdi, a young consultant, walking past Tehran's \"nest of spies\" - the old US embassy, still festooned in angry slogans. \"We should consider that.\"<br><strong>Ian Black</strong></p> <h2>Lahore: 'McCain understands the Pakistan reality better'</h2> <p>The liberal elite at Pakistan's most prestigious university, which offers American-style business education, look like their peers anywhere around the world. Except here many are backing John McCain.</p> <p>The students at the Lahore University of Management Sciences are not drawn to McCain as a person, saying that Barack Obama is far more appealing, but many believe McCain will be better for Pakistan, a view that is widely held across the country.</p> <p>It all goes back to Obama's statement that he would order unilateral and immediate strikes against Osama bin Laden in Pakistan if intelligence pointed to him being present in the country.</p> <p>\"Obama has stated, so clearly, that 'I'm going to attack Pakistan',\" said economics student Motahar Saleheen, between classes at the sprawling LUMS campus. \"One nation should not be allowed to interfere with the sovereignty of another.\"</p> <p>In Pakistan, Obama's remarks have been distilled down to a commitment to \"bomb Pakistan\", causing fury in a country fearful of becoming the next theatre of war in Washington's anti-terror fight.</p> <p>\"Tomorrow, if Obama attacks Pakistan, we will all rise up to defend ourselves, and the western media will brand us all terrorists,\" said fellow student Shahzad Mehboob.</p> <p>Even before Obama's position on Pakistan was known, there has long been a belief in the county that Republicans are more Pakistan-friendly than Democrats, rooted in the massive financial and military aid provided by he Eisenhower, Reagan and Bush presidencies to Islamabad.</p> <p>Pakistan has been a key ally of the Bush administration, which heavily backed the military-led regime of former president Pervez Musharraf, so the change in US president could have a profound impact on the country.</p> <p>\"John McCain understands the Pakistan reality better,\" said politics undergraduate Osama Khawar. \"But as a human being Obama is a better candidate. It's a dilemma for us.\"<br><strong>Saeed Shah</strong></p> <h2>Nairobi: 'Whether you're black or white, vote for Barack'</h2> <p>For reggae fans there is Makadem, for rock, Extra Golden. Folk lovers have Kenge Kenge while Tony Nyadundo offers a more traditional sound.</p> <p>All have recently released songs in Kenya with a common word in the title - Obama - and a similar message.</p> <p>\"If you're voting for real change, Barack Obama be the right man, whether you're black or white, young or old, vote for Barack, Barack Obama,\" sings Makadem, who launched the video for \"Obama be thy name\" at Nairobi's National Theatre last week.</p> <p>Obama-mania in Kenya is no surprise. The Democratic candidate's late father was Kenyan, and many of his relatives, including his 87-year-old step-grandmother Mama Sarah, still live here. Neither is it a recent phenomenon; during his Obama's trip to Kenya in 2006, thousands turned out to see him.</p> <p>But the presidential campaign has lifted the excitement to a new level. Obama's face now appears on many of the ubiquitous Matatu minibus taxis, thousands of bumper stickers bear his name. Locally printed campaign T-shirts are selling fast; one features the slogan \"Ndio Tunaweza\" - Swahili for \"Yes we can\". A musical based on Obama's memoir is set to open. Underlying the enthusiasm, is aspiration: many people still believe strongly in the American dream; Kenya has more students studying in the US than any other African country. And Obama, whose father travelled to Hawaii on a scholarship, is the ultimate embodiment of that immigrant dream.</p> <p>Policy-wise, a more nuanced US approach to terrorism issues, especially in places like Somalia, might be expected. But the biggest change may be intangible. One Kenyan columnist wrote this week an Obama win would unleash a \"momentum of enlightenment\" proving that talent and character rather than ethnicity and power should determine success.<br><strong>Xan Rice</strong></p> <h2>Gaza: 'Without pressure on Israel there's no solution'</h2> <p>Only a few years ago the bright yellow and orange al-Awda Factory for Biscuits and Ice Cream was a vibrant business and one of the largest factories in the Palestinian territories. Today, like most private firms in the Gaza Strip, it is in dire trouble.</p> <p>Only one of four production lines is working. There are barely two-dozen staff producing packets of hazelnut-flavoured wafers. There is not enough ink to print a sell-by date, not enough cardboard boxes to hold the packets, not enough plastic to wrap the boxes. When the wafers are delivered, they arrive at stores in old fruit cartons. Sales are down to 25% of what they were eight years ago. And this is a good day - for the previous week all production lines were shut down for want of ingredients, packaging and spare parts.</p> <p>The factors that have brought the biscuit factory to such a parlous state will be one of many unenviable Middle East challenges awaiting the new president.</p> <p>Since the Islamist movement Hamas won Palestinian elections in 2006 and then took full control of Gaza last year, Israel has gradually increased the pressure on what it calls the \"hostile entity\". It has severely limited imports and prohibited all exports. Few of Gaza's 1.5 million people can ever leave. Despite this, Hamas grows steadily stronger, not weaker.</p> <p>Like many Gazans, Mohammed Telbani, the factory's general manager, says he has little interest in the election. \"Presidents have changed but no one did anything for us,\" he said, waving his hand dismissively. He doubts that a new president will have the power or the will to reverse decades of US policy in the Middle East which he, like most here, sees as decisively pro-Israeli. \"Without pressure on Israel there won't be any solution to the problem,\" he said.</p> <p>If they had to choose, most Palestinians, like most other Arabs, would probably side with Obama (and, conversely, opinion polls show more Israelis would side with McCain). Gazans talk urgently about the need to lift the economic blockade of the strip, to allow the crossings to open and the economy to restart. Palestinians as a whole simply want Washington to play a much tougher role as a Middle East peace broker, bringing concrete change and eventually that much-promised independent Palestinian state.<br><strong>Rory McCarthy</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Monday November 3 2008.

  "<p>Barack Obama's team moved quickly to exploit what it viewed as a late and unexpected campaign gift - the endorsement of John McCain in a rare public appearance by the vice-president, Dick Cheney.</p> <p>In contrast with President George Bush's absence from the campaign trail at the weekend, Cheney flew to his home state, Wyoming, to speak at a rally in support of the Republican ticket.</p> <p>\"John is a man who understands the danger facing America,\" Cheney told a rally in Laramie on Saturday. \"He's a man who has looked into the face of evil and not flinched, he's a man who is comfortable with responsibility, and has been since he joined the armed forces at the age of 17. He has earned our support and confidence, and the time is now to make him commander in chief.\"</p> <p>The endorsement may help McCain among loyal Republicans, but not with Americans disenchanted with the Bush-Cheney administration, or among independents angry over the stewardship of the past eight years.</p> <p>McCain has been at pains to distance himself from the administration, pointedly saying in the final presidential debate that he was not Bush.</p> <p>Obama's team, whose campaign theme is that McCain would represent a continuation of the Bush-Cheney administration, put out an ad within 90 minutes of Cheney's endorsement, as well as placing a clip of Cheney's speech on YouTube. The 30-second ad says: \"Barack Obama. Endorsed by Warren Buffett and Colin Powell. And John McCain's latest endorsement?\" </p> <p>Cheney had announced his endorsement for McCain before, but, like Bush, had been largely absent from the campaign trail during the past two months. His decision to participate in the Laramie rally at the weekend was prompted partly by a desire to speak on behalf of Republican congressional candidates and to deliver what amounted to an emotional look back on his career. He will retire from politics on inauguration day, January 20.</p> <p>He told the rally he had begun campaigning for a place in Congress in 1978. \"I've had a long career in politics, though today, looking back, it seems to have passed in the blink of an eye.\"</p> <p>He devoted most of his speech to praising the congressional candidates, but included passages on McCain, and, in particular, Sarah Palin, who is closer to Cheney's brand of conservatism, saying of her: \"I'm pleased that he has chosen a running mate with executive talent, toughness and common sense.\"</p>",
  "<p>Life is better between the covers of a Mills &amp; Boon novel. The women seek happiness, and find it eventually. Happiness means a man, naturally. And, more specifically, the kiss of a man. Not just any man, mind: a M&amp;B man. This is a different species altogether from the miserable creatures of the real world - tall, broad-shouldered, strong of jaw, and arrogant of manner. They prowl like tigers, have a tendency to be brutish and rapacious, especially in their kissing (which always involves him cupping her face in his hands), and they know that a woman needs to feel wanted. To be honest, I wouldn't look out of place in a Mills &amp; Boon novel. </p> <p>The good news is that romance is not dead. It's alive and well and celebrating its 100th birthday. We are too, with <strong>Consuming Passion: 100 Years of Mills &amp; Boon</strong> (BBC4, Sunday). This is a lovely drama. Dead clever too: three stories - from the 1900s, the 1970s and now - artfully plaited together. All that ties the disparate strands is this strange publishing house that for a century has been churning out the same story, millions and millions of times. </p> <p>Poor Mrs Boon. Mr Boon may have understood the market, but he couldn't have starred in one of the books he published: he just didn't get that bit about women needing to feel wanted. Seventy years later, an aspiring M&amp;B author, played with a nice mixture of comedy and tragedy by Peep Show's Olivia Colman, knows exactly what romance is; she just can't find it in the real world. It's left to the most unlikely of the three women to find Mills &amp; Boon love. Emilia Fox, taking a break from dissecting dead bodies in Silent Witness, is a 21st-century English lecturer, teaching a course in romantic fiction. Of course she knows Mills &amp; Boon is all utter nonsense, laughable fantasy. But then: enter tall, broad-shouldered man, strong of jaw and arrogant of manner. Go on, cup her face ... Yes, he does! And a lot more besides. Emilia melts, dumps her boring, passionless, cooking-and-property-price boyfriend. Romance has triumphed again. Plus we get to see her in the buff, and there's not much more romantic than that. </p> <p>There are further birthday celebrations in <strong>How To Write a Mills &amp; Boon</strong> (BBC4, Sunday). Trying is Stella Duffy, a serious, literary novelist. M&amp;B is way, way out of Stella's comfort zone; her thing is more along the lines of lesbian-noir-realism. Or something. </p> <p>It would have been very easy for her to be sniffy and condescending about Mills &amp; Boon, but to her credit she's the opposite. She has a real go at it - listens to people, goes on a writing course in Tuscany (prime M&amp;B territory), stifles her attempts to write what she wants to write. And she succeeds, in that the editor likes what she's done and would have taken it on had Stella wanted to continue with it. </p> <p>The programme is a success too - for one because Stella Duffy, as well as throwing herself into it whole-heartedly, is very good company (not many novelists make good TV). But also because of all the amazing Mills &amp; Boon ladies she meets along the way: the editor, the established writer who's teaching the course in Italy, the aspiring writers, the fans. They're all brilliant, clever, funny, women. Modern, even. But they also understand that romance - and cuppy-kissing - lives on. </p> <p><strong>The Choice</strong> (More4, Saturday) is the one between Barack Obama and John McCain. Not such a hard one, then. But, of course, it's not ours. This is an American film, with a new narration by Jon Snow. And it's a very good documentary too, a serious look at both candidates and how they got to this point, including interviews with all the right people. Everything you need, in fact, to make up your mind, if you haven't so done already. Except, of course, we don't get to choose. </p> <p>But hell, you know what? It should be our election, too. The outcome doesn't matter just to them, but to the whole damn world. Maybe we could have our say. It's not too late. </p> <p>So write ... no, it is too late for that - phone, then, help them make up their minds. I'm sure they'd appreciate it. Somewhere marginal would be good - Clark County, say, in Ohio. According to my research, that's 001 followed by 937 for Springfield, followed by seven digits. Mention the Guardian. Good luck ...</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-339258916\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>Maybe Sarah Palin should have caught on when the caller purporting to be Nicolas Sarkozy told her he could see Belgium from the Elys\u00e9e Palace.</p> <p>But the Republicans' vice-presidential candidate remained blissfully unaware during the six-minute conversation with a Montreal comedian that she was the victim of a prank - even after the fake Sarkozy said his wife, Carla Bruni, was hot in bed, and slipped in a line in French about how fun it was to kill baby seals.</p> <p>The caller, Marc-Antoine Audette, was one half of a comedic duo called the Masked Avengers. Audette described his call with Palin as his greatest triumph.</p> <p>The prank on one of the most heavily protected personalities in US politics was an instant internet sensation in the final hours of the presidential campaign.</p> <p>It also overshadowed what John McCain had orchestrated as his comedic moment - an appearance on Saturday Night Live with his wife, Cindy. McCain used his turn to try to make light of Obama's dominance of television advertising, saying his campaign only had the money to appear on the shopping channel - where his wife displayed campaign jewellery.</p> <p>\"I'm a true maverick - a Republican without money,\" he joked. He went on to lay out a number of strategies for trying to overcome Barack Obama's lead including one he called \"Sad Grandpa\".</p> <p>\"That's where I get on TV and go, 'Come on, Obama's gonna have plenty of chances to be president. It's my turn',\" he said. But instead, it was Palin who got the most laughs - albeit inadvertently. The telephone call got off to an auspicious start.</p> <p>Palin, evidently thrilled to take what she had been told by aides was a call from the French leader, told the faux Sarkozy within a matter of seconds that she loved him. She did her best to keep that love alive, even when the conversation took an increasingly bizarre turn. When her caller pointed out the two have a lot in common \"except from my house I can see Belgium\", Palin cheerfully responded: \"Well, see, we're right next door to different countries that we all need to be working with.\"</p> <p>When her caller mentioned his love of hunting, Palin instantly invited him on a hunting trip. \"We can have a lot of fun together while we're getting work done. We could kill two birds with one stone,\" she said. \"Exactly,\" the caller responded. \"We could go try hunting by helicopter like you did.\"</p> <p>He added in French that the pair could also go out and kill baby seals. Switching to English the caller added: \"I just love killing those animals. Mmm, mmm, take away life, that is so fun.\" The exchange was littered with other clues. The fake Sarkozy mentioned an adviser called Johnny Hallyday who was in contact with the McCain campaign. Palin, who has made much of her contacts with Canadian officials in her negotiations over an oil pipeline through Alaska, might well have been expected to catch on when the caller got the name of Canada's prime minister wrong, substituting that of a singer.</p> <p>Or when he added that Bruni was jealous of Palin. But the vice-presidential candidate evidently missed those cues - or at least was too polite to raise objections even when her caller extravagantly praised a porn film about her.</p> <p>In interviews at the weekend, Audette said it had taken five days to get clearance from Palin's communications team as well as the Secret Service for the phone call.</p> <p>\"I wanted to see how she was on an intellectual level,\" he told the Canadian Press. \"You can see that she's, well, not really brilliant.\"</p>",
  "<p>Your leader on the US presidential election (October 27) referred to \"the two US presidential candidates\". There are, in fact, six candidates. The others, in addition to Obama and McCain, are: Ralph Nader, Independent; former congresswoman Cynthia McKinney, Green party, who is black; former congressman Bob Barr, Libertarian party; and Baptist pastor and radio talkshow host Chuck Baldwin, Constitution party. They get little, if any, mention in your paper and clearly have no hope of getting to the White House.

She is someone who comes through to do good, despite corporate, political and illegal adversity. Hopefully, this bodes well for the Obama campaign. <br><strong>Stewart Eaton</strong><br>Cologne, Germany</p> <p>The video report from Kansas City, Missouri, moved me to tears (Meet Joe 12 Pack - an Obama volunteer, October 29). As an American who has lived in Scotland for 17 years, I find the efforts of the Obama-Biden volunteers there utterly remarkable.

  "<p>You're a British broadcaster and you want to report the US election. How do you do it? The traditional answer is as straightforward as it is bizarre. You grab a producer, a camera crew and a man or woman with a microphone. Then you stick them in a backless tent on a rooftop in the nation's capital and tell the viewers back home you're \"reporting live from Washington\". Which, of course, you are. Sort of.</p> <p>Actually, it's a bit more complicated than that. You can't choose any old patch of concrete in the sky. It has to be a rooftop with a direct view of the president's official residence. Who would doubt the veracity of a news anchor if the White House can be seen over his right shoulder?</p> <p>If you think this sounds daft, it is. But it is also a tried-and-tested formula practised without question by TV companies from around the world.</p> <p>During the 2004 US election, I spent a few days on the roof of Washington's Chamber of Commerce building, where there were five broadcasters, including Sky, the BBC and Japan's NHK - and perhaps 20 more tents on neighbouring rooftops. All the residents of this broadcasting shantytown were making the same promise to their viewers back home: that they could paint a picture of a country while being almost totally cut off from it.</p> <p>So why has Sky News taken over a 1940s colonial-style mansion in Florida, 1,000 miles from Washington, and created its own \"White House\" from which to present its pre-election coverage? I've spent the week watching behind the scenes.</p> <p>Last Monday, at just after 12.30pm UK time - breakfast time in Miami - the Sky anchor Andrew Wilson straightened his back, peered authoritatively into the camera and welcomed viewers to \"the official start of our US election coverage\". The presidential candidates and their deputies \"have all said they're turning their backs on Washington and taking this election to the people\", he said. \"So we're going to take it away from Washington as well.\"</p> <p>Here's what he didn't say: the home's owner, a wealthy French businessman, has been packed off to the Ritz with his family - along with a fat cheque and a promise that the cameramen won't break the family mementos that the director is carefully keeping out of view.</p> <p>This will give you an idea of the splendour of the building: its owner employs two nannies, two maids and a chef. The racing driver Eddie Irvine lives next door, and the tennis star Anna Kournikova is a few houses down. Sky may be living in a real house - but it's not quite Main Street USA. A local property expert tells me the home is worth around $12m (\u00a37m). </p> <p>Sky won't say what it's paying for the house - but the police officer permanently stationed outside the door (one of the conditions set by the state's film commission) is costing more than $800 a day. Which is quite a lot of money to pay a man to sit in his car eating cake, drinking Coke and watching action movies on DVD.</p> <p>Wilson, a former US correspondent, tells me why Sky has decamped. \"The candidates aren't [in Washington] and neither are the voters. But here in Florida, Obama is spending more on TV advertising than in any other state. That's because it's pretty much true that whoever wins Florida wins the election.\"</p> <p>Barack Obama and John McCain have brought their campaigns here recently, and there are leaflets shoved at you constantly - something that doesn't happen in DC, undisputed Democratic territory.</p> <p>Even if a replica White House is essentially a visual gag, this is a clever way to bring in voices that wouldn't be heard 45m up in the air in Washington DC. Throughout the week, I brush past local politicians, radio talk-show hosts, psephologists, activists and ordinary voters as they make their way to the house's \"oval office\" or the \"situation room\".</p> <p>But the availability of guests is not, of course, the sole reason Sky is here. There are aesthetic considerations too. The swimming pool provides an alluring backdrop on to which Sky can project its opinion poll graphics (unfortunately called the \"pool of polls\"). And a huge crane enables a camera to swoop up and over to show the cobalt sea at its sparkly best.</p> <p>Certainly the crew seem to think they've landed a plum job (I watch the sound-man one day with an onerous duty: making sure the fronds of a palm tree do not flap in front of the camera lens). But it's not just Wilson and his team who are pleased that Sky has landed in Miami. I knock at the window of the police car outside. The cop winds down his window and switches off the DVD player on the passenger seat.</p> <p>What's your role here? I ask naively. \"I'm here to make sure no one goes in who shouldn't,\" he says with a twinkle. \"But no one really knows they're here anyway. So there's not a lot to do.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Sky News election coverage continues from across the US and on <a href=\"http://news.sky.com/skynews/\">skynews.com</a></p>",
  "<p>This US election has proved that everything is bigger in America - including politics. Take advertising, for instance. On TV, radio and even in computer games Barack Obama has so far out-advertised John McCain by three-and-a-half to one, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group, spending an average of $3.5m (\u00a32m) a day - not including the 30-minute adverts he bought on most of the major networks last week at a rumoured cost of $3m. </p> <p>But even if the candidates aren't paying for airtime, they're still on TV. The final presidential debate was watched by more than 60 million people, and the cable news networks CNN and MSNBC, which specialise in political coverage, are up 165% and 81% in primetime respectively as compared with the same quarter last year. </p> <p>Then there is, of course, the Sarah Palin effect. Her speech at the Republican national convention, where she was introduced for the first time, matched Obama's historic convention speech in audience figures and beat the Academy awards, the Olympics opening ceremony and even the final of American Idol, with around 40 million viewers. </p> <p>Clips from Palin's calamitous interview with CBS's Katie Couric were viewed 6m times on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/\">YouTube</a>. And those clips proved to be gold dust for the other great winners in this election cycle - late-night comics. </p> <p>Tina Fey's impression of a bumbling Palin on NBC's comedy staple Saturday Night Live saw ratings for the show, which had been subdued, jump 44% in viewers compared with last year. When Palin herself appeared, the show pulled in 17 million viewers, a huge number given the time slot. Other cable comedians also profited from campaign missteps on both sides, with Comedy Central's satirical The Daily Show and The Colbert Report averaging 1.8 and 1.4 million viewers a show, both up 16% year on year. The Daily Show had its highest-ever rating, 3.6 million, when Obama appeared on it last week. David Letterman got his highest viewing figures in three years when McCain, who had stood him up previously, returned to face the music in mid-October, attracting 6.5 million viewers. </p> <p>According to Bill Wolff, the executive producer of the Rachel Maddow Show, a new political show that MSNBC launched to immediate primetime ratings success: \"2004 was a big deal, but this is incredible.\" Wolff thinks the rise in figures across the board comes from a widespread dislike of the Bush administration and an eagerness to engage in choosing new leaders as a result. \"The other part of it is the amazing personalities in play over a dramatic, compelling, different and unpredictable race,\" he says. \"The news has transcended its normal audience. People who usually watch sports are watching politics to see who's going to win. It's become the national obsession.\"</p> <p>And it isn't just TV shows that have benefited - news and political websites have enjoyed huge increases too. <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/\">Politico.com</a> has seen a 219% increase in unique users year on year, according to the ratings company Nielsen. The websites of the <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/\">LA Times</a>, <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/us\">Wall Street Journal</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/\">New York Post</a>, <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe\">Boston Globe</a>, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/?lid=ABCCOMGlobalMenu&amp;lpos=News\">ABC</a> and <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/\">Fox News</a> are up around 100%, and the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/\">New York Times</a>, <a href=\"http://news.google.com/\">Google News</a> and <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/\">MSNBC Digital Network</a> have increased traffic by around 40%.</p> <p>\"The web lends itself to immediacy, so when people have a passionate and visceral reaction to something they see, and they're thinking about it, they can go right to a website,\" says Chuck Schilling, the research director for agency and media analytics at Nielsen. </p> <p>But what will happen when the election is over? Will traffic hold up? Schilling thinks that news websites, and video clip sites such as those for The Daily Show and Saturday Night Live, may be able to retain some of their new users after the election. So it may not just be McCain or Obama who wins tomorrow.</p>",
  "<p><strong>I am a woman but I hate wearing high heels. Is there any hope for me?</strong></p> <p><strong>Sara Miller</strong>, by email</p> <p>Mystic Meg I may not be (despite the nightly exercises, my voice remains dismayingly unbreathy) but a vision is coming before me. I see a time, a time in the none too distant future when our progeny's progeny's progeny's progeny will look back in wonderment that women ever wore high heels at all, and will regard the perverted practice the way we think of corsets: as a torturous form of masochism that women willingly subjected themselves to in the name of creating what is perceived to be a better shape.</p> <p>I'm not going to lie to you. Round here, like John McCain we live on the Straight Talk Express. So, yes, it is true, a lengthened leg does look thinner and, um, longer emerging from a high heel than a stumpy flat. But so does a defined waist compared to a solid trunk: that doesn't mean that one should contort one's body and damage one's health to achieve this effect. Having bigger eyes is largely assumed to be a nice thing but that doesn't mean we should all walk around with toothpicks stretching out our lids. (Don't get any ideas, designer folk.)</p> <p>Going back to the corset analogy, one this column plans to hammer out to the death today, this is yet another example of an idea of human aesthetics taken too far. Yes, a defined waist is a good thing: a waist that is freakishly shrunk to 43cm (17in), and with the crushed ribs to prove it, is not. Similarly, long legs are always welcome. Legs shoved up on weird little toothpicks, forcing the knees to go all bandy-like and the lower spine to be crushed downwards, are not. The legs are meant to be longer naturally, not attenuated by you standing on your tiptoes, see? High heels may be synonymous with sexy but the grumpiness, pain and immobility that tend to be high heels' side-effects mitigate any of the alleged sexiness the shoes bring. Just as there is something very disturbing about seeing a woman whose waist is half the circumference of her hips (as anyone who's seen a photo of Dita von Teese romping naked - and who hasn't? - knows), is there not something comical about seeing a room full of women trotting about on their tippy toes? Is there not something \"small children make-believing at being grown-ups\" about the whole look? Are there enough rhetorical questions in this column yet? </p> <p>Ladies of the world, unite! Come down to my stumpy level and fight against this nonsensical tyranny, you know it makes sense. I may rise on a lower plane in the physical world, but in the land of moral rectitude, I rise high above them all.</p> <p><strong>I have been noticing an increasing number of young women wearing leather leggings. Is this advisable?</strong></p> <p><strong>Milly Valentine</strong>, by email</p> <p>Oh, I love a good spoon-feeding, I do. Bless you, my readers, for making my daily job as light and lovely as free-floating feather.</p> <p>Of course leather leggings aren't advisable. The name itself rather gives it away: there is leather, which only looks good on Bruce Springsteen and cows, and there are leggings, which look good on no one. </p> <p>But I'll give designers this: they aren't half clever. Rarely has a garment fitted in so neatly to the current teen and twentysomething zeitgeist as a pair of leather leggings. This is a generation that likes to get its legs out, hence the enduring popularity of short shorts, even in the winter, and the seemingly unstoppable rise of leggings. But it is also one, as we discussed last week in regard to band T-shirts, that has a strangely sepia-hued view of the 1960s and scuzzy rockers. I blame Kate Moss for all of this, and I'm increasingly blaming Peaches Geldof, too, for this and many, many other blights on my life. </p> <p>It may seem extreme to take Peaches as a representative of any section of the human race, but an afternoon unwisely spent in the atrium of Topshop should prove to any sniffing doubters that she does seem to be the template for a whole demographic in this country. Hence, leather leggings: they show off the legs while simultaneously looking like something Nikki Sixx might have worn which, to the astonishment of us oldies, now seems to be A Good Thing as opposed to A Health Hazard. Now, some of you may be eating your breakfast. Some may have a more finely developed sense of decorum than moi. So relying on the crutch of euphemism, it's this concern for the nation's health that really worries me about this garment. They surely can't do one's bits many favours, right? And, oh my stars, imagine what a pain it would be to go to the loo. It's these kinds of searing inquiries that gives this page its reputation for being like a combination of Diana Vreeland and Seymour Hersh.</p> <p>\u2022 Post questions to Ask Hadley, The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER. email: <a href=\"mailto:ask.hadley@theguardian.com\">ask.hadley@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<h2>Danit Brown</h2> <p>The day after the election, I saw <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> standing in the produce aisle of my local grocery store, wearing an \"I voted\" sticker and holding a cantaloupe. Outside, his wife waited in a station-wagon pointed north. \"What's he doing in Michigan?\" my husband wanted to know. \"Where are his bodyguards?\" Already, someone had driven through our town and taken down all the signs promising change, requisitioning them for fuel for a bonfire so large that the planes taking off and landing at the airport two towns over were going to be able see it. Even now, we could catch faint whiffs of burning posterboard whenever the A/C kicked on. \"Change, my ass,\" said the cashier who rang up our bottled water, first-aid kit and the masking tape we were going to use to keep our windows from shattering. \"I hear they're closing the border to Canada.\" In the produce aisle, Obama set down the cantaloupe and picked up a tomato. We all pretended not to see. I imagined walking up to him, taking his hand, saying, \"Come to my house. Stay with me. We have cable and a foldout sofa, and a gun for protection.\" I imagined his fingers, warm and dry, in mine. I liked him. He was handsome: tall, thin, a father of girls. In the voting booth, the day before, I'd pictured White House interns flashing their thongs, the leaders of nations peeling grapes and swooning, the Oval Office a den of love. How could they help it? I was miles and miles away from Washington, my finger poised over the lever, and on the other side of the privacy curtain, my husband - short and white and blotchy - was coughing politely: I'd already taken too long. Behind us, the line of voters stretched out the door, across the parking lot. I thought I was the only one, but later, on the news, they'd reported I wasn't, that thousands of us had turned in blank ballots, unable, finally, to cast a vote for a world whose rules we didn't know. \"Who does that?\" my husband had muttered, his nostrils flaring the way they do when he lies. \"Beats me,\" I said. \"Beats me.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Danit Brown is the author of Ask For A Convertible, a collection of short stories. </p> <h2>Hari Kunzru</h2> <p>Here in New York, we're still reeling. The victory celebrations had a tinge of mania to them. For one night, we allowed ourselves to believe that it was the beginning of a new era. Post-racial! Post-feminist! Post-culture wars! Post-Bush! Grumpy Grampy and Caribou Barbie didn't win through, at least not here. But the real undercurrent of hysteria wasn't the thwarted assassination attempt by that splinter group from the Michigan Militia, but the unwelcome knowledge that we've entered the Post-Boom. America's world dominance is over. There'll be no new buildings in NYC for at least 10 years. Brooklyn thirtysomethings are resigning themselves to being in debt for ever. Upper East Side pre-schools are offering Chinese as standard. The bank back-office staff are carrying their cardboard boxes to the door and the hipsters are rubbing their hands in anticipation of a revival of the golden era of downtown - cheap rents, cheap drugs, empty spaces to hold parties. Yes, once the yuppies retreat there shall be punk poetry and DIY experimental sound-art for all. One vast pop-cultural reenactment - every nuance of No-Wave studied and recreated. We're only a month in, and Obama's decision to raise tariffs to \"save the economy\" hasn't really hit home. There's no money for social programs (we gave it all to bail out Goldman Sachs, remember?) so we can kiss goodbye to free healthcare, or indeed any social protection for the poor. It's dog-eat-dog time, and the big dogs have the best lobbyists. The president's got a timetable to leave Iraq, but economists are beginning to point out that America only got out of the last Depression by having a really big war. Lend-lease 2.0? i-Munitions? It's definitely the way to go. All we need is an enemy. The ragheads didn't really work out. But hey, things are hotting up in the Russian border states.

His debut novel, The Impressionist, won the Betty Trask award and the Somerset Maugham award.</p> <h2>Kevin Brockmeier</h2> <p>As late as November 3, no one could have imagined that the election would culminate the way it did. Certainly I couldn't. </p> <p>After all, who would have guessed that the worst accusations lobbied against John McCain by Barack Obama's most fervent supporters, and against Barack Obama by John McCain's, would turn out to be true? That Barack Obama was indeed a covert Muslim terrorist - and also, simultaneously, a radical black Christian - whose true agenda was to disenfranchise white Americans, institute a broad-based socialist agenda of government hand-outs and immense taxation, then hand the whole nation over to the terrorists and retire to an island in the Caribbean? That John McCain was in fact a doddering old fool - and also, simultaneously, a vicious ultra-conservative mastermind - whose actual goal was to deprive middle-class Americans of healthcare, job opportunities and all their hard-earned social freedoms before dying a year into office and allowing Sarah Palin to assume the mantle of power, appointing Dick Cheney her vice-president and puppet-master? And that it would all come to light on the afternoon before election day, in a fashion so conspicuous and indisputable?</p> <p>It was a dispiriting turn of events, to say the least. </p> <p>Of course, most Americans, horrified by the choice with which they suddenly had been presented - a terrorist on one ticket and a dictator on the other - and unable to fathom voting for the Libertarians or (God forbid) the Greens, chose to stay home, away from the polls on November 4. But as for the rest of us, and I number myself among them, what were we to do? In the privacy of the voting booth, how were we to make our decision? </p> <p>I'm sure you'll recall the chaos of election night, as poll workers across the nation counted by hand the tens of millions of write-in candidates whose names marked our ballots. It was several weeks before every vote was recorded and the tabulations checked and rechecked. </p> <p>As the whole world now knows, the winner, by some 10,000 ballots, was America's most beloved movie personality, Tom Hanks. Mr Hanks is neither a radical black Christian Muslim terrorist nor a near-dead senile ultra-conservative, but a patriot.

We had, my wife and I, stayed up too late, watching returns and taking in all the commentary, even though we vowed before turning on the television, no commentary tonight, we're just going to tune in periodically, then we'll do something else, read or maybe watch a movie. We were interested in the results, in the actual numbers, but during the months leading up to the election, we consumed our fill of comment and interpretation and what passes for analysis and then declared moratoriums on the sorry lot - The News Hour, Election Center, Ballot Bowl, the best political team on television, if they did say so themselves. We twisted the coverage shut like a tap. What need did we have for additional information? We were not, after all, undecided. Our pronouncements, however, lacked teeth, and will power. So there we were, on the sofa, facing the commentators, listening, weighing, smirking. Wolf Blitzer advised that the only way to watch was with a laptop at one's side.

It was a name I imagined he liked the sound of. I said the name once more, elongating the syllables this time, enunciating. He, too, had seen some of the coverage, looking up from his blanket as the candidates delivered snippets of speeches. I had explained it to him, who was who and what they were about. I laid it all out, not in baby talk but in complete sentences spoken sweetly and with a little silliness. I try to talk to Elliot in sentences, I guess, so he hears whole thoughts.

  "<p>\"Forgotten but not gone\" was the way in which the supremo of Boston politics, Billy Bulger, liked to dismiss the human irritants he had crushed beneath his trim boot. The same could now be said for the hapless 43rd President of the United States as the daylight draws mercifully in on his reign of misfortune and calamity. How is he bearing up, one wonders, as the candidate from his own party treats him as the carrier of some sort of infectious political disease? How telling was it that the most impassioned moment in John McCain's performance in the final debate was when he declared: \"I am not George Bush.\"</p> <p>Where, O where are you, Dubya, as the action passes you by like a jet skirting dirty weather? Are you roaming the lonely corridors of the White House in search of a friendly shoulder around which to clap your affable arm? Are you sweating it out on the treadmill, hurt and confused as to why the man everyone wanted to have a beer (or Coke) with, who swept to re-election four years ago, has been downgraded to all-time loser in presidential history, stuck there in the bush leagues along with the likes of James Buchanan and Warren Harding? Or are you whacking brush in Crawford, where the locals now make a point of telling visitors that George W never really was from hereabouts anyroad.</p> <p>Whatever else his legacy, the man who called himself \"the decider\" has left some gripping history. The last eight years have been so rich in epic imperial hubris that it would take a reborn Gibbon to do justice to the fall. It should be said right away that amid the landscape of smoking craters there are one or two sprigs of decency that have been planted: record amounts of financial help given to Aids-blighted countries of Africa; immigration reform that would have offered an amnesty to illegals and given them a secure path to citizenship, had not those efforts hit the reef of intransigence in Bush's own party. And no one can argue with the fact that since 9/11 the United States has not been attacked on its home territory by jihadi terrorists; though whether or not that security is more illusory than real is, to put it mildly, open to debate. </p> <p>Bet against that there is the matter of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilian casualties, more than 4,000 American troops dead, many times that gravely injured, not to mention the puncture wounds and mutilations inflicted on internationally agreed standards of humane conduct for prisoners - and on the protection of domestic liberties enshrined in the American constitution. If the Statue of Liberty were alive, she would be weeping tears of blood.</p> <p>If Bush himself has been largely kept out of sight, his baleful legacy has been visible in the McCain campaign. McCain has made much of his credentials for independence of mind, a claim which once was credible given his support for immigration reform and opposition to Bush's tax cuts. But somewhere along the road to the Republican nomination, all of this became less important than the lessons of the Reagan-Bush-Rove political playbook which, with the exception of the Clinton election of 1992, seemed to have a track record of unbroken success. </p> <p>McCain knew this from bitter personal experience, having been on the receiving end of Bush lowball politics in the South Carolina primary in 2000. Coming out of a convincing win against George Bush in New Hampshire he was stopped in his tracks by a smear campaign conducted through push-poll phone calls in which people were asked whether they knew that the daughter McCain had adopted from Sri Lanka was in fact the illegitimate child of an affair with a woman of colour. Now you would think McCain could never reconcile himself to a politician capable of those kinds of tactics. But there he was in the campaign of 2004, stumping the country for the incumbent, ingratiating himself with the conservative base he knew he would need, even as his old Vietnam buddy, John Kerry, was being coated in slime by the Swift Boaters. </p> <p>Whatever misgivings McCain might have had about adopting the hardball tactics of his 2000 adversary have long since disappeared before the blandishments of classic Bush-style operatives like Rick Davis and Stephen Schmidt. \"Do you want to be pure, or do you want to win\"? they must have asked right after the nomination. Ditching Joe Lieberman as a running mate and unleashing pitbull Palin was his answer. </p> <p>So even while George Bush is kept at arm's length from the campaign, his campaign style lives on as Obama is stigmatised as a terrorist-friendly stealth-socialist, too deeply unAmerican to be let anywhere near the Oval Office. \"He just doesn't see America as we do\" says Sarah Palin trying to wink her way into Dick Cheney's seat. McCain is betting the house that this way of doing politics has at least one more hurrah left in it, and we will find out on in the early hours of Wednesday morning whether he is right.</p> <p>The Bush presidency is the spectre haunting the feast in more than tactics. Although every conservative administration since Ronald Reagan has promised to deliver, through supply-side stimulation, economic growth without bloated deficits, they have never been vindicated in their blind faith in what Bush senior once rashly called \"voodoo economics\". Consistently, they have brought the US Wall Street crashes and recessions along with massive deficits; and yet somehow, the stake that history attempts to drive through the heart of their economic theology never puts the ghoul away. </p> <p>No weight of evidence to the contrary has ever shaken the totemic belief that tax cuts can grow the economy robustly enough to compensate for drastic shortfalls in revenue. George W Bush clung to this belief even as the Clinton budget surplus was converted into a mountainous deficit, and John McCain continues to parrot the same belief with the shining face of a true believer. </p> <p>Not even Gibbon could supply a story as fatefully bizarre as the ultimate consummation of Reagan-Bush conservatism, its last act: the most massive shift of financial power from the private to the public sector since the New Deal. Rather like the Pope deciding that all along he really wanted a barmitzvah. </p> <p>If you look at this saga as the history of a dynasty; it's come full circle. For, believe it or not, there once was a time when Bush politics was about centrist moderation. Dubya's revered granddad, Prescott Sheldon Bush, son of an Ohio railroad executive and senator for Connecticut from 1952 to 1963, was punished in the Catholic towns of industrial Connecticut for his connection with Planned Parenthood. Not only that, but he was a trustee of the United Negro College Fund, the kind of institution that made the eventual career of Barack Obama conceivable. </p> <p>But the Bushes have always been selective about idealism. And even at the height of the Kennedy-Johnson apogee, Prescott and George Herbert Walker Bush were turning the pages of Barry Goldwater's Conscience of a Conservative. They could smell the wind direction changing. The future of Republican money and Republican power lay elsewhere; with Texas oil. Hence the migration to Midland Texas of George Herbert Walker Bush and his makeover into a Texan who knew the ways of the corporate world; and how to bring about the Great Cosiness between government and business that seemed like the perfect feedback loop: money to power, power to money; tax breaks for the corporations; donations to those who might command the heights.</p> <p>This is the politics George W Bush inherited, and he has been its faithful disciple; to the point of purging it of any remaining traces of pragmatism. It is astounding to hear rightwing talkshow bloviators rant about the predicament of the Bush administration being caused by its failure to carry out the true conservative agenda. For there never has been and never will be a more doctrinally faithful instrument of the creed. Never mind the hanging chads of 2000, the Cheney-Bush administration seized the moment to bring on the Goldwater-Reagan Rapture in which government was once and for all got out of the way of business.</p> <p>So it hasn't really been all George Bush's fault, the stupendous American fiasco. He came to power armed with an ideology that was about to crash and burn; that was, years before the present tumult, already fatally disconnected from historical reality. It was on his watch that American government needed reinventing. It was responsible government that was needed in Iraq and Afghanistan; government that was desperately needed in New Orleans after Katrina, while all George Bush could manage was a fly-by. It is government that this most anti-governmental of all American administrations is learning that is needed now to save the United States from a second Depression. </p> <p>In his heart of hearts I actually think the shell-shocked Dubya, somewhere in the bowels of his presidency knows this. But he is nowhere to be found, and so on goes the mad rant that health care reform and progressive taxes are the Trojan horse for socialist revolution. To which those who have another view altogether might want to say, fear not, for yours, as a Republican president once said, is a government of the people, by the people. And really it will not perish from the earth.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-339263795\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>Barack Obama entered the final hours of the longest and most expensive election campaign in American history in an upbeat mood yesterday, voicing confidence that the Democrats have a \"righteous wind at our back\".</p> <p>Obama's campaign team predicted that he would break the pattern of US politics to take long-established Republican states. The RealClearPolitics average put him on 50% to John McCain's 43%, a lead that, if replicated in tomorrow's election, would produce a landslide victory.</p> <p>The McCain camp came out in force too to argue that the Republican was still in contention and that it would be a mistake to write him off. \"What we are in for is a slam-bang finish,\" McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, predicted.</p> <p>Nearly two years after it began, the closing hours of the epic battle for the White House saw both camps making an exhaustive effort to win over the diminishing camp of undecided voters and get the faithful to the polls.</p> <p>In a swing through Ohio yesterday, Obama returned to the promise of a new kind of politics that has defined his campaign. \"It won't be easy, it won't be quick, but you and I know it's time to come together and change this country,\" he told a rally in Columbus. \"We can't let this slip away.\"</p> <p>McCain, meanwhile, pleaded with voters to ignore polls showing Obama ahead. \"My friends, I've been in a lot of campaigns, I know when momentum is there,\" he told a crowd in Wallingford, Pennsylvania. \"We're going to win. I sense it and I feel it and I know it.\"</p> <p>After defeat in the 2000 and 2004 elections, the Democrats, buoyed by poll numbers, were increasingly prepared to abandon the nervous hesitation about voicing in public their hopes that they were finally on the verge of victory. The Democratic senator Chuck Schumer told CBS television: \"Wednesday morning, Dems are going to be very happy.\"</p> <p>David Axelrod, Obama's chief strategist, was also optimistic, telling CBS he was cheered by the surge in early voting which favoured Democrats. \"The edge is pretty substantial in our favour,\" he said.</p> <p>By Saturday night, some 27 million Americans had already cast their ballots, making it increasingly difficult for McCain to catch up tomorrow.</p> <p>In Colorado, a once-Republican state where Obama now leads, 46% of the electorate turned out for early voting. North Carolina, an even more strongly Republican state, also showed heavy early voting in favour of the Democrat. In south Florida, which is heavily Democratic, the waiting time for early voting was as long as six hours.</p> <p>\"We feel good,\" Axelrod said. \"It is not just the polls. It is the early voting ... These figures are coming in strong for us, reversing the traditional patterns.\"</p> <p>The Republicans, while admitting the odds were stacked against them, insisted that McCain could close the gap. \"John's a closer. He always has been,\" Fred Thompson, the Law and Order star and a former rival for the White House, told NBC. \"He often is given up for dead - literally and politically. People have been wrong about him before.\"</p> <p>A poll yesterday by the Pew Research Centre did show some slippage in Obama's lead over McCain, but the Democrat was still ahead by 49% to 42%. None of the more than 250 polls conducted since September 25 has put McCain in the lead.</p> <p>The frantic closing hours saw Republicans in Pennsylvania breaking a promise by McCain not to make an issue of race, with an ad using clips from a now infamous sermon of Obama's former pastor, the Rev Jeremiah Wright, in which he thunders: \"God damn America!\"</p> <p>McCain has \"a very steep hill to climb\", Karl Rove, the mastermind of George Bush's election victories, told Fox.</p> <p>Republicans also paid for robocalls - taped telephone messages - quoting Hillary Clinton from when she stood against Obama for the Democratic nomination, saying he was inexperienced and the White House was no place for \"on the job training\".</p> <p>McCain's team, which has been outspent in advertising by Obama almost every day since the campaign formally began early in September, said in an email to supporters yesterday that it would match him on the eve of election. \"In the final days of the campaign, our television presence will be bigger and broader than the Obama campaign's presence.\" The McCain camp said it would outspend Obama by $10m (\u00a36m) in the coming hours.</p> <p>McCain devoted most of his final hours trying to shore up support in Republican states. Aside from yesterday's stop in Pennsylvania, his itinerary called for trips to Florida, Ohio, Missouri, and even Tennessee, with a swing through the Rocky mountain states of Nevada, Colorado and New Mexico before returning to his home in Arizona tonight.</p> <p>Obama, who was in Ohio yesterday with Bruce Springsteen, will campaign exclusively in Republican territory today.</p>",
  "<p>With one day left until the nation goes to vote, the US is awash with numbers. Statistics and polls spout from every television bulletin, newspaper and website. To call it confusing is an understatement.</p> <p>That's where Nate Silver steps in. The 30-year-old from Chicago is the brains behind <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com\">FiveThirtyEight.com</a>, a website that has become the go-to destination for anyone trying to make sense of the statistics. Each day he crunches dozens of polls - he estimates that 24 are \"reasonably active\", including eight daily national tracking polls - to work out which one is the most accurate.</p> <p>\"There are several objectives,\" he says. \"The first is to make pollsters more accountable. Likewise, I think the way polls are reported in the media - well, there's too much coverage. It's good for me, but I think there are more sophisticated and interesting things going on.\" On Friday the FiveThirtyEight model showed a 95% chance of an Obama victory, and a 36% chance of a landslide.</p> <p>A thin, bespectacled man with the look of a postgraduate, Silver has a track record with numbers: he made his name in 2003 with a new method of forecasting baseball players' performances. He points out that sport and politics have their similarities. \"In baseball you have statistics recited constantly, 10-a-minute, but they're not necessarily telling you what it all means. The fundamental question we're trying to answer is: what makes a baseball team win? It's the same approach in politics - what makes a good campaign, a good electoral strategy?\"</p> <p>The success of FiveThirtyEight (the number of electoral votes up for grabs in a general election) has led to some weird and wonderful opportunities (being asked to meet the French ambassador, Silver says, was among the stranger ones). The torrent of activity is made easier since he works out of his two-bedroom apartment, but the rush hasn't left much time for a personal life. \"Over the past couple of weeks it's been waking up to a couple of voicemails and 100 emails. It's pretty overwhelming now.\"</p>",
  "<p>Whether it's front runner Barack Obama or outsider John McCain who makes it to the White House when America goes to the polls tomorrow, the first briefing the new president gets on the economy from the US treasury and the Federal Reserve will be a sombre affair. Rarely, if ever, in the postwar period has a new chief executive faced a more challenging baptism.</p> <p>On the plus side, circumstances do not look quite so bleak as they did a month ago, when there was justifiable concern that the entire global financial system was on the point of collapse. One positive result from the mayhem that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers was that it forced policymakers around the world to act quickly, decisively and collectively to halt the slide into the abyss.</p> <p>Japan's decision last week to force down the value of the yen was partly driven by the need to help the big exporters on whom the economy relies, but it was also intended to boost capital flows into the US through the sale of yen for dollars. That was one reason Wall Street rallied so strongly.</p> <p>Policy action has not been confined to recapitalising the banks and injecting large dollops of cheap money into financial markets in the hope that it will persuade banks to start lending to one another once again.</p> <p>Monetary policy is being eased everywhere, with the expectation that the Fed will join Japan in having a policy rate below 1% by the end of the year. Rates in the UK are also set to tumble: Roger Bootle at Capital Economics believes they could be cut to 1% in 2009 as the Bank of England tries to jump-start the economy. Rates have never been lower than 2% in the postwar era.</p> <h2>Deepest recession</h2> <p>Central banks will be able to use easing inflationary pressure to justify these rock-bottom interest rates. Oil prices are less than half their peak of early July, and other commodity prices are also down sharply as global demand weakens. The new US president will be hoping that the boost to real incomes from cheaper gasoline prices provides a boost to confidence and spending.</p> <p>That, though, is just about the extent of the good news. The bad news for Obama or McCain is that the US and the other members of the G7 industrialised nations face the deepest recession since the 1930s; that the crisis has not gone away, merely been pushed - perhaps temporarily - from the core of the system to the emerging markets; and that the dominant financial model of the past decade and more is bust.</p> <p>Part of the problem, as Stephen Lewis of Monument Securities has noted, is that it has taken far too long for policymakers to understand that they cannot shove the genie back into the bottle, and as a result the downturn in prospect for 2009 and 2010 will be much deeper than it ought to have been.</p> <p>\"If the G7 had recognised at an early stage, say a year ago, that the financial capitalism model was irretrievably broken, they might have managed the transition to a new economic model at less cost than they have subsequently incurred,\" Lewis says. \"They might have dissolved the investment banks and the toxic products they had created before a negative feedback loop from the economy to the financial sector was established.\"</p> <p>That \"negative feedback loop\" works as follows. The financial sector goes haywire during the boom years, developing business models that work only in the good times. As the Bank of England noted in last week's financial stability report, the British banking system was lending \u00a3750bn more than it was taking in deposits, covering the gap by raising money in the wholesale markets and betting that the good times would go on for ever. When the bust arrives, the model collapses and the financial sector retrenches. It severely rations credit, with the result that house prices fall, businesses go bust and people lose their jobs. The losses of the financial sector mount, leaving them short of capital and even more unwilling to lend.</p> <p>Everything that policymakers have done over the past month - from nationalisation of banks to cuts in interest rates - has been designed to break this vicious circle. Their efforts have worked to the extent that money market rates have started to fall, but this is a skirmish in a much longer war.</p> <p>In the US, for example, the official interest rate has come down from 5.25% in the summer to 1%, yet mortgage rates have not fallen as much. The 30-year home loan rate has declined by a little over half a percentage point, a tiny reduction in the context of the biggest housing boom-bust in American history. Mortgage rates at their current levels mean the real estate market will remain in crisis, with knock-on effects for all those under-performing mortgage-backed securities held by the banks.</p> <h2>Crowding out</h2> <p>Policymakers also need to be aware of the dangers of what economists term \"crowding out\". This is where a big increase in borrowing by governments makes it more expensive for the private sector to obtain funds. In the context of a global economy, there is the added dimension of sovereign \"crowding out\", whereby the need to bolster the countries at the core of the global financial system leads to a dearth of funds for weaker countries. There is evidence of both these phenomena: upward pressure on non-investment corporate bond yields and in the problems faced by Iceland, Hungary, Ukraine and other emerging economies.</p> <p>Equally, the fall in the cost of crude may be good news for western consumers but it is not so hot for the oil-exporting countries, many of which are hardly models of stable democracies. A further halving of the oil price to about $30 a barrel could quite easily lead to severe political unrest, perhaps even revolution, resulting in restrictions in supply and a surge in crude prices to the peak levels reached earlier this year.</p> <p>The message for Obama or McCain is simple. Things have moved on apace even from where they were in the summer when only one of the 17 agenda items for the new president listed by the Associated Press mentioned the credit crisis. So far, America's downturn has been shallow, but the squeeze on consumer incomes and the deteriorating labour markets mean there is worse to come. The US will be in recession in 2009, as will the eurozone, Japan and Britain, and for the G7 as a whole this is likely to be the worst downturn since the second world war. The big developing countries, China in particular, cannot be immune from the problems in the west; given the export-dominated nature of these economies it was always fanciful to suppose that they could decouple themselves.</p> <p>All of which suggests that the new president faces an economic challenge as testing as any since Roosevelt arrived in the White House in 1933. The good news is that even using the most pessimistic assumptions it is hard to see a peak-to-trough decline in US GDP of anything like the sort suffered in the Great Depression, when the economy contracted by 25%.</p> <p>The bad news for tomorrow's victor is that FDR arrived after the worst of the slump was over, rather than just as it began. Even if everything goes according to plan and there are no policy errors, America will still have a recession every bit as costly as those in the 1970s and 1980s. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Emotions run hot on election eve, and few emotions are more a-boil right now than liberal paranoia. I hear it constantly: I don't care about the polls. I won't believe it until I see it. The Republicans stole 2000 and 2004, and they'll steal this one.</p> <p>This dark pessimism is fortified by a corollary anxiety that each new revelation about Barack Obama will surely bring the whole enterprise crashing down and make middle Americans wake up and say to themselves, \"Of course. What was I thinking? Back to McCain!\" </p> <p>This past weekend it was the story about Obama's auntie in Boston, a woman living in the US illegally for the last four years. But Zeituni Onyango is fading into the background, just another element of the farrago of last-minute titbits that make for future trivia questions. Her name may have been unlawfully leaked to the press by officials seeking to do Obama damage. But whatever the truth of that matter, the injury to Obama would appear to be minimal.</p> <p>And yet, some liberals feared that this revelation would be the death knell. But in their terror, they have probably not stopped to ask themselves: if Bill Ayers and Jeremiah Wright and Rashid Khalidi - the Palestinian rights advocate with whom Obama is friendly and whom McCain smeared last week - didn't blow up this campaign, why would Onyango?</p> <p>Face it, liberal paranoiacs: the swift-boating of Barack Obama clearly is not working. That it would work - indeed that it would define the contest - was the greatest fear of liberals everywhere as it became clear last spring that this somewhat unusual creature would carry the Democratic standard into battle this autumn. Many foresaw an October full of racial innuendo, Obama-Osama Freudian slips and worse. </p> <p>Sure enough, we did see a lot of it. John McCain and Sarah Palin worked overtime to try to persuade Americans that Obama shared Ayers's radical world view. McCain's disgraceful comparison of Khalidi to a \"neo-Nazi\" - this about an American citizen by birth who teaches at an Ivy League university and has no record of extremism beyond that which can be conjured on rightwing websites on the basis of the odd out of context quote - was perhaps the lowest point of his whole campaign. And the Republicans have used race in subtle ways - the argument that Obama would take people's hard-earned tax dollars and hand them to idlers on \"welfare\" is a very old racist trope in the US.</p> <p>Here in the 11th hour, we are hearing that Obama is unpatriotic and a friend to criminals; that he's not really a citizen of the US (disproved over the weekend by birth registrars in the state of Hawaii); and that his election will lead to a second Holocaust.</p> <p>Yes, the voting is still a day away. But so far none of it has amounted to a single point in the polls that I can see, except perhaps in some southern states where tradition dies hard. Why? Three reasons. </p> <p>First, the Obama team has responded quickly whenever such allegations have arisen. John Kerry's advisers let a fateful 15 days of swift-boating pass before they even addressed the issue. Obama's people haven't made that mistake. They've answered all charges and usually turned around and levelled a few charges of their own.</p> <p>Second, the economic crisis really has fixed many voters' minds on more germane questions. Voters are more susceptible to character attacks when times are good and they don't have real bread-and-butter issues to worry about. But when times are tough, they actually do listen a little harder to discern which candidate seems to be more serious about addressing their problems.</p> <p>The third reason is historical and is just my theory, but I think it's right. Broadly speaking, the American electorate consists of three chunks: committed conservatives, committed liberals and the uncommitted swing voters in the middle. When Ronald Reagan realigned American politics in 1980, he did so by forging a strong emotional alliance between the right and the middle. Centrist voters gave Republicans and conservatives the benefit of the doubt and looked upon Democrats and liberals, whom Reagan successfully discredited, with deep suspicion.</p> <p>In that context, charges that Democrats weren't good Americans tended to stick. Whether it was Michael Dukakis's membership in the American Civil Liberties Union in 1988 or Kerry and the swift-boaters last time around, conservative allegations that Democrats seem alien and elitist and not fully American took hold with voters in the middle. They accepted terms of argument set by the Republicans.</p> <p>But post-George Bush we're in a new context. That coalition of affinity that Reagan created between right and middle, Bush has put asunder. His failures have made the average, apolitical American as distrustful of conservatism as he or she once was of liberalism - indeed somewhat more so, since the memory of conservative failure is fresher in the mind. This is a new context. Many experts have yet to grasp it. Certain elements within the mainstream media haven't quite got it yet. And clearly some liberals just can't believe that it might be the case.</p> <p>This is not to say that negative campaigning will disappear as of tomorrow. But it is to observe that political contexts change, and eras end. I'm still suspicious enough to use the conditional tense, but by Wednesday morning even the most paranoid liberals may be forced to accept that fact.</p> <p>\u2022 Michael Tomasky is the editor of Guardian America.

  "<p>Electioneering has reached its peak in the lead up to New Zealand's general election this week. But for the country's university bosses, the campaign might as well be over.</p> <p>Despite lobbying strongly on the need for an urgent and significant boost to their funding, universities have lost the battle for political attention to their students.</p> <p>Though some parties have vaguely promised funding increases to universities, most have pledged even bigger increases for student financial support. Those pledges include abolition of tuition fees and introduction of student loan write-offs.</p> <p>But the show-stopper has been the ruling Labour party's decision to introduce universal student allowances from 2012 if it is re-elected. Current allowances are available to all students over the age of 24 and to younger students only if their parents earn less than NZ$45,743 a year (\u00a316,453). </p> <p>Though the Green and New Zealand First parties already had universal allowance policies, they could not realistically be achieved without the support of either of New Zealand's major parties \u2013 Labour or National. </p> <p>Though Labour has now joined them, National has refused \u2013 although it has promised improved student loan repayment conditions. </p> <p>For vice-chancellors, perhaps, the most galling aspect of Labour's policy is its estimated cost \u2013 at NZ$210m it is just shy of the NZ$230m they say they urgently need to restore their funding to early 1990s levels and make them competitive with their international peers.</p> <p>From their point of view, the situation is made worse by the fact that New Zealand already spends 42% of its government funding for tertiary education on student financial support, one of the highest proportions in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).</p> <p>The allowance policy is Labour's second consecutive attempt to win votes with a student-focused pledge: in the 2005 election it narrowly triumphed after a surprise announcement that it would abolish interest on the government's student loans.</p> <p>Though Labour insists it has long held a policy of returning to universal allowances, which were available until the early 1990s, the major newspapers criticised this year's policy announcement as a pre-election bribe.</p> <p>Bribe or not, current polling indicates Labour will not win sufficient votes to return to power. Instead, the centre-right National party is likely to form a government with one or more coalition partners. </p> <p>That will be cold comfort for vice-chancellors. Barring a late and surprise announcement from the Nationals, universities have again learned their funding is simply not a vote-winner.</p> <p>But Prof Stuart McCutcheon, vice-chancellor of New Zealand's largest university, the University of Auckland, believes that might be changing. </p> <p>McCutcheon notes that when the major newspapers dismissed Labour's universal allowance policy, they mentioned the importance of adequate funding for tertiary institutions.</p> <p>\"People are beginning to understand that endlessly increasing support for students in order to attract votes is not an appropriate strategy when it is clear we are putting the future of universities and their ability to compete internationally at risk,\" he says.<br> Prof Pat Walsh, vice-chancellor of Victoria University of Wellington, recently warned that this risk was more pressing than many realise. Walsh says New Zealand's universities could be at a tipping point in their efforts to maintain quality despite under-funding. Efforts to ensure tertiary study was affordable for students could only go so far.</p> <p>\"If the pendulum swings too far toward affordability, students will be able to come to university but the quality will be compromised and this will be to no-one's benefit,\" he says.</p> <p>Lincoln University vice-chancellor and chair of the New Zealand Vice-Chancellors' Committee, Roger Field, says New Zealand has one of the highest entry rates to degree-level education in the OECD and its student financial support is generous by international standards.</p> <p>\"Which,\" he says, \"suggests that the tertiary education policy emphasis needs to shift\". </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>John Gerritsen is New Zealand correspondent for University World News</p>"
