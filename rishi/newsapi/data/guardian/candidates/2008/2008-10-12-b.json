  "<p>'Have a cannoli,\" says Cyndi Lauper, pushing a bakery box across the coffee table. She's about to eat one of the cheese-filled, ruinously calorific Italian pastries. \"Here, eat it from the box - you never know who's been on the table.\" </p> <p>It's hard to imagine Madonna making such a gesture, let alone watching approvingly as the cannoli is swallowed. It may be unfair to still be comparing Lauper to Madonna 25 years after the pop rivalry that resulted in the arguably more talented Lauper being relegated to runner-up, but the similarities make it hard to avoid. Both are Italian-American Catholics whose personalities engulf their music; both are in their third decade in a business that often measures a career in months; and both have influenced subsequent generations of singers. Gwen Stefani and Alison Goldfrapp certainly seem to have taken Lauper's full-colour kookiness as their model.</p> <p>There is also a new point of comparison: Lauper's first album of new material since 1997, Bring Ya to the Brink, is a back-to-the-disco record that has things in common (including the use of hip young producers) with Madonna's recent return to her early 1980s sound. The difference is that the crackling Bring Ya to the Brink sounds like it was made not with platinum discs in mind but to sate Lauper's massive appetite for musical experimentation. That's just as well; its first single, Into the Nightlife, sold well, but the album, despite thrilling the critics, hasn't had the same success. Is she bothered? Well, one of her favourite expressions is \"I don't give a hoot!\", and she does seem to mean it.</p> <p>\"David and Declyn,\" she says, referring to her husband and son, \"have said to me that they wish I had Madonna's business sense. I don't have good business sense. You never get much money for the arts. But I like independence. I like to grow.\" As an artist - a word she much prefers to singer, since she's also a producer, video director, occasional actor and organiser of True Colors, a multi-band outfit that travels America with a human-rights message - she's grown significantly since her 1984 signature hit, Girls Just Want to Have Fun. Although she was never again so in tune with the zeitgeist as she was then, dressed in those thrift-shop petticoats and urging girls to fight for their right to party, she has done far more interesting things since. </p> <p>There have been, among her 12 albums, a bravely sparse acoustic adventure, a covers set that reinvented standards such as Walk On By, a self-written Christmas collection and now this new disco record, which was co-produced by youths so screamingly hip they don't mind being known as The Scumfrog and Digital Dog. (The better-known Basement Jaxx also figure.) \"My music is about a joyful experience,\" she says. \"I've learned that if you can affect other people, you should. I'm not gonna worry about what people think about me. I'm too busy. I don't give a hoot.\"</p> <p>There's a lullaby sweetness to her speaking voice that contrasts markedly with both her powerhouse singing style and the New York accent that coats every word. Years ago, as a guest on Terry Wogan's TV show, she was ribbed by Wogan about the accent and, supremely straight-faced, told him: \"Most people think I'm cockney.\" It transpires that she was being serious. \"People do say I sound English sometimes,\" she says. \"At home, sometimes they say that.\" Home is still New York, where they clearly have a novel perception of the English accent. </p> <p>But maybe I've misunderstood: Lauper's thoughts aren't always easy to follow, sometimes emerging as a stream of images that don't bear much relation to the question she's meant to be answering. Asked how she'd hooked up with Basement Jaxx, who co-wrote the album's fabulously spaced-out track Rocking Chair, she instead tells a story about taking the Eurostar to London from Paris. \"The train goes under the water, so you don't see the white cliffs of Dover! When we went through the tunnel, I was sitting there, quietly singing The White Cliffs of Dover to myself.\" She then describes what she'd been wearing on the train - lots of enveloping layers and a fedora - and then sighs, saying: \"When you're young and walk down the street and look eccentric, that's cute. But when you're older, they're scared of you. Get to the other side of the street! The difference between the way you look and the way you think you look! I thought I looked like Greta Garbo.\"</p> <p>There's nothing eccentric about her appearance today. She's downright glamorous: stylishly angular platinum hair, black jeans, black sweater and fierce, high-heeled black boots. She looks years younger than 55, and is very pleased when I say so. \"Ageism? There's ageism in everything. I don't give a hoot. It isn't what other people think; it's what you think. But it's hard to come to terms with getting older. I admire people like Vivienne Westwood.\" And Madonna? \"She's fantastic. She's like Wonder Woman.\"</p> <p>She's keen to discuss Bring Ya to the Brink, written and recorded in Europe. \"I wanted to experience writing in a different place. I never went to Europe to write before. I didn't go as a famous person, I went as a writer and stayed at a hole-in-the-wall hotel in Chelsea, and I could come and go without being noticed. I went to Brixton [to work with Basement Jaxx] and that was so great.\" </p> <p>Despite having sold around 25m records - including one, Girls Just Want to Have Fun, that's considered the definitive pop moment of its year, if not the early 1980s - Lauper doesn't relish the limelight, and worries about its effect on Declyn, 10. \"He was two when he first realised I was famous,\" she says. \"It's hard for him. People look at him, and he feels the pressure of being my son. Someone came up to me in the street and kept talking and talking. Declyn said afterwards, 'Who are you?' And I said, 'I'm a mommy.' And he said, 'No, you're not - you're Cyndi Lauper!'\" She searches through her handbag and pulls out photos of a long-haired little boy wearing a hockey mask. She laughs: \"I'm a hockey mom.\"</p> <p>This leads to a brief discussion of the moment's other renowned hockey mom, Sarah Palin, for whom Lauper has mixed feelings: \"She gives a good soundbite. It's great McCain picked a woman, but it's sad he picked one who's unqualified.\" On her blog, she has reproduced an essay by Gloria Steinem, the US feminist icon, that rues the choice of Palin, and the site provides a link to register to vote. On her True Colors tour this summer, she banged home this same message, telling audiences: \"It's more important to vote for the American president than the American Idol.\"</p> <p>You don't do a bad soundbite yourself, I say. She looks dubious, as if I've insulted her, then decides no offence was intended. She's a sensitive person, she says, who's always felt herself an outsider, \"and not through choice. I've always been the outsider looking in.\" So the title of her multi-platinum 1983 debut album, She's So Unusual, was apt? \"It wasn't a joke,\" she says.</p> <p>The back cover of Bring Ya to the Brink shows Lauper standing outside a suburban house, gazing into a window. This photo, inspired by a painting she did while studying art as a teenager in Vermont, has only one interpretation: exclusion. Despite the professional success, the 17-year marriage to Law &amp; Order actor David Thornton, and the warm reviews that greeted Bring Ya to the Brink, she still sees herself as the odd one out. Not that she's bothered. </p> <p>\"Do people know who I really am, what I really do?\" she says. \"No. Do I care? No\".</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Cyndi Lauper </strong>plays Shepherds Bush Empire, London W1 (0870 771 2000), tomorrow. Then touring. <strong>Bring Ya to the Brink</strong> is out now</p>",
  "<h2>Merchants shut shops in protest over sales tax</h2> <p>Merchants in Tehran's main market shut their shops yesterday in protest at a new 3% sales tax, despite the government promising to suspend it for two months. Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, ordered the levy to be suspended for two months last Thursday, a day after a rare strike by merchants against the measure. A series of merchant strikes helped lead to the 1979 Islamic revolution that toppled the shah. Ahmadinejad faces a re-election battle next year and yesterday a first challenger emerged in the form of Mehdi Karroubi, a reformist, cleric and former speaker of parliament. <br><strong>Associated Press, Tehran</strong></p> <h2>Vote includes referendum on old nuclear plant</h2> <p>Two populist parties appeared poised for a strong showing yesterday in parliamentary elections that could usher in a governing coalition aligned more closely with Russia than Europe. The vote also features a referendum on whether to keep a flawed, Soviet-era nuclear plant operating beyond its scheduled closure. The Chernobyl-style reactor's design flaws concerns EU members, who insist that it be closed in December 2009. Many Lithuanians claim that shutting down the Ignalina plant, which gives them energy independence, will leave them vulnerable to Russia, an unreliable energy supplier. <br><strong>Associated Press, Vilnius </strong></p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338551060\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1854840559_gdn-int-081013-cb-Zimbabwe-Tsvangirai-4x3.flv\"/> </video>   <p>Zimbabwe's opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, yesterday threatened to pull out of a power-sharing deal after President Robert Mugabe unilaterally announced that the ruling Zanu-PF party would control all main cabinet posts, including the military and police.</p> <p>South Africa's former president, Thabo Mbeki, is expected in Harare today to try and rescue the deal he brokered, under which Tsvangirai would be appointed prime minister and Mugabe would remain president but with far fewer powers. </p> <p>Tsvangirai told a rally in Harare yesterday that he would not be pressured by Mugabe into joining an administration dominated by Zanu-PF, when the opposition Movement for Democratic Change won the last reputable elections in March. </p> <p>\"If they do it that way, we have no right to be part of such an arrangement,\" said Tsvangirai. \"The people have suffered. But if it means suffering the more in order for them to get what is at stake, then so be it. We will renegotiate until an agreement is reached, but that does not mean we will compromise for the sake of it.\"</p> <p>Mugabe gazetted the appointment of new cabinet posts at the weekend, allocating his party control over the various security and intelligence forces as well as the justice portfolio and the information ministry, which controls Zimbabwe's highly partisan state newspapers and broadcasters.</p> <p>The MDC described the move as a \"giant act of madness which puts the whole deal into jeopardy\" and as a ploy to pre-empt Mbeki's visit to unblock the logjam over the distribution of ministries. \"The elite in Zanu-PF is not interested in addressing the current challenges in the country. Instead, they are obsessed with power retention at all costs,\" Tsvangirai's party said.</p> <p>The MDC says it will agree to Zanu-PF having authority over the military, but that Tsvangirai must control home affairs, which oversees the police, and the justice ministry. That is important to Tsvangirai to ensure that Zanu-PF does not repeat its violent campaign at the next election.</p> <p>Mugabe's move is a demonstration of his power to obstruct the political deal he described as \"humiliating\" after he was forced to sign it last month. But his position remains weak. There will be no foreign aid to rescue an economy collapsing under hyperinflation - officially put at 231 million percent, but which in reality runs into the trillions - without Tsvangirai wielding real authority at the head of a genuine power-sharing government. </p> <p>Mugabe only signed the political agreement with the opposition because his administration had no solutions to the economic crisis. While he can block implementation of the deal and keep control of the government, he will be left facing even deeper problems than when he was forced into the agreement. </p> <p>Neither can Mugabe count on Mbeki to protect him. Although Mbeki remains the mediator, South Africa's new president, Kgalema Motlanthe, and those around him are hostile to Mugabe and there is a growing will inside the new government to confront Zimbabwe's leader.</p>",
  "<p>The US is to lose its power to appoint the president of the World Bank after the UK's development secretary, Douglas Alexander, brokered a deal to throw open the post to candidates from any country.</p> <p>Backed by European governments and developing countries, Alexander overcame resistance from the US and Japan to secure a reform he described last night as \"a significant step forward\".</p> <p>Washington has had the right to hand-pick the president of the World Bank since the institution was founded after the second world war, with Europe choosing the managing director of the International Monetary Fund.</p> <p>Alexander said: \"The agreement provides the opportunity for candidates to be nominated regardless of nationality. It will ensure that the best-qualified candidate is selected.\"</p> <p>Developing countries have grown increasingly frustrated at the stranglehold of rich nations on the two Washington-based multilateral bodies, with pressure for change accelerating after the controversial presidency of Paul Wolfowitz, who was forced to step down after a scandal involving his partner's promotion.</p> <p>Alexander said that more changes were needed: \"It is a significant step forward, albeit on a much longer journey.\"</p> <p>The bank's development committee yesterday was dominated by concerns that poor countries would fall victim to the global financial crisis. It backed proposals that will give countries from sub-Saharan Africa a third seat on its 25-strong governing board. </p> <p>The bank's president, Robert Zoellick, urged rich countries not to forget their pledges of financial support to the developing world. The bank believes the number of malnourished will increase by 44 million this year.</p> <p>Donor countries were also discussing whether to release a multibillion-dollar reconstruction package to Zimbabwe. Alexander said the tests a new Zimbabwean government would have to meet included respecting human rights and allowing charities into the country to deliver aid.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a> has bowed to a growing chorus of condemnation over his personal attacks in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselections2008\">election campaign</a>, which critics have claimed run the risk of unleashing the politics of the mob by inciting hatred among his increasingly volatile ranks.</p> <p>Faced with rising criticism of his negative tactics, McCain looks to have begun a rethink of his strategy. He notably toned down his rhetoric during a sweep through Minnesota, responding to one woman who called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Obama</a> an Arab: \"No, ma'am. No, ma'am. He is a decent family man, citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues.\"</p> <p>The most cutting criticism of the McCain camp's campaign came from John Lewis, a Democrat congressman from Atlanta, Georgia. He accused McCain and his running mate, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a>, of \"sowing the seeds of hatred and division\".</p> <p>Lewis likened the attacks made by the Republican candidates against their opponent, Barack Obama, to the climate of hate that was whipped up by George Wallace, a Democrat who held the governorship of Alabama intermittently over 30 years until 1982. He said, referring to a notorious episode in 1963: \"Because of [the] atmosphere of hate, four little girls were killed on a Sunday morning when a church was bombed in Birmingham, Alabama.\" </p> <p>To compare the tactics of McCain to Wallace, a segregationist, would have been piercing from any politician. Coming from Lewis, a lauded leader of the civil rights movement and close associate of Martin Luther King, who had his skull fractured by Alabama police in 1965, it was incendiary. </p> <p>McCain immediately hit back, saying the comparison with Wallace was \"shocking and beyond the pale\". Lewis insisted he had been seeking to remind Americans that \"toxic language can lead to destructive behaviour\". </p> <p>In a further sign that McCain has begun to rein in the attacks, at a recent town-hall event he responded to a man claiming he was scared of an Obama presidency by taking the microphone away and telling him that Obama was \"a decent person that you do not have to be scared of as president of the United States\".</p> <p>The remark was met with booing from the crowd, but later elicited a grateful response from Obama, who thanked his opponent for his \"reminder that we can disagree while still being respectful of each other\".</p> <p>The heated exchanges have focused attention on the high-risk decision by McCain to keep his flagging presidential hopes alive by resorting to negative tactics. Much of the sharpest attacks have come from Palin, who has demonstrated her self-designated skills as a political pitbull on several occasions. </p> <p>In one rally Palin accused Obama of \"palling around with terrorists\"; in another she said he was \"not a man who sees America the way you and I see America\". The comments have prompted individuals in the increasingly restless Republican crowds to shout, presumably in reference to Obama, \"Kill him!\" and \"Off with his head!\" Palin made no effort to rebut the hecklers, and it prompted the influential New York Times columnist Frank Rich to complain that \"to stay silent is to pour gas on the fires\".</p> <p>The criticism of the tone of the McCain campaign comes at an already difficult moment for the Republican presidential hopeful. National polls are showing an Obama lead of between six and 11 points, with several key swing states such as Pennsylvania and Virginia also leaning towards the Democratic candidate.</p> <p>With just three full weeks to go until polling day, McCain is now up against the clock in his struggle to find a message with voters that will stick. He has found it particularly difficult to hold a coherent line amid the raging financial crisis that is dominating the election debate.</p> <p>In recent days he has put forward a raft of financial interventions, including a $300bn (\u00a3176bn) plan to buy up bad mortgages with federal funds, on top of the $700bn bail-out devised by the Bush administration. But the proposals conflict with McCain's earlier stance in favour of reducing the scope of government - a campaigning posture designed to appeal to the base of his own Republican party.</p>",
  "<p>As the nation's attention keeps skipping from the financial meltdown to the presidential election and back again, nothing serves as a more apt metaphor for John McCain's campaign right now than the state of the markets and the popular response to it.</p> <p>People hold on, thinking it will bottom out, only to find it plumbing new and unexpected depths. Gripped by panic and fuelled by fear, those responsible for guiding it to a better place keep steering it into the ground. No one knows where it will all end, but it is already clear that it will end badly and that everyone will have to pay for it.</p> <p>The McCain campaign is in freefall. This time last month, fresh off the nomination of Sarah Palin and their convention, the Republican ticket held a two-point lead in national polls and was ahead in all the states that George Bush won in 2004 with the exceptions of New Mexico, Colorado and Iowa. McCain was also mounting a serious challenge in Michigan, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire - states that Democrat John Kerry won with slim margins in 2004. McCain was not in a strong position, but it was a viable one.</p> <p>Today he is trailing by an average of seven points nationally, has pulled out of Michigan and finds himself struggling in Virginia, North Carolina and Indiana - states where Republicans don't usually have to run seriously, let alone sweat. Meanwhile, he is now losing in Florida and Ohio - the totemic prizes of 2000 and 2004 respectively. On most present projections, McCain could win every remaining toss-up state and Obama would still take the White House by a huge margin. If the vote were held today and the polls were accurate, we would be witnessing a landslide.</p> <p>So if the McCain campaign seems desperate it's because it has every reason to be. It has a candidate - who thanks to his war record and foreign policy experience, would have been formidable in 2004 - being handled by Bush strategists who are working from a playbook of smear and innuendo that worked brilliantly in 2000 and 2004, and running on a tax-cutting manifesto that has barely been updated since the mid-80s. The result is a mixture of the demotic, the erratic and the irrelevant.</p> <p>\"I think you're seeing a turning point,\" says Saul Anuzis, the Republican chairman in Michigan. \"You're starting to feel real frustration because we are running out of time. Our message, the campaign's message, isn't connecting.\"</p> <p>If anything, the trouble is quite the opposite. Their message is connecting too well. Last week the plan was to change the message from fixing the economy to denigrating Obama's character. This task was left to Palin, who executed it faithfully and effectively.</p> <p>\"For me, the heels are on, the gloves are off,\" she told Republican donors in Florida. For the rest of the week she invoked Obama's association with Bill Ayers, the former 60s radical and founder of a domestic terror group, as though Obama had just emerged from the Tora Bora mountains with a \"Vote for Bin Laden\" sign under his arm. </p> <p>Obama, she claimed, has been \"palling around with terrorists and launched his political career in the living room of a domestic terrorist\". \"This is not a man who sees America the way you and I see America,\" she told one crowd. \"I'm afraid this is someone who sees America as imperfect enough to work with a former domestic terrorist who had targeted his own country,\" she told another. </p> <p>The truth is that Ayers, who is now a professor of education at the University of Illinois and a former aide to the Chicago mayor, Richard Daley, lives a few blocks from Obama, donated $200 to his re-election fund to the Illinois state senate in 2001, and sits with Obama on the eight-person board of the Woods Fund, which supports low-income and minority groups on the South Side of Chicago. </p> <p>But in post 9/11 America, where fear often works better than truth, Palin certainly connected with her audience. Her rallies have taken on the air of lynch mobs, with supporters yelling \"Kill him\", \"Terrorist\" and \"Treason\" at the mention of Obama's name. Meanwhile, local officials introducing McCain have been emphasising Obama's middle name, \"Hussein\".</p> <p>Given that Hillary Clinton was the first to raise the connection between Obama and Ayers during the primaries, it is difficult for the Democrats to now claim it is off limits. But the Republican base, which has been in a rage for some time, has taken it to a whole new level. For six years the party controlled all three branches of the government. They slashed taxes, started wars and ignored international agreements at their whim. Eight years on America is poorer, weaker, and more isolated and vulnerable than it has been in several generations. They look around for someone or something to blame. As their own president is poised to nationalise the banking system, they hear Obama's name and reflexively scream \"socialist\".</p> <p>On Friday McCain had to pull them back from the brink. One man said he was \"scared to bring up [his] child in a world where Barack Obama was president\". McCain replied: \"He is a decent person that you do not have to be scared of as president of the United States.\" The crowd booed. Later a woman said she could not trust Obama because he is an \"Arab\". McCain grabbed the microphone from her before she could go on. \"No ma'am, he's a decent family man, a citizen, who I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues.\" The crowd applauded. </p> <p>The trouble is that if Obama is the man they say he is, then the crowd has every reason to be scared - after all, what decent family man \"pals around with terrorists\"?</p> <p>Indeed, ordinarily these attacks and McCain's agenda would work. But not in the middle of a stockmarket crash. People are more concerned with keeping their jobs than with being taxed in them; more focused on economic security than on national security; and they care more about their retirement accounts and homes than they do about Ayers - whom most have never heard of. </p> <p>It's not that the barely veiled racial slights don't resonate with some. It's that when faced with the question: do you hate black people more than you like your house, your job or your retirement account, for many the hurdle of racism does not seem quite so high.</p> <p>Nonetheless there are a few reasons why Obama should not be complacent. First of all, the election is not today. What has turned around in a month can turn back again. After the final debate in 2000 Al Gore was leading Bush by 11%; we all know how that turned out. Second, the polls may not be accurate. True, all of the last 30 polls show him ahead. But while nine give him a double-digit lead, 10 have him ahead by just five points or less - within the margin of error. In other words, it could yet tighten and probably will.</p> <p>But for now the fundamentals of his campaign are strong. And while McCain may keep trading in smears, for the time being no one seems to be buying them.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:g.younge@theguardian.com\">g.younge@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>In three months' time, George Bush will be back on his ranch in Texas - to the world's relief as well as, increasingly plainly, his own. He may have spoken some wise words about internationally coordinated action against the global financial crisis after meeting G7 finance ministers at the White House on Saturday, but he is rapidly becoming part of the past. In 22 days, Americans will select his successor. The responsibility of leading the United States and the developed world through these increasingly grim times will soon fall to either Barack Obama or John McCain. </p> <p>Unless the current opinion polls are seriously wrong - or unless something new and decisive occurs in the campaign before November 4 - it seems likely that the responsibility will fall on Mr Obama's shoulders. Mr McCain built a strong position during the summer and came out of the conventions with a powerful bounce, largely caused by the novelty of his selection of Sarah Palin as his running mate. But as the final phase of the campaign got under way and with voters at last bending their minds to the long-running contest everything has moved consistently Mr Obama's way. The national polls currently give him an average lead of around seven points. This lead, moreover, is growing - the latest Newsweek survey has Mr Obama with an 11-point lead, while a Fox News survey has Mr McCain dipping as low as 39% among registered voters. Polls also show Mr Obama ahead in several swing states and competitive in states that normally vote for the Republican nominee.</p> <p>This is partly because the Palin candidacy has been exposed for what it is, a political firework rather than an electoral rocket that would carry Mr McCain to the White House. This has happened less because of the Troopergate inquiry or some sharp television satires - though neither of these has helped - than simply because the Alaska governor's credentials have been increasingly held up to the light. The simple truth is that Mrs Palin has been found wanting as a potential president. Mr McCain's chances of becoming the oldest president to take office in US history have been relentlessly undermined by the manifest inadequacy of the person who would succeed him if age or infirmity suddenly took their toll, and because that choice reflects so lamentably on Mr McCain's own judgment.</p> <p>The much larger factor, however, is the economy. The more that American voters have focused on their economic woes, the more decisively the presidential contest has shifted in Mr Obama's favour. This is partly because the Republicans are so deeply associated with the economic philosophy that is now in institutional freefall, partly because the Democrats are, in general terms, still the party of federal action to defend the disadvantaged, partly because the accelerating downturn has happened on the watch of a generally unimpressive Republican president and partly because Mr Obama has handled economic questions with more skill and substance in his debates with Mr McCain. Yet Mr Obama has also been careful to keep the dramas in Washington and on Wall Street at arm's length. The next president will face the most daunting economic agenda since Franklin Roosevelt. It is far from clear how Mr Obama - who regularly drops protectionist hints - would tackle this global recession.</p> <p>Right now, of course, his priority is simply to get elected. The exchanges are turning dirtier - again to the McCain campaign's shame - and the great unspoken question of Mr Obama's race seems likely to play an even more prominent part in the final phase. If the 2008 election becomes reframed as another culture wars contest then the current gap may narrow. As long as the economy is not just the main issue in voters minds but, as now, the overriding one, then it seems that Mr Obama will win. If he does, it will be a marvellous moment. But it will also be the moment when the real work starts.</p>",

Blair defended himself on television as a \"pretty straight sort of guy\" after the government announced proposals to exempt formula one from the ban on tobacco advertising on November 5 - three weeks after Blair met formula one boss Bernie Ecclestone and Max Mosley, president of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), in Downing Street on October 16. Ecclestone had donated \u00a31m to Labour in January of that year.</p> <p>\"It was a collective decision, made in the normal way,\" Blair told Luff in the Commons on November 12. \"I met [Ecclestone and Mosley] on October 16. No decisions were taken then ... Finally, at the beginning of last week, there was the decision to seek a specific exemption for formula one.\"</p> <p>The government papers challenge Blair's account because they show that the day after his Ecclestone meeting, Jonathan Powell, Blair's chief of staff, wrote to Tessa Jowell, then health minister, to say: \"The prime minister would like your ministers to look for ways of finding a permanent derogation for sport, in particular F1.\"</p> <p>Jowell wrote to Blair on October 24 setting out a series of options including an exemption. No 10 replied on October 29: \"His [the prime minister's] view remains that we should seek to negotiate a permanent exemption for Formula 1, backed up by the voluntary agreement with the FIA.\"</p> <p>The government informed the EU on November 5 that it wanted to exempt motor racing from the ban. Labour contacted the standards watchdog on November 7 to ask for his advice on the donation from Ecclestone, a move that was to embarrass Gordon Brown because he told the Today programme three days later that he did not know whether the multi-millionaire had donated to Labour.</p> <p>Maples and Luff believe the papers, released to the Sunday Telegraph after a lengthy freedom of information battle, show they were misled. Luff questioned Blair in the Commons on November 12 and Maples tabled a written parliamentary question. Blair told Luff that no decision was made on October 16; Blair's answer to Maples referred him to his answer to Luff.</p> <p>Maples said: \"I was misled, putting it at its best, in answer to a parliamentary question. I am horrified.\" Luff said: \"It now turns out that I was misled and the house was misled quite materially. I will be exploring with the Speaker what the appropriate steps are for the house to ensure its integrity is protected and the record corrected.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for Blair said: \"There is absolutely nothing new here. All these issues were known and debated at the time.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Tuesday October 14 2008</strong></p> <p> We were wrong to say in the article below that about 10 million registered Jewish voters live in Florida. Florida currently has about 10.7 million registered voters in total, of whom about 5% are Jewish. This has been corrected. </p> <p> </p> <p>This year Kenny Furst came close to breaking the habit of a lifetime. Brought up in a Jewish neighbourhood in the Bronx, New York, under Roosevelt's New Deal, he is and always has been a Democrat. But this year, for the first time, the 90-year-old was veering towards voting Republican or not at all.</p> <p>The problem was Barack Obama. \"He's the first Democratic candidate I haven't been sure about. As far as I was concerned he was connected with the Arabs,\" Furst said, speaking in Tamarac, Florida, where he retired to 18 years ago.</p> <p>For his wife Selma, 87, as for many Jewish Americans, the ties to the Democratic party were also umbilical. Yet she did not like the idea of an African American president, and was worried about rumours that Obama was a secret Muslim. Then something happened. </p> <p>Their grandson announced he was flying from Los Angeles, 2,500 miles away, to visit. Mike Bender had learned of an internet-driven initiative to get young Jewish voters to make a \"great schlep\" to Florida to persuade their wavering grandparents to vote for Obama. </p> <p>The viral movement was backed by a video message by the comedian Sarah Silverman, saying: \"You know why your grandparents don't like Obama, because his name sounds scary. Yes Barack Hussein Obama is a super shitty name, but you'd think somebody named Manishevitz Guberman would understand that.\"</p> <p>Bender watched the video, laughed, and decided to traverse the States to confront his grandparents. </p> <p>He was not alone. Over the weekend dozens of young Jewish Americans travelled to Florida with the ambition of swinging this ultimate swing state in favour of Obama. Hundreds more have made the lesser schlep, or \"mini schlep\" - lobbying their grandparents by phone.</p> <p>The thinking behind it starts with the assumption, widely held by political analysts, that if John McCain, is to have any chance he must win Florida. Democrats have taken the state only three times in the past 12 presidential elections: Lyndon Johnson in 1964; Jimmy Carter in 1976; and Bill Clinton in 1996. But the contest has frequently been close, famously so in 2000 when George Bush squeezed into the White House with just 537 more votes in Florida than Al Gore.</p> <p>That sense of opportunity explains why the Obama campaign has posted hundreds of staff in the state and is spending a record $39m (\u00a323m) there, far more than McCain. The investment has to some extent paid off, with polls showing a three-point lead, though that falls within the margin of error.</p> <p>Which is where the Jewish vote comes in. About half a million registered Jewish voters live in Florida, mainly older people in retirement condominiums along the so-called Gold Coast. Most are lifelong Democrats originating from New York and the north-east, but this year there is estimated 13% who, like the Fursts, are undecided. That equates to up to 100,000 votes: enough to determine the outcome of Florida, and with it the fate of the nation.</p> <p>\"The number one way to influence the outcome of the election as Jewish people is to influence your grandparents in Florida,\" said Ari Wallach, an instigator of the great schlep. </p> <p>Those who embarked on that schlep found the going was sometimes tough. University student Cobin Dopkeen, who flew from Boston, had no need to convert his grandparents who are already for Obama, so instead accosted other residents and visitors in their retirement complex in Miami. Which is when he met Lenny, a 62-year-old Floridian out for a walk with his 92-year-old father.</p> <p>\"You have to be out of your fucking mind to support Obama,\" was Lenny's reply. \"Number one: he supports Hamas. Number two: he sat with Reverend Wright for 20 years as he spieled out his antisemitic hatred.\"</p> <p>And Lenny doesn't want a black president. \"I grew up in the sixties when blacks were called nigger. OK, nowadays I say N-word, but I still think it.\"</p> <p>Republicans in south Florida predict a 10% spike for McCain in the Jewish vote over the 24% polled by Bush in 2004. Their campaign line is that if Obama wins he will be the first pro-Palestinian US president since the foundation of the state of Israel. The Democrats hit back with leaflets showing Obama by Jerusalem's Wailing Wall wearing a yarmulka.</p> <p>From most schleppers' experiences, the unbending hostility of Lenny was the exception. Many reported a warm reception from most Jewish Americans in Florida who are already in the Obama camp. Others notched up success stories, including Bender's grandparents. </p> <p>His visit moved and impressed. It led to long conversations in which he sought to allay their fears. Obama was a Christian, he said, a vocal supporter of Israel who has pledged to work for all Americans. The final hurdle was convincing his grandmother that Obama was not a Muslim. \"I said to her that if there are any people who can understand the wickedness of lies said about them, it is the Jews. That hit home.\"</p> <p>Within a day of their grandson's arrival, the Fursts had declared for Obama and had begun proselytising with the zeal of the newly converted. Kenny Furst has been posting Obama flyers at the bagel shop where he still works, and his wife is holding discussion groups with other Jewish women from the retirement home. </p> <p>\"I'm so proud of my grandparents, that they were open-minded enough to listen,\" said Bender. </p> <p>\"I've got a couple of years to go, so this vote isn't for me,\" said his grandfather. \"All I'm interested in now is that my grandchildren should be safe. This one is for them.\"</p>",
  "<p>Sarah Palin was forced to expend precious time and political capital over the weekend fighting to contain the fallout from the so-called Troopergate affair, following an official investigation in Alaska that reprimanded her for abusing her office as governor in pursuit of a family feud.</p> <p>Palin attempted to neutralise the findings into her official conduct by labelling the inquiry a \"partisan circus\". </p> <p>\"I'm thankful that the report has shown that there was no illegal or unethical activity there,\" she told reporters at a campaign stop in Pennsylvania on Saturday, adding that the investigation was \"a partisan kind of process that had been undertaken by some of the legislators who haven't been real happy with anything that I've done along the way as governor\".</p> <p>The vice-presidential candidate emphasised the fact that the investigation, carried out by a former prosecutor, Stephen Branchflower, had exonerated her from any impropriety in her decision to sack the head of Alaska's public safety commission, Walt Monegan, soon after she came to office. The inquiry concluded that as governor she had every right to choose her top officials.</p> <p>But she glossed over the findings that she had broken ethics rules, which amounted to an abuse of her office. The report found that she had applied pressure on Monegan to dismiss her former brother-in-law, Mike Wooten, a state trooper who had been through an acrimonious divorce with Palin's sister.</p> <p>Palin's husband, Todd, came under particular scrutiny in the 300-page Troopergate report, which was published on Friday. It noted that he spent half his time in the governor's office, making full use of state facilities and participating in official meetings.</p> <p>He also made extensive approaches to officials in which he called on them to fire Wooten. Branchflower concluded that these were \"impermissible\" and put officials in a conflict of interest.</p> <p>In an official representation to the inquiry, Todd Palin denied any wrongdoing. \"I have heard criticism that I am too involved in my wife's administration,\" he said. \"My wife and I are very close. We are each other's best friend. I have helped her in her career the best I can, and she has helped me.\"</p> <p>Republican officials likened his role to that of the politically engaged first lady Eleanor Roosevelt during the 1930s and 1940s.</p> <p>Palin's characterisation of the report as a \"partisan circus\", made during a conference call with reporters, is likely to be strongly disputed by the cross-party committee of the Alaskan legislature, which commissioned the inquiry and unanimously agreed to publish it. </p> <p>The events put under the microscope by the report occurred before Palin was nominated by John McCain to be his Republican presidential running mate. </p> <p>But the findings come as a further blow to the standing of the Alaskan governor who has already been damaged by a series of clumsy television interviews, and provides further distraction from McCain's attempts to revitalise his campaign in the face of a Democratic surge.</p>",
  "<p>If you want one image of how surreally upended politics has been in the wake of the financial crisis, try this one. Peter Mandelson was clapped and cheered by the parliamentary Labour party (PLP) last week. It has been a real shock to his system. He has gone about shaking his head in disbelief.</p> <p>The PLP no doubt startled itself. But it may have been right. I do think he is going to be important to the politics of the next year or two. It's all about Gordon Brown's second chance (and Peter's third) and how the prime minister plays the opportunity unexpectedly thrust at him by global financial meltdown.</p> <p>Brown's sunnier mood is easy to explain in psychological terms. Though he has a huge burden to carry, as he struggles to persuade other political leaders to agree to the kind of rescue plan the Treasury has devised, another and greater burden has been lifted from him. That was simply the burden of asking himself every day what he was for - what was the point of Gordon Brown? He knows again. We know too.</p> <p>Big-picture politicians relish crisis. Great events enthuse rather than crush them. What Brown found intolerable through many of the New Labour years was that serious politics was elbowed aside by the market economy. He might have been chancellor, but while the sun shone and inflation stayed low, and the City boys built their castles of gold, people didn't really notice. His elaborate and sometimes grandiose schemes to recapitalise the NHS, change the welfare system and end child poverty in Africa were the strident assertions of a politician who wanted politics to count.</p> <p>And now, at last, it does. The Tories may have had a spring in their step last month. Brown has a wintry, determined stride instead. Yet he could still mess things up. If his great plan fails and the economy plunges into depression, with huge levels of public borrowing and emergency tax rises needed, he could find his reputation crumbling once more.</p> <p>There is not much he can do about that, except forge ahead to try to fix the immediate crisis. But in smaller matters there is a lot more to do. One senior Labour figure puts it like this. At the time of the last Great Depression, during an earlier US presidential contest, there was little concrete to choose between the policies of Hoover and those of Roosevelt. But FDR hit the mood of the country better, triumphed, and is remembered in history. Right now, Barack Obama seems to be achieving something similar.</p> <p>He is managing to stand so tall, he almost seems above party politics. Here, even as David Cameron is failing to find his new voice and tone, Brown has not yet spoken to the country as he ought to. He needs to speak plainly about the hardships and choices ahead. But he also needs to offer hope and explain clearly his plan for getting out of this mess. There was never a greater need for the right words, well spoken.</p> <p>Next, he has to recalibrate his attitude to the daily cut and thrust of Westminster politics. This is where Mandelson comes in. For all his faults, he used to be able to give Blair and Brown confidence, setting out choices and phrases, and sharpening their performances. Some of that, I'm told, is coming back. Mandelson is of the same generation as Brown, and the prime minister is able to take criticism from him - as he could not from younger politicians who had grown up in his shadow. It nearly wasn't Mandelson. There was serious talk about putting Alastair Campbell into the Lords with a government job instead. Anyway, Brown now has the support he needs.</p> <p>So, how will this manifest itself? One early test will come on the 42-day detention issue. It is clearly going to be defeated in the Lords later today. What will Brown do then? Lord Falconer, who was so involved as lord chancellor, and who originally supported Tony Blair's defeated plan for 90-day detention limits, offers an interesting perspective. He's now against 42 days. Why? Because after the 90-day vote, the authorities discovered a loophole.</p> <p>Normally, before someone is charged, the police have to show evidence that there is a 51% or more likelihood of conviction. But in special cases, such as domestic violence, where they need to get an individual out of circulation, they can charge after asserting an \"honest belief\" that conviction will follow. This loophole is being increasingly used in terrorism cases. So the 42-day issue has become more symbolic than real.</p> <p>The old Brown would have said, in effect - exactly! Egged on by macho advisers, he would have relished bloody conflict to prove his political virility. Use the parliament act. Crush the rebels. Mock the Tories. That's how politics is done, isn't it?</p> <p>Well, no, actually, not any more. The mood has changed. Brown no longer needs to create false battlefields. He has a bigger one that's all too real. The atmosphere is for politicians to get together and sort things out. Look at all the stories about Vince Cable or Blair being drafted into a new government of national unity. There are even senior Tories glancing coquettishly at Labour. You don't have to believe any of this will actually happen to see it's the sort of thing people would quite like.</p> <p>Circumstances such as these mean Brown has to set a new mood, including being clear about which battles are central and worth spending time on, and which are not. If Cameron launches opportunistic cheap shots in the Commons, or if George Osborne leaks initiatives for party political purposes, then Brown should let them be the McCain-mimickers and instead draw his inspiration from Obama. He should rise above it, barely engage with it, and address the national crisis only. Despite his personal crises, and his past as a ferocious partisan, I have a shrewd idea that Mandelson understands all this very well.</p> <p>It's all about confidence, isn't it? Brown started as a big figure, then began to shrivel as it seemed that his choices, on election timing and tax, were driven by personal and party advantage. Like many people, I despaired: I'd seen a bigger Brown. In the past year he seemed dithery, almost lost. If this crisis, and the support of old stagers like Mandelson, can restore the old confidence then maybe Brown can rise fully to the occasion. In which case, everything becomes possible. There is already talk of a \"Falklands\" election - a quick poll if Brown manages to sort out the financial crisis.</p> <p>Let's be realistic. The economics are unpredictable. Bad news still lies ahead. Labour MPs are still deeply gloomy about their chances. The likeliest outcome remains a Cameron victory. But at last we have a government that knows what it is for.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jackie.ashley@theguardian.com\">jackie.ashley@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Zimbabwe's opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, today threatened to pull out of a power-sharing deal after the country's president, Robert Mugabe, unilaterally announced he had taken control of all major cabinet posts, including those responsible for the military and police.</p> <p>South Africa's former president, Thabo Mbeki, is expected in Harare tomorrow to try and rescue the agreement he brokered, under which Tsvangirai is appointed prime minister and Mugabe remains president but with far few powers than before.<br> Tsvangirai told a rally in Harare today that he would not be pressured by Mugabe into joining an administration dominated by the president's Zanu-PF party when the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) won the last reputable elections in March. </p> <p>\"If they do it that way, we have no right to be part of such an arrangement,\" said Tsvangirai. \"The people have suffered. But if it means suffering the more in order for them to get what is at stake, then so be it. We will renegotiate until an agreement is reached but that does not mean we will compromise for the sake of it.\"</p> <p>Mugabe announced the appointment of new cabinet posts this weekend, allocating his party jurisdiction over the various security and intelligence forces as well as the justice portfolio and the information ministry, which has control over Zimbabwe's highly partisan pro-Mugabe state newspapers and broadcasters.</p> <p>The MDC described the move as a \"giant act of madness which puts the whole deal into jeopardy\" and as a ploy to pre-empt Mbeki's visit to unblock the logjam over the distribution of ministries. </p> <p>\"The elite in Zanu-PF is not interested in addressing the current challenges in the country. Instead, they are obsessed with power retention at all costs,\" Tsvangirai's party said.</p> <p>The MDC says it will agree to Zanu-PF having authority over the military but that Tsvangirai must control home affairs, which oversees the police, and the justice ministry. That is important to Tsvangirai to ensure that Zanu-PF does not repeat its violent campaign at the next election.</p> <p>Mugabe's move is a demonstration of his power to obstruct the political deal he described as \"humiliating\" after he was forced to sign it last month. But the Zimbabwean president's overall position remains weak.</p> <p>There will be no foreign aid to rescue an economy collapsing under hyperinflation - officially put at 231 million percent but which in reality runs into the trillions - without Tsvangirai wielding real authority at the head of a genuine power sharing government. </p> <p>Mugabe only signed the political agreement with the opposition because his administration has no solutions to the economic crisis. Thus, while he can block implementation of the deal, and keep control of the government, he will be left facing even deeper problems than when he was forced into the deal.<br> Neither can Mugabe count on Mbeki to protect him after a change of administration in South Africa. Although Mbeki remains the mediator, South Africa's new president, Kgalema Montlanthe, and those around him are hostile to Mugabe and there is a growing mood inside the new government to confront Zimbabwe's leader.</p>",

Homelessness is a chronic problem in the US. I lived in Washington DC for almost seven years, and you'll see people sleeping in many areas of downtown and even near the White House.</p> <p>Joel John Roberts is the CEO of the housing development organisation <a href=\"http://www.pathpartners.org\">PATH Partners,</a> and he also writes the <a href=\"http://www.lahomelessblog.org\">LA Homeless blog</a>. The federal government says that homelessness is down, but he says that all you have to do is <a href=\"http://www.lahomelessblog.org/2008/10/world-watches-growth-of-american-tent.html\">read local newspapers across the US</a> to realise that the economic crisis is driving people onto the streets and into new tent cities and shanty towns.</p> <p>The rise in foreclosures and a rise in homelessness could affect the election because Republicans have moved to challenge voters who are registered at the addresses of foreclosed homes. </p> <p>Joel said that many of the homeless of LA are hidden. They disappear along the freeways, under bridges, bushes and in parks. It's difficult for him to estimate whether the homeless organisation that he heads is seeing an increase in homelessness. \"We're always maxed out,\" he says.</p> <p>Nationally, <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5htD-5rvP6yK7RZ008IAiqfAI5ZGgD9398LEG0\">61 percent of local and state homeless coalitions say they've seen a rise</a> in homelessness since the foreclosure crisis began in 2007, according to a report by the National Coalition for the Homeless.</p> <p>About 1% of the US population is homeless, in a large urban county like Los Angeles that means tens of thousands of people. The US government has targeted chronic homelessness, spending more than a billion dollars to reduce chronic homelessness by 15-20%. In 2005, the US government counted 80,000 homeless people in a three-day count in Los Angeles County, and two years later, they found 72,000. Joel calls this a \"homeless numbers game\" and said that government had just perfected their counting. Even with the reduced number, there are only 15,000 shelter beds in LA. And that count was last year before the housing crisis really gathered steam. </p> <p>The count is also might misrepresent the problem of homelessness. Social services departments in LA say about 225,000 people say they were homeless at one point in time over the last year.</p> <p>\"To me, it's very disgusting to be a part of a country that allows this. I get angry when political people tell me that it's getting better. I see people losing homes right and left,\" he said.</p> <p>However, most people who have lost their homes to foreclosure are not ending up on the streets, Joel said. Most of them are returning to the rental market. What he worries is that affordable housing has not kept pace with demand in the Los Angeles area. If large numbers of people are forced back onto the rental market, it might cause prices to increase, which would force people at the lower end of the market into homelessness.</p> <p>Banks loaned money to people who couldn't afford their mortgages in the first place, he said. In late 2006, some families with sub-prime mortgages <a href=\"http://www.thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=355\">defaulted on their loans without ever making a payment</a>. He advocates taking foreclosed homes and turning them into affordable housing.</p> <p><strong>A rise in tent cities</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/opinion/la-oe-vergara5-2008oct05,0,5231600.story\">Shanty towns have existed for decades</a> in American cities, but with anxiety about the economy, people are watching to see if large scale camps develop like the 1930s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooverville\">Hoovervilles</a>, named after President Herbert Hoover who was blamed for causing the Great Depression.</p> <p>Joel says that while shanty towns may have existed in US cities that his monitoring of local media across the country shows a spike in stories about them. \"I don't buy the political perspective that homelessness is getting better when local papers are writing about more tent cities around,\" he said.</p> <p>In Reno Nevada, joblessness has jumped 60% and a tent city of 170 people grew. <a href=\"http://www.mercurynews.com/breakingnews/ci_10660008\">Reno is trying to shut down the tent city</a> and move people to newly opened shelters. CBS News has reported <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/10/01/eveningnews/main4493104.shtml\">tent cities in Seattle, Portland, Fresno, Columbus, and Chattanooga.</a> There are also reports of encampments in <a href=\"http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/382847_nickelsville11.html?source=mypi\">Seattle</a>, San Diego, and Columbus, Ohio, Santa Barbara and Fresno California.</p> <p><strong>How does this impact the election?</strong></p> <p>The chronic homeless usually don't vote. They have no fixed address to register. Some states such as <a href=\"http://www.daytondailynews.com/n/content/oh/story/news/local/2008/10/09/ddn100908voting.html\">Ohio have tried to help homeless to vote,</a> but Republicans challenged the voter registration drive even though the law that allowed it was passed by the Republican-controlled Ohio legislature in 2006.</p> <p>The wave of foreclosures, which in some areas of the country disproportionately affect black voters, could also come into play. The Republican Party of Macomb County Michigan, one of three counties that make up Detroit, is planning to use list of <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/09/12/politics/animal/main4443434.shtml\">foreclosed homes to challenge people</a> who try to vote using those addresses.</p> <p>Republicans claim that they are trying to prevent voter fraud.
