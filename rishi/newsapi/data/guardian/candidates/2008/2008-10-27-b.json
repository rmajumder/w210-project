  "<p>I see that Reverend Wright is resurfacing, just a bit, and I see that Obama said something on the radio seven years ago that pisses conservatives off. Boy. I don't know, I've been wrong before, but it seems to me like they'll need more than this. </p> <p>The American people have sized up Obama for the better part of two years now. Polls indicate very clearly that swing voters have decided that he's not nearly as dangerous and risky as four more years of conservative governance. Late reminders can influence some votes, and depending on how sleazy things get, states like Missouri and Indiana can be tipped back to McCain. But he needs a lot more help than that, and I don't think Reverend Wright takes him where he needs to be.</p>",
  "<p>Law enforcement officers have foiled a plot by two neo-Nazis who aimed to assassinate Barack Obama and kill 102 other black people, according to court records unsealed today.</p> <p>The disrupted plot involved robbing a gun store to obtain weapons that the two skinheads would use against Obama and black students in the state of Tennessee, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), a US law enforcement agency.</p> <p>ATF agents confiscated five guns from the two perpetrators, 20-year-old Daniel Cowart of Bells, Tennessee, and 18-year-old Paul Schlesselman of West Helena, Arkansas. Both are being held without bail by authorities.</p> <p>\"They said that would be their last, final act, that they would attempt to kill Senator Obama,\" Jim Cavanaugh, the special agent in charge of the ATF's Nashville office, told the Associated Press. </p> <p>\"They didn't believe they would be able to do it, but that they would get killed trying.\"</p> <p>Although the perpetrators were doubtful of their ability to carry out their grisly plans, the plot risks stoking the simmering cauldron of racial uncertainty that Obama has faced in rural areas of the US. </p> <p>Even as polls show his support among white voters reaching a record high for a Democratic candidate, workers for the Obama campaign have confronted the legacy of prejudice in the south and Appalachian areas.</p> <p>Obama campaign offices in several states have been defaced with racist graffiti, and door-to-door canvassers have shared reports of voters making prejudiced remarks about the candidate. </p> <p>Three men were detained two months ago during the Democratic convention in Denver after discussing a plot to kill Obama, but prosecutors did not deem that incident a credible threat.</p> <p>The two neo-Nazis chose 102 as the number of victims for their plot based on numerology that is significant to white supremacists. They are facing charges of unregistered firearm possession, conspiracy to steal firearms from a licensed gun dealer, and making threats to a candidate for president.</p>",
  "<p>A bad election year for Republicans got even worse today as the party's elder statesman and longest-serving senator, Ted Stevens, was found guilty of hiding lavish gifts he received from an oil executive.</p> <p>The conviction of Stevens came after a month-long trial that became a national media event in the US, complete with stunning errors by government prosecutors and a reported violent outburst by one juror. </p> <p>The jury ultimately convicted Stevens, 84, on all of the seven felony counts he faced, deciding that the influential Republican lied to conceal the bounty he was given by the chief of an oil company in his home state of Alaska \u2013 including home renovations, discounted cars, a stained-glass window, and a live sled dog.</p> <p>The verdict significantly harms Republican chances of holding onto Stevens's seat in Congress next week, when he must stand for re-election against a young Democratic mayor, Mark Begich. The prospect of ending Stevens's 40-year career has raised Democratic spirits.</p> <p>The Stevens conviction has the potential to help as well as hurt John McCain in the final days of the presidential race. Stevens and McCain, both famous for their tempers, often clashed over spending policy - with the Alaskan remaining a staunch supporter of the congressional pet projects, known as earmarks, that McCain often rails against.</p> <p>McCain's running mate, Sarah Palin, ran into trouble after her claim to have opposed an infamous Stevens earmark - dubbed the 'bridge to nowhere' - was debunked by fact-checkers. In fact, Palin held on to money for the bridge after Congress cancelled the earmark.</p> <p>The government case against Stevens was closely tied to his reputation as a power broker and influential friend of Alaskan industry, turning an unflattering spotlight on the state's political culture that risks dragging down Palin as well.</p> <p>Stevens was accused of knowingly hiding gifts from Bill Allen, the chief executive of Alaskan oil-services company Veco. It is a criminal offence for public officials to omit gifts from their annual financial reports, as Stevens did between 2000 and 2006.</p> <p>Defence lawyers depicted the senator as unfairly trapped in the net of aggressive prosecutors. Stevens' wife took the witness stand to accept blame for not keeping track of bills for the family home renovation, for which Veco partially picked up the tab.</p> <p>Stevens himself also took the stand, a move that may have cost him in the jury's eyes. He was combative and snappish with prosecutors, impugning the prosecution's tactics and providing a stark contrast to the laudatory testimony of Colin Powell, who served as an early character witness for the senator.</p> <p>Stevens faces up to 35 years in prison, but prosecutors are likely to recommend a far smaller sentence. A hearing to decide his fate, set for February, could be postponed if defence lawyers follow through on their vow to quickly appeal the case.</p> <p>As for Stevens's fate at the ballot box, he must decide whether to stand for re-election as a convict or resign to make way for a last-minute Republican replacement. Few in Washington believe he would take the latter option, however, and Stevens instructed reporters recently that a resignation \"would never happen, ever. Okay?\"</p>",
  "<p>Democratic leaders are raising their hopes of an election year sweep - winning the White House, and achieving solid majorities in both houses of Congress to dominate Washington on a scale unseen in 40 years.</p> <p>With Obama ahead in the polls, and Democrats set to expand their majority in the House of Representatives, party leaders are focused on consolidating their control of the Senate.</p> <p>Democratic as well as Republican leaders now believe it is possible Democrats will reach the magical number of 60 seats in the Senate.</p> <p>That would give the Democrats what is called a filibuster-proof majority, making it impossible for Republicans to cut off debate or limit legislation.</p> <p>If Barack Obama wins the White House, that would bring a consolidation of Democratic power in Washington unseen since the 1960s.</p> <p>\"This is a tectonic race,\" Charles Schumer, the New York senator who is overseeing the Democrats' Senate election campaign, told reporters last week. \"This will change things not just for an election cycle but a generation.\"</p> <p>A wave of anti-Republican sentiment, coupled with excitement over Obama's candidacy that has brought more Democrats to the polls in early voting, has seen Democrats predicting far bigger gains than expected even a few weeks ago.</p> <p>John McCain's faltering campaign for the White House has also hurt Republican candidates in battleground states.</p> <p>Both parties are now using the prospect of a filibuster-proof Senate in their campaigns.</p> <p>The Democrats are pushing for 60 as a goal that would allow Obama, if he's elected, to push through sweeping changes on energy, healthcare and foreign policy.</p> <p>The Republicans meanwhile are campaigning on the dangers of unchecked Democratic rule. Their television ads now routinely link Obama to Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House speaker, and Harry Reid, the Democratic Senate majority leader, warning of a dangerous liberal triumvirate.</p> <p>\"Liberals are bent on handing Barack Obama a filibuster-proof Senate majority to rubber-stamp his radical agenda,\" Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican warned in a fundraising email.</p> <p>Democrats won a 51-49 majority in the Senate after the 2006 elections. But that did not translate into effective power, under Senate rules that allow the minority party to extend debate and prevent legislation from being put to a vote.</p> <p>The Republicans launched nearly 100 filibusters in the last two years, reducing the Senate to a state of paralysis.</p> <p>Senate Democrats could not even manage to win enough votes to withdraw US forces from Iraq - even though several similar bills easily passed through the House. That could now change, Reid wrote in a recent email to supporters.</p> <p>\"Everything Democrats believe in and fight for is in reach,\" Reid wrote. \"We have a breathtaking opportunity to change America ... We stand at the very brink of electing Barack Obama president and giving him a filibuster-proof majority.\"</p> <p>But solid majorities in Congress are no guarantee that a president will actually win co-operation from his own party - as Jimmy Carter knows. The Democrats won 61 seats in the Senate when Carter was elected in 1976, but he rapidly fell out with his party.</p> <p>Obama, if elected, could also run into resistance from a number of the new crop of Democratic challengers, especially those competing in southern states. A number of the first-time Democratic contenders lean to the right, while some of the Republicans now fighting for their political survival are moderates.</p> <p>\"You are going to have some defections on the Democratic side because these are some conservative Democrats,\" said Rhodes Cook, who runs a respected political newsletter. \"Whoever is elected will be hemmed in by the economy a great deal so that might also be the point that overrides the size of the majority.\"</p> <p>Democrats are hoping to capture a number of important seats in the Senate, including in formerly bedrock Republican regions like the south and Rocky Mountain west.</p> <p>Out of the 35 seats up for election, Republicans are defending 23 and the Democrats just 12. Democrats are leading in all the races they are defending and party leaders say they are confident of winning all 12 seats.</p> <p>But Republicans face tough contests across the map, with Democrats even or ahead in about a dozen seats.</p> <p>By last week, Republican congressional candidates were near open revolt against McCain. John Ensign, the Nevada Republican who is heading the party's Senate election campaign, was describing McCain as a drag on his fellow candidates.</p> <p>\"Our candidates are running ahead of John McCain in almost every place that I mentioned across the country,\" he told a briefing at the National Press Club.</p> <p>The challenges to the Republicans cut across geography as well as ideology. Seats held by retiring senators in Virginia, New Mexico and Colorado are now virtually assured of going Democratic.</p> <p>Party elders even in conservative states are facing a tough time. In North Carolina, Elizabeth Dole, who served in two Republican administrations and ran for the White House herself in 2000, is having to spend her own money to fend off a Democratic challenger.</p> <p>There are also tight contests in Mississippi and Georgia, where a high turnout of African-American voters for Obama in early voting appears to have breathed new life into Democratic Senate challenges once seen as longshots.</p> <p>The fate of Alaska senator Ted Stevens depends how the electorate views the guilty verdict in his trial on corruption charges. The jury found Stevens guilty on seven counts.</p>",

  "<p>In 2004, John Kerry ran a fairly straightforward secularist election campaign, in effect ceding the so-called \"values voters\" to George Bush. Bill Clinton, among others, had counseled Kerry to moderate this strategy. Clinton even suggested to Kerry that he loudly oppose gay marriage in toss-up states like socially conservative Ohio, but Kerry begged off, explaining that he didn't want to appear intolerant.</p> <p>After Kerry's defeat, Democrats <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/08/15/value.voters/index.html\">resolved not to commit</a> the same mistake again. They quickly formed committees and groups dedicated to casting Democratic party policies in a religious light. </p> <p>Barack Obama, in particular, embraced this strategy. He shrewdly sensed the possibilities of poaching some values voters from the Republican party by adopting a tone of religious uplift and giving a religious patina to his policies, particularly his anti-war one.</p> <p>Recent polls suggest that the strategy is paying off. <a href=\"http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=349\">According to the Pew Forum</a>, Obama has scooped up a majority of \"white non-hispanic Catholic\" registered voters, with 49% of them supporting or leaning toward him and 41% supporting or leaning toward John McCain. </p> <p>This is a notable feat, given that a rating for Obama's voting record on the moral issues most crucial to the Catholic Church \u2014 abortion, gay civil unions, etc \u2014 would surely rank near zero.</p> <p>Obama also enjoys increasing support from \"white mainline Protestant\" registered voters. He has shot ahead of McCain 48% to 43% among those voters.</p> <p>But something else is at work here, besides just Obama's effective outreach to religious voters. He is also benefiting from the leftward drift of religion in America in general. This is a long-unfolding trend that another survey \u2014 this one commissioned by <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/index_flash.html\">Religion &amp; Ethics NewsWeekly</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.unfoundation.org/\">United Nations Foundation</a> \u2014 <a href=\"http://www.greenbergresearch.com/index.php?ID=\" 2266\" \">points up</a>. </p> <p>Their survey found, for example, \"generational change\" among younger evangelical Christians who have adopted \"a <a href=\"http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/politics/2004406277_evangvote11m.html\">more inclusive definition</a> of what it means to be 'pro-life' and are more supportive of efforts to combat global warming\".</p> <p>Another striking finding from the survey \u2014 one which lends itself to Obama's anti-war pitch to Christians \u2014 is: \"The religious landscape has shifted with evangelical Christians now expressing the greatest support for an interventionist role, while more moderate religious groups like mainline Protestants and Catholics take a more isolationist posture\".</p> <p>Obama is deftly exploiting America's new Christian left. In recent days, his Catholic surrogates, such as the law professor <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/blogs/convictions/archive/2008/03/23/endorsing-obama.aspx\">Doug Kmiec</a>, have, like those younger evangelical Christians mentioned in the survey, stretched the definition of the phrase \"pro-life\" to include many issues beyond abortion, thereby confusing some anti-abortion Catholics into supporting Obama.</p> <p>Kmiec has even taken to arguing that Obama is more \"pro-life\" than McCain, despite the fact that Obama received a 100% voting rating from the women's rights group <a href=\"http://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/campaigns/268.htm\">Planned Parenthood</a>. Denver's Archbishop Charles Chaput has called Kmiec's novel reasoning a form of \"<a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/sns-ap-rel-archbishop-obama,0,921435.story\">self-hypnosis</a>\".</p> <p>Obama can see that American secularism has secularised almost everything, including religion itself. Therefore, a play for less-doctrinaire, secularised Christians becomes possible. The party's old secularist positions can even be shoehorned into fading Christian concepts.</p> <p>The poll conducted for Religion &amp; Ethics NewsWeekly and the United Nations Foundation sheds some light on this hybrid of secularism and religion increasingly popular in America: on the one hand, it found that despite \"increasing religious diversity, a majority agree with the notion that our nation is blessed and that it should set a Christian example to the world\". On the other hand, it found that there \"is less consensus around the ideologically charged areas of foreign policy, particularly women's rights and environmental policy. While most support efforts to improve maternal health, people are more divided on lifting the '<a href=\"http://www.globalgagrule.org/\">global gag rule</a>,' which would free up resources to organizations providing a full range of women's health services including abortion\".</p> <p>Obama grasped what John Kerry didn't: that beneath this growing confusion lay a considerable number of votes.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama attempted an act of political alchemy today, combining his campaign's early passion with the gritty reality of America's economic crisis to build a winning argument to send him to the White House.</p> <p>The Obama camp had billed today's speech as the Democrats' closing argument to the American people, 21 months after he began his run for the White House. He chose to deliver it in Ohio, the state which more than any other will decide whether Obama or John McCain wins the White House, one week from today.</p> <p>The speech was more of a summing up than a new line of persuasion as the Democrat tried to rally his supporters even while he moved to contain their expectations of change if he wins the White House.</p> <p>\"In one week, in one week, after decades of broken politics in Washington, eight years of failed policies from George Bush and 21 months of a campaign that has taken us from the rocky coast of Maine to the sunshine of California, we are one week from change in America,\" Obama told the crowd. But he went on to warn: \"It won't be easy, Ohio. It won't be quick.\"</p> <p>The candidate, who stepped off the stage in Canton today to his signature tune of \"signed, sealed, delivered\" was visibly greyer than the Obama who racked up his first victory in the Iowa caucus in early January.</p> <p>The signature appeal for hope and change which had so moved the crowds was weighed down by the economic crisis that has overwhelmed the election and contributed mightily to Obama's lead over McCain in battleground states.</p> <p>Obama got his wildest cheers when he promised to bring green jobs to Ohio and to scrap taxes for elderly people living on less than $50,000. But again he warned that his ambitious plans might be hostage to economic turmoil. \"I won't stand here and pretend that any of this will be easy - especially now,\" he said. \"The cost of this economic crisis, and the cost of the war in Iraq, means that Washington will have to tighten its belt and put off spending on things we can afford to do without.</p> <p>\"On this, there is no other choice.\"</p> <p>Today's meeting was in some ways a celebration of Obama's journey, with the Democrat reminding supporters of the improbable nature of his candidacy.</p> <p>It was also an indictment of McCain, who Obama cast as a clone of George Bush. \"Senator McCain still has not been able to tell the American people a single major thing he'd do differently from George Bush when it comes to the economy,\" he said. \"Senator McCain says that we can't spend the next four years waiting for our luck to change, but you understand that the biggest gamble we can take is embracing the same old Bush-McCain policies that have failed us for the last eight years.</p> <p>Obama will take other opportunities to try to seal the deal with American voters this week. Tomorrow, he has booked a half-hour slot on national networks for a primetime address. The slot, just as Americans tune in to Game Six of the World Series, is the most ambitious ad spend ever, and will cost the campaign more than $1m a network.</p> <p>There will be further razzmatazz Wednesday when Obama campaigns with Bill Clinton in Orlando, Florida.</p> <p>But his appearance today, before fewer than 5,000 supporters in this town, was a reminder that Obama still has a slog ahead of him in Ohio. No Democrat has won the White House without Ohio since John Kennedy in 1960, and the state is not natural terrain for Obama.</p> <p>While he has surged ahead of McCain in states that usually go Republican such as Virginia and Colorado, it has been a tougher, slower sell in Ohio - as even his most ardent supporters acknowledge.</p> <p>\"At times, it seems neck and neck to me,\" said Katy George. Her friend, Peggy Kelly, a chef at a local restaurant, chimed in: \"There are a lot of stubborn Republicans in the lower part of the state.\"</p> <p>But the campaign is feeling increasingly confident, buoyed by the heavy turnout in early voting, which started a week ago.</p> <p>Registered Democrats have swamped Republicans. In Cleveland, long lines of African American voters waited for more than two hours to cast their ballots, passing the time by singing the civil rights-era song Eyes on the Prize.</p> <p>The rush had the campaign scrambling today to find marching bands to entertain waiting voters on election day.</p> <p>Charlie Buhacker breaks eye contact and looks away when he says that he voted for George Bush over John Kerry in 2004. This time Buhacker was an early supporter of Obama. He has been working phone banks for Obama six nights a week for the last three months. He reckons he has logged 1,600 calls.</p> <p>It was slow going at first, he admits. People were suspicious of Obama and cynical about his message of hope. Some were outright racist. \"But that died down the last couple of weeks,\" he said. \"People realised it doesn't make a difference.\"</p> <p>He added: \"It's the economy.\"</p>",
  "<p>John McCain, searching for an elusive comeback with only a week left to the election, today warned Americans to face the prospect of the most liberal administration in the country's history if the Democrats are allowed to control both the White House and Congress.</p> <p>Campaigning in Ohio, which he described as \"a must-win\" state, McCain searched for a message that might still turn the election even at this late stage. He emphatically distanced himself from President George Bush's economic -policies and prepared to dust down one of his main selling points, his record as an American war hero.</p> <p>McCain, after a meeting with his economic advisers in Cleveland, Ohio, described Obama as \"the most liberal person to ever run for the presidency\". He labelled Obama, the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, and Harry Reid, the Democratic senate leader, as \"a dangerous threesome\". </p> <p>McCain's running mate, Sarah Palin, took up the same theme, telling a rally in Leesburg, Virginia: \"If big government spenders control the House and the Senate and heaven forbid the White House, they will have a monopoly in Washington.\"</p> <p>The warnings are a tacit admission by McCain and Palin of their underdog status.</p> <p>In the final frenetic days of campaigning, McCain and Obama are tracking one another across the battleground states.Both were in Ohio today, and are scheduled to be in Pennsylvania Tuesday and Florida Wednesday.</p> <p>These states are turning into McCain's last stand. Having lost ground elsewhere according to the polls, he can not afford to lose any of these three. This was his 14th visit to Ohio since securing the Republican presidential nomination earlier this year.</p> <p>Turnout at McCain's rallies in these states have been poor compared with Obama and he is being outspent in Ohio in advertising by four to one. </p> <p>He is taking a beating, too, on the normally passionately Republican talk-radio shows. Bill Cunningham, who broadcasts from Cincinnati, Ohio, and whose broadcasts go out on 300 stations across America, spent his Sunday night show berating McCain for the way he had conducted the campaign, making it clear he thought the election was lost and urging the Republicans to begin planning to ensure Obama does not secure a second term.</p> <p>After today's economic meeting, McCain again attempted to cut himself free from Bush, whose unpopularity is a massive drag on his campaign. McCain, who at the last presidential debate earlier this month reminded Obama he was not Bush, said after the Cleveland meeting that both he and Obama \"disagree with President Bush on economic policy\". </p> <p>However, he added, they had a fundamental difference on how to resolve the economic crisis. Obama wanted to raise taxes while McCain wanted to lower expenditure.</p> <p>Republicans critical of how McCain has been fighting the election campaign accuse him of failing to stick to a -message for any length of time. He began the campaign last month by stressing he had been tested by crisis as both a Navy fighter pilot and a POW in Vietnam, but has since largely dropped these claims from his repertoire.</p> <p>However, he is planning to return to the theme at a rally tomorrow in Florida, where he will be surrounded by several retired members of the military.<br></p>",

  "<p>With polls showing Barack Obama pulling ahead of John McCain in the US presidential race, the Republican party's hard-right evangelical allies are starting to panic. As the political elites in the movement freak out, they're sowing the seeds of grassroots anxiety that God will punish America for electing Obama. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14569a.htm\">Theodicy</a> lies at the heart of the evangelical right's political strategy: Christians must perpetually engage in spiritual warfare with Satan, and take dominion over governmental and legal institutions. God will be pleased then; but if these Christian soldiers fail to vanquish Satan, God won't be happy at all. Chaos ensues: socialism, Bible burning, abortions in public schools, boy scouts forced into homosexuality!<br> Religious-right honchos are girding the troops for political apocalypse. Townhall magazine, owned by Salem Communications, one of the largest Christian broadcasters in the country, ran a September feature, \"Obamageddon: Could We Survive a Barack Presidency?\" This month evangelical publishing giant Stephen Strang, whose magazine Charisma endorsed McCain, predicted that <a href=\"http://www.strangreport.com/2008/10/life-as-we-know-it-will-end-if-obama-is.html\">\"life as we know it will end if Obama is elected</a>.\" Last week, the political arm of James Dobson's Focus on the Family sent out a \"Letter from 2012 in Obama's America\", a <a href=\"http://focusfamaction.edgeboss.net/download/focusfamaction/pdfs/10-22-08_2012letter.pdf\">16-page (pdf)</a> parade of horribles, and talk radio show host Janet Porter imagined that <a href=\"http://www.rightwingwatch.org/2007/11/hillary_will_pu.html\">Christians will be imprisoned</a> with Obama in the Oval Office. </p> <p>Christian right activist and McCain supporter Gary Bauer openly worried to televangelist Rod Parsley that an Obama presidency could mean that \"God could take his hand of protection off of America.\" Further economic woes? A national security or military crisis? Don't blame the morally bankrupt party that the religious right has enabled for the past three decades. Blame Obamageddon. </p> <p>Fundamentalist Christians are perpetually eager for The End, with daily contemplations on television, radio, blogs and other media about whether the legalization of gay marriage, the financial meltdown, or the possibility of an <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1830590,00.html\">Antichrist president</a> are \"signs of the times\" \u2013 clues that the cultural chaos that will precede Christ's showdown with Satan at Armageddon is finally at hand. </p> <p>Yet how could you get the foot soldiers marching on election day if they would happily stay home waiting for the Rapture? That's why the leadership is promising God's punishment for failing to resist Satan's temptations. God won't be happy if America doesn't elect his \"<a href=\"http://www.salon.com/politics/war_room/2008/09/18/palin_email/index.html\">chosen</a>\" candidate, Sarah Palin, whose supporters believe is a modern-day <a href=\"http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/tapped_archive?month=10&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=prophecy_and_prayer_for_palins\">Queen Esther</a>. God will punish the country who reversed course on his carefully laid-out plan and elects the Muslim-socialist-terrorist instead.</p> <p>If McCain somehow pulls it off in the end the religious right will no doubt claim that its support \u2013 and God's hand \u2013 were indispensable for a come-from-behind victory. But if the polls are right and Obama wins, the fundamentalists are already poised to pounce on any new crisis, be it on economic, national security, or another front, as the latest divine cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre.</p>",

Last Thursday, the commander of US forces in western Iraq told reporters US troops were redoubling efforts to secure the Syrian border. Major General John Kelly said Iraq's western borders with Saudi Arabia and Jordan were fairly tight as a result of good policing by security forces in those countries, but Syria was \"a different story\".</p> <p>Thabet Salem, a political analyst, told the Arabic-language TV news channel al-Jazeera the US appeared to have mistaken building workers for infiltrators. \"It will raise questions as to why this is happening towards the end of the current US administration,\" he said.</p> <p>Last year the then US commander in Iraq, General David Petraeus, praised Syria's cooperation in reducing violence in Iraq. But Syria has since refused to restart intelligence-sharing with the US until Washington recognises its assistance by returning an ambassador to Damascus.</p> <p>Joshua Landis, a US expert on Syria, said last night: \"The Bush administration must assume that an Obama victory will force Syria to behave nicely in order to win favour with the new administration. Thus White House analysts may assume that it can have a freebie - taking a bit of personal revenge on Syria without the US paying a price.\"</p> <p>Syria is due to take a step in from the cold today when its foreign minister, Walid al-Mualim, visits London to hear praise for its newly conciliatory policies in Lebanon. Officials are expected to urge him to distance his nation from Iran.</p> <p>In recent months, Syria has established diplomatic relations with Lebanon and held several rounds of indirect talks with Israel, with Turkey acting as broker. In July, President Assad was invited to an EU summit in Paris.</p> <p>Some Iraqi leaders warned that opponents of a security pact under negotiation with the US would use the attack to support their arguments.</p>",

If you live in a \"swing state\", you may have seen most of them all too often. If you live outside the US, you may not have seen them at all. Either way, once the election is over, you probably don't expect to see them again\u2026</p> <p>But times have changed. Thanks to the internet, you can now watch almost any of these adverts at any time \u2013 more than 300 of them, going right back to 1952. And you can do it without going to YouTube.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.movingimage.us/site/site.php\">The Museum of the Moving Image, New York,</a> has collected more than 50 years of American political advertising at a single site: <a href=\"http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/\">The Living Room Candidate</a>. You can start with Disney's black and white cartoon for Dwight D Eisenhower and work your way through to Barack Obama.</p> <p>You can watch the adverts for John F Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W Bush \u2013 winners all. You can also see Barry Goldwater, Hubert Humphrey, George McGovern, Walter Mondale, Michael Dukakis, Ross Perot, Bob Dole and others who might have you saying \"Who?\"</p> <p>To put the ads in context, the site provides a brief summary of each campaign and the state of the nation. You also get a coloured map of the US to show the final result. </p> <p>Each advert also comes with a list of credits, a transcript and links to related ads. You can save or share ads, and create your own playlist. This makes the site a valuable educational resource, and so far eight lesson plans have been provided. Topics include Understanding the Language of Political Ads, and Children in Political Ads (political ads tend to feature cute kids).</p> <p>There are also selections of ads on various themes, such as civil rights, taxes, welfare and war.</p> <p>Browsing the site is fascinating. Old ads give you some instant insight into what America was like at the time, and tell you as much about the development of TV advertising as they do about politics. For example, the development from Eisenhower reading cue cards in 1952 to Ronald Reagan, a consummate actor, is remarkable. The political messages, however, remain much the same.</p> <p>When so many candidates are sold like cornflakes, John F Kennedy's use of a more documentary type of approach also stands out.</p> <p>One not to miss is the <a href=\"http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1964\">Lyndon Baines Johnson ad from 1964</a>, made by the Madison Avenue advertising agency Doyle Dane Bernbach. This segues from a cute little girl counting as she picks the petals off a daisy to the countdown to a nuclear explosion. The voiceover says: \"We must either love each other or we must die.\" It's a hugely powerful ad. It was only shown once: once was enough. </p> <p>The Living Room Candidate site was started in 2000, and it gets better every year. Especially every four years.</p>",

  "<p>If Sarah Palin had never come along, the McCain campaign's greatest contribution to pop-culture would surely have been <a href=\"http://www.mccainblogette.com/\">McCainBlogette</a>, starring the Arizona senator's 23-year-old, blonde, beer-swilling, John Kerry-voting daughter <a href=\"http://men.style.com/gq/blogs/gqeditors/2008/03/caps-font-var-1.html\">Meghan</a>. Which isn't to say the young McCain is jealous or anything. Meghan recently pronounced the Republican vice-presidential nominee <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/16/lkl.meghan.mccain/\">\"really chill\"</a> on Larry King Live.</p> <p>McCainBlogette is primarily a photo blog, garnished with Meghan's political commentary (<a href=\"http://www.mccainblogette.com/postings/101708_0829.shtml\">\"My father nothing short of ROCKED Wednesday night's debate.\"</a>), captions and favourite music playlists (grouped under titles such as \"Crazy, Sexy Country\"). This June 12, in a post titled \"Republican\", readers learned of her trip to an Arizona elections office in Phoenix to <a href=\"http://www.mccainblogette.com/archive/june_9_12.shtml\">change her party affiliation</a> for part one of a unique gift.</p> <p>Meghan explained to fans that though she had been \"registered as an Independent since I was 18 years old\" after some \"careful thought and consideration\", she decided to take the plunge and re-register \"as a Republican \u2026 as a symbol of my commitment to my dad and to represent the faith I have in his ability to be an effective leader for our country.\" She added: \"Happy Father's Day, Dad!\"</p> <p>The entry shows Meghan at the State Capitol Executive Tower building with her mother Cindy, filling out the change-of-party form, chatting it up with the Arizona secretary of state and calling our attention to an \"awesome PEZ dispenser collection\" in one of the photos.</p> <p>Part two of that present to her father, announced on the same day as her come-to-Eisenhower moment, has just been released by Simon &amp; Schuster. <a href=\"http://www.simonsays.com/content/book.cfm?tab=22&amp;pid=631312\">My Dad, John McCain</a> is a children's book in the same minimalist vein as Meghan's blog. Now, her brief story garnishes heavily crosshatched colour drawings by illustrator Dan Andreasen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-339020537\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/08/19/mccain140x130.jpg\" alt=\"My Dad, John McCain, by Megan McCain\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The book begins: \"There are a few things you need to know about my dad, and one of them is that he would make a great president.\" Meghan gives the young target audience a brief bio of her father that eschews any controversies and sticks to what's important. The subject was a bit of a rebel in school, you see, a brave pilot and then a resident of the Hanoi Hilton for five and a half years, where \"My dad and the other prisoners were treated badly \u2026 and the food was really bad - he once found a chicken foot in his lunch.\"</p> <p>Meghan also includes a potted civics lesson for first-graders: \"If you want to be president, first you have to be nominated by a political party. Then you run in the general election against the other candidates. My dad's a Republican, so he wanted the Republican party to choose him.\" She gives a special shout-out to the voters of New Hampshire for making that possible.</p> <p>What Meghan McCain fails to include is any convincing reason why senator McCain would make a great president other than that he is a \"great man\". She explains that he was a war hero who refused special treatment in Vietnam, reminds people that he's a \"maverick\" who'll \"say what he really thinks\" and professes unlimited faith in his patriotism: \"My father loves this country more than anyone I know.\"</p> <p>And, that's it. It would be too much to expect a children's book to explain the Republican nominee's tax or healthcare policies but My Dad, John McCain doesn't provide any hint whatsoever to where Meghan's dad would lead the country.</p> <p>Perhaps that's not the point of this book. It's not as if anyone is expecting her story to get out the elementary school vote for the Republicans. One way to read it is as nothing more than an expression of a daughter's undying admiration for her dear old dad. In that way, it's touching.</p> <p>But another way to read it is a diagnosis of everything that's wrong with the McCain candidacy. His handlers have tried to make this a campaign about the Arizona senator's outsized biography. It's not enough.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama </a>is taking the fight to states won by George Bush in a bid to open a wide path to the White House and keep <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a> on the defensive in the final week of the presidential campaign.</p> <p>The Democratic presidential hopeful will campaign in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/ohio\">Ohio</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/virginia\">Virginia</a>, while his wife, Michelle, heads to Nevada, New Mexico and Colorado, three western states Bush won but the Democrats are likely to take in November.</p> <p>In Canton, Ohio, Obama today will make what aides describe as a closing argument for his two-year campaign. He is expected to continue pressing the case that McCain will continue Bush's politics. McCain has acknowledged that he and Bush share \"a common philosophy of the Republican party\".</p> <p>\"In one week, you can put an end to the politics that would divide a nation just to win an election; that tries to pit region against region, city against town, Republican against Democrat; that asks us to fear at a time when we need hope,\" Obama will say, according to excerpts released by the campaign.</p> <p>\"After 21 months and three debates, Senator McCain still has not been able to tell the American people a single major thing he'd do differently from George Bush when it comes to the economy. Senator McCain says that we can't spend the next four years waiting for our luck to change, but you understand that the biggest gamble we can take is embracing the same old Bush-McCain policies that have failed us for the last eight years.\"</p> <p>In a reprise of Ronald Reagan's famous line from a 1980 debate, Obama will say: \"The question in this election is not 'Are you better off than you were four years ago?' We know the answer to that. The real question is, 'Will this country be better off four years from now?'\"</p> <p>McCain is concentrating on Pennsylvania, which has not voted Republican since 1988. Hillary Clinton defeated Obama there in the spring primary by 10 percentage points. After a rally in Ohio this afternoon, McCain returns to Pennsylvania for an event in Pottsville, central Pennsylvania, where McCain hopes to pick up enough culturally conservative, older whites to counter Obama's support in the cities of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. Polls show Obama leading in the state by about 10 percentage points.</p> <p>The Republican campaign has sent McCain's running mate, Sarah Palin, to defend Virginia, where she will hold two rallies.

  "<p>John McCain <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-liberal24-2008oct24,0,1269386.story\">accuses Barack Obama</a> of wanting \"European style socialism\" in the US. If only. <br> Apart from the irony that the Bush administration is effectively nationalising the commanding heights of the economy in the course of the current economic crisis, one would have thought that this is - shall we say to be kind - an inappropriate time for a candidate to sing songs of praise to capitalism red in tooth and claw. Gore Vidal and many others have quipped over the years that the US practices free enterprise for the poor and socialism for the rich, so what we are seeing now is not really a fundamental change in approach. Money in rich torrents for the banks and finance houses, and thin gruel for those about to be made homeless is on a par with food stamps that passed into legislation as a subsidy to US agriculture.  However, despite a natural tendency to disbelieve anything that McCain says in McCarthy-ite mode, it is indeed a truth that should be universally acknowledged that western Europe, even with the Thatcherite and Blairite hiccups, is indeed social democratic in its outlook. At the end of the second world war George Orwell predicted that western Europe was the most likely to succeed in establishing some form of democratic socialism, and he was right. Since 1950, western Europe has offered its citizens the highest combined standards of human, civil and social rights in world history. The west is red! It may have been Franklin Delano Roosevelt who coined the slogan about the four freedoms, from fear and want, and of belief and speech, but Europe put them into effect while the US remained bogged down in 19th century laissez-faire.  However, McCain's attempt to conflate Obama with European socialism and both with Soviet-style communism is as self evidently absurd as his conflation of Joe the Plumber's fiscal fate with Exxon-Mobil's. Even European conservative parties are far to the left of Obama in their professed conviction that some things are too important to leave to free markets, that the pursuit of untrammeled greed alone will not benefit society as a whole, and that societies have a collective responsibility to ensure the welfare of their citizens. Of course, European social-democracy is nothing like the Leninoid totalitarianisms that some on the left still see as the litmus test for socialism. My father, an eccentrically unrepentant fan of Stalin to his deathbed, had it right \"that Uncle Joe understood the dictatorship of the proletariat \u2013 the workers need a bayonet up their arse\". The Georgian shared this view with American free-marketers who believe that workers will only be productive when forced to work for less money by the threatened lash of unemployment. But we are at the end of a 60-year-old real-time experiment in the relative success of American laissez-faire and European social democracy. In 1945 Europeans were smaller and less healthy than the Americans. Some 60 years of European socialism later, the Dutch, for example are <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/popular/ci_6383832\">two inches taller</a> than Americans. <a href=\"http://atlanticreview.org/archives/661-Europeans-are-taller-than-Americans.html\">Europeans can expect</a> longer life spans, and much less infant mortality than their erstwhile liberators, who are cursed with a free market health system that leaves 45 million people uninsured, and is the least efficient in the industrialised world. Not coincidentally, it is the most expensive \u2013 and the most profitable. <br> Freedom from fear, as Roosevelt advocated in 1945, was implemented to a much larger degree in Europe. Mothers can take serious, guaranteed, paid maternity leave, compared with Clinton's big step forward \u2013 unpaid family leave. Those socialist Europeans are guaranteed sick pay for months, years, on end and guaranteed vacation time, which they can take without fear of retribution. And the enterprises in which they work are prospering and solvent on the basis that employees deserve some measure of the prosperity and security that McCain assumes only CEOs need to motivate them. If Obama and the Democrats were socialists, then Americans could enjoy the nearly universal health care of western Europe, not just in the sense of hospitals and doctors, but the health of the population \u2013 they would live longer for example <a href=\"http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa042000b.htm\">instead of being 42nd in the world longevity league</a>, they would have something higher than the <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2006/HEALTH/parenting/05/08/mothers.index/\">29th place in the world infant mortality tables</a>.<br> American workers, who have been on an effective pay freeze since Ronald Reagan took office, could enjoy the steadily rising incomes of their European counterparts. Who knows, maybe the murder rate would drop to civilised world standards and the \"socialist\" US could relinquish its <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/04/23/america/23prison.php\">positions at the top of the world</a> incarcerations and executions leagues.<br> Even justice suffers. At the time of the first OJ Simpson trial, I remember asking an American defence attorney which courts he would prefer, and he answered immediately, \"if I were rich and guilty, I'd want to be tried here. If I were poor and innocent \u2013 I'd prefer Europe\". There have been steps backward as European governments persuaded themselves that Washington was showing the way economically. However, one can only hope that Europeans, particularly social democrats, can surely see further than the coast of Alaska and deduce that the main lesson from McCain's United States are negative ones. It is time to put the clock forward in Europe from where it stopped under the baneful influence of Reagan, Thatcher and Blair.</p>",
  "<p>John Prescott opted for the <strong>BBC Radio 4 Today Programme</strong> to plug his BBC2 documentary on the British class system - plenty of targets there for Prescott's tirade against the posh. Defending his grammar school credentials, Today presenter Evan Davis attempted the obligatory Mandelson/yacht probe but Prescott was having none of it. \"Of all the big issues, you want to know what Prescott says about Mandelson and blah blah - you're so damn predictable,\" Prezza railed - <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_7692000/7692555.stm\">just after seven minutes into this audio clip</a>. \"If it's glass half full or half empty you'll always get the half empty one.

  "<p>As this long, long election campaign enters its final full week, John McCain faces an important choice, writes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/27/john-mccain-republicans-us-election\">Ewen MacAskill in the Guardian today</a>: accept the strong possibility that he's going to lose, and seek to be remembered as having fought to a dignified finish ... or throw everything he can at Obama in an all-out attempt to win. Publicly, of course, McCain won't admit the likelihood of defeat; yesterday he predicted a \"late night\" on November 4 - in which he would emerge triumphant - and spent the weekend painting Barack Obama as making a premature victory lap. (Sarah Palin's speeches on Saturday and Sunday echoed the theme.) \"This has been a very close race, and I believe I will win it,\" McCain said, seizing on a Reuters/Zogby poll that put him only five points behind Obama. But the centrepiece of McCain's weekend attack on Obama's presumptuousness faltered. The Republican accused his rival of having already written an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/27/us-election-transition-plans\">inauguration speech</a>, but turned out to be talking about a book chapter written by John Podesta - who heads Obama's transition team now, but who wrote it when he was still advising Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>In terms of the electoral map, McCain is now concentrating his money and time on <a href=\"http://www.freep.com/article/20081026/NEWS07/810260377\">Pennsyvlania</a>, in the hope that bringing home its 21 electoral college votes - which haven't gone to a Republican since 1988 - could offset potential losses in states such as Virginia. It will be a seriously uphill battle: polls give Obama a double-digit lead there. (Nate Silver, of the electoral projections blog FiveThirtyEight.com, suggests an alternative strategy <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/10/mccains-10-day-plan.html\">here</a>.) And if some conservatives get their way, he will have even fewer resources with which to wage it: yesterday one influential voice, the former Bush speechwriter <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/23/AR2008102302081.html?hpid=opinionsbox1?callitaweasel\">David Frum</a>, argued that it's now in Republican interests to cut McCain loose, switching every last dollar to Senate races in order to build a base from which the party can begin a post-election recovery.</p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>Both Obama and McCain are in Ohio then Pennsylvania today. At a speech in Ohio at 12.30pm eastern time, Obama will lay out his \"closing argument\": according to his campaign, he'll tell voters \"that after 21 months and three debates, Senator McCain still has not been able to tell the American people a single major thing he'd do differently from George Bush when it comes to the economy\".</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>That Reuters/Zogby poll notwithstanding, Obama seems to be maintaining his solid lead: an ABC/Washington Post poll puts the race at 52% to 45% among likely voters, while Gallup and Rasmussen tracking polls put it at 52%-43% and 52%-44%, a slight improvement for Obama and no change respectively.</p> <h2>Quotes of the weekend</h2> <p>\"If you're voting for the other guy, you should just wait until November 5.\" Barack Obama, speaking in Colorado, tries his hand at voter suppression. \"I'm just teasing,\" he added swiftly.</p> <p>\"Barack Obama and I both have spent quite some time on the basketball court.

  "<p>Barack Obama has enjoyed near-universal backing from American environmentalists, with the Sierra Club, the country's largest grass-roots environmental group, and Friends of the Earth US both endorsing the Democratic nominee for president.</p> <p>But there is one policy area in which Obama and the environmental lobby have increasingly grown apart: ethanol. As senator for the corn-growing state of Illinois, Obama has been a firm advocate of corn-based ethanol, 34 billion litres of which is now added to US petrol every year to reduce imports of foreign oil.</p> <p>Ethanol has been booming in the past two years across the corn heartlands of the US. But environmentalists are critical of the rush towards the fuel. They say its value as an alternative energy is debatable: one unit of energy expended in producing it gives less than two units of energy in the form of ethanol. Add to that the pressure on land use to grow more corn, and some analysts say its impact in terms of global warming emissions is actually negative.</p> <p>On top of that, ethanol has been blamed for contributing to the devastating global rise in food prices. The huge demand for corn to feed the 178 US distilleries that now pockmark the mid-west has diverted the supply from food markets and distorted international trade. About a third of American corn is now gobbled up by the industry, and the price of corn more than doubled to a peak of $5 (\u00a33.15) a bushel earlier this year.</p> <p>Yet Obama has continued to back the $33bn spent by the federal government every year to subsidise ethanol at the pump. The Republican presidential candidate, John McCain, by contrast, has said such subsidies should be removed; unlike Obama he also calls for a lifting of trade tariffs imposed on the importation of more efficient Brazilian ethanol drawn from sugar cane.</p> <p>The effect of the ethanol craze is visible on a drive across the Great Plains ending in the small town of Brownsville, Nebraska. The road passes through mile upon mile of flat land covered in nothing but rotting corn stalks after the harvest.</p> <p>Corky Jones is a fourth-generation Nebraskan farmer who grows corn and soya beans on a 970 hectare (2,400 acre) farm worked with his three sons. The ethanol bonanza has increased his yearly income by more than $500,000 just through the rise in corn prices. A long-term Democrat, his support for Obama has been strengthened by the senator's position on ethanol. </p> <p>\"Alternative energy is the cry of the land,\" he says. </p> <p>He also rejects criticism of the fuel as propoganda put about by the oil companies. \"The oil giants don't want to give up a drop of their oil to anybody else.\"</p> <p>The idea that the oil lobby is behind criticism of ethanol is shared by Roger Hill, who manages an ethanol plant in Craig, Missouri, about an hour's drive away. Here the corn is mashed, cooked and fermented, and then distilled into the alcohol that is ethanol.</p> <p>Hill is a life-time Republican. Though he agrees with Obama's position on ethanol, he says he still will not vote for the Democrat because he does not trust him to follow through on his promises. His distrust is intensified by his mistaken belief that Obama is a Muslim.</p> <p>Obama has softened his stance on ethanol slightly in recent weeks after his controversial support for it came under media scrutiny. He says he may now rethink the policy, although he has not yet withdrawn his backing.</p> <p>That puts environmentalists in a quandary in terms of their overall affinity for the Democratic candidate. Carl Pope, the national director of the Sierra Club, told the Guardian: \"I don't agree with his position on ethanol. But I think that once elected president he will do the learning that is required. He has some catching up to do.\"</p> <p>Obama may be spared an awkward confrontation over ethanol in any case. Federal requirements for the quantity of ethanol produced in 2008 have already been met, leading to a decline in demand.</p> <p>Rapidly falling oil prices in the wake of the Wall Street crash have further damaged demand for alternative fuels. Ethanol plants are struggling under reduced orders, and some have closed; with it the price of corn has also begun to decline. The ethanol bubble may be about to burst.</p>",

And she has broadened that appeal with the wholehearted embrace of children with special needs. Last week, in Colorado Springs, she said that along with running the nation's energy policy she wants to provide a White House lobby for children with special needs. This statement brought cheers from her conservative and Christian fundamentalist audience.</p> <p>Now, nobody doubts Palin's commitment to these kids on a personal level, but on inquiring into the vice-presidential candidate's position, our researcher Jean Casella discovered that while Palin says she advocates more help for children with special needs, she actually is opposed to spending more money on them.</p> <p>It goes like this: the McCain campaign and Palin herself advertise the VP candidate's commitment to children with special needs as ultimate proof of her anti-abortion credentials. Palin makes it clear that deciding to have a child she knew would have Down's syndrome was not just an admirable choice, but the only acceptable and moral choice - and if she had her way, it wouldn't be a choice at all.</p> <p>In an interview with <a href=\"http://blog.beliefnet.com/stevenwaldman/2008/10/the-amazing-palindobson-interv.html\">Focus on Family's James Dobson</a> in Colorado last week, she put it this way: \"I've always had near and dear to my heart the mission of protecting the sanctity of life and being pro-life, a hardcore pro-lifer, but I think this is an opportunity for me to really be walking the walk and not just talking the talk.\"</p> <p>A test of Palin's financial commitment to children with special needs came just a day after her series of rallies in Colorado. In an interview last Tuesday with a local television news programme, Palin was asked whether she supports a Colorado ballot measure called amendment 51, which would provide thousands of children and adults with autism, Down's syndrome, cerebral palsy and other disabilities with critically needed care, through a phased-in sales tax of 0.2% - which translates to 2 cents on every $10. The measure was prompted by the state's waiting list for such services, which now numbers more than 12,000, and has been championed by Colorado's former Republican first lady Frances Owens, who describes herself as a \"fiscal conservative\" and supports the McCain-Palin ticket.</p> <p>But Palin <a href=\"http://www.patriciaebauer.com/2008/10/21/palin-opposes-colorado-tax/\">opposes amendment 51.</a> She said: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"There's got to be an alternative to raising taxes. It's a matter of prioritising the dollars that are already there in government. What I did as governor of the state of Alaska was prioritise for a great increase in funding for our students with special needs up there. And I think that Colorado can do that also. And that is an issue near and dear to my heart. My nephew with autism, my son with Down's syndrome. I'm going to make sure that on a national level, too, that we prioritise to meet the needs of these special needs children. And the families will know that they have a friend and an advocate in the White House. Doesn't necessarily mean increasing taxes to meet those needs. It's all a matter of prioritising.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>It's hard to see how this could become a reality. McCain has sworn to an immediate government spending freeze. And Palin, in Colorado Springs, promised to cut taxes and balance the budget in one year. If past experience is any guide, all that means is cutting programmes affecting children with special needs.</p>",
  "<p>Even in her back yard, <strong>Sarah Palin</strong> has failed to win newspaper support.

  "<p>Thanks to politics as usual, Israel is once again headed for early elections. In the six decades since the state's establishment, Israel has had 31 different governments, and the elections now expected in February 2009 will be the fifth since the mid-1990s. It is therefore somewhat disingenuous to suggest that Kadima leader Tzipi Livni is looking \"<a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1031276.html\">like a loser</a>\" because she failed in her efforts to form a government. As many analysts have pointed out, Israel's political system based on pure proportional representation is not only \"chronically dysfunctional\", but has also depleted the country's political energies and <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/surveys/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10909941\">distorted its political forces</a> for decades. </p> <p>When Livni was appointed to form a government after her <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/19/israelandthepalestinians.middleeast\">narrow victory</a> in the Kadima primaries in mid-September, she apparently expected that it would not be too difficult to maintain the existing coalition of Kadima (29 seats), Labour (19), the Sephardi-ultra Orthodox Shas party (12), and the Pensioners' party (7), and perhaps add the left-wing Meretz party (5) that signalled its willingness to join. Such a coalition would have resulted in a stable government with a solid majority in the 120-seat Knesset that could have completed the two years remaining from the current government's term, and Livni was arguably right to suggest that this would be in the country's best interest. </p> <p>But after lengthy coalition negotiations, particularly with Shas, Livni reportedly <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1222017623111&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull\">told her advisers</a> that she was \"sick of this extortion\" \u2013 and given the spectacle of the past few weeks, this is a healthy reaction. A concise description of the coalition negotiations was offered by Meretz chairman Haim Oron, who <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1222017627575&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull\">observed sarcastically</a> that \"the fate of the people of Israel is determined between the morning prayer at [Shas spiritual leader] Rabbi Ovadia Yosef and [Labour chairman Ehud] Barak's respect-games.\" </p> <p>Labour leader Barak certainly earned little respect when <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1028992.html\">he insisted</a> in the coalition negotiations that he should have the rather meaningless title of \"senior deputy prime minister, second only to the prime minister\"; on the other hand, Shas chairman Eli Yishai <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1225036812825&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull\">conducted himself</a> just as anybody would have expected, insisting on large hand-outs to benefit his constituency and guarantees that there would be no offer to divide Jerusalem in the ongoing negotiations with the Palestinians. </p> <p>Livni emphasised in <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1031253.html\">her remarks</a> about her decision to seek early elections that it was a prime minister's duty \"to advance the interests of the state \u2026 Anyone willing to sell their principles for the prime minister's chair does not deserve to sit in it.\" In an apparent reference to reports that Likud chairman Benjamin Netanyahu had vowed to comply with Shas's demands if he is elected prime minister, she added: \"There are others who are willing to pay any price, but I am not willing to sell the state and its citizens only to become the prime minister.\" </p> <p>The bitter irony is that there is also a very real <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1031624.html\">price to be paid</a> for early elections, and the cost of the elections may turn out to be as high, and perhaps even higher, as the budget that would have been required to meet the demands of Shas for additional welfare payments. But since this is of course a time when all Israeli politicians are eager to present themselves as guardians of the nation's best interest, Shas insisted that it wasn't really the money that doomed the coalition talks, but rather the resolve not to sell Jerusalem for a few shekels.</p> <p>What impact Livni's failure to form a government and the resulting elections will have on the prospects for peace is obviously a question that is already being asked by many. The assessments are <a href=\"http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/LQ56785.htm\">generally pessimistic</a>, not least because most polls forecast a highly competitive race between Tzipi Livni and Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu, who is a sharp critic of the ongoing peace talks with the Palestinians. </p> <p>But even if Livni were to win the elections, it is far from certain that she would then be in a better position to form a government committed to the goal of negotiating a peace agreement. Given Israel's political system, it is very unlikely that the election results will produce a clear mandate, and the winner will once again have to cobble together a coalition of political forces with sharply divergent ideologies and narrow sectarian interests, producing yet another government that will be little suited to withstand the challenges involved in making historic decisions.</p>",

For instance, when reporting a story on the political <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/27/ethanol-barack-obama\">differences between Barack Obama and John McCain over ethanol</a> as an alternative fuel, you don't expect to be confronted with details of a plot by the devil to take over the White House.</p> <p>I had hopped on to the GuardianFilms bus <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/uselectionroadtrip\">as it made its way across the US</a>. We were joining forces to make a film about the ethanol issue, which has earned Obama the criticism of environmentalists because of his support for the controversial corn-based variety of the fuel that has helped to drive up world food prices.</p> <p>We stopped at an ethanol plant in Craig, Missouri, where we were greeted by the general manager, Roger Hill, and shown around the plant. He said something odd early on in our tour, responding to the news that I was British by commenting on how Muslims had become dominant in my country. I only half heard his remark, and let it go; we were here to talk about ethanol.</p> <p>Later though, he brought up the subject again, when I suggested to him that as an ethanol manufacturer he must logically back Obama over McCain, who has openly criticised federal subsidies of the fuel. That's when he invoked Revelations, chapter 13. If you lack instant recall of the contents of <a href=\"http://www.bartleby.com/108/66/13.html\">Revelations 13</a>, as I have to admit I did, it's the bit in the Bible where the beast rears his ugly head, or rather many heads, and reveals the mark on his right hand or forehead: 666.</p> <p>Yes, Hill was likening Obama to the devil, with Revelations 13 as the proof. Which gave me pause. I've heard many, many people tell me that Obama is a Muslim, but I'd never quite heard him compared to Satan.</p> <p>Back at the hotel we looked into it, and were surprised to find that the Obama-as-devil conspiracy theory is <a href=\"http://www.topix.com/forum/city/liberty-ky/TTNDMEHF2F7OO9N1K\">rife on the internet</a>. Tap in Obama and Revelations 13 into Google and 904,000 entries come up. This is insidious stuff. And it jumps out at you when you least expect it. Even in an ethanol plant in the Great Plains.</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/kevglobal/2970027601/\">Oil well in Western Kansas</a> by <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/kevglobal/\">Kevin Anderson</a>, <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/deed.en\">Some rights Reserved</a></p> <p>Traveling through Kansas was a bit of a homecoming for me. My first journalism job was in Hays Kansas, a town of 20,000 in western Kansas. I was the regional reporter and covered nine counties, some 1100 square miles, and my editor was Mike Corn. I sat down with Mike to get a sense of how the election was playing here in western Kansas.</p> <p><strong>'Don't treat these farmers like they're stupid'</strong></p> <p>I still remember the first time I met Mike. Saying that first impressions were important, my father made me wear a tie. It was out of character then as much as it is now. Mike usually wore jeans to work and often wore work or cowboy boots. It was sensible when you might have to walk out into a farmer's field to interview him. Mike took one look at me, and said, \"Don't you treat these farmers like they're stupid.\"</p> <p>Farming is a tough business, and western Kansas has never been forgiving for farmers. Almost no rain fell the last six months I was there. It was drier than the terrible <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/dustbowl/timeline/index.html\">Dust Bowl</a> years during the Depression. I interviewed people who remembered the Dust Bowl. They talked about hanging wet towels over the windows and stuffing them under the doors to keep the dust from blowing into their homes. Cattle died from suffocation, their lungs fouled with dust.</p> <p>Changes in plowing, water conservation and wind breaks prevented any major dust storms when I was there, but there were dust storms, which were fortunately nothing like on the scale of the Dirty 30s. The dry period was broken in a dramatic way when a fierce storm with 90 mph winds rolled out of the Rockies and dumped several inches of rain in a half hour.</p> <p>To make a living in farming, farmers had to work smarter to beat the harse conditions and survive in the brutal global market. Even in 1995 when I was in Kansas, farmers often had satellite dishes providing up-to-date weather radar and forecasts as well as the latest commodity information. Many of the farmers had masters degrees in agricultural economics.</p> <p><strong>Western Kansas economy booming</strong></p> <p>While the economy has been reeling in many of the places where we've traveled, western Kansas has been an exception, Mike said, adding, \"primarily thanks to oil and agriculture.\" While Texas and Alaska get all of the attention in terms of oil, Hays sits in the middle of the richest oil patch in Kansas. With the rise in oil prices, Mike said there has been a dramatic increase in new wells \"to the point that with some of the major services like drilling, there is a two-month waiting period\".</p> <p>Hays is primarily dry-land farming. Further west, farmers irrigate, drawing on the vast <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogallala_Aquifer\">Ogallala Acquifer</a>, but Hays has few groundwater sources. Most of the farmers grow wheat or grass, crops more tolerant to the dry conditions. Last year, wheat prices spiked to <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/money/markets/2008-02-05-wheat-ten-dollars_N.htm\">$10 a bushel</a>, a record high price. \"Last year was probably the best year ever (for agriculture) in western Kansas,\" he said.</p> <p>Housing prices also didn't rise as much as they did in places like Florida, Arizona and California. With a robust economy and moderate house prices, the economy in <a href=\"http://search.everyzing.com/viewMedia.jsp?dedupe=1&amp;index=10&amp;num=10&amp;col=en-all-public-ep&amp;e=19758558&amp;s=PZSID_0000010512;KCUR+News&amp;start=0&amp;channelTitle=stock&amp;expand=true&amp;match=query,channel&amp;bc=42,41,40&amp;filter=0\">western Kansas is better than in much of the US</a>.</p> <p>That doesn't mean that clouds aren't on the horizon. Oil and wheat prices have dropped more than 50% off of their highs. Some people are worried that farmers may not be able to meet the cost of production this year, Mike said. \"Now, with prices dropping so precipitously, we're looking at the makings of a disaster with rising land values and with increased debt because of equipment and commodity prices coming below the cost of production. Input costs continue to go up, even though fuel costs are down marginally,\" he said.</p> <p><strong>Western Kansas politics</strong></p> <p>Kansas has the reputation as a bastion of social conservatism, largely because of a high-profile battle over the <a href=\"http://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/03/08/creationism.vs.evolution/\">teaching of creationism in the state's schools</a>. While it's fair to say that Kansas is generally conservative, the social conservatives are primarily in the eastern half of the state, especially in the suburbs of Kansas City Kansas, in places like <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=AJKrMcOyQ3wC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=Olathe+Kansas+bastion+conservatism&amp;source=web&amp;ots=AEvZyFYlAm&amp;sig=1wpOJa-WsNtwUcE0Vd9ZOh-kNuU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result#PPA104,M1\">Olathe and Shawnee</a>. Western Kansas is more in line with the Western-style, libertarian strain of conservatism.</p> <p>In western Kansas, it is a more \"leave us alone, we're out here\" brand of Republican politics, Mike said. Mike repeatedly drew a distinction between a Kansas agenda and a 'coastal' agenda.</p> <p>I asked him how the agendas differed. \"We take care of our own. We don't want our views to always influence our next-door neighbours or the person a mile down the road. If they want to believe a certain way, more power to them,\" he said. It's a live-and-let-live style of conservatism.</p> <p>How will this influence the election? Although the economy has been strong in western Kansas, Mike still believes the economy will be the major issue on voters' minds \"only because it is the talk of the day\".</p> <p>\"They will vote for the candidate who can stem the tide before it gets here,\" Mike said.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-339025590\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>American helicopters flying from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq\">Iraq</a> landed inside Syria yesterday and dropped special forces who killed eight people, the Damascus government said last night, as Washington admitted it had targeted \"foreign fighters.\"</p> <p>Syria warned that it held the US \"wholly responsible for this act of aggression and all its repercussions\". </p> <p>It described the dead as Syrian civilians, five of them members of the same family. Syrian state television reported that the attack was against a farm near Abu Kamal, five miles from the Iraqi border. Doctors in nearby al-Sukkariya said another seven people were taken to hospital with bullet wounds.</p> <p>The incident threatened to unleash a new wave of anti-American feeling in Syria and across the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast\">Middle East</a> at a time when President Bashar al-Assad, already being courted by Europe, is looking forward to improved relations with Washington after the November 4 presidential election. News of the attack led bulletins across the Arab world last night - suggesting it will have wide resonance.</p> <p>Syria summoned the US charge d'affaires in Damascus to explain the incident. It also called on the Iraqi government to prevent its airspace being used in this way in future.</p> <p>Eyewitness accounts said eight US soldiers landed in two helicopters and that the dead were building workers. A senior Syrian source quoted by the official Sana news agency, said four helicopters violated Syrian airspace and described the target as a \"civilian building under construction\".</p> <p>In Washington an unnamed military official told the Associated Press the raid had targeted elements of a \"foreign fighter logistics network\", and that, due to Syrian inaction, the US was \"taking matters into our own hands\". It was the first known American attack on Syrian soil.</p> <p>Intriguingly, Farhan al-Mahalawi, mayor of the nearby Iraqi border town of Qaim, told the Reuters news agency that the targeted village had been surrounded by Syrian troops.</p> <p>In Israel, a security official said Israel was not involved. Last year Israel destroyed an alleged nuclear site in northern Syria. Qaim has been a significant crossing point for foreign fighters, weapons and money entering Iraq to fuel the Sunni insurgency.</p> <p>Only last Thursday, the commander of US forces in western Iraq told reporters American troops were redoubling efforts to secure the Syrian border. Major General John Kelly said Iraq's western borders with Saudi Arabia and Jordan were fairly tight as a result of good policing by security forces in those countries, but that Syria was a \"different story\".</p> <p>Thabet Salem, a political analyst, told al-Jazeera TV that the US appeared to have mistaken building workers for infiltrators. \"It will raise questions as to why this is happening towards the end of the current US administration,\" he said.</p> <p>Late last year the then US commander, General David Petraeus, praised Syria's cooperation in reducing violence in Iraq. But Syria has since refused to restart intelligence sharing with the US until Washington recognises its assistance by returning an ambassador to Damascus.</p> <p>Joshua Landis, an American expert on Syria, commented last night: \"The Bush administration must assume that an Obama victory will force Syria to behave nicely in order to win favour with the new administration. Thus White House analysts may assume that it can have a \"freebee\" - taking a bit of personal revenge on Syria without the US paying a price.\"</p> <p>The attack comes as Syria takes another step in from the cold today when its foreign minister, Walid al-Mualim, visits London to hear praise for its newly conciliatory policies in Lebanon - and to be urged to distance itself from Iran.</p> <p>In recent months Syria has established diplomatic relations with Lebanon and held several rounds of indirect talks with Israel, with Turkey acting as broker. In July, President Assad was invited to an EU summit in Paris.</p>",
  "<p>This election isn't over for another eight days and the next one is four years away, but the question being asked with some urgency is: will Sarah Palin run for president in 2012?</p> <p>A faint, but audible, chant can be heard among her supporters, to paraphrase the oil drilling mantra on the campaign trail: \"Run, baby, run!\" They see her as the leader to steer the conservative movement out of its malaise, a politician who can excite the party faithful in a mirror image of what Barack Obama did for the Democrats.</p> <p>Should Obama win on November 4, and many conservatives are resigned to that, the chorus is likely to grow. But so too will the voices of opposition, with their own Palin chant: \"Get back to Alaska!\" </p> <p>Here too the rumblings are audible. Over the weekend, advisers to the Republican presidential candidate, John McCain, were briefing more than one news outlet that Palin was \"going rogue\", pursuing her own political interests with an eye on 2012 rather than concentrating on McCain's stab at the top job.</p> <p>\"She is a diva,\" one unnamed adviser told CNN. \"She is playing for her own future and sees herself as the next leader of the party.\" The Politico website carried the views of other anonymous McCain aides who attacked Palin for being \"green\", sloppy and incomprehensibly willing to criticise McCain for his campaign strategy.</p> <p>Palin has recently broken with the McCain campaign on several points. She has publicly chided the decision to abandon the race in Michigan and questioned why Obama's controversial former pastor, Jeremiah Wright, has been treated as out of bounds.</p> <p>Such outspokenness is just one way in which Palin has divided opinion across the country. She has emerged as a singularly charismatic but also divisive politician, splitting the electorate into those who see her as the epitome of small-town America or small-minded America.</p> <p>That division cuts deep within the conservative movement and reflects a basic disagreement over the future direction of the Republican party. In the soul-searching that would follow a McCain defeat much of the debate may centre on the personality of Palin.</p> <p>Rich Lowry, editor of the conservative National Review, is an admirer of Palin who thinks she will stand for president in 2012. \"She has a window, as a rock star of the right. She's been given an opportunity in terms of national exposure and high name recognition that many ambitious politicians would kill for,\" he told the Guardian.</p> <p>Lowry first met Palin in August last year when a group of senior National Review pundits went to visit her in Juneau, capital of Alaska, on a cruise organised by the magazine. An earlier cruise earned her the admiration of influential figures from Rupert Murdoch's Weekly Standard including William Kristol, who also writes for the New York Times, and the magazine's editor Fred Barnes. Other important Palin advocates include the talkshow host Rush Limbaugh, several presenters on Murdoch's Fox News and leading members of her Christian evangelical alliance.</p> <p>In the opposing corner are other conservatives, notably Kristol's fellow New York Times columnist David Brooks who sees the Alaskan governor as part of a drift within the movement towards anti-intellectualism. \"Once conservatives admired Churchill and Lincoln above all - men who prepared for leadership through constant reading, historical understanding and sophisticated thinking,\" he has written referring to Palin. \"Now those attributes bow down before the common touch.\"</p> <p>The image of Palin as anti-intellectual emerged partly as a result of her disastrous TV interviews in which she was unable to answer such simple questions as which newspapers she reads, and partly as a result of the lampooning of Tina Fey on Saturday Night Live. Palin has also courted the persona, accentuating her rustic accent on the campaign trail and talking disparagingly about Obama's \"elitism\".</p> <p>Michael Franc, an expert in government relations at the conservative Heritage Foundation thinktank, thinks Palin has thrown into relief a crucial post-election debate for Republicans: should they continue on the populist path laid by Ronald Reagan, or aggressively expand their support base in the interests of electoral success.</p> <p>\"The problem is that Palin's populism appeals to only 45% of the electorate at most and something has to change to get the party back up above 50%\" he said. Demographic changes in America have seen the rise of an electoral group of highly educated professionals repelled by populist arguments and open to Democratic advances, Franc added. Palin must appeal to them if she is serious about standing in 2012.</p> <p>Lowry agreed that to have a serious shot at the White House Palin has to fill out her political profile.</p> <p>\"If she tries to float by on her celebrity and charm she will squander the great opportunity she has been given. But if she bones up on what Sarah Palin conservatism means, then she will be a formidable contender,\" he said.</p> <p>The other priority for 2012 would be to keep her profile high - not an easy task from the media wilderness of Alaska. Help is likely to be at hand from media outlets keen to embrace her celebrity. </p> <p>But a media career may also work against her search for seriousness, said Robert Thompson, professor of popular culture at Syracuse University. \"She needs to build up her political gravitas which she has seemed to lack, and doing a TV talk show may not be the best way,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>John McCain shrugged aside daunting poll figures yesterday to claim he was placed to win next week's presidential election even as an inquest was beginning inside the Republican party.</p> <p>Interviewed on NBC's Meet the Press, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">McCain</a> dismissed the polls that showed huge leads for Barack Obama and said he sensed the race tightening.</p> <p>The Republican presidential nominee predicted a \"late night\" next Tuesday, suggesting the voting would be close enough to have to wait for the final counts in some states. \"This has been a very close race, and I believe I will win it,\" he said.</p> <p>But in a sign of how much of a mismatch the campaign has become, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Obama</a>, speaking on Saturday in Albuquerque, New Mexico - won in 2004 by George Bush - attracted a crowd of 45,000. McCain, speaking in the same city the same day drew only about 1,500 onlookers.</p> <p>Some Republicans, breaking with the convention of staying silent until the votes are in, are already dissecting his campaign strategy and acknowledging openly they believe the race to be lost.</p> <p>A blame-game has begun among McCain staff over responsibility for strategic blunders, in particular the confused and often conflicting messages the campaign has sent out over the past two months.</p> <p>At McCain's campaign headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, demoralised staff and volunteers at the weekend listened in near-silence to invocations from senior campaign figures saying all was not lost.</p> <p>David Frum, Bush's speechwriter, who wrote the Axis of Evil speech, suggested yesterday, in an opinion-piece for the Washington Post, that the party shifted resources from the presidential race \"that is almost certainly lost\" to senate ones so that there would be a base on which to build a Republican revival after the election. \"A beaten party needs a base from which to recover,\" Frum wrote.</p> <p>Mark McKinnon, a former McCain campaign adviser, wrote for the Daily Beast website: \"The most popular parlour game in Washington DC these days is the bludgeoning of the McCain campaign.\" </p> <p>McKinnon said the McCain strategist Steve Schmidt, said to be behind the character attacks on Obama, and colleagues, had run a good campaign and \"taken McCain further than he had any reasonable right to, given the political climate\".</p> <p>He added that the election \"ain't over yet\" and that McCain might \"have a couple of barrel rolls left\".</p> <p>In another blow to McCain's campaign yesterday, the largest paper in Alaska, Sarah Palin's home state, endorsed Obama. The Anchorage Daily News said McCain had \"stumbled and fumbled badly\" in his response to the economic crisis and Palin was not ready to be vice-president. </p> <p>McCain now faces an important decision on the final days of the campaign. If he does assume he will lose he may want to be remembered as having fought a dignified race in the end - or he could throw everything at Obama. </p> <p>Yesterday he pounced on a Reuters/Zogby poll which put him only 5 points behind Obama (who is on 49%), saying that was evidence that the race was closer than indicated by other polls giving Obama double-digit leads.</p> <p>Obama, back on the trail after visiting his ailing grandmother in Hawaii, picked up on a comment by McCain, on Meet the Press, in which he had said he shared a common philosophy with Bush. Speaking in Denver, Obama, who has sought to tie McCain down as a continuation of Bush, said: \"I guess that was John McCain finally giving us a little straight talk, and owning up to the fact that he and George Bush actually have a whole lot in common.\" </p> <p>In Pennsylvania, Republicans are distancing themselves from an email sent to Jewish voters comparing a vote for Obama with the events of the 1930s leading to the Holocaust. The email warns of a \"second holocaust\" if Obama were elected, portraying him as a danger to Israel.</p>",
  "<p>Old hands talk of a Middle Eastern version of Murphy's law: what can go wrong, does - and usually at the worst possible moment. Tzipi Livni's failure to form a new coalition led by her Kadima party shows it is at work again.</p> <p>Confirmation of early elections in Israel follows several developments that had generated cautious optimism: one is the likelihood that Barack Obama will be the next US president and will make good on his pledge to prioritise talks to resolve the world's most intractable conflict.</p> <p>Another is renewed interest in the 2002 Arab peace initiative that offers Israel normal relations with all Arab states if - and that remains a very big \"if\" - it can reach a just settlement with the Palestinians. </p> <p>The third positive element has been the repeated readiness of Syria to pursue negotiations with Israel over the Golan Heights - one of the reasons its foreign minister, Walid al-Muallem, is meeting his British counterpart, David Miliband, in London today.</p> <p>The reason Livni's failure casts such a dark cloud is that polls consistently show the frontrunner in the election is Binyamin \"Bibi\" Netanyahu, leader of the right-wing Likud opposition. </p> <p>Netanyahu, who like Livni would have to form a coalition with other parties, does not believe in the sort of peace with the Palestinians that Kadima and its Labour party ally are prepared, in principle at least, to agree to. </p> <p>The Likud will resist any re-partition of Jerusalem, a key issue for Palestinians. Netanyahu opposed the 2005 withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and calls for economic development for the Palestinian Authority before negotiations over territory. Ideologically, the Likud is close to the thousands of Israeli settlers who would have to be evacuated if a land-for-peace deal with the Palestinians could be cobbled together.</p> <p>Netanyahu's approach, with his emphasis on fighting \"terror\", contrasts with the swelling chorus of mainstream Arab and Israeli voices warning that time for a two-state solution is running out. Indeed, many believe it has already gone.</p> <p>But Israel's tangled internal politics are not the only problem. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, is also in a desperately weak position. </p> <p>Hamas warns it will cease recognition of Abbas as president after next January, when his term is due to end. Abbas does not want new elections until 2010. Egypt is trying to broker a compromise between the factions, but hopes of success are slim.</p> <p>A Palestinian spokesman says Israel's turbulent domestic politics are its internal affair, and insists the PA is committed to negotiations with whoever is in charge. But no one doubts that a focus on elections - whatever the outcome - is bad news for an already near-moribund peace process.</p> <p>As the Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said from Gaza City yesterday: \"The call for early elections and Livni's failure to form a coalition government is a slap in the face to those who still dream of negotiations.\"</p>",
  "<p>After the devastating turn of foot shown by Crowded House in the final Group One of the domestic Flat season on Saturday, the winter virtues of courage and doggedness were showcased by yesterday's Old Roan Chase at Aintree. The first race of the jump season's Order of Merit competition drew a quality field of familiar names, all of which were beaten by the unflashy Knowhere, who slogged to victory through the mud.</p> <p>One of the first off the bridle, Knowhere looked a most unlikely winner as Paul Nicholls' Galway Plate hero Oslot went to the front after the second-last. But Nicholls had warned that his charge might be lacking in fitness and it showed as the six-year-old hit the wall and faded quickly. By contrast, Knowhere kept responding to the urgings of Paddy Brennan and outbattled Exotic Dancer, who was conceding 18lb, on the run-in.</p> <p>\"I knew if it was a war, I'd win. I was half a length down at the last but I didn't have to hit him,\" said Brennan. \"The horse never gives in. It's brilliant for the yard and we'll try and win the Hennessy [on November 29] now.\"</p> <p>Exotic Dancer will also have a Hennessy entry, but trainer Jonjo O'Neill, who expressed himself \"delighted\" with the run, said the gelding was more likely to be aimed at Haydock's Betfair Chase, in which he was narrowly beaten by Kauto Star last year. Voy Por Ustedes also put up a fine weight-carrying performance in fourth and will now go straight to the King George on Boxing Day.</p> <p>The disappointment of yesterday's race was Cloudy Lane, last seen running sixth in the Grand National as joint-favourite, but never going on his return to Aintree, finishing last. Ginger McCain, father of his trainer, Donald, was unruffled, describing the outing as \"just a prep\" for next month's Becher Chase over the National fences.</p> <p>Aidan O'Brien's attempt to break the world record of 25 Group One wins in a year is still alive following victory for Yeats in the Prix Royal-Oak at Longchamp yesterday.

After plying his trade in top handicap events in recent years, Kevin Ryan's sprinter only went down by a head at Windsor last Monday, but can go one better over a track and trip that brought him a win in 2006.

  "<p>At a recent charity dinner, a rare moment in the campaign when the two US presidential candidates traded self-deprecating jokes rather than insults, Barack Obama denied he was born in a manger. He revealed he came from Krypton and had been sent by his father Jor-El, to save planet Earth. The joke contained a serious thought: the Democrat was acknowledging that after the worst US presidency in living memory, the world's expectations of an Obama administration were so inflated as to beg failure.</p> <p>The next president's in-tray is already full to overflowing. Consider the events of this weekend alone: in Kabul a private security guard working for the shipping company DHL shot dead the director and deputy of his firm, a Briton and a South African; in Ghazni, south-west of Kabul, officials investigated reports that 20 security guards had been killed in a US airstrike; in Pakistan, a full-scale war raged against the Pakistani Taliban in Bajaur; in Baghdad, the Iraqi cabinet yesterday cancelled a meeting to discuss the status of US forces in the country; in Israel, Tzipi Livni, foreign minister and linchpin of the negotiations with the Palestinians announced she could not form a coalition government, and would have to go to the country. On current polling, an election in February would be won by the hawkish Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu. Four active conflicts and a world recession are a large enough bequest - even for superman.</p> <p>Afghanistan is the elephant in the room. Military commanders today make little secret of their belief that the campaign is not working. Some question whether more troops will improve matters. General David Petraeus, the architect of the surge in Iraq who is now running US Central Command is said to doubt whether the template he used for Iraq will work in Afghanistan. A larger toolbox of policies is needed to cope with a corrupt central government in Kabul surrounded by a belt of mini-emirates in the provinces. Engaging elements of the Taliban will rank high on any to-do list.</p> <p>Iraq leaves both presidential candidates with major challenges, as a paper by one of Petraeus's former advisers, the Middle East analyst Toby Dodge, makes clear. John McCain, who began his campaign saying he did not mind if US troops were in Iraq for the next 100 years but has since tempered his rhetoric, will be troubled by the sustainability of the security gains made during the surge of US troops. The problems come from the top. Nouri al-Maliki's use of Iraq's army for personal political gain will cause increasing problems to the US, whose policy is predicated on improving the capacity of the Iraqi state, not just its prime minister. The tensions inherent in trying to incorporate 103,000 Sunnis in the al-Sahwa, or Awakening, who rose up against al-Qaida, into a Shia-led army are also fierce. Mr Obama is not spared difficulty. The commitment to withdrawing all combat troops in 16 months is the central plank of his campaign. The question is how he can learn the lessons of the last time this was tried by US General George Casey in 2006.</p> <p>Unlike Mr McCain, Mr Obama has no shortage of advisers: 500 at the last count. Colin Powell may have wanted to exorcise the ghosts of the UN speech where he presented \"evidence\" of Saddam's weapons of mass destruction by throwing his lot in with Mr Obama last week. There are also Tony Lake, Susan Rice, Richard Holbrooke - all possible secretaries of state - and Joe Biden, chairman of the senate foreign relations committee, whose choice as running mate was a sign that Mr Obama was thinking ahead. But Mr Obama's biggest foreign policy asset will be himself. At points in the campaign where he was tested - such as the surfacing of incendiary videos of his former pastor the Rev Jeremiah Wright - Mr Obama showed what has been described as a gut steadiness. As US president and world leader that quality will be in demand as never before.</p>",
  "<p>There are three Ps in this particular odd pod: John Prescott, Sarah Palin and Parody. If you want to add a fourth P, then that's Politics, of course - and politicians' own, stumbling notion of why stereotypical voters jump to attention. Turn on Prescott: the Class System and Me tonight and see for yourself.</p> <p>John P would be a dream candidate over the pond: a Rocky from the wrong side of the tracks who does policies as well as punches, a railway signalman's son who pulled himself up by his bootstraps and now drives two fat, flash cars (unlike John McCain, who has 13). But this is Britain, so there's scant wonder or admiration in sight as he struts and complains for the cameras. He thinks the class warriors have done him down. He didn't succeed; he was jeered, derided and generally scoffed at by toffs. </p> <p>\"Mine's a gin and tonic, Giovanni,\" called Nicholas Soames in the House of Commons dining room, and the old ship's steward glowered, just as he glowers today over Cherie the (alleged) snob and other slights. In America, he'd be an instant \"real American\", blue collar turned up against the cold, working Pittsburgh, Detroit and Scranton for votes - a Joe Biden sort of bloke specialising in shorter, unfinished sentences. But then, as we've seen these last few days, there's another \"real\" America out there, a land of picket fences, hockey moms, small-town values and smaller horizons; the America that Palin courts while she snarls at big cities where liberals, socialists and terrorists live. </p> <p>But here comes the parody. Palin - thanks to big city comedians - has emerged as (or perhaps always was) a figure of fun. And Prescott's 10 years as deputy prime minister, in charge of the ship of state while Cap'n Tony and Toffee Nose relaxed in Tuscany, ended in a mixture of French farce and Whitehall comedy, all lost trousers and seedy gags. Palin and Prescott share a parallel plight: they are both the butts of people who feel themselves cleverer, more educated, more worldly wise. But they are also labels their parties seek to wear with pride.</p> <p>In fact, of course, it is mostly an act - certainly in Prescott's case. He didn't get to Ruskin College, Oxford, or Hull University, by playing the fool. He didn't work his way up through the National Union of Seamen, into Strasbourg as an MEP, into Westminster, into the cabinet, into august omnipotence, without a very sharp brain and tongue. He was formidable, especially in opposition. His own stereotype sells him pitifully short. Yet he was obliged to bluster round in that spin-doctored part because New Labour thought it needed a \"real\" working-class hero on board to show where its roots still lay. There were auditions for the role of rude mechanical; he was just the job. </p> <p>And the question now - raised most pungently this evening as Mr P sits in a cafe with three young, appealing Lewisham chavs, girls who have never heard of Gordon Brown, let alone Tony Blair - is whether that role retains any resonance. The cry from the pollsters and spin doctors is a familiar one: Labour has lost touch with its \"core\" support, the working class Prescott was supposed to symbolise. But here one chatty chav says she's middle class \"because I don't work\" - and Prezza scratches his bemused head benignly.</p> <p>These aren't Coronation Street castoffs pretending to represent the great in a tabloid old Britain. Nor are they class climbers who'd love to inspect the new loo in Prescott Towers before taking a spin in his Jag. They're different - feisty, intelligent, unstructured, citizens of what we call an underclass because we haven't found a way of including them in something more cohesive. They are a challenge, not a stereotype. They party but know no party.</p> <p>Prescott talks balefully of his decade with Cunard, waiting bar and table for the nobs. But cruises these days are ten a penny, and the waiters are Poles or Slovaks or Tunisians - just as the waiters in his favourite Hull restaurant are Chinese. Oleg Deripaska wouldn't let Prezza near his yacht.</p> <p>Is Prescott man with Prescott values the way to reach Labour's damaged core, as some shivering analysts contend? No way: he's sharp and he's sympathetic, but still a parody construct. Is Palin, too, the way to heartland America's heart? Nope: she's more destruct than construct, a confection actually shedding votes from Ohio to Missouri. You'll enjoy class with the Prescotts tonight, for sure. But just remember that the real, real world has moved on.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:p.preston@theguardian.com\">p.preston@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>As the sun rose over Soweto on South Africa's first democratic election in 1994, the Mwale family were too busy with practical matters to ponder the historical resonance of the day.</p> <p>Following rumours that a white supremacist group was going to poison the main water tank, they boiled the water and cooked a huge pot of mealies. The day before, during early voting, granny had waited seven hours to cast her ballot for Nelson Mandela and the kids had to bring her food. Now it would be granny's turn to come to the rescue.</p> <p>I recall walking with the mother of the house, Esther Mwale, in silence at 7am through zone 9 of Meadowlands, the morning fog slowly lifting to reveal that people had ironed their best trousers and put on their sturdiest shoes for the day. All dressed up for democracy.</p> <p>The two hours Esther spent queueing to vote somehow served as a dignified, humane response to the horrors of apartheid. After his wife, Ruth First, was killed by the regime, African National Congress militant Joe Slovo said: \"The most effective punishment is to force those who did it to live in a democratic South Africa.\" And here it was.</p> <p>But if long lines of black people at polling stations showed the promise of a fledgling democracy in South Africa, the prospect of similar scenes next week will illustrate a failing democracy in the US. A longstanding, systematic, legal and political campaign to suppress the vote in Democratic areas combined with the shambolic, shameful neglect of the electoral infrastructure could yet cause chaos on an unprecedented scale. </p> <p>In short, come next Tuesday, the issue may not so much be who votes for whom, but who gets to vote and whose votes get counted. A recent CNN poll showed that 42% of voters are not confident their vote will be accurately cast and counted - almost three times the figure four years ago. With the record numbers of newly registered voters will be a record number of lawyers on both sides. If it's close, the courts may once again pick the winner.</p> <p>The popular response to such an unpopular outcome is not difficult to imagine. According to the Washington magazine The Hill, police across the country are preparing for unrest. Swat teams will be on standby in Oakland, California. The Democratic secretary of state in Ohio now has protection from death threats after she refused to make a list of 200,000 newly registered voters available to Republicans.</p> <p>Some of this mayhem stems from a noxious blend of officiousness and incompetence. In Jackson County, West Virginia, people have been hitting the touch-screen for Barack Obama and finding they have voted for John McCain. In Florida they are testdriving the third ballot system in three election cycles. Election workers are struggling. Those who thought they would vote early and avoid the queues are waiting in line for three hours. </p> <p>Added to the technological flaws with machines and lack of technical training for those operating them are technocratic electoral laws that aren't fair, don't work and in any case aren't being heeded. According to the New York Times, tens of thousands of eligible voters in six battleground states have been illegally removed from voter rolls or will be prevented from voting in ways that violate federal law. In Wisconsin, one in five voters' names on the registration database did not completely match names on other state records, including four of the six former judges charged with overseeing the elections. Both presidential candidates may have been wasting their time wooing Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher - aka Joe the plumber - at the last debate. He is registered as Worzelbacher, and therefore may find himself ineligible to vote. </p> <p>While this is happening everywhere (Jackson county is 98% white and voted for Bush in the last two elections), it is compounded by a protracted Republican effort to disenfranchise Democratic voters under the guise of combating voter fraud. Voter fraud is a serious issue. The trouble is it barely exists. In the six years since the Bush administration has made it a priority, barely 100 people have been convicted and fewer than 200 have been charged. The overwhelming majority were either people who thought they were eligible but weren't (immigrants, felons etc) or those registering fictitious people. </p> <p>\"If they found a single case of a conspiracy to affect the outcome of a Congressional election or a statewide election, that would be significant,\" Richard Hasen, election law expert at the Loyola Law School, told the New York Times last year. \"But what we see is isolated, small-scale activities that often have not shown any kind of criminal intent.\"</p> <p>But that hasn't stopped Republicans trying. Five of the 12 US attorneys who were fired last year, in the scandal that led to the resignation of US attorney general Alberto Gonzales, were axed because they refused to pursue the issue of voter fraud with sufficient vigour. It also explains the Republican attacks on the community group Acorn, which pays people to register voters in low income and minority areas. Some of Acorn's workers made up names. That should be and has been condemned. But there is no evidence that it has resulted in a single fraudulent vote ever being cast since Acorn began its large-scale voter registration drives four years ago. </p> <p>While attempts at voter suppression are partisan in intent they are racial in effect. The Democrats have not won an election without the black vote since 1964. The most effective and crude way to undermine their base is to minimise the vote in black areas. This is precisely what happened in Florida in 2000, where Republicans lowered the threshold for inclusion on the \"purge list\" of ineligible voters. By the time they were done, African-Americans accounted for 88% of those purged, even though they only comprised 11% of the actual electorate. </p> <p>The practical consequences of this interference, manipulation and, at times, intimidation is twofold. It disenfranchises people who either don't have the time, inclination or wherewithal to stand up to officialdom. And it creates huge lines while others stay and fight. A Democratic party survey from 2004 found half of the state's African-American voters in Ohio reported some problems at the polls on election day. On average, black voters waited in longer lines than whites, were more likely to be asked for identification when they got there and felt more intimidated. </p> <p>This year will be worse. Obama's strategy has hinged on registering huge numbers of new voters. Overrepresented among them are the black, the young and first-time voters. For at least six months this eventuality has been predictable. And yet electoral officers around the country have declared themselves entirely unprepared. Just as in South Africa 14 years ago, the huge turnout we are seeing in early voting, and which will undoubtedly come on election day, marks a celebration of a historic moment in the nation's democracy. But the long lines and their demographic composition will mark not dignity but disorganisation and discrimination.</p> <p>It remains one of the paradoxes of this election that black America may yet get a president before black Americans have fully secured their right to vote.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:g.younge@theguardian.com\">g.younge@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Monday October 27 2008.

  "<p>John McCain accused Barack Obama of making a premature \"victory lap\", following reports that the Democratic candidate's backroom team was deciding key staff jobs in the White House and that an Obama draft speech had been completed for his inauguration on January 20.</p> <p>McCain has several times in the past few weeks claimed Obama was being over-confident and presumptuous, behaving as if the election on November 4 was a done deal. Speaking at the weekend, the presidential nominee for the Republican party joked that when Obama lost he would ask him to \"save that manuscript of this inaugural address and donate it to the Smithsonian\".</p> <p>McCain added that the Smithsonian Institution should put the speech \"right next to the Chicago paper that said 'Dewey Defeats Truman'\".</p> <p>Bill Burton, a spokesman for Obama, described the writing of such a speech as completely false. \"There is no draft of an inaugural speech,\" he said.</p> <p>Obama has had a transition team in place for months, led by John Podesta, who was Bill Clinton's chief of staff and is now head of the liberal Washington think-tank Centre for American Progress. The team is engaged in talks with potential candidates for key jobs, including those of White House chief of staff, secretary of state and secretary of the treasury.</p> <p>Podesta dismissed McCain's jibes on an inaugural speech, saying the confusion had occurred over a chapter he had written for a book with ideas presented in the form of an inaugural address. The book was written in the spring and published in the summer before Podesta began working for Obama. \"No one involved in pre-transition work has written one word of any address, inaugural or otherwise,\" Podesta said.</p> <p>McCain, despite his attack on the Democratic presidential candidate, has got a team in place, too; led by John Lehman, the navy secretary under Ronald Reagan.</p> <p>Both presidential campaigns, in fact, set up their transition teams quite late, laying themselves open to charges that they were being slow with crucial planning.</p> <p>The period between November 4 and the inauguration on January 20 is awkward as power shifts to the incoming president. Announcements are then made within this transition period about who will fill the top jobs.</p> <p>Among potential candidates being sounded out for a place in an Obama administration as secretary of state is Richard Holbrooke, the veteran diplomat who was involved in brokering the Dayton agreement that helped end hostilities in Bosnia. Obama has met him several times and likes him, according to aides, though there are differences over foreign policy.</p> <p>Obama's endorsement by George Bush's former secretary of state, Colin Powell, also puts the latter into the mix. Others are Richard Lugar, a Republican senator - to underline Obama's promise to take a bipartisan approach to politics - and John Kerry, the failed Democratic presidential candidate of 2004.</p> <p>Obama's two leading foreign policy advisers are Tony Lake, who was Bill Clinton's national security adviser, and Susan Rice, who also worked for the national security council under Clinton, and who favours US involvement in Darfur.</p> <p>An ideological battle is taking place inside the Obama camp over whether or not to pursue liberal intervention abroad or take a more pragmatic and limited approach to foreign affairs. An indication of the priorities is Obama's proposal to appoint three national security council deputies who would have more power than in the past and cover Iraq, Afghanistan and terrorism.</p> <p>The names mentioned most often as White House chief of staff have been Tom Daschle, a former Senate leader, congressman Rahm Emmanuel, and Podesta. The present defence secretary, Robert Gates, could stay in his post. For the treasury job, names include Timothy Geithner, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Larry Summers and Robert Rubin, both former secretaries to the treasury under Clinton.</p> <p>If McCain were to win, Lehman or Rick Davis, McCain's campaign manager, would be in the running to become White House chief of staff, the New York Times suggested on Saturday. For the secretary of state job, names mentioned included senator Joe Lieberman, a former Democrat who is now an independent, and Robert Zoellick, president of the World Bank. For the treasury post, the New York Times suggested it might be John Thain, chief executive of Merrill Lynch, or Zoellick.</p>",
  "<p>Hillary Clinton is long gone from the presidential race, but the women of US TV news are still leaving an indelible mark on the campaign scene this year. </p> <p>From MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, whose new programme has doubled its primetime ratings in one month, to CBS's Katie Couric, who has buried her critics with tough interviews of Sarah Palin, female presenters are increasingly prominent.</p> <p>\"People love these women,\" Marie Wilson, a women's rights advocate, says. \"The popularity of and trust in these women, who have been on everything from Meet the Press [on NBC] to Fox News, has really increased the normalcy of women experts on TV.\"</p> <p>Wilson, who founded the White House Project, which aims to advance women in leadership, points to a singular driving force behind the female ascendance in US political news: Clinton. \"It wasn't until you got a serious woman contesting for president that you got a serious decision to put women on the air.\"</p> <p>Campbell Brown, who jumped from NBC to host her own CNN show in March, became a YouTube sensation when she refused to let a young Republican spokesman dismiss questions on Palin's foreign policy experience. The segment was so pointed that John McCain cancelled a future CNN appearance in retaliation, but Brown's network stood by her.</p> <p>Some female presenters are pitted against not only McCain and Barack Obama but their male counterparts as well. When the Republican nominee accused MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski of pro-Obama bias during a live interview, her co-host Joe Scarborough promptly sided with McCain. But Brzezinski would not back down. </p> <p>\"As a characterised Obama supporter, which I take objection to,\" she told McCain, \"I'll just say, take care of my brother working on your campaign.\"</p> <p>The high visibility of these strong female presenters is a welcome development for women's rights campaigners. Yet many warn that US political news is a long way from parity between the sexes. \"There's a double-edged sword here because we've seen so much problematic coverage,\" says Jennifer Pozner, director of the advocacy group Women in Media &amp; News. \"More coverage is not always better. We need to look at the content as well as the people providing the content.\"</p> <p>Much of that problematic coverage centred on Clinton, who was caricatured by some TV presenters as an emasculating woman with a campaign made possible by her successful husband. After the former first lady ended her presidential run in June, Couric offered a postmortem to CBS news viewers. \"One of the great lessons of [Clinton's campaign] is the continued and accepted role of sexism in American life, particularly in the media,\" she said.</p> <p>The next great test of women's rise in the US media may come after the election, when NBC will crown the new host of America's most popular Sunday politics programme, Meet the Press. The current frontrunners for the job are all white males - a fact that alarmed the Washington-based communications consultant Margot Friedman into starting a campaign of her own.</p> <p>Friedman has launched the website dontletnbcdiswomen.org to marshal support for a female presenter for the role. She has not endorsed a particular newswoman for the job, but her site suggests Brown, Gwen Ifill of PBS and Andrea Mitchell of NBC. If Obama becomes the first black president next week, Friedman says, \"it's going to be a whole new ball game in the US. And yet, if you turn on the TV on Sunday morning, it looks like 1980. It's funny that mainstream media is not keeping pace with what's happening in politics.\"</p>",

  "<p>Israel looked set last night for an early general election after the prime minister designate, Tzipi Livni, failed to broker a deal with the religious right and form a new coalition government .</p> <p>Livni, who replaced Ehud Olmert as leader of the dominant centrist Kadima party last month, visited Israel's president, Shimon Peres, and urged him to call a new poll.</p> <p>\"I'm sick of this extortion. We'll see all these heroes in 90 days,\" Livni is quoted as telling her advisers after refusing to yield to the demands of the religious right.</p> <p>A new election and the prospect of a victory for the rightwing Likud party could completely derail peace talks with the Palestinians as well as wider Middle East negotiations.</p> <p>Livni called on Peres after a rollercoaster day of last-ditch attempts to salvage the negotiations. \"When it became clear that everyone and every party was exploiting the opportunity to make demands that were economically and diplomatically illegitimate, I decided to call off [talks] and go to elections,\" she said.</p> <p>Peres has up to three days to decide how to resolve the leadership crisis, which began on Israel's 60th birthday earlier this year when it was revealed that police were investigating Olmert for fraud.</p> <p>The president is expected to yield to Livni's call and schedule an election to be held in 90 days, instead of November 2010, and even then it could take several more weeks for the new prime minister elect to form a viable coalition government.</p> <p>Alternatively, Peres can appoint another parliamentary leader who he believes could form a stable government within four weeks, but this is unlikely as Livni, the leader of the party with the biggest parliamentary majority, was the most likely to succeed.</p> <p>Livni's failure to broker a deal with the religious right, in particular Shas, which was demanding massive increases to child allowances and a guarantee that the government would not give up east Jerusalem, conquered by Israel in 1967, has left the nation in a political limbo.</p> <p>As a leader tainted by corruption, Olmert's mandate to act on behalf of the nation has been greatly diminished, yet he could remain at the helm for at least three more months - and possibly five - until a new coalition government can be formed.</p> <p>As a result, Olmert told the cabinet yesterday that when the winter session of parliament opens today, he will not outline a political agenda for the future as expected. \"In the current circumstances, this would be incorrect. Therefore, I will make short remarks on socioeconomic issues and not those which certainly stand at the base of serious disagreements among the Israeli public,\" he said.</p> <p>The US-backed peace talks with the Palestinians and the back-channel talks with Syria, via Turkey, are two such divisive national issues that are expected to grind to a halt.</p> <p>But while Olmert is powerless to act on such issues - especially after the parliament passed a law earlier this year requiring a referendum or a two-thirds parliamentary majority for Israel to sign a peace deal involving territorial concessions - he faces growing political unrest and threats of violence from Jewish ultra-nationalists, Palestinian in-fighting in the West Bank and an increasingly independent, self-funding Hamas regime in Gaza.</p> <p>Jewish ultra-nationalists again clashed with Israeli soldiers and police on the weekend after the government ordered the demolition of an illegal outpost. Settlers from Kiryat Arba, a settlement near the Palestinian city of Hebron also rampaged through a Palestinian village, smashing windows and vandalising graves.</p>",
  "<p>The Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has fallen ill due to exhaustion brought on by his heavy workload, a close associate has told the Iranian state news agency.</p> <p>The announcement comes as doubts have surfaced over whether Ahmadinejad will seek re-election next year.</p> <p>MP Mohammad Ismail Kowsari, an ally of the president, said on Saturday that Ahmadinejad was feeling under the weather because of the strain of his position, according to the news agency, IRNA. \"The president will eventually get well and continue his job,\" said Kowsari, who accompanied Ahmadinejad on his visit last month to the UN general assembly. \"Every human being can face exhaustion under such a workload.\"</p> <p>He gave no further details about the state of the president's health.</p> <p>Ahmadinejad, who rarely misses meetings and public appearances, cancelled a speech on Wednesday at a conference and did not appear at a Cabinet meeting the same day. But the president, who turns 53 today, did attend a religious ceremony on Saturday in Tehran, though he looked tired as he greeted supporters.</p> <p>In recent weeks, some of his supporters have been discussing potential candidates for the June 2009 election, implying that the sitting president is not their automatic choice. </p> <p>However, Kowsari accused opponents of using Ahmadinejad's illness as an excuse to spread rumours about whether he will run for a second term. </p> <p>\"Those who use such a natural issue for psychological warfare will fail to gain support in public opinion,\" he said. </p> <p>No other details about Ahmadinejad's illness were immediately available.</p> <p>Since the 1979 Islamic revolution, every Iranian president has been re-elected for a second term, except the first incumbent, Abolhassan Banisadr, who fled the country in 1981. The months ahead are critical for Ahmadinejad if he wants to try to rebuild his political base and rebut critics who point to his unfulfilled campaign promises, including extending Iran's oil revenues to poorer provinces around the country. With more than 10% unemployment and 30% inflation, Iran was unable to reap the benefits from record-high oil prices earlier this year.</p> <p>Criticism over his management of the country has increasingly come from his erstwhile conservative backers.</p> <p>Ahmadinejad is also confronting questions about his uncompromising stance with the west over Iran's nuclear plans, which has severely soured international relations. The UN has placed sanctions against Iran three times since Ahmadinejad took office in 2005, over its refusal to halt uranium enrichment.</p>"
