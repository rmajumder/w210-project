  "<p>Pity Georgia's bedraggled first infantry brigade. And its second. And its hapless navy.</p> <p>For the past few evenings in the foothills of the Southern Caucasus on the outskirts of Joseph Stalin's hometown of Gori, reconnaissance units of Russia's 58th army have been raking through the spoils of war at what was the Georgian army's pride and joy, a shiny new military base inaugurated only last January for the first infantry, the army engineers, and an artillery brigade.</p> <p>A couple of hours to the west, in the town of Senaki, it's the same picture. A flagship military base, home to the second infantry brigade, is in Russian hands. And down on the Black Sea coast, the radars and installations for Georgia's sole naval base at Poti have been scrupulously pinpointed by the Russians and destroyed.</p> <p>Gori and Senaki are not ramshackle relics of the old Red Army of the type that litter the landscape of eastern Europe. \"These bases have only recently been upgraded to Nato standard,\" said Matthew Clements, Eurasia analyst at Jane's Information Group. \"They have been operationally targeted to seriously degrade the Georgian military.\"</p> <p>\"There is a presence of our armed forces near Gori and Senaki. We make no secret of it,\" said the general staff in Moscow. \"They are there to defuse an enormous arsenal of weapons and military hardware which have been discovered in the vicinity of Gori and Senaki without any guard whatsoever.\"</p> <p>The \"enormous arsenals\" are American-made or American-supplied. American money, know-how, planning, and equipment built these bases as part of Washington's drive to bring Nato membership to a small country that is Russia's underbelly.</p> <p>The American \"train and equip\" mission for the Georgian military is six years old. It has been destroyed in as many days. And with it, Georgia's Nato ambitions. \"There are a few countries that will say 'told you so'\" about the need to get Georgia into Nato,\" said Andrew Wilson, Russia expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \"But many more will want to walk away from the problem. And for the next few years, Georgia will be far too busy trying to pick itself up.\"</p> <p>If Georgia and Nato are the principal casualties of this week's ruthless display of brute power by Vladimir Putin, the consequences are bigger still, the fallout immense, if uncertain. The regional and the global balance of power looks to have tilted, against the west and in favour of the rising or resurgent players of the east.</p> <p>In a seminal speech in Munich last year, Putin confidently warned the west that he would not tolerate the age of American hyperpower. Seven years in office at the time and at the height of his powers, he delivered his most anti-western tirade </p> <p><strong>Pernicious</strong></p> <p>To an audience that included John McCain, the White House contender, and Robert Gates, the US defence secretary and ex-Kremlinologist, he served notice: \"What is a unipolar world? It refers to one type of situation, one centre of authority, one centre of force, one centre of decision-making. It is world in which there is one master, one sovereign. This is pernicious ... unacceptable ... impossible.\"</p> <p>This week, he turned those words into action, demonstrating the limits of US power with his rout of Georgia. His forces roamed at will along the roads of the Southern Caucasus, beyond Russia's borders for the first time since the disastrous Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s.</p> <p>As the Russian officers sat on the American stockpiles of machine guns, ammunition, and equipment in Gori, they were savouring a highly unusual scenario. Not since the Afghan war had the Russians seized vast caches of US weaponry. \"People are sick to the stomach in Washington,\" said a former Pentagon official. And the Russians are giddy with success.</p> <p>Celebrating the biggest victory in eight years of what might be termed Putinism, the dogged pursuit by whatever means to avenge a long period of Russian humiliation and to deploy his limited range of levers - oil, gas, or brute force - to make the world listen to Moscow, the Russian prime minister has redrawn the geopolitical map.</p> <p>In less than a week, Putin has invaded another country, effectively partitioned Georgia in a lightning campaign, weakened his arch-enemy, President Mikheil Saakashvili, divided the west, and presented a fait accompli. The impact - locally, regionally, and globally - is huge.</p> <p>\"The war in Georgia has put the European order in question,\" said Alexander Rahr, one of Germany's leading Russia experts and a Putin biographer. \"The times are past when you can punish Russia.\"</p> <p>That seems to be the view among leading European policymakers who have been scrambling all week to arrange and shore up a fragile ceasefire, risking charges of appeasing the Kremlin.</p> <p>\"Don't ask us who's good and who's bad here,\" said Bernard Kouchner, the French foreign minister, after shuttling between Tbilisi and Moscow to try to halt the violence. \"We shouldn't make any moral judgments on this war. Stopping the war, that's what we're interested in.\"</p> <p>His boss, President Nicolas Sarkozy, went to the Kremlin to negotiate a ceasefire and parade as a peacemaker. Critics said he acted as Moscow's messenger, noting Putin's terms then taking them to Tbilisi to persuade </p> <p>Saakashvili to capitulate. Germany also refused to take sides while Italy warned against building an \"anti-Moscow coalition\".</p> <p>That contrasted with Gordon Brown's and David Milliband's talk of Russian \"aggression\" and Condoleezza Rice's arrival in Tbilisi yesterday to rally \"the free world behind a free Georgia\".</p> <p>The effects of Putin's coup are first felt locally and around Russia's rim. \"My view is that the Russians, and I would say principally prime minister Putin, is interested in reasserting Russia's, not only Russia's great power or superpower status, but in reasserting Russia's traditional spheres of influence,\" said Gates. \"My guess is that everyone is going to be looking at Russia through a different set of lenses as we look ahead.\" </p> <p>In Kiev certainly. Ukraine's pro-western prime minister, Viktor Yushchenko, Saaksahvili's fellow colour-revolutionary, is chastened and wary. His firebrand anti-Russian prime minister, Yuliya Tymoshenko, has gone uncharacteristically quiet.</p> <p><strong>Invasion</strong></p> <p>\"An invasion of Ukraine by 'peacekeeping tanks' is just a question of time,\" wrote Aleksandr Sushko, director of Kiev's Institute of Euro-Atlantic Cooperation. \"Weimar Russia is completing its transformation into something else. If Russia wins this war, a new order will take shape in Europe which will have no place for Ukraine as a sovereign state.\"</p> <p>All around Russia's rim, the former Soviet \"captive states\" are trembling. Even Belarus, the slavishly loyal \"last dictatorship in Europe\", went strangely silent, taking days before the regime offered Moscow its support. \"Everybody's nervous,\" said Wilson.</p> <p>The EU states of the Baltic and Poland are drumming up support for Georgia, with the Polish president Lech Kaczynski declaring that Russia has revealed \"its true face\". That divides the EU since the French and the Germans refuse to take sides and are scornful of east European \"hysteria\" towards Russia. Rahr in Berlin says the German and French governments are striving to keep the Poles and the Baltic states well away from any EU-led peace negotiations. It was the Germans and the French who, in April, blunted George Bush's drive to get Georgia into Nato. They will also resist potential US moves to kick Russia out of the G8 or other international bodies.</p> <p>There are many who argue that Putin's gamble will backfire, that he has bitten off more than he can chew, that Russia remains weak, a \"Saudi Arabia with trees\" in the words of Robert Hunter, the former US ambassador to Nato.</p> <p>Compared to the other rising powers of China, India or even Brazil - the companions referred to as the BRIC - Russia does indeed appear weak. Its economy struggles to develop goods or services, depends on raw material exports and on European consumption and the price of oil for its current wealth.</p> <p><strong>Resources</strong></p> <p>But Putin's talent is for playing a weak hand well, maximising and concentrating his limited resources, and creating facts on the ground while the west dithers.</p> <p>\"There is a lack of a clear and unified European policy towards Russia,\" said Clements. In the crucial contest over energy \"the Russian strategy of keeping control of exports and supply is outpacing any European response\".</p> <p>Putin may now calculate he can call off the dogs of war, having achieved his aims and able to pocket his gains very cheaply. The Georgia campaign becomes the triumphant climax of Putinism.</p> <p>\"In politics, it is very important to know one's measure,\" wrote Aleksey Arbatov, director of Moscow's International Security Centre. \"If Russia continues to inflict strikes on Georgian territory, on facilities, on population centres, we may lose the moral supremacy we have today.\"</p> <p>But Wilson and many in eastern Europe worry that rather than being the climax of Putinism, the Russians in Georgia signal the start of something else. \"This may not be a culmination, but only step one,\" said Wilson. \"If you don't stop this kind of behaviour, it escalates.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>\u00b7</strong> North Korea's shooting double medallist Kim Jong-su became the first Olympic champion to be stripped of his prizes for failing a dope test, the International Olympic Committee said yesterday.

  "<p>Newspaper coverage of the 2008 American election has been dominated by the rise of Barack Obama, but in the political literature published this summer the recurrent figure is, perhaps surprisingly, Richard M Nixon. The only American leader to have resigned is being remembered in non-fiction - Rick Perlstein's Nixonland - and fiction: invented characters interact with Tricky Dick in Ethan Canin's recent novel America America and, now, the new thriller by Stephen L Carter.</p> <p>A phrase from Perlstein's subtitle - The Fracturing of America - explains the reason for this sudden emphasis: these writers indict Nixon for the division of American politics into mutually uncomprehending tribes of left and right, and for the use of ruthless tactics in the conduct of campaigns and elections that saw off Al Gore and John Kerry, and may yet keep a white man in the White House for another four years.</p> <p>Carter is a law professor at Yale and his novels (the previous two were The Emperor of Ocean Park and New England White) take place in the overlap between the legal and political worlds, with particular attention to the African-American elite. His special subject is the black upper class, a section of American society generally ignored, for understandable reasons, by authors charting the poverty and racism that have been the more general experience of what Carter, through all his books, calls \"the darker nation\".</p> <p>Palace Council attributes this striking phrase to Eddie Wesley, a fictional young literary star whom the book places in the group of Negro (as the word then was) authors who gathered around Langston Hughes in the 1940s and 1950s. Hughes appears in the novel, as does Nixon, the span of the narrative stretching from his election to the vice-presidency in 1952, to President Ford's pardon for his disgraced predecessor in September 1974.</p> <p>In the time of Vice-President Nixon, after a smart party in Harlem to celebrate the engagement between the children of two members of the Negro \"aristocracy\", Wesley stumbles upon the dead body of a white lawyer, Phil Castle, a big Republican party fundraiser and adviser to President Eisenhower. Wesley is admitted to these circles both through literary success and through his connection via marriage to the Garlands, the first family of the darker nation, later generations of which feature in Carter's earlier novels.</p> <p>The dead man in Harlem is holding a cross in his hand and is soon established to have been part of a cabal that may be the underground government of America. These hints of a religious conspiracy are another example of the way in which almost all crime and thriller fiction now feels obliged to flutter its eyelids hopefully at the Da Vinci Code readership. The murdered lawyer, it turns out, has written a testament, a kind of alternative American constitution, which has mysteriously disappeared.</p> <p>But whereas Dan Brown used secrets and codes to dramatise fatuous impossibilities, Carter employs conspiratorial and paranoid plotting to highlight the reality of American political division: the Vietnam war, racial conflict and the rise of underground revolutionaries such as the Weathermen are all cleverly incorporated into the struggle between two competing visions of America which, as always in Carter's fiction, can not be neatly categorised as white and black.</p> <p>In another blessed distinction from Brown, Carter's prose is slow and methodical, full of well-researched detail such as the times and places where a black American could hope to be picked up by a cab-driver in the New York of the 1950s and 1960s. He is skilled at injecting pace and tension through canny use of foreshadowing: we know within a few pages that Eddie Wesley will ultimately \"help to topple a president\", while another character is introduced with the news that \"his murder was still 30 months away\".</p> <p>Even by the lax standards of the genre of faction, Palace Council has a slippery attitude to history: as the writer cheerfully confesses in an afterword, quite important events - the trial of the physicist J Robert Oppenheimer, and even Ford's pardon of Nixon - are nudged across the calendar to suit the story. This book, then, should not be read by dead-eyed pedants, but others will enjoy a historical thriller that efficiently delivers both thrills and history, especially in the still under-developed chronicles of black America.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Mark Lawson's Enough is Enough is published by Picador.</p>",
  "<p>Haji Juma Khan leads something of a charmed existence. A towering tribesman from Afghanistan's border badlands, Khan uses the title \"Haji\" because he has completed the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, Islam's holiest shrine. But piety is not his sole concern: he is also one of about 20 men who run Afghanistan's \u00a32bn heroin trade. Business is good. Last year the country's fields of pretty pink poppies produced a record harvest, sending drug production soaring to new heights, funding the Taliban and thrusting Afghanistan into ever greater chaos. And despite the best efforts of western counter-narcotics specialists - who have spent six years and more than \u00a31.7bn in fighting the heroin trade - Khan is free as a bird. </p> <p>His empire is centred on Baramcha, a scruffy town in the Chagai Hills on the Pakistani border. Khan, an ethnic Baluch, seized control of this parched area in the dying days of Taliban rule in late 2001 and turned it into a bustling hub of smuggling and gun running. It is dotted with heroin labs: rough shacks where turbaned men, tutored by imported chemists from Iran and elsewhere, use chemicals and vats of boiling water to refine bars of sticky brown opium into bags of powdery white or brown heroin. The drug departs on convoys of high-speed jeeps, bristling with weaponry, that dash across the desert towards the Iranian border. It is then sold to criminal gangs who push the heroin to its end customers: addicts in Europe and Russia. </p> <p>The town is also a springboard for Taliban attacks. Insurgents pass through training camps and madrasas in the town on their way north into Helmand, where 8,000 British troops are based. Opium flows in the opposite direction. The vast, unruly province provides Khan with a bountiful supply of raw drugs. Last year Helmand produced 53% of the Afghan poppy crop, making it the world's single greatest source of illicit drugs, producing more than Colombia, Mexico and Burma combined. Impressive for a province with just 2.5 million people. </p> <p>Khan makes the law in Baramcha and brooks no dissent. The last time the provincial government dispatched a team of border police to the town, three years ago, 11 officers were captured and reportedly beheaded. More recently, Khan's operations have been raided by Commando Force 333, an Afghan paramilitary unit trained by the (British) Special Boat Service. Afghan soldiers swoop in armoured helicopters, forcing their way into the drug labs and arresting whomever they find. Their British mentors usually come, too. The latest raid on Baramcha, in June, netted five tonnes of opium; 13 smugglers, including four Iranians, were arrested. </p> <p>Commando Force 333, operating under great secrecy from a fort south of Kabul, is considered a success in the war on drugs. But it has never come close to Khan. He is more likely to be found in the port cities of the United Arab Emirates - Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah - where, money-laundering experts say, much of Afghanistan's dirty cash ultimately ends up. Khan has snapped up property and a small fleet of cargo ships, based in Sharjah, which according to reports he has used for smuggling heroin out of Pakistan. His wealth is conservatively estimated in the tens of millions of pounds - money that may also be funding bloodshed: counter-narcotics officials have evidence of a meeting between Khan and insurgents including senior Taliban figures and lieutenants of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, an al-Qaida sympathiser fighting US forces in Afghanistan's mountainous east. </p> <p>The Taliban appears to have lost its aversion to drugs since 2001, when the black-turbaned fighters banned the poppy crop at gunpoint. Now they tax farmers who grow poppies at a rate of 10% and, in some places, protect drug-smuggling convoys, also for a slice of the profits. This lucrative sideline earns the fighters at least \u00a350m a year, according to the UN; others put the figure higher. Men such as Khan are key to their success. </p> <p>The world's leading counter-narcotics agencies - America's Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Britain's Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) - are trying to keep tabs on him from their Kabul embassies. Yet they cannot lay a glove on him. Instead Khan flits with ease between the UAE, Baramcha, Quetta in western Pakistan, and Kabul. \"He's everywhere, just doing his thing,\" one official admits. </p> <p>Ironically, the authorities once had him in their grasp. In late 2001 US soldiers picked up an elderly, pious-looking Baluch tribesman near the southern city of Kandahar. They identified him as Khan, Time magazine later reported, but their objective was Osama bin Laden and the Taliban leader Mullah Omar. Border rogues were low on their list of priorities. And so the soldiers let him go. </p> <p>It was a costly error. In the years since, it has become clear that the fight to save Afghanistan - from the Taliban and from debilitating corruption - is unlikely to be won without getting the better of men such as Khan. </p> <p>The project of rebuilding Afghanistan, so heartily promised by President Bush after his troops invaded in 2001, is in grave peril. The country is in terrible shape. A resurgent Taliban has swept the southern and eastern provinces, destabilising the countryside and knocking at the gates of Kabul. Britain has so far lost 114 soldiers; the past two months were the deadliest ever for American troops there. The other, less visible, threat is equally ominous. Drug-related corruption has infected every level of government, crippling governance programmes and dangerously undermining Afghan leaders in the eyes of their own people. Policemen, parliamentarians, governors and probably several ministers are on the drug networks' payroll. President Hamid Karzai has been forced repeatedly to deny allegations that members of his own family are involved. Among western allies, patience is fraying. Thomas Schweich, a former senior US official, launched a scathing attack on Karzai last month, accusing him of sheltering the drug lords. \"He was playing us like a fiddle,\" he wrote in the New York Times. </p> <p>The war on drugs is about much more than money. In other countries drugs are a criminal activity driven by greed. In Afghanistan, battered by three decades of conflict, they are a tool of political power. \"Afghanistan isn't like anything anyone has worked on before from a drug perspective,\" says Doug Wankel, a veteran counter-narcotics officer. \"This is not Burma or Thailand or Mexico or Colombia. This is a fledgling nation that is just starting to stand up again after 30 years of disarray and destruction. It's so fragile, and corruption is such an issue, that this whole drug thing can play into the other ills of the country, destroying this government and pushing the nation into big-time civil disorder. Why? Because you have so many people who can get so many weapons. It's entirely different, I'm telling you.\"</p> <p>Wankel, a 62-year-old American, has long experience of Afghanistan's drug wars. His career began in 1970 when, as a Missouri law student, he saw a TV ad for the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, predecessor of the DEA. \"I'm sitting there thinking James Bond and women and adventure. So I called the toll-free number,\" he recalls. They sent him to Detroit, then the murder capital of America, where his job was to buy drugs: cocaine and PCP (phencyclidine) in well-to-do white neighbourhoods and heroin in the run-down black areas. Wankel, skinny as a rake, passed for a junkie. The experience blew his mind. \"You remember Shaft?\" he says. \"You actually had these guys on the streets, wearing their big-brimmed hats and fancy long coats, and driving those pimpmobiles with the white walls. It was amazing, just like you see on TV.\"</p> <p>Eight years later, seeking a fresh adventure, the young DEA officer had himself transferred to Kabul. It was a pivotal moment. Three months on, the dictator Muhammad Daud was overthrown in a communist coup. At the end of the following year, in December 1979, 100,000 Soviet troops rolled in. The Red Army occupation triggered a bloody 10-year war between the Soviets and CIA-funded fighters known as the mujahideen. The jihad, as they called it, also marked the start of the heroin era. For 150 years Afghan farmers had grown small amounts of poppy, mostly in Badakhshan province in the north. After jihad erupted, the business got serious. Shinwari tribesmen in eastern Nangarhar and their tribal cousins, the Afridis in Pakistan's Khyber Agency, started to process opium into heroin (10kg of opium makes about 1kg of heroin). Profits multiplied, and by the mid 1980s Afghanistan was supplying one third of the world's heroin. </p> <p>By then Wankel had left - the Soviets had accused him of spying - and moved on to operations in Pakistan, Colombia and Peru, rising to the number three position in the DEA. In 2004 he was called back to Afghanistan to coordinate counter-narcotics policy, and now works as a private consultant. He is frustrated at how the west has mishandled the drugs war. \"From the beginning the military thought they could do security and leave narcotics and corruption for later. They were wrong,\" he says. \"There's got to be a comprehensive strategy that also involves rule of law, corruption and drugs. Otherwise you can forget it.\"</p> <p>The more the west has poured money into fighting drugs in Afghanistan, the more heroin has poured out of the country. Since 2002 the UK, which coordinates the international effort, has spent \u00a3262m on training soldiers, police, investigators and judges, and building a new drugs court. The US has given \u00a31bn. In addition the two countries have blown a total of \u00a3420m on \"alternative livelihoods\" - rural development projects to persuade poppy farmers to switch crops. Over the same period the poppy crop has exploded, hitting a record high of 193,000 hectares last year - enough to carpet Greater London and the Isle of Wight. (This year's crop figures are due later this month.) Nor is all of this produce exported: driven by much misery and an abundance of cheap heroin, Afghanistan's own addict population is rising fast. The last survey, three years ago, recorded 920,000 users; the number is almost certainly higher now, a flood of drug-using refugees having since returned from Pakistan and Iran. </p> <p>These failures have caused bewilderment and a bad-tempered debate about how to combat drug production in Afghanistan. None of those involved - Karzai, western diplomats, Nato generals, many self-styled counter-narcotics experts - seems able to agree on the answer. The Senlis Council, a pugnacious NGO, favours legalising the poppy crop. Others, chiefly in America, press for wholesale destruction. Last year the US spent \u00a388m on an eradication programme run by DynCorp, a company that employs many retired American special forces soldiers. Over the harvesting season, DynCorp led hundreds of Afghan workers through the fields of Helmand and Uruzgan, thrashing down poppies with tractors and sticks. Fired at by angry farmers and opportunistic insurgents, and obstructed by bent local officials, the eradicators managed to destroy just 3,000 hectares. This seemed a bad deal. It would have been 10 times cheaper - and less bloody, since three eradicators were shot - to have simply bought the farmers' opium. But that solution doesn't work, either, as the British discovered five years ago when a buy-back scheme collapsed after officials realised it simply encouraged farmers to grow more poppies the next year. They turned up at the Kabul embassy demanding payment from embarrassed British officials. In diplomatic circles, the episode has been politely forgotten.</p> <p>The other big idea is aerial spraying. The US favours dispatching armoured crop-duster planes loaded with the weedkiller Roundup to spray the poppy fields; British and Afghan officials are opposed to the idea, saying it would enrage already hostile farmers. The US ambassador William Wood, who was formerly posted to Colombia, has tried to convince Afghan officials worried about the safety implications of the herbicide, saying he would even take a shower in it. A British official retorted: \"It's Roundup. My dad puts it on his weeds. It doesn't mean he uses it for his tea or to bathe in.\" </p> <p>But the focus on farmers, who are often poor and indebted, seems unfair. According to the UN, the average southern poppy farmer made \u00a31,658 from last year's harvest. That's about one third more than he would have earned growing wheat, enough to clothe his children and send them to the local school - assuming the Taliban hadn't torched it. By contrast, the 20 top traffickers pulled in profits of \u00a31.5bn. It's time to switch focus, says Christina Oguz, head of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in Kabul. \"We are looking too much at cultivation and not enough at the top of the drug networks,\" she says.</p> <p>A 96-cell high security jail for high-level drug traffickers has been built, with \u00a31.1m of British money; it was handed over to the Afghan justice ministry last June. As no drug lords have been captured, however, it is likely to be filled with Taliban commanders. The heads of the drug networks, meanwhile, live freely, openly flaunting their great wealth. A raid by DEA agents on the home of a major trafficker in Nangarhar last November gives a sense of the sums involved: meticulously kept account books detailed heroin shipments worth \u00a381m over a nine-month period. In a broken, poverty-stricken country such as Afghanistan, these gangsters' main difficulty is spending the money. Status demands a few essentials. A fleet of Lexus Land Cruisers - hulking 4x4s with tinted windows, video entertainment systems and usually no licence plate - is de rigueur, as are gangly mansions in Sherpur, a new Kabul neighbourhood known for \"narcotecture\" - a gaudy style with sweeping balustrades, wedding-cake plasterwork and blue mirrored windows. The label may be unfair - some Sherpur residents surely earn their money honestly - but in a country in which drugs account for one third of gross domestic product, and the competing exports are carpets, fruit and nuts, many Afghans have a different idea. \"The owners are the ones who killed our people and drank our blood,\" construction worker Hussain told me three years ago outside a mansion he was building. \"But at least it is providing us with work.\"</p> <p>Most of the drug loot goes abroad. \"There are a lot of wealthy people in Afghanistan but the money is not here,\" says Nick Lockwood, a former drugs adviser at the British embassy. \"It's in Dubai.\" Traffickers wire their profits to the UAE using hawala, the age-old informal money transfer system that is cheap, fast and, best of all, leaves no paper trail. When it lands there are few questions asked: along with the Russian mob and Colombian cartels, Afghan drug lords are among Dubai's big investors.</p> <p>One \"big fish\", as Afghans call them, has been netted - in rare circumstances. In 2005, American agents lured Haji Bashir Noorzai, leader of a major smuggling clan in Kandahar, to New York. Noorzai thought he was there to curry favour with the Americans by providing intelligence on the Taliban. He was put up in a smart Manhattan hotel not far from the site of the destroyed Twin Towers, and interrogated, in a friendly way, for more than a week. But on the 13th day, the agents clapped him in handcuffs and brought him before a judge. The DEA later described him as the \"Pablo Escobar of Afghanistan\"; Noorzai's lawyer says he was a victim of entrapment. His trial is due to start shortly. </p> <p>That ruse is unlikely to work a second time. So the latest western scheme is to improve - in fact, build from scratch - Afghanistan's own justice system. It is a gargantuan task. The necessary institutions are rotten: the police are poorly trained and corrupt; so are the judges. Most honest, educated officials have fled the country. In the rare instances when Afghan courts have sent major drug traffickers to jail, they have almost invariably been released within weeks - on the orders of senior government officials. Oguz of the UNODC calls this \"telephone justice\".</p> <p>Undaunted, Britain and America are training the police. A dedicated counter-narcotics force has been set up; Soca and DEA agents are currently teaching a new \"special investigations unit\" the arts of phone-tapping, running informers and gathering evidence. Recruits to this force must pass lie detector and urine analysis tests, and not all make it: drug addiction levels among police are said to be extremely high.</p> <p>In an effort to evade Afghanistan's flawed courts, these donors have set up a special drugs court on the edge of Kabul. Western lawyers train its prosecutors. Judges are paid 10 times more than the going rate in the hope of keeping them honest. This appears to be working: last year the court scored 278 convictions, up from 182 in 2006. Sentences are stiff, with a minimum jail term of 10 years. Yet this system is not perfect: prosecutors are markedly better funded and prepared than defence briefs. \"It's very questionable,\" Oguz says. \"Getting evidence is not just about putting the big guys in, it's about making sure innocent people are not in prison.\" And none of those big guys has appeared before this court. </p> <p>The big problem, in almost every counter-narcotics scheme, is corruption. Allegations of covert drug trafficking swirl around many of the leading Afghan officials in the key ministries. Some may be explained as malicious gossip; others are based on hard evidence. One afternoon I visited General Kamal Sadat, who until last year headed the counter-narcotics police. Now, after failing a Soca lie detector test, he is unemployed. British officials asked if he had ever taken a bribe and, he told me angrily, \"I told them the truth.\" But instead of blaming the British, Sadat attributed his downfall to the machinations of his rival - and former colleague - General Muhammad Daud, the deputy interior minister for counter-narcotics. \"It was just a way for him to get me out,\" he spat. </p> <p>Daud is certainly a controversial figure. A former militia leader under the warlord Ahmed Shah Masood, he is a personable man with a taste for dapper suits. Investigations by the Los Angeles Times and other papers have linked the minister and his family to narcotics. Last year one of his senior aides was sentenced to 12 years for trying to sell drugs confiscated by the police. Daud, who harbours ambitions for higher political office, brushes the charges off with a laugh. But two years ago the British took them so seriously, they tried to have him fired; he survived thanks to support from Karzai and the US embassy. Now the British have learned to live with him: in June, Daud visited London on a police training course. </p> <p>Counter-narcotics officials acknowledge that they must work with people who are modestly - or \"acceptably\" - corrupt. After 30 years of war, few Afghan politicians have a clean slate, Wankel says. \"None of us would be able to survive under the circumstances these people have been through in the past 30 years. They obviously did what they had to do. Americans want to think black and white. But you gotta throw that out the window when you come to Afghanistan. Everything here is a shade of grey.\" </p> <p>There's less moral wiggle room for President Karzai. With an election looming next year, he stands accused of going slow on the drugs war to avoid annoying powerful supporters. How things change: in 2004 I attended a conference in the heavily-guarded presidential palace where Karzai declared a \"jihad\" on drugs. Foreign counter-narcotics officials now deride this as a bad joke. The president has not even made symbolic sacrifices: many point to the fact that his anti-corruption tsar, Izzatullah Wasifi, is a convicted drug dealer who served nearly four years in a US jail after being caught selling heroin in a Las Vegas hotel. \"I was a youngster,\" Wasifi told me with a shrug. More troubling allegations centre on Karzai's younger half-brother, Ahmed Wali Karzai, head of the Kandahar provincial council and reputed to be involved in the drugs trade. \"This is really a lot of rubbish,\" Karzai told Der Spiegel in June. \"I have thoroughly investigated all these accusations, and of course none of them are true.\" But the rumours persist.</p> <p>Karzai's relations with the British are strained. In early 2006, under pressure from Britain, Karzai dismissed Sher Muhammad Akhunzada, the long-standing governor of Helmand province and an alleged drug smuggler. The evidence was persuasive: in a raid on the governor's office a few months earlier, DEA officials had found nine tonnes of opium in the basement. (Akhunzada claimed he'd seized the consignment from a smuggler and was about to turn it over to the police.) The head of the DEA, Karen Tandy, later testified to America's Congress that this was the largest stash her agents had seized in Afghanistan. But Karzai, who has family ties with Akhunzada stretching back to the mujahideen war, did not punish him. Instead he rewarded the ex-governor with a seat in the upper house of Afghanistan's parliament. </p> <p>In April I went to see Senator Akhunzada at his Kabul house. For an alleged druglord, it was disappointingly sparse. Sure, a black Land Cruiser was parked in the driveway, but the carpets were mangy and soiled, the ceiling was blotched with damp and the television was an old-fashioned cathode ray tube model - not even a plasma screen. Gently stroking his beard and puffing on a Marlboro Light, Akhunzada lamented the worsening insurgency in his home province. \"Every day more killing and injuries,\" he said, shaking his head. \"Another attack on a police station today. Seven dead.\" In his view, he alone could end the violence. \"If only the British would listen, I could help,\" he sighed, \"but we do not have good relations. If I was governor, the Taliban would not have captured even five inches of land. Now they have five districts.\" He may be right that he could bring change - British officials believe his powerful militia is still running drugs. </p> <p>In a farewell act of chutzpah, Akhunzada handed me a sheaf of paper with his own prescriptions for the drug crisis. It was titled \"Preventation [sic] of poppy cultivation\". The fourth point read: \"The government should make one exact list of smugglers.\" </p> <p>For one such smuggler, Haji Juma Khan, these are interesting times. The Baluch from Baramcha is trying to go legit. According to several officials, Khan has made the government an offer: in return for an amnesty, he will quit the drugs business and invest his money in Afghanistan. \"Think of The Godfather Part III,\" says one source, referring to the movie in which Al Pacino's Michael Corleone tries to go straight. In the film it all goes wrong for Corleone. He ends up a lonely and broken man, slouched on the balcony of a Sicilian villa. The final act of Khan's career, however, has yet to be written.</p>",
  "<p>The first man stopped short in the clearing just south of Soledad. \"Sure is a lonely place,\" he said. \"That bastard bus driver coulda dropped us at the ranch.\"</p> <p>\"What ranch?\" said his huge companion.</p> <p>\"So you forgot awready, Lennie,\" the small man replied. \"You son-of-a-bitch.

  "<p>Days after Russia scored a stunning geopolitical victory in the Caucasus, President Abdullah G\u00fcl of Turkey said he saw a new multipolar world emerging from the wreckage of war.</p> <p>The conflict in Georgia, G\u00fcl asserted, showed that the United States could no longer shape global politics on its own, and should begin sharing power with other countries.</p> <p>\"I don't think you can control all the world from one centre,\" G\u00fcl told the Guardian. \"There are big nations. There are huge populations. There is unbelievable economic development in some parts of the world. So what we have to do is, instead of unilateral actions, act all together, make common decisions and have consultations with the world. A new world order, if I can say it, should emerge.\"</p> <p>G\u00fcl, relaxing in a hotel suite with a spectacular view of the glistening Bosphorus, spoke just hours before meeting with the visiting president of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. </p> <p>He rejected the idea, promoted by the United States and Israel, that the best way to deal with Iran was to isolate, sanction and punish it. \"There are so many important issues, like the nuclear issue, Iraq, the Caucasus, Afghanistan,\" he said. \"Iran is definitely having some influence of these issues, so we are talking.\"</p> <p>G\u00fcl said Iran had a right to develop nuclear energy but not nuclear weapons. \"We don't want to see weapons of mass destruction in this region,\" he said. \"If it's in our neighbourhood, we definitely don't want to see it.\"</p> <p>Asked about the possibility of an American attack on Iran, G\u00fcl replied: \"I don't want to think about that. Everybody should take a lesson from what happened in Iraq,\" he said. \"Diplomatic solutions are always better than hard solutions.\"</p> <p>Few countries in the world have changed as dramatically as Turkey over the last decade, and G\u00fcl is among the most intriguing new political leaders to emerge here during that period.</p> <p>When first elected, he seemed to be part of a new Islamic wave that was challenging the entrenched secular elite. He is a practicing Muslim who married his wife when she was 15; she wears the headscarf that some secular Turks consider a badge of reactionary Islam. Yet he and his closest political ally, the prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, have led a political revolution that has brought Turkey closer to democracy than any regime in the modern state's 85-year history.</p> <p>G\u00fcl said Turkey could play a decisive role in bridging the chasm that separates the west from more turbulent regions. His country's effort to join the European Union, he said, was its \"main agenda\".</p> <p>\"I wish to see Turkey as an island where the European standard of democracy is being fulfilled and the free market economy is functioning very well,\" he said. \"This will be a real gift to the region, to the world, for peace. And this Turkey will be a source of inspiration for so many.</p> <p>\"As we are transforming ourselves in that direction, we will not forget our natural links and relationships and advantages with other countries - Muslim countries, central Asian countries, Caucasus countries, Middle Eastern and other countries,\" he added, speaking in fluent English. </p> <p>\"Turkey is having a positive impact on them, spreading the values of democracy, freedom, rule of law. Also, the economic changes here ... are admired. Maybe that is the indirect influence of this country.\"</p> <p>For much of this year, political life in Turkey was frozen as the constitutional court considered a prosecutor's charge that the ruling Justice and Development party should be banned because it was a \"focus of anti-secular activity\". Last month the court rejected that argument. </p> <p>Now, G\u00fcl said, Turkey's priority must be to resume its stalled progress towards political reform. \"In the last two years, we spent our energy on domestic issues, and the reforms slowed down,\" he said. \"Now, after the court case, there is a new era. This is a big opportunity for Turkey. Everybody realises that reforms are necessary.\"</p> <p>Some European leaders, G\u00fcl said, fail ed to recognise the contribution that Turkey was making to stability in the world's most volatile region.</p> <p>\"This is a big asset for Europe,\" he said. \"Turkey has great capacity to influence the region, indirectly, very peacefully, being an inspiration for changes. Turkey has been playing this role already. This has not been appreciated enough.\"</p> <p>Opposition to Turkish membership in the EU was for years based on the country's failure to meet democratic standards. More recently, politicians in some European countries have sought votes by bashing Turkey and pledging to keep it out of the EU regardless of its progress toward democracy. These campaigns, G\u00fcl said, harmed Europe's long-term interests.</p> <p>\"Europe should realise that Turkey can do more for the stability and security of the region,\" he said. \"Start with the Caucasus; last month, the problem was not serious, but suddenly we found ourselves in a war situation. </p> <p>\"Europe should encourage Turkey, and not create some artificial problems during the negotiation process with us. Some member countries or some politicians should not mix domestic issues and strategic issues. Domestic issues are conjunctural; today it's there and tomorrow it's not. But the strategic issues are always there, and we cannot sacrifice strategic issues for domestic issues. Unfortunately, nowadays we see this kind of shortsighted policies in some countries.\"</p> <p>G\u00fcl repeatedly returned to the importance of Turkey's democratisation process. He said it would ultimately resolve all of the country's domestic problems, including the long-festering conflict with Kurdish nationalists in south-eastern provinces. \"Some call it terror, some call it the south-east problem, some call it the Kurdish problem - whatever you call it, we will find a solution,\" he said.</p> <p>\"There are other problems - secularism and anti-secularism - those things will also find solutions in this climate. That is why I focus on the reform process. The problem was this: the lack of democracy, the standard of democracy. That was creating problems, not only in the south-east but in other issues. That is when we upgrade the standards, these problems will find solutions.\"</p> <p>With that, G\u00fcl was off to meet Ahmadinejad. \"Our values are different,\" he said with a smile, \"but having a good relationship helps the stability of the region.\"</p>",
  "<p>For many American commentators, plucky little Georgia has been the victim of Russian imperialism. The Guardian's Seumas Milne takes an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/14/russia.georgia\"> equally simplistic view</a>: Russia is blameless for a war caused by US \"expansion\". Both schools of thought agree that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russia</a> has been the conflict's big winner. In the long run, I am not so sure. Russia has much more to lose from a period of frosty relations with the west than either the Americans or the Europeans.</p> <p>Russia's Achilles heel is its economy. This has been growing fast, at over 7% a year. Wealth has spread out from the energy companies and the government, helping to create a prosperous middle class. But the economy remains dangerously dependent on energy and raw materials. Russia has very few high-tech industries, its record on innovation is appalling, it has too few small and medium-sized companies and its service industries are backward.</p> <p>President Dmitry Medvedev and his advisers, who have close links with many business leaders, understand that Russia needs to diversify, and that autarkic policies will make that harder. More foreign investment in Russia would help to produce the kind of broad-based economy that China enjoys. The leading Russian companies want to emulate western multinationals by taking over foreign firms, raising money on international capital markets and hiring the best talent. But if Russia makes life difficult for foreign investors, its own companies will find doors closing against them.</p> <p>Even Russia's oil and gas companies, whose output is beginning to decline, cannot thrive without foreign technology, expertise and capital. Although profitable, they lack the financial muscle that would enable them to invest in major exploration projects or overseas acquisitions without the help of foreign bank loans. </p> <p>On a recent visit to Moscow I was struck by widening divisions within the Russian elite. Business leaders have become much more critical of Vladimir Putin - occasionally in public - than they were six months ago. That is hardly surprising, given the impact of Putin's policies and comments on business confidence and the stockmarket. His personal attack on the leadership of Mechel, a leading steelmaker, hit share prices badly, as did the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/georgia\">assault on Georgia</a>. The market had already been unsettled by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/05/bp.oilandgascompanies\">fight</a> between BP and AAR for control of TNK-BP. The fact that several state agencies have intervened on AAR's side may - Russian businessmen are well aware - deter some potential foreign investors.</p> <p>Many Russian business leaders worry that Putinism - and especially its anti-western foreign policy - will in the long run damage the economy. Some senior figures in the security establishment seem oblivious to the economic consequences of their actions. Putin's and Medvedev's advisers have started to spar in public. Putin, of course, is still in charge for now, but Medvedev's clan and its allies in the business world are not without influence.</p> <p>China's leadership is pursuing a long-term strategy of not alienating the US while the Chinese economy grows big and strong. Russia's leaders are making a mistake in choosing a different strategy. Although US power is in relative decline, it will remain the world's most powerful country for many years. The war in Georgia has transformed the way Americans view Russia. Until now George Bush's genuinely warm relationship with Putin has prevented a tougher US policy from emerging. But whoever wins the presidential election, US policy on Russia will harden. For many years Russia's leaders have assumed that the US intends to encircle, weaken and dismember their country. That paranoia, largely built on fantasy, will now become more real.</p> <p>The US will step up efforts to thwart Russia in its near abroad, prevent sensitive technologies from reaching the country and curb the international aspirations of Russian companies. Although John McCain's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/11/johnmccain.barackobama\">scheme</a> to exclude Russia from the G8 is impractical, the G7 - which still exists for economic policy, and excludes Russia - will take on a larger and a more political role. </p> <p>Since the US trades very little with Russia, it can afford to take act tough. The Europeans, some of whom depend on Russian energy, cannot. The EU will remain divided between those who want to confront Russia and those who prefer a soft touch. But events in Georgia have shifted the centre of gravity of the European debate in a more critical direction. German public opinion, with its pacifist tendencies, has been shocked to see Russian tanks and warplanes in action. A few days before the fighting broke out, I met a German banker who works a lot in Russia and sits on the boards of several Russian companies. He normally defends Putin from all criticism. But on this occasion he told me that Russia's leaders had become so arrogant and greedy that he feared they would make serious mistakes. If Putinism continues on its current course, Russia risks alienating Germany, its best friend in Europe.</p> <p>The EU cannot do much to 'punish' Russia. If it blocked Russia from WTO membership, or stopped the talks on a new partnership and co-operation agreement, it would damage the moderates within the Russian system. But the EU could - and in the long run probably will - do two things. The first, as my colleague Tomas Valasek argues in <a href=\"http://www.cer.org.uk/pdf/briefing_georgia_15aug08_tv.pdf \">a recent CER policy brief</a>, is to strengthen ties with countries in the common neighbourhood. The EU should offer more trade and aid, encourage them to take part in many of its policies, and hold out the long-term prospect of membership, when they are ready. The second is to make clear to Moscow that the EU has a red line: if Russia tried to take over sovereign and independent states in the common neighbourhood, it would pay a price. The EU cannot and would not stop trading with Russia. But it could cut off political contacts, make it harder for some kinds of Russian to get visas, and discourage Russian businesses from entering the EU.</p> <p>Plenty of senior Russians are concerned at the prospect of a new Cold War, partly because of growing worries about China. Superficially, Russia's and China's leaders get on well, often teaming up against the west at the UN. But the Chinese, focused on the US, do not take Russia and its economy very seriously. The Russians are aware of relative strengths of their economies (in 2030, according to the <a href=\"http://http://www.cer.org.uk/pdf/p_837.pdf\">Economist Intelligence Unit</a>, China will make up 22.7% of world GDP, against Russia's 2.7%. They also fear Chinese encroachment into Russia's under-populated Asian territories.</p> <p>Throughout its history, Russia has had a poor record of making friends with its neighbours. In the multipolar world that is emerging, the country will be too weak - diplomatically and economically - to flourish on its own. It will need allies. Medvedev's people understand that splendid isolation offers no future for Russia.</p>",
  "<p>With the July terrorist attack on the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7492601.stm\">Indian embassy in Kabul</a> \u2013 which left 41 dead and the finger of suspicion pointing at the Pakistani intelligence services \u2013 the world was again reminded why the Indian subcontinent has eclipsed the Middle East as the world's flash-point. </p> <p>Both American presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, have made clear that they expect the Pakistani government to take action against militants, and that they would be willing to authorise strikes inside Pakistan. But a more comprehensive Euro-Atlantic approach will be required to deal with the region's problems. </p> <p>The story of western failure in Afghanistan is now all too familiar, painfully illustrated, almost weekly, by the repatriation of <a href=\"http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=82b44aed-713c-4b5f-b408-a29b1b215b03\">fallen Nato soldiers</a>. But the story is repeated across the border in Pakistan, with serious consequences for both countries. </p> <p>The optimism that followed the recent <a href=\"http://www.elections.com.pk/\">Pakistani elections</a> has turned to concern as the government's negotiations with militants appear to have made a terrorist safe-haven safer and attacks against Nato forces in Afghanistan <a href=\"http://www.ecfr.eu/content/entry/commentary_drafting_a_new_afghan_pakistan_strategy/\">more frequent</a>. Pakistan's military and intelligence services are sympathetic to an Islamic fundamentalist creed, militant groups affiliated with al-Qaida operate freely on its territory, and government infighting has made it difficult to establish civilian control over the military. </p> <p>In any case, the ability of the Pakistani military to deal with the current threat, let alone a widespread insurgency, is questionable, as is western leverage on Pakistan's security forces. As a result, loss of control of parts of Pakistan to an increasingly capable alliance of militant groups is a serious near-term threat. </p> <p>If American policy has failed to deal with this growing problem, European policy has focused on technical assistance, with the European Union providing <a href=\"http://www.theparliament.com/policy-focus/foreign-affairs/foreign-affairs-article/newsarticle/eu-presses-musharraf-for-pledge-on-free-and-fair-elections/\">\u20ac125m in aid</a> between 2002 and 2006. Moreover, Europe is Pakistan's <a href=\"http://www.mfa.gov.pk/Spokesperson/2008/Jan/Spokes_16_01_08.htm\">largest trading partner</a>, accounting for 27.4% of total exports and 17% of imports. In 2005 alone, EU imports from Pakistan totaled \u20ac3.4bn. </p> <p>Yet, despite this, it is hard to escape the conclusion that the EU's role in Pakistan bears all the hallmarks of the pre-Maastricht polity that it no longer wants to be: technocratic, apolitical, and marginalised by the United States. </p> <p>This needs to change. The US, even under a new president, cannot succeed in the region without a united front with Europe. And Europe cannot hope to achieve its aims with technical programs alone. </p> <p>To create a framework for US-European cooperation, work needs to begin now. Several reports that will influence the McCain and Obama campaigns are already being written in Washington. But none of these will be able to chart a way forward for transatlantic cooperation. Moreover, they risk repeating the standard pattern of US-European cooperation: the US as the policy developer and Europe as the apolitical and hesitant money-spender. </p> <p>Genuine transatlantic cooperation will require that solutions be developed jointly, and that European leaders \"own\" the policy options. Otherwise, European governments will find it difficult to explain the need to step up efforts in the region, and the European Commission's technical programmes will continue to define the EU's policy. </p> <p>To build the necessary unity and a political strategy, a European Baker-Hamilton-style commission is necessary. Such a commission, with senior European members, could examine the key issues in the region, visit all countries and players and develop a set of recommendations for a new transatlantic approach to begin in early January 2009 when a new US president is in place. </p> <p>And who better to launch this than Nicolas Sarkozy? The French president has already played a crucial role in bridging the US/European divide on the <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1725866,00.html\">Afghan mission</a> and \u2013 after a successful donor's conference \u2013 has taken the help of the EU's rotating, six-month presidency. </p> <p>Ideally, such a commission should be independent, but endorsed by the French, German and British governments and EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana, as well as, however tacitly, Senators McCain and Obama. </p> <p>Everyone knows of the dangers posed by instability on the Afghan-Pakistan border, in Pakistan and the region. In July, Pakistani and Indian soldiers waged a 12-hour gun battle across their disputed border. But so far, little has been done to develop the kind of Euro-Atlantic consensus about policy options necessary for a new US president and Europe to collaborate. </p> <p>Worse still, the rejection by Ireland of the Lisbon treaty threatens to push the issue further back in the queue. But European leaders must not take their eyes off real-world problems and drafting a new Euro-Atlantic policy on Afghanistan and Pakistan is as real as it gets.</p> <p><em>Copyright: <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a>/European Council on Foreign Relations, 2008</em></p>",
  "<p>Leftist ex-bishop Fernando Lugo became Paraguay's president today, ending six decades of one-party rule in a key step in the poor South American nation's democratic transformation.</p> <p>Tens of thousands of Paraguayans cheered as Lugo raised his hand in the air and was sworn in, wearing sandals and his trademark white mandarin-collared shirt to set himself apart from the suit-wearing politicians.</p> <p>Speaking in both Spanish and the Guarani indigenous language, Lugo pledged to end the misery and corruption that has defined Paraguay under the Colorado Party, which supported the brutal 1954-1989 dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner and has ruled ever since.</p> <p>\"Today Paraguay breaks with its reputation for corruption, breaks with the few feudal lords of the past,\" said Lugo, who neatly trimmed his beard for the ceremony.</p> <p>His first challenge will be to balance competing and potentially explosive interests.

Lugo, she said, is the first Paraguayan politician who has ever cared about her needs.</p> <p>\"He's totally different from all the others,\" she said. \"He's humble and he listens to the people.\"</p> <p>While Lugo is under pressure to make changes fast, experts don't expect him to govern with sudden decrees like the continent's hardcore leftists, Bolivia's Evo Morales and Venezuela's Hugo Chavez. They predict he will seek broad support for reforms, in the style of Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Brazil's center-left president.</p> <p>Those three leaders were among eight Latin American presidents who attended Friday's ceremony and welcomed him into the ranks of the region's growing left-leaning governments.</p> <p>Chavez promised to help Lugo bring \"a profound transformation\" to Paraguay.</p> <p>\"Our friend Fernando will have a revolutionary government, and he'll have difficult times ahead, but we'll support him,\" Chavez said. \"He won't be alone in his task of changing this country in a revolutionary way.\"</p> <p>Morales, also pledged support: \"Bolivia is putting itself at the side of this new administration to work together for the dignity of people neglected for decades due to the hegemony of the powerful groups,\" he said.</p> <p>Lugo, 57, spent 11 years as a bishop ministering to poor peasants in Paraguay's farmbelt before entering the political scene three years ago. The presidency is his first elected post.</p> <p>Despite receiving belated and unprecedented permission from Pope Benedict to resign as bishop, the new president promised Friday that \"this layman will remain faithful to his church.\"</p>",

  "<p>John MacDougall was clearly well-respected as an MP and the obituaries that have been published following his death on Wednesday have all paid tribute to his decency and his commitment to his constituents.</p> <p>But there was poignant observation in <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/john-macdougall-labour-mp-for-glenrothes-894374.html\">the Independent's obit</a> which took me by surprise, because it contradicted one of the standard assumptions made about MPs.</p> <p>According to the article, written by the former Labour MP Tam Dalyell (who has been writing excellent obituaries of Labour figures for the Independent for years), MacDougall wished he had never become an MP.</p> <p>Dalyell wrote:</p> <p>\"Heavyweights of local councils, especially those who have led successful and well-regarded administrations, can come to the House of Commons and feel very disappointed. In 2001, having been a huge fish in a relatively small pool, John MacDougall found himself a small fish, and perhaps a fish out of water, in the pool of Labour backbenchers of the House of Commons. On our plane journeys back to Scotland on a Thursday night, when we often sat next to each other, he would tell me that he thought it was a great mistake ever to have come to London.\"</p> <p>If so, why did MacDougall, who had had a distinguished career as a council leader, want to go to Westminster in the first place? Dalyell suggests it was to do with party loyalty.</p> <p>\"The circumstances of his election were that with the establishment of the Holyrood parliament in Edinburgh, the MP for Fife Central, Henry McLeish, had become the deputy first minister (and was soon to be the first minister on Donald Dewar's death in 2000). It was perceived by the Labour party that there was a good deal of ill-feeling in Fife and that they had better have a popular person as a local candidate and take nothing for granted. As a man of many friends, MacDougall was elected, very much with the blessing of his parliamentary neighbour Gordon Brown.\"</p> <p>It's easy to assume Parliament houses 646 men and women who are all obsessed with ambition and determined to cling to their seats at all costs. It's healthy to be reminded that, just occasionally, that's not true.</p>",
  "<p>Russia said today that South Ossetia and Abkhazia were unlikely to want to remain part of the Georgia as the war of words between Washington and Moscow grew more heated.</p> <p>The Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, said he respected the principle of territorial integrity but \"after what happened, it's unlikely Ossetians and Abkhazians will ever be able to live together with Georgia in one state\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336626325\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2007/12/11/mp.jpg\" alt=\" Dmitry Medvedev\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dmitry Medvedev.

He said Georgia's integrity and sovereignty must be respected and that a contentious relationship with the US was not in Moscow's best interests. \"Bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century,\" Bush said.</p> <p>The US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, today arrived in Tbilisi to bolster Georgia after it was routed by Russia.</p> <p>Medvedev, speaking in the Black Sea resort of Sochi where he had talks with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said: \"If someone continues to attack our citizens , our peacekeepers, we will of course respond in just the same way we have responded. There should be no doubt about this.\"</p> <p>Moscow appeared to raise the temperature further by saying Poland's agreement to host a US missile defence system exposed it to attack. Colonel General Anatoly Nogovitsyn, deputy head of the Russian general staff, was quoted by the news agency Interfax as saying: \"Poland, by deploying (the system), is exposing itself to a strike \u2013 100%.\"</p> <p>Earlier, he had reiterated Russia's warning that placing missile defence structures in Poland and the Czech Republic would bring an unspecified military response.</p> <p>Poland agreed last night to station interceptor rockets at missile silos as part of a US missile defence shield in the Baltic region.</p> <p>The US says the shield is aimed at Iran, but Russia's Nato ambassador, Dmitry Rogozin, told Reuters news agency that \"the fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between Russia and the United States over the situation in Georgia shows that of course the missile defence system will be deployed not against Iran but the strategic potential of Russia\".</p> <p>Merkel said some of Russia's actions against Georgia over South Ossetia had been \"disproportionate\" and Russian troops should withdraw from central areas in Georgia. Washington has warned that the fighting could set back Moscow's relations with the west for years, but has ruled out engaging militarily in the region.</p> <p>Rice's visit came after the US sent military transport planes with humanitarian and medical supplies to Georgia, coupled with a warning from Bush to Russia not to obstruct the aid effort.</p> <p>Despite a draft French-brokered ceasefire requiring Russian and Georgian forces to return to pre-conflict positions, Moscow's forces today remained deep in Georgian territory well outside the disputed regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.</p> <p>Georgia has not formally signed the ceasefire agreement, which allows Russian peacekeepers to remain in South Ossetia. Russian troops were today still blocking the entrance to Gori, which sits on Georgia's main east-west road, although they allowed in some humanitarian supplies.</p> <p>Georgia's president, Mikheil Saakashvili, warned that \"Russia's invasion of Georgia strikes at the heart of western values\". In an article for the Washington Post, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/aug/15/georgia.russia\">reprinted in today's Guardian</a>, he said: \"If the international community allows Russia to crush our democratic independent state, it will be giving carte blanche to authoritarian governments everywhere.\"</p> <p>Russia has dismissed western insistence that Georgia's territorial integrity forms the basis of any settlement of the conflict. The Kremlin's stance has fuelled fears that it is determined to annex South Ossetia and Abkhazia.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch said today it had collected evidence of Russian warplanes using cluster bombs against civilians in Georgia. Military aircraft killed at least 11 civilians and injured dozens of others in Gori and the village of Ruisi on Tuesday, the group said. This was denied by the Russian general staff.</p>",
  "<p>Here's one difference between Barack Obama's campaign and John Kerry's. It took Kerry 15 days to respond to the swift-boat veterans, and even when it did respond it did so in a mealy-mouthed and girly-man sort of way.</p> <p>Now, two days after Corsi got front-page New York Times treatment, the Obama campaign has issued a lengthy, point-by-point refutation of dozens of Corsi inaccuracies and false allegations.

Let's see what happens,\" said the official. </p> <p>Musharraf's chief spokesman, retired Major-General Rashid Qureshi, said he had no knowledge of any plan by Musharraf to step down or negotiations on his resignation. \"I'm tired of saying there's no such thing,\" he said. </p> <p>But Tariq Azeem Khan, a politician close to Musharraf and a former deputy government minister, said talks were continuing. \"Well-wishers are trying to ensure that matters are settled amicably through discussions rather than going through a long, protracted impeachment process,\" he said. </p> <p>The party of assassinated former prime minister Benazir Bhutto is expected to being impeachment proceedings on Monday.

He will try and stay in Pakistan,\" said the official.</p> <p>The paper said the main stumbling block had been Musharraf's demand that he be allowed to retire to his farm in Islamabad, with immunity from prosecution.</p> <p>In Washington, the White House spokeswoman, Dana Perino, referred to reports of Musharraf's resignation plan as a \"rumour mill\". \"We've heard the reports and we continue to monitor it,\" she said, adding that the US considered the leadership of Pakistan an issue for Pakistanis. </p> <p>Musharraf seized power in a 1999 coup but has been isolated since his allies lost an election in February.<br> In an Independence Day address yesterday, Musharraf issued a call for reconciliation to tackle economic and security problems. But coalition officials were unswayed and have continued with their impeachment plan. </p> <p>Coalition leaders said this week that the army, which has ruled for more than half the country's history since its founding in 1947, would not intervene to back Musharraf, its former leader. </p> <p>While coalition officials were hoping Musharraf would quit, others said he should answer charges brought against him before stepping down. \"The next 48 hours are important. If he does not resign than we are ready to move the impeachment motion against him on Monday,\" said another official. </p> <p>Bhutto party official Farhatullah Babar said his party and its main coalition partner, the party of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, whom Musharraf ousted in 1999, differed on the question of prosecuting the president. </p> <p>Sharif said on Thursday that Musharraf had to face the consequences of his actions but Babar said any decision should be left to parliament.</p>",
  "<p>Should George Bush feel vindicated in his decision to invade Iraq five years ago, now that the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/aug/15/iraq.military\">situation in Iraq - particularly Basra - is improving</a>?</p> <p>No doubt as he leaves the White House, Bush will argue that a more stable Iraq justifies his decision to topple Saddam Hussein. The US president is bound to repeat the mantra that the world is better off without Saddam. <a href=\"http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article4390033.ece\">The dramatisation House of Saddam</a> is a useful reminder of what a nasty piece of work he was, not to mention his pathological elder son, Uday.</p> <p>The debate is more than academic, as Iraq represents a clear division between the two US presidential hopefuls.

Recruitment into terrorist cells shot up all over the world. North Korea and Iran accelerated their development of nuclear weapons. Iran has emerged as the dominant regional power in the Persian Gulf once the US removed its major rival from the scene and put its Shi'ite clients into power in Baghdad. While everyone is better off without Saddam Hussein around, the cost was hugely disproportionate. If you don't believe this, ask yourself whether Congress would ever have voted to authorise the war in 2002 if it knew there was no WMD, or that there would be trillion-dollar budget outlays, or that there would be 30,000 dead and wounded after five years of bitter struggle.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Fukuyama then goes on to make the point that after having invaded Iraq, the US does not have much of a leg to stand on in \"trying to rally opposition to Russia on the basis of international law and norms constraining the strong from using force against the weak\".</p> <p>Interestingly, this neo-conservative goes on to throw his vote behind Obama rather than McCain because the Democrat does not share \"McCain's instinctive reliance on hard power as the primary instrument for dealing with messy questions of terrorism and proliferation in the broader Middle East\".</p> <p>This is an edited extract from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/wrap/subscribe\">The Wrap</a>, guardian.co.uk's digest of the day's papers</p>",

  "<p>The quest for peace in the Middle East is a fragile and delicate affair. Even at the most promising moments, when it seems finally within grasp, it can so easily slip away. Not long after the news of the <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article4449488.ece\">latest round</a> of serious (but indirect) talks between Syria and Israel was made public, we learn that the Israeli government is on the verge of collapse.</p> <p>But rather than despair at the latest setback, both sides should redouble their efforts to keep the peace talks afloat. In a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/14/syria.israelandthepalestinians\">previous article</a> I discussed what Israelis should do; now it's time to look at what Syria should do. </p> <p>The blueprint of a durable and workable deal appears to have been hammered out by negotiators, but there is currently little mutual trust for it to see the light of day, leaving plenty of room for sceptics and extremists to undermine and derail it. However, with a little daring, the forthcoming Israeli elections could provide a golden opportunity for Syria to put its case for peace directly to the Israeli electorate.</p> <p>What Syria needs to do is to up the peace ante with a spectacular confidence-building gesture. This could come in the form of an offer of direct, top-level talks with Israel's next prime minister, if he or she sticks to the principle of returning the Golan Heights in exchange for peace. This could help nudge a peace deal with Syria to the top of the election campaign, win the trust of the electorate and call the bluff of those using Syria's rejections of direct talks as a sign of ill intent.</p> <p>So far, the Syrian president Bashar al-Assad has ruled out direct talks until after the Israeli elections, but there's no reason why he can't already make a clear offer now to the future leader. He <a href=\"http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=10&amp;categ_id=2&amp;article_id=93346\">told reporters</a> in New Delhi in June that direct talks were \"not like drinking tea \u2026 The meeting between me and the Israeli prime minister will be meaningless without technocrats, who are the experts, laying the foundation.\"</p> <p>Undoubtedly, the role of experts is important for laying the technical foundations for peace, but this ignores the potential goodwill that can be built with the simple act of sharing a cuppa \u2013 or, in other words, setting down the essential psychological keystone that must underpin a settlement. It is public figures and not anonymous technocrats who can lay the appropriate emotional groundwork and create the kind of mindset conducive to the difficult task ahead of squaring the political circle.</p> <p>The late Egyptian president Anwar Sadat understood the importance of this psychological threshold. Although Israeli public opinion was initially against returning the Sinai, he won enough Israeli public adoration to pave the way to peace with his <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/19/newsid_2520000/2520467.stm\">spectacular visit</a> to Israel. There are <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull&amp;cid=1211872830750\">murmurs</a> in Israel that Syria could use some of that Sadat seduction.</p> <p>Personally, I do not expect Bashar al-Assad, a reserved and private man who lacks the flamboyance and passion for risk-taking of the former Egyptian president, to address the Knesset, but some strategically targeted flesh-pressing and shared smiles with Israel's next leader could truly start a long overdue thaw in relations. It's not as if this is something entirely new to him: during the funeral of Pope John Paul II in 2005, Assad <a href=\"http://www.arabnews.com/?page=4&amp;section=0&amp;article=61832&amp;d=9&amp;m=4&amp;y=2005\">shook hands</a> with Moshe Katsav, Israel's president at the tiime.</p> <p>Of course, Sadat is widely seen in Syria as a traitor \u2013 or, at the very least, a let-down \u2013 to the Arab cause. In <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913679-2,00.html\">his quest for a settlement</a>, at a certain level, he did betray the frontline Arab states by not coordinating his position with them and by his cavalier attitude. This, along with <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,919150-6,00.html\">memories</a> of his father's icy reaction to Sadat's visit, might put Assad off taking such a high-profile step.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Sadat showed foresight and daring by bowing to the inevitable and expressing publicly what most Arab leaders admitted in private: that an accommodation with Israel was the only game in town. Even Gamal Abdel Nasser \u2013 who grew to become the embodiment of the pan-Arabist ideal and to whom Syria selflessly <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Republic\">surrendered its sovereignty</a> in an attempt to fulfil its dream of Arab unity \u2013 believed that peace with Israel was the only way forward, but he never articulated it in public because he feared the reaction of the \"Arab street\".<br> Syria is also constrained by its declared principles. \"Any direct negotiations will not take place until after there is a clear resolution of the land-in-return-for-peace issue and Israel's commitment and clear stand on the mechanisms,\" a high level Syrian source <a href=\"http://www.asharqalawsat.com/english/news.asp?section=1&amp;id=13147\">said</a>. The source also argued that this would be tantamount to recognising Israel, which Syria is not prepared to do before a peace deal has been reached.</p> <p>But Syria needs to discard this fossilised and outdated notion. Even negotiating through an intermediary is a tacit form of recognition, so why not come out of the closet about it? Syria's refusal to recognise Israel makes no practical difference to either country. In contrast, a formal recognition would be a tiny bureaucratic step, but a massive and positive psychological leap for both sides, since it would put to rest persistent rumours that the Arabs do not accept Israel's right to exist and prepare Syria for eventual political and economic ties once the conflict is fully resolved. </p> <p>I understand that the Syrians are acting on principle and feel they should not recognise Israel until it recognises an independent Palestine, but peace between Syria and Israel could serve the Palestinian cause, by building trust and giving Israel one less justification for continuing its occupation. </p> <p>At the very least, it can't make things worse, since there is very little that a weak and isolated Syria can do to serve the Palestinian cause. But as a stronger and more integrated member of the international community, it can exercise far more diplomatic clout in the efforts to assist the long-suffering Palestinians. Besides, after six decades of futile Arab help that has often done more harm than good, perhaps the Palestinians are best left to manage their own cause.</p> <p>Domestically, peace will bring Syria in from the cold and give it a broader circle of friends than only Iran, an alliance that has hurt Syria's relationship with other Arab countries, as well as with the west. In addition, it will free Syria up to pursue its economic development and, by removing the fears and excuses of the conflict with Israel, could put the country back on the path to the democracy that was shattered in the wake of the 1948 defeat.</p>",
  "<p>Sensation seekers, shift your gaze away from Kerry Katona's indispensable analysis of the battle for the White House in her OK! column (\"basically, the American presidential election is going on,\" she reveals to a startled world, but that proves merely to be the amuse bouche before she unleashes her big scoop: \"And it's a race between Democratic Barack Obama and an older guy called John McCain\").</p> <p>Banish from your mind the sage words of Britney Spears in her first interview for two years: \"I'd just as soon my children had a normal childhood,\" she says, underlining her tireless efforts in that direction by making them pose for the cover of a celebrity magazine wearing matching white tuxedos and trilby hats.</p> <p>Let us instead turn our attentions to Paris Hilton and the Lawsuit That Was Bound to Happen: the $75,000 Worldwide Entertainment Group is seeking in damages from the heiress for allegedly failing to fulfil her promotional obligations for the 2006 film National Lampoon's Pledge This! It claims that, despite her executive producer's credit, Hilton became \"disenchanted with the film after producers included scenes which involved nudity\".</p> <p>And who can blame her? You work for National Lampoon because of its reputation as the embodiment of cinema's most rarefied and intellectually rigorous strata: this is, after all, the company that made Dorm Daze 2, Jake's Booty Call, Homo Erectus and the bittersweet Rohmerian vignette of blossoming sexuality, Barely Legal. The last thing you expect it to produce is some puerile teen comedy with loads of gratuitous shots of naked bosoms.</p> <p>But while it's understandable that Hilton balked at being associated, however tangentially with nudity - rigorous probity being very much her trademark - Lost in Showbiz can only boggle at what Worldwide Entertainment Group was thinking in the first place.</p> <p>Even in a week when Warner Brothers appears to be rueing its decision to distribute Guy Ritchie's RockNRolla (\"it's funny in spots,\" offered Warner Brothers president Alan Horn, his uncontainable excitement finding voice in a stream of rapturous superlatives, \"it's very English . . . I'm in a shocking state of equanimity\"), it's still hard to think of anyone in the history of cinema who has made a more obvious, glaring error.</p> <p>Come on, Worldwide Entertainment Group - you know the rules as well as the rest of us. You cast the notoriously reclusive Paris Hilton solely for her acting, for the critical kudos you know her name will bring to your film, for the standing ovation at the Venice Biennale, the breathless essay in Cahiers du Cinema that delicately unpicks the nuances of her performance, the inevitable profile in Sight And Sound that fawns despite its subject's unbending refusal to court the press. You hire Paris Hilton because you want your film fast-tracked into the pantheon, the list of cinematic greats bearing her name: The Hillz, Bottoms Up, Playboy: Hef's Halloween Spooktacular, Celebrity Sex Tapes Unwound.</p> <p>Look at that list again, and ask yourself this: what kind of idiot expects the woman who starred in those films to caper around like some half-witted performing monkey, engaging in one vulgar little publicity stunt after another as if to cover up their apparent lack of any discernible talent whatsoever?</p> <p>There aren't many extant paparazzi shots of her, but Lost in Showbiz suggests you peruse the most recent, in which she's shown protecting her privacy with trademark zealousness by visiting the Playboy mansion wearing only a see-through babydoll negligee and a shocking pink thong. One word goes through the mind: dignity.</p> <p>Does the woman in that photograph look like someone prepared to compromise that dignity and their standing as an artist in order to sully her hands with the tawdry business of self-promotion? She does not.</p>",
  "<p>What a profound relief to be able to put paid to one of the most troubling questions hanging over the candidacy of Barack Obama -- namely, whether or not he is the devil-spawned Antichrist, come to earth to usher in the endtimes in which unbelievers will roast in the fiery flames of Hell. The rumour <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1830590,00.html\">gained traction earlier this month</a> when the McCain campaign released an ad entitled <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mopkn0lPzM8\">The One</a>, which used language similar to that in the bestselling <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_Behind\">Left Behind series</a> of evangelical Christian novels, set in the aftermath of the Rapture. Inconceivably, the normally measured and balanced right-wing talk-radio host Glenn Beck (not really!) even <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyifSg5RtXw\">raised the question</a> on the air. But now the authors of Left Behind, Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins, have weighed in with <a href=\"http://www.christiannewswire.com/news/371367426.html\">an authoritative statement</a>, concluding that, while it would be reasonable to suspect Obama of being a bit Antichristy, it would, in fact, be wrong:</p> <blockquote> I can see by the language he uses why people think he could be the Antichrist,\" adds LaHaye, \"but from my reading of scripture, he doesn't meet the criteria. There is no indication in the Bible that the Antichrist will be an American. </blockquote> <br> <p>For further useful clarifications like this, why not sign up <a href=\"http://secure.agoramedia.com/leftbehind/index_leftbehind22.asp\">here</a> for the Left Behind Prophecy Club? You'll receive a weekly email explaining how various events in the headlines are indicative of the impending Rapture. Still, LaHaye and Jenkins's statement raises more questions than it answers. If not Obama, who is the Antichrist? The criteria, apparently, include a) going around acting like you're the saviour of the world, b) being <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antichrist\">\"self-exalting\"</a>, and now c) not being American.</p> <p>I've been racking my brains. So far I can only think of Bono.</p>",
