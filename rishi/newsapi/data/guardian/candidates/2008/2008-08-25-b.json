  "<p>No man is a hero to his editor, but <strong>Dirk Bogarde</strong> is certainly venerated by <strong>John Coldstream</strong>, the former literary editor of the Daily Telegraph, who commissioned book reviews from the actor and has spent the past nine years first writing his biography and now editing a 500-page volume of his letters, Ever, Dirk: The Bogarde Letters. </p> <p>\"He was a fantastic friend and a really good man. Our professional relationship became a personal one,\" said Coldstream, who has edited 2m words from the surviving letters down to 250,000. Fortunately, the actor, who died in 1999, typed his letters, though usually in single spacing, with sentences devoid of punctuation meandering over several pages as he gossiped about friends, foes and fellow actors. \"His letters were streams of consciousness really, appallingly spelled and syntactically shambolic. He used the typewriter like a telephone and friends kept them because they were so damned good. He never wrote a boring letter.\" </p> <p>Some of the most striking and evocative images from 100 years of Guardian photography are being shown in A Long Exposure, an exhibition at Salford's Lowry gallery this autumn, a century after the paper appointed <strong>Walter Doughty</strong> as its first staff photographer.

  "<p>Polls in the US show that most Americans are concerned at the negativity of Europeans towards their country. Polls of Europeans suggest a straightforward solution: elect Barack Obama as US president. The most powerful leader in the world will then be more multilateralist, less aggressive and more acceptable to the European ear. But is it that simple?</p> <p>The most popular recent American president - according to surveys of Britons, Germans and Italians - is Bill Clinton. In that finding is the warning for America. During the Clinton years very little was done to combat the spread of militant Islam. Al-Qaida's planning for the 9/11 attacks didn't start when the supreme court conspired to install the nasty George Bush in the White House. It began when the ever so reasonable Clinton was still in office.</p> <p>Europeans may want someone like themselves in the White House, but difficult times call for a president willing to eschew short-term popularity and pursue long-term respect. Europeans hope for a president who will abandon Bush's foreign policy, but he has pursued many different foreign policies. What Europeans want to end is the \"neoconservatism\" seen in Iraq. But all the favoured policies of Berlin and Paris have been used by the US over the past eight years.</p> <p>\"Realpolitik\" has been tried in Pakistan, where billions of dollars have been used to prop up a west-leaning dictator. The \"multilateralism\" favoured by the EU and the UN has dominated efforts to stop Iran acquiring nuclear weapons. Crude appeasement has characterised relations with Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>Given the reduction in violence brought about by the troop surge in Iraq, it is no longer ridiculous to believe the aggressive interventionism seen in that country will turn out to be the most successful policy of the Bush era. In 10 years, Iraq may be one of the Middle East's most stable nations. In worst-case scenarios, Iran may have nuclear weapons, Pakistan may be in the hands of extremists and Saudi Arabia may be in the grip of Wahhabi fundamentalists.</p> <p>The highest moment for recent US foreign policy was after the initial invasion of Iraq. With its allies, it had used hard power, not soft. It hadn't waited on UN approval, but it had kept its promise to topple Saddam Hussein. Polls in Britain showed majority support for the war. That American strength and success caused Syria to withdraw its forces from Lebanon. Libya gave up its WMD. Pakistan's giveaway of its nuclear secrets was exposed. The grave problems we have seen since have been caused by US weakness and incompetence.</p> <p>Favouring European approaches to global problems may bring some short-term popularity, but it is more important that the world's only serious policeman is strong and seen to be strong. The world will applaud an America that quits Iraq, that submits to the authority of the UN and signs up to the economic restrictions associated with environmentalism. But insofar as those changes of policy enfeeble America, the world will become a much more dangerous place.</p> <p>America should not ignore world opinion, which has been correct to worry about the way the US has compromised on human rights in the war on terror. John McCain and Barack Obama have both pledged to end the torture-like practices that have done terrible harm to America's reputation. The next US president also needs to do much more to explain American policy and to treat US allies more generously.</p> <p>But world opinion should not stop America from taking tough decisions. An America that seeks to be loved may end up being neither loved nor respected. An America that is strong in the defence of the values of Kennedy and Reagan may be surprised at the grudging respect it will eventually earn.</p> <p>Tim Montgomerie is editor of a new website, <a href=\"http://www.americaintheworld.com\">AmericaInTheWorld.com</a></p>",
  "<p>One Democrat dominated the first day of what has been designed as a four-day celebration of Barack Obama's historic run for the White House, his compelling biography and achievements: Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>More than two months after ending her run for the nomination, Clinton, it seems, is not entirely defeated. Or at least the idea of a Clinton presidency isn't. Her first appearance here, in a breakfast with the New York delegation, was not unlike a victory lap, with posters reading: \"Hillary made history\".</p> <p>She spoke about unity, telling the crowd: \"We were not all on the same side, as Democrats, but we are now.\" But there was no mistaking the lingering rancour and divisions between the Clinton and the Obama camps yesterday, or the potential opening to the Republican nominee, John McCain, to do serious damage to the Democrats' chances.</p> <p>As Clinton did the rounds, a handful of her supporters - including the brother of a Colorado senator who is to speak at the convention - announced that they would support McCain. Two pro-Clinton groups planned street protests.</p> <p>The McCain campaign released its second television advert in 24 hours, meant to stoke a sense of grievance among Clinton's supporters at her loss of the nomination to Obama.</p> <p>Clinton disowned the advert, and any attempt to upstage Obama. \"There is no doubt in anyone's mind that this is Barack Obama's convention,\" she said. But she still could not resist imagining a different outcome. \"It would have been the same way if I had won and Barack was here, supporting the unity of the party.\"</p> <p>The mixed signals guarantee that Democratic eyes will be fixed on Clinton when she delivers her prime-time address to the convention tonight.</p> <p><strong>Unifying force</strong></p> <p>It is the start of a two-day process that will honour Clinton's close race against Obama and demonstrate her power as the woman who can help to unify Democrats around his candidacy. Tomorrow her name will be in the ballot when the convention holds its traditional roll call vote.</p> <p>The double dose of respect for Clinton was carefully choreographed by the Obama camp in an attempt to mollify her supporters and unite the party around the Democratic candidate.</p> <p>A USA Today opinion poll yesterday indicated the challenge Obama and Clinton face. Fewer than half of Clinton's supporters - 47% - are fully behind Obama. Some 23% say they might change their minds before the election, and 30% say they will vote for McCain or stay home.</p> <p>Established Democrats, elected officials and delegates who supported Clinton, expect tonight's speech to go some distance towards easing the hostilities.</p> <p>\"I think it will be a unifying moment,\" said Carolyn Maloney, a Democratic congresswoman from New York who campaigned for Clinton in New Hampshire. \"I think it recognises the importance of her race, of 18 million people voting for her.\"</p> <p>Others say the task of uniting the party goes beyond Clinton, and that Obama has to do more. \"He is going to have to reinforce his capacity for leadership,\" said Faye Wattleton, founder of the Centre for the Advancement of Women.</p> <p>Clinton's own constituency is also divided. Her supporters range from Maloney, who is now firmly on side with Obama, to lukewarm party activists, to the minority of diehard militants who will fight on even after she tells them to stop tonight.</p> <p>\"We will be looking for cues in what she says,\" said Darragh Murphy, founder of People United Means Action, one of the most militant Clinton groups. \"The last few times she expressed support for Obama, people picked up that she still wants delegates to fight for her.\"</p> <p>Those supporters among the delegates will get their chance to show their support to Clinton in the roll call vote.</p> <p>Daniel Kagan, a Colorado delegate who started a petition to force the roll call vote, saw it as a way of preserving Clinton's influence inside a party now dominated by Obama loyalists. \"This is a damage limitation exercise,\" he said.</p> <p>But the roll call has been orchestrated to rule out any prospect of embarrassing Obama with a close vote. Clinton has released her delegates, freeing them to vote for Obama. Negotiations are under way to cut off voting half way through the roll call of states. \"I'm disappointed,\" Kagan said. \"My sense is that we will lose hundreds of delegates.\"</p> <p>Even so, the elaborate efforts to win over Clinton's supporters are a source of huge frustration to the Obama camp. His faction sees the Clintons almost like old-style vaudeville performers, trying desperately to hang on to the spotlight before being pushed off the stage.</p> <p><strong>Reaching out</strong></p> <p>Clinton supporters, meanwhile, argue that the Obama camp has failed to reach out to them. \"He hasn't done much to attract my vote,\" said Awilda Marquez, a Colorado delegate who served in Bill Clinton's administration. \"He has consistently said he does not need me.\"</p> <p>Others describe active hostility, such as Obama campaign conference calls in which Clinton supporters are described as crazed kamikaze pilots.</p> <p>In reality though, Obama has been winning over Clinton supporters, although it is a painfully slow process. Despite McCain's expressions of false sympathy for Clinton, the Republican lags behind Obama by 20 points in his support from women.</p> <p>\"I think after the election many of her supporters were in mourning,\" Maloney said. She said the Obama camp had intensified its efforts to reach out to women and to adopt the populist themes that marked Clinton's campaign. \"You will see many women in the Barack administration.\"</p> <p>But it's not clear even then how strongly Clinton's 18 million will rally around. \"I'm ready to vote for him,\" said Kagan. \"I'm not going to raise funds, I'm not going to phone bank for him, but I will vote.\"<br></p>",
  "<p>Madonna's latest political statement - a montage of images shown during her tour that lumps global warming, Hitler, Robert Mugabe and John McCain into one category and John Lennon, Gandhi and Barack Obama into another - is a perfect example of the sometimes unhelpful nature of celebrity support. In recent weeks, Obama's campaign team has tried to distance its candidate from the unruly enthusiasm of his celebrity endorsers, who include Oprah Winfrey, Gwyneth Paltrow, George Clooney, Kanye West, Spike Lee, Susan Sarandon and Jennifer Aniston, to name but a fraction.</p> <p>But have any celebrities jumped on John McCain's bandwagon? Admittedly, the list isn't long, but it's no less glittering for that. Actually, it is less glittering.</p> <p><strong>Sylvester Stallone</strong> <br>In a TV interview last January the Rocky star said: \"I like McCain a lot. A lot. And you know, things may change along the way, but there's something about matching the character with the script. And right now, the script that's being written and reality [sic] is pretty brutal and pretty hard-edged like a rough action film, and you need somebody who's been in that to deal with it.\" There's an endorsement there somewhere. </p> <p><strong>Jon Voight</strong> <br>Last month, Voight wrote a cranky editorial in the Washington Times in which he said: \"If, God forbid, we live to see Mr Obama president, we will live through a socialist era that America has not seen before, and our country will be weakened in every way.\" His daughter Angelina Jolie has shown more restraint by declaring herself to be totally undecided.</p> <p><strong>Heidi Montag</strong> <br>\"Celebrity\" may be too strong a term to describe the unnecessarily prolonged notoriety of this former star of MTV's reality series The Hill, but Montag did recently announce her intention to vote for McCain, and although she wasn't actually registered to vote at the time, she may well be by now.</p> <p><strong>Stephen Baldwin</strong> <br>The born-again Christian actor may rank last among \"Baldwin brothers whose advice you would heed\" - and that's saying something - but that didn't stop him appearing on Fox News recently to deride idiotic celebrities who get involved in politics ... and then declaring his own support for McCain.</p> <p><strong>Tom Selleck</strong> <br>The Magnum PI star and member of the board of directors of the National Rifle Association has donated the maximum $2,300 to McCain's campaign.</p> <p><strong>The Beach Boys</strong> <br>They're expected to appear at the Republican convention, although the depth of their support, or, indeed, who or what comprises \"the Beach Boys\" these days, is unclear.</p>",
  "<p>Groups of protesters converging on the Democratic convention were aiming to turn up the volume yesterday after a low-key start to their disruption of Barack Obama's coronation as the party's presidential nominee.</p> <p>Organisers had predicted upwards of 25,000 protesters this week, but their first march drew only about 1,000. When morning broke on the \"freedom cage\", as a fenced-in protest zone area built for them by Democrats has been called, police outnumbered dissenters.</p> <p>\"We're here to tell people, don't put all your hopes in Obama,\" said Adam Jung, 28, an organiser with the Tent State University protest group, as he rolled up his sleeping bag. \"He's not an anti-war candidate,\" Jung added. \"He's billing himself as that. It's not true.\"</p> <p>David Svabick, 55, one of Jung's neighbours in the protest pen, was a less committed critic of the Democratic nominee. Obama is \"not why I'm here\", he said. \"There's one [candidate] about change, and the other one's not.\"</p> <p>Indeed, the tense pre-convention battles between protest organisers and police appeared to be cooling as separate bands of protesters made for manageable crowds around the city. Despite a police force 5,000-strong at the ready, Denver officials reported only five arrests so far.</p> <p>At the city courthouse a group called Recreate 68, which aims to recapture the spirit of the violent protests at the 1968 Democratic convention, gathered. They were joined by some anarchists, some Ralph Nader backers, immigrant-rights activists and some protesters looking only to keep Obama on the liberal path.</p> <p>The conflicting messages created a cacophonous effect, but Eric Verlo, 47, saw unity in the chaos. Verlo, who travelled to Denver to vent his frustration with what he called Obama's abandonment of progressive ideas, said: \"The common message people have is that parties aren't responsive to us\" .</p>",
  "<p>As the Democratic convention got under way, at least three tornadoes touched down in or near Denver, accompanied by thunder and spectacular lightning - proof, surely, that God hates liberals, although maybe he was simply expressing aesthetic objections to some of the extraordinarily tacky Obama merchandise for sale on every street corner. A tiny number of John McCain-branded goods were also available, in the interests of balance. At its main stage in downtown Denver, the news network MSNBC was distributing the most ill-conceived merchandise of the convention so far: nonpartisan t-shirts featuring both Obama and McCain. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> All eyes will be on Obama's running-mate Joe Biden when he addresses the convention tomorrow night. Or at least they will for the first hour or three: the Delaware senator has a famous tendency to ramble. The Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen once gently criticised this loquaciousness in a column, prompting a phone message from Biden, who thanked him for making the point, which he acknowledged was a fair one, although then again, he said, he did have his reasons for speaking at such length, but yes, it was probably a legitimate criticism, and that - at which point Cohen's answering machine cut him off.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> A big truck is making its way through the streets of Denver, all day, every day, urging people to \"Vote Libertarian!\". They won't, of course: almost everyone here's a Democrat, implacably opposed to the Libertarian argument that pretty much all taxation is supremely evil unless, possibly, it's being used to fund a strong military. Under a zero-taxation libertarian administration, of course, there'd presumably be no streets for such a truck to drive down. But we can cross that bridge when we come to it. Which we won't, owing to the lack of streets.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Yesterday night at the convention was all about Barack Obama's family - his wife, his half-sister and his brother-in-law were all scheduled to appear - but someone was missing: George Hussein Onyango Obama, one of his half-brothers, who lives in Kenya. Republicans in Texas released an ad yesterday that railed against the nominee for allowing his relative to live in squalor: \"If Barack cares so much about your family,\" it asks, \"why doesn't he take care of his family first?\" Awkwardly, though, George Obama isn't staying on message. \"Here [in Kenya],\" he told a reporter recently, \"I am surrounded by friends and family and feel safe and secure.\"</p>",
  "<p>Zimbabwe's main opposition party struck a blow against President Robert Mugabe yesterday when its candidate was elected as the parliamentary speaker.</p> <p>Lovemore Moyo of Morgan Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) won the ballot by 110 votes to 98, marking the first time that the opposition has held the powerful speaker position since independence in 1980. </p> <p>The ruling Zanu-PF party did not put up a candidate, choosing instead to back Paul Themba Nyathi of the breakaway MDC faction headed by Arthur Mutambara. </p> <p>The significance of the result is revealed in the numbers. Zanu-PF holds 99 seats in parliament, while the MDC splinter group has 10. During the now-stalled power-sharing talks it had been assumed that Mugabe and Mutambara had reached an agreement to work together. That would have eclipsed the MDC, which has 100 seats, leaving Tsvangirai's party on the outside over his refusal to accept a prime ministerial post answerable to Mugabe and with limited powers.</p> <p>Moyo's tally shows that numerous MDC-Mutambara MPs and perhaps even a few Zanu-PF members were willing to support Tsvangirai's party.</p> <p>Opposition MPs broke into song when the result was announced, mocking Zanu-PF as a spent force. They also occupied the government benches after being sworn in, arguing that the MDC's victory in March's parliamentary elections gave them the right. </p> <p>Emmerson Mnangagwa, the rural housing minister who is seen as a possible successor to Mugabe, appeared conciliatory in defeat.</p> <p>\"Mr Speaker, sir. This is a truly historic event and I would like, on behalf of the president, our party and this side of this august House, to congratulate you,\" he told parliament.</p> <p>The speaker's post is seen as key because Moyo will now take charge of contentious debates in the hung parliament if no power-sharing deal is reached.</p> <p>Mugabe is due to officially open parliament today despite a warning from Tsvangirai that this could end hopes of reviving the power-sharing talks that the South African president, Thabo Mbeki, is trying to broker. </p> <p>Tsvangirai won the first round of the presidential election but boycotted the run-off with Mugabe owing to a widespread campaign of state-sponsored violence and intimidation against his supporters. </p> <p>Police have instead focused on alleged MDC crimes, accusing seven MPs of committing rape, murder and electoral violence.</p> <p>Before the speaker vote yesterday, security officers arrested two opposition MPs, Elia Jembere and Shuwa Mudiwa, as they tried to enter parliament. Jembere missed the vote.</p>",
  "<h2>Ayatollah backs second term for Ahmadinejad</h2> <p>President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has received a major boost to his political authority after Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, told a cabinet meeting that he should prepare for a second term in office in advance of June's presidential election. \"Do not think this year is your final year,\" Khamenei was quoted as saying by the state news agency IRNA. His support is key to the re-election chances of Ahmadinejad, whose economic policies have been widely criticised. Khamenei controls loyalist groups, such as the revolutionary guard, which can spearhead voter mobilisation efforts. <br><strong>Robert Tait </strong></p> <h2>25 killed in government raid on Darfur camp</h2> <p>At least 25 people are feared dead after Sudanese security forces raided one of Darfur's largest camps for displaced people. Witnesses said government forces massed outside Kalma camp near Nyala in south Darfur before dawn yesterday, reportedly to search for illegal weapons and wanted persons. Several hours of gunfire ensued. The aid agency M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res said it had 65 wounded people, mainly women and children, in its clinic. One of Darfur's main rebel movements accused the government of trying to force the camp's 90,000 residents to return home. <br><strong>Xan Rice in Nairobi</strong></p> <h2>US troops out by end of 2011 in draft agreement</h2> <p>US and Iraqi negotiators have agreed on a text covering a full US troop withdrawal, officials from both countries said yesterday. The draft has to be put to both governments and the Iraqi parliament for approval. \"There is an agreement actually reached ... between the two parties on a fixed date, which is the end of 2011, to end any foreign presence on Iraqi soil,\" prime minister Nouri al-Maliki said yesterday. However, he did not make it clear whether the date was merely an \"aspirational\" target, the epithet used by the US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, who visited last week. <br><strong>Jonathan Steele in Baghdad</strong></p>",
  "<p>There is a big gap between what Bill Clinton will say to the Democratic convention tomorrow night about Barack Obama and what he thinks in private, according to a source close to him.</p> <p>While Clinton will endorse Obama, he feels little warmth towards him and relations with Obama's campaign team are brittle. \"He does not feel that Obama has given him the respect due to him as a former president,\" a former member of Hillary Clinton's now-defunct campaign team said.</p> <p>The source added that Obama should have made an effort to schmooze him after Hillary formally conceded defeat on June 7. \"He should have called Clinton and asked him for advice about foreign policy or suggested a joint appearance,\" he said. Instead, the two spoke only once in the weeks immediately afterwards. </p> <p>During the six-month nomination battle, Clinton proved less disciplined than his wife, giving vent in public to anger with the Obama campaign. </p> <p>Clinton in Denver will not want to deliver anything other than supportive words for fear of being accused of undermining the election campaign.</p> <p>The US website Politico reported at the weekend that Clinton was annoyed with the topic he has been given for the speech: foreign policy. Politico reported sources close to him as saying he would prefer to speak about the economy. This would have given him an opportunity to redress comments by Obama during the nomination battle which Clinton interpreted as a slight on his economic record.</p> <p>The former president could be an asset to Obama, particularly in winning over white, working-class males.</p> <p>One of the reasons attributed for the failure of the 2000 Democratic candidate Al Gore was his reluctance to take up Clinton's offer of help.</p>",
  "<p>The Democratic convention to endorse Barack Obama as the party's first black presidential candidate opened yesterday with a string of speakers, including his wife Michelle, lining up to offer glimpses into his personal life.</p> <p>The aim of the first day was to flesh out his background and to make more human a candidate suffering from accusations from his rival, John McCain, that he is celebrity driven, elitist and out of touch with working-class America.</p> <p>In an interview with CNN ahead of her speech, Michelle Obama said she would present their family as typically American. \"My father was a shift worker, a worker for the city all his life.\" It was not a privileged upbringing: \"No silver spoons, no magic. Just parents who tried their best to leave the next generation just a little bit better off. I think our stories are the quintessential American stories.\"</p> <p>Although Obama has been a regular presence on US screens this year, his life story and politics are still relatively unknown to most Americans. He has failed to connect with white working-class males in key states such as Ohio. A CNN poll yesterday showed him in a dead heat with McCain, at 47% each. Obama had a seven-point lead in last month's CNN poll.</p> <p>The Democratic chairman, Howard Dean, brought his gavel down to mark the start of the four-day convention, one of the most important in the party's history. He told the 4,000 delegates in the hall, and the 15,000 journalists either in the hall or tents nearby, that the convention \"will demonstrate to all Americans why we need Barack Obama and Joe Biden [his vice-presidential running mate] in the White House\".</p> <p>For most of the campaign, Obama has kept his family, other than Michelle, in the background. But his wife, two daughters and other relatives visited the convention centre yesterday morning.</p> <p>Previewing her speech, Obama told supporters on Sunday: \"You'll have a sense of who she is and what our values are and how we're raising our kids. And I think what you'll conclude is: he's sort of like us. He comes from a middle-class background. He went to school on scholarships. He had to pay off student loans. He and his wife had to worry about child care. They had to figure out how to start a college fund for their kids.\"</p> <p>As Michelle Obama gave her first major speech since her husband launched his bid for nomination 20 months ago, the Republican presidential candidate, John McCain told fundraisers in Sacramento, California, that his wife, Cindy, was to visit Georgia to assess the humanitarian situation after the conflict with Russia.</p> <p>McCain's campaign team see foreign affairs as their candidate's strong point and believe he was helped by the conflict. His wife's presence in Georgia will help bring the issue back into the US election campaign.</p>",
  "<p>It may be the Democrats' party in Denver but the Republicans are determined to crash it.</p> <p>From a small rented office-space in an unpromising neighbourhood of petrol stations and modest motels in the city, the Republican media operation has gone into full swing to try and dent the wave of press attention surrounding the Democrats convention.</p> <p>On Monday morning, the Republican party launched a new ad aimed squarely at any wavering Democrats, especially disillusioned Hillary Clinton supporters.</p> <p>Republicans also held a press conference with an assortment of former Democrats now backing Republican candidate John McCain.</p> <p>The ad features Debra Bartoshevich, a former Hillary Clinton delegate from Wisconsin. The ad shows Bartoshevich, holding a Clinton sign, declaring her support for McCain. It ends with her asking other Democrats to join her in switching sides. 'It's okay. Really,' she says to camera with a mischievous smile.</p> <p>The ad plays into one of the key tactics that the Republican attack machine plans this week: exploit any perception of a rift between Clinton and Obama.</p> <p>Certainly Bartoshevich is blunt about why she has now come out swinging for McCain and she is not shy about slamming Obama. 'I was a huge supporter of Hillary Clinton. I campaigned for her, I travelled for her. I donated time and money. I have been a lifelong Democrat. I truly believe that Barack Obama is not ready to lead the country,' she said.</p> <p>But Bartoshevich's anger was nothing compared to another former Clinton supporter, Cynthia Ruccia. The former Ohio Democratic activist has also now joined forces with the Republican campaign and her fury at the Obama campaign was palpable for her perception of how it treated women voters. 'They were ready to throw women completely under the bus. I could not believe the treatment that Hillary Clinton got,' Ruccia said 'Barack Obama has a complete blind spot where women are concerned.' In fact Ruccia became so angry that she ended up jokingly telling the gathered reporters: 'It is not a bash on men. I love men. It is about the treatment of Hillary Clinton.'</p> <p>But it was not just women ex-Democrats that were trotted out by Carly Fiorina, a former head of Hewlett-Packard, who was once one of America's top businesswomen and is an outside chance for McCain's vice-presidential choice.</p> <p>Brought onto stage was also a former Minnesota congressman, Tim Penny, and Silverio Salazar, a former Democratic official from a Colorado family famed for producing Democratic politicians.</p> <p>Both men slammed Obama on the current Republican attack point of his lack of experience. 'Senator Obama is not ready to be president yet. I don't think he will ever be ready,' Salazar said.</p> <p>The impact of the Republican tactics is hard to predict. Certainly, compared to the huge razzamatazz that has taken over Denver, their presence is tiny. </p> <p>But their message may be harder to dismiss than the small handful of volunteers, often wearing T-shirts with the word 'Nobama' on, might suggest. The lectern at the press conference bore the slogan 'A mile high, an inch deep', referring to accusations that the Obama campaign is style over substance. It also blazoned a website address called NotReady08.com. Such criticisms could potentially be hitting a nerve. Or at least Republicans are convinced they can do.</p> <p>Fiorina insisted that moderate Democrats would find a welcome home in McCain's camp. 'This is not short-term symbolism that you are seeing at this press conference,' she said.</p>",

He would only use the name Aurora. \"Maybe I'm just paranoid.\"</p> <p>At the city courthouse a group called Recreate 68, which aims to recapture the spirit of the violent protests at the 1968 Democratic convention, gathered.</p> <p>They were joined by some anarchists, some Ralph Nader backers, some immigrant-rights activists, and some protesters looking only to keep Obama on the liberal path. </p> <p>The conflicting messages created a cacophonous effect, but Eric Verlo, 47, saw unity in the chaos.</p> <p>\"The common message people have is that parties aren't responsive to us,\" said Verlo, who travelled to Denver to vent his frustration with what he called Obama's abandonment of progressive ideas.</p> <p>The protest zone \"is where you bring all those messages and say, 'we're not being represented'\", he added.</p> <p>Asked about the \"freedom cage\", a city police spokeswoman diplomatically replied that \"we're not really referring to it as that\". Officials prefer to call it \"a public viewing area of 50,000 square feet within eight feet of the delegates\", the stated rationale for its creation.</p> <p><strong>A sampling of things seen and heard at the Denver protests:</strong></p> <p>\"Lord Obama's Concept of America the Beautiful\" \u2013 the painted inscription, above a large photo of a dead infant, on an anti-abortion truck travelling the streets</p> <p>\"How the hell can they say we're illegal?

  "<p>\u2022 As the Democratic convention got under way, at least three tornadoes touched down in or near Denver, accompanied by thunder and spectacular lightning \u2014 proof, surely, that God hates liberals, although maybe he was simply expressing aesthetic objections to some of the extraordinarily tacky Obama merchandise for sale on every street corner. A tiny number of John McCain-branded goods were also available, in the interests of balance. At its main stage in downtown Denver, the news network MSNBC was distributing the most ill-conceived merchandise of the convention so far: nonpartisan t-shirts featuring both Obama and McCain. </p> <p>\u2022 All eyes will be on Obama's running-mate Joe Biden when he addresses the convention Wednesday night. Or at least they will for the first hour or three: the Delaware senator has a famous tendency to ramble. The Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen once gently criticised this loquaciousness in a column, prompting a phone message from Biden, who thanked him for making the point, which he acknowledged was a fair one, although then again, he said, he did have his reasons for speaking at such length, but yes, it was probably a legitimate criticism, and that \u2014 at which point Cohen's answering machine cut him off.</p> <p>\u2022 A big truck is making its way through the streets of Denver, all day, every day, urging people to \"Vote Libertarian!\". They won't, of course: almost everyone here's a Democrat, implacably opposed to the Libertarian argument that pretty much all taxation is supremely evil unless, possibly, it's being used to fund a strong military. Under a zero-taxation libertarian administration, of course, there'd presumably be no streets for such a truck to drive down. But we can cross that bridge when we come to it. Which we won't, owing to the lack of streets.</p> <p>\u2022 Tonight at the convention will be all about Barack Obama's family \u2014 his wife, his half-sister and his brother-in-law were all scheduled to appear \u2014 but someone was missing: George Hussein Onyango Obama, one of his half-brothers, who lives in Kenya. Republicans in Texas released an ad today that railed against the nominee for allowing his relative to live in squalor: \"If Barack cares so much about your family,\" it asks, \"why doesn't he take care of his family first?\" Awkwardly, though, George Obama isn't staying on message. \"Here [in Kenya],\" he told a reporter recently, \"I am surrounded by friends and family and feel safe and secure.\"<br></p>",
  "<p>I've been walking around for the past couple of hours getting more and more bothered by those focus-group findings Joe Klein reported, which I blogged earlier. </p> <p>What the findings really say is that the McCain attack ads of the past month have decimated the qualities and rationale that have brought Obama this far. As a result of those ads, change and charisma and eloquence are now things to be distrusted \u2013 indeed, sure-fire signifiers of a hollow core. That, friends, is a problem.</p> <p>Okay, okay, let's not read too much into one focus group of 21 people. All the same, the findings ring true to me. Obama's change message and inspirational qualities were perfect, or at least good enough, for the primary season. But this is a different election, with different voters, and an opponent that turn over every rock it can (tough as Clinton's campaign was, there were certain places it chose not to go because doing so could have led to backlash among liberal voters). </p> <p>So Obama needs to retool for this very different election. It makes sense to me that \"change\" is less compelling to independent, general-election voters than it was to Democratic primary voters. I still think that, at bottom, people are sick of conservative rule. Saying to people that America just can't afford four more years of this should resonate, provided the Obama campaign successfully hangs Bush around McCain's neck (McCain will, as the fall progresses, try to slip out of the Bush orbit wherever he can and signal to voters that he will not be the same). </p> <p>So the negative message remains fairly straightforward. But the positive message that Obama introduces Thursday needs to be quite different from the primary-season message \u2013 in some ways its opposite. For example, what kind of rhetoric does he need to employ Thursday night? Clearly he ought to stay away from all that \"we are the ones we've been waiting for\" stuff. Any \"movement\"-type rhetoric needs to go. Yet he still needs to sound visionary. People expect that out of a convention speech. Just not too visionary. It's tricky stuff.</p> <p>There's considerable anxiety out here, in my anecdotal experience. Maybe it's partly just compared to before. In early June, many Democrats would have thought Obama was going to win 30 states and this was going to be a transformative election heralding a new progressive era and all that. No one thinks that now. There's a lot on the line here. Some people are still quite bullish about the structural factors that indicate an Obama win, some less so. But everyone is at least a little nervous.</p>",
  "<p>There is a big gap between what Bill Clinton will say to the Democratic convention on Wednesday night about Barack Obama and what he thinks in private, according to a source close to the former president.</p> <p>While Bill Clinton will endorse Obama, he feels little warmth towards him and relations with Obama's campaign team are brittle.</p> <p>\"He does not feel that Obama has given him the respect due to him as a former president,\" a former member of Hillary Clinton's now-defunct campaign team said.</p> <p>The source added that Obama should have made an effort to schmooze him after Hillary Clinton formally conceded defeat in the Democratic nomination battle on June 7. </p> <p>\"He should have called (Bill) Clinton and asked him for advice about foreign policy or suggested a joint appearance,\" he said.<br>Instead, the two spoke only once in the weeks immediately after Hillary dropped out. </p> <p>During the six-month long Democratic nomination battle, Bill Clinton proved to be less disciplined than his wife, giving vent in public to anger with the Obama campaign. </p> <p>After being on the sidelines of his wife's campaign he was in the forefront in the South Carolina primary. Responding to his bullish campaign in that state, Obama's team accused him of playing the race card.</p> <p>Clinton in Denver will not want to deliver anything other than supportive words for fear of being accused of undermining the election campaign.</p> <p>But the US website, Politico, reported at the weekend that the former president was annoyed with the topic he has been given for Wednesday night's speech. </p> <p>The theme for the evening is foreign policy whereas Politico reported sources close to him as saying he would prefer to speak about the economy, emphasising the difference between the Bush administration's policies and his own.</p> <p>This would have given him an opportunity to redress comments by Obama during the nomination battle which Clinton interpreted as a slight on his economic record.</p> <p>The former president remains a formidable political campaigner and could be an asset to the Obama bid for the White House, particularly in winning over white, working-class males. </p> <p>One of the reasons attributed for the failure of the 2000 Democratic candidate Al Gore was his reluctance to take up Clinton's offer of help.</p>",
  "<p>The four-day Democratic convention to endorse Barack Obama as the party's first black presidential candidate was scheduled to kick off in Denver today with a speech by Michelle Obama tackling claims that he is elitist and un-American.</p> <p>In her first major speech since her husband's campaign for the White House began 20 months ago, she was due to try to show the human face of a candidate that his rival, John McCain, portrays as celebrity-driven and out-of-touch with working-class America.</p> <p>In an interview with CNN ahead of her speech she said she would present their family as typically American. \"My father was a shift worker, a worker for the city all his life.\" It was not a privileged upbringing: \"No silver spoons, no magic. Just parents who tried their best to leave the next generation just a little bit better off.\"</p> <p>\"I think our stories are the quintessential American stories.\"</p> <p>Her speech was part of a three-pronged approach by her husband's campaign team for the convention: flesh out his personality, elaborate on his policies and present the Democratic party as united.</p> <p>Although Obama has been a regular presence on US screens all this year, his life-story and politics are still relatively unknown to most Americans. </p> <p>He has failed to connect with white working-class males in key states such as Ohio, partly on race grounds but also because he is viewed as a dilettante.</p> <p>After two White House election defeats at the hands of Republicans, there is nervousness among Democrats in Denver about whether Obama can overcome the negatives stacked against him. </p> <p>That concern was not helped today by a CNN poll showing him in a dead heat with McCain, at 47% for each. Obama had held a seven-point lead in last month's CNN poll.</p> <p>For most of the campaign, Obama has kept his family, other than Michelle, in the background. But his wife, two daughters and other relatives visited the convention centre this morning to provide an early photo-opportunity and to scout out the hall ahead of her speech.</p> <p>In an interview with the Denver Post published today, she said she would use her speech to share stories about \"the values that drive him, experiences that shaped him, and why I believe he will be an extraordinary president. I'll also share stories about my life and my background with the country.\"</p> <p>Previewing his wife's speech, Obama told supporters yesterday, at the end of a day campaigning in Wisconsin: \"You'll have a sense of who she is and what our values are and how we're raising our kids. And I think what you'll conclude is: He's sort of like us. He comes from a middle-class background. He went to school on scholarships. He had to pay off student loans. He and his wife had to worry about child care. They had to figure out how to start a college fund for their kids.\"</p>",
  "<p>Liberal icon Senator Ted Kennedy will make an appearance at the Democratic convention in Denver tonight, rallying the party faithful behind Barack Obama and, if he feels up to it, addressing the gathering.</p> <p>The venerated Massachusetts Democrat, who is suffering from brain cancer, will be feted with a video tribute, and his niece Caroline Kennedy will make a speech praising him.</p> <p>Kennedy, who was afflicted with brain cancer this spring, travelled to Denver yesterday and got a check-up at a local hospital, and Democratic party activists had hoped he would be well enough lift spirits by showing his face in the convention hall or attending some of the festivities surrounding the meeting.</p> <p>Rumours of a possible appearance swirled yesterday and earlier today, and the Associated Press, citing a senior Democratic official, reported this afternoon that Kennedy will watch the tribute video and may address the convention if he feels well enough.</p> <p>\"He's truly humbled by the outpouring of support and wouldn't miss it for anything in the world,\" said Stephanie Cutter, a Kennedy spokeswoman.</p> <p>Kennedy's immune system has been weakened by the course of chemotherapy, and his doctors fear an appearance at the packed convention could endanger his health. But he has prepared a speech and badly wants to deliver it, the Boston Globe reported.</p> <p>Kennedy is wildly popular among Democrats, who admire him for his championing of liberal causes including expanded healthcare. </p> <p>Kennedy also symbolises a bygone era of Democratic dominance in Washington.</p> <p>Democratic leaders hope that a focus on Kennedy will unite a party that has lately been riven with renewed tension among supporters of Hillary Clinton, whom nominee Barack Obama beat after a bitter, 16-month long primary fight.</p> <p>The eight-minute celebratory video, to be shown tonight, was produced by documentary filmmakers Ken Burns and Mark Herzog, and features the senator and his wife Victoria, and interviews with prominent Democrats and others. </p> <p>Caroline Kennedy, who endorsed Obama in January, will speak at the podium about the senator's career and his \"future plans in the United States Senate\", the Democratic party said in a news release.</p> <p>The Massachusetts senator is a scion of the legendary American political family that saw two promising young Democratic politicians assassinated in the 1960s. He is the second most senior member of the Senate and among the most influential backers of Obama during the long primary campaign.</p> <p>Kennedy's brother John was elected president in 1960 and killed in November 1963 as he kicked off his re-election bid. Another brother Bobby, a US senator from New York and attorney general under John Kennedy, was killed in Los Angeles during his 1968 campaign for president.</p> <p>Kennedy was elected to the US senate in 1962, taking over John's seat. He sought to carry the family baton to the White House in 1980, but his challenge to incumbent Democratic president Jimmy Carter failed.</p> <p>In January, Kennedy shook up the Democratic primary race by endorsing Obama, snubbing Clinton. He said Obama would be \"a president who refuses to be trapped in the patterns of the past,\" and said the Illinois senator \"sees the world clearly without being cynical\".</p> <p>The nod was one of the most prized endorsements of the campaign, and leant establishment backing to Obama, a relative newcomer to Washington. </p> <p>The senator suffered a seizure in May and was soon thereafter diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour. Politicians of all stripes were saddened by the news. </p> <p>Early on in his treatment he was photographed with his family and appeared in good spirits, although lately he has receded from the public eye, prompting concerns about his health.</p>",
  "<p>On the first day of what has been designed as a four-day celebration of Barack Obama's historic run for the White House, his compelling biography and achievements, one Democrat dominated. Her name was Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>More than two months after ending her own run for the Democratic nomination, Clinton, it seems, is still not entirely defeated. Or at least the idea of a Clinton presidency isn't.</p> <p>The rancour and divisions between the Clinton and Obama camps were fully exposed today, offering an opening to John McCain that could do serious damage to the Democrats' chances.</p> <p>In Denver, a handful of Clinton supporters \u2014 including the brother of a Colorado senator who is to speak at the convention \u2014 announced they would support McCain. At least two pro-Clinton groups planned street protests today and tomorrow.</p> <p>The McCain campaign released its second ad in 24 hours meant to stoke a sense of grievance among Clinton's supporters at her loss to Obama. </p> <p>All those signs of discontent guarantee that Democratic eyes will be fixed on Clinton when she delivers her prime time address to the convention tomorrow night.</p> <p>It is the start of a two-day process that will honour Clinton's close race against Obama and demonstrate her power as the woman who can help unify Democrats around his candidacy. Tomorrow her name will be in the ballot when the convention holds its traditional roll call vote.</p> <p>The double dose of respect for Clinton was carefully choreographed by the Obama camp as part of its unity effort.</p> <p>A USA Today opinion poll today indicated the challenge Obama and Clinton face in uniting the party. Fewer than half of Clinton's supporters \u2014 47% \u2014 are fully behind Obama. Some 23% say they might change their minds before the election, and 30% say they will vote for McCain or stay home.</p> <p>Established Democrats, elected officials and seasoned delegates who supported Clinton, expect tonight's speech to go some distance towards easing the hostilities.</p> <p>\"I think it will be a unifying moment,\" said Carolyn Maloney, a Democratic congresswoman from New York who campaigned for Clinton in New Hampshire. \"I think it recognises the importance of her race, of 18 million people voting for her.\" <br>Others say the task of uniting the party goes beyond Clinton, and Obama has to do more. \"He is going to have to reinforce his capacity for leadership,\" said Faye Wattleton, founder of the Centre for the Advancement of Women.</p> <p>Clinton's own constituency is also extremely divided. Her nearly 18 million primary voters range from Maloney, who is now firmly on side with Obama, to lukewarm party activists to the minority of die-hard militants who fill fight on even after Clinton tells them to stop tomorrow night.</p> <p>\"We will be looking for cues in what she says,\" said Darragh Murphy, founder of People United Means Action, one of the most militant Clinton groups. \"The last few times she expressed support for Obama, people picked up that she still wants delegates to fight for her.\"<br>Those supporters among the delegates will get their chance to show their support to Clinton in tomorrow night's vote. Clinton has called the vote a \"catharsis\".</p> <p>Daniel Kagan, a supporter and Colorado delegate who started a petition to force the roll call vote, saw it as a way of preserving Clinton's influence inside a party now dominated by Obama loyalists. \"This is a damage limitation exercise,\" he said. </p> <p>Reports said today that Clinton had formally released her delegates, freeing them to vote for Obama. Obama was never in any real danger of losing, but Clinton's decision means that he will be spared the embarrassment of a close vote. </p> <p>\"I'm disappointed,\" Kagan said. \"My sense is that we will lose hundreds of delegates.\" </p> <p>Even so, the prospect of the vote re-opened the scars of defeat for Clinton supporters. So did Obama's decision to choose Joe Biden as his running mate. </p> <p>Many Clinton supporters remain incensed that she was never even vetted for the role. Clinton did little to damp down that anger. </p> <p>That double act \u2014 public expressions of unity beside more private expressions of still raw feelings \u2014 enrages the Obama camp. His faction sees the Clintons almost like old-style vaudeville performers, trying desperately to hang on to the spotlight before being pushed off the stage.</p> <p>Clinton supporters, meanwhile, argue that the Obama camp has failed to reach out to them. \"He hasn't done much to attract my vote,\" said Awilda Marquez, a Colorado delegate who served in Bill Clinton's administration. \"He has consistently said he does not need me.\"</p> <p>Other Clinton supporters describe active hostility: Obama campaign conference calls in which Clinton supporters are described as crazed kamikaze pilots.</p> <p>In reality though, Obama has been winning over Clinton supporters, although it is a painfully slow process. And despite the expressions of false sympathy for Clinton, McCain lags behind Obama by 20 points in his support among women.</p> <p>\"I think after the election many of her supporters, female and male, were in mourning,\" Maloney said. She adds that the Obama camp has intensified its efforts to reach out to women. \"You will see many women in the Barack administration. I know they are reaching out and compiling lists of competent women.\" </p> <p>Clinton's former supporters, even those solidly behind Obama, want more. </p> <p>They remain angry at Obama and the male Democratic establishment for failing to speak out strongly against the sexist commentary from media pundits, or hecklers who asked Clinton to iron their shirts. </p> <p>And it's not clear even then how strongly Clinton's 18 million voters will rally around. \"I'm ready to vote for him,\" said Kagan. \"I'm not very keen. I'm not going to raise funds, I'm not going to phone bank for him, but I will vote.\"</p>",
  "<p>Let's put this as starkly as possible: Hillary Rodham Clinton is a better, smarter, savvier, <em>worthier</em> politician than Ralph Nader. Obvious right? Ridiculous to even point out. The two shouldn't be mentioned in the same sentence. Yet try to tell that to some of Clinton's more rabid supporters. The last thing the precious Clinton legacy needs is to have a coda that tags the senator from the great state of New York as the Nader of 2008.</p> <p>Remember the Nader of 2000? The spoiler? Supported by a handful of super-smart liberals who believed his noxious battle cry that there was no difference between Al Gore and George Bush. It could make you cry just to think of it. By 2004 those Naderites were sufficiently chastised, their candidate relegated to an afterthought, someone whose once-actually-significant contributions were overshadowed by his narcissism. But by then it was much, much too late.</p> <p>For all her acclaimed benevolence in her belated but ultimately gracious acknowledgement of who won the brutal primary battle, the lingering Clinton-Obama rift has left a Nader-like aroma hovering over the opening ceremonies of these 2008 Denver Games. Think a Nader spoiler-scenario can't happen? <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-08-24-campaignpoll_N.htm\">USA Today</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2008/08/24/2008-08-24_new_hillary_clinton_pal_rudy_giuliani_sa.html\">CNN</a> both have ink-fresh polling data showing nearly 30% of Hillary's supporters (and that's of 18 million votes, so not so small!) are now backing senator John McCain. This is ludicrous. Clinton would have been a fine presidential candidate. She fought valiantly to be the first female presidential nominee, and it was hard to see that fall. </p> <p>Yet nothing undermines that effort, that historic feminist attempt as disheartening as her followers found it, than supporting the presumptive Republican nominee. It's hard to imagine what's going through the minds of some of Clinton's more tenacious supporters. A lemming like flocking to McCain - by the day more conservative? More avowedly pro-life, promising the members of Rick Warren's church to honour all zygotes at the moment of conception? More sure of his Iraq position? Member of the disconnected wealthy? (and really, his inability to know the number of houses his wife has been able to secure for him is like George HW Bush's inability to know the price of milk, a gaffe that should haunt him for weeks) \u2013 is this really the legacy they want to promote? Ladies! Please! Backing McCain is a disservice to feminism and a black smear on Clinton's efforts. </p> <p>To be fair to her supporters, the Clintons themselves haven't done enough to dissuade them. One of Hillary's concessions was a biographical film that will run, NBC Olympics montage style, before she addresses the floor tomorrow night. Such hagiographic moments are normally the terrain of those who are actually nominated (Obama) or are in some ways reaching a pinnacle of their careers (as in the case of senator Ted Kennedy, who is expected to deliver a tear-jerker of a performance this evening and cement the Camelot-Obama connection).</p> <p>The film is a bit of somewhat-obnoxious window dressing. I still take issue with the roll call. Today, in the New Republic <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=a8c15050-14b9-4713-aae5-c5a4bd7789a9\"> former Clinton communications maven Howard Wolfson</a> lists the ways in which HIllary has graciously handed the stage to Obama and calls the roll call \"unifying\". \"By encouraging senator Clinton's name to be placed in nomination, senator Obama has shown real respect for her and her supporters,\" Wolfson writes. </p> <p>I still fail to see how letting the party's divisions last into the third and fourth day of the convention \u2013 a convention that Obama really needs to give him the bounce he deserves, and desperately needs \u2013 will help the party. One small but important step has been made: Clinton has indicated she'll release her delegates. This is essential, because beyond all the personalities, this has to be about the party now.</p> <p>Wolfson acknowledges that it is the former President Clinton who hasn't helped on this front. And yet despite nudging Bill to \"offer a strong argument in favour of Obama\", Wolfson puts the burden on Obama to heal rifts by praising the Clinton presidency. This seems to me like placating angry children. Of course the party should acknowledge the Clinton presidency. But most important right now is a recognition that the Democratic party stands for something bigger than Barack Obama, Bill Clinton or Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p> <p>This should be a moment for recognising that the Bush years have been a disaster and that the two parties stand for very different perspectives on what makes America great and will strengthen the country going forward. Not to sound too liberal-kumbaya-ish, but all those in favour of equal rights for all citizens - gay men and lesbians, immigrants and native-born citizens, Americans of all colours and socio-economic classes \u2013 and women's rights over their bodies, a reconsideration of our disastrous healthcare system and a reinvigoration of our engagement in the world around us please place this childish narcissism aside.</p> <p>The Nader mistake can't be made again.</p>",
  "<p>I know just what you're all thinking. You need even more Tomasky video.</p> <p>No? Ah well. Then, for my mother at least, I offer <a href=\"http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/13921?in=23:06&amp;out=28:28\">this link</a> to my recent bloggingheadstv debate with Rich Lowry of the National Review magazine on the effective of Obama's seven-houses attacks, Obama and McCain and abortion, and lots more.</p>",
  "<p>In the second of 1988's presidential debates, Democratic candidate <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2000/debates/history.story/1988.html\">Michael Dukakis was asked the following question</a>: \"Governor, if Kitty Dukakis [his wife] were raped and murdered, would you favour an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?\" </p> <p>Dukakis <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF9gSyku-fc\">replied</a>: \"No, I don't, and I think you know that I've opposed the death penalty during all of my life.\" He went on to discuss the decline in murder statistics in his home state. His answer was coolly delivered, well argued and coherent. It was also disastrous. Dukakis's poll ratings dropped several points the day after, and his answer to that question was blamed by many, including the candidate himself, for his subsequent defeat.</p> <p>It's no mean feat to make George Bush Sr seem emotionally empathetic, but that's what Dukakis did that night, if only by contrast. Instead of betraying any hint of the anger such a scenario might be expected to evoke, Dukakis gave an entirely rational answer. In doing so he came across as a bloodless bureaucrat, a robo-politician with no heart and soul. <em>The guy's asked about what he'd do if his wife is raped and murdered and he barely blinks?</em></p> <p>That moment remains a powerful reminder of the role of anger, and overt emotion generally, in presidential elections. It came to mind last week after the performances of Barack Obama and John McCain at the <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2008/08/saddleback_forum_first_thought.html?hpid=topnews\">Saddleback forum</a>. Of the two, McCain was the more emotionally expressive. He seemed filled with regret as he mentioned the failure of his first marriage, teary when he talked about his time as a captive in Vietnam and fired up with outrage at Russia's treatment of Georgia. Obama's replies, by contrast, were thoughtful, nuanced and impeccably even-toned throughout. McCain was <a href=\"http://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/p-j-gladnick/2008/08/17/leftwing-blogosphere-disappointed-obama-saddleback-forum-performance\">judged by most</a> to be <a href=\"http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MTBjN2RkY2Y3ODZhYmRmYTZjYTI1NTQ4ZGNkM2Y2YmU=\">the night's winner</a>.</p> <p>Democrats are praying that this week's convention is the moment when Americans get to know Obama. But some worry the man often referred to as <a href=\"http://blogs.reuters.com/trail08/2008/03/12/could-no-drama-obama-lead-in-a-crisis/\">\"No Drama Obama\"</a> may be too cool for his own good. Obama's <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/02/AR2008080201687.html?hpid=topnews\">ever-present composure</a> is one of his strengths. It conveys good judgement and grace under pressure. It's also part of the reason that, as an African-American, he's got this far at all. The stereotype of the angry black man berating the white population for its sins is partly why black politicians have found it hard to reach beyond their own racial constituencies. Obama's restraint takes the heat out of racial politics.</p> <p>But it's also a vulnerability. After all, America is in a pretty foul mood itself. Four-fifths of Americans believe their country is headed in the wrong direction. Gas prices are up, and so are foreclosures. People are working harder than ever and have less to spend. Washington is awash with money and broken promises. Voters aren't surveying this mess and raising a quizzical eyebrow. They're thumping the table and demanding change. They want their candidates to feel that anger too.</p> <p>McCain's famously quick temper is often discussed as a liability. If it gets out of control, it might well be. But his high emotional temperature is an advantage in this race if it manifests itself in the right way. He knows this. During the primaries he ran an ad that made a virtue of his reputation for getting mad, declaring that he would use his anger to bring change to Washington.</p> <p>Now, Obama is no Dukakis. He makes speeches that move the spirit as well as stimulate the mind. He's at ease discussing his personal life, his marriage and his kids. But if he's going to persuade the voters he's the man they're looking for this year, he's going to have to step up his emotional intensity. People are willing to believe he understands the nation's problems at an intellectual level. Now they want to know he <em>gets it</em>. Joe Biden is great at conveying empathy, and while Obama won't and shouldn't try to emulate Biden's heart-on-sleeve style, he'll surely be looking for opportunities this week and during the rest of the campaign to show flashes of anger, glimpses of raw emotion.</p> <p>Some will see this as dumbing down. Democrats have traditionally disdained emotionalism in politics, believing it to be a crude weapon used by their opponents to vulgarise reasonable debate. Even as they recognised his genius for communication, many held their nose at Bill Clinton's public displays of empathy. </p> <p>But it's not unreasonable of the public to demand emotion from their politicians. We want our politicians to hear us, and being emotionally empathetic is just another way of signalling that you're a good listener. Look back at that Dukakis answer. He didn't just refuse to engage with the emotional content of that question. He answered a different question altogether.</p> <p>Much of the latest neurological and psychological research tells us that emotion is at the core of our decision-making processes, even when we think we're being rational. So it makes sense to trust politicians who seem emotionally literate. After all, how are you going to negotiate with world leaders, or understand how people choose health insurance, unless you have good instincts for the role of emotion in human behaviour?</p> <p>Politicians need to demonstrate they're one of us. And that means getting angry once in a while.</p>",

  "<p><em>Marc Steiner is in Denver blogging for the <a href=\"http://www.centerforemergingmedia.org/topics/democratic-convention\">Centre for Emerging Media</a>.</em></p> <p>Everyone is fulminating over Joe Biden. Was he a good pick, should it have been Hillary, the negative things he said about Obama in the past \u2026 Will Obama have a bounce after the convention? ... will it be nullified by the RNC? ... blah blah blah.</p> <p>The election starts after Labor Day. The one mystery in this convention will be answered on Tuesday and Wednesday nights when Hillary and Bill speak, respectively. Will they behave, will they support Obama unabashedly and fully? And even more important, will they stand with him on Thursday and pledge to campaign with him. That is the biggest question of this convention. It will be the substance that will make or break this convention, Obama's anticipated awe-inspiring acceptance speech on Thursday, not withstanding. All the rest is pundit window dressing.</p> <p>What makes a difference now is whether Obama can <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-08-24-campaignpoll_N.htm\">stimulate the undecided voters</a> who are not racist and would vote for a black man. The change theme may have worked in the Democratic primary but he has to bring hope with substance to the larger electorate. He has to inspire with creative ideas about how he will rebuild Detroit, create jobs that pay to build new energy, give us our public schools back, and get us out of Iraq with dignity.</p> <p>American voters are as equally divided now as they were in the last four elections. There are more folks than the polls show who would never vote for a black man and can't stand Michelle Obama as strong black woman. But the demographics have changed. There are more Latinos, blacks and young people in the population and voting. If Obama cannot inspire his base to stay with him and come out to vote while convincing those unsure that his message of hope has substance, then welcome John McCain to the White House.</p>",
  "<p>Joe Lieberman gets the possibly crucial <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/25/opinion/25kristol.html?hp\">seal of approval</a> from Bill Kristol, who writes in today's Times that Lieberman's domestic-policy liberalism and support for abortion wouldn't matter because \"McCain has made clear his will be a pro-life administration.\"</p> <p>Many pro-Obama folks I know are certainly cheering for McCain to pick Lieberman on the assumption that conservatives will abandon the ticket in droves. </p> <p>I think that's probably right. The one concern I have about Lieberman is that, jerkazoid that he is, he'll rip into Obama with lusty glee every chance he gets, which would be exactly the opposite of how he behaved alongside Al Gore in 2000. </p>",
  "<p>Liza Mundy at Slate has a <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2198469\">good rundown</a> of the points Michelle Obama needs to hit in her speech tonight. This is the only night with just one major speaker, her, so obviously the Obama people are placing a lot of importance on this.</p> <p>Well, it clearly is important. A black president is one mental hurdle for many white people, but a black first family is, to use a handy American colloquialism, a whole-nother hurdle. People watching MO tonight will be picturing her in their minds presiding over state dinners and giving those televised tours of the White House Christmas decorations. This is one of those intangible factors that will be bouncing around white voters' brain pans to who-knows-what effect.</p> <p>And yet, MO has regularly <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2008/06/michelle_obama.html\">outpolled </a>Cindy McCain on the likeability front, which is somewhat astonishing when you stop and think about it. Cindy McCain is blond, conventionally pretty and was a cheerleader for God's sakes at the <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=University+of+Spoiled+Children\">University of Spoiled Children</a>. </p> <p>So it says something good about America that more people find Michelle appealing, and the people on cable television may well be carrying outdated archetypes in their minds. Wouldn't be the first time.</p>",
  "<p>Senator McCain <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/22/johnmccain.uselections2008\">can't remember</a> how many <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/usa/2008/08/at_home_with_john_and_cindy.html\">homes</a> he owns, but that shouldn't distract voters from the fact that he wants to take away their social security. It is striking to find an adult who has to get help in counting his homes, but that really is less important than the policies that McCain would try to implement if he were elected president.</p> <p>McCain has repeatedly <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/06/13/john-mccain-denies-social_n_106935.html\">expressed interest in privatising social security</a> along the lines proposed by President Bush. For those who have forgotten that nightmare, Bush's plan would have reduced benefits by approximately 1% a year for many workers. </p> <p>Workers who retire 10 years after the plan was put in place would have seen a 10% reduction in benefits compared with the currently projected levels. Workers who retire 20 years after the plan is implemented would see approximately a 20% cut in benefits, and workers who retire 40 years later would see their benefits cut by close to 40%. </p> <p>The losses to retired workers could mean big benefits for the financial industry. Under some versions of the plan, the financial industry would rake in hundreds of billions of dollars in fees and commissions over the next 40 years. According to a recent World Bank analysis, the financial industry pocketed 15-20% of the money paid into the privatised social security system in Chile, which has often been held up as a model by privatisers in the US.</p> <p>Privatisation would be especially painful coming now, in the wake of the collapse of the housing bubble. The huge baby boom cohort that is just now reaching retirement age has seen most of its wealth wiped out by the housing crash. </p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/the-housing-crash-and-the-retirement-prospects-of-late-baby-boomers/\">recent analysis</a> that I did with David Rosnick, my colleague at the Centre for Economic and Policy Research, showed that a typical late baby boomer household (between the ages of 45 and 54) will have less than $100,000 in wealth in 2009. This figure includes 401(k)s, IRAs and other retirement accounts, personal savings and home equity. </p> <p>A relatively small share of these late baby boomers has traditional, defined benefit pensions. In other words, these families are going to have very little to support themselves in retirement other than the social security that McCain is so anxious to cut. </p> <p>There is a reason that social security should be in the news right now. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office just came out with its <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/96xx/doc9649/08-20-SocialSecurityUpdate.pdf\">updated analysis of the programme's finances</a> (pdf). The analysis projects that social security will be able to pay all scheduled benefits through the year 2049, with no changes whatsoever. Even after 2049, when the programme is first projected to face a shortfall, the payable benefit is projected to be more than 30% higher than what the average retiree gets today, and the payable amount would continue to rise from that level every year.</p> <p>The privatisers have worked hard to convince the public that social security is on its last legs, but that is simply a lie. We are going to face many problems that dwarf the dimensions of the projected social security shortfall. For example, the annual cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is approximately three times as large as the annual revenue that would be needed to eliminate the projected social security shortfall.</p> <p>The 2049 date when social security is first projected to face a shortfall is more than three decades after the latest date the next president can leave office. McCain will be 113 when social security is first projected to be unable to pay full benefits. In a country where millions of families are struggling to hang onto their homes, and tens of millions are struggling to pay for healthcare and childcare, a distant and relatively minor problem like the projected social security shortfall hardly warrants centre stage. </p> <p>The public should know that social security is fundamentally sound today and is projected to be sound far into the future. The line about social security going bankrupt is just a scare tactic pushed by the privatisers. </p> <p>It is understandable that people are amused that the Republicans have nominated a presidential candidate who cannot remember how many homes he owns, but the future of social security should be a more important issue in the campaign. McCain will be able to count on a warm place to sleep at night, even if he can never figure out how many homes he owns. The same will not be true for tens of millions of retirees if they allow McCain to carry through with his plans to privatise social security.</p>",
  "<p>At 3:42am Eastern time on Saturday morning, I got a text message from the Obama campaign: \"Barack has chosen Senator Joe Biden to be our VP nominee. Watch the first Obama-Biden rally live at 3pm ET on www.BarackObama.com. Spread the word!\"</p> <p>All very cool, except I had <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/08/23/obamas_text_message_received_w.html\">already known for two hours</a>, and not because I was staking out Biden's house along with CNN. I was just <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,24228589-23109,00.html\">watching CNN</a>. To me, it was another case of \"grasstops\" campaign tactics from a political operation. Pretend to be all people-powered, but in the end, it's politics as usual. And now Barack Obama has my cell phone number, and I'm going to get lots of solicitations. Great for him; a letdown for me. I live in a blue state \u2013 my biggest use to the campaign is as a money source. I accept this as part of the game, but I'm still a sucker for anything that smacks of an inside scoop.</p> <p>In an op-ed in the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/opinion/13graff.html\">New York Times</a>, Garrett Graff wrote recently of Obama's promise to announce his VP pick by text: \"The ploy may seem silly \u2013 the fad candidate adopts the latest tech fad \u2013 but it's an important part of one of Mr Obama's most under-recognised campaign efforts.\"</p> <p>I asked Garrett how he felt about Friday night's outcome: \"Obama missed a great opportunity to create a national moment as supporters got their text messages, got excited and told their friends. He promised this announcement would be different, and the campaign failed to live up to its promise \u2013 that's not a good foot to start off the fall campaign on. He needs to give his supporters ownership, and this time, he blew it.\"</p> <p>Indeed, less than two weeks ago, Obama's campaign manager David Plouffe assured supporters that they would be the first to know who Obama chose for his VP \u2013 via text. I worked for John Kerry in 2004, and we announced the John Edwards VP pick to our supporters via email, then the grassroots technology du jour. We were scooped by the press, but not by much. The emails were cycling through the queue on a Tuesday in July. It felt like a victory for the millions of grassroots, online supporters, although I don't think it was ever recognised as such.</p> <p>On the blog <a href=\"http://www.techpresident.com/blog/entry/28895/barack_s_impersonal_text_disappointing\">TechPresident</a>, Republican strategist David All summed up the Obama text effort in one word: \"Disappointing.\"</p> <p>Yes, the mainstream media scooped the netroots again this time around. The McCain campaign tried to make this about campaign rivalries, as it crowed in a press email:</p> <blockquote> <p>All three networks had confirmed his choice of senator Biden before midnight. And then at 3am, the text messages started going out.</p> <p>By all accounts, Hillary Clinton was not vetted for the second spot, nor was she consulted by the Obama campaign on who should be taken \u2013 not even as a courtesy. If she had been the pick, the 3am text message might have had some real resonance \u2013 a signal that the two had put a tough campaign behind them in order to work together on the serious issues the next administration will have to deal with. </p> <p>But what's with holding the text message until 3am for Joe Biden? The only explanation that makes any sense is that Team Obama just couldn't resist one last dig at Hillary.</p> </blockquote> <p>I think that's probably giving the Obama folks too much credit. The reference to the infamous <a href=\"http://blog.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/03/02/clinton_obama_aides_tangle_ove.html\">primary cycle ad wars between Clinton and Obama</a> (It's 3am. Who do you want answering the phone in the White House?) is for political junkies alone, and a snarky one at that.</p> <p>But there is real implication for the mainstream in Obama's failed text message ploy. Yet again, the technology that empowers the 24/7 news cycle competes with the promise of the netroots. This is a serious challenge for a campaign like Obama's, which relies on its email list for money. Low-dollar fundraising is a careful balance of give and take. I'll give you some money if you make me feel important and useful. That's why non-profit and political fundraising campaigns rely on \"match\" contests and end-of-quarter drives: my small donation feels that much more important when people on the inside take notice.</p> <p>Now, most political laypeople expect Washington to be an inside game. But if you keep promising us access and then not quite getting there, we will lose hope. Garrett references \"ownership\", and this is a key element to the digitally powered campaign. At the core of any successful fundraising messaging is a message of ownership: the donors make the difference. Defy this, and the magic fades. Not to mention, we'll be much less reluctant to give out our cell phone numbers.</p> <p>Just as I was wrapping up this piece, though, I got a lovely little message from Joe Biden, titled \"Hello.\" Loved it. Going to give some money now. Thanks, Joe.</p>",
  "<p>John McCain today held a rally at Central High School in Phoenix, Arizona, with reggaeton star <a href=\"http://www.daddyyankee.com/\">Daddy Yankee</a>.</p> <p>The Puerto Rican rapper, real name Ramon Ayala, thanked McCain and said he was happy to be there. It's unclear to me yet if he performed, but the CNN feed from the event showed several girls on the stage swooning over him.</p> <p>The LA Times <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-celebs3-2008aug03,0,6707693.story\">reported</a> earlier this month that Ayala and the 71-year old Republican, an avowed Abba fan, met in private. McCain spokeswoman Hessy Fernandez, who handles Latino and immigration issues for the campaign, said of the meeting:</p> <blockquote> <p>It goes to show that John McCain is someone who can appeal to anybody.</p> </blockquote> <p>I'll admit I'm baffled on the politics of this one, other than that it's an obvious use of a pop cultural figure to appeal to young voters and Latinos. Expect no more astute analysis from me.</p>",
  "<p>Apologies to the late, great crooner <a href=\"http://www.samcooke.com/\">Sam Cooke</a>. The Obama campaign has released this video telling voters John McCain isn't up to speed on the economy, the petroleum market, and other issues affecting the middle class.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2X9LypdiQFo?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <object height=\"344\" width=\"425\"><param value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/2X9LypdiQFo&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0\" name=\"movie\"/><param value=\"true\" name=\"allowFullScreen\"/><embed height=\"344\" width=\"425\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/2X9LypdiQFo&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0\"/></object> </figure>   <p>For those of you who don't recognise the melody, it's a riff on Sam Cooke's great \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB6V6aUaptI\">Wonderful world</a>\" love song of 1960.</p> <p>Also this morning the Republicans invited members of the press corps covering the Denver Democratic convention to a \"Happy Hour for Hillary\" at a Denver bar. It's part of their effort of late to rub it in Clinton supporters' noses that Joe Biden and not she was chosen as Obama's veep pick.</p> <p>I don't know how much traction the argument will have, but I do give the RNC props for the wit. (An added bonus: their message slogan on the Denver convention is \"A mile high, an inch deep\". That's a reference to Denver's nickname, the mile-high city.)</p>",
  "<p>After the Barack Obama campaign announced early Saturday morning that Delaware senator <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/24/barackobama.joebiden1\">Joseph Biden would fill out the Democratic presidential ticket</a>, an army of merry rightwing photoshoppers went to work. One well-circulated manipulation of an Obama campaign graphic placed the two pols, both with broad smiles, in front of a cut-and-paste crowd. The headline: \"Joe Biden: Old. White. Boring.\"</p> <p>Two for three, I'd say. Biden was born in 1942, giving him nearly 20 years on Obama. He's <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video_log/2008/04/things_younger_than_mccain.html\">not as aged as John McCain</a> (born 1936), but he's no spring turkey either. In fact, everything about Biden, from his <a href=\"http://wonkette.com/401981/joe-biden-is-totally-going-to-be-veep-nominee#more-401981\">hair plugs</a> and capped teeth to his working-class Irish Catholic upbringing to his extremely long tenure in the nation's most exclusive club, screams vain old white guy. But boring? Not on your life.</p> <p>Slate's daily newspaper summary called Biden<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2198476/\"> \"somewhat prone to verbal gaffes\"</a>. That's putting the senator's well-documented taste for shoe leather too softly. One Capitol Hill reporter emailed me: \"In related news, the Grand Canyon is somewhat deep, blue whales are somewhat large, human blood is somewhat red, Michael Phelps is somewhat good at swimming and the earth's core is somewhat hot.\"</p> <p>Biden is a human gaffe machine because he's old and arrogant and has no shame. Most press accounts covered some of his greatest hits, especially those that relate to Obama. Biden called the Illinois senator inexperienced, though he did concede Obama was the very \"first mainstream African-American\" to run for president \"who is articulate and bright and clean.\"</p> <p>Early in his latest bid for the Democratic presidential nod, Biden said that in Delaware, \"You cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent. I'm not joking.\" (Yes he was.) During his first try for the nomination, in 1987, he famously pilfered from the speeches and biography of Labour leader Neil Kinnock, lied about his education and told a voter \"I think I have a much higher IQ than you do\" - while cameras were rolling.</p> <p>Why did Obama pick Biden for his running mate? It's not as if Delaware is in doubt, and a few other VP picks could have put key states in play. Governor Tim Kaine could've given the Democrats a fighting chance in Virginia. Senator Evan Bayh had a very good shot at delivering Indiana. Ohio and Florida looked vulnerable to capture.</p> <p>The Democrat could have put a favourite son on the ticket to push one of those into the blue state column, thus ending the Republicans' tenuous hold on the executive branch. Worse, Obama chose Biden at the same time as it was being reported that his campaign has seriously scaled back advertising in seven states that had voted for George Bush but were considered potential Democratic pick-ups this time in the Electoral College.</p> <p>Obama appears to have picked Biden as his running mate for three reasons. He wanted Biden's foreign policy credentials, he thought Biden could help address his Catholic problem and he needed an attack dog. He may end up unhappy with his choice on all three counts.</p> <p>As chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, Biden knows how to talk a better game than most Democrats on defence issues. However, his idea for what to do about Iraq was a forcible <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/23/AR2006082301419.html\">partition of the country into three de facto states</a>, followed by a fairly quick US withdrawal. The Bush administration and senator McCain rejected that plan in favour of a more unitary approach and a larger military presence.</p> <p>The Biden proposal might have been a good one, but he lost that debate. Many Americans who do not believe that their country should have invaded Iraq in the first place still believe the surge is working. It is perceived to have reduced the violence in Iraq to a level that has allowed some local institutions to find their legs. That slim success might eventually be used by the US to justify withdrawal.</p> <p>And if Obama thought he had a problem with ethnic Catholic voters before, just wait. Expect several bishops to start making noises about excluding the pro-choice Catholic Biden from receiving communion when he campaigns in their dioceses.</p> <p>Biden advocates government neutrality on abortion \u2013 few restrictions but no public funding \u2013 which places him slightly to the right his party platform on the issue. A more humble and clever politician might be able to use, say, his opposition to partial birth abortion to finesse the issue. But this is Joe Biden we're talking about. Not likely.</p> <p>It is true that Biden is more comfortable playing the role of impugner and attacker than Obama. In the primaries, he accused former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani of being a demagogue whose sentences must contain \"a noun, a verb and 9/11\". In his Illinois speech on Saturday, Biden needled McCain over the seven houses that the second wife of the Arizona senator reportedly owns.</p> <p>These Biden lines aren't bad in themselves. However, play them again on YouTube and listen closely. One is apt to notice Biden's delivery takes most of the bite out of them. Republicans may soon feel not so much mauled by a vicious attack dog as gummed by a clown.</p>",
  "<h2>Live from the Democratic convention </h2> <p>The atmosphere on the streets of downtown Denver ahead of the convention opening today was a strange mixture: part carnival, part tense confrontation between anti-war protesters and hundreds of heavily armed police, many in riot gear ... and, amid it all, the most extensive orgy of Barack Obama-themed merchandising I've yet witnessed. Almost none of it was official: every smalltime entrepreneur within a 500-mile radius, it seemed, had brought a suitcase full of t-shirts, baseball caps, buttons or tea towels - and even the atrociously designed ones will probably find buyers among the 50,000 delegates and countless others expected today in Denver's Pepsi Centre.</p> <p>With no sign of a \"Biden bounce\" in the polls, the pressure on Obama to maintain Democratic unity this week will be even greater, says <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/25/barackobama.joebiden\">Suzanne Goldenberg in today's Guardian</a>.</p> <p>A much-rumoured surprise appearance by Ted Kennedy at the convention tonight could certainly help do that: if his doctors give him permission to attend, it'll be the emotional high point of the day. So might the decision late yesterday to give Michigan and Florida delegates full voting rights - far too late, of course, to make anything but a symbolic difference. The Associated Press is also reporting that Hillary Clinton has released all her delegates to vote as they please in the roll-call vote, meaning that some might switch to Obama.</p> <h2>Today at the convention</h2> <p>Monday's official convention theme is '\"One Nation\", with a focus on Obama's biography - \"a life of struggle, responsibility and opportunity like those faced by Americans every day.\" Michelle Obama is the headline speaker; other highlights include Barack Obama's sister, Maya Soetero-Ng, and his brother-in-law, Craig Robinson, along with House speaker Nancy Pelosi.

Meanwhile, there's no point linking to StayRedKansas.com: the Kansas politics blog was so confident in its prediction that Obama would choose Evan Bayh as his running-mate that it promised to shut down if he didn't. He didn't. It did.</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>Obama maintains a narrow lead over McCain - 49% to 45% - in a Washington Post/ABC poll, while Gallup's tracking poll, partly conducted after Joe Biden emerged as Obama's running-mate, is tied, 45% to 45%. The Washington Post poll gave McCain a strong lead on foreign policy know-how: voters believe he's the more knowledgeable candidate by a ratio of two to one.</p> <h2>Quote of the day</h2> <p>Barack Obama rolled out some ostentatious modesty in response to the soaring expectations for Thursday's nomination acceptance event: \"I am still tooling around with my speech a little bit. I may not be as good as the other headliners the other three nights, but hopefully it'll make clear the choices the American people are going to face in November.\"</p> <h2>... and on the Convention fringes</h2> <p>It's day two of Mediate 08, an all-convention-long interfaith meditation retreat in a park near the Pepsi Centre. Recreate 68, the activist group behind many of Sunday's protests, plans a mid-morning march. And delegates can enjoy 'Sex, Politics and Cocktails', an event hosted by Planned Parenthood - so that's safe sex, presumably.</p>"
