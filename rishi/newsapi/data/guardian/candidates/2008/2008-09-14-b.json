  "<p>As the longest US presidential campaign in history enters its final 50 days, the world is watching Barack Obama and John McCain battle it out. But America is watching its media chase after something else entirely: the saga of Sarah Palin. The hunt may be unedifying for some but it has raised questions about the media's role in a heated climate where charges can't always be fact-checked.</p> <p>Since castigating the press in her national political debut, Palin has given just one mainstream interview, to ABC news. Yet lack of access has only led to more attention, giving liberals heartburn and conservatives fuel for attacks on the media.</p> <p>\"Her critics like to say that Palin hasn't accomplished anything,\" Arianna Huffington blogged. \"I disagree. In the space of ten days she's succeeded in distracting the entire country from the horrific Bush record - and McCain's complicity in it.\"</p> <p>The early numbers suggest Palin has indeed crowded out other stories. She was the subject of 60% of US news stories during the Republican party convention, according to the independent Pew research centre, even more than McCain and three times as many as Obama in the same week.</p> <p>Palin's unexpected nomination, combined with the relative exoticism of her Alaskan roots, made the media fascination somewhat inevitable. The questions mounted: did she raise taxes as mayor of Wasilla, Alaska? How much government money did she seek to study seal DNA? Where did she get her children's names from?</p> <p>\"Let's not underestimate how much of a surprise she was,\" warns Mark Jurkowitz, associate director of the Pew centre's Project For Excellence in Journalism. \"Not just to the political chattering class, but also to the media itself. You're getting this rush of information - some gossip, some rumours, some of it important, all of it coming out in a small timeframe.\"</p> <p>Indeed, the way her quick ascension sent the press into a tizzy has led the gun-toting mother of five to be compared with Obama.</p> <p>More important than the Palin-mania of the 24-hour news cycle is the Republican campaign's savvy use of her popularity, however. Before she uttered a word to the voting public, McCain aides refused to answer media questions about Palin's record, deeming them too sexist.</p> <p>US reporters and commentators may have called it a \"marketing ploy\" - in CNN president Jon Klein's words - but they were left wondering how to cover a candidate who demonised them.</p> <p>\"There's a rhetorical case the McCain campaign has made, that shock [at Palin's nomination] was similar to disapproval,\" Clint Hendler, a staff writer at the Columbia Journalism Review, says. \"I don't think that's true. But they've blurred the line there, because it's advantageous to them to draw a parallel between the 'good-old-boy' network in Alaska and the 'good-old-boy' network in the media.\"</p> <p>Perhaps ironically, it also meant that the support given to Obama by liberal bloggers during his campaign against Hillary Clinton was used against him by Palin supporters.</p> <p>The mainstream media cannot ignore popularity. Her convention speech was watched by an eye-popping 37.2 million US TV viewers. (The finale of American Idol, by contrast, attracted just 31.7 million.) In the speech, she launched cutting broadsides at the media, emboldening Republicans in the crowd to vent their anger over perceived liberal bias at the MSNBC network.</p> <p>The marquee pundits at MSNBC, the third biggest news channel after CNN and Fox, dismissed Palin's vitriol. Keith Olbermann sighed at the Republican \"picking of fights\". Chris Matthews shrugged: \"This is showbiz. They know what they're doing. It might work.\"</p> <p>Within days, Olbermann and Matthews had been removed from their anchor chairs for the rest of the election season, despite being hugely popular with younger viewers. Paul Waldman, a senior fellow at the watchdog group Media Matters, says: \"The problem is, you had all this protest coming from the right\" even before Palin's speech. \"When you make the shift in the wake of that, it looks like you're trying to compensate and knuckle under.\" The ripple effect of Palin's rise has grown more intense as the US media tries to find its rudder in a sea of short-lived campaign scandals. Scrutiny of her record has turned up a slew of contradictions. As hypocrisies emerge, liberals have joined conservatives in chastising the press - albeit for very different reasons.</p> <p>Democratic partisans cried foul, for example, when the media quoted Palin's claim to have terminated an expensive Alaskan bridge project. A simple Google search confirms that she actually supported the bridge. \"The US mainstream media is very much a prisoner of a perhaps obsolete idea of balance,\" says the CNN analyst and New Yorker writer Jeffrey Toobin.</p> <p>\"For the most part, the media is very uncomfortable saying that one side is right and one side is wrong, even on factual matters like this one.\"</p> <p><strong>Sexist jibe</strong></p> <p>While liberals seethed about Palin's bridge claim, conservatives were pouncing on any press criticism of the vice-presidential candidate as sexist. Wary of having their words twisted into a gaffe, Obama aides steered clear of Palin - but Obama himself stepped into a trap on Tuesday by calling Republican rhetoric \"lipstick on a pig\".</p> <p>The McCain camp promptly accused him of a sexist jibe, which the mainstream media felt bound to report despite the fact that it is a common expression in the US. And though the mainstream media had spent a week rebutting sex-bias charges, Obama got no such help in the wake of the remark.</p> <p>Cable TV dedicated hours of airtime to questioning whether Obama's use of the US colloquialism referred to Palin, who often jokes that hockey mums like herself are pit bulls in \"lipstick\". The Associated Press wrote that Obama was \"clearly drawing a connection to Palin's joke, even if it's not what [he] meant\".</p> <p>Tom Patterson, professor of government and the press at Harvard University, says the media's focus on trivialities is dragging down its credibility with the public. \"The problem is that on cable, which is usually the driver of news content, they love this stuff,\" he adds. \"The press, because it needs to feed the 24-hour beast, has almost lost its compass, and the public recognises it.\"</p> <p>Academics are not alone in questioning the media's self-control in the post-Palin era. When politico.com asked senior Republicans and Democrats about the coverage of the sexism furore, both sides said the press response was utterly predictable. It is clear that the US press - with the unusual exception for a serious political candidate of Us, OK! and People - has not yet figured out how to approach Palin two weeks after she burst onto the scene.</p> <p>Palin's debut interview on ABC last week highlighted all these tribal divisions - between the sexes and the parties - that have been shown up by her brief career in the national spotlight. As she prepares to debate with her Democratic counterpart on October 2, the mainstream media will again have to weigh their desire for a great story against the risk of more attacks on alleged bias. And with the compass spinning through a fast-changing media landscape ahead of the elections on November 4, time is running out.</p>",
  "<p>About \u00a31bn in western aid to revive Zimbabwe's economy will hang in the balance today as western donors watch to see how a power-sharing deal to be signed by President Robert Mugabe works in practice before committing a rescue package.</p> <p>Under the deal with his arch-rival Morgan Tsvangirai, Mugabe is to surrender many of his powers for the first time in 28 years. But though the agreement, to be formally signed today, marks a huge climbdown by Mugabe, foreign donors indicated that they want to see just how much power Tsvangirai wields as the new prime minister in the coalition government.</p> <p>\"We want to see this government in action before we commit our support to it,\" said a European diplomat in Harare. \"We need to see Mugabe is not continuing to run things. There will be benchmarks, litmus tests of who's really in charge.\"</p> <p>Donors, including Britain, the EU and the US, are broadly agreed to inject about \u00a31bn in aid over a year to reverse more than a decade of economic decline that has brought inflation above 20,000,000%, mass unemployment, empty supermarket shelves and forced about 4 million people to leave the country to find work. </p> <p>Agriculture has collapsed, leaving millions without sufficient food and reducing many to one meal every other day.</p> <p>Tsvangirai will be keen to see the foreign money as soon as possible in the hope of bolstering public support by swiftly moving to alleviate people's misery. </p> <p>The power-sharing agreement brokered by the South African president, Thabo Mbeki, gives the opposition a majority of one in the cabinet and places Tsvangirai in charge of the daily administration of government. </p> <p>When the 31 cabinet posts are divided in the coming days, Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change is likely to win control of the finance ministry because Mugabe recognises the donors will not want to see a Zanu-PF minister in charge of their funds. But diplomats say that their governments will be looking for other signs that Tsvangirai is in control. </p> <p>One test will be if the MDC gains authority over the police and if it is able to remove the highly partisan police commissioner, Augustine Chihuri, who said he would not salute Tsvangirai if he were elected president and whose force played an active part in the bloody assault on opposition supporters during the election. </p> <p>Western donors are also keen to see the governor of the central bank, Gideon Gono, sacked because of his alleged role in the plunder of the country's hard currency reserves and fuelling inflation by furiously printing money.</p> <p>Nonetheless it will be difficult for western countries to turn their back on today's watershed agreement because they risk being accused of failing to accept an African-mediated settlement. The evident hostility and suspicion with which Mugabe regards Tsvangirai and the expectations of western governments was evident in a column in the state-run Herald newspaper by the president's spokesman, George Chiramba, under a pseudonym. It called the MDC in government the \"enemy within\" and accused it of taking its orders from Britain and other powers.</p> <p>\"For a party that has always relied on government and intellect for policy incubation, [Zanu-PF] has to learn to govern in a new environment where the enemy is within, well embedded,\" Chiramba wrote. \"The west will now have an eager listening post, right up to cabinet. There will be lots of policy pre-emption.\"</p> <p>Many Zimbabweans are cautious about the political settlement. Lining up for bread in shops with otherwise bare shelves, or queuing for the pitiful 50p-worth of currency they are permitted to withdraw from the bank each day, people are desperate for reasons to hope.</p> <p>However, men such as Arthur Mubaiwa, who was part of a very long queue for petrol yesterday, say they know Mugabe and they do not have full confidence in Tsvangirai.</p>",
  "<p>For Thabo Mbeki, it could have been the day that restored a reputation battered by perverse policies on HIV/Aids and Machiavellian strategies: the signing of a deal he brokered to end Zimbabwe's political crisis and silence those who scorned his \"quiet diplomacy\" with Robert Mugabe. </p> <p>Instead, South Africa's president will spend this week fighting for his political life as his party debates whether to remove him from office after a damning court ruling that accused Mbeki of apartheid-style tactics in illegally abusing the justice system to try and prevent Jacob Zuma from becoming the country's next leader.</p> <p>The agreement in Zimbabwe today is a major triumph for Mbeki who managed to press Mugabe into conceding many of his powers to Morgan Tsvangirai. But that will count for little at home as leaders of Mbeki's African National Congress decide his future following Friday's ruling in which a high court judge, Chris Nicholson, threw out corruption charges against Zuma and said that the prosecution was the result of \"baleful political influence\". </p> <p>Nicholson said that Mbeki and members of his cabinet had abused the prosecuting authority in an attempt to remove Zuma from the \"titanic political struggle\" for control of the ANC. The judge likened Mbeki's actions to those of apartheid-era governments for inducing two successive heads of the prosecutions authority to commit \"a very serious criminal offence\" by pursuing a political prosecution.</p> <p>\"In terms of the law, more especially emanating from the constitution, there is responsibility attributable to the president,\" the judge said.</p> <p>Now Zuma and his supporters are preparing to take revenge on Mbeki. The ANC national executive and its trade union confederation and Communist party allies are to discuss his future this week. The ANC's chief whip in parliament, Nathi Mthethwa, told Johannesburg's City Press newspaper that it is not a question of if, but when, the party will move against Mbeki. </p> <p>\"As a leader of the ANC, you cannot be implicated of [sic] plotting the downfall of your comrade and people then pretend as if nothing has happened,\" he said.</p> <p>A senior ANC leader told Johannesburg's Sunday Times newspaper that Mbeki had to go. \"The most obvious (position) would be to appoint a delegation that will ask him to step down,\" he said. </p> <p>Another ANC official told the paper that Mbeki would \"be pushed on (to) his sword if he can't fall on his sword\". Mbeki can be removed through a vote of no confidence or by calling an early election. The ANC holds 293 of the 400 seats in parliament so if the party leadership decided to force the president out it could almost certainly win the necessary majority among ANC MPs with an eye to their future selection as candidates at the next election. </p> <p>If that happened, the speaker would become acting president until parliament elected a new president, almost certainly Zuma. If an early election is called instead, Mbeki would remain president until the vote within 90 days.</p>",
  "<p>I'm sure you've heard the news. The cold war is back. Or history has returned. Or we're now in the 19th century world of great power politics. Russia's attack on Georgia has unleashed a barrage of cliches. Globalisation and integration have been exposed as shams. Our naive idea that we were living in a benign international environment has been shattered.</p> <p>Most of this commentary is a massive overreaction. Who in the past few decades believed that international life has been problem-free? John McCain ominously intoned that the Russian attack was the \"first serious crisis since the end of the cold war\". Really? What about the attacks of 9/11, not to mention the Iraq war, the Balkan wars, the genocide in Rwanda?</p> <p>There has been a deep yearning for a return of history. We all miss that world of good and evil, ideological struggle and high stakes. And it's certainly true that international life has changed. But what is new is the acceleration of global capitalism and trade, and the remarkable growth this is producing across the globe. </p> <p>In 2006 and 2007, 124 countries recorded economic growth of 4% a year or more. This is utterly unprecedented, and is giving rise to a new, genuinely global international order. After two decades of unipolarity - with America dominating the globe economically, politically, culturally, and militarily - we are moving into a post-American world, one shaped in many lands and by many people. Within a period of one month, India flexed its muscles to derail the global trade talks, China put on the greatest show on earth in Beijing, and Russia attacked its neighbour. </p> <p>But in order to understand properly the age in which we live, we must stop making bad analogies. This is not a return to the 19th century, when Russian actions would have been standard operating procedure for a great power. In fact, only 50 years ago Britain and France clung to their empires - in Algeria, Vietnam, Kenya, Cyprus - with more determination and violence than Moscow. This is the first time since the break-up of the Soviet Union that Moscow has sent troops into a neighbouring country (a country that it had ruled since 1801). Its actions are deplorable but the reaction to them - worldwide - is a sign of how much the rules have changed.</p> <p>The countries bordering Russia all condemned the move and rallied around Nato, the European Union, and the US. Even Belarus is making some friendly gestures westward.</p> <p>Far from revealing a new \"alliance of autocracies\", as Robert Kagan had prophesied, the crisis has shown how divergent are the interests of China and Russia. Beijing expressed dismay at the attack and helped provide loans to Georgia. Central Asia's dictatorships also distanced themselves from Moscow's actions. And Russia's stock market has been battered, its currency has sunk, foreign investment has dried up, and for years to come businessmen will view it as a great risk to do business there.</p> <p>Why is this happening? Poland is doing well, Kazakhstan is a natural resource power, the Baltics are booming. They are connected to a larger world and will not meekly accept Russia's \"privileged sphere\". </p> <p>It has always been possible for big countries to push around their neighbours - something the US has not been exempt from itself. What's new now is that there are growing political, economic, and financial costs to such actions, unless they have widespread legitimacy. That will not always deter a great power, but it certainly will make them think. There are already signs that some in Russia's ruling elite are wondering whether 70,000 South Ossetians have been worth all this.</p> <p>We are not entering a new cold war. And if we do, the second time will be farce. Russia is a much smaller part of the world than it was when it launched the first one. In the late 1940s, the Soviet Union had the world's largest army and comprised between 15% and 20% of global GDP. Today Russia has a much smaller armed force and makes up a bit more than 2% of global GDP. If there is to be a period of tension between Russia and the west, the outcome is predetermined.</p> <p>The forces of globalisation are, in fact, producing an extraordinary degree of integration around the world. The broader challenge is that growth being produced by this globalisation is everywhere producing political nationalism and assertiveness. These forces can be benign and constructive - when we like them we call them patriotism and cultural pride - but they can also be aggressive and xenophobic. The central tension of the world we live in will be between the forces of global integration on the one hand and those of nationalism on the other.</p> <p>But history doesn't repeat itself. It only seems to do so to people who don't know the details. We're in the 21st century and it will not look like the 19th or 18th centuries. Our problems will be different. We live in times of extraordinary prosperity (more broadly shared across the globe than ever before) and yet filled with perils - from terrorism to climate change. It doesn't scare me, but it does make me wish we had better leaders.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Fareed Zakaria is the editor of Newsweek International and author of The Post-American World <a href=\"mailto: comments@fareedzakaria.com\">comments@fareedzakaria.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Few were surprised when Rupert Murdoch's New York Post, part of a US News Corp empire led by the Wall Street Journal and Fox News, endorsed John McCain last week. But the timing of the nod - the staunchly conservative Post had waited to back George Bush for president until late October of 2000 and 2004 - was surprising.</p> <p>The Post's endorsement came days after Murdoch biographer Michael Wolff reported that the 77-year-old News Corp chairman had played peacemaker between Fox News and Barack Obama, paving the way for the Democrat to sit down with conservative host Bill O'Reilly.</p> <p>Wolff's declaration in Vanity Fair magazine that \"Murdoch is becoming a liberal - sort of\" got tongues wagging on both sides of the Atlantic. Was the media mogul ready, as Murdoch hinted at his Dow Jones conference in May, to vote for Obama? The Post's pro-McCain headline appeared to answer that question in the negative. Wolff is now left wondering whether his remark on Murdoch's changing politics prompted a backlash out of \"irritation that I perceived him as becoming a liberal\".</p> <p>\"I don't think Rupert Murdoch likes people to tell him what they think he's going to do,\" Wolff said in an interview. \"Would he change his political inclinations to make that clear? Yeah, I think Rupert can be a little bit of a bitch.\"</p> <p>But Wolff also noted that Murdoch views the Post's readership as naturally inclined against Obama, particularly on the question of how hawkish the US should be to defend Israel. \"So it's probably a combination of factors\" driving the Post's harsh dismissal of Obama.</p> <p>Of course, few in America expect Fox News to soften its coverage of Obama in the wake of his rapprochement with the network. Hours after the Democratic nominee sat down with O'Reilly, a Fox host threatened to \"shut down the microphone\" of a senior Obama adviser during an on-air appearance. </p> <p>Another development that would shock even seasoned Murdoch watchers is an endorsement of either party in the Wall Street Journal, now that the newspaper has become part of News Corp. Despite its famously conservative opinion page, the Journal has not endorsed any presidential candidate since Herbert Hoover - best known in the US for bringing on the 1930s Great Depression. Will Robert Thomson, who took a decidedly New Labour line when editor of the Times, make history and back a candidate for the US election?</p>",
  "<p>It was, she said, the \"trip of a lifetime\". The young governor from the remote state engaged in her own brand of shuttle diplomacy in the summer of 2007, even posing, gun in hand, with some of her loyal troops in a far-off land.</p> <p>But this weekend, the story of Alaska governor and Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin's trip to Ireland, Germany, Kuwait and Iraq began to shrink under scrutiny. Interrogated about hazy details of the itinerary - the first time she had travelled outside of north America - campaign officials acknowledged that Palin had not entered Iraq, but had instead visited Alaska national guard troops at a border crossing with Kuwait.</p> <p>\"You have to have permission to go into a lot of areas, and [the crossing] is where her permissions were,\" Alaska national guard colonel Dave Osborn told the Boston Globe. As for the trip to Ireland, well that was little more than a refuelling stop. </p> <p>The admission by the John McCain-Palin camp further dents her foreign policy credentials. The campaign has made much of her experience dealing with Russia and Canada, both countries that border Alaska. But in an interview broadcast last week, her first television interview since becoming McCain's running mate, Palin indicated that her knowledge of Russia was restricted to being able to see it from Alaska. It now appears that her knowledge of Iraq has its foundation in her being able to see it from Kuwait.</p> <p>The latest revelation about Palin's travels came as several newspapers continued to investigate her tenure as the mayor of a small town in Alaska and her two years as governor of the state. The New York Times accused her of cronyism and carrying out vendettas against her political foes.</p> <p>Undaunted, or perhaps buoyed by the controversies surrounding her candidacy, Palin campaigned alone for the first time at the weekend in Nevada, a crucial swing state. Both she and the Democratic presidential nominee, Barack Obama, were due to campaign in Colorado, another western swing state, today.</p> <p>Despite a week of adverse news in the media and opinion polls, the Obama campaign was able to announce yesterday that it had broken its own fundraising record in the month of August, pulling in $66m (\u00a337m) during the month.</p> <p>More than half a million new donors helped to raise the total, a campaign spokesman announced.</p>",
  "<p>David Foster Wallace was not necessarily the \"literary voice of Generation X\", as he was once billed, but he wrote perhaps his generation's most audacious novel, and, along with Richard Powers, was a throwback to the excitement of the early post-modernist \"metafictions\" of Thomas Pynchon, Don DeLillo or John Barth. </p> <p>His death, at the age of 46, apparently by his own hand, came as a shock in US literary circles, although he confessed in interviews to having undergone one \"suicide scare\" 20 years before. In his best-known novel, Infinite Jest (1996), three of the main characters, the Incandenza Brothers, labour under the shadow of their father's suicide, a failure of his communication with them. Wallace's work was often built around the difficulties of communicating.</p> <p>Infinite Jest was only Wallace's second novel. His first, The Broom of the System (1987), grew out of his thesis in English at Amherst College, Massachusetts, where he also majored in philosophy. His philosophy thesis, on modal logic, received the college's prestigious Gail Kennedy prize. Not surprisingly for someone who first taught at a college in Normal, Illinois, and later held the Roy E Disney chair of creative writing at Pomona College, in California, Wallace's novels are laced with irony, often delivered through extensive footnotes, accommodating epic diversions. This ironic mode balances loftier themes with the more mundane concerns of popular culture: in Infinite Jest, virtually every aspect of life in North America has been taken over by corporate sponsors.</p> <p>Wallace was born in Ithaca, New York, where his father, James, was studying for a doctorate in philosophy at Cornell. James Wallace became a renowned professor at the University of Illinois, while David's mother, Sally, taught literature at a nearby community college. David was a regionally ranked junior tennis player, and followed in his father's footsteps to Amherst. He received a master's degree in writing from the University of Arizona in 1987, and began studying for a PhD in philosophy at Harvard, but left before completing the degree. </p> <p>Although he had published a novel, and some short stories, and, in 1987, won the Whiting Writers' Award, by the end of the 1980s Wallace's life was in a downward spiral which included at least one stay in a psychiatric hospital. He later characterised his generation as being full of people like himself, \"successful, obscenely well-educated, and sort of adrift\".</p> <p>In 1991 he began working on Infinite Jest. \"I wanted to do something sad,\" he said, \"real American, about what it's like to live in America around the millennium.\" The following year, he moved to Normal to teach at Illinois State University. Although he finished it in 1993, his massive manuscript was cut by nearly a third, and published only in 1996. Despite, or perhaps because of, its size, it was a massive hit, and Wallace was rewarded with a MacArthur \"genius\" grant, and a Lannan prize.</p> <p>He said he aimed for a middle ground between writers he described as \"avant-garde ... writing just for other writers\" and those who produced \"crass cynical commercial fiction\", believing that both were driven by \"contempt for their audience\". But success created another problem; this popular cult writer described himself as \"agoraphobic\".</p> <p>In 2002 he moved to Pomona, where a lighter teaching load allowed him more privacy and time to pursue journalistic projects. He wrote about David Lynch for Premiere, holiday cruises for Harper's, the US Open for Tennis magazine, and covered John McCain's 2000 campaign for Rolling Stone. His essays have been collected in four books; the McCain article, reprinted in Consider the Lobster (2005), was expanded into a separate book, McCain's Promise, released just a few days before the writer's death. </p> <p>Although he published two collections of short stories, most recently Oblivion (2004), he had gone 12 years without producing another novel. </p> <p>In 2005 Wallace, invited to address a graduating class at Kenyon College, Ohio, told them that the purpose of education was to teach \"how to keep you from going through your comfortable, prosperous, respectable, adult lives dead, unconscious, a slave to your ... natural default setting of being uniquely, completely, imperiously alone\". His wife, Karen Green, found him dead at their home in California.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>David Foster Wallace, writer, born February 21 1962; died September 12 2008</p>",

  "<p>The presidential elections are considered the best show in the US right now, offering much entertainment based on drama with some comic highlights. But in truth they are in stiff competition with a much longer-running show: the US Air Force (USAF) Tanker bidding war, which has become a farce \u2013 not of the French variety of mistaken identities, but rather more of a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dario_Fo\">Dario Fo</a> creation, in which serious issues are decided on the basis of narrow interests, ignorance, and often greed, compounding into a ludicrous and ultimately sad outcome. </p> <p>An awesome illumination of this reality was given this week by defence secretary Robert Gates, who decided to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/11/business/11tanker.html?partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss\">postpone the bidding yet again</a>, till next year, when he and his cohorts are safely out of the way.</p> <p>To the uninitiated, the chronology of the Tanker farce can be summarised thus: the USAF, which is based upon an ability to project force all around the world, has long needed to replace its air-refuelling fleet, which currently dates back to the 1960s. The project is worth an initial $35bn, adding up to a potential $100bn over time. In real terms there are only two companies in the world capable of supplying the full requirement: Boeing and Airbus. Boeing is a US-based company, Airbus is European, so for the purposes of the bid a consortium was created between EADS, its mother company, and US-based aerospace manufacturer Northrup Grumman (NG).</p> <p>The first tender was issued some seven years ago, but the highly political bidding process ended in fiasco when it transpired that a US Department of Defence senior procurement official favoured Boeing by upping its price and supplying the company with information about the competing Airbus bid. The official ended up in jail and the tender was suspended. Senator John McCain, the current Republican presidential candidate, was instrumental in exposing the fraud, stopping the first tender, and finally launching a second in January 2007, to be decided on cost and merit alone. </p> <p>In February this year, once again after a very charged bidding process that sprawled across the entire US political system, the second tender was decided in favour of the EADS-NG consortium. This <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/03/06/business/06tanker.php\">stunned</a> the political establishment, which more or less assumed Boeing would get the order, but the USAF stood by its decision that on merit the winner submitted the best proposal. In March Boeing appealed the decision to the Government Accounting Office (GAO), which in mid-June upheld the challenge and asked the USAF to reopen the tender. On August 6, it did \u2013 with largely similar, if not near-identical specifications to the previous one, and a deadline of two months, with a decision by year-end. </p> <p>Having lost the previous round with these specifications, Boeing threatened to pull out of the bidding \u2013 claiming it would not have enough time to create a bid based on a different aircraft \u2013 which would have left only one bidder, a nightmare scenario for such a public tender. (In 2007 EADS threatened to withdraw, after the first tender fiasco, and had to be coaxed back in.) Finally, on September 10, Gates threw in the towel, terminating the competition and leaving it to the next administration to restart.</p> <p>This farcical process has left a lot of damage in its wake, and not only to the reputation of the procurement arm of the USAF \u2013 whose chief was fired after the GAO findings. However big the tender, the repeated inability to run it within accepted parameters is simply incredible, especially for the biggest defence complex in the world. That said, while the first tender was clearly criminally afflicted, the flaws of the second, while unacceptable, were focused not on the winning aircraft but on the decision-making process, in what even the GAO defined as a close competition. And that is the real crux of the matter: the two sides are nearly equal in capability, so it is pure politics combined with a modicum of human error that are now the deciding factors. </p> <p>The February decision to favour EADS caused a huge and increasingly vitriolic outcry in the US, where many claimed national security and many jobs would be put at risk \u2013 outsourced to Europe, even though EADS-NG repeatedly claimed most of the planes would be built in the US, creating many thousands of new jobs. John McCain <a href=\"http://www.globalsecurity.org/org/news/2003/031125-boeing-scandal.htm\">was accused</a> of having an EADS lobbyist on his staff, while both Hillary Clinton and Barak Obama \u2013 then battling it out in the primaries \u2013 decried the decision as effectively against the national interest. In addition, it was often noted that Airbus and Boeing are already in official dispute in the World Trade Organisation, with each side suing the other for use of unfair subsidies \u2013 and that therefore favouring EADS in the tender would undermine the Boeing case in Geneva. In short, there was rage against the presumption of Europe to play in the US.</p> <p>The GAO <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/press/press-boeing2008jun18_3.pdf\">decision</a>, and Gates's latest suspension decision, are deemed to be against EADS-NG, firstly because its win is effectively annulled; second because it will probably be at least a year until a new tender is issued; and third therefore, because it stands to not make a substantial amount of money. Under normal circumstances these should be considered no more than the vagaries of business, but this is different. For what is at stake now is not only a lot of money and jobs, but a fundamental principle: is the US open to international competition in government, and especially defence, procurement? It expects Europe and all other continents and states to open their markets to its defence products, with understandably extremely strict technology-transfer restrictions \u2013 but it appears to many in various European capitals and Brussels that it is simply unwilling to reciprocate. </p> <p>Both presidential candidates have so far kept very quiet on Gates's decision, with neither probably relishing have to make the decision. On the other hand, they could be satisfied in knowing that whatever decision they make, they stand to contribute to one of the best political farces running.</p>"
