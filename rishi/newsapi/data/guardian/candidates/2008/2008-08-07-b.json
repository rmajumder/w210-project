  "<p>It has been an intriguing seven days in that peculiar subsection of American society where politics and celebrity meet. First, John McCain got all up in Paris Hilton's grill, forcing the heiress to respond by unleashing the devastating comedic powers already </p> <p>demonstrated in her blistering contribution to the genre of satirical cinema, The Hottie and the Nottie. Then Scarlett Johansson blasted the \"extreme sexism\" of the media for suggesting that there was something flirtatious about her recent claims that she was conducting a \"personal\" email dialogue with Barack Obama: clearly the email passed to Lost in Showbiz -- \"OMG Barack u r 100% lush and AWESOME!!!!! Me and my m8s luv ur plans to simplify filing of income tax returns by pre-filling wage and bank information </p> <p>already collected by the IRS ur wife is well lucky\" -- was a fake. </p> <p>But all that stuff is a mere bagatelle when compared with what's going on in the current </p> <p>issue of Harper's Bazaar magazine. There, former supermodel Tyra Banks has posed for a lengthy pictorial as would-be First Lady Michelle Obama, complete with mocked-up Oval Office set, and looky-likeys of Barack and the Obama children.</p> <p>Anyone understandably baffled by this turn of events is directed to the accompanying </p> <p>article. It appears beneath the ineffably menacing strapline \"from the runway to the catwalk, EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE for Tyra Banks\", which somehow gives the pictures the feel not of a homage, but of the photographs police find when raiding a stalker's bedsit, from which the accused has cut out their victim's spouse and crudely Pritt-sticked in a picture of themselves. The sense that you are witness to something slightly sinister is not a notion the text does much to disabuse you of, not least because it keeps carrying on as if Banks is actually angling for the job of First Lady: \"Ms Banks would bring some fierce grace to the White House. But she would be ever of </p> <p>the people.\" </p> <p>But lest anyone infer a certain creepiness about the proceedings, Banks is quick to set the record straight by lauding Obama -- \"one hot mama\" -- and carefully detailing her most important qualities: \"She's not a ha ha ha type . . . I like that she's tall.\"</p> <p>With the world's fears that the White House might soon be home to a diminutive ha ha ha type thus allayed, the article moves on to the more important topic of Banks' qualities. Her chatshow is apparently a kind of televisual answer to the Samaritans, dissuading would-be jumpers from the ledge or the gin bottle and the fistful of sleeping pills. \"I had a woman come up to me when I was seeing Rent once. She told me she was going to commit suicide until she saw [Banks'] show. I held her hand and cried with her in the aisle.\" The pressing question of how many of their fellow patrons found their enjoyment of the musical irrevocably marred by a former supermodel and a complete stranger drowning out the quieter passages with their sobbing goes unasked, perhaps because this kind of thing seems to be an everyday occurrence: \"I get that kind of stuff; it doesn't stop.\" </p> <p>But whatever you think of Banks by the time you've finished the article -- and it seems likely you'll think she's a bit crackers -- you have to say that it and the accompanying photos cast a harsh light on British political reporting, with its grey comment pieces and sketches and leaders. Should you doubt such reasoning, consider this. </p> <p>How much more appealing would the current foreign secretary seem as a prospective PM if he'd posed his threat to Gordon Brown's leadership not with a lengthy article calling for a commitment to a bolder policy agenda, but by inveigling a top homegrown model -- let's say Lucy Pinder, sometime Nuts magazine columnist and owner, according to the Daily Star, of \"the best natural pair in Britain\" -- to (a) pose for a series of photographs in a mock-up of No 10 with a David Miliband lookalike and (b) give an accompanying interview personally vouching that Mrs Miliband is not a ha ha ha type? </p> <p>The case rests.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-336340023\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>The most lavish Olympic games of the modern era will get under way today in the spectacular Bird's Nest stadium, with more than 80 heads of state joining 91,000 spectators and 15,000 performers for an opening ceremony expected to attract a global television audience of more than 3bn people.</p> <p>Despite concerns over pollution, security and human rights, the organisers are promising a 16-day extravaganza of sport; their spokesman, Sun Weide, said: \"Of course, we hope that these will be a great games, even the greatest.\"</p> <p>It will certainly start with a bang as 35,000 fireworks illuminate the five-hour ceremony. The identity of the athlete who will light the torch has not been announced and the method that will be used to elevate the Olympic flame from the track to the cauldron suspended 350 feet above on the roof of the stadium remains shrouded in secrecy. </p> <p>Billions of dollars and seven years of planning have gone into preparing the city for these games, and last night the sense of expectation was palpable. The boundaries of the Olympic Green, the main sports thoroughfare, were thronged with sightseers drawn to the spectacular illuminations of the stadium and the Water Cube aquatic centre, pulsing a deep blue as night fell.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the organisers will be hoping for a change in the weather to disperse the smog that tends to hang over the national stadium. Beijing's air pollution index yesterday was recorded at 96 , which came close to exceeding the national level for acceptable air. Today's forecast is for overcast skies with a slight chance of showers in the afternoon; greater relief may come at the weekend, with a forecast of moderate rain that could help wash out pollutants.</p> <p>Another cloud on the horizon is the issue of drugs. Although there have been no positive tests out of more than 600 carried out in the past two weeks, John Fahey, the president of the World Anti-Doping Agency, warned yesterday that sport could not risk another big drugs scandal. \"If we don't [tackle doping], part of the world will leave us because the public will desert any sport, any time, if they are not satisfied it has integrity,\" he said.</p> <p>The significance of this moment for China and its relations with the rest of the world is clear from the most high-profile guestlist the Olympic movement has ever seen. For the Beijing regime, the opening ceremony is a political event as important as the sporting spectacular, and yesterday the country's president, Hu Jintao, held audiences with a dozen state leaders and royal family members. George Bush heads a list that includes the Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin, Afghanistan's president, Hamid Karzai, Israel's president, Shimon Peres, and his French counterpart, Nicolas Sarkozy.</p> <p>Of the main developed nations, only Britain and Germany are not represented by their most senior politician, though Gordon Brown will attend the closing ceremony. His predecessor, Tony Blair, will be there, however, as will the Olympics minister, Tessa Jowell, and sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe. </p> <p>London's mayor, Boris Johnson, is staying away until the end of the games when he will receive the Olympic flag from the International Olympic Committee president, Jacques Rogge. Ken Livingstone, the man he beat in June's election, is in Beijing as a guest of the city authorities.</p> <p>Those in attendance will witness an athletes' parade that has been touched by politics and will reflect the diplomatic tensions between the US and China that surfaced this week. A day after China revoked the visa of the 2002 speed-skating gold medallist Joey Cheek for fear that he would speak out against Beijing's support for the Sudanese regime accused of sponsoring genocide in Darfur, the US team announced that Lopez Lomong, a refugee from Sudan, would carry the stars and stripes at the head of the team.</p> <p>Rogge also announced yesterday that the North and South Korean teams will not be marching together as they did in Athens and Sydney. Instead, they will march in one after the other, with North Korea coming first, courtesy of the Mandarin alphabet used to decide the order. </p> <p>Rogge said he was convinced the games would be a positive step for China and its engagement with the rest of the world. \"The excitement I feel and the IOC feels is that of an athlete before a major competition,\" he said.</p> <p>\"As for the significance of these games, each games is important for the Olympic movement, and each has its own identity. Clearly in Greece the games was going back to its roots, to its birthplace in the home of classicism. China will be opening up the games to one fifth of mankind, and the next games in London will be in the country that invented modern sport and gave athleticism to the world.</p> <p>\"I think this will mean a lot for the perception of China. On the one hand for the rest of the world to discover China will be to discover a country that is for most of the world a bit mysterious. But they will find a country with 5,000 years of history, a fascinating country. I believe the spotlight on China will help the world to understand China, and it will also help China to understand the world.\"</p>",
  "<p>When Che Guevara decided to export Cuba's revolution to South America he chose Bolivia, a country where poverty and inequality were so extreme that the oppressed would surely rally to his banner. He was wrong. The rebellion flopped and the guerrilla was captured and executed in 1967. </p> <p>Four decades later the eastern lowlands of Alto Parapeti, where Guevara plotted his doomed campaign, have not changed much. The lush landscape of corn and cattle is still owned by a handful of rich landowners and the rickety huts that house their labourers are still occupied by impoverished indigenous families.</p> <p>\"All my life I've been here and at the end of it I have nothing and have nowhere else to go,\" said Teresa Barrio, 65, a half-blind grandmother. She had lost five of seven children to disease and had no pesos in the pockets of her ragged skirt.</p> <p>\"It is a land lost to God,\" said one United Nations official, who requested anonymity because of political sensitivity. </p> <p>But now there is supposed to be a new revolution sweeping Bolivia. Evo Morales, the Andean nation's first indigenous president, took power three years ago promising radical but peaceful socialist policies to finish what his hero Guevara had barely started.</p> <p>This weekend the new revolution faces a crucial test when Bolivians vote in a recall referendum on whether to confirm or eject the president and elected regional governors. If Morales loses he must resign and call an election. If he wins he will claim a fresh mandate to \"refound\" South America's poorest country.</p> <p>Morales's ambitious project is struggling. The plight of Barrio and other Guarani Indians in Alto Parapeti shows just how little has changed for the peasants who support him. </p> <p>Many are illiterate and have little or no access to healthcare, electricity or running water. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, part of the pan-regional Organisation of American States (OAS), said in June that the conditions were akin to slavery. \"They live in extreme poverty and are subjected to punishments including lashings.\" </p> <p>Despite the historic landslide in his 2005 election Morales has struggled to deliver change. Like Guevara, he has made some tactical blunders, polarised the country and encountered fierce resistance.</p> <p>The relatively prosperous eastern lowlands have rebuffed land reform and other government policies, saying they are ruinous and autocratic. Landowners have blocked government inspection teams, sometimes violently. Four departments recently voted for autonomy in unofficial referendums, a bold challenge to the central government based in La Paz.</p> <p>This week protesters besieged an airport and clashed with police, leaving two dead and forcing Morales to call off a summit with the presidents of Venezuela and Argentina, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Cristina Kirchner.</p> <p>Security concerns obliged Morales to hold Wednesday's independence day celebrations in his power base of La Paz rather than the opposition-run city of Sucre, underlining that much of the country has become unsafe for him.</p> <p>The president accused \"small and privileged groups\" of blocking change. \"These groups do not want equality ... They do not respect the identity and diversity of our people.\" </p> <p>The head of OAS, Jos\u00e9 Miguel Insulza, said he was \"deeply concerned\" about the political violence and appealed to all sides to allow Sunday's referendum to go ahead peacefully.</p> <p>With the country so polarised the centrepiece of Morale's agenda, a new constitution, has stalled. Sunday's recall referendum is his high-stakes effort to regain momentum. </p> <p>The coca farmer-turned president is expected to survive since to eject him opponents must garner more votes than he won in 2005 when he gained 53.7%. Opinion polls suggest his popularity has only dipped slightly. </p> <p>A huge sign in El Alto - Bolivia's de facto indigenous capital - captured the mood of his supporters: \"Evo as you never abandoned the people, the people will never abandon you. Vote yes\".</p> <p>If several opposition governors are ousted the president could revive his push for a new constitution. \"This referendum is going to clearly show the support for President Evo Morales,\" said Alfredo Rada, the minister for government. \"The ratification of his mandate will set on stone the fact that Bolivia is on the right track, that it is undergoing a transformation.\" </p> <p>In fact even if Morales wins the deadlock is likely to continue since the most important opposition governors, their confidence boosted by the recent autonomy votes, are tipped to hold on to their jobs. </p> <p>\"If [the president] is not revoked on Sunday he should respect our will of autonomy, and we will then try to respect his authority,\" said Carlos Dabdoud, an opposition leader in Santa Cruz province.</p> <p>By championing indigenous rights over those of mixed-race heritage Morales had forfeited the support of half the country, he said. \"We cannot back this so-called process of change as this is not a change for all Bolivians.\"</p> <p>Analysts express alarm that the polarisation had paralysed the political process and corrupted institutions, with civil servants, the courts, the police and army sucked into taking sides.</p> <p>With little prospect of compromise, or either side scoring a knockout victory, many government supporters are digging in for a long battle of attrition, a far cry from the heady early days when Morales spoke of overturning 500 years of colonialism.</p> <p>\"We have to back this government because it is defending the rights of the indigenous peoples ... but it has been acting very slowly,\" said Jos\u00e9 Amangay, a Guarani leader.</p>",
  "<p>Most of us would agree that the world is full of fascinating people; unlike most of us, however, the film-maker Jonathan Demme seems to be compelled to make documentaries about them, all at the same time. As a result, the atmosphere in his New York apartment is one of low-level hysteria, as if everyone present has been drinking too much coffee. At an all-day production meeting that is just dispersing, the 64-year-old director and his collaborators have been discussing a new film about Bob Marley; there's also a Neil Young movie in the works - Demme's second - as well as a project following families made homeless by Hurricane Katrina. Then there are the short works he's been posting on YouTube and, finally, the movie we're meeting to discuss, Jimmy Carter: Man from Plains, about the post-presidential adventures of Jimmy Carter. </p> <p>Documentaries have always been a part of Demme's output, but these days the director of big-budget fictions such as The Silence of the Lambs and Philadelphia seems intoxicated by fact. \"I can sometimes fall victim to my own enthusiasm,\" he concedes. \"Especially now, with all the new technology, because even I can shoot the camera. I'm always ready to jump up and say, 'Let's film that!'\" He rubs his eyes and blinks, a little sheepishly. \"Filming stuff is great,\" he says, as if it were a recent discovery.</p> <p>The 39th president of the United States might not sound like the most promising of subjects. He's a hero to many for the humanitarian work he's done since leaving office in 1981, but not necessarily a very interesting hero. To some on the American right, he's a scold and a has-been, whose ultra-liberal views are best ignored. But in Demme's film, which follows Carter on the 2006 publicity tour for his controversial book Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid, he emerges as a compelling character - stubborn yet compassionate, unfazed by vicious criticism, yet ready to burst into tears as soon as he recalls his Georgia childhood. Pulling his wheeled suitcase behind him - Carter won't let anyone else touch it - the 83-year-old ex-president tirelessly criss-crosses the country on commercial flights, signing books in stores, giving TV and radio interviews and responding to mounting hostility, most of the time with implacable patience. </p> <p>Demme says he thinks of the film as a western. \"The more I thought about Carter, the more I started thinking about High Noon,\" he says. \"The idea of the ageing peacemaker who should be in retirement, having once again to strap on his guns - in Jimmy Carter's case, he's strapping on his heart and soul - and coming forth into town, one last time, to confront his adversaries, those who would perpetuate violence. It's Gary Cooper, striding down the street, all alone: no one's stronger than the really old guy who takes on a good mission when he should be allowed to be on the porch in his rocking chair.\"</p> <p>Carter's mission isn't quite as incendiary as his book title suggests. As he tirelessly explains to interviewers who haven't read his book, he uses the word \"apartheid\" to describe the situation in the occupied territories, not in Israel. Primarily, he wants to communicate the fact - little-known in much of America - that the Israeli-built security barrier makes deep incursions into Palestinian territory. And he wants the two sides to talk. But his analogy with South Africa provokes a parade of critics, from a coalition of Arizona rabbis to the high-profile Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz, who accuse him of antisemitism, plagiarism, senility and more.</p> <p>Demme received his earliest cinematic education from the exploitation director Roger Corman - Demme's first movie was Caged Heat, an instance of the lurid \"women in prison\" genre - and credits Corman with first teaching him that a film should never grow too enamoured of its hero. \"One of the very first things Corman tells you, as a new director, is that you've got to make sure your adversary is every bit as strong and interesting as your protagonist,\" he says. \"So when we were filming at the Carter Centre in Atlanta, and the consul from Israel was identified as being in the audience, I was, like, 'Oh my God, I've got to get him.' I was desperate for points of view in opposition. I chased him across the grounds of the Carter Centre, and in the end I was lucky enough to have this very attractive guy, giving a very heartfelt, non-didactic comment.\" </p> <p>Even Dershowitz, whose initial media attacks on Carter bordered on the rabid, comes across as eminently reasonable, scrupulously fact-checking his broadsides before unleashing them. \"He was a tremendously important figure to have in there,\" Demme says. \"As a person of his generation, I felt his pain. I grew up with the emerging documentation of the Holocaust; I'm not Jewish, yet I know the profound impact that had on me. So if you're a Jewish-American of that generation ... I get Dershowitz's pain, and his rage.\"</p> <p>Man from Plains may also be the most candid portrayal ever of the personal and emotional life of a former president. We get to see Carter off-duty at local cook-outs in Plains, the small Georgia town where he was born, and cycling slightly goofily down its main street with his wife, Rosalynn; he explains how they read the Bible to each other at night - on the phone, if necessary - before going to sleep. (\"Shocking intimacy!\" says Demme.) Carter's encounters with strangers seem intimate, too: fans at book signings gaze at him with uncensored affection; TV makeup artists flirt openly. Even the film's only foray into archive footage, an account of the brokering of the Camp David accords, is memorable less for the grand historical events it records than for the images of a sleepy but determined Carter, shuttling back and forth through the night between Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat's cabins in the Maryland countryside. </p> <p>\"In America, you almost want to apologise for being a Jimmy Carter fan,\" says Demme, \"but I don't apologise. Surely now, in the run-up to this particular election, Jimmy Carter must be seen as the great president.\" Carter's term is probably best remembered for the drawn-out humiliation of the Iranian hostage crisis, his handling of which has been blamed for fuelling the rise of Islamist extremism - though Carter is at pains to remind interviewers in the film that all the hostages escaped alive, and no Iranians died, either. (Eight US service personnel were killed.) Barack Obama, for several reasons, has been derisively described recently by rightwingers in America as a new Carter. But to Demme, that's a compliment and not necessarily one Obama deserves. The Democratic candidate has promised to open dialogues with the nation's enemies if elected, but on the Middle East Demme argues that he's been subject to \"brainwashing\" by Aipac, the pro-Israel lobby group, and is \"kowtowing to the pro-Israeli lobby position, and showing incredible insensitivity to the Palestinian side. Carter never got brainwashed ... maybe that's why he didn't get a second term.\" (Demme has also said he would like to \"strap George Bush into a chair and make him watch [Man from Plains] again and again and again.\")</p> <p>Demme had made plenty of factual films before - a sequence of movies about the struggle for democracy in Haiti and numerous concert films such as Stop Making Sense, about Talking Heads. Following Carter, though, his control over unfolding events was at an all-time minimum. One of the most dramatic moments that he shot was never screened - an impassioned meeting between Carter and a group of Arizona rabbis furious at his book. \"They hit him with all the strong stuff, and he responded; he didn't persuade anyone, nor was his mind changed, but everybody got to say what they wanted to say, and it ended beautifully, with a prayer circle. One of the rabbis gave a blessing and wept.\" Everyone present agreed to be filmed, but one of the rabbis later threatened legal action if the footage was used. The result is a strange sequence of silences - we hear some of Carter's words, but not those of the people he's responding to, and the rabbis' faces are blurred - that is, in its own way, an eloquent demonstration of how hard it is to talk about the Middle East in America. \"I was devastated,\" Demme says, \"because I'd been banking on that scene. But then I thought, well, this is a documentary, and this is what happened.\"</p> <p>Through cultish material like Melvin and Howard and Something Wild, Demme became at least as well known for fictional films. Later came the box office successes of Philadelphia and The Silence of the Lambs - which became only the third movie in history to win the Oscars for best director, movie, actor, actress and screenplay - and a remake of The Manchurian Candidate, starring Denzel Washington. But large-budget studio fictions \"are probably a thing of the past for me\", he says now. \"I have no interest. I'm a working film-maker, so I don't need that much money to live, and I just can't take the fashioning-of-the-product aspect to all that. I've had my fill of it.\" In fact, he has just made a fictional film - a drama called Rachel Getting Married, starring Anne Hathaway - but he shot it as a documentary, with the cinematographer Declan Quinn. \"We pretended that what the actors were doing was reality, and we responded to it as we would in any documentary,\" Demme says. \"We never did a take-two of any shot; we did the scenes a number of times, but always from a new perspective. The actors loved it, because the more you do a take, the more you're going to drain the spontaneity out of a performance.\"</p> <p>Fate did, in the end, present Demme with a cinematic confrontation in Man from Plains, despite the problem with the rabbis. Brandeis University, which has a strongly pro-Israel student body, refused his offer to speak there. Then, after much media controversy, it changed its mind. \"Shamefully, I was delighted when Brandeis refused him permission to come - because now we have some adversaries,\" Demme recalls. \"And then they decided, no, he could come ... so that gave us our final gunfight! He'll waltz on to this fiercely pro-Israel campus, and confront the students, and his views will be tested to the maximum.\" Carter and the students do have a frank exchange of opinions; nobody ends up looking worse for having agreed to talk. \"And then he jumps in the car to the airport, and he's off to Darfur!\" Demme says. \"Fantastic! It's, like, 'Who was that masked orator?'\"</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong> Jimmy Carter: Man from Plains is released on August 15.</strong></p>",
  "<p>An Israeli officer involved in the close-range shooting of a blindfolded and cuffed Palestinian man has escaped criminal charges and will remain in the army.</p> <p>Battalion commander Omri Borberg, who was accused by the army of \"severe moral failure\", will be reassigned to another post and will face the relatively minor charge of \"unworthy conduct\".</p> <p>Last month Borberg was recorded on video as he held a Palestinian protester, Ashraf Abu-Rahma, by the arm while another soldier fired a rubber bullet into the captured man's foot. The shot bruised his toe.</p> <p>Abu-Rahma had been protesting against Israel's construction of its barrier on Palestinian land in the West Bank village of Ni'ilin, where the confrontations between Israel's military and demonstrators have increasingly become violent.</p> <p>Last week a 10-year-old boy and an 18-year-old man were fatally shot in the head in separate incidents in Ni'ilin.</p> <p>The Israeli human rights groups B'Tselem, Yesh Din, the Association for Civil Rights, and the Public Committee Against Torture attacked the army's disciplining of Borberg as lenient.</p> <p>\"If that officer had been caught smoking hash they would not only have been discharged from the army but they would also spend two or three months in prison,\" said Yesh Din's legal adviser, Michael Sfard.</p> <p> \"The charge of inappropriate conduct is something extremely minor with no criminal record if you are found guilty,\" he added.</p> <p>B'Tselem's spokeswoman, Sarit Michaeli, said: \"The father of the young woman who filmed the incident is still under house arrest. Three days after [B'Tselem] released the video the father was arrested at a protest. He is charged with various offences; they're not as severe [as the charge against Borberg] but he has been remanded in custody.\"</p> <p>The soldier who shot Abu-Rahma in the foot, and who was under Borberg's command, also faces military charges. He alleges that he fired the bullet after Borberg said: \"Shoot a rubber bullet at him.\"</p> <p>Together, the four human rights organisations are to mount a case in Israel's high court to intervene in secretive military court procedures in an attempt to charge Borberg with a criminal offence.</p> <p>Borberg said he had resigned from his post \"for the good of the soldier, the battalion and the army\", but Israel's military spokesman would not confirm whether the resignation was voluntary. \"I see myself serving for many more years at the heart of military activity,\" Borberg said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Israel's defence minister, Ehud Barak, ordered military forces to demolish the home of Ala Abu Dhaim, the East Jerusalem Palestinian who gunned down eight students in the Merkaz Harav yeshiva in March. It marks a return to the policy of using demolitions in retaliation for terrorist attacks, which was abandoned in 2005 after it was deemed ineffective.</p> <p>The homes of the two Palestinians, who in separate incidents rammed Israeli civilians with bulldozers, killing three and injuring dozens more, are also due to be destroyed. </p> <p>Jerusalem's mayor, Uri Lupolianski, said: \"The demolition will serve as a clear message that the families of every terrorist who goes out to attack and murder Israelis will also be harmed.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Democrats' acrimonious primary battle came back to haunt Hillary Clinton yesterday, a day before she sets off on her first solo campaign swing for Barack Obama, with John McCain using footage of her attacking the Democratic candidate in a new campaign ad.</p> <p>The ad, which was released on the internet, features a number of Democratic leaders - including Obama - offering praise for McCain. But only Clinton, who is the closing speaker, goes so far as to take a jab at Obama, in footage culled from one of her primary rallies.</p> <p>The ad surfaced a day before Clinton is to step in as Obama's chief cheerleader with a campaign appearance in Nevada today. She is to travel to the pivotal state of Florida next week.</p> <p>The appearances are intended to keep up the momentum while Obama is on holiday in Hawaii.</p> <p>In the new ad released by the Republicans, Clinton is shown saying: \"I know Senator McCain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the White House and Senator Obama has a speech that he gave in 2002.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uSpcxkKlEFA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <object width=\"460\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/uSpcxkKlEFA&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/uSpcxkKlEFA&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"460\" height=\"385\"></embed></object> </figure>   <p>The damaging footage is the realisation of Democratic fears at the height of the contest that Clinton's no-holds-barred attacks on Obama, with repeated questioning of his experience and readiness to serve in the White House, would provide ammunition to the Republicans during the presidential contest.</p> <p>A spokesman for the McCain campaign said yesterday: \"Hillary Clinton was making a strong and valid argument for why John McCain will be the next president.\"</p> <p>\"In this case, we couldn't have said it better ourselves,\" Tucker Bounds said in an email to the Guardian. Bounds said the ad would not be released on television, allowing the McCain campaign to capitalise on Clinton's now embarrassing comments at relatively little expense.</p> <p>Aside from the immediate damage, the ad revives questions about Clinton's commitment to unifying the party behind Obama - despite her repeated appeals to her loyalists to come on board. </p> <p>Some of those loyalists said this week that they had no intention of backing Obama, and are planning to hold a protest march through Denver on the day Clinton is scheduled to address the Democratic convention.</p> <p>\"We are 18 million voices dedicated to seeing Senator Clinton reach the next milestone: the White House,\" says one of the loyalist websites.</p> <p>Clinton has kept a low profile since a highly orchestrated unity rally with Obama in June. But she has been working behind the scenes to persuade her loyalists to come on board, and this week issued a joint statement with Obama promising \"all voices\" would be heard at the convention. </p> <p>\"At the Democratic convention, we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the November election,\" the statement said.</p> <p>Clinton told a fundraiser in California last week that she wanted the convention to be a \"cathartic\" experience for her supporters. She said it was hard for some of her diehard supporters to acknowledge defeat.</p> <p>\"I mean everybody comes, and they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity, and I think that's all to the good, because then, you know, everybody can go, 'OK great. Now let's go out and win,'\" she said, on YouTube footage.</p> <p>\"The best way I think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like they've had a role and that their legitimacy has been validated and that kind of ... you know, there is a catharsis,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>The news of the potential impeachment of President Pervez Musharraf means further political instability for Pakistan - at least in the short term.</p> <p>Though a deal has finally been done between the Pakistan People's party (PPP), effectively led by the late Benazir Bhutto's husband, Asif Zardari, and Nawaz Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League-N (PML-N), this indicates a very temporary coincidence of interest rather than a new solidarity. However, the beleaguered president's decision not to go to China for the opening ceremony of the Olympic games shows he is taking the threat seriously.</p> <p>No Pakistani president has ever been impeached and the procedure laid down in the 1973 constitution is likely to mean a classic drawn-out Pakistani politico-legal wrangle. Impeachment is a political process relying on a two-thirds majority of both houses of parliament deciding to remove the president from office on the grounds of gross misconduct, physical or mental impairment or violation of the constitution. Musharraf's declaration of a state of emergency last November, shortly after getting himself re-elected for a second five-year term, means the third option is the most likely.</p> <p>But the PPP and the PML-N will need help from smaller groupings - including hardline religious elements and a significant number of the 17 independent parliamentarians - to get the impeachment through the national assembly. Such support is uncertain at best and all assembly members, particularly the independents, are likely to be the subject of frantic horse-trading. </p> <p>Equally, Musharraf still has powerful and wealthy allies such as the loyalists of the Pakistan Muslim League-Q; and an impeachment could also prove to be unpopular at home and overseas. </p> <p>The issues of the restoration of about 60 judges removed from their posts by Musharraf when he declared the emergency last year is directly linked to the impeachment. \"They have to be restored otherwise the case that the president has acted unconstitutionally is not convincing,\" said Professor Osama Siddique, an expert in constitutional law in Pakistan.</p> <p>A simpler way of ousting Musharraf may simply be to use the threat of the impeachment to force him to opt for a confidence vote. However, given that he is unlikely to win, the president will resist such a move if he can.</p> <p>The west will be watching the evolving relations between the military and Pakistan's political leaders closely. A recent attempt to subject the country's powerful Inter Services Intelligence service (ISI) to civilian authority backfired badly. Even though Musharraf still has some friends within the sprawling military establishment, few analysts believe the army will intervene.</p> <p>The real winner may eventually be Sharif, a two-time former prime minister who returned to Pakistan from exile in Saudi Arabia last year. His PML-N party did well in the spring elections, especially in the key province of the Punjab. He has the vote of much of the religiously conservative, patriotic commercial middle class in Pakistan's rapidly growing cities and has his finger on the popular pulse more than any other politician. And it is Sharif, who detests the president, who has pushed hard for impeachment.</p> <p>Musharraf still has the theoretical constitutional right to dissolve parliament - subject to eventual supreme court approval. This is the political \"smart bomb\" that the president could use to delay his impeachment - but only at the cost of provoking a new election and giving Sharif, whom he ousted in 1999, the chance to consolidate his power. Whatever the result of this latest crisis, it is Sharif who is likely to come out on top.</p>",
  "<p>The latest Batman film, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/\">The Dark Knight</a>, continues to break records, taking just 18 days to make <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7544574.stm\">more than $400 million</a>. Its popularity is part of the reinvention of the modern \"realistic\" superhero \u2013 a combination of celebrity twinned with powerful abilities and ultimately a flawed humanity. Yet the ability of celebrity to elevate a person's profile combined with an almost religious devotion to hero worship is a dangerous combination when it comes to choosing the next president of the United States.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.thersa.org/events/audio-and-past-events/democracy-participation-to-passivity---can-things-change\">panel discussion</a> about political participation at the RSA recently, commentator <a href=\"http://www.thersa.org/events/speakers-archive/richard-reeves\">Richard Reeves</a> spoke about how everyone overestimates the power of individual action and underestimates the power of collective action. </p> <p>Nowhere is the idea of individual action more pronounced than in a superhero saving the world, especially a world more interconnected by issues than ever before. Barack Obama <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/07/24/obama-in-berlin-video-of_n_114771.html\">outlined these ideas</a> in Berlin saying that \"now is the time to join together, through constant cooperation, strong institutions, shared sacrifice, and a global commitment to progress, to meet the challenges of the 21st century\".</p> <p>Indeed, Obama is emerging as a 21st century political hero, if not quite yet across America certainly across the world. Rolling Stone magazine described him as \"the new hope\", and his profile is such that the McCain team decided to attack it as shallow celebrity over <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo0ItAXn-Ew&amp;feature=related\">genuine leadership credentials</a>. Attacks on him will mean that Obama, like Batman, will always have to wear a mask to separate the junior senator from Illinois from the ideals he represents which are far greater. It also means that if he is a true political hero he will have to sacrifice himself to the responsibilities of leadership. While Spiderman's uncle warned him that \"with great power comes great responsibility\", the current Bush administration is characterised by an avoidance of responsibility in a never-ending battle to manipulate the reality of its failure in Iraq. </p> <p>But for those suffering from Obama-mania there is a clear danger of disappointment. Beneath the slogan of \"change you can believe in\" is just a political appointment, albeit the most powerful one in the world, but still one surrounded by the checks and balances of America's constitutional democracy. Can Obama <a href=\"http://www.barackobama.com/issues/\">turn around</a> the American economy, bring health care to all and help 37 million Americans out of poverty just as Superman can stop an asteroid or Batman a psychopathic villain? </p> <p>What about beyond America's borders, where the checks and balances are equally restrictive? Obama, like Gordon Brown before him, is focusing a foreign policy agenda on Afghanistan simply because it is seen as a \"good war\" in contrast to the \"bad war\" in Iraq, ignoring the historical legacy of any major power trying to impose its will on the country. Obama has also placed emphasis on securing the Pakistan\u2013Afghanistan border as a means to strangle the supply lines and strategic depth of the Taliban. Yet as sound as such geopolitical rhetoric appears, the continued inability of the US to secure its own border with Mexico despite massive investment in manpower and surveillance technologies means that securing one of the world's most porous borders will be beyond him. </p> <p>The Bush years were a testimony to overestimating the limits of US power. Democracy and freedom are not reigning in the Middle East. The mighty Nato couldn't find Karadzic for years because he'd grown a beard. The mightier Americans have failed to locate Bin Laden and Mullah Omar, perhaps because they both had beards before the search began. The bottom line is that the superpower does not possess super powers.</p> <p>So what of Batman's voting choice? Reginald Hunter recently <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFFDdgRj3nE\">described</a> the caped crusader as a \"conservatives' wet dream\" \u2013 and certainly the scene where he uses extraordinary rendition in Hong Kong would identify him with the present Republican administration. In reality, however, Batman would be torn between the conventional war hero in McCain, and what Caroline Presno <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/caroline-presno/could-obama-be-the-next-p_b_101572.html\">described</a> as a postmodern hero in Obama. Most likely he will reserve judgment of either man until one or other is in power. As Batman once said: \"It is not who I am underneath, but what I do that defines me.\"</p>",
  "<p>For years it has been a joke that news in the United States is terrible: obsessed with trivia and celebrity; fronted by Botox bimbos; forever interviewing citizens about some artefact of small-town life when a major news story is breaking elsewhere.</p> <p>Well, the truth is that it's far, far worse than that. There are a multitude of news channels - CNN, MSNBC, CBS, NBC, PBS, Fox. But after an hour of flipping between them during lunchtime last week, this was the sum total of information gleaned: there are two US presidential candidates; they have produced campaign ads; people have made video parodies and posted them on the internet; a US TV news host appeared on a US TV chatshow last night; and someone said something controversial (read ignorant) on a different TV show the day before.</p> <p>In the meantime, one of the most sought-after war criminals in the world had been arrested and sent for trial; several new scientific breakthroughs had been announced; Zimbabwe edged carefully toward shared government; the Indian government dealt with votes of no-confidence and terrorist attacks; and countless other real stories came and went. For millions of Americans, these events appeared as 15-word tickertapes at the bottom of their 36-inch widescreen TVs.</p> <p>It's not the absolute dearth of real news that is the problem, however. It's the fact that the news that <em>is</em> presented isn't news but mindless, misleading gossip. The clearest example of this is when one of the (between two and six) commentators on any given story provides their \"analysis\".</p> <p>This comprises of showing a video clip and then talking with the assumed voice of the person in the clip. So, for example, Barack Obama gave a press conference. A clip of around four or five seconds of what he said is shown and then the TV studio people take over.</p> <p>News anchor: \"So what he's saying is 'Hey, I'm the guy in charge here - I'm the person who decides what to do, not you.' Is that right?\"</p> <p>Commentator: \"I think what he was saying was: 'If I become president, then I'll be the person that calls the shots.'\"</p> <p>Commentator Two: \"I don't agree. He's saying: 'I am going to listen to others \u2013 that's what I'll do \u2013 but make no mistake I'll be the person who makes the final decision.'\"</p> <p>This goes on and on with people making up dialogue and pretending to be Obama (or John McCain or anyone else that comes to mind) rather than broadcasting what was actually said. </p> <p>But it gets worse:</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Unfair comment:</strong> The analysis of what someone has said is clearly bent by the reporters themselves along ideological lines. Unrelated facts and events are attached and then attacked, and the original news point ends up as little more than a launching pad for the experts' own political perspectives. So a sober report on, say, house prices ends up as a criticism of the Republican party's fiscal policy (without any details of that policy being provided). In the worst cases, something with no news value at all is introduced in order to score political points \u2013 such as McCain eating at a German restaurant, or Obama knocking fists with his wife. </p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Tail-chasing and navel gazing:</strong> The <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBRUalssp0Q\">media reports constantly on itself</a>. And that really does mean constantly. Anything reported on the TV news instantly becomes something to be reported on. For an entire day the lead on most TV networks was whether the media was giving Obama too much coverage. The second day comprised of whether the coverage given to Obama was too uncritical. By the third day, much of the coverage was about the previous two days' coverage, complete with clips of how rival networks were covering the \"news\". News hosts also regularly appear on other news hosts' shows, and then feature that appearance on their own show.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Never let the story get in the way:</strong> The focus is entirely on the back story, and the actual news is given lip-service. So you'll hear more about how a decision was arrived at than what the actual decision was, or what impact it might have. The idea is that you are getting the real juice. The reality is you are forced to drink a pint of conjecture concentrate. Presidential campaign ads have become lead stories. A one-second image flash of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHXYsw_ZDXg\">Britney Spears and Paris Hilton in a recent ad</a> implied that Obama was no more than a celebrity. It led to hours of primetime news speculation, while the ad's central claim that Obama would raise taxes if elected was ignored.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The Jerry Springer school of journalism:</strong> There is never a neutral statement - it is always an <a href=\"http://elections.foxnews.com/\">extreme perspective</a>. If you are the news anchor, you can speak in a third-party voice and add a question mark on the end to suggest impartiality. But otherwise, wild claims are balanced with an equally wild claim at the other end. If someone attempts to point out logical inconsistencies, they are almost always faced with personal mockery by the other commentators. Just one example of this bizarre, school-bully behaviour: When one commentator, speaking from Las Vegas, tried to point out why an offshore drilling bill (which had been misrepresented as a reason why the Democrats were responsible for high petrol prices), had not been passed by Congress, he was told by the anchor that he had clearly spent too much time at the craps tables. He was told soon after by another commentator he had spent too much time at the bar. The substance of his argument did not of course merit discussion. </p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The gold(fish) rush:</strong> There is absolutely no effort to provide historical context. The news is paced so frenetically that anything beyond soundbites is not tolerated. News anchors consistently talk over the top of anyone that doesn't provide a punchy point every 10 seconds. Swooshing graphics and dance music add to the general level of pace \u2013 which effectively masks the fact that almost nothing is being provided beyond personal opinion. </p> <p>\u2022 <strong>When did you stop beating your wife?</strong> Coverage is deeply cynical in the sense that people are assumed to have a hidden and planned agenda even when the connection drawn would have been impossible to predict as it doesn't follow logical reasoning. Speculation with no foundation in logic or fact is opened up as a serious news item with the simple inclusion of the phrase \"Did [insert name of person] know about [insert event]?\" The answer \u2013 if there was ever any attempt to actually arrive at it \u2013 will always be \"No\".</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Fight! Fight! Fight!</strong> There is no effort to reach a greater understanding. Instead, the sole intent is to provoke disagreement and partisan perspective - with the anchor used solely to egg on disagreement. Nearly every segment ends with the anchor shutting off argument and promoting the idea that they will have to agree to disagree.</p> <p>So where do you get your news while living in the US? News-starved Americans usually hold up National Public Radio, NPR, as the best option. But with interlude music fresh from the 1920s and a twee, kitchen-table-chat approach, this is news wrapped in a tea cosy.</p> <p>Two comedy programmes, the <a href=\"http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=178314&amp;title=the-race-genie&amp;byDate=true\">Daily Show</a> and the Colbert Report, fill a peculiar niche of serious analysis with gags and are possibly the main news source for people under 30. They both viciously lampoon the news media, which pretends not to notice and runs clips from them on their own shows.<br>There is hope however. The non-news cycle is increasingly being broken by the internet. Thanks to cheap digital technology and fast net connections, online video is a simple prospect and means it is possible to get your fix of moving images with real news thrown in.</p> <p>Not that TV news is concerned. The internet, and YouTube in particular, is a network's dream: an Aladdin's Cave of uninformed, one-sided and aggressive gossip and commentary, all of it searchable and requiring minimal expenditure of time or money. And so every day you can find news anchors running short clips of the very best the internet can offer before turning to the experts to give their views.</p>",
  "<p>Hang on there. Did I misjudge Paris Hilton? John McCain has been using Hilton and Britney Spears in an attack ad designed to suggest that Barack Obama is also, like, a global celebrity airhead, someone who attracts a crowd of 200,000 foreigners in Germany \u2013 twice what's he's managed at home \u2013 and has become both arrogant and presumptuous as a result of his premature fame.</p> <p>So far, so predictable. I ignore all controversy involving Hilton, so I ignored this one too. I did last night in a bar where it was showing on TV with the sound turned down - always instructive. But no. Hilton's counterattack is in the papers and on high IQ radio. I've just checked it out on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSJCnBz7cTg\">YouTube</a> and it's both smart and funny. It mocks McCain, who had it coming to him, but it also laughs at Paris Hilton. On her lounger in a leopard print swimsuit she shows self-awareness of the kind which has always eluded bluestockings like Germaine Greer and Richard Dawkins.</p> <p>\"Hey America, I'm Paris Hilton and I'm a celebrity too. Only I'm not from the olden days and I'm not promising change like that other guy. I'm just hot!\" she says in a script written for her by Chris Henchy, Brooke Shields' husband. </p> <p>But were Henchy (44) and Hilton (27) right to mock McCain (almost 72) for being a \"wrinkly white-haired dude\", so old he can remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in buckets? My instinct is yes, partly because the McCain camp started it and partly \u2013 see above \u2013 because Paris is also funny about herself. Before explaining her energy policy, she dips into Conde Nast Traveler looking for the best place to get a tan.</p> <p>The energy policy isn't daft at all: take McCain's commitment to drill for oil off the US coastal shelf (under strict environmental controls) and Obama's demand for alternative energy sources, and do a bit of both. Give Detroit tax incentives to make better hybrid and electric cars, she says. \"Energy crisis solved, I'll see you at the debates, bitches!\"</p> <p>The crucial point is that viewers will probably join in the joke. That's important: jokes work. Tony Blair defused Cherie's waspish aside about Gordon Brown by telling Labour conference: \"At least I know she won't run off with the bloke next door.\" Much more relevant here is Ronald Reagan's <a href=\"http://www-cgi.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/debates/history/1984/\">ambush</a> of Walter Mondale in the second of the 1984 presidential debates. Mondale had knocked Reagan about a bit in the first, making him look tired and out of touch. In round two the wily president was waiting for his moment. When it came, Reagan said \"I am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent's youth and inexperience.\" Not a great gag, but everyone laughed. I was there and felt Reagan won re-election in that moment.</p> <p>A friend I chatted with at a wedding in Washington, who is desperate for the Democrat to win, almost whispered \"Does Obama have a sense of humour?\" It's a good question, and others share that fear. A sense of humour matters. McCain is not only old and notoriously bad-tempered, he's also said by people who know to be mean-spirited and capable of abandoning his more attractive and independent positions ( even on torture!) to ingratiate himself with the suspicious Republican mainstream. But he can be funny. When a reporter suggested that \"voters may reject you because they feel you're too old to be president\", McCain didn't move for a second or two. He was pretending to be asleep.</p> <p>You can imagine Vince Cable doing that, but not Ming Campbell, who is only a touch older but thinks older. Blair might pull it off, probably not Gordon Brown. David Cameron has a sense of humour. It's no guarantee \u2013 Mrs Thatcher was never accused of having one \u2013 but it helps.</p> <p>The McCain attack ads, and those freelance ones not authorised by him, are nastier than European voters probably realise, insulated as they are from paid political adverts (a great European achievement, incidentally). In 1988, Bush senior used racist crime ads to diminish that turkey of a Democrat, Mike Dukakis.</p> <p>But there's often a germ of truth in such viciousness. McCain's attack dogs want to paint Obama as an exotic: almost-foreign, liberal and elitist. That <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/covers/slideshow_blittcovers\">New Yorker cover</a>, intended to caricature that view of the Democratic candidate and his wife, helped McCain, I feel sure. </p> <p>Trouble is there's something there, a kind of distance from the electorate in the highly-efficient Obama campaign which American friends - mostly Democrats - confirm. I don't think he's got the election in the bag, as much liberal commentary around the world assumes. Middle America is a very cautious and conservative place. Even in states like Massachusetts, white working class Americans are not sure what to do. It isn't just the race thing, either. With 97 days to go, you can take comfort if you seek it from <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/08/05/obama-calls-mccain-out-af_n_117142.html\">Obama's response</a> to McCain's jibe that the Democrat's answer to the fuel crisis is that American drivers should keep their tyre pressure up and save gas. It's good advice, of course, but McCain mocked it. \"It's like these guys are proud of being ignorant,\" Obama told his own crowds. </p> <p>But George Bush is said to have quoted Abraham Lincoln's maxim about being able \"to fool some of the people all of the time\" - adding \"they're they ones we have to concentrate on.\" A good joke - though scary. Don't push your luck and post another ad, Paris, there's too much riding on this election. You may not get it right next time.</p>",
  "<p>I'm five months pregnant, and I'm obsessed with money. Lest you think I'm some kind of \u00fcber-confident gold digger or super materialist, let me assure you that I'm neither. I'm just a middle-class professional woman who's scared to turn on the news many days because I know the financials will be terrifying. And I know I'm not alone.</p> <p>This election, I will vote for the candidate who speaks realistically about our country's financial future. Sorry, John McCain: I care less about winning the war in Iraq than I care about paying for it. I feel a secure financial future for the US (currently in a <a href=\"http://www.pgpf.org/\">$53 trillion financial hole</a>) is ultimately more important - call me unpatriotic. I want to know how we're going to pay for things in this country and how my country will help me have a better life too.</p> <p>For American women now, money is the ultimate women's issue. Not choice. </p> <p>The way Washington, DC non-profit organisations, political campaigns and especially the media package the interests of women voters is a case in micro-inequities, those little acts of discrimination and stereotyping that add up to a lot. It's years of campaigns telling us that single women don't vote much, and when they do, they care only about sexual politics, education and kid issues (in reality, they <a href=\"http://www.alternet.org/election08/89737/what_women_voters_want_in_2008/\">don't even make the top five</a>). It's the incomprehensible recasting of the 2008 Hillary Clinton campaign as being about gender dynamics, when in fact she spent of most of her time talking about the economy. Even the emergence of new post-Hillary PACs like <a href=\"http://www.womencount.org\">www.womencount.org</a>, which launched with a campaign that \"calls on party leaders to 'stop the silence' when examples of sexism occur on the campaign trail\". That's nice, ladies, but I have bigger things to worry about than sexism right now.</p> <p>I'm not about to vote Republican, as <a href=\"http://polifab.blogspot.com/2008/07/unhitched-and-voting.html\">this blogger suggests</a>, and I'm not exhibiting typical \"female marriage gap\" behaviour: voting on kitchen-table issues now that I'm married. As <a href=\"http://www.pollster.com/blogs/margie-omero/\">pollster Margie Omero notes</a>, the marriage gap is not a uniquely female phenomenon \u2013 it's actually larger among men. Margie says: \"For one, it sends a message that women form their political views based on their relationships to others. The 'Soccer Moms' of yesteryear have given way to the 'Carrie' voters of today; we are led to believe the presence or absence of husbands and/or children changes the way women (rather than men) view their worlds.\"</p> <p>That's half true. The presence of my soon-to-be child has altered the way I think about voting, and while that obviously has something to do with my husband, he's not strictly the reason. Doesn't matter if I'm married or single. It's about responsibility. And, like most women, I have plenty of it.</p> <p>Women control 84 cents of every household dollar spent, and we earn about 43% of a two-partner household income. Which makes us anxious. Which means that many of us will vote on the economy in November. But we will vote on <em>our</em> economy - responsible governance and helpful public policy that allows us to do what we want and need to do: work. I feel it's safe to say most women would pay higher taxes for a more effective government. We won't pay to support interest payments on the Iraq war. Women are traditionally more open to an active government, and we believe government can do good, according to a 2004 Women's Voices, Women's Vote poll. </p> <p>Chatting this week, two women I respect a lot, the aforementioned Omero and <a href=\"http://www.digital-sistas.org/home.shtml\">Shireen Mitchell</a>, highlighted the growing prominence of state and local campaigns for issues like pay equity, reasonable childcare, and other public policy instruments that make it possible for women to maintain economic control. Groups like <a href=\"http://MomsRising.org\">MomsRising.org</a> are making change on the state level. On the national level, it's all about gas prices, which are very relevant to most women, but merely a symptom of many other problems.</p> <p>So if the candidates want to win women's votes, they need to address women's economic concerns in a meaningful and consistent way. They need to beat the drum. McCain is doing this very effectively with his use of former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina as a spokesperson. Back from Europe, Obama is starting his campaign to talk to voters on the economy this week. Speaking on energy, he called for a $7,000 tax credit to drivers who buy advanced-technology vehicles and $4bn in direct assistance to Detroit automakers to help them build hybrid vehicles in the US. That sounds right to me: help me make smart economic choices, and I'll help pay for smart government.</p>",

  "<p>African-Americans are <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/page/election-2008-political-pulse-excited-voters\">excited about Barack Obama's success</a> so far. However what they expect of him during this presidential campaign is another matter. It is clear that there are a significant number of people, including those who <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-Se6E4uZhs&amp;feature=related\">heckled him at a town hall meeting last week</a>, who expect an African-American candidate to focus on African-American issues and are disappointed that they have not been placed centre stage in Obama's campaign. </p> <p>The young African-American men who heckled Obama in Florida last week held up a banner that read \"What about the black community, Obama?\" They accused him of not addressing issues specific to African-Americans such as Jena 6, Hurricane Katrina and the killing of Sean Bell. They asked: \"Why is it that you have not had the ability to speak to the interests and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited black community in this country?\"</p> <p>Black British writer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/04/race.usa\">Vanessa Walters expressed dismay</a> that Obama has distanced himself from rapper Ludacris's latest song, which features crude lyrics about Hillary Clinton, John McCain and George Bush. Writing in Comment is Free on Monday, she asserted: \"In the future, [Obama's] got to actually tackle some of the conflicts about being black and excluded.\" </p> <p>Regular Cif commenter <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/10/barackobama.race?commentid=c67d0aba-384f-47e8-80b7-48752b453c1e\">halgeel84</a> takes a great deal of umbrage at what she sees as Obama's lack of interest in black issues. She regularly expresses her concern about what Obama has not, for example, said \"with respect to the challenges black men is facing in America today such as lack of jobs, racial profiling, mass incarceration.\"</p> <p>Such concerns are legitimate. There are indeed serious problems within the African-American community that need to be not only addressed, but solved. It's also natural that African-Americans would hope that Obama, who apparently understands their struggles and challenges and may be about to become part of a system that has oppressed them for so long, would want to effect change on their behalf. </p> <p>However, should African-Americans be managing their expectations? After all, Obama is running for president of the United States, not the NAACP. He is not a civil rights activist. Obama has carefully built up an image as a man for all Americans, carefully treading a fine line when it comes to racial issues and avoiding any attempts to pigeon hole him as \"the black candidate\" whose exclusive concern is African-American issues. </p> <p>It isn't that Obama doesn't care about, or isn't addressing, these issues. He has spoken in front of all-black audiences in churches and town halls, recently addressed the NAACP Annual Conference and in April met with the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1NA4T0F-rU\">North Carolina Black Press Association</a> to talk at length about African-American issues. In that discussion he acknowledged that \"we have some issues which are very specific to the African American community that have to be dealt with\" before going on to explain that \"my approach to this campaign has been to say that all Americans \u2013 black, white, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, all of us - have an interest in seeing a more just and equitable society.\" </p> <p>It is that focus on all Americans, as opposed to just African-Americans, which is bothering some people. Considering that African-Americans tend to be at the bottom end of most aspects of American life, including disproportionate incarceration rates, a 25% poverty rate (as opposed to 8% for white Americans) and major economic inequality, this is understandable. A focus on everyone is great, they argue, but it is clear that African-Americans require more attention than others. But as Obama told the hecklers, he has indeed spoken out \"forcefully\" about the issues they have accused him of ignoring: \"Listen, I was a civil rights lawyer. I passed the first racial profiling legislation in Illinois. I passed some of the toughest death penalty reform legislation in Illinois. \u2026 That doesn't mean I am always going to satisfy the way you guys want these issues framed.\"</p> <p>The way in which Obama has framed the issues has been politically savvy. African-Americans who expect Obama to run as the \"African-American candidate\" and talk all day, every day about black issues are expecting him to fail in his bid to become president. When Jesse Jackson ran on an all black platform, it did not get him anywhere close to where Obama is now. </p> <p>The truth is that most Americans who Obama would be representing as president and therefore needs to appeal to care more about the economy, Iraq and the housing crisis than Jena 6. It does not mean, however, that African-American issues are not important, just that they are being addressed as just one part of the wider political whole. People may indeed have more success with these issues on a state or local level.</p> <p>Furthermore, the questions about what the next president will do to solve problems within the black community are not just for Obama. McCain \u2013 currently not so far behind Obama in the polls - should also be held to task.</p> <p>I understand why some African-Americans expect Obama to champion their causes more often and more publicly. However, by now they should have realised that Obama's campaign is not about them. At the end of the day, Obama may be an African-American, but he is an African-American whose role, should he become president, will be to stand for all people, regardless of race.</p>",
  "<p>Mauritania's new ruling junta, which seized power in a coup yesterday, has promised to hold free and fair elections in the impoverished north-west African nation \"as soon as possible\".</p> <p>The military regime did not give a date or explain publicly its ousting of the president, Sidi Cheikh Ould Abdallahi, who was elected last year.</p> <p>The president and his parliament had been at odds over corruption claims and Abdallahi's policy of engaging with Islamic radicals.</p> <p>The bloodless coup \u2013 heralded by troops on the streets of the capital, Nouakchott, and state TV and radio going off the air \u2013 was staged when Abdallahi fired the country's top four generals, reportedly for supporting parliament. One of those sacked was Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, the head of the presidential guard, who led the coup.</p> <p>\"We will engage in a dialogue with all the political parties and all civic institutions in organising these elections,\" the junta said in a statement today. Until the elections, Mauritania will be governed by an 11-member military council.</p> <p>Life in the former French colony, Africa's newest oil-producing nation, has remained largely unaffected. In Nouakchott, shops, transport and public administration seemed to be operating normally.</p> <p>Mauritania has had repeated coups since independence in 1960. Last March, Abdallahi replaced a military junta that had ruled since toppling an earlier president, Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya, in 2005. Taya had himself seized power in 1984.</p> <p>The generals' action was condemned yesterday by the African Union, EU and US. The ousted president's daughter, Amal Mint Cheikh Abdallahi, released a message today urging the UN to help restore the democratic government and saying she and her father remained under house arrest.</p> <p>Mauritania, largely desert and twice the size of France, has a population of more than 3 million. It is an Islamic republic, the westernmost member of the 22-strong Arab League and one of the world's poorest countries. It is an ally of the US in its \"war on terror\" and has diplomatic relations with Israel.</p>",
  "<p>The news of the potential impeachment of President Pervez Musharraf means further political instability for Pakistan - at least in the short term.</p> <p>Though a deal has finally been done between the Pakistan People's party (PPP), effectively led by the late Benazir Bhutto's husband, Asif Zardari, and Nawaz Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League-N (PML-N), this indicates a very temporary coincidence of interest rather than a new solidarity. The beleaguered president's decision not to go to China for the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games indicates he is taking the threat seriously.</p> <p>No Pakistani president has ever been impeached and the procedure laid down in the 1973 constitution is likely to mean a classic drawn-out Pakistani politico-legal wrangle. Impeachment is a political process relying on a two-thirds majority of both houses of parliament deciding to remove the president from office on grounds of gross misconduct, physical or mental impairment or violation of the constitution. </p> <p>Musharraf's declaration of a state of emergency last November, shortly after getting himself re-elected for a second five-year term, means the third option is the most likely to be invoked.</p> <p>But the PPP and the PML-N will need help from smaller groupings - including hardline religious elements and a significant number of the 17 independent parliamentarians - to get the impeachment through the National Assembly. Such support is uncertain at best and all assembly members - and particularly the independents - are likely to be the subject of frantic horse-trading.</p> <p>\"They will be seen as up for sale,\" said Rasul Bakhsh Rais, Professor of Political Science at Lahore University of Management Sciences.</p> <p>Equally Musharraf still has powerful and wealthy political allies such as the loyalists of the reduced but still effective Pakistan Muslim League-Q. And, any impeachment could prove to be unpopular at home and overseas. With Pakistan suffering an economic crisis and \"a grave threat from terrorism\" there is \"a feeling that this is not the moment to be divisive,\" Rais said.</p> <p>The issues of the restoration of around 60 judges removed from their posts by Musharraf when he declared the emergency last year is directly linked to the impeachment. \"They have to be restored otherwise the case that the president has acted unconstitutionally is not convincing,\" said Professor Osama Siddique, an expert in constitutional law in Pakistan.</p> <p>A simpler way of ousting Musharraf may simply be to use the threat of the impeachment to force him to opt for a confidence vote. However, given that he is unlikely to win, the president will resist such a move if he can.</p> <p>The west will be watching the evolving relations between the military and Pakistan's political leaders closely. A recent attempt to subject the country's powerful Inter Services Intelligence service (ISI) to civilian authority backfired badly. Though Musharraf still has some friends within the sprawling military establishment, few analysts believe the army will intervene. That February's general election was largely free and fair was in part due to the new Chief of Army Staff, General Ashfaq Kiyani. Many soldiers now consider the president as something of an embarrassment.</p> <p>The real winner may eventually be Nawaz Sharif, a two-time former prime minister who returned to Pakistan from exile in Saudi Arabia last year.</p> <p>Despite having little time to prepare a campaign, Sharif's PML-N party did well in the spring elections, especially in the key province of the Punjab.</p> <p>Sharif has the vote of much of the religiously conservative, patriotic commercial middle class in Pakistan's rapidly growing cities and has his finger on the popular pulse more than any other politician. And it is Sharif, who detests the president, who has pushed hard for impeachment.</p> <p>Musharraf still has the theoretical constitutional right to dissolve parliament - subject to eventual supreme court approval. This is the political smart bomb that the president could use to delay his impeachment - but only at the cost of provoking a new election and giving Sharif, who he ousted in 1999, the chance to consolidate his power. Whatever the result of this latest crisis, it is Sharif who is likely to come out on top.</p>",
  "<p><br> I don't know nothing about no cocaine smuggling ... John Gotti Jr and possible casting choice Matt Damon. Photos: AP/Louis Lanzano and PR</p> <p>Spare a thought for hapless John Gotti Jr, good-egg son of the Dapper Don, who wants nothing more than to wash his hands of mafia life and run, I don't know, a waste disposal outfit or something. Trouble is the feds won't let him be. They're in his face and up his ass and they won't give an honest guy a break. Next thing you know Junior's been charged with crimes relating to three New York murders and cocaine trafficking when naturally he don't know nothing about it and, like, wasn't even there when those cocksuckers got iced.</p> <p>That, in a nutshell, is the concept for this week's Casting the News, liberally adapted from the current <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/06/internationalcrime.usa\">Gotti Jr case</a> and in dire need of a cast and crew. Now cruder, less nuanced producers would doubtless go the GoodFellas/Sopranos route with this one. But we're cut from a finer cloth and are prepared to take Junior at his word.</p> <p>Do you see what this does to the film? Instead of a mafia movie, we have an altogether tastier prospect: an anti-mafia movie about an everyday Joe who keeps getting blamed for the sins of his dad and finds his new life rudely gate-crashed by all manner of embarrassing relations intent on calling in old favours. But should this be played as comedy or tragedy? That's for you to decide.</p> <p>First up we need a <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/gfx/images/news/photos/2006/09/27/gotti-johnjr-cp-10824410.jpg\">Gotti Jr</a>, the poignant everyman who is installed by his father as the \"stooge leader\" (Wikipedia's words, not mine) of the <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/OrganizedCrimeSyndicates/GambinoFamily.html\">Gambino crime family</a> and is desperate to wriggle free (Matt Damon, with specs and a dye job might do at a push). You'll also need a <a href=\"http://gangstersinc.tripod.com/John.html\">Gotti Sr</a> for all those anguished flashback scenes (is De Niro too obvious a choice?). And finally we need to cast <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_Trucchio\">Ronnie \"One Arm\" Trucchio</a> and John Alite, Junior's rumble-tumble compadres. These would either play the role of comic buffoons or scary interlopers, depending on what genre you choose.</p> <p>Either way, I have an inkling that these supporting players may well end up stealing the show, perhaps even going on to secure their own spin-off buddy movie. The inclusion of <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2008/08/05/2008-08-05_old_pal_ties_junior_gotti_to_3_mob_hits-3.html\">John Alite</a>, for instance, opens the door for a peach of a subplot.</p> <p>In real life, Alite is best known for a dazzling good deed gone wrong. A few years back he attempted to smuggle sperm extracted from a convicted mobster out of jail in order to impregnate the man's lovelorn wife. \"Her biological clock was ticking,\" Alite complained at the time. \"She wanted to have a baby. I can't believe I got sent to prison for something like that.\" The fertile don. The anxious wife. The gallant inseminator. It is an adventure simply crying out to be put on screen.</p> <p>So here's what we need - your cut-and-paste credits ...</p> <p>John Gotti Jr</p> <p>John Gotti Sr (aka \"the Dapper Don\")</p> <p>Ronnie \"One Arm\" Trucchio</p> <p>John \"Sticky Fingers\" Alite</p> <p>Director</p> <p>Title</p> <p>Tagline</p> <p>And whoops, just time to quickly greenlight last week's <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/film/2008/07/casting_the_news_miliband_the.html\">Miliband: The Motion Picture</a>. For the title role, I'm torn between Jamie12's suggestion of Tim Henman and Joseph Kern's lobbying for Ioan Gruffud (perhaps we could try a refracted, Todd Haynes-style approach, reflecting Dave's double role as loyal foreign secretary and scheming pretender). Kudos to Alexis De Toqueville for hiring Guillermo Del Toro to direct - here is a tale that could use some fairytale imps.</p> <p>Likewise there is something dementedly inspired about tonibryan's choice of noble Viggo Mortensen to play toadying, treacherous Jack Straw. I can see him now, nodding eager, owl-eyed approval at Brown's back during PMQs while simultaneously gauging exactly where to plant the knife. Great Poochini's tagline - \"Used to Be Nobody Could Sneak Up On Brown\" - strikes just the right note of simmering macho menace.</p>",
  "<p>One of John McCain's campaign weak spots is his age, so <a href=\"http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/64ad536a6d\">cruelly mocked by Paris Hilton</a> earlier this week. With that in mind, was it really a good idea for his website to include <a href=\"http://www.johnmccain.com/McCainTimeline/\">this timeline</a>?</p> <p> </p> <p>You could understand it if it compared the Arizona senator's lifetime of service to the United States as a soldier and politician with the more slight life experience of Barack Obama, who is 25 years his junior.</p> <p>But it doesn't. Instead the timeline is matched to US history, and stretches back to 1840, leading the casual reader to assume McCain is a sprightly 168 years old.</p> <p>As such, it includes the American civil war, the Spanish-Amercian war and the 1871 Chicago fire, as well as the birth of \"Slew\" McCain, the Republican candidate's grandfather, in 1884. Even ignoring the events that took place before McCain's birth, the timeline can't help but draw attention to the fact that the young McCain lived through not just the second world war but also the Great Depression.</p> <p>To make matters worse, the whole thing is navigated using a \"time shuttle\", which makes it sound like the reader is travelling back to the stone age. If this is their idea of presenting their candidate in a good light, it's probably best all round that the McCain campaign is mainly concentrating on attacking his opponent.</p>",
