  "<p>Well, pressure seems to work sometimes. Late today at an event in Minnesota, McCain <a href=\"http://thepage.time.com/2008/10/10/stop-the-presses/\">actually quieted the mob</a>.</p> <p>I just saw the video on Hardball, 7 pm edition (Hardball is also on at 5 pm but I'm pretty sure they didn't have it then, so it seems to have happened just very recently). A woman calls Obama an Arab. McCain, standing right next to her, shakes his head no and demands the mic: \"No, ma'am. He is a decent family man with whom I happen to have some disagreements.\"</p> <p>Then, in what context I'm not sure, he says: \"I have to tell you, he is a decent person, a person that you do not have to be scared [of] as president of the United States.\"</p> <p>His polling must be telling him that the vaguely Bavarian odor of some of the recent rallies hasn't been winning him voters. He must also feel personally stung by the lacerating criticism from journalists, \"his base.\" So this is a tactical rather than moral retreat. Still, good for him, I guess. Of course, he's still running innuendo-laden ads devoted entirely to Obama's character, and essentially 100% of his TV advertising, as opposed to 50% of Obama's, is negative.</p> <p>When he said the thing about not having to be scared of Obama, there were scattered catcalls and yells of \"Noooo!\" It'll be interesting to see whether this scene repeats itself over the weekend.<br></p>",
  "<p><strong>Downing Street Diary: With James Callaghan in No 10</strong><br>by Bernard Donoughue<br>562pp, Jonathan Cape, \u00a330</p> <p><strong>Tony's Ten Years: Memories of the Blair Administration</strong><br>by Adam Boulton<br>368pp, Simon &amp; Schuster, \u00a317.99</p> <p>If you can't stand the heat, as President Harry S Truman so nearly said, keep out of the kitchen cabinet. Here is Bernard Donoughue, having somehow survived the torrid three years as senior policy adviser to Harold Wilson which he chronicled in volume one, bravely soldiering on alongside Wilson's successor, James Callaghan. Initially that's a relief: the court of King James is a pleasanter, less pressured place than the paranoid court of King Harold. The most important reason for that can be summed up in two words: Marcia's gone. </p> <p>All those tantrums and tears and petty revenges that punctuated Donoughue's version of life with Wilson are over. Jim is a rather more admirable figure than Donoughue had until now suspected; decent, shrewd, unexpectedly modest, still amazed to find he's reached the top of the tree, and endearingly old-fashioned. He's embarrassed by nudity on TV especially when his children are present, though these children are now in their 30s. Lady Falkender's role as the wicked witch of SW1 is played this time by HM Treasury, so devious, so duplicitous, constantly evading the issue, serving up documents only when it believes that no one will have enough time to spot what it's up to, bouncing the politicians by all available means, and innately suspicious of change: an indictment which by the end of the book seems to have spread to most of the civil service. But the office is a far more agreeable place than it was. Donoughue is missing his old comrade in arms Joe Haines, Wilson's press secretary, but he gets along fine with Callaghan's political adviser, Tom McNally, until with an election approaching McNally becomes preoccupied with his fight to get elected for Stockport (or as Donoughue more often calls it, Stockton; the book is marred by too many such errors).</p> <p>It all ends in tears, of course, with the winter of discontent. Even Callaghan, at the end of his term, is clearly not up to it. In his kindly old-fashioned way he cannot and will not stand up to the unions, and many of those about him are equally feeble. Does Jim, the author muses as the fatal date with the electors draws near, even want to win any more? Wouldn't he rather go back to the farm? The question of whether he deserves to win isn't answered in so many words, but it sounds in Donoughue's formulation like a question expecting the answer no. </p> <p>Like the Wilson volume, this is a vivid and often gripping first-hand account of life at the very heart of events. Adam Boulton, the respected political editor of Sky News, never gets such close access to Blair, though here too there's a lively account of kitchen cabinet turmoil. Cherie cannot conceal her envy of Blair's director of government relations, Anji Hunter. Cherie fails to invite her to a celebration party for the 1997 election victory. Later, Cherie and her ally Fiona Millar arraign Anji before what Boulton calls a kangaroo court. Later still, Cherie and Fiona fall out over the role of Carole Caplin, who has been brought in to restyle her. Yet all that is heavily overshadowed by the brooding, bullying presence of Blair's director of communications and strategy Alastair Campbell, who treats his boss with public disdain, is allowed to order civil servants about, deliberately and consistently lies to the media, and gets away with breaking the rule, observed by Donoughue, that kitchen cabinet secrets must remain unrevealed for 30 years.</p> <p>The interweaving of the political and the personal influences the shape of this book. For just as Fiona Millar is the partner of Alastair Campbell, the nearest thing this book has to a villain, so Anji Hunter, the nearest thing it has to a heroine, is the second Mrs Adam Boulton. As Adam explains in the preface, Anji sticks (unCampbell-like) by the rules and has had no hand in these memoirs, which could clearly have been a richer account of the politics and the personalities at the court of King Tony had she been less scrupulous. This perhaps is one reason why I found the book less revelatory than I'd expected. Essentially what Boulton has done is to take the last 58 days of Blair's premiership and use them to open windows on what happened before. Thus his speech at Reuters on the \"feral media\" becomes the peg for a review of the prime minister's relationship with the media; his final press conference in Brussels sets off a review of his record on Europe. It is diligently done on the basis of praise - especially for Northern Ireland and Africa - and blame, for Blair's presidential pretensions, his subservience to Bush, his conduct over the death of Dr Kelly - though Campbell is fingered there too. </p> <p>Boulton has his revelations - the fact that the so called \"deal\" between Brown and Blair at Granita was in truth a mere understanding, and reached rather earlier in Edinburgh; the moment after the death of Diana when Prince Philip was overheard on the telephone telling an intrusive Blair to fuck off - but he doesn't go in for melodrama. He portrays the Blair/Brown relationship not as the biggest fraternal spat since Cain and Abel but as a creative tension from which for much of the time the government benefited. If the book doesn't offer many excitements, that is also because as a political editor Boulton made it his job to pass on what he knew immediately to his audience, rather than keeping the juiciest bits for the book and a Daily Mail serialisation. And who knows: those who are still around in 2037 may at last come to learn what Anji still hasn't told Adam.</p> <p>\u2022 McKie's Gazetteer: A Local History of Britain is published by Atlantic</p>",
  "<p>All viewers of The West Wing know that the back-stairs acronym for the leader of the free world is Potus but the narrator of this remarkable novel identifies herself to us as Flotus: First Lady of the United States. She's Alice Blackwell, born Lindgren, but, as writer Curtis Sittenfeld acknowledges even before the title page, she is \"inspired by the life of an American first lady\".</p> <p>Like Laura Bush, Alice, as a teenager, is driving a car which is involved in an accident that kills a male classmate. Trapped in a self-image of guilt-ridden tragedy, she is distracted by boorish Charlie Blackwell, who bowls through his life on blow-job jokes and too much booze, making him an embarrassment to his family, who are grandees of the Republican party. Alice's wisdom and loyalty eventually get him off the bottle and to the top of American politics.</p> <p>As Charlie goofs around the White House, joking about the impending merger between General Electric and Alitalia - \"They're going to call the company Genitalia!\" - the reader sees and hears George W Bush. Charlie too is elected by a Supreme Court decision. </p> <p>Yet, in other respects, this topical simulacram diverges from the biographical model: Princeton rather than Yale, money from meat rather than oil, a father who was a state governor rather than a former president.</p> <p>This combination of the looked-up and the made-up within a single narrative is a recurrent controversy of this genre of faction. Because Charlie and Alice so often exactly reflect Dubya and Laura, a tension develops when a certain detail - an abortion - is not immediately recognisable or verifiable. In a novel that will inevitably be read as a biography, there is a risk of fictional invention polluting the historical record.</p> <p>Such qualms, though, are reduced by the fact that this is such an accomplished work of fiction. Becoming far more than a Bush administration equivalent to Joe Klein's Clinton-inspired Primary Colors, this is a thoughtful and compelling examination of the mechanics of family and marriage. Numerous scenes - a family car outing, the body language of a failing marriage, the decline of an elderly relative - display a shrewd universality. A reader allergic to news could enjoy it as pure fiction.</p> <p>Sittenfeld's most impressive achievement is to imagine convincingly what it might be like for your private life to become public property. Suffering feelings of worthlessness not restricted to the automobile slaughter of her boyfriend, the narrator, purely through an accident of marriage, becomes the subject of lavish White House galas titled \"Students and Teachers Salute Alice Blackwell!\" And a once a simple morning ritual - reading the morning newspaper - becomes for Alice, in the White House, a strategic exercise in trying to reach the arts section without reading the many pieces denigrating her husband, yet taking in enough to answer, in \"a neutral tone\", his bullish inquiry: \"How'd I mess up the world today?\" While Charlie conjures up the chimpish grin of GWB, Alice is a much more subtle creation, defying the laws of narrative physics by being Laura Bush and somehow not being her. The novel turns on an act of betrayal which, though unlikely to be precisely mirrored in the present administration, is a psychologically satisfying dramatisation of how trauma from the past might shape future actions. It also encourages us to reflect on what it might be like to find that the person you loved has become the most unpopular and untrusted man in the world. Knowing and knowledgeable, yet also inventive and original, American Wife is, in an election year of unprecedented drama, a thrilling combination of history and surprises.</p> <p>\u2022 Mark Lawson's Enough is Enough: Or the Emergency Government is published by Picador</p>",
  "<p>Clear a space at the top of the hit parade: Boy George has got a new single coming out. It's called Yes We Can and it includes samples from Barack Obama's speech alongside some meaningful and important lyrics about there not being any time for indifference, making it \"to the promised land\" and so on. George explains the single like this: \"I was deeply moved and motivated by Obama's 'Yes We Can' speech and I used it as a metaphor for personal change, because there have been huge changes in my own life this past year. Yes We Can equates as Yes I Can from my own personal perspective and like many people I am excited by the prospect of Obama being the first black man in the White House and the next president of America.\" </p> <p>The cynic might translate this as, \"Oh me me me! I'm not American or a black man, but I want in on this whole empowering yes-we-can business so I am making it about me'n'my struggles.\" This said, it's a lovely song, and the way George sings the line \"please forgive me for crimes against myself, I'll forgive your lack of faith\" is properly brilliant. It's a shame the presentation of the song is so stupendously lame because at the heart of this track is a beautiful and reflective song about a boy who, finally, seems to have grown up. </p> <p>There's a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFL9FBlu75o\">great clip on YouTube</a> of George performing the track acoustically at Abbey Road studios. Mind you, let's be honest, there's also a great clip on YouTube of a dog on a swing, so let's not get too excited. Tuneage aside, there are probably questions to be asked about whether \"yes we can\" is really ready to be hijacked by Boy George for the purposes of exploring his own personal demons; after all, it's a phrase Obama hasn't really finished with. </p> <p>Maybe George has missed a trick here, and the ideal outcome would be for him to take this generic, one-size-liberates-all usage of \"yes we can\" to its logical conclusions. What would be sensible would be for George to fully embrace the long-tail approach to pop, and record personalised versions of the song to cover the woes and annoyances of anyone who cares to buy it - somewhere between the concepts of patronage and knocking out handjobs round the back of Halfords for a fiver. It would certainly be better than George's own video: a computer-generated effort featuring Amy Winehouse (because she's so persecuted etc) which screams \"2004\" so loudly that it might as well include footage of Beagle 2. </p> <p>But ignore the video, ignore the stupid hats, and you're left with a tune which is surprisingly human and feels, in spite of everything, strangely unopportunistic.</p> <p>\u2022 Yes We Can is released on Sun 12 on Upside+</p>",
  "<p>It built up over the course of the week, as supporters at the rallies of John McCain and Sarah Palin started randomly screaming \"terrorist!\" and \"off with his head!\" and \"treason!\" and even \"kill him!\" at the mention of Barack Obama's name.</p> <p>Then there was the man at a Florida rally who shouted at an African-American CNN cameraman: \"Sit down, boy.\" You don't need to know your history of the American south to know that \"boy\", directed at a black man, is overtly and undeniably racist.</p> <p>But things got worse on Thursday in Wisconsin, when a man stood up to \"ask\" a \"question\" and, veins popping in his neck, delivered himself of the following: \"I'm mad. I'm really mad. And what's gonna surprise ya is not the economy. It's the socialists takin' over our country. [Lengthy applause] Sit down. I'm not done. Let me finish, please [laughter] ... when you have Obama, [Nancy] Pelosi and the rest of the hooligans up there gonna run this country, we gotta have our head examined. It's time that you two are representing us, and we are mad! So go get 'em!\" [Extended chanting: \"USA! USA! USA!\"]</p> <p>Meanwhile, videos are circulating of McCain supporters expressing their views of Obama as they enter rallies. Is Obama a terrorist, they are asked? He's \"a one-man terror cell\". \"He's got the bloodlines. Just think about it, look at the name.\" \"Socialist swine.\"</p> <p>We are seeing, from (happily, at least for the time being) the majority of the country, much of what is good and decent about America in this election. But we are also seeing in smaller proportion what is chilling. The people in those videos have no proof to back up their beliefs, because of course no such proof exists. They just feel it, and that's enough. But that isn't what's most disturbing. There will always be such people in all societies. What's most disturbing is that McCain and Palin are egging them on. </p> <p>Not once in any of the above situations did McCain, a man who has subjected the rest of us to lectures about how important his integrity is, step in to say: \"Now wait a second, folks.\" To the Wisconsin man quoted above, McCain said: \"Well, I think I got the message. And could I just say, the gentleman is right.\"</p> <p>McCain and Palin are doing even worse than that. The emotional core of their campaign now is Obama's alleged close relationship with Bill Ayers, the former terrorist who, long before Obama came on the Chicago scene, was welcomed back into Chicago society and became an education professor. They are demanding that Obama confess the real nature of this relationship.</p> <p>Now usually, when a candidate calls on his opponent to own up about something, there is a specific allegation on the table. A newspaper has published an investigation, say, and the opponent hasn't yet confronted the charges therein, and the candidate demands that the opponent do so. Even if the candidate himself leaked all the material to the newspaper as a set-up so that the candidate could then, once the charges were \"impartially\" published, go out and demand the opponent come clean, well, that's how the game is sometimes played.</p> <p>But in this case, there are no serious specific allegations. Only dark intimations of intense ideological kinship. \"[Obama] has dismissed it by saying he was just a guy in the neighbourhood,\" McCain said in an interview. \"You know it's much more than that. Let's reveal all the details of that relationship and then the American people can make a judgment.\"</p> <p>McCain knows nothing specific here. He's fishing, wishing and hinting. Obama and Ayers served on a board and a commission together. Average people may not know how boards and commissions work, but McCain knows very well that they typically meet a few times a year and that co-board membership implies nothing about deeper friendship. More broadly, McCain also has to know that the entire issue is pathetic. Obama is now one of the most examined men in the world. </p> <p>No one has turned up actual evidence of radical beliefs. He's pretty much a standard liberal with, if anything, a cautious bent that seeks to placate adversaries, a picture we have on the authority of his former conservative colleagues at the Harvard Law Review, who found him an accommodating consensus-builder.</p> <p>This is standard guilt-by-association gruel that we expect to find on borderline-psychotic websites. But an alleged man of integrity ought to know better. And he does, I'm certain, understand the nature of the difference between asking a man to answer specific allegations and demanding that he disprove vague accusations (\"it's much more than that\"), and he knows how doing the latter will reflect on him.</p> <p>But he's a desperate man, watching his decades-long dream slip away, no doubt infuriated that this neophyte who hasn't suffered as he has is running circles around him. That's a shame for him, but McCain's mental state is not the thing to be worried about here. The thing to be worried about is the impact that his campaign - \"a national disgrace,\" wrote Joe Klein of Time magazine - is having on the nation.</p> <p> He and Palin - \"his Sancho Panza\", as George Will mockingly wrote in the Washington Post - are deliberately stoking rage that is based on lies that they know to be lies (well, that at least McCain knows to be lies). The normally reserved commentator David Gergen said: \"There is this free floating sort of whipping around anger that could really lead to some violence. I think we're not far from that.\"</p> <p>We are seeing the dark, Gothic heart of resentment conservatism. It's going to be a disgusting three weeks.</p>",

  "<p>Barack Obama will use his financial superiority over John McCain to dominate the airwaves in the final days of the election with a half-hour, primetime special.</p> <p>Campaign officials said yesterday that they were negotiating with CBS, NBC and Fox television for a half-hour broadcast on October 29, six days before Americans go to the polls. The media blitz represents the most ambitious - and by far the costliest - use of media in a presidential election.</p> <p>\"Strategically, this is about as big a megaphone as money will buy at this point,\" said Evan Tracey of the Campaign Media Analysis Group. \"Obama, as a former lawyer, will probably make a fairly well articulated closing argument with the production value of a Steven Spielberg movie.\" He estimated the cost of airtime would be at least $1m (\u00a3590,000) for each network.</p> <p>Short political ads have been the traditional way for politicians to communicate with voters. But a primetime, sitcom-length commercial would provide Obama an opportunity to make a closing argument to the entire country.</p> <p>\"It's a luxury to be able to afford that kind of communication,\" said Tad Devine, a Democratic media consultant who was a senior adviser to John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign.</p> <p>Former candidates have departed from the traditional advertising format to buy blocks of airtime. In 1992, Ross Perot bought time on network television and Hillary Clinton paid for an hour-long town hall special on Lifetime television, a cable network aimed at women, during the Democratic primary.</p> <p>McCain, who took public financing, is on an $84m budget for these elections. Obama has no such constraints. He increased his spending on television advertising to $3m a day this week, and is expected to spend more as the election approaches. The McCain camp, in contrast, spent about $1.6m a day.</p> <p>In some key battlegrounds, such as northern Virginia or southern Florida, that amounts to a four-to-one advantage for Obama in airtime.</p> <p>In an attempt to compete, the McCain camp has resorted to trying to use the media to find an audience for its ads. In recent days, the Republicans have put out daily video releases. The so-called ads are seldom aired on television and instead rely on YouTube or cable television news broadcasts to find an audience.</p> <p>Yesterday's offering from the McCain camp again showed the Republican stepping up the negative tone. The ad directly accuses Obama of lying about his association with a former 60s-era radical, Bill Ayers. The commercial, which the McCain camp said would be aired nationally, is arguably his sharpest yet, and uses Obama's link to Ayers to assert Obama has \"blind ambition\" and \"bad judgment.\"</p> <p>The National Rifle Association is also running ads against Obama, while internet-driven rumours have falsely claimed he is a Muslim. Obama, who was campaigning in Ohio yesterday, said Americans want \"someone who can lead this country\" in a time of economic crisis, not divide it.</p> <p>Referring to McCain and Palin, he told an audience in the town of Chillicothe, Ohio, \"it's not hard to rile up a crowd by stoking anger and division\". Noting that McCain advisers have said their candidate will lose if the campaign's focus stays on the economy, Obama said: \"So in the last couple of days, we've seen a barrage of nasty insinuations and attacks, and I'm sure we'll see much more over the next 25 days. We know what's coming ... But it won't work.\"</p> <p>Obama's lead practically guarantees him a huge primetime audience because of prior media coverage, as well as analysis after it is aired. The programming also adds to McCain's difficulty. If he tries to match Obama in making his closing argument, he will have to make hard choices about pulling some of his TV ads in battleground states.</p> <p>There were few details yesterday about the content of the programme. It is widely assumed the broadcast is intended to make Obama appear presidential. That means he is unlikely to resort to McCain's negative tone. Joel Rivlin, a political consultant, argued that the broadcast, which will extend far beyond the battleground states, could help Obama drive up his popular vote.</p>",
  "<p>John McCain's team yesterday delivered a pre-emptive strike against the Troopergate investigation into Sarah Palin's alleged abuse of power in Alaska that could prove to be a costly distraction from his campaign.</p> <p>With only weeks left until the election and trailing badly, McCain's team sought to minimise potential damage from the investigation due to be published last night by issuing a report of its own. The row is over an allegation that Palin, as governor of Alaska, sacked the head of the Alaskan police force, Walt Monegan, because he refused to dismiss her former brother-in-law, a state trooper, Mike Wooten.</p> <p>McCain's dossier, setting out Palin's version of events, claims the sacking was over disagreements about policy and budget, not Wooten. It portrays the sacking as \"a straightforward personnel decision\" that has become \"muddied with innuendo, rumour and partisan politics\".</p> <p>The McCain dossier says Wooten is a separate issue and goes on to say that the Palin family has good reason to be concerned about him. It accuses Wooten, who was involved in a messy divorce from Palin's younger sister, of having \"a long history of unstable and erratic behaviour\".</p> <p>The row has the potential to swamp media coverage of the campaign over the weekend, eating into valuable time for McCain as he tries to turn round his campaign. It again raises questions about his judgment in choosing a running-mate who had an investigation hanging over her. </p> <p>The McCain team's dossier comes after the failure of its repeated attempts to have publication of the official investigation delayed until after the election on November 4.</p> <p>The investigation was ordered by the Alaska senate 10 weeks ago. Palin refused to cooperate with the investigation, after initially saying in public she would. The McCain dossier dismisses the senate inquiry as a \"politically driven\". It adds: \"The Palins make no apologies for wanting to protect their family and wanting to bring attention to the injustice of a violent trooper keeping his badge.\" </p> <p>A McCain spokesman, Taylor Griffin, who distributed the campaign's dossier, said it was based on public files and an affidavit by Palin's husband, Todd. The dossier says that Sarah Palin had been clashing with Monegan since October last year over policy, in particular budgetary issues. He refused the offer of an alternative job and was sacked, the dossier says. </p> <p>It blames the linking of Monegan's sacking to the Wooten dispute on Andrew Halcro, a political rival of Palin. The paper says Halcro met Wooten for drinks over three and a half hours at a bar in Anchorage and, afterwards, Halcro became the first person to link Monegan and Wooten.</p> <p>The dossier runs over claims about Wooten that have already been made public, including that he killed a moose illegally, used a Taser on his 10-year-old stepson and threatened to kill a member of the Palin family. It says: \"Understandably concerned about a pattern of behaviour demonstrated by someone entrusted with the responsibilities of law enforcement, the Palin family reported the behaviour to the appropriate authorities.\"</p> <p>The Palins' complaints about Wooten were investigated by the police. Some were upheld but were regarded as relatively minor, reflected in the police decision in 2006 to allow him to keep his job after a short suspension, later cut in half.</p> <p>With Obama building up significant poll leads all week as a result of the public anxiety over the economic crisis, McCain could do with a weekend free to concentrate on attacking his rival rather than having to deal with Troopergate.</p> <p>The Arizona senator, who was campaigning in Wisconsin yesterday, sought to exploit links between Obama and Bill Ayers, one of the founders of the Weathermen, a radical group responsible for a wave of bombings in the 1970s.</p> <p>Palin originally made an issue of the link last weekend but McCain has now taken up the theme, accusing Obama of bad judgment. His team, sensing a vulnerability, put out an ad yesterday about the relationship between Obama and Ayers, who met in Chicago before Obama became a national figure.</p> <p>Obama, campaigning in Ohio, a key swing state, urged McCain and Palin to stop using negative tactics. \"It's not hard to rile up a crowd by stoking anger and division,\" Obama said. </p> <p>If the election were to be held today, polls suggest Obama would win by a landslide, but there are more than three weeks to go and the gap could still narrow. A poll published yesterday gave Obama an 8% lead over McCain in Florida, which was pivotal for the Republicans in 2000 and held by them again in 2004. </p> <p>McCain is resting much of his election hopes on taking Pennsylvania from the Democrats, but polls over the last few days give Obama double-digit leads, including one of 13%. </p> <p>The third of the big three swing states, Ohio, is tighter but Obama has leads of 4-6% in four polls and McCain ahead by 1% in another.</p>",
  "<p>I have indeed been wondering lately why Colin Powell hasn't endorsed Barack Obama. Powell has said nice things about Obama and speculation that an endorsement was imminent (see for example <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1554812/Powell-ready-to-jump-on-Obama-bandwagon.html\">this happily incorrect dispatch</a> from those nasty fellows at the Telegraph).</p> <p>Over at the Plank today, Noam Scheiber <a href=\"http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_stump/archive/2008/10/10/a-powell-mccain-deal-on-wright.aspx\">posts a very interesting thought</a> from one of his commenters, to wit:</p> <blockquote> <p>Call me crazy (but at least wait until you read the post) but I believe that Powell has made a deal with McCain. I will not endorse Obama in this election if you do not bring up Wright. How else to explain the dog that does not bark in the face of very favorable things he has said about Obama in the past and the adumbrations from reliable sources that a Powell endorsement for Obama was on the way? ... I admit that the only evidence I can claim I get from Sherlock Holmes: when all else has been eliminated, what remains, no matter how unlikely, must be the case. Of course, events could disprove all this should either McCain start the Wright attack or Powell come out in favor of Obama. But until that point, I am sticking to my guns.</p> </blockquote> <p>This makes sense and sounds very Powellian -- quietly throwing his weight around behind the scenes. However, I'd cast it more as a subtle threat from Powell than a deal offered by Powell, i.e., \"John, you start with that Wright business and I'll endorse Barack and go around the country and campaign for him.\" Of course, it's also very Powellian not to stick his neck out, which he doesn't like doing. And McCain may be holding Wright for the 9th inning, or he may have decided that the backlash on that would be too great at this point.</p> <p>At any rate, I still think Chuck Hagel is the bigger endorsement. Hagel is an actual Republican pol, albeit a retiring one, and he's from the heartland and he's....uh...you know...white. On a Scrabble board, the Powell tile would be worth four or five, the Hagel tile seven.</p> <p>And by the way, I have nothing against the Telegraph, in all honesty. I've only worked for the Guardian for 18 months or so. I'm a Yank. I hate Fox and Rush and the WSJ editorial page, like any decent American.<br></p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://flyers.nhl.com/\">Philadelphia Flyers</a>, nicknamed Broad Street Bullies for their hyper-aggressive style of play, won the Stanley Cup in 1974. Back then, for once, I cared about something other than baseball or football. It was easy actually, since no other city team had won a championship title in years. So after their victory, I stood at a busy intersection in my West Philly neighbourhood with a few friends. We held handmade signs and cheered. People honked their horns as they drove by and waved their own posters. The folks headed downtown to celebrate were white. We were young African-American kids.<br> To this day, however, I've never been to a Flyers game. And I'd be willing to bet many worthless dollars that there still aren't too many black fans in the seats. Of Philadelphia's four major professional sports teams, the Flyers easily have the whitest fan base. Hockey doesn't have the reputation of being an inclusive sport.  So is adoration from a mostly white, male, suburban crowd what Sarah Palin is counting on when she <a href=\"http://flyers.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&amp;page=NewsPage&amp;articleid=385526\">drops the puck at the ceremonial face-off at the Flyers' home opener</a> on Saturday night? Say what you like about political strategies, but this move has all the makings of the <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/inquirer/sports/30735884.html\">biggest political miscalculation</a> since former Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis tried to boost his national security mojo 20 years ago by <a href=\"http://www.digitaljournalist.org/issue0309/lm10.html\">riding around in a tank</a> when he was the Democratic presidential nominee. We know how that turned out.<br> Philadelphia is one of the bluest cities in the country, and even Pennsylvania's days as battleground state may be winding down. The latest polls show Barack Obama up over John McCain in <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/pa/pennsylvania_mccain_vs_obama-244.html\">double digits statewide</a>.<br> But Palin's Philadelphia problem is mixing sports and politics in a town that takes its sports very seriously - especially at a time when people are seeking refuge from the no-end-in-sight economic meltdown and the increasingly ugly presidential campaign. Philly sports fans have a well-deserved reputation as <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/writers/phil_taylor/12/07/booing/index.html\">some of the most obnoxious fans in the country</a>. The \"Philadelphia cheer\", is an ear-splitting, soul-cleansing \"boo\". Go at less than full throttle, and a player will get booed. Injured players? They get booed, too. How about Santa Claus? You guessed it, he's gotten booed. How about controversial vice-presidential candidates? You get my drift. Perhaps the McCain campaign didn't get that memo.<br> Now that doesn't mean things won't turn out well for the governor in an arena full of hockey soul mates. The Flyers' management bills her as \"the nation's most popular hockey mom\". (Ed Snider, the Flyers' owner, is a McCain campaign donor.) She could get both boos and cheers, similar to the welcome that George Bush received when he <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080330&amp;content_id=2467665&amp;vkey=news_was&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=was\">threw out the first ball</a> for the Washington Nationals baseball team's opening game earlier this year. She could get a standing ovation. Nothing is impossible.<br> But Palin's last trip to the City of Brotherly Love didn't go quite as planned. During the obligatory Philly cheesesteak shop stop that candidates make when they head into town looking for votes, Temple University graduate student <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/hp/news_update/20081007_Mistaken_identity_and__gotcha_journalism_.html\">Michael Rovito asked the governor whether American troops should pursue terrorists into Pakistan</a>. She said yes, an answer that put her at odds with McCain's position on the issue. <br> If the chatter in the blogosphere is any indication, fans going to the game are looking for any way to express their outrage, from obscene chants to hoisting Obama-Biden signs, at an appearance viewed as a political intrusion. The Flyers will play the <a href=\"http://rangers.nhl.com/\">New York Rangers</a>, so there will probably be more than a few extroverts from 90 minutes up the road in the crowd, too.<br> When people who don't normally watch hockey games are planning on tuning in to see not just whether people will boo, but how long and loudly they will boo, that tells you something. Much has changed since 1974, but one thing hasn't: Philly fans welcome any excuse to exercise their lungs. Now that a politician's photo-ops trump serious discussions in our brave new world of political discourse, events like this one take on a lopsided importance as barometers of regional moods. Even so, you've got to wonder why the McCain campaign just doesn't call the whole thing off.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama will use his financial superiority over John McCain to dominate the airwaves in the final days of the US election with a half-hour, prime-time special.</p> <p>Campaign officials said today that they were negotiating with CBS, NBC and Fox television for a half-hour broadcast on October 29, six days before Americans go to the polls. The media blitz represents the most ambitious - and by far the costliest - use of media in a presidential election.</p> <p>\"Strategically, this is about as big a megaphone as money will buy at this point,\" said Evan Tracey of the Campaign Media Analysis Group. \"Obama, as a former lawyer, will probably make a fairly well articulated closing argument with the production value of a Steven Spielberg movie.\"</p> <p>He estimated the cost of airtime would be at least $1m (\u00a3590,000) for each network.</p> <p>Former candidates have departed from the traditional advertising format to buy blocks of airtime. In 1992, Ross Perot bought time on network television and Hillary Clinton paid for an hour-long town hall special on Lifetime television, a cable network aimed at women, during the Democratic primary campaign.</p> <p>McCain, who took public financing, is on an $84m budget for these elections. Obama has no such constraints. The candidate this week increased his spending on television advertising to $3m a day, and is expected to spend even more as the election approaches. The McCain camp, in contrast, spent about $1.6m a day.</p> <p>In some key battlegrounds, such as northern Virginia or southern Florida, that amounts to a four-to-one advantage for Obama in airtime.</p> <p>In an attempt to compete, the McCain camp has resorted to trying to use the media to find an audience for its ads. In recent days, the Republicans have put out daily video releases. The so-called ads are seldom aired on television and instead rely on YouTube or cable television news broadcasts to find an audience.</p> <p>Today's offering from the McCain camp again showed the Republican stepping up the negative tone of his ads. The ad, which the McCain camp said would be aired nationally, directly accuses Obama of lying about his association with former 60s-era radical Bill Ayers.</p> <p>Obama's purchase practically guarantees the Democrat a huge prime-time audience because of prior media coverage, as well as analysis after it is aired.</p> <p>The prime-time programming also increases McCain's bind. If he tries to match Obama in making his own closing argument, the Republican will have to make hard choices about pulling some of his television ads in battleground states.</p> <p>There were few immediate details today about the content of the programme. It is widely assumed that the broadcast is intended to make Obama appear presidential. That means he is unlikely to resort to the negative tone of McCain's public appearances.</p> <p>Joel Rivlin, a political consultant, argued that the broadcast, which will extend far beyond the battleground states, could help Obama drive up his popular vote.</p> <p>If he were elected, that would allow Obama to claim a greater mandate to lead - which could help the Democrat in the current economic and political climate.</p> <p>\"Maybe it talks to him trying to run up the score in order to get more of a mandate to govern,\" Rivlin said. \"It could be something to do with increasing his popular vote nationally.\"<br></p>",
  "<p>Recent work by leading economists suggests that a new consensus is emerging on free trade agreements. Gone is the doctrine of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Consensus\">Washington consensus</a> which preached signing trade deals with any nation that is willing. A narrow but significant accord is emerging that says smaller regional and bilateral trade agreements are bad for the world economy. Perhaps then, Senator Barack Obama's <a href=\"http://www.barackobama.com/issues/economy/\">call</a> to rethink deals like Nafta is not so protectionist but really in line with <a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/publication/15653/obamas_freetrade_credentials_top_clintons.html\">contemporary economic thinking</a>. </p> <p>One of the world's most well-known trade economists is <a href=\"http://www.columbia.edu/~jb38/\">Jagdish Bhagwati</a> of Columbia University. In the early part of his career he spawned technical innovations to trade theory that are taught in any serious textbook of international economics. In recent decades he has served as free trade's champion in accessible books and short articles.</p> <p>His recent book, <a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/publication/15840/\">Termites of the Trading System: How Preferential Agreements Undermine Free Trade</a>, came as a shock to those who count him as an academic ally in the campaign for free trade. Bhagwati argues that trade deals like Nafta or the pending <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/03/20080312-3.html\">US-Colombia Free Trade Agreement</a> are \"termites\" that are eroding the world trading system and world economy.</p> <p>Why are these deals so bad? Bhagwati shows that they divert trade away from those nations with a true <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/research/economics/alphabetic.cfm?term=comparativeadvantage#comparativeadvantage\">comparative advantage</a>. Such advantages occur when every nation produces and exports from those sectors where their mix of land, labor and capital is most abundant. Liberalising tariffs and other barriers then means producers get access to more markets, and consumers have better choices and lower prices. </p> <p>In this scenario all nations benefit because they produce where they have a comparative advantage. Throw in these small trade deals and all of a sudden we are buying shirts from countries like Honduras rather than from China and Mexico where they can be produced more efficiently and come at a lower price. The crux of Bhagwati's argument is that foregoing those lower prices costs us in terms of \"trade diversion\". Indeed, the World Bank's 2005 Global Economic Prospects puts the price of trade diversion due to deals like Nafta between $115bn and $150bn on an annual basis. </p> <p>Another of the more eminent global trade and development economists is <a href=\"http://ksghome.harvard.edu/~drodrik/\">Dani Rodrik</a> of Harvard University. Rodrik and Bhagwati often disagree, but Rodrik's new book: <a href=\"http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8494.html\">One Economy, Many Recipes: Globalisation, Institutions, and Economic Growth</a>, also argues that many trade agreements are out of whack with economic theory - albeit from a different vantage point.</p> <p>According to Rodrik, many nations are stuck with a comparative advantage today that will keep them in poverty for a long time. Nations that grow the most over time exhibit a diversity of products for export and production. However, market failures make it difficult for poorer countries to diversify their economies and gain dynamic comparative advantage. Government policy is needed to help spur the diversification process. Many trade deals choke the ability of nations to deploy the proper policies for long-run development. </p> <p>Developing countries often look at the example of the US and European economies, and more recently, the economies of South Korea and China. Such nations moved into the global marketplace slowly and strategically, protecting their major exporting industries in order to nurture them into world markets. Rodrik shows that nations have trouble doing this under the WTO and an even harder time under deals like Nafta. </p> <p>If economists say these agreements are so bad, why do so many countries sign them? Indeed, most Latin American countries line up to sign trade agreements with the US. A new book, <a href=\"http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/pressAndInformationOffice/publications/books/2008/PoliticalEconomyofHemisphericIntegration.htm\">The Political Economy of Hemispheric Integration: Responding to Globalisation in the Americas</a>, edited by Diego Sanchez Ancochea of Oxford University and Kenneth Shadlen of the London School of Economics, argues that rich countries have the market power to bully Latin Americans into the deals by aligning themselves with Latin American elites and the sectors that receive the short term benefits. It's the politics, stupid.</p> <p>Senator Obama has said that when he is president he will rethink these agreements and make multilateralism the cornerstone of his foreign policy. Senator McCain has <a href=\"http://www.johnmccain.com/Issues/JobsforAmerica/trade.htm\">pledged</a> to follow the Bush administration's fundamentalist fervor for free trade agreements, however small or irrelevant, and is out of touch with contemporary economic thinking.</p> <p>Judging by these recent books from opposing sides of the trade debate, Senator Obama seems to have the economics right.</p>",

An unseen narrator states that climate change can be combated through wind and solar power as well as \"end[ing] our dependence on foreign oil\".</p> <p>Over an image of a young child playing with blocks, the narrator continues: \"So why are we still stuck with dirty and expensive energy? Because big oil spends hundreds of millions of dollars to block clean energy. Lobbyists, ads, even scandals. All to increase their profits, while America suffers.\"</p> <p>An ABC email published <a href=\"http://gristmill.grist.org/story/2008/10/10/91227/394\">on the blog of Grist magazine</a> stated that the advert was rejected due to its split-second shot of the US Capitol building.</p> <p>\"Per our guidelines, national buildings may be used in advertising provided the depictions are incidental to the advertiser's promotion of the product or service,\" the email stated. \"Given the messages and themes of this commercial, the image of the Capital [sic] building is not incidental to this advertising.\"</p> <p>Cathy Zoi, chief executive of the WE campaign, called ABC's decision \"outrageous\" in light of US networks' frequent airing of adverts from Chevron, Exxon Mobil and other oil companies. </p> <p>\"As our country faces deep economic problems, we need to be able to have an honest debate about the root causes of our problem,\" Zoi wrote in an email to supporters of Gore's group on Wednesday.</p> <p>To build publicity for their products, American companies often produce TV adverts with content that pushes the limits of broadcast standards. A Snickers commercial featuring two men embarrassed after sharing a kiss was pulled from the US airwaves last year after complaints from gay-rights groups.</p> <p>But rejection of an advert from a non-profit group is a far more rare occurrence. At the height of the US controversy over same-sex marriage in 2004, CBS and NBC turned down a commercial from the United Church of Christ that touted its acceptance of gay congregants.</p>",

  "<p>Here are some observations by Frank Bruni, to whom the New York Times assigned the task of writing a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/08/us/politics/08assess.html?hp=&amp;pagewanted=print\">front page \"news analysis\"</a> of Tuesday night's presidential debate:</p> <blockquote> <p>McCain tried to play happy warrior - but didn't have much to smile about.</p> <p>Neither candidate was selling morning in America. At times it seemed more like a competition to see who could paint the gloaming in the least unsettling hues.</p> <p>Candidates' voices communicated anger less often than mere frustration. The decibel level was sometimes whispery and the gestures usually muted. There were no exaggerated huffs, no big laughs, no long sighs.</p> <p>\u2026the sort of can-do, feel-good, rah-rah exuberance that candidates sometimes bring to debates was in conspicuously short supply.</p> <p>But during the first hour of the debate, candidates' voices communicated anger less often than mere frustration. The decibel level was sometimes whispery and the gestures usually muted. There were no exaggerated huffs, no big laughs, no long sighs.</p> <p>Despite some odd verbal hiccups during that exchange, Mr Obama spoke more fluidly than Mr McCain, and so calmly that the town-hall format was a largely wasted opportunity. Mr Obama did not use it to communicate any of the spontaneity he has been accused of lacking.</p> <p>Mr McCain, for his part, used the paper in front of him to write so many notes to himself, in such a focused fashion, that he could have passed for a student in a penmanship class.</p> </blockquote> <p>What dear reader, do all of these observations have in common? Well, many things, no doubt, but at least one of these is the fact that none of them makes a damn bit of difference with regard to who should be the next president. You would think that the New York Times had assigned the job of covering one of the three most important political events of the past four years to its food critic, rather than someone versed in the issues that face the next president.</p> <p>Ha ha, you get it. They did. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/ref/dining/bruni-bio.html\">Bruni is the paper's food critic</a>. Of course, once upon a time, he was assigned to cover George Bush - during the 2000 campaign and for Bush's first term as president. And to be honest, judging by his political coverage, you can see why the Times editors thought he'd make a fine food critic. Back in 2000, Bruni's coverage of those presidential debates were just as contentless as the ones he did eight years later. <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502E3DF1E3DF937A35753C1A9669C8B63\">Take a look</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>It was not enough for vice-president Al Gore to venture a crisp pronunciation of Milosevic, as in Slobodan, the Yugoslav president who refuses to be pried from power \u2026 Mr Gore had to go a step further, volunteering the name of Mr Milosevic's challenger, Vojislav Kostunica. Then he had to go a step beyond that, noting that Serbia plus Montenegro equals Yugoslavia\u2026. And as Mr Gore loped effortlessly through the Balkans, barely able to suppress his self-satisfied grin, it became ever clearer that the point of all the thickets of consonants and proper nouns was not a geopolitical lesson\u2026. It was more like oratorical intimidation, an unwavering effort to upstage and unnerve an opponent whose mind and mouth have never behaved in a similarly encyclopaedic fashion.</p> </blockquote> <p>Bruni also felt compelled to note that Gore was \"barely able to suppress his self-satisfied grin\" as if these were the kinds of characteristics upon which voters might be invited to judge their presidential candidates. Meanwhile, in Bruni's view, \"George Bush presented himself 'as the country's best hope for bridging ideological divides, healing partisan wounds and making sure Americans could gaze upon the White House with unfettered respect'.\"</p> <p>Back then, in the lead story in The New York Times following the third and most crucial presidential Bush-Gore debate, readers were forced to wade through 22 full paragraphs before reading a word of substance with regard to either candidate's policy positions. And even here, as veteran journalists Bill Kovach and Tom Rosensteil noted, coverage was cast not in the context of the issues themselves, but strictly in terms of how they \"played\" as political theatre.</p> <p>I don't mean to pick on Mr Bruni. But I do mean to wonder, aloud, why the most important newspaper in the country wants this kind of coverage so badly that they would go back to it even after the 2000 debacle. I mean, it so happens that <a href=\"http://www.pollster.com/blogs/re_debate_reaction_town_hall_d.php\">Obama beat McCain on Tuesday night</a> on style as much as substance, as every single network poll afterward indicated. But what if he hadn't. What if, like Al Gore, he had a few annoying mannerisms but was far better prepared, better tempered, more intelligent, more patient, and more in sync on issue after issue with the nation than his opponent \u2014 as he also happened to be \u2014 and yet his opponent was a better actor? Would that matter?</p> <p>Since when did our most important news organisations decide that the actual issues that face a president are irrelevant to calculations as to who should actually be president? When did these debates become subject to the judgments that are more appropriate to a reality TV show such as American Idol?\" (Sadly, it obviously predates American Idol.)</p> <p>We have seen the danger of judging a president the way we judge a good steak. (\"Plenty of sizzle, not much flavour\u2026\")</p> <p>Turn to the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/08/opinion/08wed1.html\">editorial page of the New York Times</a>, and you can actually find the information you need to understand the key dynamic of the debate:</p> <blockquote> <p>In a way, we should not be surprised that Mr McCain has stooped so low, since the debate showed once again that he has little else to talk about. He long ago abandoned his signature issues of immigration reform and global warming; his talk of \"victory\" in Iraq has little to offer a war-weary nation; and his Reagan-inspired ideology of starving government and shredding regulation lies in tatters on Wall Street.</p> </blockquote> <p>But what's the point of hiding that inside the newspaper? How is that substance is relegated to the opinion pages while the front page \"analysis\" offers little more than the kind of irrelevant diversion from which a serious, respected newspaper is supposed to be the antidote?</p>",
  "<p>Findings from the so-called Troopergate inquiry could represent an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/10/uselections2008-sarahpalin\">October surprise</a> for Sarah Palin, according to an Alaskan Democratic senator, Hollis French, who is running the investigation. </p> <p>It's a complicated tale triggered by a messy family divorce but the main allegation is that Palin dismissed Alaska's public safety commissioner, Walt Monegan, because he refused to fire state trooper Mike Wooten. Wooten is Palin's ex brother-in-law. </p> <p>Palin says Monegan was asked to step down because of his \"outright insubordination\" and \"rogue mentality\". Monegan says he was fired because he refused to submit to pressure, from Palin's husband, Todd, and other aides, to sack Wooten.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/10/AR2008101000254.html\">Washington Post</a> says the 14-member legislative panel that has conducted the inquiry could recommend that the case be closed, that another committee continues to investigate, or that the matter be referred to criminal investigators. </p> <p>Monegan tells the paper he has not seen the report and does not know what to expect.</p> <blockquote> <p>I just hope that the truth is figured out. That the governor did want me to fire him [Wooten], and I chose to not. You just can't walk up to someone and say, \"I fire you.\" He didn't do anything under my watch to result in termination.</p> </blockquote> <p>According to the Post, the report will also focus on Todd Palin, who had \"extraordinary access\" to the governor's office and her top aides. </p> <blockquote> <p>Todd acknowledges calling and meeting over the course of many months with numerous senior government officials about Wooten, whom he described as a dangerous and unstable man who had threatened his family.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the New York Times, there's a lengthy account of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/10/us/10trooper.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=safety%20bear&amp;st=cse&amp;oref=slogin\">the kind of pressure</a> Monegan is alleged to have come under. </p> <p>On one occasion, a senior official is said to have phoned Monegan saying Palin was going to the 2007 state fair and did not want to see Wooten there. Wooten had volunteered for duty at the fairgrounds - in full costume as <a href=\"http://www.dps.state.ak.us/ast/safetybear.aspx\">Safety Bear</a>, the troopers' child-friendly mascot.</p> <p>\"I thought to myself, 'Man, do they have a heavy-duty network and focus on this guy',\" Monegan said. \"You'd call that an obsession.\"</p> <p>The Times says interviews and documents show the governor, her husband and seven administration officials contacted the commissioner and his aides about Wooten three dozen times over 19 months.</p> <p>Wooten also recalls a conversation with Sarah Palin in which she told him that Wooten was \"not the kind of person we should want as a trooper\". He told the governor that there was no new evidence to pursue.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.adn.com/news/alaska/story/550229.html\">Anchorage Daily News</a> examines the 25-page statement Todd Palin submitted to the investigation. Palin is unapologetic about his efforts to get Wooten fired, but he says he doesn't think those efforts had anything to do with Monegan's dismissal.</p> <p>\"I have heard criticism that I am too involved in my wife's administration,\" Todd Palin wrote in his statement. \"My wife and I are very close. We are each other's best friend. I have helped her in her career the best I can, and she has helped me.\"</p> <p>\"Todd Palin's statements may help provide the governor some degree of cover in the probe,\" says <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/10/09/politics/main4511568.shtml\">CBSNews.com's senior political editor, Vaughn Ververs</a>, \"but the level of his involvement here will probably raise even more questions and this continues to be a political distraction to the McCain campaign.\"</p> <p>The estimated 300-page report and 1,000 or more pages of supporting documents produced by the investigation are due to be released later today.</p>",

  "<h2>Slumps and slurs</h2> <p>As the Dow Jones index plunged, the candidates continued to focus relentlessly on the economy. John McCain pushed his retooled mortgage buy-up plan, while Barack Obama mocked it and called on the US treasury to implement the bailout agreed last week \"as quickly as possible\". But yesterday was also the day that a subtext of the recent campaign - the increasingly ugly tone of supporters at Republican rallies - became something more than a subtext.</p> <p>McCain and his running-mate, Sarah Palin, continue to raise questions about the extent of Barack Obama's associations with the Weather Underground co-founder Bill Ayers, because they know it's \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/09/uselections2008.johnmccain4\"> logically impossible to prove a negative</a>,\" Daniel Nasaw writes on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com\">theguardian.com</a>. But some supporters are going further. In recent days, audience-members at McCain/Palin events have shouted \"treason!\" and \"terrorist!\" about Obama, and \"kill him!\" about either Obama or Ayers. One reportedly used a racial epithet at a black TV sound engineer, and told him to \"sit down, boy\". <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/oct/09/uselections2008.barackobama1\">Videos circulating on the internet</a> yesterday showed other rally attendees speaking about Obama's \"terrorist connections\". Rally warm-up speakers have referred to \"Barack Hussein Obama\" at least twice.</p> <p>In a statement, the McCain campaign sought to distance itself from what it calls \"inappropriate rhetoric\", but for the first time the Republican National Committee will today launch ads in Indiana and Wisconsin that mention Ayers's name. And in Wisconsin yesterday, when one man took to the microphone to <a href=\"http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/10/mccain_supporter_rants_about_h.php\">call the Democratic contender a hooligan and a socialist</a>, McCain replied: \"The gentleman is right.\" The race, it seems, may get much dirtier yet.</p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>Obama is in Ohio, McCain is in Wisconsin and Minnesota. Today also marks the conclusion of the Troopergate investigation, which could see Sarah Palin censured for abuse of power in the firing of the head of the Alaskan police, allegedly because he refused to become involved in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/10/uselections2008-sarahpalin\">a family feud involving her brother-in-law</a>, a state trooper. Palin has said she had other reasons for dismissing the police chief. </p> <p>Palin emerges from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/10/uselections2008-sarahpalin1\">Ian Cobain's mega-profile</a> in today's Guardian as a rentlessly ambitious climber whose bid for the mayoralty of Wasilla was conducted with an eye to the presidency of the United States. \"She's really pretty insecure,\" her mayoral campaign manager says. \"I was with her before she gave a speech to the people from BP in Anchorage when she was running for governor, and she was terrified. There are real fears there. But every time she goes out and persuades people to like her, it lifts her, it makes her feel better about herself ... She's a brilliant politician, but it's all about getting more and more people to love her.\"</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>One day of post-debate data did little to change the major tracking polls. In Gallup's, for example, the candidates remained in exactly the same position as yesterday \u2014 Obama on 52% and McCain on 41%. Obama continues to surprise in battleground states. In one new poll he leads McCain 51% to 43% in Virginia, a state which hasn't gone Democratic in a presidential election since 1964.</p> <h2>On theguardian.com now</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/oct/09/sarahpalin-republicans\">Tomasky talk: Troopergate won't implicate Palin</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/10/barack-obama-tv-ad\">Obama buys 30-minute TV ad</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/oct/10/uselections2008\">Younge America video: 'Race relations ... are abominable'</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/09/afghanistan.johnmccain\">Simon Tisdall: Fighting talk is self-defeating</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/oct/09/uselections2008.barackobama\">Ed Pilkington: McCain has the look of a loser</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/deadlineusa/2008/oct/10/uselections2008-useconomy\">Deadline USA: a housing crisis tour of Riverside</a></p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/10/debate-may-have-helped-obama.html\">FiveThirtyEight.com: Debate may have helped Obama</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1008/14444.html\">Politico: Hispanics turn cold shoulder to McCain</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/09/AR2008100902331.html?hpid=opinionsbox1\">EJ Dionne, Washington Post: Obama v McCain is FDR v Hoover</a></p> <h2>Quote of the day</h2> <p>Joe Biden has been off the trail due to the death of his mother-in-law, but yesterday he was back, and cracking wise: \"Sarah Palin says, you know, 'I was in second grade when Joe Biden was elected to the United States senate'.

  "<p>In all the shouting about who's to blame for the financial meltdown \u2013 Hank Paulson, derivatives traders, fat cat CEOs, John McCain (if you're Barack Obama), Obama (if you're McCain) \u2013 we are not hearing a single thing about the Rolling Stones.</p> <p>So they're a rock band. They are not solely or even primarily culpable. But they are involved. When the Stones <a href=\"http://www.allbusiness.com/marketing-advertising/4154824-1.html\">accepted sponsorship for their 2005 US tour from AmeriQuest</a>, one of the country's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ameriquest_Mortgage\">largest sub-prime mortgage lenders</a>, they joined the effort that moved millions of people toward financial and personal ruin, a disaster underlying the ongoing national/global/intergalactic credit crisis. Among their slogans: \"AmeriQuest: Not your average mortgage company. Rolling Stones? Not your average garage band.\" </p> <p>That AmeriQuest wasn't the average mortgage company is demonstrably true (unlike so much of what was said to its hopeful borrowers): AmeriQuest was far more unethical and loathsome than the average mortgage company. Mick Jagger has of course been caught in bed with scores of headline-worthy companions, but AmeriQuest has to have been the least attractive. Sympathy for the Devil? How about deals with the Devil? When the Stones accepted AmeriQuest's sponsorship, in May 2005, the lending company was already under investigation from coast to coast for fraud and unfair business practices that had devastated countless lives. In August that year it <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2005/07/29/ameriquest_sets_aside_325m_for_settlement/\">agreed to pay $325m to settle an investigation</a> by a task force of attorney generals, on top of previous multimillion-dollar settlements. </p> <p>We should have known we were heading into the end days. The street fighting men taking money from <em>them</em>? That deal placed the Stones, those former icons of the counterculture, in the same category as any Wall Street or government big shot whose ambition was enrichment at the expense of people with far less - in the band's case, its own fans. The stage, television and internet promotions, which didn't mention AmeriQuest's sub-prime status, <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2005/oct/31/business/fi-ameriquest31\">aimed to familiarise Rolling Stones fans with the company's name</a> so that they responded to direct mailings. \"The 'open rate' goes sky high when you put the Stones logo on the envelope,\" said Kevin Morefield, then the company's executive vice-president for strategic planning. </p> <p>The Stones potentially gave AmeriQuest access to millions more borrowers. \"In today's saturated marketplace,\" Brian Woods, the company's CMO, <a href=\"http://www.rollingstones.com/news/press.php?uid=275\">said at the time</a>, \"the Rolling Stones break through the clutter to reach fans in a way that few iconic brands can. \u2026 [T]his tour allows AmeriQuest the opportunity to reach those fans by fulfilling their dream to see the Stones on stage live.\" AmeriQuest was big on dreams. It styled itself the \"proud sponsor of the American dream\" when what was needed was a sponsor of American reality.</p> <p>It wasn't just about the mortgages. Any big-name concert draws fans into a financial dream world. A couple of tickets for $250 each, another hundred and a half on irresistible logo swag (sweatshirts, hats, pirate paraphernalia, whatever), plus dinner, transport and babysitting, and Stones fans in 2005 might have been in for a grand \u2013 enough to have a picket fence erected around the house they would soon buy with a sub-prime loan. </p> <p>AmeriQuest dished out the most valuable Stones tickets to powerful recipients whose sympathies the company sought. That included politicians such as <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/08/11/MNGVCE66GH1.DTL\">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bloggingstocks.com/2007/12/31/does-ameriquests-campaign-cash-tie-bush-to-the-subprime-mortgag/\">legislators</a> in at least seven states \u2013 part of the sub-prime industry's lobbying for laxer laws to facilitate ever more predatory loan practices. The Rolling Stones were not the only ones who sold themselves to this cause. AmeriQuest also sponsored professional baseball and football, car racing and Paul McCartney (his 2005 SuperBowl performance), and was a major cash donor to both Democrats and (more so) Republicans. Former employees have given sworn testimonies relating to AmeriQuest's tactics and methods with the less privileged \u2013 their customers \u2013 which included concealing interest-rate terms and fees, forging documents and fabricating incomes. The hundreds of millions the company paid out in settlements pales in comparison to its profits. </p> <p>AmeriQuest's mortgage services were shut down when it was acquired by Citigroup in 2007. It leaves a nation ravaged by short sales, foreclosures and worthless mortgage-backed investments, along with crowds of desolate Stones fans (among plenty of others) who thought they owned a home. Hey, you can't always get what you want. They're back in low-end rentals or crashing on sofas, the radios still crackling with Jagger's prescient lyrics: \"Please allow me to introduce myself, I'm a man of wealth and taste, I've been around for a long, long year, Stole many a man's soul and faith. \u2026 Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name.\"</p>",

With climate change, globalization, and overpopulation, he argues, the central challenge to humanity has now become \"to manage what is already unavoidable and avoid what will truly be unmanageable.\"</p> <p>In an exclusive interview for Yale Environment 360, Friedman spoke with New Yorker staff writer Elizabeth Kolbert about the need for an energy technology revolution \u2014 a revolution he believes should be led by the United States. The three-time Pulitzer Prize winner told Kolbert that energy technology must be the next great global industry and that \"the country that leads that industry is going to have the most national security, economic security, innovative companies and global respect.\"</p> <p>During the 40-minute interview, Friedman talked about everything from Washington and China to E.O. Wilson and Barack Obama, and he dismissed calls for the U.S. to develop more fossil fuels (\"drill, baby, drill\") by noting, \"There's only one mantra for America, and that's 'Innovate, baby, innovate.'\"</p> <p>Friedman spoke with Kolbert from his office in Washington, D.C.</p> <p><strong>Elizabeth Kolbert</strong>: You've written extensively both about global terrorism and global warming, and you talk in the book about the difference in the American response to these both very, very scary problems. Why do think there is such a big difference? Why the war on terror and sort of a shrug on global warming?</p> <p><strong>Thomas Friedman</strong>: I guess it's a couple things. One is that the war on terror could be personified in the face and person of Osama Bin Laden or the 9/11 hijackers, and I think that's very important for getting people focused on a threat. It could be manifested in immediacy, literally, in the downing of the Twin Towers and the attack on the Pentagon. There was a clear and present danger people felt.</p> <p>Thomas Friedman: \"It's unlike any challenge I think we've ever seen.\"<br>Now I'll just contrast that with climate change. The enemy is a gas called carbon dioxide that you can't see, touch or smell. So there's no personification basically. The effects at the moment tend to be diffuse and hard to see, unless you normally travel through the Arctic Circle during summer.</p> <p>And finally, the biggest impacts, as we understand them, will fall on people who haven't been born yet. And getting people, our generation, to take decisive action on a kind of 9/11 scale in response to a problem you can't see, touch or smell, that will impact most profoundly on people who haven't been born yet, is a real challenge in stewardship.</p> <p>And it's unlike any challenge I think we've ever seen.</p> <p>Kolbert: As you point out, global warming is a really, really hard issue and, as we just talked about, a multigenerational issue that requires really smart, focused leadership over the course of many years.</p> <p>Friedman: That's right.</p> <p>Kolbert: Don't these two facts sort of point you to the reaction that Dave Letterman gave you the other night, when he just sort of blurted out, \"We are so screwed?\"</p> <p>Friedman: Right. This book in many ways \u2014 what I tell people when I speak about it now to audiences \u2014 is that it masquerades as a book about energy and the environment. But it's really just a masquerade. It's really a book about America.</p> <p>And energy/environment is almost like an allegory I use to talk about our ability anymore to face a big, multigenerational problem in a serious, fixed, focused and sustained way... One of the challenges, and I don't have to tell you this, is that if you tell people, \"We're just completely toast, we're fried, we're cooked.\" They say, \"Well, if that's the case, let's party.\" And if you say, \"No, no, no, no, no. No, we can actually do this. If we get our act together, we can do this.\" And they say, \"Oh, we can do this? Well, let's party.\"</p> <p>So the problem is, either way people want to just party, and finding that kind of happy medium where people understand the immediacy and seriousness of starting now, and at the same time aren't paralyzed by the enormity of the task.</p> <p>That's why I end the book, I love Donella Meadows' line, \"We have exactly enough time, starting now.\" You know?</p> <p>Kolbert: Yeah, that's a great line.</p> <p>Friedman: I kind of live by that mantra. Because I always tell people, pessimists are usually right. Let's face it. Optimists are usually wrong. But all the great change in history, positive change, was done by optimists.</p> <p>So what I've really tried to do in my own politics and in this book is really two things: One, is basically to say, well, if the world is getting hot, flat and crowded, what does that mean? It means that these five big problems are the next big problems of the 21st century \u2014 energy, natural resources supply and demand, petro-dictatorship, climate change, biodiversity loss, and energy poverty. What does that list mean? That means the next great global industry has to be \u2014 energy technology. The production of abundant, cheap, clean reliable electrons through a combination of innovation, energy efficiency, and conservation.</p> <p>Well, if that's the next great global industry, then it means that the country that leads that industry is going to have the most national security, economic security, innovative companies, and I think global respect. And my point is, simply, that country has to be the United States of America.</p> <p>Kolbert: You talk in the book about how crucial it is to put the right regulatory policies in place, to encourage the development of clean energy sources. But you always hear, and I'm sure you always hear it when you go out into the U.S., that anything that we do, that China, say, isn't doing, puts us at a competitive disadvantage. So how do you answer those folks?</p> <p>Friedman: Well I answer that really with a story I tell in the book. Last year, I was invited to the China Clean Car Conference. China has a clean car conference \u2014 who knew? \u2014 in Tianjin, China, their kind-of Detroit, kind of a rather grimy city, the Marriott Tianjin.</p> <p>And, I was the closing speaker. The audience was all Chinese car guys. All kind of grizzled Chinese car guys, all listening to me \u2014 nobody spoke English, they were all listening on headsets through an interpreter. And I thought, \"What do I tell these guys?\" And so, my basic message was this: \"Guys,\" \u2014 it was only guys \u2014 \"guys, I have got to tell you, every time I come to China young Chinese say to me, 'Mr. Friedman, you guys got to grow dirty for 150 years. Now it's our turn.' And my message to you, on behalf of all Americans, is to tell you, 'You're right. It's your turn.</p> <p>All the great change in history, positive change, was done by optimists.\"</p> <p>Grow as dirty as you want.' Because I think we just need about five years now to invent all the clean-power technologies you're going to need as you choke to death, and we're going to come over, and we're going to sell them all to you. And we're going to clean your clock. I don't know how you say that in Chinese, we're going to clean your clock in the next great global industry. So, please, if you want to give me a five-year lead, I'd love five. I'd prefer 10. Take your time. Because we are going to clean your clock in the next great global industry.\"</p> <p>Now it takes about 30 seconds for the translation to get through \u2014 and that's when you see everyone adjusting their headsets, eyes lighting up \u2014 and then about one second for them to understand exactly what I'm saying: That they basically have a choice. They can do what they did on telephony, which was to go from no phones to cellphones, and skip landlines, and they can do that in clean power\u2026 But unless they really change, they're going to miss the new IT, which is ET.</p> <p>And so they can sit back and say, \"This is unfair. You guys ate the hors d'oeuvres, you ate the entr\u00e9e, and you invite us for dessert and ask us to split the bill. We're not going to do that.\" And I understand, I say, \"I know why you're pissed. I'd be pissed, too. But I'm here to tell you, this is the next great global industry in a world that's hot, flat and crowded, it has to be.\"</p> <p>Kolbert: Now, have you delivered that to an American audience? What kind of response do you get?</p> <p>Friedman: They all kind of get it. But I just tell you, parenthetically, it's been amazing... I had 8,000 people come to hear me at Miami of Ohio, in the basketball stadium, 4,200 in Purdue, 3,000 at Ohio State. I've had crowds I never had before. I'd like to think it's about me. It's not. And this is not false modesty. People are desperate for someone to point them out and forward in a way. And they're just so hungry\u2026 But they also want to know, \"What can I do?\"</p> <p>Kolbert: You have an interesting passage in the book, where you talk about how in a campaign, a candidate might frame an energy tax, I think you talk about a gasoline tax. Can you talk about that?</p> <p>Friedman: Politicians will always say, \"If I do this, my opponent will hit me on taxes.\" And I say, well, let's just think about this. Let's imagine I'm the pro-green candidate, and Elizabeth Kolbert is the pro-nontax candidate. And I come out and I say I'm for a gasoline tax and you say, \"There goes my opponent, Mr. Friedman.\" Just like Sarah Palin you would say, \"He's never seen a tax he didn't like. And now he wants to come to Wassila, Alaska, and tax your gasoline?\"</p> <p>I'd say, \"Let's get one thing straight. My opponent and I, we're both for a tax. Because if you don't think what OPEC oil cartel is doing to the real price of oil isn't an artificial price, isn't in effect a tax, then you're not paying attention. So we're both for a tax. I'd just prefer my taxes go to the U.S. Treasury to fund U.S. schools, U.S. roads, U.S. highways, U.S. research, U.S. innovation. It's just a little tic I have, that I like my tax dollars to build my country, not Saudi Arabia, Iran, or Kuwait, or Abu Dhabi, or Dubai, or Russia or Venezuela\u2026 My opponent is indifferent where your tax dollars go.\" If you can't win that debate, you don't belong in politics.</p> <p>Kolbert: Right, but of course if we look at what we've actually seen over the last few months, it's \"Drill, baby, drill.\"</p> <p>Friedman: Absolutely. And that, as I've written and been saying, that is just so stupid. I mean, it is as if on the eve of the IT revolution, on the eve of the birth of the Internet and the PC, we are out there pounding the table for more IBM Selectric typewriters. Carbon paper, baby, carbon paper! That's nuts. There's only one mantra for America, and that's \"Innovate, baby, innovate!\"</p> <p>Kolbert: You had a column the other day which I thought skirted pretty close to an endorsement there.</p> <p>Friedman: Yes\u2026 you noticed!</p> <p>Kolbert: But do you actually like Barack Obama's energy plan or is it just better than \"Drill, baby, drill?\"</p> <p>Friedman: I think it's just, right now, better than \"Drill, baby, drill.\" I give Obama credit for generally leaning in favor of all the right things. And not falling off the wagon on things like \"Drill, baby, drill\" or on lifting the federal gasoline tax in the summer. And he did vote in favor three times for the renewable energy and production investment tax credits.</p> <p>McCain missed all eight votes. He came out for lifting the gasoline tax in the summer, which was just a stunt that would have simply added more driving, more CO2 to the atmosphere, and pushed up the price of oil. And then he came up with \"Drill, baby, drill.\"</p> <p>So, to me, basically there's a clear, clear choice. Now there's only one green candidate. It is Barack Obama.</p> <p> If you don't have an ethic of conservation, you basically have a license to drive a Hummer through the Amazon.\"</p> <p>Would I like Obama to make the things I'm passionate about more central to his identity and his campaign, rather just another spoke in the wheel? There's health care, there's green technology, there's new roads, there's education, there's Iraq. Yes, to me, it's the center. It's not another spoke. But, you have to ride whatever horse you got. And right now he's all we got. And he's a lot better than the other guy. And so I ride.</p> <p>Kolbert: Can you talk about the media's role in all this. I mean, what do you think of the job that we all have done?</p> <p>Friedman: You know, it's such a hard issue. I'm a big believer, to name something is to own it. And if you can name an issue, you can own an issue: \"The World is Flat.\" And that's why I spend a lot of time naming things. And trying to find ways to convey enormous complexity in a very simple way. And one of the things, and I've said this before, that's always struck me about the green movement, is that it was actually named by its opponents. They own the definition... Because they named it liberal, tree-hugging, sissy, girly-man, unpatriotic, vaguely French.</p> <p>And the whole purpose of my book is to redefine green. To redefine it as a geo-political, geo-strategic, geo-economic, patriotic. Green is the new red, white and blue.</p> <p>Kolbert: But as you also discuss, there's a real reason to be afraid that even unlimited clean energy is not going to save the planet, in fact quite possibly it would just accelerate biodiversity.</p> <p>Friedman: Well, bless your heart\u2026 You're one of the few people who've picked up on that. You know.</p> <p>Nobody gets the conservation part of the triad \u2014 that if you don't have an ethic of conservation, you basically have a license to drive a Hummer through the Amazon.</p> <p>I tell you, it goes back to your Barack Obama question. Why am I still hanging in there with him? Because I believe, once elected, he has the potential \u2014 the potential \u2014 to really be a transformational figure on this issue, if he wants to be\u2026 The president of the United States' bully pulpit is unlike any other in the world. And what we have lost sight of, because we've forgotten what it would be like to have a president who \u2014 unlike the current one who cannot choke the word c-c-c-c-c-conservation out of his mouth \u2014 what it would be like to have a president who on inauguration day gives his inaugural speech and then hops on a bicycle, and bikes to the White House.</p> <p>Kolbert: That's a great idea.</p> <p>Friedman: And that's what I'm going to propose, if this guy wins. You and Michelle ride your bike from the Capitol steps to the White House. Do you know what happens the next day? A hundred thousand bicycles are sold in America. The people forget the symbolic and rhetorical power of the president of the United States\u2026 We've forgotten, you know, because we've had this troll who comes out once a week now and tells us the economy's OK. And Dick Cheney, when was the last time you ever heard him speak to anybody? I mean, who would know?</p> <p>Kolbert: You talk to an amazing array of very smart people, the people we would all like to talk to, from John Holdren to E. O Wilson. If you had to pick, and maybe this is unfair, but something that someone said to you that really got you thinking about things in a new way, and that you'd point people towards, what would that be?</p> <p>Friedman: You know, you mention E.O. Wilson, and Ed Wilson is just one of the great treasures of America. And he said something that really struck me. And I'm not going to get it exactly right, but he basically said,</p> <p> We're only going to innovate our way out of this problem. This is not a problem for regulators, it's for engineers.\"</p> <p>\"Nature is regulating our climate for free. Mother Nature, she's been doing that for free, for a long, long time. Now do you really want to get in there and do geo-engineering and all this kind of stuff? Well, if you don't want to do that, then we need to get out of Mother Nature's way. Because do you want to be turning the dials and pulling the levers and think we can do that better than Mother Nature?\" I don't think so. And it is a very, very powerful point.</p> <p>Kolbert: One of the themes of the book and explicit messages of the book obviously is the importance of making advances in clean-energy technologies, so you write, and I quote, \"Incremental breakthroughs are all we've had, but exponential is what we desperately need.\"</p> <p>Friedman: Yes.</p> <p>Kolbert: Can you just talk a little bit about what you mean by that?</p> <p>Friedman: I went to Bali last year\u2026 It really was an epiphany for me, because I just sort of looked around, I looked at the process and I said the following to myself: We're not going to regulate our way out of this problem. We're only going to innovate our way out of this problem. This is not a problem for regulators, it's for engineers. Because, my attitude basically is that I'm not against Bali, and Kyoto - if you can get 190 countries all to agree and implement verifiable reductions and limits on their CO2 emissions, may God bless you and keep you. But I don't want to hostage my future and my kids' future to that necessity.</p> <p>And so I'm trying to change the model here. I'm trying to say, let's make America the leader, the country that demonstrably grows richer, more innovative, more energy secure, more economically secure, more nationally secure, and more respected, by taking the lead in the green revolution. I am absolutely convinced more people will follow us, by emulation, than will ever do under Kyoto, what we expect them to do by compulsion.</p> <p>Kolbert: But you also write, and you know that real energy innovation is hard.</p> <p>Friedman: That's right. Our nose is pressed right now against the boundaries of physics, and chemistry and biology. And that's why so much of what we need to do is just push out that boundary. Because only in the arbitrage between all those disciplines will we find, I think, the real breakthrough.</p> <p>Kolbert: But what makes you think that breakthrough is out there?</p> <p>Friedman: I do. I really do. Here's the upside of the book tour I've been on. Every stop I come home with a pocketful of business cards. Because all these people come up to me with their energy companies that they started \u2014 solar, wind, cellulosic. \"I've got a duck that paddles a wheel, blows up a balloon, the balloon issues methane, burns fuel, turns a turbine\u2026\" You hear the craziest stuff, but everyone's trying. And so I'm a big believer in the wisdom of crowds here.</p> <p>Kolbert: You had another great fact in the book, which I did not know, which was that green was the single-most trademarked term in 2007, and you go on to point out that a lot of the ways in which green is used is [the idea that] green should be easy. But the fact of the matter is there is no easy way to be green. I mean, if it's easy, it's not green.</p> <p>Friedman: That's right.</p> <p>Kolbert: I though that was a very good point. Of course people, as you point out, we don't like hard things. That, I suppose, is the $64 trillion question\u2026 But can green be sold as something hard? Can it be sold politically with the acknowledgement that it's hard?</p> <p>Friedman: The way I try to sell it is that it's something big, it's aspirational, it's about national security. That it's not just about electric power, it's about national power.</p> <p>Kolbert: You had a column the other day titled \"Green the Bailout.\" What do you mean by that?</p> <p>Friedman: Well, from \"The World is Flat,\" one of the things I was keenly aware of is the importance of bubbles. It was actually the railroad bubble back in the 19th century that all these people went in, bought railroad stocks, and built railroads \u2014 most of them actually lost money. But what they left behind was the national railroad system.</p> <p>The dot.com boom bubble bust \u2014 you know, people went out, bought dot.coms, most people lost money, some people made money, but what they left behind was a national Internet bandwidth highway. And unfortunately now we're going through a financial system or industry bubble \u2014 and what it's leaving behind is</p> <p> People are desperate for someone to point them out and forward in a way. And they're just so hungry.\"</p> <p>bunch of dead derivatives, empty condos in Florida, and Gulf Stream jets that the mega-rich can't afford anymore. It will be a tragedy, and what makes it even worse, we borrowed a lot of it from China, and we didn't borrow \u2014 we put it on our kids' Visa cards. And so if we're going to do this mega-bailout we have got to make sure we are laying the foundations with it of another great industrial revolution.</p> <p>Kolbert: Here's my last question. In the process of writing the book, did you become more or less hopeful about the prospects for a world that's hot, flat and crowded.</p> <p>Friedman: I'm from Minnesota. I'm optimistic. I mean, that's just who I am.</p> <p>Kolbert: Yeah, you call yourself a sober optimist.</p> <p>Friedman: Right. But I'm more sober, you know, but I am still an optimist. I've had the opportunity to talk to Bill Gates a lot about this and the previous book. And Bill's kind of, I would say, an innovation determinist. He believes innovation can, will and must solve every problem. And maybe I'm not quite there yet, but I lean on his side of the debate than the other side. And as long as I have breath issuing forth from this body, yeah, that's where I'm going to put my time and energy.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was shared by <a href=\"http://e360.yale.edu\">Yale Environment 360</a>, a member of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/network\">Guardian Environment Network</a></p>",
  "<p>Derek Simpson, the joint general secretary of the country's biggest trade union, is being forced to stand down and seek re-election because of union rules on staying in office beyond the age of 65.</p> <p>The development has sparked fears that Unite - the 1.7 million-member union - will be thrown into disarray at a time when millions of workers face redundancies in the wake of the credit crunch.</p> <p>Simpson was facing a legal challenge from a potential rival who claimed that he had broken union rules because he was seeking to stay in office beyond the age of 65 without standing for re-election. </p> <p>But an emergency meeting of the union's executive voted yesterday to suspend the union's rule book to enable the 64-year-old to resign his post and seek re-election by the Amicus section of the union.</p> <p>The decision suggests the union believed it was about to lose a case before David Cockburn, the certification officer, which would have forced Simpson to quit.</p> <p>The challenge was brought by Jerry Hicks, a former Rolls-Royce union convenor, who intends to seek nominations to challenge Simpson. His challenge was a carbon copy of the one Simpson made to force the former Amalgamated Engineering union leader, Sir Ken Jackson, to stand down. Simpson stood in the subsequent election and won.</p> <p>Hicks was delighted with the decision yesterday. \"This is a victory for democracy,\" he said.</p> <p>The union said in a statement: \"The election has been agreed in order to safeguard the provision, as set out in the general rules and instrument of amalgamation of Unite, for the continuation of the general secretary of the Amicus section in office as a Unite joint general secretary until December 2010.''</p> <p>Nominations for the new joint secretary must be in by December and the election will take place in the new year.</p> <p>Laurence Faircloth, the union's south-west regional secretary, announced that he also intended to seek nominations to stand.</p> <p>The merger of Amicus and the Transport and General Workers' Union is yet to function properly, as both general secretaries, Simpson and Tony Woodley, who do not appear to get on yet, jointly run the union.</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/finland\">Finland</a>'s ex-president Martti Ahtisaari has won the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nobelpeaceprize\">Nobel peace prize</a>, the Norwegian Nobel committee announced today.</p> <p>He was awarded the prize for his important efforts, on several continents and over more than three decades, to resolve international conflicts.</p> <p>\"These efforts have contributed to a more peaceful world and to 'fraternity between nations' in Alfred Nobel's spirit,\" the committee said in announcing the prize.</p> <p>His name had been mentioned in speculation leading up to the prize for his work in Europe and Asia.</p> <p>There had also been speculation that the winner could be the more controversial figure of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/24/nobelpeaceprize.hujia\">Hu Jia</a>, a Chinese dissident, to highlight China's human rights record. But in selecting Ahtisaari for the prize, the committee has chosen a safer recipient who is responsible for more traditional peace work.</p> <p>Awarding the Nobel peace prize to Ahtisaari could help end the war in Iraq, the chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee said today. <br> \"I think the Nobel Peace Prize can bring about a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Iraq. I am sure it can facilitate the work Ahtisaari is doing there,\" Ole Danbolt Mjoes told theguardian.com, referring to an ongoing initiative by the former Finnish leader.  Since 2007 Ahtisaari's organisation Crisis Management Initiative has mediated two secret meetings in Finland between Iraqi Shia Muslim and Sunni Arab groups to try to bring peace in the Middle Eastern country. \"Ahtisaari managed to get 36 senior Iraqis to Helsinki in April 2008, and is now working on a next meeting in Baghdad. I think it's rather promising,\" said Mjoes. Mjoes said the prize could help with finances and influence. \"If some of the money [\u00a3820,000] goes to that initiative, then it will help,\" he said. And \"when he will go into these meetings, he will go there as Nobel peace prize laureate. His prestige will go up and his words [will carry more weight]\".  \"We saw that most with Shirin Ebadi [who won in 2003] and Wangari Maathai [who won in 2004]. When they got the peace prize, suddenly they got a huge platform compared with before.\" He praised Ahtisaari's efforts at resolving conflicts. \"He is one of the most forward-looking of peace makers. He never gives up and he always tries to find a solution despite the difficulties. The world needs more men like him.\" We wanted to focus on successful peace mediators because this world needs peace mediators.\" But Mjoes conceded that mediation alone cannot bring peace. \"Nothing can happen if the parties involved in the conflict don't want to take part in the process.\"</p> <p>Reporters also asked the committee whether Ahtisaari's award meant their members saw the need for conflict resolution to be used in countries such as Iraq, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka.</p> <p>Professor Geir Lundestad, the committee's secretary, said: \"We are not pointing at specific countries. It has to come naturally. \"Mediation can only work if the parties have an interest in solving the question.\"</p> <p>Ahtisaari's efforts in Africa, Europe, Asia and the Middle East drew much praise from the five-member committee.</p> <p>\"For the past 20 years, he has figured prominently in endeavours to resolve several serious and long-lasting conflicts,\" the citation said, mentioning his work in conflicts from Namibia and Aceh to Kosovo and Iraq.</p> <p>\"He has also made constructive contributions to the resolution of conflicts in Northern Ireland, in Central Asia, and on the Horn of Africa,\" the citation said.</p> <p>Speaking to NRK Norwegian TV, Ahtisaari said he \"was very pleased and grateful\" at receiving the prize.</p> <p>Asked what he considered his greatest achievement, he spoke of peace talks in Namibia in 1989 and 1990, which the committee said \"played a significant part in the establishment of Namibia's independence\".</p> <p>Ahtisaari, 71, began his working life as a primary school teacher before joining Finland's foreign ministry in 1965. He spent 20 years abroad, first as ambassador to Tanzania and then to the United Nations in New York.</p> <p>He was UN undersecretary of state for administration and management from 1987 to 1991, heading the UN operation that brought independence to Namibia in 1990.</p> <p>In 2007, Ahtisaari's office - Crisis Management Initiative - started secret meetings in Finland between Iraqi Sunni and Shia groups to agree on a road map to peace.</p> <p>He told NRK he hoped that winning the prize would make it easier to raise more money for his initiative.</p> <p>The talks, based on the format of peacemaking efforts in South Africa and Northern Ireland, included 16 delegates from the feuding groups.</p> <p>They \"agreed to consult further\" on a list of recommendations to begin reconciliation talks, including resolving political disputes through non-violence and democracy.</p> <p>In August 2005, Ahtisaari helped end 30 years of fighting between Aceh rebels and the Indonesian government through peace talks in Finland, which he initiated and mediated with Crisis Management Initiative.</p> <p>A peace agreement, signed in Helsinki, followed seven months of negotiations between the two parties, which he initiated and mediated.</p> <p>Ahtisaari was also chairman of the Bosnia-Herzegovina working group in the international peace conference on former Yugoslavia from 1992 to 1993, and was special adviser to the UN secretary general on the former Yugoslavia in 1993.</p> <p>The prize is announced in October each year, and the award ceremony takes place in December in Oslo. Last year's winners were Al Gore and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.</p>",

  "<p> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevglobal/2928313622/\">Foreclosed home in Riverside</a> by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevglobal/\">Kevin Anderson</a>, <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/deed.en\">Some Rights Reserved</a></p> <p>Ralph Torres gave me a tour or his working class neighbourhood in Riverside California today. His father was in the real estate business for more than 30 years, and he and his family have seen their share of downturns but nothing like this.</p> <p>Ralph e-mailed me after reading <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/deadlineusa/2008/oct/04/uselections2008.useconomy\">my last post about the housing crisis</a> in California to describe how it is playing out in his community of Riverside.</p> <p>\"Our family went through a few recessions over the years, but it was always real estate sales slowing down. You didn't have block after block with three or four houses vacant due to foreclosures,\" he said.</p> <p>He said he could turn down almost any street in his neighbourhood and find foreclosed homes. \"To see the empty houses, it shakes you up. It's like nothing that we've seen before,\" he said.</p> <p>His father, who died earlier this year, was in the real estate business from 1964 to 1998 and has left his family with six single-family rental homes and a commercial property.</p> <p>The houses in Ralph's neighbourhood were built in the mid-1950s. It was a predominantly an African-American neighbourhood then, but in the last 10 to 15 years, Mexican-Americans have moved in, becoming the dominant group in the area.</p> <p>He lives in a house that his father bought in 1969 for $16,000. They refurbished the house shortly before the peak of the housing boom a couple of years ago, and his father intended to sell it, pricing it for $290,000. That was in line with prices in the neighbourhood then. But when the market started dropping, they decided to keep the house. Now, houses in the neighbourhood are worth half what they were during the height of the bubble, prices not seen since the late 1990s.</p> <p>\"We were drunk on the boom. You knew it was going to crash,\" he said, but he wasn't prepared for this.</p> <p>Five months ago, he watched the family across the street struggle to keep their home only to lose it. As we drove around his neighbourhood, the house two doors down from him just foreclosed two days ago, and another house down the street was just put up for auction. \"Yup, that one's new. We're seeing more and more of the auctions. They don't want them to sit vacant.\"</p> <p>Banks want to sell the homes, but Ralph says that so few people can get loans due to the frozen credit markets. He said, \"It's going to be a long climb back for a lot of people.\"</p> <p>In the last quarter, Riverside County saw 14,974 notices of default, and it's not just sub-prime or low income home buyers, said Lisa Jarmen, the programme manager for the home ownership department at the Fair Housing Council. The pain has begun to trickle up to more well to do home buyers. Even upper income home buyers bought houses with interest only loans and adjustable rates, and they now find themselves unable to pay. The Housing Council is now taking 500 calls a month from families needing mediation with their lenders.</p> <p>Foreclosed homes are not the only symptom of the crisis. East of Riverside County in communities like Banning and Beaumont and north in Victorville and Apple Valley, housing estates sit half finished in the high desert after funding dried up. Sometimes, builders only dug the basements and poured the foundations before work was forced to stop.</p> <p>Ralph said that his family is feeling the credit crunch. They were looking to repave the parking lot for the commercial property that they own, but it's becoming difficult to find the credit for the project. He's seeing a lot of small retailers closing. Small contractors whose 'bread and butter' was refurbishing homes are now struggling.</p> <p><strong>The political impact</strong></p> <p>\"For all the scrambling for solutions in Washington, I still don't get the feeling that there is a real connect there with the people down here on this level, what they are feeling and what they are going through,\" Ralph said. People are hungry for change.</p> <p>Riverside has been solidly Republican community since people moved east from Orange County in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but he has begun to see Obama signs and bumper stickers in what are traditionally very conservative neighbourhoods.</p> <p>\"Driving around like this four years ago, every fifth or sixth car, you would see \"W\" decal,\" he said, but we didn't see any McCain-Palin bumper stickers during our drive. \"It is a perfect storm with the economy and the effort that the Democrats are putting into this.\"</p> <p>Ralph is a Democrat, but he found it difficult to get enthusiastic about either John Kerry in 2004 or Al Gore in 2000. But he believes that Obama has inspired people to work on behalf of his message of change.</p> <p>Ralph showed me the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevglobal/2927421587/\">new Obama iPhone application</a> designed to help people call undecided voters and find Obama election activities in their area. I've seen Obama volunteers out in force in Washington DC and now Los Angeles. They have been raising money, <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevglobal/2927893025/\">calling voters in swing states</a> and up until the deadline a few days ago, registering new voters.</p> <p>Most of the new voters are not registering because they support the Republican status quo. Ralph said, they want change, any change, because they believe that anything has to be better than what they have now.</p> <p>\"You put together the last eight years, the current economic situation and the war that goes on and on and a really good candidate\" and he isn't surprised that the most recent <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/111052/Gallup-Daily-Obama-52-McCain-41.aspx\">Gallup daily tracking poll shows Barack Obama 11 points ahead</a>.</p> <p>As I said, Ralph e-mailed me. We're in Los Angeles through Saturday. On Sunday, we travel to Las Vegas, a boom town going bust. If you want to get in touch, feel free to <a href=\"mailto:kevin.anderson@guardian.co.uk\">email me too</a>.</p>"
