  "<p>As rebranding campaigns go, it could prove as challenging as McDonald's' transformation from obesity-causing megalith to healthy restaurateur. But speaking for the first time since fresh allegations of sexual assault against him surfaced this year, former TV presenter John Leslie describes his determination to protect his image in today's Guardian. </p> <p>Speaking about his days as a regular on the London party scene, he says: \"I didn't protect the brand. Moi. I was stupid.\" He describes being questioned in connection with a sexual assault in June. He was acquitted in 2003 of two counts of indecent assault on a 23-year-old woman. </p> <p>\"Half of me was going to dig my heels in and not even come in for questioning at all,\" he says. \"Not after the way I had been treated by the police the last time, with all the leaks to the press. But then I think, OK, let's just play it straight, let the police do their job.\"</p> <p>At the police station he says he was confronted by a photographer from the Sun, which splashed the story on its front page. Five weeks later police announced no action would be taken. He denies knowing the woman who accused him.</p> <p>Now a property developer, Leslie talks candidly about his former playboy lifestyle. Asked if he believed he did anything wrong, he says: \"Yeah, of course. I didn't protect the brand ... if I had been a bit more savvy, and protected the brand, I'd still be on television.\"</p>",
  "<p>When John Dankworth and Cleo Laine get a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Welsh Heritage minister to wind up this year's typically classy and imaginative Brecon Jazz Festival, it'll be their second high-profile accolade within a month - in July this unstoppably hip pair of jazz octogenarians won the Gold Award at the BBC Jazz Awards for their contributions to the music over international careers lasting almost 60 years. To judge by the relish with which Laine and Dankworth then launched themselves into a mix of lyrically swinging jazz and a display of Ms Laine's still-captivating contralto tones, the audience for the final Brecon Jazz Festival show on Sunday is likely to feel that the weekend has ended on a suitably uplifting note. Guitarist Wayne Krantz and alto-sax legend Lee Konitz also feature at the festival, along with sparky local performers.</p>",
  "<p>For many people the sight of Russian tanks streaming across a border in August has uncanny echoes of Prague 1968. That cold war reflex is natural enough, but after two decades of Russian retreat from those bastions it is misleading. Not every development in the former Soviet Union is a replay of Soviet history.</p> <p>The clash between Russia and Georgia over South Ossetia, which escalated dramatically yesterday, in truth has more in common with the Falklands war of 1982 than it does with a cold war crisis. When the Argentine junta was basking in public approval for its bloodless recovery of Las Malvinas, Henry Kissinger anticipated Britain's widely unexpected military response with the comment: \"No great power retreats for ever.\" Maybe today Russia has stopped the long retreat to Moscow which started under Gorbachev.</p> <p>Back in the late 1980s, as the USSR waned, the red army withdrew from countries in eastern Europe which plainly resented its presence as the guarantor of unpopular communist regimes. That theme continued throughout the new republics of the deceased Soviet Union, and on into the premiership of Putin, under whom Russian forces were evacuated even from the country's bases in Georgia.</p> <p>To many Russians this vast geopolitical retreat from places which were part of Russia long before the dawn of communist rule brought no bonus in relations with the west. The more Russia drew in its horns, the more Washington and its allies denounced the Kremlin for its imperial ambitions.</p> <p>Unlike in eastern Europe, for instance, today in breakaway states such as South Ossetia or Abkhazia, Russian troops are popular. Vladimir Putin's picture is more widely displayed than that of the South Ossetian president, the former Soviet wrestling champion Eduard Kokoity. The Russians are seen as protectors against a repeat of ethnic cleansing by Georgians.</p> <p>In 1992, the west backed Eduard Shevardnadze's attempts to reassert Georgia's control over these regions. The then Georgian president's war was a disaster for his nation. It left 300,000 or more refugees \"cleansed\" by the rebel regions, but for Ossetians and Abkhazians the brutal plundering of the Georgian troops is the most indelible memory.</p> <p>Georgians have nursed their humiliation ever since. Although Mikheil Saakashvili has done little for the refugees since he came to power early in 2004 - apart from move them out of their hostels in central Tbilisi to make way for property development - he has spent 70% of the Georgian budget on his military. At the start of the week he decided to flex his muscles.</p> <p>Devoted to achieving Nato entry for Georgia, Saakashvili has sent troops to Iraq and Afghanistan - and so clearly felt he had American backing. The streets of the Georgian capital are plastered with posters of George W Bush alongside his Georgian protege. George W Bush avenue leads to Tbilisi airport. But he has ignored Kissinger's dictum: \"Great powers don't commit suicide for their allies.\" Perhaps his neoconservative allies in Washington have forgotten it, too. Let's hope not.</p> <p>Like Galtieri in 1982, Saakashvili faces a domestic economic crisis and public disillusionment. In the years since the so-called Rose revolution, the cronyism and poverty that characterised the Shevardnadze era have not gone away. Allegations of corruption and favouritism towards his mother's clan, together with claims of election fraud, led to mass demonstrations against Saakashvili last November. His ruthless security forces - trained, equipped and subsidised by the west - thrashed the protesters. Lashing out at the Georgians' common enemy in South Ossetia would certainly rally them around the president, at least in the short term.</p> <p>Last September, President Saakashvili suddenly turned on his closest ally in the Rose revolution, defence minister Irakli Okruashvili. Each man accused his former blood brother of mafia links and profiting from contraband. Whatever the truth, the fact that the men seen by the west as the heroes of a post-Shevardnadze clean-up accused each other of vile crimes should warn us against picking a local hero in Caucasian politics.</p> <p>Western geopolitical commentators stick to cold war simplicities about Russia bullying plucky little Georgia. However, anyone familiar with the Caucasus knows that the state bleating about its victim status at the hands of a bigger neighbour can be just as nasty to its smaller subjects. Small nationalisms are rarely sweet-natured.</p> <p>Worse still, western backing for \"equip and train\" programmes in Russia's backyard don't contribute to peace and stability if bombastic local leaders such as Saakashvili see them as a guarantee of support even in a crisis provoked by his own actions. He seems to have thought that the valuable oil pipeline passing through his territory, together with the Nato advisers intermingled with his troops, would prevent Russia reacting militarily to an incursion into South Ossetia. That calculation has proved disastrously wrong.</p> <p>The question now is whether the conflict can be contained, or whether the west will be drawn in, raising the stakes to desperate levels. To date the west has operated radically different approaches to secession in the Balkans, where pro-western microstates get embassies, and the Caucasus, where the Caucasian boundaries drawn up by Stalin, are deemed sacrosanct.</p> <p>In the Balkans, the west promoted the disintegration of multiethnic Yugoslavia, climaxing with their recognition of Kosovo's independence in February. If a mafia-dominated microstate like Montenegro can get western recognition, why shouldn't flawed, pro-Russian, unrecognised states aspire to independence, too?</p> <p>Given its extraordinary ethnic complexity, Georgia is a post-Soviet Union in miniature. If westerners readily conceded non-Russian republics' right to secede from the USSR in 1991, what is the logic of insisting that non-Georgians must remain inside a microempire which happens to be pro-western?</p> <p>Other people's nationalisms are like other people's love affairs, or, indeed, like dog fights. These are things wise people don't get involved in. A war in the Caucasus is never a straightforward moral crusade - but then, how many wars are?</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Mark Almond is a history lecturer at Oriel College, Oxford <a href=\"mailto:mpalmond@aol.com\">mpalmond@aol.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Before flying with his family for a week's holiday in Hawaii yesterday, Barack Obama expressed concern about taking a break in election year. \"During the middle of a campaign you're always worried about taking some time off,\" he said. </p> <p>He may have good reason to worry. He leaves behind a Democratic party that over the past fortnight has been showing signs for the first time of nervousness about the November 4 election.</p> <p>For them, this is supposed to be the Democrats' year, an inevitable march towards the White House after the catastrophic defeats of 2000 and 2004. Almost everything seems to be going their way: unpopular president, disenchantment with the Iraq war, a faltering economy and an inspirational Democratic candidate. </p> <p>What is worrying the Democrats, in spite of all these pluses, is that Obama's poll lead has remained stubbornly small. A tracking poll by RealClearPolitics published yesterday has Obama on 46.9% compared with John McCain's 43.3%.</p> <p>\"I think there are a lot of Democrats who are nervous,\" said Tad Devine, chief strategist for the Kerry White House bid in 2004. \"I think they thought this election would fall into their laps.\"</p> <p>Devine stressed that he was not among the pessimists and cautioned against what he described as \"an artificial expectation that he needs to be way ahead at this time\". </p> <p>But the concern among Democrats is not just over the size of the poll lead but over the impact of negative ads from McCain over the last two weeks that have reawakened bitter memories of Republican tactics in 2000 and 2004. </p> <p>Since the heady days of Obama's address in Berlin in front of an adoring crowd of 200,000 last month, the Democrat has been on the receiving end of ads from McCain portraying him as a celebrity-driven egotist and an elitist out of touch with the American public. </p> <p>\"Obama's bubble has not burst but it is leaking,\" said Peter Brown, assistant director at one of the country's leading pollsters, the Connecticut-based Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. He found it significant that when those surveyed were asked whether they want Democrats or Republicans to win, Democrats emerged with a double-digit lead, but when asked about Obama or McCain, Obama's lead was only in single figures.</p> <p>Brown said that while the expectation is that Obama would win, \"history is replete with northern liberals who end up losing\".</p> <p>McCain, who has struggled since the spring to win media attention, has finally achieved media parity with Obama over the last fortnight because of his negative campaign. Race has been raised as an issue, though McCain accuses Obama of bringing it up first.</p> <p>But the central theme is to portray Obama - shown repeatedly against the backdrop of the Berlin crowds- as messianic, with an ad comparing him to Moses, and too fond of celebrity status, with his image placed alongside Paris Hilton and Britney Spears.</p> <p>A quiz on a Republican website invites readers to guess whether quotes were from Obama, the actors Cameron Diaz and Matt Damon, David Beckham or some other celebrity. The quotes include: \"Anybody gone into Whole Foods lately and see what they charge for arugula [rocket]?\" The answer is Obama. </p> <p>McCain, in spite of being richer than Obama and with a taste for expensive living, such as $520 Ferragamo shoes, presents himself as closer to the grittier world of working-class America. He told a rally of bikers in South Dakota this week: \"Not long ago, a couple of hundred thousand Berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent. I'll take the roar of 50,000 Harleys any day.\" </p> <p>The decision to go for the individual rather than policy is a big decision for any politician but especially for McCain, who suffered badly from negative tactics in the 2000 Republican primary contests at the hands of George Bush and his strategist, Karl Rove. The night he lost, McCain was bouncing around his hotel room in a rage, with his wife Cindy weeping, over his treatment.</p> <h2>Lack of impact</h2> <p>McCain promised to fight an honourable, positive and respectful campaign against Obama but, unable to make an impact, he put aside his resentment over what happened in 2000 and called in a Rove protege, Steve Schmidt. </p> <p>In an interview with the Washington Post last week, McCain defended the change of personnel and tactics . \"If I win this campaign,\" he said, \"historians will say, 'He was a genius.'\"</p> <p>A media backlash against Obama was inevitable and a poll this week by the Pew research organisation suggested the public too were growing weary of the high media exposure and would like to see less of him. Two anti-Obama biographies published this week, the first such books, shot to the top of bestseller lists.</p> <p>The Obama team remains outwardly calm. As they did during the fight for the Democratic nomination, even when trailing Clinton by 30%, they are quietly sticking to their game plan, filling in gaps in Obama's narrative, focusing on domestic issues and raising the millions needed to outspend the Republicans.</p> <p>Professor Michael McDonald, who has built a reputation for number-crunching poll figures at Virginia's George Mason University, acknowledged the negative campaigning had energised Republicans. But there was a downside for the Republicans, he said, such as negative ads feeding into an image of McCain, who turns 72 on August 29, as \"a grumpy old man\".</p> <p>Another plus for Obama is that the negative campaigns encourage Democrats to donate more to his campaign, with McDonald having heard hints that he could have raised a staggering $100m in July, double his previous best.</p> <p>McDonald said the swing voters would not make up their minds until closer to the election, after the party conventions and presidential debates.</p> <p>Devine, who agreed, saw lots of signs for optimism buried in the polling data. These undecideds, when pressed, express a more favourable opinion of Obama than McCain and a dislike of Bush. \"I predict that will be translate into a vote for Obama,\" Devine said, adding: \"All the arrows point to him.\"</p> <h2>Backlash</h2> <p>A media and public backlash in the US against Barack Obama was almost inevitable given the media exposure he has enjoyed so far.</p> <p>In spite of the favourable coverage he received for his trip last month to the Middle East and Europe, there has been no \"bounce\" for him in the polls.</p> <p>Obama enjoys a lead over McCain of only about 3-4%, which is worrying Democrats.</p> <p>A Pew Research poll released on Wednesday found 48% of respondents felt they had been hearing too much about Obama, compared with only 26% for McCain.</p> <p>A recent analysis suggests McCain gained parity of media exposure with Obama in the last fortnight, for the first time in months.</p> <p>McCain has enjoyed some success with a negative campaign portraying Obama as celebrity driven.</p> <p>Two new anti-Obama books were among the bestsellers on Amazon.com's top 20 list on Tuesday.</p>",
  "<p>By the time the international community realised what was happening, it was already too late. It is like that in the Caucasus, a zone of self-igniting conflicts that burn as fiercely as they do instantly. A day which started with a Georgian military offensive to retake South Ossetia - a pro-Russian enclave they had lost control of 14 years ago - ended with Russian warplanes bombing Georgian airfields. Columns of Russian tanks were headed into Tskhinvali, the capital of South Ossetia, and refugees were streaming out.</p> <p>Disentangling claim and counter-claim is as hard as working out the real sequence of events. But there can be little doubt that Georgia's attack with assault troops, multiple-rocket launchers and artillery was a planned military operation. It was not just a reaction to Russian bombing the day before, or a ceasefire that somehow went wrong. The timing of the offensive, when Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin, was in Beijing for the opening of the Olympic games, was also significant. Georgia may have calculated that Mr Putin might be constrained by the company he was keeping in Beijing, not to order an instant counterattack. </p> <p>Anyone familiar with the history of the region could have predicted that Russia would hit back hard. First, the majority of the 75,000 Ossetians are pro-Russian, and have long been angling to join North Ossetia, which is part of the Russian Federation. Second, many Ossetians have now got Russian citizenship and passports. Third, this is a dispute that predates both the Georgian president, Mikhail Saakashvili, and the Putin era. Fourth, rushing to the aid of separatists was a precedent set by the west in Kosovo. Russia gave us fair warning of the consequences.</p> <p>Rather than keep the dispute within a local compass, Mr Saakashvili has done everything in his power to internationalise it. He has banged loudly on Nato's door, and some US leaders have been taken in. The Republican candidate John McCain got a St George's Cross for visiting the Georgian part of South Ossetia last year. The Germans and the French on the other hand resisted Georgia's demand for a membership action plan at the last Nato summit in Bucharest. Georgia's actions yesterday show just how wise Berlin was.</p> <p>Russia is far from blameless. Its official role as peacekeeper in South Ossetia is questionable. It has a history of destabilising independent countries and refusing to accept retreat from empire. But this does not mean that Nato governments should take everything they see at face value. This is not about plucky Georgian democrats versus Russian tyrants. The players in this drama are more devious than that.</p>",
  "<p>In this summer of 2008, it feels as if our future is crystallising before our eyes. Food shortages, the credit crisis, escalating oil prices, a melting Arctic ice cap and the failure of the Doha trade negotiations: one or all of these issues could be the harbingers of profound change for our global civilisation. And just 16 months from now, in December 2009 in Denmark, humanity will face what many argue is its toughest challenge ever: to agree the fundamentals of a climate treaty to succeed the Kyoto protocol.</p> <p>It all seems to have happened so quickly. Just two years ago we received warning of an imminent disaster - a climatic shift that \"could easily be described as hell: so hot, so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive\". The Cassandra was no deep green fundamentalist, but James Lovelock, the acclaimed scientist, pro-nuclear advocate and past adviser to Margaret Thatcher, who, 27 years earlier, had surprised the scientific community with his book Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth (OUP). At a time when reductionist science (which breaks down the world into small units in order to understand it) prevailed, Lovelock took the opposite approach, describing Earth as a single, self-regulating entity, whose function can be disturbed by human activities. It became one of the most influential books of the 20th century.</p> <p>In The Revenge of Gaia (Penguin), published in August 2006, the 86-year-old Lovelock concluded that \"we have unknowingly declared war on Gaia\", and that our only hope of rescue lies in a massive deployment of nuclear energy. The book found a wide readership, yet it failed to mobilise humanity to swift action. His nuclear solution instead divided environmentalists, and the bleakness of his vision was difficult to bear. And again his science went against conventional wisdom, for the most widely accepted assessment of future climate change at the time indicated that his bleak outcome was only a remote possibility.</p> <p>Other, more conventional readings of our climatic future became available in 2006, the most influential of which was Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth. His computer presentation, which became both a successful movie and a bestselling book, opens with dramatic footage of collapsing ice shelves, melting glaciers and hurricane damage, then goes on to catalogue deleterious changes in ecosystems as diverse as tundra and coral reefs. If Lovelock diagnosed Gaia as having a fever, then Gore laid out the symptoms detail by detail. His examples were drawn primarily from refereed scientific publications in the world's leading journals, backed up with personal anecdotes from many of the scientists involved. My own book The Weather Makers (Penguin) draws on the same body of data, as does the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and countless other books and articles written at the time.</p> <p>An Inconvenient Truth was fundamental to the great climatic awakening that occurred late in 2006. I have no doubt that in years to come whole books will be devoted to analysing this shift in global public sentiment, which occurred between mid-August and late September. It is exceedingly rare that a film or book makes such a profound impact, yet An Inconvenient Truth marked the moment when the fossil-fuel industry and its political pawns lost their decades-long grip on public opinion, and perhaps inevitably Gore - who had been Clinton's vice-president and had won the popular vote in the most divisive election in recent US history, only to be denied the presidency by the supreme court - was excoriated in the rightwing press. It was as if the bitter race for the presidency had spilled out into climate science. I was lecturing at universities in middle America in 2007 when Gore and the IPCC were jointly awarded the Nobel peace prize. The naked anger and cynicism - at everything from Gore to peace prizes and Norwegians in general - were frightening.</p> <p>There are dangers in summarising complex science in a 90-minute presentation. Gore was excoriated for explaining that many glaciers are melting - faster indeed than any climatic model predicts - but failing to mention that a very few are growing. Furthermore, his explanation of the causes of climatic change in the geological past was of necessity simple, as was his narrative of contemporary climate change. Both result from a complex interaction of factors, as is well illustrated by the relationship between global warming and hurricane activity. After An Inconvenient Truth was published, researchers discovered that only around half of the increase in global hurricane activity could be directly attributed to an increase in Earth's average temperature. None of this, in my opinion, detracts from the veracity of Gore's exposition.</p> <p>Few books about climate change have been written by the meteorologists and atmospheric physicists that dominate the field. One charming exception is Willi Dansgaard's memoir Frozen Annals (Niels Bohr Institute, 2005). Dansgaard's involvement with climate science goes back to 1947, when he was sent to northwestern Greenland by the Danish weather service. Much of his life has been spent on the Greenland ice cap, drilling, retrieving and analysing the ice cores that provide the key to our understanding of past changes in climate. His book is surprisingly funny and tender, and makes obvious how hard-won is our basic knowledge of climate science.</p> <p>The first attempt at sampling the Greenland ice involved cutting pieces from bergs - an extremely hazardous practice that almost cost Dansgaard his life. While cutting into one, he writes, \"with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off. Fortunately, I fell on to the main part of the chunk, but now it started turning round so I ended up in the water . . . I began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice. There was none . . . I was not afraid of being so close to drowning, but of deserting Inge and our two kids, and I was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance.\" Just \"at that moment a true miracle occurred\" - the arrival of a \"rowboat sent out from Klaushavn\".</p> <p>A critical advance occurred in 1964, when an American-Danish collaboration began at Camp Century, perched high on the Greenland ice cap. The \"camp\" was a massive series of tunnels gouged in the ice, its facilities powered by a nuclear reactor. Spawned of the cold war, the facility had been envisaged as the first stage of a monstrous instrument of conflict, involving the sequestering of 600 nuclear missiles in 4,000km of tunnels. To support it, a city for 11,000 people was to be built inside the mighty ice cap - one of the most hostile and remote environments on Earth. The military planners, however, had failed to remember that ice flows, which means that tunnels and caverns drilled in it soon become hopelessly distorted.</p> <p>Camp Century was destined to play a very different role, for it was here that the first deep drilling into the Greenland ice cap occurred. Dansgaard conveys beautifully what it was like to work in such a bizarre environment, along with the wonders revealed when analysing that core - the discovery of evidence for the little ice age, the medieval warm period, and the great ice age that covered northern Europe and North America. Then, at the very bottom - 1.4km down - the researchers found evidence of a distant time when Earth was slightly warmer than it is today. They had, they realised, pierced right through the 100,000 years of a full glacial cycle - an entire ice age - and had come out the other side into a world that existed 130,000 years ago. It was a triumph they hardly dared hope for.</p> <p>Elucidating the cyclical nature of past changes in climate was the first great achievement of the ice-cap drilling project. One of the more striking cycles they discovered was a rapid warming that occurred every 1,500 years or so throughout the past 100,000 years. These oscillations between warm and cold conditions are now known as Dansgaard-Oeschger events.</p> <p>A sophisticated understanding of the great climatic cycles has permitted a new approach to the climate problem that finds its closest parallel in the \"wiggle matching\" used by stock-market analysis. William Ruddiman is a climatic historian whose book Ploughs, Plagues and Petroleum, published by Princeton in 2005, uses this approach to identify evidence of human impact on the climate system, by identifying precisely where we are in the current cycle and comparing the trend with earlier ones. We are, he explains, 12,000 years into a cooling phase which, judging from previous cycles, should continue for tens of thousands of years more. Instead the world is warming. But what is most remarkable about Ruddiman's work is the evidence it provides for an initial disruption to the climate system that occurred long before the industrial revolution - around 8,000 years ago. </p> <p>It was then, at the dawn of agriculture, that the \"wiggle\" of the current cycle first departed from earlier patterns - for instead of cooling, Earth's average temperature remained remarkably stable. Ruddiman thinks that this was caused by carbon and methane being released into the atmosphere from early agriculture and the destruction of forests. In his account, human activity and the great cycles struck a delicate balance that allowed the flowering of civilisations. He also sees evidence in the ice cores for the consequences of the Black Death (a drop of around two parts per million of CO2 as forests grew over abandoned fields, absorbing carbon from the atmosphere), as well as other historic events. Aspects of his work remain highly contentious, yet I believe that Ruddiman's realisation that the gaseous composition of Earth's atmosphere is an exquisitely sensitive barometer of changes to life itself represents a great breakthrough.</p> <p>Now that the majority of politicians, industry leaders and the public are convinced there is a climate problem, the focus is on what to do. The most influential assessments of the problem's scale are doubtless those of the IPCC, whose projections of various outcomes form the basis of global negotiations and national action plans. One of the most influential of these projections concerns the extent to which Earth's surface will warm over the next century. The lower bound is 1.4\u00b0C; the upper bound is 5.8\u00b0C. This is an extraordinary range of possible impacts - 1.4\u00b0C poses some threat, but 5.8\u00b0C is widely recognised as sufficient to induce a Lovelockian Ragnarok. The chance of either outcome, according to the IPCC, is small - less than 10%, and so political dialogue has come to concentrate on the mid-range of the projections.</p> <p>The moment of truth will arrive in December 2009, in Copenhagen, when the world's political leaders will come together to decide the basis of a new global treaty to replace the Kyoto protocol. It's no overstatement to say that the Copenhagen protocol, as it may well come to be known, will play a large role in deciding the fate of humanity. It will come into force in 2012, and if it fails to deliver we'll have to wait until 2020 for a replacement. That will be too late.</p> <p>A number of recent publications assess the costs versus the benefits of action to combat climate change. Among the most influential, and the most hotly contested, is the Stern review on the economics of climate change, a dense 692-page argument, published last year, the most famous finding of which is that \"the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting\". Nicholas Stern's argument was challenged almost immediately in Cool It by the Danish statistician Bj\u00f8rn Lomborg, author of The Skeptical Environmentalist (Cambridge University Press).</p> <p>Lomborg does not doubt that global warming is occurring, nor that it is caused by humans, but almost alone among commentators he finds reason to welcome it. In Europe, he explains, only 200,000 people die from excess heat each year, while 1.5 million die from cold. His message is simple: more warming, less death. Lomborg's style is marked by glib, misleading associations. Even if the sea rises, Lomborg says, we shouldn't worry - we'll just put up dykes. With dykes, he asserts, some nations might end up with more land than they have today. And so the arguments go on, from rising seas to extreme weather events to malaria and other tropical diseases, the collapse of the Gulf Stream, food shortages and water shortages. In one case after another, Lomborg asserts that it's cheaper and better to do nothing immediate to combat climate change, but to invest in adapting to its consequences. It is in great contrast to Stern's painstaking and detailed analysis, and it entirely fails to dent Stern's case.</p> <p>In A Question of Balance: Weighing the Options on Global Warming Policies (Yale), the respected economist William Nordhaus asks how to deal most cost-effectively with the climate problem. He accepts the projections of the IPCC as a correct basis on which to undertake his analysis, and sets out to examine five policy options, ranging from \"do nothing\" through to \"ambitious\" proposals such as those advocated by Gore and Stern. He concludes that the ambitious proposals are disastrously expensive, and should be avoided. But do the IPCC projections reliably reflect future changes in climate?</p> <p>In 2007, scientists began comparing real-world trends with the panel's projections. They found that for the key performance indicators - the rate of warming, the rise in sea level and CO2 accumulation - real-world changes were at the upper bound or beyond the worst-case scenario presented by the IPCC. Further evidence that climate change is moving faster than we thought can be found at the north pole. The sea ice that covers the Arctic Ocean has glistened brightly into space for at least 3m years, and by reflecting the sun's energy it acts as a refrigerator that cools the entire planet. But where the ice melts, the dark ocean is revealed, and that captures solar energy and turns it into heat. </p> <p>In the summer of 2005, the rate of ice loss accelerated dramatically and has remained high ever since, the summer of 2007 seeing the greatest loss of Arctic ice ever. The scientific community is split on how the melting will turn out this year. A recent survey of Arctic specialists indicated that the majority consider a loss as great as that of 2007 to be unlikely, yet by June 2008 signs of a great melt were emerging and a senior adviser to the Norwegian government was warning that this may be the Arctic's first ice-free year. As I write, the rate of loss, while still well above average, has slowed somewhat. Yet even now it's impossible to predict. We can only project that if this summer's melt trajectory follows recent decades, by September this year the Arctic ice cap will have lost around half of its remaining ice, and be just 2.2m square kilometres.</p> <p>Most of those interested in climate science nowadays access information online, and one of the most significant of such contributions was recently posted by James Hansen, director of Nasa's Goddard Institute, and his colleagues, who have provided a partial explanation for these changes. They revisited a key piece of science underpinning the IPCC's work - the findings about how much warming a given amount of atmospheric CO2 pollution would produce - and discovered that, when viewed over the longer term, Earth's climate system is about twice as sensitive to CO2 pollution as is illustrated in the panel's century-long projections. One conclusion they drew is that there is already enough greenhouse gas pollution in the atmosphere to cause 2\u00b0C of warming - bringing about conditions not seen on Earth for 2m to 3m years, and constituting, according to the authors, \"a degree of warming that would surely yield 'dangerous' climate impacts\".</p> <p>Hansen and his colleagues pointed to a new understanding of how long it takes for the full warming consequences of a given amount of greenhouse gas to be felt. They concluded that we could expect to feel a third of any warming in the first few years. As Hansen and his colleagues put it: \"Sea-level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record, in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human-made forcing. This indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed, and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed.\"</p> <p>They also make a useful discrimination between climatic \"tipping points\" and \"the point of no return\". A tipping point is that at which the greenhouse gas concentration reaches a level sufficient to cause catastrophic climate change, while a point of no return is reached when that concentration of greenhouse gas has been in place sufficiently long to begin an irreversible process. Humanity is currently suspended between a tipping point and a point of no return, and the point of no return is likely to be reached within two decades.</p> <p>In summarising their findings, the researchers state that \"if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on Earth is adapted, palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that CO2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm\". This, they believe, can only be achieved by phasing out all conventional coal burning by 2030, and by aggressively reducing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere by capturing it in growing tropical forests and in agricultural soils. That a rapid phase-out of coal is simply not enough is elegantly illustrated by the fact that the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere would remain above 350ppm for 200 years were a coal phase-out achieved within the next decade or two, and nothing else done.</p> <p>In his analysis, Nordhaus does identify one economically effective strategy worth pursuing. Called the \"low-cost backstop\", it revolves around identifying and developing some as yet unknown technology to combat the problem. Possible candidates include \"low-cost solar power, geothermal energy, some non-intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon-eating trees\".</p> <p>Writing in the New York Review of Books, Freeman Dyson has explored the unappealing option of such trees. The graph that first alerted humanity to the climate problem - drawn up by Charles David Keeling to show the CO2 increase from 1956 to the present - might, Dyson argues, hold the key to the solution. The graph has a generally rising line, with jags, like saw teeth, along it, which indicate a spike in CO2 each autumn in the northern hemisphere and a dip each spring. The difference between the minimum and maximum each year is around six parts per million, and it is due to the growth, then leaf fall, of the forests that grow across North America, Europe and Asia. It turns out, Dyson says, \"that about 8% of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year\".</p> <p>If only a way could be found, he muses, to permanently sequester that carbon, we would go a long way towards solving the climate crisis - hence the genetically modified trees. But the truth is that all trees are carbon eaters. They grow from the air by drawing CO2 into their leaves, and there solidifying it to build their wood, bark and leaf tissues. Trees are congealed CO2. What we need is a way of transforming the carbon they capture into an inert state. It turns out that humanity has had the capacity to do this for thousands of years, and is now on the brink of doing it on a very large scale.</p> <p>The process of charcoal-making is called pyrolysis, and involves the heating of any biological matter in the absence of oxygen. The result is the generation of a synthetic gas, or a crude-oil like material, and charcoal. If the gas or oily matter is captured, it can be used to generate electricity or power transport. The charcoal is largely carbon (representing one-third to half of the carbon in the biomass) and it is inert. Indeed, the tenacity with which charcoal resists rotting, even when buried in the soil, is clear from C14-dating, which uses ancient charcoal from hearths or fires as much as 60,000 years old.</p> <p>Modern pyrolysis involves machinery that captures flue gas or oil, and needs no external inputs to run the machine (some of the gas being used to heat the biomass). It's already being used on a small scale on farms, for urban garbage disposal (where 1,000-tonne units are deployed) and in forestry. On farms it has multiple benefits, for the charcoal can be ploughed back into the soil, where it balances acid soils, aids soil moisture retention, adds nutrients and acts as a habitat for soil fungi and bacteria. A farmer pyrolysing crop waste gains four benefits: 1) as usual, he gets to sell the commercial part of his crop; 2) he gets to generate electricity or transport fuel; 3) where carbon is traded, he can potentially sell the carbon he sequesters; and 4) by adding charcoal to his soil, he will increase the chances of getting a better crop the following year.</p> <p>With so many benefits, why is pyrolysis not more widely used? Because pyrolysis machines are expensive, and farms are mostly still family businesses. If farmers are ever to be able to afford the machines, they'll need to be paid around $37 per tonne for the carbon they create. They'll also need to be living in areas with carbon trading schemes that allow charcoal as a recognised method of carbon sequestration.</p> <p>While the developed world could go it alone with pyrolysis, unless China and India can be induced to take a lower carbon path than the west, there is absolutely no hope for us. While both maintain formidably tough international negotiating positions, there are signs of change, particularly in the energy sectors of both countries. China has a target for renewable energy of 10% by 2020, and is embarking on the largest nuclear power programme currently being developed, while India is pursuing wind and hydro power.</p> <p>Were the leaders of either country seeking a guide to determining a negotiating position in Copenhagen, they could do no better than Oliver Tickell's just-published book Kyoto2 (Zed Books), which provides a big-picture approach to the prevention of climatic catastrophe. In essence, Tickell provides a blueprint for a global climate treaty. He documents the failings of the Kyoto protocol, then goes on to summarise the latest climate science, including the work of Hansen and his colleagues. The replacement to the Kyoto protocol, Tickell writes, must work effectively to achieve a level of atmospheric CO2 below 350ppm. At the heart of the proposal is a global trade in carbon with a series of reducing caps sufficiently rigorous to bring about such an outcome. </p> <p>One of Tickell's most telling criticisms of Kyoto is its neglect of tropical forests as a means of sequestering carbon. The destruction of rainforests causes around 18% of the carbon going into the atmosphere annually, yet only a single project concerning tropical forests has been approved under Kyoto's clean development mechanisms. These allow for polluters to gain credits by investing in a variety of ways that reduce greenhouse gases. Dyson's analysis of the Keeling curve demonstrates just how powerful forests can be as sequesterers of carbon. It's widely acknowledged that Kyoto's successor must develop mechanisms that encourage the protection and regrowing of tropical forests.</p> <p>Tickell's discussion of market mechanisms is densely technical, yet much of it reads as common sense. His emphasis on the urgent need for government regulation is also cogent and refreshing, for he recognises that carbon trading is necessary, but not sufficient to solve the problem. He calls clearly for governments to regulate so as to increase efficiency of energy use, to protect forests and to mandate approaches such as clean coal technologies, as well as discussing the need to limit population. Reading Kyoto2 gives one hope that there is a way forward. But will such recommendations ever be agreed to, and can they be carried out in time? </p> <h2>The books to read</h2> <p><strong>George Monbiot</strong><br>George Marshall, author of Carbon Detox (Gaia Books), understands the psychology of climate change and our inability to get to grips with it better than anyone else I have read. Mark Lynas's Six Degrees: Our Future on a Hotter Planet (Fourth Estate) is a lucid and deeply researched account of the predicted impacts of climate change, one degree at a time. In Kyoto2: How to Manage the Global Greenhouse (Zed Books) Oliver Tickell presents a global programme for cutting greenhouse gas emissions that is both radical and realistic. </p> <p><strong>Caroline Lucas</strong><br>Seeing Green by Jonathon Porritt (currently out of print) changed my life. After reading it, I marched straight to the office of my local Green party to sign up. George Marshall's Carbon Detox is an upbeat and inspiring guide to lowering your carbon footprint. The Flood (Saqi Books), Maggie Gee's dystopian vision of a flooded future, with its well-drawn characters and lively prose, shows how the poor will always be the first to suffer the effects of climate change.</p> <p><strong>Mark Lynas</strong><br>In Kyoto2, Oliver Tickell makes a radical suggestion: that instead of trying to regulate emissions of carbon dioxide, we should instead go \"upstream\" and regulate the production of carbon-based fossil fuels. Think of a garden sprinkler: if you want to stop the lawn getting wet, you don't try to catch each drop as it falls - you turn off the tap.</p> <p>The World Without Us (Virgin Books) by Alan Weisman contains a disarmingly simple but wonderfully clever idea: what would the planet look like if we all disappeared overnight? The perfect springboard for a much more engaging and fascinating discussion of humanity's environmental impact.</p> <p><strong>Fred Pearce</strong><br>Rachel Carson's Silent Spring (Penguin Modern Classics), published in 1962, was environmentalism's tipping point. Before Silent Spring, we worried about saving wildlife; afterwards we feared our own species would drown in a toxic tide of chemicals. In 1979 came Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth (OUP) by James Lovelock. Not since Charles Darwin's Origin of Species has any book so shaken science's sense of how our world works. John Reader's Man on Earth (published in 1988 and currently out of print) is an overlooked masterpiece about the ecology of human cultures.</p> <p><strong>Leo Hickman</strong><br>Robert Henson's Rough Guide to Climate Change (Rough Guides) is the best pocketbook primer on the subject. On its publication in late 2006, it was sent to every MP with a short questionnaire, including the question \"How important a concern is climate change?\" Hundreds answered, the majority of whom said it was the most pressing issue of our age. Gordon Brown never responded.</p> <p>Hide Tide by Mark Lynas (Picador) is a journey through the climate change \"hot spots\" of the world. It's the testimonies of the people Lynas meets who are already suffering from the onset of climate change that produce the most persuasive argument for us to urgently face up to the challenge ahead.</p> <p><strong>Laurie David</strong><br>Earth in the Balance (Longman), written by Al Gore 15 years ago, is doubly fascinating to read now. It makes you realise how much he was right. I devoted myself to the issue of climate change after reading Ross Gelbspan's Boiling Point (Basic Books). If you look at Keith Bradsher's High &amp; Mighty (PublicAffairs US), you will never walk past an SUV again without shaking your head.</p> <p>What Al Gore is to awareness of global warming, William McDonough is to the solution. His Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things (Rodale Press) is the only book about the environment that is actually waterproof. Also read anything by Gus Speth or Bill McKibben.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Alpha Dogs: How Spin Became a Global Business </strong><br>by James Harding <br>384pp, Atlantic, \u00a322<br><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781843548171\">Buy it at the Guardian bookshop</a></p> <p><strong>The Fame Formula: How Hollywood's Fixers, Fakers and Star Makers Created the Celebrity Industry</strong> <br>by Mark Borkowski<br>322pp, Sidgwick &amp; Jackson, \u00a316.99<br><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780283070396\">Buy it at the Guardian bookshop</a></p> <p>In June 1997, some of us PR consultants who had volunteered to work on New Labour's election campaign staggered out of the victory party at the South Bank centre and blinked in Tony Blair's new dawn. We sniffed the excitement of change. We also smelt a business opportunity: to take the fascination with the biggest brand turnaround in recent history - unelectable old Labour into shiny New Labour - and to peddle it to the corporate sector, using the campaign and media management techniques pioneered by Clinton and taken up by Blair. We thought we had hit on something new.</p> <p>Of course, the Americans had beaten us to it two decades earlier. How they \"took political spin and turned it into a global business\" is the subject of one of two books looking at the rise of the public relations business.</p> <p>James Harding, now editor of the Times and formerly the FT's Washington correspondent, focuses on the Sawyer Miller Group, the pioneering US political consultancy that saw in television the foundation of the new \"electronic democracy\" and sold its campaign techniques first to politicians, and then to business leaders.</p> <p>David Sawyer and Scott Miller built a PR powerhouse that took politics out of smoke-filled rooms and into people's living rooms the world over. They helped democratic revolutions in Chile and the Philippines and brought political campaign strategies to brands such as Apple and Coca-Cola, producing many of today's most successful PR leaders in both the political and commercial sectors. </p> <p>While Harding's basic premise is that PR = spin = bad, he has produced a meticulously researched micro-history of a small US company that made a big difference in international politics in the 1980s, as well as to modern brand communications. He is happy to note how Sawyer Miller used its campaign skills to aid democratic candidates around the world, but tut-tuts at how it took these skills to corporate America. </p> <p>He tells a lot of good stories, and tells them well. The book opens with a timely one, chronicling the spectacular turnaround in the fortunes of a monumentally unpopular and out-of-touch mayor of Boston, who was re-elected against all the odds using the tactics of the Sawyer Miller guys. </p> <p>If Harding sees political spin as one foundation stone of modern PR, the leading publicist Mark Borkowski sees Hollywood as the other. Borkowski cut his teeth in theatre publicity, and was one of the first PRs in the UK to realise that businesses hankered after the pixie dust they saw in the celebrity PR industry. In The Fame Formula, he pursues his passion for the history and power of the movie publicist.</p> <p>While Harding can occasionally come across as moralising, right down to dwelling on who at Sawyer Miller was sleeping with whom and how much money they were out to make, Borkowski is unashamedly the kid at the sweet-shop window in his enthusiasm for the golden age of the Hollywood celebrity publicity business, despite the seediness of the star system.</p> <p>The Fame Formula establishes Borkowski as the unofficial curator of the House of Spin, or at least its glittering celebrity wing. Forget the silly maths equation of the title that he slips in at the end of the book. This is a behind-the-scenes look at one of the biggest forces shaping popular culture over the past century: from the Hollywood highs of silent movie vamps, through Clark Gable and Jean Harlow, to the tabloid lows of Jade Goody and Heather Mills, via Tom Cruise and a galaxy of stars and their publicists. It doesn't need a gimmick to sell it.</p> <p>In truth, the star makers and stuntsters whose exploits Borkowski lovingly details were far more cynical and manipulative than the campaign consultants James Harding frets about in Alpha Dogs, but they are also great fun. Whether it is Betty Grable insuring her legs for a million dollars, or the publicist Jim Moran sitting on an ostrich egg for 20 days and then adopting the chick to promote a new movie, Borkowski relates classic publicity stunts that would have some of today's PR gurus weeping into their Groucho Club martinis. </p> <p>He starts off looking at the careers of publicists such as Harry Reichenbach (who first realised the commercial potential of Mickey Mouse) and Maynard Nottage, men who came out of circuses and cowboy roadshows to build the early stars of the silent movies. He looks at how the press agents became \"suppress agents\", managing the squeaky-clean reputations of their stars by keeping the drugs, sex scandals and even murders out of the news. Take Harry Brand, keen to deflect attention from his client Marilyn Monroe's infamous nude photoshoot, who put out the story that she would look good in a potato sack - and created the photo opportunity to prove it. </p> <p>He shows us how stunts like Andrew Lloyd Webber's TV searches for his new Nancy or Maria can be traced back to the mega-hype for Gone with the Wind and the trawl for the actress to play Scarlett O'Hara. The Fame Formula is a terrific, witty romp through the - often dirty - undies of the Hollywood fame factory and draws some interesting conclusions about modern-day celebrity culture.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the \"electronic revolution\" noted in Harding's brief history has become the internet revolution, and once again business leaders (as well as Brown and Cameron) are looking to the web warriors of the Obama and McCain campaigns for the next generation of campaign techniques to adapt to corporate communications. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Colin Byrne is chief executive of Weber Shandwick UK and Ireland</p>",
  "<p>John Edwards, the former Democratic vice-presidential nominee, today admitted having an extramarital affair with a film-maker who worked on his campaign but he denied fathering the woman's six-month-old child.</p> <p>In a statement released late today, Edwards expressed remorse for his actions. \"I used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it. But being 99% honest is no longer enough. I was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices, and I had hoped that it would never become public,\" he said.</p> <p>Edwards denied the allegations of an affair as recently as two weeks ago before telling ABC news he had lied about his relationship with Rielle Hunter, 42, who was paid $114,000 to film documentaries for his campaign. </p> <p>Edwards' wife, Elizabeth, was diagnosed with incurable breast cancer in the spring of 2007, after the boyish presidential hopeful began seeing Hunter. Elizabeth's popularity with female voters helped keep Edwards in contention during this year's Democratic primary race.</p> <p>Edwards has faced pressure to address his ties to Hunter since he was caught meeting the film-maker at a posh Los Angeles hotel last month. </p> <p>The National Enquirer described Edwards hiding himself in a bathroom to avoid questioning and printed a photo of him holding Hunter's daughter, Frances Quinn. The baby was dubbed his \"love child\".</p> <p>In the Democrat's interview with ABC, he claimed the affair had ended before Frances was conceived. </p> <p>In the statement, Edwards confirmed his readiness to take a test to prove that he didn't father Hunter's daughter. \"I am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that I am not the father of any baby,\" he said.</p> <p>Another former Edwards aide, Andrew Young, has said he is the baby's father. The original birth certificate did not identify a father.</p> <p>The scandal threatens to throw Democrats off-course as they prepare to formally nominate Barack Obama, whom Edwards endorsed in May. </p> <p>Four years after he accepted the party's vice-presidential nod, Edwards could be asked not to speak publicly during the lavish nominating convention later this month.</p> <p>Elizabeth Edwards has reportedly been offered a speaking slot at the event.</p> <p>David Bonior, who managed Edwards' latest presidential campaign, said the former North Carolina senator had \"betrayed\" his supporters.</p> <p>\"Thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and he's let them down,\" Bonior told the Associated Press. </p> <p>Asked if the scandal would finish Edwards' political career, Bonior replied: \"You can't lie in politics and expect to have people's confidence.\"</p> <p>Hunter, a divorcee, met Edwards in a New York bar in 2006 and was hired by his campaign despite little film-making experience. She later travelled around the US and to Africa with the candidate.</p>",
  "<p>On Wednesday, a new poll stated that <a href=\"http://politicalwire.com/archives/2008/08/06/ppp_poll_mccain_retakes_florida_lead.html\">John McCain has regained a narrow lead over Barack Obama in Florida</a>, largely due, in the pollster's words, to \"your prototypical Hillary Clinton supporters\" <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/PPP_Release_Florida_805.pdf\">crossing over to McCain</a> (pdf). </p> <p>It's more than strange. How can purported feminists even contemplate voting for McCain when his creepy, fighter-jock attitude toward women has left a trail throughout his public career? Let's look at just three dots of gender jokes over time and see if we can connect them.<br> First, there's the boffo <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0708/11823.html \">ape-rape joke</a>. \"Did you hear the one about the woman who is attacked on the street by a gorilla, beaten senseless, raped repeatedly and left to die?\" McCain reportedly asked an audience during his 1986 Senate campaign, according to Arizona's Tucson Citizen. \"When she finally regains consciousness and tries to speak, her doctor leans over to hear her sigh contently and to feebly ask, 'Where is that marvelous ape?'\" <br> McCain's aides said last month that he doesn't recall telling the joke, but they don't deny that he did. Then there's <a href=\"http://rawstory.com/news/2008/McCain_temper_boiled_over_in_92_0407.html\">the c-word</a>. In his book <a href=\"http://www.realmccainbook.com/\">The Real McCain</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/cliffschecter\">Cliff Schecter</a> writes that at a 1992 campaign stop, with reporters nearby, McCain was joined by his wife Cindy and two campaign aides. \"At one point, Cindy playfully twirled McCain's hair and said, 'You're getting a little thin up there.' McCain's face reddened, and he responded, 'At least I don't plaster on the makeup like a trollop, you cunt.' McCain's excuse was that it had been a long day. If elected president of the United States, McCain would have many long days.\" <br> Finally, there's the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4X6XqNeF1o&amp;feature=related\">Buffalo Chip moment at the Sturgis biker rally</a> earlier this week. We don't know what Cindy was thinking when her husband lost it over his male-pattern baldness, but on Monday, when McCain volunteered her for a \"beauty pageant\" before some 50,000 bikers at the annual South Dakota motorcycle rally, she played along, gamely waving and smiling. \"I was looking at the Sturgis schedule,\" said the senator, reading from notes, \"and noticed that you had a beauty pageant, so I encouraged Cindy to compete. I told her with a little luck, she could be the only woman to serve as both the first lady and Miss Buffalo Chip.\"<br> McCain hasn't spoken about it, but many in the press have claimed <em>for</em> him that he <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/05/cindy-mccain-as-miss-buffalo-chip/?scp=1&amp;sq=mccain%20%22buffalo%20chip%22&amp;st=cse\">probably had no idea the contest was topless</a> and occasionally bottomless (much less that, during the weeklong boozin', druggin' hogfest some of the girls occasionally get roughed up, all noted in <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/page2/s/caple/020809.html\">this ESPN dispatch</a>, widely circulating days before McCain's visit). But presumably, McCain did realise that this was a <em>biker</em> rally - a good place to find someone you want to have a beer with.<br> So what if he knew, some liberals, like <a href=\"http://slog.thestranger.com/2008/08/miss_buffalo_chipgate\">sex columnist Dan Savage</a>, counter. \"We're not the party of idiotic, knee-jerk prudery, and we look ridiculous when we pretend that we are.\" <br> Try telling Hillary-strength feminists that objecting to these sorts of slurs is prudish, though. And when you combine them with McCain's stubborn resistance to women's rights - on equal pay, workplace discrimination, abortion, you name it - you should have a formula for female vote repellent. The man's even voted to \"amend the definition of those eligible for the State Children's Health Insurance Program (S-Chip) to include the unborn - while voting against legislation to expand S-Chip's coverage to low-income children and pregnant women at least six times,\" as <a href=\"http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/3799/mcsexist/\">In These Times recounts in its August cover story, \"McSexist\"</a>.<br> And, ladies, don't forget his promise: \"I've said as often as I can,\" he <a href=\"http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/news/politics/blog/2008/01/more_on_mccain_and_alito.html\">reassured the National Review</a>, \"that I want to find clones of [justice Samuel] Alito and [chief justice John] Roberts\" to fill supreme court vacancies.<br> Ah, but those are issues, and all of us tend to selectively block out entire slabs of issues. You might, however, expect that this trio of degrading digs are exactly the sort of big, sexy, cartoon-bright news items that would bust through the gauze of voting records and get the full-monty media treatment of, say, Jesse Jackson saying he wanted to cut off Obama's \"nuts\", a Paris/Britney ad or even a day's worth of the Rev Jeremiah Wright. Not so much, though. Hillary die-hards flirting with McCain can plausibly say they haven't seen much beyond his myth. Corporate media can claim it isn't connecting the dots for them because the dots are too dirty for TV. The Buffalo Chip story, for instance, never made the networks. On cable \u2013 surprise - Fox barely touched it, other than a bit on Fox and Friends, according to a Media Matters search. Of course, MSNBC was all over it, showing the cleaner clips from a video of the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVQHJd_3J7g\">2007 Miss Buffalo Chip contest</a> that included booty-shaking, banana-fondling, pickle-licking and (this last even MSNBC host Keith Olbermann had to skip) simulated fellatio.<br> As for the ape rape joke, even a sanitised version seems too nasty for the New York Times or Washington Post. Meanwhile, the mainstream media is unwilling to quote McCain blurting a word as old-fashioned as trollop, and is even less likely to print \"cunt\" or even the neutralised version, the \"c-word\". To appreciate the effect of this kind of prudery - and how the press de-sexistises McCain - check out this <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFCl3EUMHSc\">skit by the Public Service Administration</a>.</p> <p>As usual, it comes down to the media's and the public's reluctance to give up the image of McCain as a rogueish but honourable \"maverick\", a Peck's bad boy you want to tousle before you take away his slingshot and pet frog.<br> NBC's Andrea Mitchell has reasoned that McCain's nastiness is due to his handlers keeping the poor guy \"inside a bubble\". Hardball's Mike Barnacle and Politico's Roger Simon were <a href=\"http://tpmtv.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/08/pundits_defend_john_mccain_aga.php\">quick to agree</a>.<br> When it comes to his rough public treatment of women, McCain and his apologists have the excuse at hand that he's an early-'60s, martini-and-mistress <a href=\"http://www.amctv.com/originals/madmen/\">Mad Men</a> kind of guy, an image not without its retro charm. One of the fascinations of the series is the way it allows us to see the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/25/AR2008072500734.html\">open culture of sexism at work</a>. It doesn't happen like that anymore, so it's a little like a CGI effect, comparable to seeing Arnold Schwarzenegger sit up after a shotgun blast to the chest in Terminator. (And like the Mad Men lead, Don Draper, McCain is a war hero, a status that wipes clean all slates, including Draper stealing a dead soldier's name and McCain's cheating on his first wife with Cindy.)<br> Meanwhile, Obama, one of our most feminist presidential candidates ever, continues to be black. And that leads to the turnabout-is-fair-play question that's been asked a lot, but needs to be asked at least through November: What if Obama had offered Michelle up in a biker beauty contest, or had called her a cunt? Tabloid headlines of \"baby mama\" undoubtedly would be revived, and African-American family values would be roundly condemned as fundamentally risky for the White House. Of course, many Clinton supporters have given up the ghost and moved on to Obama. But those Hillary hold-outs, perhaps re-stoked by talk of putting her name into nomination at the Democratic convention, are bitterly clinging to Obama's slights against womanhood (\"You're likeable enough, Hillary\") while closing their eyes to McCain's sledgehammers. It's like sleeping with the enemy.</p>",
  "<p>Before flying with his family for a week's holiday in Hawaii today, Barack Obama expressed concern about taking a break in election year. \"During the middle of a campaign you're always worried about taking some time off,\" he said. </p> <p>He may have good reason to worry. He leaves behind a Democratic party that over the past fortnight has been showing signs for the first time of nervousness about the November 4 election.</p> <p>For them, this is supposed to be the Democrats' year, an inevitable march towards the White House after the catastrophic defeats of 2000 and 2004. Almost everything seems to be going their way: unpopular president, disenchantment with the Iraq war, a faltering economy and an inspirational Democratic candidate. </p> <p>What is worrying the Democrats, in spite of all these pluses, is that Obama's poll lead has remained stubbornly small. A tracking poll by RealClearPolitics published today has Obama on 46.9% compared with John McCain's 43.3%.</p> <p>\"I think there are a lot of Democrats who are nervous,\" said Tad Devine, chief strategist for the Kerry White House bid in 2004. \"I think they thought this election would fall into their laps.\"</p> <p>Devine stressed that he was not among the pessimists and cautioned against what he described as \"an artificial expectation that he needs to be way ahead at this time\". </p> <p>But the concern among Democrats is not just over the size of the poll lead but over the impact of negative ads from McCain over the last two weeks that have reawakened bitter memories of Republican tactics in 2000 and 2004. </p> <p>Since the heady days of Obama's address in Berlin in front of an adoring crowd of 200,000 last month, the Democrat has been on the receiving end of ads from McCain portraying him as a celebrity-driven egotist and an elitist out of touch with the American public. </p> <p>\"Obama's bubble has not burst but it is leaking,\" said Peter Brown, assistant director at one of the country's leading pollsters, the Connecticut-based Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. He found it significant that when those surveyed were asked whether they want Democrats or Republicans to win, Democrats emerged with a double-digit lead, but when asked about Obama or McCain, Obama's lead was only in single figures.</p> <p>Brown said that while the expectation is that Obama would win, \"history is replete with northern liberals who end up losing\".</p> <p>McCain, who has struggled since the spring to win media attention, has finally achieved media parity with Obama over the last fortnight because of his negative campaign. Race has been raised as an issue, though McCain accuses Obama of bringing it up first.</p> <p>But the central theme is to portray Obama - shown repeatedly against the backdrop of the Berlin crowds- as messianic, with an ad comparing him to Moses, and too fond of celebrity status, with his image placed alongside Paris Hilton and Britney Spears.</p> <p>A quiz on a Republican website invites readers to guess whether quotes were from Obama, the actors Cameron Diaz and Matt Damon, David Beckham or some other celebrity. The quotes include: \"Anybody gone into Whole Foods lately and see what they charge for arugula [rocket]?\" The answer is Obama. </p> <p>McCain, in spite of being richer than Obama and with a taste for expensive living, such as $520 Ferragamo shoes, presents himself as closer to the grittier world of working-class America. He told a rally of bikers in South Dakota this week: \"Not long ago, a couple of hundred thousand Berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent. I'll take the roar of 50,000 Harleys any day.\" </p> <p>The decision to go for the individual rather than policy is a big decision for any politician but especially for McCain, who suffered badly from negative tactics in the 2000 Republican primary contests at the hands of George Bush and his strategist, Karl Rove. The night he lost, McCain was bouncing around his hotel room in a rage, with his wife Cindy weeping, over his treatment.</p> <p><strong>Lack of impact</strong></p> <p>McCain promised to fight an honourable, positive and respectful campaign against Obama but, unable to make an impact, he put aside his resentment over what happened in 2000 and called in a Rove protege, Steve Schmidt. </p> <p>In an interview with the Washington Post last week, McCain defended the change of personnel and tactics . \"If I win this campaign,\" he said, \"historians will say, 'He was a genius.'\"</p> <p>A media backlash against Obama was inevitable and a poll this week by the Pew research organisation suggested the public too were growing weary of the high media exposure and would like to see less of him. Two anti-Obama biographies published this week, the first such books, shot to the top of bestseller lists.</p> <p>The Obama team remains outwardly calm. As they did during the fight for the Democratic nomination, even when trailing Clinton by 30%, they are quietly sticking to their game plan, filling in gaps in Obama's narrative, focusing on domestic issues and raising the millions needed to outspend the Republicans.</p> <p>Professor Michael McDonald, who has built a reputation for number-crunching poll figures at Virginia's George Mason University, acknowledged the negative campaigning had energised Republicans. But there was a downside for the Republicans, he said, such as negative ads feeding into an image of McCain, who turns 72 on August 29, as \"a grumpy old man\".</p> <p>Another plus for Obama is that the negative campaigns encourage Democrats to donate more to his campaign, with McDonald having heard hints that he could have raised a staggering $100m in July, double his previous best.</p> <p>McDonald said the swing voters would not make up their minds until closer to the election, after the party conventions and presidential debates.</p> <p>Devine, who agreed, saw lots of signs for optimism buried in the polling data. These undecideds, when pressed, express a more favourable opinion of Obama than McCain and a dislike of Bush. \"I predict that will be translate into a vote for Obama,\" Devine said, adding: \"All the arrows point to him.\"</p>",
  "<p>Buckle your seatbelt. Make sure your nausea bag is at the ready. Because the slimiest accusation yet aimed at Barack Obama is on the verge of having its moment in the mainstream media.</p> <p>Within certain fringe elements of the anti-abortion right, it's been an article of faith for some time that Obama's support of abortion rights is so extreme that it encompasses infanticide. As in the deliberate murder of babies after they are born.</p> <p>Sorry to spoil the suspense, but it's not true. As an Illinois state senator, Obama opposed a bill that could have had the effect of outlawing abortion, thus violating <a href=\"http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=410&amp;invol=113\">Roe v Wade</a>, the landmark 1973 US supreme court decision that guarantees a woman's right to choose. More about that in a moment. But first, let's look at the swamp from which this thing emerged.</p> <p>I learned about Obama's alleged support for baby-killing a few weeks ago while perusing a local right-wing website called <a href=\"http://www.punditreview.com/2008/07/have-we-sunk-so-low-as-a-nation-that-a-self-identified-christian-could-vote-for-barack-obama/\">Pundit Review</a>. What I found, in turn, referenced <a href=\"http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=18647\">a 2006 blog post</a> for the ultraconservative website of Human Events, written by Amanda Carpenter, laying out the parameters of the accusation.</p> <p>According to Carpenter, the Illinois legislature in 2002 rejected a bill that \"would have protected babies that survived late-term abortions\", even though the wording was identical to a federal bill that passed overwhelmingly, and that was so non-controversial even <a href=\"http://www.naral.org/\">Naral Pro-Choice America</a>, the leading abortion-rights group, did not object to it. She added (accurately, unlike some of her other claims) that the Illinois bill came up for a vote twice, with Obama voting \"present\" the first time and \"no\" the second, and that he derailed the bill in committee in 2003.</p> <p>Tracing the accusation back further, I discovered that Obama's Republican opponent in his 2004 US senate race, Alan Keyes, had sought to use the issue against him, accusing Obama of supporting \"infanticide\". At what must have been a memorable news conference, according to the Chicago Sun-Times, Keyes actually said: \"Christ would not vote for Barack Obama because Barack Obama has voted to behave in a way that it is inconceivable for Christ to have behaved.\"</p> <p>Finally, I came across<a href=\"http://blogs.chicagotribune.com/news_columnists_ezorn/2004/08/index.html\"> a blog entry</a> written in August 2004 by Chicago Tribune reporter Eric Zorn, who clearly laid out the differences between the state and federal bills (scroll down to \"Apple/Orange Report\"). According to Zorn, the federal bill contained language that specified the law would do nothing to threaten a woman's right to obtain a legal abortion - language that was not included in the Illinois bill. (In other words, Amanda Carpenter's Human Events post was wrong.) Indeed, Obama said at the time that he would have voted in favour of the federal bill, but couldn't support the state bill because it appeared to be at odds with Roe v Wade.</p> <p>Please keep in mind, by the way, that all of this is much ado about nothing. Murder is a crime. The federal and state bills were purely symbolic. Infanticide remains a grave offence in Illinois, despite Obama's efforts to defeat one piece of politically charged legislation.</p> <p>Now, up to this moment in the presidential campaign, the infanticide charge has only occasionally appeared in mainstream circles. It received perhaps its most thorough airing on June 30, when <a href=\"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0806/30/sitroom.02.html\">CNN's Carol Costello looked at the charges</a> and accurately reported Obama's concern that the Illinois bill was aimed at outlawing legal abortions (see <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPZCXcTwZPY\">video</a>). But in the talking-head segment that followed, the conservative pundit William Bennett asserted, falsely, that by 2003, when Obama worked to derail the state bill in committee, the language of the two bills was identical. (The Obama campaign has <a href=\"http://factcheck.barackobama.com/factcheck/2008/06/30/washington_times_wrong_on_obam.php\">called Bennett's statement \"inaccurate\"</a>.)</p> <p>Nevertheless, the story continues to build. The liberal watchdog group Media Matters for America has already <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/items/200808020004\">called out conservative radio and television host Sean Hannity</a> for letting right-wing activist Jerome Corsi (of <a href=\"http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Swift_Boat_Veterans_for_Truth#Racist_comments_by_Jerry_Corsi_of_SBVT\">Swift Boat</a> infamy), author of <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/items/200808040005\">The Obama Nation</a>, falsely claim on Fox News that Obama favoured infanticide if a botched abortion resulted in a live birth. \"Obama's on record as let's kill the baby if that's what the mother wants,\" Corsi said.</p> <p>On the other end of the media spectrum,<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/07/us/politics/07catholics.html?ex=1375848000&amp;en=9d38a1d1963392d9&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink\"> the New York Times referred to the accusation</a> in a story this week on Obama's troubles in appealing to anti-abortion Catholics. \"Republicans are gearing up campaigns to depict Mr Obama as a radical on the question of abortion, because as a state senator in Illinois he opposed a ban on the killing of foetuses born alive,\" wrote Times reporter John Broder near the end of his article.</p> <p>In the Huffington Post this week, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/08/04/the-next-smear-against-ob_n_116891.html\">Seth Colter Walls predicted</a> that infanticide would be \"the next smear against Obama\".</p> <p>Ugly and false as this is, there is a certain cold political logic to it. Conservatives who oppose abortion rights have never quite trusted Obama's Republican opponent, John McCain, despite McCain's anti-abortion rhetoric. Nor should they. During the 2000 presidential campaign, McCain ran into trouble when he committed a gaffe - that is, he <a href=\"http://www.bartleby.com/66/73/32773.html\">spoke the truth by mistake</a> - in suggesting his then-15-year-old daughter would be allowed to <a href=\"http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/01/26/mccain.abortion/index.html\">make up her own mind</a> should she find herself with an unwanted pregnancy.</p> <p>With Republicans fearing that <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/06/26/politics/main4211650.shtml\">evangelical voters will stay home</a> this fall, accusing Obama of being soft on baby-killing could have the effect of helping McCain by depicting him as the lesser of two evils.</p> <p>But there's something else going on here, and it speaks volumes about our broken political culture. Apparently we are so divided that it seems perfectly reasonable to at least some voters that a major-party presidential candidate would support murdering newly born infants.</p> <p>Red and Blue America don't just misunderstand each other - we don't even recognise one another as having come from the same planet. All Obama can do is fight the lies and hope for the best.</p>",
  "<p>ABC News <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/Story?id=5441195\">reports</a> that former presidential candidate John Edwards has admitted to repeatedly lying during his campaign about an extramarital affair with Rielle Hunter, a 44-year-old \"novice filmmaker\". He denied the other allegation made recently in the tabloid <a href=\"http://www.nationalenquirer.com\">National Enquirer</a>, which was that he's the father of her child: he says he hasn't taken a paternity test, but can't be the father based on the timing of Ms Hunter's pregnancy. (There's been some <a href=\"http://newsbusters.org/blogs/brad-wilmouth/2008/08/06/fnc-talks-edwards-affair-media-nyt-double-standards\">grumbling</a> on the right about the media's avoidance of this story prior to Edwards's admission.)</p> <p>Marc Ambinder <a href=\"http://marcambinder.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/08/more_on_edwardss_admission.php\">reports</a>:</p> <blockquote> According to people close to the Edwardses, Elizabeth Edwards has secured a primetime speaking role at the Democratic National Convention; John Edwards, as of this point, does not, and people close to him think he will beg off and not attend the convention so as not to distract Obama. Obama aides would not say whether either Edwards is on the schedule. </blockquote> <br> <p>The reason this is more than a personal matter for the Edwardses and Ms Hunter, of course, is that had Edwards won the nomination, the revelation of this secret at a critical point in the campaign could easily have destroyed the chances of a Democratic victory. Perhaps most extraordinary is this line in the ABC report:</p> <blockquote> Edwards said his wife, Elizabeth, and others in his family became aware of the affair in 2006. </blockquote> <br> <p>So it wouldn't even have been a question of making sure Elizabeth Edwards and Ms Hunter kept quiet: before he decided to run for the presidency, various \"others\" already knew. And yet Edwards imagined he could keep it quiet all the way through a campaign for the White House? There'll be plenty of anger among former Edwards supporters this evening, presumably.</p> <p>UPDATE: Ezra Klein expresses a similar thought, only <a href=\"http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=08&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=edwards\">more eloquently</a>:</p> <blockquote> No one forces you to devote your life to national advocacy of important issues. But if you decide to do follow that path, with all the plaudits and moments of roaring applause it entails, you have to make certain sacrifices, and shoulder certain realities. Among them is that if you falter, you can harm all that you're advocating and deny help to all whom you claim to represent. I don't know if it's true that Edwards' affair started and ended in 2006, but if so, that's actually the most morally unforgivable of possible timelines. If Edwards had won in Iowa and captured the nomination, this could easily have lost him the election, and thus destroyed the country's chance at health reform, withdrawing from Iraq, and so forth. This reaches back and recasts his candidacy as an act of extraordinary selfishness. That's not to say it was conscious -- we all contain multitudes and we all compartmentalize mercilessly -- but it was gambling with the fates of the very people Edwards was running to help. </blockquote> <br>",
  "<p>Despite the recent prominence of Afghanistan in the presidential campaign, John McCain continues to only want to talk about Iraq. He mentions the supposed success of the troop surge seemingly at every opportunity \u2013 an attempt to exploit his early support of the surge as a perceived advantage over Obama, who opposed it. For example, when asked <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21134540/vp/25741286#25779945\">on the Today Show</a> last month about his absence from committee hearings on Afghanistan, McCain countered that he has visited Iraq many times, and that he was right about the surge.<br> Framing issues like Afghanistan and Pakistan in terms of Iraq has become a consistent theme for McCain. He <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/15/us/politics/15text-mccain.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin\">recently said</a>: \"It is precisely the success of the surge in Iraq that shows us the way to succeed in Afghanistan.\" To address Pakistan's troubled FATA region, he proposed strengthening local tribes, modelled on \"the strategy used successfully in Anbar and elsewhere in Iraq.\" </p> <p>The problem is that McCain's Iraq-centric rhetoric oversimplifies and misinterprets security challenges in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The notion of merely exporting the surge from Iraq to Afghanistan conflates two very different conflicts, and exaggerates the potential impact of adding troops to Afghanistan. Despite McCain's insistence, experts debate whether the surge was in fact the major contributor to a decrease in violence in Iraq. What's more, while Afghanistan is certainly under-resourced, it's not clear that the most important thing is more troops. What Afghanistan desperately needs is better coordination of all the various actors involved in the country, and a strong, accountable government that provides security, economic and educational opportunities and more. </p> <p>Similarly, while empowering tribes in FATA sounds good, FATA is <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/014/383wutvv.asp?pg=1\">a very different environment from Anbar</a>. Success was possible in Anbar because the US military was able to exploit tensions between foreign jihadis and local Sunni tribal figures and insurgents. These tensions do not exist to the same degree in FATA. The militant-controlled region has been outside the Pakistani government's reach for decades, and the distinctions between militants and local people are blurred, unlike in Iraq. Foreign militants have had such a consistent presence in the region, going back to the anti-Soviet jihad, that they have intermarried with the local population. It has also been a longstanding Pakistani state policy to support militant groups to fight against India and its allies. </p> <p>More fundamentally, by placing Iraq as the top priority, McCain neglects the critical threat in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and even undercuts his own proposals for the region. He recently acknowledged requests by military leaders in Afghanistan for <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/15/us/politics/15text-mccain.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin\">three additional brigades</a>, saying that they \"must get them\". However, McCain refuses to support a timeline for withdrawal in Iraq, despite the fact that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Michael Mullen, has said <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/02/AR2008070202010_pf.html\">there aren't enough troops</a> \"to send into Afghanistan until I have a reduced requirement in Iraq.\"</p> <p>McCain also proposes doubling the size of the Afghan national army to 160,000 troops. However, only <a href=\"http://nationalsecurity.oversight.house.gov/documents/20080618133007.pdf\">two of 105 Afghan army units</a> (pdf) are currently judged \"fully capable\", due to a shortage of military trainers that the US department of defence attributes to \"higher priority \u2026 deployments of US military personnel elsewhere, particularly Iraq.\" Nonetheless, <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/2008/04/10/mccan-the-view-diversion/\">McCain ignores the Iraq war's detrimental effects on Afghanistan</a>, saying in April: \"Afghanistan is not in trouble because of our diversion to Iraq.\" His own Iraq policies would make his Afghanistan policies infeasible, demonstrating the same lack of strategic coherence that has plagued the Bush administration's foreign policy decisions. </p> <p>Leaders from General David Petraeus to the Iraqi ambassador recognise the <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jE3rQFkgTaEtt2THc5bORgo0ubogD924227G6\">increasing prominence of Afghanistan and Pakistan</a> as the central front in the struggle against global terrorism, a front which as been cited as <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/world/articles/2008/06/11/pakistan_tribal_area_called_likely_source_of_next_attack_on_us/\">the most likely source of the next terrorist attack on the US</a>. Lest our memories be so short, the consequences of a resurgent Taliban and al-Qaida safe havens are no mystery. These are the very conditions that enabled the 9/11 attacks. America may love its war heroes, but in trying to prove that he \"know[s] how to win wars\", John McCain is putting the world's primary extremist threat on the backburner \u2013 a threat which we cannot afford to neglect any longer.</p>",
  "<p>The McCain campaign yesterday <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/08/us/politics/08mccain.html\">sent back $50,000</a> in contributions that were linked to the Jordanian business partner of Harry Sargeant, who had earned \"bundler\" status by helping to raise $500,000 for the Republican nominee.</p> <p>In addition to running successful oil and asphalt companies, Sargeant serves as finance chairman for the Florida Republican party - making this week's media scrutiny as much of a headache for him as it was for McCain. As Sargeant told the St Petersburg, Florida, newspaper today, his bundling for McCain involved reaching out to foreign-born allies:</p> <blockquote> I have Venezuelan-American partners. I have Nigerian-American partners. I reached out to my friends and said, 'Can you gather me up some checks?' </blockquote> <br> <p>Sargeant's Venezuela-based business may be on less sure footing, though...</p> <p>An oil refining company owned by Sargeant, called Trigeant, is currently suing the <a href=\"http://www.pdvsa.com/index.php?tpl=interface.en/design/home.tpl.html\">state-owned oil company</a> of Venezuela, PDVSA, for allegedly forcing it out of the asphalt market in Sargeant's home state of Florida. According to the Trigeant complaint:</p> <blockquote> PDVSA promised to provide Boscan [crude oil] to Trigeant at a fair market price in part through a long-term supply agreement executed in December 2002. However, at around the same time, there began a two-month political uprising, including a general strike of PDVSA's employees, in Venezuela. </blockquote> <br> <p>Soon after the strike, Trigeant alleges, PDVSA began dealing exclusively with its US subsidiaries, thus squeezing out other competitors. Sargeant's company claims the resulting economic hit forced the sale of a refinery it owned in Alabama and the loss of another Texas refinery to creditors.</p> <p>When you consider that McCain has deemed Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez - who tightened his control of PDVSA after the 2002 strike - a \"<a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,182437,00.html\">wacko</a>\" and a \"<a href=\"http://www.nysun.com/national/mccain-urges-bolton-approval/40260/\">two-bit dictator</a>\", Sargeant's Venezuela connection looks a bit jarring.</p> <p>But Trigeant is by no means the only major oil company dealing with Venezuela, which <a href=\"http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/oil_gas/petroleum/data_publications/company_level_imports/current/import.html\">landed at No 4</a> on the latest list of countries exporting petroleum to the US.</p> <p>And as the Public Campaign Action Fund has noted, McCain has <a href=\"http://www.campaignmoney.org/node/251303/print\">plenty of other ties</a> to oil companies that did business with the Chavez-controlled PDVSA. (Obama has eschewed oil PAC money but does take contributions from <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/obamas_oil_spill.html\">oil company employees</a>.)</p> <p>Still, the Venezuela lawsuit signals that more risky tidbits about the McCain fundraiser could keep drip-dripping into the public eye. As Sargeant himself told <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/07/AR2008080702133.html?hpid=topnews\">the Washington Post</a> when asked about another Jordanian partner who is <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/07/more-on-mccain-fund-raisers/\">now suing him</a>, \"People always make allegations in lawsuits.

  "<p>Pakistan has reached a watershed moment in its short history. For the first time in its six decades of existence, formal proceedings are in train to remove a sitting military head of state. In some respects, recent events reflect past experiences. The Pakistan supreme court has previously declared the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Khan\">Yahya Khan</a> and <a href=\"http://www.historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entity=muhammad_zia_ul-haq\">Zia ul-Haq</a> dictatorships illegal. On both occasions, however, the decisions occurred after the two men had relinquished power. The current decision to <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKISL26399620080808\">impeach Musharraf</a>, should he fail a vote of confidence in the national assembly, is somewhat unprecedented. It is a shot in the arm for the rule of law in Pakistan.</p> <p>At the same time as impeachment has been mooted in Pakistan, another, largely ignored one is being considered in the United States. Last month former presidential nominee, Dennis Kucinich, brought proceedings to impeach George Bush for orchestrating the invasion of Iraq. The Senate judiciary committee hearing his <a href=\" http://kucinich.us/impeachment/articles.pdf\">petition (pdf)</a> did not allow Kucinich to use the 'I' word, however, and the hearing is symbolic at best.</p> <p>But there remains an underlying logic to impeachment. Richard Nixon was almost impeached for clandestinely seeking to undermine his Democratic opponents (he resigned before he could be chucked out) and Bill Clinton was impeached for failing to disclose his sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky (the House of Representatives impeached him, but the Senate acquitted him, and he wasn't subsequently removed from office). It is therefore reasonable to query why impeachment proceedings against George Bush have only been countenanced so hesitantly and only now. Even at this juncture there is little support for the impeachment of George Bush from the Democrats or the media. </p> <p>It's interesting to compare the impeachment efforts in Pakistan and the US, given their stark contrasts. Pakistan is a desperately poor, lower-tier power mired in years of corruption and a recent upsurge in violence instigated in part by elements of its own military intelligence. The US, in comparison, is the wealthiest, most powerful nation on the planet. Yet it too has been mired in political corruption and economic scandals. In their own ways, the countries share an alarming addiction to military corporatism. Both Pakistan under Musharraf and the US under Bush favour military solutions to political problems.</p> <p>Nancy Pelosi, Democratic speaker of the house, <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2008/7/30/house_speaker_nancy_pelosi_defends_her\">opposes</a> impeachment because \"it would be divisive for the country\". But, \"if somebody had a crime that the president had committed,\" she mentioned flippantly on American television recently, \"that would be a different story.\" Presumably the jury is out on Iraq until photos of Bush doing the thumbs-up at Abu Ghraib are unearthed. Barack Obama has decided to steer clear of the issue entirely. His stand could be excused on account of immediate political expediency. In one sense, he has very little to gain from supporting impeachment. John McCain would get free ammunition to line up Obama for the standard unpatriotic Democrat rhetoric.</p> <p>Of course, all of this raises the question of what precisely politicians are meant to be doing if they always dodge politically risky issues. Just prior to gaining control of Congress in 2006, the Democrats raced to quash rumours that they would seek to impeach Bush. Pelosi argued, credibly, that such moves would only act as fodder for Republicans seeking to avoid likely defeat. \"Making them lame ducks is good enough for me,\" Pelosi told the 60 Minutes programme. She repeated this argument in <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1828320,00.html\">Time</a> only last week.</p> <p>Sadly, impeachment proceedings did not start after the Democratic takeover of Congress in 2006. What followed was a lame duck Democratic party consistently voting to support America's continued occupation of Iraq. It was left instead to Dennis Kucinich, the maverick congressman from Ohio, to launch independent proceedings against Bush and Dick Cheney. His efforts have been joined by a number of citizen activists that includes the man who prosecuted Charles Manson.</p> <p>Since its election <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/reuters/2008/02/20/asia/OUKWD-UK-PAKISTAN-ELECTION.php\">victory</a> in February, Pakistan's coalition government has been chided by western observers for dithering in the face of a resurgent Taliban movement. It is true that the government's two major powerbrokers, Asif Zardari and Nawaz Sharif, have largely been more interested in turf wars than mounting a consistent policy platform. And yes, the impeachment proceedings are politically motivated. Ordinary Pakistanis are hurting as the cost of fuel and basic foodstuffs increases at an alarming rate (by a <a href=\"http://www.statpak.gov.pk/depts/fbs/statistics/price_statistics/weekly_spi/report.pdf\">whopping 32% (pdf)</a> in July alone). The coalition government has been blaming Musharraf for these ills. Impeachment gives Sharif and Zardari further ammunition to stave off an electorate with little faith in them.</p> <p>But for whatever reasons, Pakistan's politicians have taken a calculated risk. If they fail it will only serve to validate Musharraf. That they decided to proceed regardless is something to celebrate. Democracies, let alone coalition governments in a country as volatile as Pakistan, are complex animals. The impeachment proceedings against Musharraf are proof that Pakistan's politicians can occasionally rise above their nation's traumas to seek accountability for a dictator who has been consistently supported by the west.</p> <p><em>This article was amended at 12:40 on Friday August 8</em></p>",
