  "<p>Regular readers have seen me cite Zack Roth's fine work at TPM before, and today he delivers <a href=\"http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/11/the_anatomy_of_a_smear.php\">a strong anatomy</a> of the roll-out of the Obama's auntie story. Here's me quoting Zack who in turns quotes the AP and then returns to the narration starting with \"In other words::</p> <blockquote> <p>But note the way in which AP seems to have obtained the information. High up in the story, it reports: </p> <p>Information about the deportation case was disclosed and confirmed by two separate sources, one a federal law enforcement official. The information they made available is known to officials in the federal government, but the AP could not establish whether anyone at a political level in the Bush administration or in the McCain campaign had been involved in its release.</p> <p>In other words, it looks like someone in the Bush administration leaked the information, with the goal of throwing a last-minute wrench into Obama's campaign. And someone else confirmed it, with similar motives.</p> <p>On the record, of course, the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, a unit of the Department of Homeland Security, is telling reporters it can't comment on any individual person's immigration status. It would appear to be a violation of department procedures, at the least, to leak such information.</p> </blockquote> <p>We'll probably never know. In the meantime, is this a big story -- the aunt's illegal status, I mean? Could make a difference of a point or two in a small number of states, I think, but in broad terms, it's no October (or November) Surprise. Which raises the broader question of why hasn't the swift-boating of Obama -- you know, the swift-boat equivalents of Ayers and Khalidi and so on -- worked its magic for the GOP the way it has in the past? This is the subject of my print column for Monday's paper. I'm sure you just can't wait!<br></p>",

Awkwardly, however, McCain's use of Khalidi in his campaigning seems to have triggered a concerted effort to purchase copies of the professor's largely well-received book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807003093?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ezrkle-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0807003093\">The Iron Cage: The Story Of The Palestinian Struggle For Statehood</a>, which is now at 122 in Amazon.com's ranking of all books sold.

And we have such low voter turnout compared to a lot of countries,\" he said.</p> <p>It's worth noting that voter turnout has been steadily increasing in last few elections, and this year some secretaries of state predict that <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0308/9196.html\">80% of registered voters could vote</a>, and nationally, more than 60% of eligible voters are expected to cast a ballot, which would surpass the <a href=\"http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/article.php?id=LJS2008102301\">high water mark for modern elections</a> in 1960, according to the political scientist Larry Sabato.</p> <p><strong>Lawyers already involved</strong></p> <p>This is the first election in several years that Andrew won't be working as a poll worker or precinct judge, and he had intended to vote on election day because he hasn't been able to in the past.</p> <p>\"I got so anxious about the election that I voted early with a paper ballot,\" he said.

People didn't know what form of identification they needed in order to vote. People had moved and had outdated identification and didn't know whether they needed to vote provisionally. Provisional balloting was meant to ensure that everyone could cast a vote, but it's turned into a complicating factor in elections that leaves them open to legal challenges.</p> <p>\"It wasn't necessarily any concerted effort [to deny people the right to vote], but the rules have become so confusing that your average voter, poll worker or even precinct judges don't fully understand what the guidelines are on whether someone can vote,\" he said.</p> <p>Andrew thinks there is an \"incredibly high chance\" that the result in Ohio will be challenged legally. The election process already has been in court. Republicans have sued over voter registration drives in Ohio. The Republican party challenged <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/09/28/politics/main4483617.shtml?source=RSSattr=U.S._4483617\">same-day voter registration and early voting in Ohio</a>, and a Columbus-based think tank filed a <a href=\"http://brainshavings.com/2008/10/rico-suit-filed-against-acorn.html\">lawsuit against Acorn calling on the organisation to be dissolved</a> for submitting fradulent voter registration applications. The American Civil Liberties Union sued one county in an effort to force election officials to accept the same-day voter registrations.</p> <p>In terms of Republicans' accusations of fraud, Andrew pointed out something that many Democrats have in terms of the lawsuits against Acorn. This is registration fraud, not voter fraud, he said. Voter registrations under the name Mickey Mouse or members of American football teams are being caught. \"People are not voting under these names,\" he said. \"Registering under Mickey Mouse and being caught by the secretary of state is exactly how the system is supposed to work.\"</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidmiliband\">David Miliband</a> today said he had held a \"good meeting\" with the president of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/congo\">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> during an emergency visit to the war-torn country.</p> <p>The foreign secretary and his French counterpart, Bernard Kouchner, met Joseph Kabila for about an hour and a half in the Congolese capital, Kinshasa.</p> <p>The two were due to continue on to the eastern town of Goma on the Rwandan border, where a ceasefire continued to hold after violence earlier this week. Later, they will travel to the Rwandan capital, Kigali, for talks with the country's leader, Paul Kagame.</p> <p>\"We had a good meeting ... The key theme of our discussion has been the need to implement the agreements that have already been made,\" Miliband said after the meeting, according to the AFP news agency.</p> <p>\"Around the world, people are seeing the makings of a humanitarian crisis and it's vital that politics is used to reverse a further round of deaths and killings.\"</p> <p>In Goma, tension remained high amid a fragile ceasefire as Tutsi rebel troops led by General Laurent Nkunda laid siege at the doorstep of the capital of Nord Kivu province.</p> <p>Government forces abandoned Goma on Wednesday as the rebels advanced, leaving just 850 United Nations peacekeepers between Nkunda's forces and Goma.</p> <p>Miliband and Kouchner arrived in Congo as Gordon Brown, the prime minister, spoke of his fears of a developing humanitarian disaster in the region.</p> <p>\"My worry is about the thousands of people being displaced at the moment by the violence that is taking place,\" Brown said.</p> <p>Aid agencies and the UN have warned of impending disaster for thousands of people caught up in the fighting between the Congolese army and the rebel force, which is backed by neighbouring Rwanda's Tutsi leadership.</p> <p>The UN refugee agency said it had received credible reports that rebels had looted and burned camps for displaced people. \"We are extremely concerned about the fate of some 50,000 displaced people living in these camps, which include the UNHCR-administered sites of Dumez, Nyongera and Kasasa,\" the spokesman Ron Redmond said.</p> <p>An estimated 1 million people have been forced from their homes in North Kivu, a province of 5 million that borders Rwanda, after two years of violence. The former Belgian colony, which is rich in copper, cobalt, gold and diamonds, was at war from 1998 until 2003. Around 220,000 people have been displaced since the latest round fighting broke out in August.</p> <p>Referring to the Goma peace accord reached in January this year, Kouchner said today: \"We do not have to redefine the peace protocol ... That has already been done.\"</p> <p>Under the agreement, which has not been implemented, a ceasefire would be enforced and all armed groups in the region would be disarmed.</p> <p>The junior foreign minister, Lord Malloch Brown, said today that Britain might need to send troops to the area if talks failed. He said the UK and other European powers could not stand back if the fighting between government and rebel forces erupted again.</p> <p>\"We have certainly got to have it [a British force] as an option which is developed and on the table if we need it,\" he told the BBC. He, however, stressed that the deployment of EU troops was a last option if all else failed.</p> <p>Charities have warned that unless supplies reach refugees hundreds could be at risk of dying of starvation and disease. Save the Children said today that a team, including health and nutrition experts, was back in Goma after being withdrawn earlier this week and was making an emergency assessment of the needs of the displaced there.</p> <p>\"The ceasefire around Goma seems to be holding and we are taking advantage of the precarious lull in the fighting to attempt to assess the situation so that we can target those in need with emergency feeding and clean water. We need to find out who is where and in what numbers so that we can help them,\" said the spokesman Dominic Nutt.</p>",

  "<p>Peggy Noonan <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122539802263585317.html\">appears to have made her peace</a> with Obama and even goes so far as to muse:</p> <blockquote> <p>But let's be frank. Something new is happening in America. It is the imminent arrival of a new liberal moment. History happens, it makes its turns, you hold on for dear life. Life moves.</p> <p>A fitting end for a harem-scarem, rock-'em-sock-'em shakeup of a year -- one of tumbling inevitabilities, torn coalitions, striking new personalities.</p> <p>Eras end, and begin. \"God is in charge of history.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>This, if I may wax self-referential for a moment, is the meta-question: will Tuesday indeed mark the beginning of a new liberal era? I posed this question in a slightly different way back on October 22, 2007 in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/oct/22/comment.uselections2008\">a piece I did</a> for the print version:</p> <blockquote> <p>For example, the British election of 1945 confirmed a desire among voters for social reform so profound that it swept aside a great national hero. Similarly - except in the other direction ideologically - American voters made a statement in 1980 when they voted Ronald Reagan into the White House by a landslide proportion, signalling that one era was over and another one dawning.</p> <p>Will 2008 be such a year? The question is on the minds and tongues of many in Washington. Liberals hope that the answer is yes, while conservatives fear that it is (and conservatives seem more uniformly pessimistic than liberals seem optimistic).</p> <p>But how might we know that 2008 is such a year? Let me offer what I think is the most important undercurrent question of next year's election: have Americans tired of conservatism, or have they merely tired of corrupt and incompetent conservatism?...</p> <p>...The rubber will hit the road next summer and autumn. Then the Republicans will tell voters that the Democratic nominee has proposed trillions of dollars' worth of new programmes and will inevitably raise taxes to pay for them. The Democrat will need to stand her or his ground and, while obviously not being cavalier about taxes, present a vision of a different kind of society. There are signs that 51% of the voters may be ready to embrace it.</p> </blockquote> <p>First of all -- not bad for a year ago, if I do say so myself! More importantly: yes, it does seem that we are reaching the end of the era of conservative dominance in American politics that arrived with Ronald Reagan in 1980.</p> <p>But unlike Noonan, I don't necessarily think that the end of a conservative era perforce means the beginning of a liberal one. There's something in between -- a transitional period during which the public seems willing to give liberal Democratic governance a second chance, after the well-documented failures of the 1970s, but is not quite yet ready to embrace that possibility with both arms.</p> <p>Even if Obama wins pretty handily, I still smell a difference between 1980 and 2008. In 1980, a strong majority of voters really did embrace Reagan and conservatism. Today I think the embrace isn't quite as strong. Obama and Democratic congressional majorities, if elected, will have to earn the trust and confidence of voters in the middle over time. As I spent last week telling audiences on our speaking tour, I think it's two or four years too early to declare this a new liberal era.</p> <p>Meanwhile, my 2007 piece also suggests what I think is one of the crucial errors of the McCain campaign. He should have distanced himself from Bush not on policy, but on the issue of competence. He should have blasted the mishandling of the war and the economy and Katrina and drilled home a message that went something like, \"You, average voter, still trust our positions. You still want lower taxes and an aggressive foreign policy. You just want everything done competently. I understand that, and that's how I'll govern.\" If, today, the talking heads were framing the race as a choice between liberalism and a more disciplined and competent conservatism, I think McCain would have a better chance of winning.<br></p>",

At the time, Blackwell was also serving a state co-chair of George W Bush's re-election campaign.</p> <p>This year, many Ohio voters seem determined not to be burned again. In their corner is a new secretary of state, the Democrat Jennifer Brunner, who has already fended off <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2008/10/9/ohio_secretary_of_state_jennifer_brunner\">a series of Republican efforts at vote suppression</a>. But thanks to a state law passed in 2006, Ohioans also have a new weapon in the fight to make sure their votes are counted: their state is now among more than 30 states that allow residents to vote early - either in person or by absentee ballot - on demand, without having to provide an excuse. In Ohio, <a href=\"http://www.alternet.org/democracy/101040/early_voting_in_ohio_begins/\">early voting began a full month prior to election day</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/thenumbers/2008/10/new-direction-v.html\">ABC news estimated yesterday</a> that one in six eligible voters across the country had already cast ballots, and a full 35% of voters were expected to do so before election day. The sheer volume of early votes is huge, reflecting the large increase in registration. And so far, these votes are breaking heavily in favor of Obama, 59% to 40%.</p> <p>These numbers are almost a <a href=\"http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081030/POLITICS01/810300361\">mirror image of the previous two elections</a>, where George W Bush won about 60% of early votes. Traditionally, it's older people who are most likely to vote early, but that too has changed this year. Voters of all kinds now speak of being suspicious of the voting process and wary of problems on election day. Particularly in areas plagued by such problems in the past, people are flocking to the polls early or sending in their ballots through the mail.</p> <p>The Obama campaign has mounted a massive get-out-the-early-vote effort that so far has no equivalent on the Republican side, and dozens of non-partisan groups are participating as well.</p> <p>The Guardian team encountered one such group in Columbus, Ohio, where an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 people were unable to vote in 2004 due to long lines and problems with registration data and electronic voting machines. <a href=\"http://www.votefromhome08.com/index.html\">Vote from Home</a>, staffed mainly by student volunteers, has set itself a goal of bringing in 10,000 early ballots. They are focusing especially on those most likely to have been disenfranchised in the past: the poor, inner city minorities, homeless people, and felons (who under Ohio law are allowed to vote after they serve their time).</p> <p>The group has helped register people, and now makes about a thousand phone calls a day to remind voters to cast their ballots. They also provide a free taxi service to the polls. They hope their work will ensure that no one has to wait more than a couple of hours to vote.</p> <p>Obstacles to voting probably changed the outcome of the presidential election in 2000, and possibly in 2004 as well. This army of volunteers is doing all it can to ensure that in 2008, Americans will elect the president they have chosen to elect. In an ideal America, of course, the government would provide adequate resources and safeguards to this all-important civic process, and groups like Vote from Home wouldn't have to exist at all. But in the imperfect America we inhabit today, this is what democracy looks like.</p>",

But in order to get through each day, Vickie Castro had to struggle to block the thought from her mind, and keep the fear at bay. That all ended when she saw the man in the neatly pressed uniform with all the medals on his chest coming to the door.</p> <p>The officer knew what to do. He waited patiently until the screaming stopped. And then said: \"I regret to inform you\u2026\" Vicki begins to cry as she tells the Guardian's Dan Glaister of the moment when she learned that her son, Army Spc Jonathan Castro, had been killed in Mosul, Iraq.</p> <p>That was almost four years ago, when Jonathan was serving his second tour of duty on a \"stop-loss\" order, which required him to stay in the service beyond his initial enlistment. He was 21 years old when he died.</p> <p>Neither Vickie nor anyone else in her family opposes the war for political reasons. Her son wanted to be a soldier. But the young combat engineer came to believe that the United States should not be in Iraq. Still, he continued to do his duty and serve his country. Vickie mentions that she distrusts John McCain, but says all that matters to her now is that the government brings the troops home.</p> <p>Today, like so many families, the Castros are left with an empty room - empty, except for a collection of photographs, a proudly displayed American flag, and a mother who each day relives the precious moments of her son's life.</p>",

Vote for one.\" It's so strange, though, to watch those famous scenes of McCain the prisoner-of-war one last time, and to reflect on how that episode of enormous personal courage could have formed the basis of a powerful, disciplined, lofty campaign, based on the candidate's character. Instead, he exploited it so relentlessly -- while revealing so much more about his character that was rather less admirable -- that he ended up looking whiny, as if he was asking not to be respected for his service, but rewarded for it with the highest office in the land. And despite the fact that this is a pretty good ad, that sense of self-absorption is present here, too: it's still all about him, in a political and economic climate when that just doesn't seem like the right tone to strike.</p> <p>UPDATE: As my colleague Richard Adams points out, adopting that slogan sooner might actually have helped Obama by buying into the Democrat's framing of the election -- something Hillary Clinton tried with the \"change\" concept. As did McCain, of course, with \"that's not change you can believe in, my friends...\"</p>",

  "<p>In Saul Bellow's novel Herzog the tormented intellectual protagonist addresses one of his many letters to Adlai Stevenson, the unsuccessful Democratic candidate for president in 1952 and 1960. \"Dear Governor Stevenson,\" Herzog begins, \"I supported you in 1952. Like many others I thought this country might be ready for its great age in the world and intelligence at last assert itself in public affairs.\"</p> <p>Bellow, who briefly considered writing a biography of Stevenson, is expressing the faith that so many writers in postwar America invested in - yes, another cerebral politician from Illinois. John Kenneth Galbraith and Arthur Schlesinger Jr were among the \"eggheads\" who hoped that Stevenson would inaugurate a new era in America, or at least check the forces of philistinism and conformity unleashed by McCarthy-style anti-communism and what President Eisenhower himself called the \"military-industrial complex\".</p> <p>But Stevenson's witty phrases - New Dealers, he warned, might be replaced by car dealers in Ike's America - and obvious erudition did not persuade the great American public. He lost both elections by a landslide to the affable general, who won, as Herzog put it, \"because he expressed low-grade universal potato love\".</p> <p>Appalled by eight years of cultural and political sterility, during which car-dealing Rabbits proliferated in suburbia, many American writers and intellectuals fixed on John F Kennedy as their saviour. The Harvard-educated president, who authored a Pulitzer-winning book, eagerly reciprocated their attention, seeking out the company of Norman Mailer and Tennessee Williams, though he preferred to read Ian Fleming. Attending a White House dinner, Robert Lowell noted that only Edmund Wilson among the writers present wasn't \"addled with adulation\". Asked by the president about his book Patriotic Gore (whose preface derides the US government's perennially high \"moral justification for war\"), Wilson told Kennedy to read it for himself.</p> <p>Nearly half a century later another young candidate for president has charmed many writers out of political despair and indifference. Philip Roth, Michael Chabon, Jonathan Raban, Jhumpa Lahiri, John Updike ... the endorsements, both explicit and not, for Barack Obama keep rolling in, and it is easy to understand why. Emerging in the wake of an intellectually and morally numb administration, Obama not only seems a providential intervention in American politics. He is also a writer of great skill and emotional power, as his memoir Dreams from My Father makes clear. </p> <p>\"You would be surprised,\" the young JFK was informed by his ambitious father, \"how a book that really makes the grade with high-class people stands you in good stead for years to come.\" But nothing in Dreams from My Father hints at such up-market self-promotion, or indeed at the ghost-writer who actually authored JFK's Pulitzer-winning book Profiles of Courage. Rather, its taut, sharp sentences reveal a remarkable capacity for self-examination and a finely developed negative capability; and its frank confessions of doubt and ambiguity make it possible to see Obama's paeans to American exceptionalism as election-time expediency. </p> <p>Shorn of his political rhetoric, Obama appears to be a writer possessed of the sense - which Sarah Palin might call \"un-American\" - of the tragic limit and unpredictability of human action. And for writers who dream of wielding a transformative power with their work, watching one of their kind ascend to the West Wing is undoubtedly thrilling. It seems that, as Herzog hoped, intelligence finally has a chance of asserting itself in public affairs. But the odds against its success are still enormous.</p> <p>JFK's own career cautions against excessive faith in brainy politicians offering change from the extremely isolated office of the American presidency. Early death at the hands of an enigmatically lone assassin has shrouded his reputation in a \"what could have been\" mist. But Kennedy never broke free of the many stultifying compulsions of postwar America's affluence and power, including the obligation to look and act tough. In fact, he struck more pugnacious postures than even his Texan successor, whose assault on Vietnam quickly deprived the Democratic party of its literary-intellectual fan base. In the presidential election in 1960, Kennedy attacked his opponent Nixon from the right. As president he almost sparked armageddon with his grandstanding during the Cuban missile crisis, and irreversibly militarised American involvement in Vietnam. (In the process, he expedited the political education of at least one of his literary admirers, Gore Vidal: a brutal disabusing that today feels a blessing to readers of Vidal's clear-sighted essays.)</p> <p>Obama, too, will be the president of a deeply conservative country, which was persuaded to choose a black intellectual over a war hero and hockey mom only by the fear of economic collapse, and which the overall decline in national fortunes is likely to push to the rancorous right after next week's lurch to the moderate centre. Indeed, Obama's own tough talk about taking the supposedly \"good\" war in Afghanistan to Pakistan - part of a JFK-style rhetorical offensive from the right - is likely to trap him into a disastrous course of action. Not surprisingly, last month's fundraiser for Obama attended by Salman Rushdie, Jhumpa Lahiri, Kiran Desai and other writers of Indian origin did not attract any writers from Pakistan, one of the countries laid waste by the \"war on terror\", whose many false assumptions Obama seems unable to abandon even as he points to its failed strategies. </p> <p>Like Adlai Stevenson and JFK, Obama appeals subliminally to a powerless intelligentsia at least partly because he appears, with his superior intelligence, wit and learning, to hold himself aloof from the dingy realm of politics. But he'll soon no longer be able to afford much writerly idealism. </p> <p>\"By definition,\" Camus wrote, a writer \"cannot serve today those who make history .. . he must serve those who are subject to it.\" Certainly, moral imagination of the kind Obama seems to possess - one solicitous of the victims of history - has no deadlier foe than the mammoth apparatus of centralised power he will soon preside over. Those who avidly await Obama's political apotheosis next week must now also brace themselves for the melancholy spectacle of a promising writer's swift decline.</p>",
  "<p>It's fitting that the cynicism \"vote early and vote often\" is commonly attributed to Chicago's Democratic boss, mayor Richard Daley, who famously voted the graveyards in 1960 to help put John Kennedy in the White House. In this 2008 race, it's the American media that have voted very early and often. They long ago elected the star graduate of Chicago's Democratic machine, Barack Obama. </p> <p>I am not talking of editorials in newspapers, though Obama has the preponderance of the endorsements over John McCain. Obama certainly deserves the credit for recruiting impressive advisers and running a more efficient campaign machine than any one in the US's political history. </p> <p>What's troubling to anyone old-fashioned enough to care about standards in journalism is the news coverage in mainstream media. Forget the old notions of objectivity, fairness, thoroughness, and so on. The nastiest rumours on both sides haven't been published, but the coverage has been slavishly on the side of \"the one\". </p> <p>It has not just been anti-Republican. It goes without saying that after eight years of George Bush's macho blunders, the disenchantment of even the conservative outlets was bound to show. Researchers at the Project for Excellence in Journalism report that in the six weeks since the Republican convention, McCain, once the darling of the media, got four times as many negative stories as positive ones. Meanwhile, Obama got twice as many positive stories as McCain. The website Politico has also acknowledged that it had loaded the dice against McCain: 100 stories were more favourable to Obama than McCain; 69 were the opposite.</p> <p>But the press bias towards Obama doesn't represent a simple revulsion for the Republican party. It was on display in the Democratic primaries with the persecution of Hillary Clinton. Worst of all, in the primaries, the press let the Obama campaign get away with continuous insinuations below the radar that the Clintons were race-baiters. Instead of exposing that absurd defamation for what it was - a nasty smear - the media sedulously propagated it.</p> <p>Clinton made the historically correct and uncontroversial remark that civil rights legislation came about from a fusion of the dreams of Dr Martin Luther King and the legislative follow-through by President Lyndon Johnson. The New York Times misrepresented that as a disparagement of King, twisting her remarks to imply that \"a black man needed the help of a white man to effect change\". This was one of a number of manipulations on race by the Obama campaign, amply documented by the leading Democratic historian, Princeton's Sean Wilentz. Clinton came close to tears in a coffee shop in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, which many thought helped her to win an upset victory there. MSNBC television gave a platform to the Chicago congressmen, Jesse Jackson Jr, where he questioned her tears and claimed that she'd not shed any tears for the black victims of Katrina, and that she'd pay for that in the South Carolina primary, where 45% of the electorate would be African-Americans. </p> <p>In fact, MSNBC ran a non-stop campaign for Obama propelled by the misogyny of its anchors, Chris Matthews, Keith Olbermann and David Shuster. Chelsea Clinton joining Clinton's campaign prompted Shuster to report she was \"pimping\" for her mother. </p> <p>Obamania has not been deflated one bit by the non-stop talkers on rightwing radio. They offer vituperation in place of enlightenment; paranoia in place of policies, and as such have little influence with the crucial independents. </p> <p>On the web, the rightwing Drudge Report highlights anything that favours McCain, the Huffington Post does the same for Obama, and the more independent Slate has said only one of its staff intends to vote for McCain, the other 55 for Obama. Fox News has the vehement Sean Hannity paired with the mildly liberal Alan Colmes, not a fair match, but it has been more willing to investigate than CNN. In the Democratic primaries, there was a pattern on CNN where the short news videos of Clinton rarely let you hear what she was saying, but the short news videos of Obama let his words come through. I mentioned this to a CNN editor who said, \"Oh, that's our young video editors, they just find Obama more exciting.\" </p> <p>The young and affluent liberals have been captivated by Obama's charisma, the unstated notion that electing a black man will be absolution for the years of discrimination and prejudice, and the expectation that Obama's undoubted appeal to the outside world will repair America's image. All understandable, but these emotions have been allowed to swamp the commonplace imperatives of journalism: curiosity and scepticism. </p> <p>All the mainstream national outlets were extraordinarily slow to check Obama's background. And until it became inescapable because of a video rant, they wouldn't investigate the Reverend Jeremiah Wright connection for fear of being accused of racism. They wouldn't explore Obama's dealing with the corrupt, now convicted, Chicago businessman Tony Rezko. They haven't investigated Obama's pledge to get rid of the secret ballot in trade union affairs. After years of inveighing against \"money in politics\", they've tolerated his breach of the pledge to restrict himself to public financing as McCain has done (to his cost). Now the LA Times refuses to release a possibly compromising video, which shows Obama praising Palestinian activist Rashid Khalidi at a 2003 banquet, saying its promises to its source prevent it from doing so.</p> <p>The British press is notorious for political distortions, which more or less balance out. But the American press likes to think of itself as more superior and detached than it actually is. In 2000, the mainstream media did a great deal to elect George Bush by portraying Al Gore as a boastful liar. </p> <p>Let's hope the consequences of electing \"the one\" will be as wondrous as the press has led the voters to believe. </p> <p>\u2022 Harold Evans is former editor of the Times and the Sunday Times, and author of The American Century</p>",
  "<p>Every United States presidential election is important. Most of them provide dramatic political theatre. All of them are compulsively watched by the rest of the world. The election of 2008, however, is a record-breaker in all departments. It is important because it comes at the end of George Bush's calamitous two terms and amid such economic turmoil. It is memorable because it has involved so many ground-breaking candidates and long campaigns on both sides. And it has been watched and experienced by the world as no American election has been before. Not since the Kennedy era has such a contest resonated so potently with so many people in America and beyond, including in this country. But the circumstances of this year's contest, the character of the protagonists and the immediacy of the internet age combine to mean that the 2008 election is likely to make a defining statement about America for this global generation that may eclipse even the impact of the contest of 1960.</p> <p><strong>World interest</strong></p> <p>Though we lack the vote, this is our election too. Such statements outrage many Americans and inspire others. But the rest of the world has not just lived this election. Our life chances and societies will also be shaped by what happens next Tuesday. The world has an interest in the outcome because, in spite of everything, America remains the world's pre-eminent military, political, financial and cultural power. America's standing in the world has been damaged during the Bush years. He has inflicted massive direct harm to many parts of the world through his military actions, has set back the quality of life on our planet by his indifference to climate change, international cooperation and the rule of law. He has been anti-Americanism's best recruiting sergeant and al-Qaida's too.</p> <p>The world may not have the vote on Tuesday. But it certainly has a candidate. That candidate is Senator Barack Obama. If the world could vote on November 4, Mr Obama would win by a landslide. Polling shows him preferred in Egypt by two to one, in Poland by three to one, in Canada by five to one, in Brazil by six to one, in Britain by seven to one, in France by 11 to one and in Kenya by more than 17 to one. </p> <p>He is not just the preferred choice of liberal Europeans. He is also the choice of the rest of the world, of all races and creeds - and of young people in particular. No buses crammed with lawyers would be needed to validate the accuracy of these votes. He commands this support, not only because he is not George Bush but because he personifies so much of what the world still admires about America. Americans ought to think about that. The world longs, perhaps unrealistically but palpably nevertheless, for a new America. Only Mr Obama can provide that.</p> <p>John McCain manifestly would not do this. Eight years ago, Mr McCain offered himself as a punchy and principled alternative to Mr Bush. The McCain of 2008 has been very different. He has made too many compromises with the social conservative wing of his party and in the last few weeks has run a partisan campaign in an attempt to re-energise the Republican faithful. His response to the economic crisis triggered by the credit crunch and the collapse of Lehman Brothers has been parlous. His party faces a bitter and enduring self-examination if it loses next week.</p> <p>By choosing Sarah Palin as his running mate, he made a huge error of both tactical and strategic judgment. Mrs Palin may have entranced the celebrity-driven parts of the media, but she has relentlessly alienated American voters, nearly 60% of whom now believe that she is not qualified to be the nation's vice-president. Mr McCain has made much of his experience and readiness to lead, but in this campaign he has been found lamentably wanting. </p> <p>When the 2008 campaign began, Mr Obama stood for two things. He was against the Iraq war and he was in favour of a break with the embattled partisan politics of America's recent past. He was the candidate offering hope and change. He is still all those things today, but he has become much more than that. Over the past 20 months he has been tested in debate, in campaigning skills, and on policy. At each turn he has responded with enviable coolness and clarity of judgment and language, while developing a detailed programme of commitments on the issues that would shape his presidency - healthcare, economic restoration, the federal budget, energy and Iraq.</p> <p>His performance in the televised debates was formidable, showcasing the discipline that has been such a feature of his campaign. He has responded well to the financial crisis, after a cautious start. In his 30-minute campaign infomercial this week, he reiterated the key pledges that he has made throughout this campaign, with a radical sustainable energy programme as a hallmark. Attacked by the Republicans as a redistributionist and a socialist, he has held his ground, insisting that America needs to be a fairer society. </p> <p><strong>High expectations</strong></p> <p>The voters may give the Democrats a clean sweep in Congress and the White House next week. Expectations will be high, hard to manage, and the honeymoon may not last. Yet Mr Obama will be in an enviable position. He will have the political space to write a new chapter for centre-left American governance. His election would mark the end of the conservative era that began under Ronald Reagan and which so inhibited the Democrats of the 1980s and 90s. His race is part of his appeal, and if he is elected it will mark a historic moment in American public life. But it is not, in the end, the central question next week. Mr Obama's greatest achievement is to have seized on the failures of the Republican era and to have developed a serious new progressive coalition and programme. America stands on the threshold of a new era. That is what the nation needs and the world craves, and Americans should elect Barack Obama as their president.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama's team demonstrated its confidence of victory by yesterday announcing it is to extend its campaign deep into the Republican heartland, even into John McCain's home state Arizona.</p> <p>While warning against complacency, Obama's campaign manager, David Plouffe, yesterday told reporters he was \"thrilled\" by the support for the Democratic candidate among early voters. \"The die is being cast as we speak,\" he said. \"We think we have built up an advantage in all the states, so that Senator McCain on election day is not just going to have to carry the day, but carry it convincingly.\"</p> <p>But McCain's camp, defiant of Obama's poll leads and the US media, which has all but written him off, claimed McCain was on the verge of a surprise result.</p> <p>\"We're pretty jazzed up about what we're seeing,\" his campaign manager, Rick Davis, told reporters. \"We are witnessing, I believe, one of the greatest comebacks since John McCain won the primary.\"</p> <p>With strong Democratic turnout in early voting, Obama's team expects to hold all the states that John Kerry won in 2004 and add Republican states from Colorado to Virginia. They are to advertise in Arizona for the first time, and are putting fresh resources into Georgia and North Dakota. The decision to target Arizona may be designed to try to spook McCain, who has not campaigned in his home state, assuming it was solid. Florida, one of the states that has decided past elections, remains too close to call.</p> <p>Plouffe described the Obama campaign as building to a crescendo this weekend, with 1.4 million volunteers in 770 offices. Early voting figures have raised their hopes of taking Georgia, which has been a no-go area for Democrats. Obama was set to take a break from campaigning last night to take his daughters out for Halloween, but he is due to visit eight states in a final burst of campaigning before election day on November 4, and Al Gore yesterday made an emotional return to Florida, where his hopes for the White House evaporated in the 2000 elections.</p> <p>The McCain camp, meanwhile, is diverting resources to a last-minute advertising blitz. Mike DuHaime, a McCain adviser, said canvassers had contacted 5.3 million potential voters over the last week, either by phone or in person, compared with 1.9 million at the same stage in 2004. McCain will spend the weekend canvassing in Virginia and New Hampshire. DuHaime disputed a poll in the New York Times suggesting McCain's running mate, Sarah Palin, was a drag on his campaign - with 59% saying she was not ready to be president. He said she had attracted 20,000 to a rally on Thursday, in contrast with 800 for Obama's running mate, Joe Biden.</p> <p>But a longtime McCain ally and former Republican cabinet member, Lawrence Eagleburger, speaking on National Public Radio on Thursday was categorical in saying Palin was not up for the job.</p>",
  "<p>So as we reach the finish line: John McCain's pollster declares himself satisfied that the race is functionally tied in the important states; Barack Obama says \"we're winning\"; while liberals across the US speak fretfully in the subjunctive tense, daring not to tempt fate by saying anything like \"when Obama is president\".</p> <p>Are the liberal caution and the McCain quasi-optimism actually warranted? Is there any way the Republican could still win this thing?</p> <p>The answer mathematically is... yes, he could. And it needn't even hinge on eking out a win in Pennsylvania. </p> <p>Consider the following electoral-college permutations. Obama wins all the states John Kerry won in 2004, for 252 electoral votes, along with Iowa and New Mexico, two states where he appears to be comfortably ahead and would add 12 to his total for 264 (270 is needed to win). But suppose it stops there and every other battleground state tumbles toward McCain - Ohio and Florida, where Obama's leads are fairly narrow, but also Virginia and Colorado, where his leads are larger but not insurmountable. These are, after all, states that are long accustomed to backing the Republican candidate. In this scenario, McCain wins 274-264.</p> <p>Let's go it one better. Say McCain does manage a victory in Pennsylvania, where his campaign is circulating fliers comparing him to Hillary Clinton, that seductress of the state's oft-limned blue-collar voters. If he did snare that state's 21 electoral votes, McCain could then afford to lose Virginia (13) and Colorado (nine). Still holding Ohio, Florida etc, he would win 273-265.</p> <p>Let's try one final scenario. Penn-sylvania ends up in the Obama column, as does Colorado. But McCain's pollster has recent spoken of mysterious \"internal numbers\" showing Iowa (seven votes) to be somewhat up for grabs. So an electoral cocktail that includes Iowa and Virginia but not Pennsylvania or Colorado would give McCain 272 electoral votes and the presidency.</p> <p>Though mathematically possible, how likely are any of these scenarios?</p> <p>Throughout this election, I've relied most regularly on the websites RealClearPolitics and fivethirtyeight.com for polling averages, so let's see what they have to say about the margins in these states as of yesterday. In Pennsylvania, both have Obama ahead by 9.8%. Making up 10% in four days would be a remarkable feat, though not unheard of. Obama is six points ahead in Virginia and Colorado, and has a 11% lead in Iowa. Now let's recall that all the above scenarios are possible only if McCain wins Ohio. In what we call the Buckeye state, the websites have Obama ahead by about 5%.</p> <p>McCain doesn't have a lead in any major poll in any of these states. He would truly need a tsunami to hit that would shift the race in his direction by five to 10 points in the final days - a swing very nearly without precedent. </p> <p>But still, Obama supporters' emotional continuum runs from cautious to outright neurotic. Liberal election anxiety is grounded in the hard experiences of 2000 and 2004. We tend to assume that any mention by the Republicans of \"taxes\", \"terrorism\" and \"socialism\" will send middle America dashing fearfully into their arms. We suspect that those same Americans will wake next Tuesday morning and say to themselves: \"It's just now dawned on me that that fellow is black; I can't possibly vote for him.\"</p> <p>The former hasn't happened, and the latter is increasingly implausible. As the days dwindle down to a precious few, as Maxwell Anderson put it, caution is well-advised. But neurosis would seem to be an indulgence. It's a good thing that the candidate himself doesn't suffer from it.</p> <p>\u2022 Read Michael Tomasky's blog and watch his video commentary at theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Wednesday November 5 2008.

  "<p>The day we brought my new-born son home to our Brooklyn apartment, an article in the New York Times pointed out that \"a black male who drops out of high school [in the US] is 60 times more likely to find himself in prison than one with a bachelor's degree\". These are the kind of statistics I often quote in my work. But this time it was personal. Looking down at him as he snoozed in the brand new car seat, I thought: \"Those are not great odds. I'd better buy some more children's books.\"</p> <p>Over the next few weeks, as we fumbled with the nappies, pram, barfing and burping, a new, previously unthinkable option for black American males emerged: the presidency of the United States. Osceola was born on the weekend Barack Obama declared his candidacy. This prompted conversations that I would not have had otherwise. His success, I was told, would signify great things for my son. Osceola would grow up with an assumption that the highest office in the land was open to him. That the future could be his. That there was, I was told, nothing that this child could not achieve. </p> <p>Back in February 2007, when Obama announced his candidacy, this never made much sense to me. The fact that my son suddenly has a tiny theoretical chance of getting to the White House is less important than the more real chance of his ending up behind bars (one in three black American boys born in 2001 will do so) or dead (three black kids are shot every day). I wanted a president who could change the odds for the many rather than raise the stakes for a few. I didn't care what they looked like. It wasn't that I didn't understand the symbolic importance of his bid. I just did not want to mistake it for substance.</p> <p>On a political level, I have always thought he was interesting. Obama's announcement came 18 months after hurricane Katrina put black America's collective deprivation and individual success clearly on display. One man can rise to the presidency and a whole community can sink into the Gulf of Mexico: anything, I thought, really is possible. And with three days to go before election day, it looks like the US stands on the verge of making the historic decision to put a black man in the White House.</p> <p>This was no reflection on Obama. Everything I'd heard about him - not least his opposition to the Iraq war at a time when such a position was unpopular - was impressive. But his two years in the Senate suggested he was pretty mainstream and even, at times, a little suspect. He'd supported Joseph Lieberman (a Democrat who is now supporting John McCain) in his primary Senate campaign against an anti-war campaigner. And he voted to confirm Condoleezza Rice as secretary of state. It wasn't obvious to me that he would be any better than some other generic Democrat with different pigmentation. The idea that his presidency would mean anything for Osceola's life never really crossed my mind.</p> <p>To express such scepticism before many Obama supporters was to be accused of cynicism. The true believers do not just want you to drink the Kool Aid. They demand that you chug it.</p> <p>The people my scepticism vexed most were white liberals. Obama had become prey to the soft bigotry of unreasonable expectations. Describing the crowd's reaction to him in Rockford, Illinois, Time's Joe Klein noted: \"The African Americans tend to be fairly reserved ... The white people, by contrast, are out of control.\" They had found a black politician they felt comfortable with, and wanted him to be everything: Martin Luther King, John F Kennedy, a griot, president, vice-president, motherhood and apple pie. They prattled on about a post-racial America as though the Jena Six never happened and Sean Bell, a unarmed black man from Queens who was riddled with bullets on his wedding day, was still alive.</p> <p>My wife, who is African American, shared my reservations about Obama, but saw things differently. She remembers the thrill of being a young girl when the black Democrat Harold Washington was elected in her hometown, Chicago. She liked him because her parents liked him. She could see it was important, but she didn't know why.</p> <p>\"My dad grew up being told a black person couldn't be a pilot, and my son is growing up knowing that a black person can be president,\" she said. \"It's not that racism is gone, it's just that it's not about the idea that all black people are excluded on the basis of their race from any part of society or any particular job. That was the racism my parents grew up with and that is now one generation removed from Osceola.\" Her dad became a pilot, as did her brother.</p> <p>Of course, Obama isn't standing for Osceola's benefit - which is just as well, because if Osceola could vote he would most likely support Elmo for mayor of Sesame Street. But in a sense these projections lie at the heart of any thoughtful appraisal of the racial dynamics underpinning Obama's candidacy. The desire to believe we are in a paradigm-shifting moment must be set against the fact that not every historic first changes the course of history. Changing our understanding of what is possible doesn't, in itself, create new possibilities. </p> <p>I watched Obama accept the Democratic nomination with my mother-in-law, Janet, in a cinema on the southside of Chicago. Janet was raised in the South with the laws that put her at the back of the bus. As a teenager she went with her mother to see Martin Luther King speak in Philadelphia, listening in the overflow in the vestry because there were too many people in the church.</p> <p>She was the one who first told me about Obama in 2003. She got involved in his primary campaign for the Senate when he didn't have a prayer, after she'd seen him on the local public channel, when he was a state senator. \"He seemed like a bright guy,\" she says. \"He reasoned his way through things and was always very impressive.\" She particularly liked his stance on the war. When he said he was running for Senate, she signed up as a volunteer. </p> <p>And now, here we were just five years later seeing him clinch the deal in Denver on the big screen. At one point, when he recalled his anti-war speech in 2002, she punched my arm. \"I was there.\" As she drove me to my hotel, she would occasionally say to no one in particular: \"I just don't believe it.\"</p> <p>Whether Osceola would ever be able to relate to what a momentous time this is for Janet remains to be seen. But her response made me think that the late comedian George Carlin was wrong. Symbols are too important to be left to the symbol-minded. By that time, my thinking on Obama had evolved. Not so much because of the man, but the moment. The atmosphere during this campaign has been unlike anything I've ever seen in a western country. To see so many people - particularly young people - engaged and hopeful about their political future after eight depressing years is inspiring. The last time I saw it was in South Africa's first democratic elections in 1994.</p> <p>Walking down Sumter Street during Charleston's Martin Luther King day parade, watching white volunteers chant: \"Obama '08! We're ready. Why wait?\" gave political voice to an America I never doubted existed, but had yet to see. Among them was a young man who was \"so depressed\" after Obama's New Hampshire defeat that he had dropped everything he had been doing in Guatemala and flown back to help out. Local African Americans lined the sidewalks, cheering encouragement. Obama's victory in Iowa had proved that a black candidacy was not a pipe dream. </p> <p>It was a moment. Fleeting and maybe even fatuous. But nonetheless a political moment that produced hopeful human engagement. Within half an hour it had evaporated. The white volunteers went back to the office and black people went back to their homes in the poorest parts of town and waited for change. But that didn't mean it didn't happen or that it couldn't happen again. Nor was there anyone else who could make it happen.</p> <p>A couple months later came Obama's race speech in Philadelphia in response to the attacks on his pastor, Jeremiah Wright, in which he addressed black alienation and white disadvantage, set them both in a historical context, and then called on people to rise above it. It was a tall order. He pulled it off.</p> <p>That weekend, a friend invited us to brunch with a group of other black people to discuss the fallout. There were nine of us (10 if you include Osceola, who yanked a blind from the window). It was a typical boho (black bohemian) Brooklyn crowd of voluntary sector workers, teachers and the like. Most, like me, had been ambivalent about Obama at the outset. But his candidacy was becoming a vehicle for something bigger: a teachable moment about the potential of anti-racist discourse.</p> <p>A year before, Hillary Clinton's chief strategist, Mark Penn, laid out a plan of attack against Obama. \"All of these articles about his boyhood in Indonesia and his life in Hawaii are geared towards showing his background is diverse, multicultural and putting that in a new light. Save it for 2050. It also exposes a strong weakness for him - his roots to basic American values and culture are at best limited. I cannot imagine America electing a president during a time of war who is not at his centre fundamentally American in his thinking and in his values ... Let's explicitly own 'American' in our programmes, the speeches and the values. He doesn't ... Let's use our logo to make some flags we can give out. Let's add flag symbols to the backgrounds.\"</p> <p>Clinton rejected Penn's advice, but McCain pretty much adopted it. And at this point it appears to have failed. This time Republicans have misread white America's appetite for divisive racial rhetoric and overestimated its fear of the other. The fears and division are still there. But whatever the result on Tuesday, they are clearly no longer the decisive mobilising force they once were. </p> <p>If there is promise in here for my son, it is not so much that he is capable of doing anything he wants - I am his father and it's my responsibility to teach him that - but that white people won't necessarily stop him. What that does for his odds of finishing high school or going to jail remains to be seen. In the meantime, I'm off to the bookshop.</p>",
  "<p>The soldiers of the Golden Dragons, serving north of Baghdad, have recently seen more of the badlands than any other combat unit, but seem split about who to back as their next commander-in-chief.</p> <p>Units from the first battalion of the 14th infantry regiment have been in Iraq for 11 months and are due to return to their base in Hawaii around the time the next president is inaugurated in mid-January. </p> <p>\"To tell you the truth, I don't care so much, I just want to leave,\" said Army Specialist Robert Eacrott, 22, from Puyallup, Washington state. \"Having said that, I think most people have come to the conclusion that change is good for our country and I'm voting for Obama.\"</p> <p>Eacrott is one of many soldiers considering leaving the army rather than face another extended tour in Iraq or Afghanistan. He believes Obama is more likely to kick-start the domestic economy, into which he will soon return to start a new life. \"I'm thinking about becoming a policeman or perhaps working as a bodyguard. I just think it's time that the Democrats took over for a bit in our country.\"</p> <p>Soldiers who are backing Obama or supporting McCain appear divided along the lines of those planning to leave the military and those planning to make a career from it.</p> <p>\"McCain is pro-military and, no matter what you think of Bush, so was he,\" said one staff sergeant from the 1st battalion 14th infantry regiment (1/14). \"McCain will continue the Republican commitment to the military and Obama has already said he intends to scale the war back. McCain has already said he wants two extra brigades for Afghanistan.</p> <p>\"I want to stay in for 20 years,\" he said. \"I have a wife and kid and it's clear to me who best serves my interests.\"</p> <p>But Obama does have military credentials in the eyes of some. Specialist Roberto Ruiz, from 3rd platoon, 1/14, said it was the Illinois senator, not the decorated war hero, who was likely to boost defence spending or keep it at record highs.</p> <p>\"Things may change a little,\" he said from his Striker armoured personnel carrier on arrival at ground zero of the former al-Qaida heartlands. There could be better pay and benefits under Obama. Personally, I hope a little history happens. It could be good for our country.\"</p> <p>Riding alongside was Jesus Gonzales, 26, from Texas, who was also hoping Obama would prevail. Both men were born into Mexican families, raised in the US and enlisted in the US army, but neither has yet been given American citizenship, so has not been able to vote.</p> <p>\"That will change when I get back,\" said Ruiz, who is considering a career in media. \"We'll both turn to our citizenships there.\"</p> <p>Around the giant Taji base, which covers an area of operations from Abu Ghraib, west of Baghdad, to Tarmeyah in the north east, soldiers have been walking door to door collecting ballots.

Poll dates are also displayed in mess halls and shopping complexes.</p> <p>But polling day is a non-event for many soldiers who have few means to keep abreast of the snakes-and-ladders momentum of the campaign, or the thrust of debates and polling. \"At the end of the day, it is not going to affect us that much, at least in the short term,\" said another sergeant who did not want to be named. \"We have good commanders and they influence our worlds more.\"</p>",
  "<p>It's so very poignant to see the American DVD release of John Milius's red-baiting 1980s classic Red Dawn happening in the present political climate. It makes you wonder whether the distributors thought they ought to get it out before the era it so neatly embodies is definitively flushed down history's toilet. Like Oliver Stone's W, it has a two-week window of opportunity to cash in before it becomes utterly irrelevant.</p> <p>Make no mistake, Red Dawn, which speculates darkly on what might happen if America were invaded by the Russians, is an important movie, perhaps the most important rightwing movie ever made in Hollywood. To a generation of overweight rightwing bloggers of the post-Star Wars generation \u2014 the Reagan babies who thought Alex Keaton was the hero of Family Ties, not a creepy yuppie dickhead and Ralph Reed-lookalike \u2014 Red Dawn is what The Battle Of Algiers was to late-60s leftwing radicals. It may not offer as plausible a blueprint for revolution as Pontecorvo's classic did for the Weather Underground or the Red Army Faction and countless more serious third world revolutionaries, but it offers something rightwing moviegoers rarely get to see: the consoling myth of people of a common political perspective and common values working together \u2014 beleaguered, outnumbered, always in mortal danger \u2014 to overthrow a sick leftwing dispensation and usher another, brighter, righter world into being. In their minds, these guys dream of being one of Patrick Swayze's teenage insurgents, the Wolverines from Red Dawn.</p> <p>It flatters the vanity of rightwingers in Hollywood that they are a tiny subversive force, kept out of the precincts of power by scheming liberal studio heads, black- or grey-listed, or enslaved as involuntary drones in a huge factory for subversive leftie propaganda. That they are, in short, victims.</p> <p>This mindset inflects two films that feature similar casts and are both classifiable as conservative movies. Swing Vote is a mild, rather dreary, political comedy in which Kevin Costner (a one-time GHW Bush contributor who has since recanted) plays a feckless Joe-the-plumber-type blue-collar bozo who ends up casting the lone vote that will decide who wins the presidential election. In the movie he's cynically courted by the candidates, Republican Kelsey Grammer and Democrat Dennis Hopper. Its politics are cuddly centre-right but those of An American Carol, from post-9/11 rightwing convert and Airplane writer David Zucker, are mean-spirited and hard-right, the ramblings of rich overdog creeps who see threats to their fortunes as threats to America. Naturally it received its premiere at last month's Republican convention.</p> <p>Grammer and Hopper both reappear in this miserably unfunny adaptation of A Christmas Carol \u2014 backed by $20m from the producer of The Passion Of The Christ \u2014 in which a truly vicious parody of Michael Moore (played by Chris Farley's brother Kevin \u2014 Tommy Boy must be rotating in his commodious casket), having mounted a campaign to abolish the fourth of July, is tormented by various \"spirits of America past\". The remainder of the cast is a who's-who of the contemporary scrag end of Hollywood's New Right. Grammer is the spirit of fascist-sympathiser George S Patton, while Jon Voight is George Washington. Voight has been busy on the campaign trail for John McCain this year and in July he shared with the Washington Times some sense of how dementedly far gone he now is in his politics. To wit: \"The Democrats have targeted young people, knowing how easy it is to bring forth whatever is needed to program their minds. I know this process well. I was caught up in the hysteria during the Vietnam era, which was brought about through Marxist propaganda underlying the so-called peace movement.\" (It goes on like that for 1,000 words.) Other righties like James Woods and Robert Davi have also lent what remains of their threadbare prestige to this excrement (the only absentee is sanctimonious war-hawk Ron Silver), and the result is as you'd expect. At the box office two weekends ago, it was one of many bad films crapped upon from a great height by Beverly Hills Chihuahua.</p> <p>This signal failure to appeal to any moviegoers at all was immediately excused with cries of fraud and conspiracy at the box offices of the nation's multiplexes. This notice appears on the movie's website: \"We have had heard from numerous people across the country that there has been some ticket fraud when buying a ticket for An American Carol this past weekend. Please check your ticket. If you were in fact one of those people that were 'mistakenly' sold a ticket for another movie please fill out the form below. Hold on to your ticket so we can have proof. Please email us a picture of your ticket stub to fraud@americancarol.com.\"</p> <p>Imagine that: the bored, spotty teenagers who hand out movie tickets all got together in a gigantic plot \u2014 one that would impress a hardened 9/11 conspiracy-paranoiac \u2014 to underplay the success of An American Carol!</p> <p>It is this sort of paranoia that really appeals to Hollywood's rightwingers. For years they have identified themselves as some oppressed minority of the truly good and true, like the persecuted early Christians or the French Resistance, working behind enemy lines with valour and honour (and all those other rightwing buzzwords), bathed in the Lord's good graces, as the hateful Lib'rul fascist elite forever grind their boot-heels in their faces.</p> <p>Coteries like the Wednesday Morning Club, founded by far-right gadfly David Horowitz to establish a conservative beachhead in the movie business, include on their guestlists such figures as Tom Selleck, Kurt Russell (a Libertarian, not a Republican), rightwing British transplant director Lionel Chetwynd (Hanoi Hilton), gameshow host Pat Sajak, writer-producer and Robert Zemeckis collaborator Bob Gale, and ex-Cheers writer Rob Long. With a secret army as motley as this, the revolution will be a very long time a-coming.</p> <p>It's the isolation that the beleaguered righties really savour: the opportunity to hang out with fellow egomaniacs of like political inclination, whine about how put-upon they all are, in their Bel Air mansions and palatial McBeach Houses, and to swell up in righteous indignation at the way the system keeps them down.</p> <p>More surprising are those disgusting traitors to the noble cause; people like Dennis Hopper who, to my surprise, turns out to have been a Republican for years (let's face it, he makes self-styled Republican Party Reptile PJ O'Rourke look like a teetotaller). He recently jumped ship with this surprising announcement: \"I voted for Bush, father and son, but this time I'll vote for Obama. I was the first person in my family to have been Republican. For most of my life I wasn't on the left. I pray God, Barack Obama is elected.\" No more Wednesday Morning Club meetings for Dennis, I fear, as the righties have been jumping all over him ever since.</p> <p>The truth is that Hollywood's a pragmatic town. If it's rightwing and it makes money, it'll be backed. If it's rightwing comedy that's not funny at all, chances are the studios will pass on it. If not, the audience will soon enough find you out, as happened spectacularly with Carol, and with This Just In, the cancelled rightwing rip-off of The Daily Show created by self-proclaimed \"rightwing nutjob\" Joel Surnow, who I haven't spotted on the welfare line lately.</p> <p>But this truth doesn't matter. What counts is that treasured sense of grievance and victimhood encapsulated in the words of Gods And Generals director, conservative Ronald Maxwell, interviewed at the rightwing Liberty Film Festival some years ago: \"The elites are using us. Never forget that we are the victims.\" Spoken like a true Wolverine. Now say goodnight, boys, your day is just about done.</p> <p>\u2022 An American Carol is heading straight to DVD, we presume</p>",
  "<p>An American presidential election in the modern era is, to be sure, an interesting paradox.

  "<p>Condoleezza Rice always seemed the outsider in George W Bush's administration. The first black woman to serve as secretary of state, she was a smart addition to Bush's circle; even many neocons considered her a safeguard against the boys' club that Bush gathered around him. Instead, she simply stood by as the White House team prepared for war, her dazzling smile seeming ever more odd and, after Hurricane Katrina, downright inappropriate.</p> <p>Just as odd is Oliver Stone's choice to play Rice in his biopic of Bush, called simply W. But at 35, some 18 years younger than her character, Thandie Newton is also the perfect actress, a natural beauty who dissolves into the part, playing Rice as a smirking bundle of hair and makeup whose stance on Bush's war never quite emerges through the soundbites. In Stone's own words he cast her because, \"Thandie's one of the top 10 actresses in the world.\" Newton's not so sure, however. \"I haven't told him this,\" she says, breaking from filming on set in Shreveport, Louisiana, \"but when he said, 'What do you think Condo-leezza?', I was thinking, 'Are you crazy?!'\"</p> <p>W might well be Newton's most important moment in the spotlight since her Bafta-winning turn in Crash, a role that won her a Best Supporting Actress Bafta, vindicating her decision to turn her back on the Hollywood mainstream and concentrate on raising a family with her writer-director husband Ol Parker. As a result, she said yes to a string of hit Britflicks (Run, Fat Boy, Run; RocknRolla) that arguably did her more good than the Charlie's Angels movie she turned down. Here, she tells the Guide about life in Oliver's army \u2026</p> <p><strong>How hard was it to turn yourself into Condoleezza Rice?</strong></p> <p>It was a huge amount of terrifying work. There was always more to learn, new books coming out. But I love research. It was like going back to Cambridge again, getting out old dusty books at Haddon Library. It was like doing a PhD. I could do a Mastermind on her now. But I was mostly preoccupied with Oliver Stone's Condoleezza Rice. She serves this story and Josh Brolin's Bush. Our dynamic was a real little slice of uniqueness.</p> <p><strong>You couldn't use prosthetics due to local humidity but the physical transformation is uncanny ...</strong></p> <p>Hearing that was scary because we have different-shaped face muscles and jaw lines so makeup shading was key. I worked with makeup artist Kay Montano to create a look inspired by [conceptual American photographer] Cindy Sherman. This whole thing's like a dream, a whacked-out Wizard Of Oz, Cindy Sherman opera. And Condoleezza reminded me of Maggie Thatcher. They both went to a finishing school and there's a similarity in how much they smile, sometimes in the most inappropriate places.</p> <p><strong>Was this your first encounter with Oliver Stone?</strong></p> <p>We met a few years ago about something else. I really pissed him off because I hadn't seen his current movie at that time. This time I met him at his house in LA. On the drive there I thought, \"Is this really where he lives? Where he exists?\" That anomaly, for me anyway, was so refreshing. Having a proper angry intellectual in Hollywood just seems not to make any sense. What's there to be angry about? You have to look for any disease or disturbance. </p> <p>Going to Oliver's place was like finding a museum.</p> <p><strong>You've mentioned that \"it's so good to act again\". What do you mean by that ?</strong></p> <p>I really don't know what I do normally. And that's not out of disrespect to the people I've worked with but it can be horribly easy to have this be a hobby. Well, not even a hobby because it pays you money. You can give it your best but it can be difficult to think, \"Am I going to do this for the rest of my life?\" Working on W was brief but every now and again there's a recharge of the battery. This was one of them but honestly RocknRolla was too. It's when things take you by surprise; you think you can do something without thinking and suddenly realise you've got to actually use your attention and be present. </p> <p><strong>What was it like working with Guy Ritchie on RocknRolla?</strong></p> <p>Guy is special. I was so excited to work with him and knew this kind of banter and characters were his preferred vehicle. I did think, \"Oh God, this is unknown territory for me\" but I like jumping without opening my eyes. Not to jeopardise my equilibrium but to push myself out of my comfort zone. And if the director believes you can do it then you can, even if you don't know it. It's a question of respect.</p> <p><strong>Had you met Madonna before?</strong></p> <p>Just at a party years ago, in a long line at the court of Madonna. But I had a little time meeting her after the movie was finished. I was at jujitsu practice with [my daughter] Ripley. Rocco goes to the same jujitsu school which Guy had told me about. Madonna came and was just a mum sitting there, but also someone I really like and admire. It was a lovely warm feeling. She's this exquisitely beautiful, delicate woman. </p> <p><strong>You starred in last year's Norbit with Eddie Murphy, a hit film perceived by some as racist. Did that worry you?</strong></p> <p>The first draft, written by Eddie and his brother [Charles], was so out-there offensive it became satire. But I think it was mainstreamed so much it became hateful rather than satirical. You do things with your best intentions that don't always work out. End of story. </p> <p><strong>How important do you think your ethnicity has been to your career?</strong></p> <p>Jason Isaacs [Harry Potter adversary Lucius Malfoy] said to me once, \"I wish I was in an ethnic minority when I look at your career, Thandie.\" And it's true. God, lucky me. There are times when I think about my mum and the rural upbringing she had in Zimbabwe. You can't get more rural. And I've been to Cambridge University, I've got a successful career. How fantastic. I think accountants are most responsible for who gets cast and if you happen to be black - well, look at Will Smith. He's the biggest star in the world and if we get caught up in the fact that it's because he's black, we're missing the point. But there are times when I wonder why I don't get more magazine covers. </p> <p><strong>Have you ever discussed this with your friend Oprah?</strong></p> <p>She's a good friend of mine, the fairy godmother. At times I need a little help with my direction in life and she is one of those inspiring people. I don't overuse that channel because she's busy, but her love for, and knowledge of, me are a huge help. We shoot each other emails now and again and if I don't get one back that's cool.</p> <p><strong>Do you regret any of the films you've made? </strong></p> <p>Absolutely none. I make a film, I move on. I accept responsibility; I have to because I was a part of it. Some people don't like it, some people do; there it goes. That's not just a blanket \"everything I've done is fine\". But often, more challenging things that come from having made mistakes are what make you grow artistically and personally. I just accept all of them</p> <h2>Who could play who in W's sequel?</h2> <p><strong>O (OB-AM-A) THE MOVIE </strong></p> <p>Starring...</p> <p><strong>Will Smith</strong> as <strong>Barack Obama</strong> </p> <p><strong>Beyonc\u00e9</strong> as <strong>Michelle Obama </strong></p> <p><strong>Michael Douglas</strong> as <strong>Joe Biden </strong></p> <p><strong>Meryl Streep</strong> as <strong>Hillary Clinton </strong></p> <p><strong>Tom Cruise</strong> as <strong>John Edwards </strong></p> <p><strong>Jeffrey Wright</strong> as <strong>Jeremiah Wright </strong></p> <p><strong>John Malkovich</strong> as <strong>Bill Ayers </strong></p> <p><strong>Domenick Lombardozzi (Herc from The Wire)</strong> as <strong>Joe the plumber</strong></p> <p><strong>Robert Duvall</strong> as <strong>John McCain </strong></p> <p><strong>Sarah Palin</strong> as <strong>Tina Fey</strong></p> <p>\u2022 W is out on Friday</p>",
  "<p>As the most gripping US presidential election since 1968 enters its final few days, I have been talking with people in the downstate Illinois college town where I attended primary school and university, and left nearly 30 years ago to live in the UK. It was here that I voted for the first time in 1976 for Jimmy Carter. </p> <p>Carter was a puzzle to me then, though I have come to admire him. He spoke openly about his Christian faith - major American politicians on the national stage did not do that in the 1960s and 1970s. It wasn't that talking about faith and politics was an alien activity to me; it was bread and butter at our dinner table in a hybrid form of Anglo-Catholicism mixed with left-of-centre Democrat. But making an explicit connection between the two in public discourse wasn't done - in the same way prayers belonged in church and the home, and not in the public schools. </p> <p>Despite British stereotypes, there are plenty of American Christians whose faith informs their progressive political convictions and who believe it is the separation of church and state that ensures a healthy relationship between the two, at least in the American polity. Perhaps the biggest irony of American politics of the last 30 years was that it was the liberal Jimmy Carter who woke the dragon of the Christian right; a Dr Frankenstein whose creation crushed the most devout and theologically literate president of the modern era. </p> <p>The damage done by the Christian right needs no retelling here. A comment made by a friend in Illinois is that if you are a Christian, but not a conservative evangelical fundamentalist who has trouble distinguishing The Flintstones from the Book of Genesis, you hardly, if ever, describe yourself as a Christian. You are a Lutheran, a Roman Catholic, a Methodist, an Episcopalian, and so forth. The Christian right has taken possession of the word - we aren't just yet to that point in Britain.</p> <p>The other memory as I walk around this leafy college town, which would almost certainly have voted for Obama even if it wasn't in his home state, is a novel I read as an undergraduate, Irving Wallace's The Man, published in 1964 and made into a film in 1972. It tells the story of the first black president of the United States. In a country still marred by segregation and Jim Crow legislation, such a thing was only imaginable, even in fiction, by killing off the president and the speaker of the house in an improbable accident coupled with a vice-president too ill to take office. The succession fell to the president pro tempore of the Senate, a black senator from the midwest. (Let me translate: a modern English equivalent would be a novel about the first female Archbishop of Canterbury. A bishop of a small and poor diocese, she emerges as one of the few unscathed survivors after the ceiling has collapsed on a House of Bishops meeting. The novel would be entitled The Woman.) Wallace's improbable chain of catastrophes was the only way that the idea of an African-American in the White House was conceivable well beyond the 1970s.</p> <p>Yet here we are, possibly on the verge of seeing the first black president of the US. If Barack Obama takes possession of the Oval Office in January it will not be through a string of unlikely disasters but through the testing, in a grinding campaign, of a candidate who has fired the middle and progressive ground in American politics as no one has in decades. That is clear from listening to people, both town and gown, in the heartland of the midwest. He will also be the most theologically literate Christian in that office since Jimmy Carter. At such a transformational moment, perhaps Lutherans, Roman Catholics, Methodists, even the much-maligned (in certain Church of England circles) Episcopalians, can wrestle the word Christian back from the Christian right.</p> <p>\u2022 Dr Judith Maltby is chaplain and fellow of Corpus Christi College and reader in church history at the University of Oxford</p>",

Their stoic aversion to the lure of victimhood puts you in mind of those heart-rendingly brave wartime East Enders, as filmed by Pathe News, standing outside the smoking husks that had once been their homes, grinning in toothless defiance as they cheered the passing Mr Churchill.</p> <p>\"Very simple,\" Marcus Wareing said when asked recently why he had broken up with Gordon Ramsay. \"When you wake up in the morning and look in the mirror and all you see is a man who is constrained, confined and trapped, then you've got to change. I want to be my own man.\" </p> <p>Ah, the agony of imprisonment at the Berkeley, with Gordon as Mr Mackay. Not since John McCain in the Hanoi Hilton did any man suffer such grievous incarceration at a leading hotel. Until, finally, Marcus drove out his jailer - Gordon departed the Berkeley, taking with him the name of Petrus and leaving his erstwhile close buddy sprinkled with the fairy dust of eponymity.</p> <p>In principle, this must be a wise move. A few weeks ago, I banged on about how that other top Ramsay prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, Angela Hartnett, should do the same, her luminescent talent demanding a restaurant that reflects her personality rather than her ever more corporately minded lord and master. The minor problem here, I think, is that Marcus Wareing At The Berkeley remains, in spirit, a Gordon gaff. It's still the earliest of days, but for now the room retains the faintly clinical aura of one created with public company money. It looks warm enough - with velvety, deep mauve walls and plush carpet - but it feels a bit chilly, characterless and temple-of-foody, as grand hotel restaurants so often do.</p> <p>For all that, the outstanding and ever reliable Harden's guide recently declared this London's finest, and if scores of well-informed Harden's \"reporters\" (aka well-informed punters who pay their own bills) rate it so highly, there must be sound reason for that. And yet while there is no denying Wareing's brilliance, only one dish screamed \"Best In London\". Several amuse-bouches were excellent, as was my friend's starter, from the dearer, \u00a375 \u00e0 la carte menu, of poached lobster with braised pig's trotters, vanilla butter and roasted salsify. It grew on him, an initial, \"Mmmm, nice enough\" developing into an appreciation of how well the intensity of the trotters worked with the delicacy of the lobster. My starter of fantastically fresh, honey-soused sardines with ricotta, crayfish and sweet peppers, from the slightly perfunctory \u00a335 set lunch menu, zinged with sharp, clear flavours, but there was an irksome parsimony about the portion.</p> <p>My main course of poached and glazed organic chicken (sausage-shaped breast, crispy wing and thigh) with onion fondue was a textural delight, and the skin was wonderful, but this was more comforting than electrifying, and palpably oversalted. My friend's Welsh suckling pig, \"cooked for 24 hours\", with braised chicory and pommes mousseline, echoed his starter by improving with every mouthful, until a cursory \"good\" had been upgraded to an animated, \"God, that's good.\" But why will they rush these things? Another few days and it would have been incredible.</p> <p>The best came last in the form of a pudding recommended by one of myriad waiters, all of whom stayed the right side of over-attentive. Raspberry and milk chocolate gateau with Eton mess was fine, but my baked egg custard tart was just sensational. I vaguely recall Wareing winning a Great British Menu puds section with this riot of creamy, eggy, cinnamony rapture, and serving it to the sovereign. And no wonder, because what a magnificent dish this is to set before a queen. </p> <p>All in all, then, this was a fine meal with moments of the sublime, but without quite fulfilling admittedly stellar expectations. By and large, the cooking seemed less spellbinding than I remember it when Wareing was first banged up at HMP Berkeley several years ago. </p> <p>\"If he wants me never to get to the status I want,\" says this culinary Norman Stanley Fletcher of Gordon's alleged ambition to prevent Marcus ever matching his own Michelin haul, \"then my advice to him is: put a gun to my head, shoot me, put me in a box and bury me, because if you don't, I'll come back and come back. I'll never give up until I get to where I want to go.\" In other words, to borrow from another fabled stoic who once fell out with a Gordon, he's a fighter not a quitter, so that third star may well one day be his. On this form, however, he has a little way yet to travel along Freedom Avenue.</p> <h2>The bill</h2> <p><strong>Three-course \u00e0 la carte: \u00a375</strong></p> <p>Lobster &amp; pig's trotter<br>Welsh suckling pig<br>Raspberry &amp; chocolate gateau</p> <p><strong>Three-course set lunch: \u00a335</strong></p> <p>Soused sardines <br>Poached and glazed chicken<br>Custard tart </p> <p>Bottle Lis Neris pinot grigio \u00a335</p> <p>Glass Bonny Doon Cigare Volant \u00a313.50</p> <p><strong>\u00bd</strong> bottle Innocent Bystander \u00a322</p> <p>2 coffees (with lavish truffles) \u00a310</p> <p>Subtotal \u00a3190.50</p> <p>Service @ 12.5% \u00a323.81</p> <p><strong>Total \u00a3214.31</strong></p>",
  "<p>The best way to experience an Obama rally is to listen to him while watching the audience. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> is, of course, impressive. His speeches, like his suits, are meticulously measured. In this final week they are tailored to consolidate rather than convince. Though he is reed-thin, he can fill an auditorium, stadium or park with his presence as well as with people. With a big smile full of white teeth, he looks like the most all-American candidate the Republican party has had the misfortune to attempt to dismiss as non-American and demonise as anti-American.</p> <p>But the audience is something else. There are old black ladies dressed for church, whose hands palm up as if to pat the sky while their heads bow down, resonating points Obama makes, with hats perched on buns of salt-and-pepper hair. When he makes points that resonates their heads go down like as their hands go up, palms open, as though they are trying to pat the sky. </p> <p>There are young white kids, their universities emblazoned on their hoodies, who roll their lower arms in big circles from the elbow as though showing appreciation at a football game. There are old white veterans who occasionally nod but otherwise stay seated while others rise. And there are black children held high on parents' shoulders so they can capture a moment they do not yet fully understand.</p> <p><strong>Contagious energy</strong></p> <p>The energy is contagious. Bettie Bell, 87, was swaying to Stevie Wonder's \"Signed, Sealed, And Delivered\" as she tells me she \"never thought I'd see this day\" when a black man might be president. Bell grew up in Mississippi and moved to Ohio when she was 20. \"We couldn't vote back then. But this time I voted already ... The Bible says, 'One day a small nation will rise up.' Well it's our time and it feels wonderful.\" </p> <p>The numbers are staggering. A capacity crowd of 4,900 in the civic centre in Canton, Ohio; 9,000 outside in the teaming rain in Chester, Pennsylvania; 35,000 at 11pm in Kissimmee, Florida. </p> <p>To hear supporters talk, you would think they have come not out of volition, but compulsion. \"I just had to be here,\" says Jeannie, who drove from West Palm Beach to Kissimmee to see Obama. \"I can hardly believe I've come this far to go to a rally in the middle of the night. But it's history. I had to see it for myself at least once.\"</p> <p>As the week drew to a close, the mood was torn between anticipation and anxiety. On the one hand, supporters feel as though they are on the verge of a great historical moment. On the other, they resist the complacency that could deny it to them. For the last 20 months they have been told to believe. With 72 hours to go, they dare not believe too much.</p> <p>\"After the last two times I just don't want to jinx it,\" says Susan Aylward, from Akron, Ohio. \"Everything looks good. But I won't believe it until it actually happens.\"</p> <p>In the parts of the country where the election will be decided, they've counted chickens before, and have no intention of doing it again. Chris Magoon, a field organiser in Canton, told people to \"put the polls away\" and reminded them that Ohio was lost in 2004 by just nine votes per precinct. When the pastor who delivered the convocation in Chester, Pennsylvania, the same morning said: \"Lead us not into temptation,\" the sin he was referring to was hubris.</p> <p>There is also the pervasive fear that Obama might be assassinated. Nobody says it out loud, but nobody needs to. The pastor who blessed the Chester rally called for God to \"deliver us from evil that will harm any candidate\". In Canton the clergyman looked for God to \"Love him, carry him and keep him\".</p> <p>Then there are worries that the election will be stolen. The pastor in Canton prayed that \"every voting machine will work correctly\". Jeannie in Kissimmee shrugged at what surprises election day might bring. \"It's Florida,\" she says. \"You just never know.\"</p> <p>And finally there is mistrust of polls that may mask racial prejudice. Rosa Scott of Canton, who is in her 70s, grew up in Montgomery, Alabama, and remembers the bus boycott lead by Martin Luther King. \"Down there they let you know if they didn't like you. But here they're more sneaky with it.\"</p> <p>Obama opened the last full week of campaigning in Ohio with his closing argument. It is a hybrid of the unifying themes that first gained him national attention - reassurance that his taxation policy will only affect the very wealthy, and his trademark call for change. He rose to prominence in 2004 because of his opposition to the war. But as he heads to the finish line four years later Iraq barely gets a mention.</p> <p>The question in this election, he says, is not: \"Are you better off than you were four years ago?\" - referring to Ronald Reagan's now famous jibe at the Carter years. \"We already know the answer to that. Will this country be better off four years from now?\" </p> <p>In a populist turn, he asks the audience: \"How many of you earn less than $250,000 a year?\" When they all put up their hands he continues, \"Well, my tax policy won't cost you a dime.\"</p> <p>Ridiculing McCain's claim that his \"desire to spread the wealth\" makes him a socialist, he said: \"Lately, they've been calling me a socialist and they found evidence that when I was in kindergarten I used to share my toys, and in the fourth grade I split my peanut butter sandwich and they said look, he's a redistributionist ... There's nothing wrong with looking out for other people.\" The Florida crowd starts a chant of \"O-bama\". </p> <p>As he flies around the country, local and national events provide him with a strong tailwind. On the day he came to Ohio, the Cleveland Plain Dealer's front page was about Friday's collapse of Ohio's largest bank, National City. The next day the Philadelphia Inquirer showcased the conviction of Alaska's Republican senator, Ted Stevens, on six counts of ethics violations, bringing the possibility of a filibuster-proof Senate one vote closer. </p> <p>As he took to the stage in Kissimmee, the Orlando Sentinel reported that polling hours had been extended to cater for the unprecedented surge in early voting, with registered Democrats overrepresented and African Americans punching almost twice their demographic weight at the booths.</p> <p>For all the caveats, caution, denial and downplay, Obama's itinerary explains why he has every reason to be confident. With the exception of Pennsylvania, Obama has spent the last week travelling in states George Bush won in 2004. He needs 18 more electoral college votes than Kerry to win. </p> <p>He hasn't been behind in a poll in Iowa (seven votes) since he accepted the nomination, nor in New Mexico (five) in seven weeks. He has led in Virginia (13) and Colorado (nine) for the past month, and Florida (27), Ohio (20) and Nevada (five) for at least the last week. He is mounting challenges in North Carolina and Missouri. </p> <p><strong>Tightening race</strong></p> <p>He only needs one or two of these polls to be right to win. His team expect the race to tighten in these final days. But for him to lose, there would have to be a full-scale, last-minute reversal.</p> <p>With Bill Clinton by his side in Florida for the first time, the Democratic party's generational baton-change is almost complete. Leaving the stadium in the dead of night, the weight of expectation is evident in the T-shirts on sale. Some bear a socialist-realist print of Obama's face with a single word like Hope, Progress, Believe or Change. One shows Obama and Martin Luther King with the message: \"Dreams we can believe in\". Another has him dressed like a secret service agent and \"Mission Possible\".Yet another in Spanish says: \"Nosotros creemos en el cambio\" (We believe in change). </p> <p>With only three days left to sell, hawkers scour the crowd for people who might yet buy. They've bought his message. But will they wear it? It's five to midnight. He's closed his arguments. Now he has to close the deal.</p> <h2>Key moments of the campaign</h2> <p><strong>January 3: Iowa Democrat caucuses</strong></p> <p>Barack Obama wins Iowa caucuses after deploying large group of paid field staff who organise supporters, ensuring a big turnout. His victory proves his viability, especially among wary African-American voters, and anoints him the early front-runner.</p> <p><strong>January 7: Clinton cries in New Hampshire</strong></p> <p>The former first lady is fighting for survival when one voter's innocuous question about her appearance \u2014 how do you manage? \u2014 leads to tears<br>before the TV cameras. What initially looked like a gaffe became the humanising moment she needed, and led to a win in New Hampshire. </p> <p><strong>March 4: McCain wins Republican nomination</strong></p> <p>Given up for dead in 2007, McCain surges to victory in four states and secures the Republican nomination He promises to give voters \"a contest of ideas\" rather than \"an uncivil brawl\" but he accepts George Bush's endorsement.</p> <p><strong>January 28: Kennedy backs Obama</strong></p> <p>Obama is often compared to John F Kennedy\u2014 both men sought the presidency as young, untested senators with a gift for oratory. He wins the powerful family's support when the late president's brother, Senator Ted Kennedy, and daughter, Caroline, declared him the heir to JFK's legacy.</p> <p><strong>February 29: The 3am phone call advert</strong></p> <p>The Clinton team, realising Obama is in for the long haul, tries to make voters fear his inexperience. Clinton's now-classic advert tried to make voters fear his inexperience, featuring the White House phone ringing in the dead of night, inspires numerous parodies \u2014 and more than a few stump speeches from John McCain.</p> <p><strong>April 28: The Rev Wright speaks</strong></p> <p>Obama faces tricky questions about his outspoken former pastor, whose sermons railing against US policies hurt his campaign with white voters. The Rev Wright responds with a combative speech accusing Obama of disowning him \"because he's a politician\".</p> <p><strong>May 6: Clinton's last stand</strong></p> <p>With her early advantage gone and her money running out, Clinton gambles all on winning Indiana and North Carolina. A narrow victory in the first and a loss in the second means the primary contest is all but over \u2014 but Hillary will not concede.</p> <p><strong>June 3: Obama clinches the nomination</strong></p> <p>It comes down to the very last states and the endorsements of super-delegates, put Obama over the victory line \u2014 and gives his wife their famous celebratory fist bump. Clinton does not admit defeat until days later,<br>leaving open wounds in the Democratic party.</p> <p><strong>August 28: Obama's acceptance speech</strong></p> <p>Republicans mock the Greek columns, the A-list celebrities, and the adoring throngs at Denver's Invesco Field. But when Obama emerges to give the first open-air nomination speech since Kennedy, even his critics agree it is a<br>political masterstroke, and Obama has all the momentum until ...</p> <p><strong>September 3: Meet Sarah Palin</strong></p> <p>The young governor of Alaska is the surprise choice for McCain's running mate. The choice dominates the news cycle and the Republicans find their new heroine after a convention speech combining spirited attacks with folksy appeals to God and country.</p> <p><strong>September 14: It's the economy, stupid</strong></p> <p>Wall Street investment banks Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers crumble under the weight of bad mortgage-related securities, the latest and biggest highprofile failures of the financial services industry. Obama takes advantage of American uneasiness, linking McCain to Bush and thus the crisis on Wall Street.</p> <p><strong>September 17: Palin falters</strong></p> <p>CBS news anchor Katie Couric's interviews with Palin on the law, economy and foreign affairs mark a turning point. Her cringe-inducing performance \u2014 she can only name one Supreme Court decision she disagrees with, the landmark abortion case, Roe v Wade \u2014 ignites a backlash among conservatives that persists throughout the election.</p> <p><strong>September 24: Hold the campaign</strong></p> <p>As Congress and the White House discuss the bail-out of the financial system, McCain says he will \"suspend\" his campaign and returns to Washington to help. He calls for a delay in the presidential debate. Obama calls his bluff, saying a president should be able to deal with two tough tasks at once. McCain's surrogates continue to attack Obama and campaign ads still run. The debate goes ahead as planned.</p> <p><strong>September 26: Face to Face I</strong></p> <p>The first of the three debates gives voters a side-by-side comparison of the 47-year-old gym buff and the 72-year-old former prisoner of war. In a sometimes caustic forum, Obama tries to tie McCain to Bush and McCain tries to paint Obama as dangerously inexperienced. Polls show a win for Obama.</p> <p><strong>October 2: Face to Face II</strong></p> <p>Vice-presidential debate. Sarah Palin holds her nerve against Joe Biden, delivering mostly coherent answers, surpassing expectations after the Couric interview and reviving Republican enthusiasm for her candidacy.</p> <p><strong>October 12: Enter Joe the plumber</strong></p> <p>Ohio labourer emerges as mascot for McCain's effort to tar Obama as a tax-and-spend socialist after he quizzes the Democratic candidate on the campaign trail. McCain claims that the case of Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher proves Obama's policies will hurt the little guy. It turns out that he would actually be better off under Obama's tax proposals, but that does not stop Republicans from trotting him out at rallies.</p> <p><strong>October 19: Powell's sucker punch</strong></p> <p>Colin Powell, George Bush's former secretary of state and one of the most powerful African Americans in US history, broke with the Republican party, saying Obama \"demonstrated the kind of calm, patient, intellectual, steady approach to problem solving that I think we need in this country\". Some McCain supporters, notably radio host Rush Limbaugh, contend Powell made the pick because Obama is black.</p> <p><strong>October 29: Obama \u2014 The Movie</strong></p> <p>Obama runs a 30-minute TV ad on most major US television networks, at a cost of $1m per channel. The spot features the candidate describing his policies, and several down-and-out swing-state Americans explaining how hard they have it. The implication: If you are down on your luck, an Obama victory will improve your lot \u2014 especially if you live in Missouri, New Mexico<br>or Ohio.</p> <p><strong>Big Dog weighs in</strong> </p> <p>Days before the election, Bill Clinton holds a joint rally in Florida with Obama. Relations between the two had reportedly been testy after the bitter primaries battle, but they were all smiles and effusive praise on the night.</p>",

  "<p>In three days' time, by most reckonings, John McCain's most cherished ambition - one that has absorbed him for the best part of a decade, the defining goal of a lifetime in politics - will go up in smoke. He faces a defeat on Tuesday that some experts predict will be solid, others catastrophic. No presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan in 1980 has overturned such a poll deficit at this late stage and won the White House.</p> <p>With such grim prospects, McCain could be forgiven for spending his final days on the campaign trail bemoaning his fate, but there was no sign of any weakness of purpose in the past week. Last Tuesday he was on stage in Fayetteville, North Carolina, shaking his fist not up at the sky but out towards the packed crowd, exhorting his followers never to give up hope, never to give up the fight.</p> <p>There was an urgency, an energy, to McCain that hadn't been seen before. His running mate, Sarah Palin, may be a self-declared \"lipstick-wearing pitbull\", but this week he proved himself a wiry Jack Russell terrier, snapping at the heels of his Democratic opponent.</p> <p>\"I'm an American and I chose to fight!\" Snap! \"America is worth fighting for!\" Snap! \"Nothing is inevitable here - we don't hide from history, we make history!\" Snap! Snap!</p> <p>This unexpected side grew more pronounced as the final week of campaigning progressed, on a trail that took us from Fayetteville, with its large military population, through the Cuban exile haven of Miami, Florida, and on to the rustic towns in the crucial battleground state of Ohio. With defeat looming, and an ugly blame game already bubbling up within his party, McCain's spirits appear to have soared in inverse proportion to his declining poll ratings. </p> <p>As one placard, held by a supporter in the aptly named Ohio town of Defiance, put it: \"Mac is back.\" Yes, he is back, but not in the way the supporter meant it. </p> <p>McCain is back in his comfort zone - fulfilling his traditional role as the underdog. \"I think he enjoys the underdog role,\" said Lincoln Diaz-Balart, a Republican congressman who campaigned alongside McCain in Miami.</p> <p>Turning adversity into opportunity has been a running theme, not just of this election but of the Republican candidate's life. When he was snared in the Keating Five political funding scandal in the late 1980s, he reinvented himself as an anti-corruption crusader and salvaged his reputation; his defeat against George Bush in the 2000 primaries was converted into a positive by spawning his current image as a maverick; after he ran out of money and was on the verge of giving up his second run on the White House last summer he rallied in a swing through New Hampshire. Now he is at it again, staring oblivion in the face yet drawing succour from it. \"The pundits have written us off just like they have several times before. They were wrong then and they are wrong now,\" he told the faithful in Miami's Little Havana.</p> <p>His team insists there is method in his madness. Bill McInturff, who conducts private polls for McCain every day in 14 battleground states, circulated a memo this week suggesting the race was tightening and Obama's lead in several states now fell within the margin of error. McCain was also gaining ground among three crucial demographic groups - men without university degrees, poorer women and rural voters. </p> <p>The plucky comments coming from the McCain camp, therefore, may be more than mere whistling in the wind. </p> <p>One aide said: \"Sure we've had ups and downs, but the senator is confident, the staff are confident, and the campaign is ready for victory next week.\" </p> <p>The most extravagant chutzpah came from McCain's senatorial friend Lindsey Graham, who bragged to the rally in North Carolina that he would take on and beat swimmer Michael Phelps before Obama ever won the state - a brave wager, given that he cannot swim.</p> <p>But in reality there are some hard truths. That McCain devoted most of his final week to North Carolina, Florida and Ohio in itself told a story. All three were won by Bush in 2004 - and North Carolina has been solidly Republican since 1976 - so the deployment was purely defensive. Pennsylvania is the only state won four years ago by John Kerry in which McCain is still on the offensive.</p> <p>Then there is the extraordinary inequality in resources. Obama has poured more than $270m (\u00a3170m) into TV advertising - more than twice as much as McCain. Republicans are as aware of these disparities as anybody else. Interviews with loyalists in all three states uncovered intense anxieties that their 30-year dominance is about to be swept aside. Javier Souto, an elected official in south Florida, said he was concerned that the alliance that formed the base of the party was breaking up. \"The Democrats have been in disarray for many years. It's a pretty clear risk that the same could now happen to us,\" he said.</p> <p>Others were more intemperate. Christina Shores, a campaign volunteer in North Carolina, was born in Cork and raised in London; she emigrated to the US 20 years ago with her military husband and is now a naturalised American.</p> <p><strong>Scared to death</strong></p> <p>She said she was \"scared to death\" that Obama and the Democrats will win control of the of presidency, the house and the Senate. Then the next four years would see America transformed into a socialist state. \"I've never owned a gun. But I've told my husband that if Obama is elected, I want one in my house.\"</p> <p>Shores was one of many who were critical of McCain for being \"over-gentlemanly\" in his attacks on Obama urging him to go in harder over what they believe are his opponent's links with extreme-left politics and terrorism. \"I'm so upset,\" she said. \"Every night I watch the TV and I'm shouting at McCain: 'Come on! You've got to say something. Do something!'\"</p> <p>Palin has already let it be known she thinks the campaign has lacked bite. Others have accused McCain of lurching from issue to issue, like a signalman uncertain which lever to pull so he pulls them all. It is only in the past fortnight that he appears finally to have found the right lever, and as even he admits, that came about almost by chance. If Obama had not bumped into Samuel Wurzelbacher in Holland, Ohio, they would never have started a conversation in which the Democrat talked about his desire to \"spread wealth\", Wurzelbacher would not have morphed into Joe the Plumber and McCain would still be floundering, in search of his voice.</p> <p>\"Senator Obama is running to be distributionist-in-chief; I'm running to be commander-in-chief,\" he told crowds this week. \"Senator Obama is running to spread the wealth; I'm running to create more wealth.\"</p> <p>At every stop the response from the faithful was as identical as his words. \"Fight! Fight! Fight!\" they chanted. \"USA! USA! USA!\" By uttering that oldest of conservative war cries - the clash between the individual and society - McCain had at last engaged with their fears. </p> <p>But it has come so very late. The fight is almost over, the snapping all but done. Underdogs bear the name for a reason: they usually lose.</p>",
  "<p>Toni Morrison breaks off from explaining a crucial passage in her new novel - Florens, the main character, has just been searched by a posse of witch-hunters - to check her mobile. \"It's my son,\" she apologises, \"is he kidding me?\" She calls him back for a quick discussion about the latest presidential election headlines. </p> <p>\"We're gonna have such fun!\" she exclaims afterwards. She will watch Tuesday night's TV coverage with friends, she says excitedly, but her assessment of what an Obama presidency might mean is measured: \"It would be good, it would be interesting, it would have an impact, I think.\" Morrison famously described Bill Clinton as \"the first black president\" (\"I said he was treated like a black man, and he was, but anyway they ... what can I say? Nuance is not a strong point\"), and took her time in coming round to Obama. \"I didn't know him,\" she says. \"I knew Hillary. I really, really liked her and for years admired her.\" The first time Obama called and asked for her support she said no, but \"we chatted for quite a while\". In January she changed her mind and wrote a letter of endorsement that glowed with praise for his \"wisdom\". </p> <p>A Mercy, Morrison's first book in five years, is published in the UK on Thursday, and is released in the US a few days later. Though publishing schedules are fixed months in advance and production of the book must have been well under way by the time Barack Obama was finally selected as the Democratic candidate, the timing is surely no accident. </p> <p>In A Mercy, the 77-year-old Nobel laureate writes directly about American slavery for the first time since her celebrated 1987 novel Beloved. Though A Mercy is a very different book - around half the length, more episodic than epic, set in the 17th century rather than the 19th - it is billed by her publisher as a companion piece, or \"prelude\". Morrison says the new work is an attempt to separate racism from slavery, \"to see how it was constructed, planted deliberately in order to protect the ruling class\" from the \"unpaid labour\" on which their new civilisation and wealth depended. So as the US looks set to elect an African-American president, its pre-eminent African-American writer delivers her own vision of America uncorrupted - or only beginning to be corrupted - by racial thinking. </p> <p>Morrison's great achievement, in a career spanning four decades and nine novels, has been to combine deep psychological insight with a vigorous and original critique of American history. \"My books are always questions for me. What if? How does it feel to ...? Or what would it look like if you took racism out? Or what does it look like if you have the perfect town, everything you ever wanted? And so you ask a question, put it in a time when it would be theatrical to ask, and find the people who can articulate it for you and try to make them interesting. The rest of it is all structure, how to put it together.\" </p> <p>In her debut, The Bluest Eye (1970), written in the early mornings while she was working full-time and raising two sons in New York, Morrison crafted a highly literary fiction out of the interior lives of poor black girls growing up in her hometown of Lorain, Ohio. Sula (1973) told a story of female friendship, partly inspired by her own life as a single mother and a more complex, ambivalent view of \"sisterhood\" than many in the feminist movement would then allow, while Song of Solomon (1977) took its alienated protagonist, \"Milkman\", on a voyage of discovery to the deep south.</p> <p>But with Beloved, her prizewinning novel set in the aftermath of abolition, Morrison hurled herself at the legacy of slavery and the 20th-century American literary canon head-on. Inspired by a newspaper cutting she found while editing an African-American history anthology, The Black Book, and audaciously weaving together realist, modernist and supernatural elements, it tells the story of a runaway slave who, rather than give up her children when her former owners come looking for her, cuts her daughter's throat.</p> <p>It is a novel of unspeakable horrors. But even more than the physical brutality, Morrison confronts us with the irreparable harm done by what Margaret Atwood described in a review as \"one of the most viciously antifamily institutions human beings have ever devised\", a system that sought to deprive human beings of what it is that makes them human.</p> <p>\"We were very keenly involved in the culture of African America, so of course slavery was back there,\" Morrison says of her upbringing in the midwest, \"yet the pressure was not to remember it, but to get over it. So when I was writing Beloved, part of the architecture was the act of forgetting.\" When Beloved failed to win the National Book Award, a group of 48 African-American critics and writers including Maya Angelou and Alice Walker wrote to the New York Times praising Morrison, and the novel won the Pulitzer soon afterwards. Morrison herself is alert to the ways in which black and women's writing have been patronised and excluded from the mainstream, and after winning the Nobel in 1993 she wrote that she felt she had earned a \"licence to strut\". </p> <p>Her novels found an influential champion in Oprah Winfrey, who chose four of them for her book club, ensuring huge sales. Winfrey also produced and starred in the 1998 film of Beloved, directed by Jonathan Demme. Morrison's response to critics who suggest her canvas is too narrow is to cite Joyce and Dostoevsky: no one complains that Joyce always writes about the Irish, or Dostoevsky about Russia. She projects a formidable self-belief, but the impression of imperiousness is offset by her soft voice and almost girlish manner.</p> <p>A few years ago she bought a house on Princeton's main street, a long straight avenue with the university campus on one side and a parade of colonial-style architecture, bookshops and ice-cream parlours on the other. She has done the top floor up for her two grand-daughters, as \"classical little girls' rooms with all the pillows ... I know it's just a luxury but I had such fun.\" The contrast to her own childhood in Ohio could hardly be greater. \"There were factories there, shipyards, steel mills, and people came from all over to work,\" she says. The town was not segregated along racial lines - \"Mrs Gallini lived next door and the Terschaks on the other side, that's the way it was and I thought the whole world was like that.\" Both her parents' families migrated north to escape poverty. </p> <p>Morrison, who was born Chloe Anthony Wofford in 1931 - Toni was the nickname she took as a student, Morrison is her ex-husband - had two younger brothers and an older sister. Her father worked as a welder, but \"after the war began, my parents had less and less, and their conflicts were the conflicts poor people have.\" </p> <p>In The Bluest Eye, Morrison depicts Lorain as a town cruelly stratified along class and caste lines. Homelessness, or \"being outdoors\", is \"the real terror of life\", and while Pecola Breedlove is doomed by her perception of her own ugliness, the more spirited Claudia is frightened by urges to harm the \"little white girls\" whom even black women seem to prefer to their own daughters. Morrison has said she would have brought up her sons differently had she anticipated the poisonous race relations of the 1980s, but of her own youth she says she \"felt like an aristocrat\", and when I ask if she remembers when recognition of her own blackness dawned, wondering whether she too suffered from feelings of rage or insecurity, she fires back: \"That's not the question, the question is when you first understand you're white.\" </p> <p>But on the lessons of the past her parents were deeply divided: \"My father never trusted any white person at all, would not let them in his house, insurance people and so on. Luckily my mother was entirely different, she was always judging people one at a time. My mother talked about her childhood in the south - she left when she was about six - as if it was the most wonderful, romantic, nostalgic, lovely [memory]. And my father talked about it in diametrically opposed ways. But he went back every year to this place he hated [Georgia], while my mother never went back to Alabama, the place she loved.\"</p> <p>Such conflicts recur in her novels, which dig away at rather than paper over the cracks in the African-American story, exposing divisions of religion, politics, class and gender. She chose to go to the traditionally black Howard College in Washington DC because she \"wanted to be around black intellectuals\", and has sought to explore the compromises and sacrifices as well as the triumphs of integration. Her novel Paradise (1998) is a brutal fable of what happens when the dream of an all-black community turns sour, while Love (2003) mourns the ruin of an African-American entrepreneur's dream: an upmarket black holiday resort crumbling into the sea. </p> <p>She edited books about the controversies surrounding OJ Simpson's trial for murder and the appointment of Clarence Thomas to the supreme court, while her criticism has drawn attention to the racial themes of such classics as Moby-Dick and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. African religion, medicine and stories are shown to have vivid meaning for Morrison's characters, but she has never been to Africa: \"something always happened or I couldn't get there\". In Beloved, Stamp Paid reflects that \"Whitepeople believed that whatever the manners, under every dark skin was a jungle. Swift unnavigable waters, swinging screaming baboons, sleeping snakes, red gums ready for their sweet white blood.\" But there are black racists in her books too, who believe whites are subhuman, devils.</p> <p>With its focus on a time before the slave system, A Mercy confirms Morrison's determination to think beyond racial categories. The novel sets out to blur the lines and its characters include indentured servants, slaves, a Dutchwoman sold into marriage (whose filthy voyage is the closest Morrison has come to writing about the slave ships) and a free black man. She also writes from the point of view of a white slave owner for the first time, and when I ask whether she and others are now moving towards a \"post-racial\" literary discourse - in a parallel development to what commentators have described as Obama's \"post-racial\" politics - she concurs, before offering the qualifier that \"you have to walk that line, you don't want the culture de-raced\". </p> <p>But she agrees that the emphasis placed on race by critics has meant that other aspects of her writing have received less attention. The questions she asks in her books have deep ethical and philosophical dimensions. What is love? Can a woman recover from having killed her baby? What does it mean to be forgiven? Like Beloved, the new novel springs from the action of a mother, a slave who gives her daughter away to a different master in the belief that he will be kinder, but when I say what a terribly sad story it seemed to me - Florens is desperately hurt, and then rejected again by her first lover - I am briskly corrected: \"No, no no! Think about her, she was completely needy, yearning, selfless, 'my life is in you, I can't live without you'.\" The heartbreak of the novel, in its author's view, teaches its protagonist a lesson: \"do not give yourself over completely to anybody. At least you know she'll never do that again.\"</p> <p>Morrison calls Jazz (1992), a love story set in 1920s Harlem and narrated in such a way that the book itself speaks in the first person, her \"best book\" in terms of the technical obstacles she set herself. She relished the challenge of 17th-century dialogue posed by A Mercy, and describes her experiments with vocabulary and tenses. She has been reunited with her original editor, Robert Gottlieb, a former New Yorker editor and her exact contemporary. </p> <p>She has never got over her house in Rockland County, New York, burning down in 1993: \"My books and manuscripts I couldn't care less about, but my children's report cards ... There's a picture of my son shooting a basketball into the sky and it's gone.\" But she jokes that at least she won the Nobel prize that year as well, and has made an anecdote out of the fact that, for a long time, she could talk only to other people who had suffered house fires. (\"Maxine Hong Kingston - she and I were on the phone every day!\") </p> <p>The prospect of a book tour is more daunting than it once was, and she hopes her son Ford will join her on this one. But she has two more book projects already in mind, one of which promises a departure. Only once before, with Tar Baby (1981), has she set a story in the present, and that was in the Caribbean, but she says \"I've got sketches which are very much now\". </p> <p>For 40 years she has written of passionately experienced sexuality, and every possible permutation of family. Her early marriage to Harold Morrison, an architect from Jamaica with whom she had her two sons, lasted only six years, and she has rarely discussed it. When I ask whether she would have liked to remarry, she bats away the question with a \"no, no, no\", and she dismisses the idea that she might ever write her memoirs: \"It's just not interesting, my life is not adventurous ... The life of the mind is interesting, but all these other little foibles? Please.\"</p> <p>Morrison's family still call her Chloe, and she has often said that her pen name of Toni Morrison was a kind of accident. She says that when her father died, she was upset that she hadn't kept the name Wofford, and tells a story about a talk she gave in England where a young black woman in the audience asked her how she wanted to be remembered. \"I said as an honest, trustworthy person - I think I even put humour in there. And the girl said 'What do you mean? You just won the Nobel prize and you want to be remembered as a trustworthy person?' And I didn't know what to say. I was talking about how I want to be remembered by my family. Do I want to be remembered by my sons as a writer who won the Nobel prize? There's a persona, Toni Morrison, and there's me, Chloe. They were asking Toni Morrison and I answered as Chloe.\" </p> <p>But she is in no doubt as to what enabled her transformation from one into the other. \"My sons needed me to be real, to know what I was doing, you know? When people say they don't have time to write with small children, well, for me it was the opposite. I didn't write anything before I had them. They gave me that.\"</p> <h2>Morrison on Morrison</h2> <p>\"I walk alone except for the eyes that join me on my journey. Eyes that do not recognise me, eyes that examine me for a tail, an extra teat, a man's whip between my legs. Wondering eyes that stare and decide if my navel is in the right place if my knees bend backward like the forelegs of a dog. They want to see if my tongue is split like a snake's or if my teeth are filing to points to chew them up. To know if I can spring out of the darkness and bite. Inside I am shrinking. I climb the streambed under watching eyes and know I am not the same. I am losing something with every step I take. I can feel the drain. Something precious is leaving me. I am a thing apart. With the letter I belong and am lawful. Without it I am a weak calf abandon by the herd, a turtle without shell, a minion with no telltale signs but a darkness I am born with, outside, yes, but inside as well and the inside dark is small, feathered and toothy. Is that what my mother knows? Why she chooses me to live without?\"</p> <p>At this point Florens has already had the first sense of self-loathing, where the people say they associate blackness with Satan, and after they've examined her body she feels like a different species under their gaze. Something has died in her, and everything looks like it's looking at her in that hostile way. The trees are looking at her, everything. And she's thinking if they are looking at her because she's black, and finding that a problem and possibly evil and satanic, then it's something she has to think about. Now that she's by herself, she thinks maybe they mean there's something inside of me that really is bad and maybe they're right? It's the crumbling of the psyche.</p>"
