  "<p>Barack Obama tried to resuscitate his campaign yesterday by mounting the most personal attack yet on John McCain, with an advert accusing the self-styled man of integrity and former Vietnam war hero of fighting a dishonourable and dishonest election campaign.</p> <p>The ad marked the start of what was billed as a Democratic fightback after a fortnight in which the Republicans dominated the news agenda and cut into and, in some instances, overtook Obama's lead in the polls.</p> <p>The stakes were underlined in a poll yesterday showing that McCain was leading Obama in Ohio - the state that decided the 2004 election. The Suffolk University poll put McCain on 46% compared with 42% for Obama. Voters also said they trusted McCain more than Obama.</p> <p>But the ad, with its focus on the tone of the election campaign, seemed out of touch on a day when public attention was focused on the Wall Street crisis.</p> <p>The time lag in Obama's campaign was underscored by the McCain camp's quick reaction in putting out an ad on the economy yesterday morning, called Crisis.</p> <p>\"Our economy in crisis. Only proven reformers John McCain and Sarah Palin can fix it,\" the ad opened.</p> <p>Obama's campaign later attempted to exploit McCain's insistence that the US economy was fundamentally strong.</p> <p>In its ad called Honour, Obama's camp said McCain was breaking a promise made in 2000 not to take the low road to the White House. The campaign team said: \"He's running one of the most dishonourable, dishonest campaigns Americans have ever seen and the campaign a person runs tells you a lot about the way they'll govern.\"</p> <p>The team cited ads by McCain that have accused Obama of supporting explicit sex education for five-year-olds, and sweeping tax rises.</p> <p>The Obama ad went to the heart of McCain's profile. The former navy pilot has built his reputation on abiding by a code of honour in which service to the country comes before personal advancement. The Republican's campaign slogan is Country First. The decision to go after McCain's character reflects nervousness within the Obama camp over the extent of the Republican poll gains and Sarah Palin's popularity.</p> <p>Obama's running mate, Joe Biden, also concentrated on McCain's personality during a speech in Saint Clair Shores, Michigan. He recalled that McCain had been the victim of scurrilous attacks during his unsuccessful battle for the Republican nomination against George Bush in 2000. \"And now, some of the very same people and the tactics he once deplored his campaign now employs,\" Biden said. </p> <p>By midday yesterday, Obama's team had switched its focus to the economy. But the slow pace of the shift will alarm Democrats already jittery about the way the campaign is being run.</p> <p>Obama called the fall of Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch \"the most serious financial crisis since the Great Depression\". He said he did not blame McCain, but \"I do fault the economic philosophy he subscribes to. It's a philosophy we've had for the last eight years - one that says we should give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else.\" </p> <p>McCain, in a statement issued before the markets opened, ruled out government help for Lehman Brothers and called for reform of Wall Street.</p>",
  "<p>A day of upheaval on global financial markets culminated last night in the heaviest fall in US share prices for almost seven years as the crisis that overwhelmed two of Wall Street's most prestigious banks broadened to threaten the survival of the world's largest insurance company.</p> <p>The US authorities were seeking to put together a $40bn rescue package for insurer AIG last night amid concern that bad investments compounded by the year-long credit crunch could send it into bankruptcy, similar to the demise of the investment bank Lehman Brothers.</p> <p>Lehman collapsed in a startling financial turn of events which saw another hallowed Wall Street name, Merrill Lynch, capitulate in a hastily arranged $50bn takeover by Bank of America.</p> <p>By the close of trading in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 504 points to 10,917 - its steepest points decline since the day the markets reopened after the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001 and the sixth biggest drop in the index's history.</p> <p>America's central bank, the Federal Reserve, threw AIG a lifeline by allowing the insurer to borrow $20bn from its subsidiaries' statutory reserves to avert a funding crisis which could drive it to the wall. But AIG needs more cash to avoid a downgrade in its credit rating which would undermine credibility in its insurance.</p> <p>Ten of the world's biggest banks, including Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Citibank, agreed late on Sunday to set up a $70bn emergency bailout fund intended to avert more failures.</p> <p>The 4,500 Lehman Brothers workers in London were clearing their desks yesterday as HBOS became the latest bank to feel the pressure from speculators. HBOS was adamant that it was a \"strong bank\" and still attracting deposits from customers.</p> <p>At one stage yesterday, its shares were down 36% and it was the main casualty in the City on a day that saw \u00a350bn wiped off the value of London's leading shares. The FTSE 100 index ended the day down 212.5 points at 5204.2 - a decline of 4%.</p> <p>The US treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, assured the public they could remain confident in the \"soundness and resilience\" of the financial system. He reserved the right to bail out struggling firms but said: \"We don't take lightly ever putting taxpayers' money on the line to support a financial institution.\"</p> <p>There were chaotic scenes outside Lehman Brothers' main office in midtown Manhattan as workers weaved past dozens of reporters gathered to witness the demise of one of the oldest names on Wall Street. \"Nobody knows anything about what is going on,\" said one trader. \"No one is doing anything. What am I going to do? Try and find a job.\"</p> <p>In London, traders commiserated with one another with hugs, shrugs and bottles accrued during the good years. Some spoke of careers nipped early in the bud. One trader learned he was fired as he turned up to work on his first day. \"We are worried we won't get this month's pay cheque on Friday,\" said Duo Ai, of the research department.</p> <p>With the financial crisis emerging as a key factor in the US presidential election, the Democrat candidate for the White House, Barack Obama, said last night that conditions were the most serious since the crash of the 1930s and that they exposed faults in the \"economic philosophy\" of his rival, John McCain. \"It's a philosophy we've had for the last eight years - one that says we should give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else.\"</p> <p>George Bush said: \"I know Americans are concerned about the adjustments taking place in our financial markets. At the White House and throughout my administration, we're focused on them. We're working to reduce disruptions and minimise the impact of these financial market developments on the broader economy.\"</p> <p>The mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, cancelled a trip to California to stay in touch with events. Government officials in the US are becoming increasingly concerned that public finances will suffer from plummeting tax revenue from Wall Street. The governor of New York state, David Paterson, said a lack of transparency by institutions was at the root of the problem: \"The idea of financial innovation has come back to bite us.\"</p> <p>In the UK, the Bank of England pumped \u00a35bn into the financial system to support banks, but the rising cost of borrowing in the City's money markets reflected the desire of institutions to hoard money rather than to lend it.</p> <p>The Financial Services Authority demanded minute-by-minute updates from UK institutions on their exposure to Lehman Brothers and was in close contact with the US authorities to assess the impact on London of weekend events in New York.</p> <p>The pressure on HBOS, the bank that attracts more savings in the UK than any other, prompted the shadow chancellor, George Osborne, to demand action. Vince Cable, Treasury spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, said: \"The collapse of Lehman Brothers is a stark example that the credit crunch is much broader and deeper than many hoped.</p> <p>\"Today's news shows the poison of bad credit continues to seep through the veins of the world's financial markets. With this collapse, it is clear the US government has drawn a line in the sand and is unlikely to bail out any further banks.\"</p> <p>Dominique Strauss-Kahn, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said further contraction of the global financial sector was inevitable but ruled out the possibility of a 1930s-style economic slump.</p> <p>\"The financial sector not only in the US but in the rest of the world at the end of the crisis is going to be smaller than the financial sector today,\" he said in Cairo. \"It's an important slowdown but it's not a very deep slowdown, it's more a protracted slowdown.\"</p> <p>Julian Jessop, chief international economist at Capital Economics, said: \"The US authorities' unwillingness to underwrite a rescue of Lehman Brothers marks a new phase of the continuing financial crisis. Further casualties look inevitable. Sooner or later the US treasury and the Fed had to draw the line and the financial sector will eventually be healthier as a result. However, the near-term outlook for the sector and the wider economy remains grim.\"</p> <p>Gerard Lyons, chief economist at Standard Chartered bank, said: \"The most significant event is the fact that the US authorities signalled that they are not going to step in and protect firms that do not pose a systemic risk.\"</p> <p>Lyons added that the tough stance adopted to Lehman's by the US treasury had encouraged John Thain, the chief executive of Merrill Lynch, to accept the takeover offer from Bank of America.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337623618\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>The new prime minister spoke about the future. The old president ranted about the past.</p> <p>Morgan Tsvangirai focused on hope. It may be a tough road ahead, said the man about to take over the day to day running of Zimbabwe, but the alternative was the rapidly looming abyss of a failed state. He promised swift action to get food to the millions on the brink of starvation and to lift the dead hand of oppression.</p> <p>There was no such vision from Robert Mugabe, who signed away 28 years of political domination yesterday by agreeing to share power only because he was looking into the same abyss and could offer no way out. He dredged up his favoured targets (Britain and the west), blamed his opponents for the country's economic collapse and the political violence, and offered a coded warning to the people with whom he will share government that they had better not be colonial stooges.</p> <p>But between the implied threats and recriminations, the old and new leaders of Zimbabwe promised commitment - begrudgingly in Mugabe's case - to making the deal work, while their supporters, celebrating in their thousands outside, could only guess at what it all means.</p> <p>The men and women in Zanu-PF and Movement for Democratic Change T-shirts singing and eyeing each other with caution agreed that the deal was historic. They agreed that Mugabe's days in power were numbered. But there were lots of doubts that the foes could work together.</p> <p>Tsvangirai said the deal for him to be prime minister while Mugabe clings on as president required painful compromises after eight years of struggle for democracy - after all, the people voted to make Tsvangirai the president. But it represented \"the return of hope\" for freedom from fear, poverty, hunger and oppression.</p> <p>\"I have signed this agreement because I believe it represents the best opportunity for us to build a peaceful, prosperous, democratic Zimbabwe. I have signed this agreement because my belief in Zimbabwe and its peoples runs deeper than the scars I bear from the struggle. I have signed this agreement because my hope for the future is greater than the grief I have for the needless suffering of the past years,\" he said.</p> <p>Mugabe did not see it as hope of a brighter country at all. \"There are a lot of things in the agreement I did not like and still do not like,\" he said. He was looking to blame and fell back on his favourite target, Britain, and how it wanted to get rid of him. But, he made clear, he is still there.</p> <p>\"They spoke of regime change and you heard them. They're still speaking of it. We had not done anything to Britain. Why, why, why the hand of the British? Why, why, why the hand of the Americans here?\" he said. He settled into a favoured theme: his seizure and redistribution of white-owned farms is irreversible - a \"salient principle\", as he calls it. He warned the MDC not to go against that.</p> <p>Mugabe finally got around to a half-hearted endorsement of the deal. \"We will do our best,\" he said while giving off the whiff of a defeated man seeing an unwelcome future before him.</p> <p>Outside the convention hall where the agreement was signed, in the shadow of the Zanu-PF headquarters, there was hope tempered by uncertainty and suspicion.</p> <p>Mugabe's supporters were generally pessimistic, including Willard, 23. \"It is not a good deal. We can't work with these people. Their principles are different. They are violent,\" he said, gesturing toward the MDC supporters. \"We need a better life. We need to drink beer every day.\"</p> <p>Some of the MDC supporters celebrated finally being able to demonstrate their political loyalties in public. But Mutindi Stanislous, a 52 year-old agriculturalist, remained cautious. \"It's not as good as we want, but for now we will accept it. We won the election. Zanu-PF lost. The leader of the MDC had to succumb to the pressure to save the people,\" he said. But Stanislous saw this as the beginning of the end for Mugabe.</p> <p>Tendai Myamakope, a jobless 27-year-old, agreed. \"We now know all Mugabe's tricks,\" he said. \"Everything's got an end. He's going - but slowly.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Iraqi government is in danger of pushing Sunni tribal leaders back into the arms of al-Qaida and re-igniting major violence across Iraq if it fails to take more Sunnis into the security forces, the country's leading Sunni politician has warned.</p> <p>Many tribal leaders who opposed the US occupation switched sides on promises of jobs in the previously Shia-dominated army and police. In a sign of the success of the so-called Awakening movement (al Sahwa), which is also known as the \"Sons of Iraq\", the US recently handed Anbar province - once a centre of the insurgency - back to Iraqi control. </p> <p>But in Diyala province, north of the capital, as well as in Baghdad suburbs, the Iraqi army and police have arrested dozens of al-Sahwa leaders in recent weeks because of their previous anti-American and anti-government activity. The government is dragging its feet on a pledge to take a fifth of the estimated 100,000 al-Sahwa members into the security forces. </p> <p>Iraq's vice-president, Tariq al-Hashimi, who heads the Iraqi Islamic party, said: \"The government is very hesitant, and I'm afraid if those groups and individuals are frustrated they might change their minds and instead of fighting al-Qaida and terrorism they will be back to offering them a safe haven, as they did in the past. This is a dangerous development. </p> <p>\"The Awakening groups have become genuine partners in tackling terrorism in Iraq and they should be rewarded rather than penalised,\" he said.</p> <p>His concerns were strongly echoed by Sheikh Mustafa Kamil Hamed, a leader of the powerful Jibouri tribe, who controls about 3,500 men in al-Doura, an area of farms and small towns east of Baghdad. Sporting a pistol and a leather belt of bullets across his white jalabiya, his story typifies the extraordinary zigzag of many Iraqi Sunnis. Once a resistance leader, he now proudly displays a medal from George Bush and boasts of entertaining General David Petraeus, the US commander in Iraq, at his headquarters, a small compound surrounded by blast walls and concrete watchtowers.</p> <p>Al-Qaida arrived in al-Doura in 2005, he said, kidnapping government employees, taking hostages, putting up fake checkpoints, and killing Shias. \"Al-Qaida pushed us hard to work with them. They even killed my brother's two sons. We said to them, 'If you've come to resist the US occupation, Iraq is an open field. You're free to do what you want but don't come here and kill our people,'\" the sheikh said.</p> <p>Gradually, he and his tribal colleagues decided to band together and resist al Qaida. The trend was replicated in other Sunni areas. The Americans saw what was happening and gave the Awakening movement money and other support. Now al Doura is crisscrossed with al-Sahwa and Iraqi army checkpoints. Displaced Shia families started to come home. But the mood in al-Doura changed last month with the arrest by the Iraqi army of two prominent al-Sahwa leaders.</p> <p>In Adhamiya, once of the most dangerous Sunni districts of Baghdad, the story is similar. Abu Abed Ali Bahjat has 400 al-Sahwa men under arms since he began to resist al-Qaida. They refuse to let Iraqi army and police, or US forces, into the suburb's rubble-strewn streets. Adhamiya was one of the worst areas during Baghdad's sectarian battles. Now Shia families are returning there too - around 300, according to Abu Abed, or roughly 60% of those who fled. </p> <p>Like Kamil Hamed, he is angry with the Shia-led government's apparent switch against al-Sahwa, blaming it on Iranian influence. </p> <p>Some Sunni leaders claim the prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, wants al-Sahwa disbanded by the end of the year. Gen Petraeus and other US officials have expressed guarded criticism of the delay in taking the promised 20,000 al-Sahwa members into the security forces, as they try to strike a balance between not undermining Maliki while assuring Sunnis.</p> <p>Kamil Hamed suspects the US supports the clampdown on al-Sahwa, whatever US officials say publicly. \"US forces are playing a cat-and-mouse game,\" he said. \"They cannot support al-Sahwa on the one hand and let the government arrest al-Sahwa leaders on the other. We restored security in this area but now are under threat. My personal feeling is the US has a special agenda to demolish al-Sahwa. We don't think the US cares.\"</p>",
  "<p>The former leader of the Liberal Democrats, Lord Ashdown, warned his party yesterday that there was a real chance of Afghanistan slipping into civil war.</p> <p>Appearing in Bournemouth, Ashdown released a memo he sent to the prime minister in December last year revealing advice he offered to the government, but told his audience that since then the situation in the country had worsened.</p> <p>Ashdown, whose foreign experience included four years as the EU's high representative to Bosnia and Herzegovina, was a contender to become the UN's envoy to Afghanistan but his appointment appeared to be blocked in January of this year, a month after the date of the memo he has brought to light this week.</p> <p>Speaking last night about events in the 10 months since his memo, Ashdown said: \"I fear there is nothing that has happened over the past year or so in Afghanistan which has caused me to alter this analysis. Indeed almost everything that has happened there makes me more gloomy that I was when I wrote this minute.\"</p> <p>The original memo Ashdown sent to the British government in December 2007 said: \"We do not have enough troops, aid or international will to make Afghanistan much different from what it has been for the last 1,000 years.\" Even if such resources were found, Ashdown wrote that he did not think it would be possible to turn the situation around within 25 years. </p> <p>Ashdown called for a regional agreement, similar to the Dayton peace agreement, involving all the regional players and especially Iran, saying he thought a change in the White House might be the answer. He said: \"A new president in the US might just be able to do this. Indeed, given [Barack] Obama's courageous statements in favour of multilateralism and dialogue with old enemies, he might well be the single person in the world best placed to pull off such an enterprise.\"</p>",
  "<p>Today, the anniversary of Mexico's declaration of independence from Spain, begins Hispanic Heritage Month in the US.</p> <p>Hispanic voters are expected to vote in unprecedented numbers this year, driven largely by concerns about the US immigration system. Polling like <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/108040/Candidate-Support-Race.aspx\">this one from Gallup</a> anticipates they will break strongly to the Democrats, possibly as much as 60% to 30%. </p> <p>Obama and McCain today distributed statements praising Hispanics' contributions to American society and their military service. Obama also called for comprehensive immigration reform. McCain didn't mention it. That's curious because <a href=\"http://www.ndn.org/hispanic/hispanicsrising-ii.pdf\">polling</a> [pdf] from Democratic research group NDN shows that immigration is the top concern for Hispanic voters.<br><br>Obama's full statement:</p> <blockquote> <p>This month, I join all Americans in celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month. It's a time to honor the achievements and sacrifices of Hispanic Americans, from their long and proud tradition of military service to the visionary leadership of C\u00e9sar Chavez to today's ongoing struggles for opportunity and prosperity. It's a time to recognize all Hispanic Americans who have helped write the social, economic, and cultural story of America.</p> <p>And after all the progress we have made together, we cannot turn back. We must march ahead. I've walked alongside the Hispanic community in Chicago, I've stood with you at immigration rallies, and I will fight for you in the White House. And now is the time for us to create good-paying jobs, reduce the student dropout rate, and finally enact the DREAM Act. It's time to finally pass comprehensive immigration reform, provide 15 million uninsured Latinos with affordable, high-quality health care, and end the war in Iraq. It's time to make sure the next four years don't look just like the last eight.<br> <br>At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to always march ahead. What has always distinguished the Hispanic community \u2013 and what distinguishes us as Americans \u2013 is our belief that in America, you can make it if you try. This month, and every month, we keep that promise. This November, we must renew it. </p> </blockquote> <p>McCain said:</p> <blockquote> <p>This month, we celebrate National Hispanic Heritage Month by honoring the many contributions that Hispanic Americans make each and every day to the United States. Our country would be poorer were we deprived of the patriotism, industry and decency of Hispanic Americans who have made this country better and stronger. We honor those who have come here to live the American dream, we recognize those who have been here for generations, and we thank those who are serving our nation in uniform here and overseas.</p> <p>Up until mid-2007 McCain was a strong proponent of comprehensive immigration reform, the short-cut name for a programme that would establish a path to legal status for the 12m illegal aliens already here and create some sort of guest worker programme for those who want to enter the country and take jobs Americans don't want. But he tracked to the right during the Republican primary, when the candidates tried to out do each other with tougher rhetoric and policy pronouncements on the issue.</p> <p>The Republican party also released a statement praising Hispanics' military service and dedication to our government through their \"large participation in record numbers in the current Republican Administration. But no mention of immigration there either.</p> </blockquote> <p>NDN President <a href=\"http://www.ndn.org/about/team/simonrosenberg.html\">Simon Rosenberg</a> said McCain is in a jam. He said McCain knows that Hispanics are a key bloc this year but can't buck the anti-immigration right. Rosenberg thinks that is why McCain didn't mention immigration in the statement.</p> <blockquote> <p>He's in a very tough position. The position that he took the win the Republican nomination was to move away from his traditional advocacy for immigration reform, which may have helped him win the Republican nomination. But it's hurting him with Hispanics. He's going to have to live with those consequences.</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>I've been having strange emotions recently. Somehow, I have become nostalgic for <a href=\"http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/\">Ronald Reagan</a>. It's a somewhat bizarre feeling to have, since I've always thought Reagan's election represented one of the great calamities in modern American history. So let me explain.</p> <p>Reagan was a smiling, genial extremist. He promised a new dawn for a country that suddenly seemed no longer young; a new lease of life for an American Dream beset by uncertainty in the post-Vietnam war years. Sure, his prescriptions to cure America of its ills were either batty or dangerous, or both: the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/270292.stm\">\"voodoo economics\"</a> derided by George Herbert Walker Bush during the 1980 primary season; a bulked-up military engaged in continual nuclear Russian roulette with the Soviet Union; a turn toward religious fundamentalism that <a href=\"http://www.larouchepub.com/other/1995/2241_afghansi_intro.html\">regarded Afghan mujahadeen forces</a> (yes, the ones who ultimately made Osama bin Laden the powerful maniac that he is) as allies in a cosmic, Manichean battle, while regarding gays and abortion providers in the US as little better than stooges of Satan. But, let's be fair, he smiled as he prognosticated, and he genuinely believed he was ushering in the good times. </p> <p>Moreover, however crazy Reagan's ideas were, at least in 1980 when he first got elected, he could plausibly claim, in his oh-so-soothing voice, to be running against a raft of failed policies and programmes enacted by the presidents before him. I don't like the changes Reagan pushed through, but give the man his dues: at least, to use current vernacular, he was a genuine change agent. He ran against the status quo not just with words but with specific policy differences.</p> <p>The contrast with John McCain and Sarah Palin is stark. </p> <p>The Republican party, dominated by the hard-right personnel who rose to power during the Reagan presidency, has controlled the White House for 20 of the last 28 years. They have gutted the social programmes handed down from the New Deal years. They have weakened organised labor and redistributed the country's tax burden away from corporations and wealthy individuals and toward the poor and middle class. They have remade the supreme court and corroded the supposedly iron-clad barriers between church and state. They have reshaped American military and foreign policy, moving it away from a reliance on international alliances and organisations and toward a more muscular, unilateralist posture. They have stood in the way of environmental protection and successfully blocked moves toward universal healthcare coverage. Quite a record.</p> <p>And yet, at the end of all of this, with less than two months until the election, John McCain, who has served as a Republican senator since shortly after Reagan first got elected, is now running for the presidency as a man of change. Yes, the Republicans have failed miserably, he tells America, and that's why you need to elect him, a Republican, to fix things.</p> <p>Not too long ago, McCain was running as the candidate of \"experience\", the only one capable of making the careful decisions needed to protect America and her allies in an age of mass terror. I didn't agree with his positions, but at least the old soldier was making an honourable, principled and intelligent case to voters \u2013 and, in talking about foreign policy and terrorism, at least he was addressing issues of genuine global import. He came off as smart, and even though he didn't have the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jun/06/usa.paulharris2\">Gipper's Hollywood smile</a>, he also appeared to be rather likeable.</p> <p>In the weeks leading up to last week's 9/11 anniversary, however, the 72-year-old McCain has stopped talking about experience, about the need for stability in troubled times, and instead begun touting his \"change\" credentials. And, in undergoing this metamorphosis, he has, to my mind, become infinitely less likeable.</p> <p>His primary rationale for such an outlandish claim? His choice of the young and inexperienced Sarah Palin as his running mate. Palin certainly is an outsider, but in terms of change, her <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1837918,00.html\">social</a> and <a href=\"http://useconomy.about.com/od/candidatesandtheeconomy/p/Palin_Economy.htm\">economic</a> views seem to be largely in lock-step with those of President Bush, perhaps just a tad to the right of him. As for abortion, the \"wedge issue\" Republicans have successfully used from Reagan onward to win a significant number of working-class votes away from the Democrats, Palin is fiercely against choice, but then so was Reagan, so was Bush senior, so is Bush junior. And none of them really made very much effort to criminalise abortion \u2013 because they all knew that, were they to do so, they'd be left with a rump party of fundamentalists and hardly anyone else. </p> <p>McCain's playing the same cynical game here: shore up the conservative base by anointing Palin as VP, get into power and then, apart from periodically launching a few rhetorical jibes at pro-choice politicians, ignore the issue for the next four years. Talk change on abortion, then propose even more tax cuts for the wealthy. Pledge a new social compact, and then continue the same know-nothing policies which have given Bush the <a href=\"http://pollster.com/polls/us/jobapproval-bush.php\">lowest popularity ratings</a> of any president in American history.</p> <p>That's a snow job of the first order. It's the prestige part of the magic trick, the successful imprinting of an illusion on the audience's mind. </p> <p>For magic to work, the audience has to suspend disbelief and be willing to believe in what it thinks it sees. Reagan was a terrific magician, with his smile and grandfatherly persona, he made it easy for voters to believe in his message. It's possible that McCain's strategy will work, too. Certainly the polls suggest his campaign has finally achieved traction. He could very well get elected based on his tacking to the right while at the same time claiming to be a change agent out to rescue America from the failed policies that he continues to advocate.</p> <p>But McCain isn't nearly so skillful a magician as Reagan. If the Palin choice and the change rhetoric propels him to a victory in November it will say more about the audience than the magician, more about the gullibility of crowds than the flawless execution of the trick itself.</p>",
  "<p>As the smoke starts clearing from <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/16/business/worldbusiness/16markets.html?hp\">Wall Street's massive meltdown</a> on the weekend, one question has only begun to be raised: Why did the Bush administration engineer a quick rescue for Bear Stearns earlier this year but allow Lehman Brothers to flame out into bankruptcy?</p> <p>One <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/adf47e74-8312-11dd-907e-000077b07658.html\">compelling explanation</a> is, essentially, that the government's gamble on Bear failed to calm the markets and intervention in Lehman's case would do little but expose the taxpayers to greater risk.</p> <p>But here's <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2008/09/brothers-grim-is-lehman-next.html\">an interesting statistic</a>: Of the political donations given to current members of Congress by Lehman and its employees, Democrats got 72% and Republicans 28%. The company has sent more than three times more money overall to Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton than it has to John McCain.</p> <p>As for Bear Stearns, it was <a href=\"http://www.nysun.com/national/new-york-city-investment-banks-give-more-money/52818/\">reported earlier this year</a> that Rudy Giuliani was the firm's favoured recipient of presidential campaign donations. Leaving aside this election cycle, when Bear's political action committee raised just $5,000, its giving pattern looks like a flip-side of Lehman: 75% of its donations went to Republicans in 2006, with a 61% Republican share in 2004.</p> <p>So in Palin parlance, what's the difference between Bear and Lehman? Not lipstick, but perhaps political giving patterns.</p>",
  "<p>Joe Biden gave<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0908/13460.html\"> a good, tough speech</a> in Michigan today. For example:<br></p> <blockquote> <p><br>\"The campaign a person runs tells everything about the way they'll govern,\" Biden said. \"The McCain-Palin campaign decided to bet the house on the politics perfected by Karl Rove.

  "<p>Share prices tumbled around the world today as the most turbulent 24 hours since the start of the credit crunch 13 months ago saw the US insurance giant AIG and Britain's biggest mortgage lender, HBOS, touted as the next victims of the global crisis that claimed Lehman Brothers at the weekend.</p> <p>The US authorities were tonight seeking to put together a $40bn rescue package for AIG amid concerns that its collapse would have ripple effects through an already-vulnerable financial system and add to the growing risk of a global recession. America's central bank, the Federal Reserve, tonight appointed Morgan Stanley to review the options for the troubled insurer and make an assessment of the risks posed to the US financial system by its collapse. </p> <p>Shares in Asia and Europe fell heavily after Sunday night's announcement that Lehman Brothers, America's fourth biggest investment bank, had collapsed and that the third biggest, Merrill Lynch, was being taken over by Bank of America, which has emerged as the new giant of Wall Street following the turmoil of the weekend. Ten of the world's biggest banks, including Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Citibank late on Sunday agreed to set up a $70bn emergency bail-out fund intended to avert further failures.</p> <p>The 4,500 Lehman Brothers workers in London were today clearing their desks as HBOS became the latest bank to feel the pressure from speculators. At one stage today, HBOS shares were down 34% and it was the main casualty in the City of a day that saw \u00a350bn wiped off the value of London's leading shares. The FTSE 100 index ended the day down 212.5 points at 5204.2 - a decline of 4%.</p> <p>Hopes of a Washington bail-out for AIG combined with a $5 fall in oil prices helped limit the early losses on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average had dropped by 300 points by lunchtime in New York. </p> <p>The US treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, assured the public that they can remain confident in the \"soundness and resilience\" of the financial system. He reserved the right to bail out future struggling firms but said: \"We don't take lightly ever putting taxpayers' money on the line to support a financial institution.\"</p> <p>There were chaotic scenes outside Lehman Brothers' main office in midtown Manhattan as workers weaved past dozens of reporters who had gathered to witness the demise of one of the oldest names on Wall Street. \"Nobody knows anything about what is going on,\" said one trader. \"No one is doing anything. What am I going to? Try and find a job. I am not at all confident in the current markets but you do what you can.\"</p> <p>Another described the atmosphere inside the building as \"pretty flat\". He said; \"There is not much noise. There is a bit of desk clearing going on, there has been desk clearing going since the weekend. There is some disbelief at the speed at which this happened.\"</p> <p>With the financial crisis emerging as a key factor in the US presidential election, the Democrat candidate for the White House, Barack Obama, said tonight that conditions were the most serious since the crash of the 1930s and that they exposed faults in the \"economic philosophy\" of his rival John McCain. \"It's a philosophy we've had for the last eight years \u2014 one that says we should give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else.\"</p> <p>George Bush said: \"I know Americans are concerned about the adjustments that are taking place in our financial markets. At the White House and throughout my administration, we're focused on them. We're working to reduce disruptions and minimize the impact of these financial market developments on the broader economy.\"</p> <p>The mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, hastily cancelled a trip to California in order to stay in touch with the broadening financial crisis. Government officials in the US are becoming increasingly concerned that public finances will suffer from plummeting tax revenue from Wall Street. The governor of New York state, David Paterson, said a lack of transparency by institutions was at the root of the problem: \"The idea of financial innovation has come back to bite us.\"</p> <p>In the UK, the Bank of England pumped \u00a35bn into the financial system to support banks, but the rising cost of borrowing in the City's money markets reflected the desire of institutions to hoard money rather than to lend it. The Financial Services Authority demanded minute-by-minute updates from UK institutions on their exposure to Lehman Brothers and was in close contact with the US authorities to assess the impact on London of weekend events in New York.</p> <p>The pressure on HBOS, the bank that attracts more savings in the UK than any other, prompted the shadow chancellor George Osborne to demand action to protect UK depositors.</p> <p>Vince Cable, Treasury spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, said: \"The collapse of Lehman Brothers is a stark example that the credit crunch is much broader and deeper than many hoped. Today's news shows the poison of bad credit continues to seep through the veins of the world's financial markets. With this collapse, it is clear the US Government has drawn a line in the sand and is unlikely to bail out any further banks.\" </p> <p>Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said further contraction of the global financial sector was inevitable but ruled out the possibility of a 1930's-style economic slump. \"The financial sector not only in the US but in the rest of the world at the end of the crisis is going to be smaller than the financial sector today,\" he said in Cairo. \"The financial sector will shrink.\" Strauss-Kahn added: \"It's an important slowdown but it's not a very deep slowdown, it's more a protracted slowdown.\"</p> <p>Julian Jessop, chief international economist at Capital Economics said: \"The US authorities' unwillingness to underwrite a rescue of Lehman Brothers marks a new phase of the continuing financial crisis. Further casualties look inevitable. Sooner or later the US Treasury and the Fed had to draw the line and the financial sector will eventually be healthier as a result. However, the near-term outlook for the sector and the wider economy remains grim.\"</p> <p>Gerard Lyons, chief economist at Standard Chartered bank, said: \"The most significant event is the fact that the US authorities signalled that they are not going to step in and protect firms that do not pose a systemic risk.\" Lyons added that the tough stance adopted to Lehman's by the US Treasury had encouraged John Thain, the chief executive of Merrill Lynch, to accept the takeover offer from Bank of America.</p>",
  "<p>Ya think McCain's advance team was being a little over-confident? I had a feeling last week when they announced that he and Palin would start campaigning separately that it would be embarrassing for this, but I didn't think it'd be <a href=\"http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/news_politics/files/mccainrally.jpeg\">this bad</a>.

  "<p>One of the most famous <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIyewCdXMzk\">political attack ads</a> in US history hails from the <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4D81F3BF930A1575AC0A966958260\">1990 Senate race</a> between white Republican Jesse Helms and African-American Democrat Harvey Gantt. The text of the ad read:</p> <blockquote> <p>You needed that job. And you were the best qualified. But they had to give it to a minority, because of a racial quota. Is that really fair? Harvey Gantt says it is.</p> <p>You'll vote on this issue next Tuesday. For racial quotas: Harvey Gantt. Against racial quotas: Jesse Helms.</p> </blockquote> <p>Another <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4D81F3BF930A1575AC0A966958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2\">Helms ad</a> read:</p> <blockquote> <p>Harvey Gantt is asking you and me to approve of some pretty awful things. Aborting a child in the final weeks of pregnancy. Aborting a child because it is a girl instead of a boy. That's too liberal. Harvey Gantt is asking us to approve some pretty extreme views to vote for him.</p> </blockquote> <p>Gantt denied that he would allow abortion for sex selection, but the mud stuck. Helms exploited the vehemence with which very conservative voters hate reproductive choice and used it to smear Gantt to defeat. Helms, like John McCain and Sarah Palin, supported outlawing of abortion with one exception: when the life of the pregnant woman is endangered. (Palin believes mothers who are raped, or girls who are the victims of incest should be forced to have their attacker's baby. John McCain <a href=\"http://www.lifenews.com/nat4296.html\">wants Roe v Wade overturned</a>.) </p> <p>In American political advertising, accusing your opponent of taking extreme political positions is one of the oldest tricks in the book. Truth is entirely optional, and marrying race baiting with extremism is often one of the most effective tactics. </p> <p>Reading coverage of the Gantt-Helms race (which Helms won) I'm eerily reminded of how the Obama-McCain race is shaping up. Sex has surfaced again in Election 2008, and McCain's recent ad is heir to the Helms tradition of hate and fear-mongering. In his latest attack ad, McCain says Obama is \"wrong for your family\" and cites:</p> <blockquote> <p>Obama's one accomplishment? Legislation to teach \"comprehensive sex education\" to kindergartners. Learning about sex before learning to read?</p> </blockquote> <p>The ad is <a href=\"http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/09/new_mccain_ad_badly_distorts_o_1.php\">downright</a> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/11/us/politics/11checkpoint.html?bl&amp;ex=1221278400&amp;en=139555dd265b8c71&amp;ei=5087%0A\">false</a>. And, as several people have noted, it's not an accident that Obama is shown superimposed in front of a shot of all white kindergartners. Yet again, we have the right wing showing \"extreme\" black politicians endangering white America. From Gantt to Willie Horton to Harold Ford in Tennessee, it's an old Republican favourite. And by God, it seems to work. When all else fails, roll out the culture wars. Sex ed, abortion and gays are guaranteed red meat. </p> <p>Usually, Democrats roll their eyes and throw up their hands. But what am I hearing from Democrats all over Massachusetts, New York and Washington DC? \"No more money to Obama 'til he fights back against this.\"</p> <p>On <a href=\"http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/09/new_mccain_ad_badly_distorts_o_1.php\">Talking Points Memo</a>, ThatshowIseeit writes: \"I am sick of belonging to a party that does nothing while Republicans distort facts and win election after election. Attack and do whatever it takes to win this election.\"</p> <p>Is this going to be the year the Democrats fight back? I don't care about the real meaning of lipstick. I want Obama to tear these lying pols apart. And I am far, far from alone. Most Democrats are desperate for it. McCain and Palin take really extreme, outside the mainstream positions, and Americans need to hear about it. </p> <p>Here's a good place to start: When she was mayor of Wasilla, Palin charged sexual assault victims or their insurance companies for <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-09-10-rape-exams_N.htm\">ordering rape kits</a>. Apparently she and her government didn't want to put a \"burden\" on the taxpayer. </p> <p>As John Aravosis <a href=\"http://www.americablog.com/2008/09/more-media-pick-up-on-story-that-palin.html\">writes</a>, the rape kit issue would hit McCain and \"drive a wedge between him and women and independents. To put McCain and Palin on the side of rapists versus rape victims. To change the discussion of the entire week from lipstick and fish to a real issue that scares the hell out of women, and men, across America.\"</p> <p>Imagine a young girl who's been raped and not only has to come forward and deal with the complicated and often humiliating process of a rape allegation, but who has to pay a couple hundred dollars for proof of her attack, or ask her parents about their insurance plan? I'd like to see this story framed in an attack ad. \"McCain-Palin think victims should pay for being raped.\"</p>",

  "<p>Barack Obama attempted to resuscitate his campaign today by mounting the most personal attack yet on John McCain, with an ad accusing the self-styled man of integrity and former Vietnam war hero of fighting a dishonourable and dishonest election campaign.</p> <p>The advert marked the start of what was billed as a Democratic fightback after a fortnight in which the Republicans - and particularly McCain's running mate Sarah Palin - dominated the news agenda and cut into and in some instances overtaken Obama's poll leads.</p> <p>The stakes were underlined in a new poll today showing that McCain is now leading Obama in Ohio - the state that decided the 2004 election. The Suffolk University poll put McCain on 46% compared to 42% for Obama. Voters also said they trusted the Republican more than Obama.</p> <p>However, the ad, with its focus on the tone of the election campaign, seemed out-of-touch on a day when public attention was focused on the Wall Street crisis.</p> <p>The time lag by Obama was underscored by the McCain camp's quick reaction in putting out an ad on the economy this morning, called Crisis.</p> <p>\"Our economy in crisis. Only proven reformers John McCain and Sarah Palin can fix it,\" the ad opened.</p> <p>The Obama campaign later attempted to exploit McCain's insistence that the US economy was fundamentally strong.</p> <p>In its ad called Honour, the Obama camp claimed that McCain was breaking a promise made in 2000 not to take the low road to the White House.</p> <p>The campaign team said: \"He's running one of the most dishonourable, dishonest campaigns Americans have ever seen and the campaign a person runs tells you a lot about the way they'll govern.\"</p> <p>The team cited ads by McCain which have accused Obama of supporting explicit sex education for 5-year olds, and sweeping tax rises.</p> <p>The Obama ad goes to the heart of McCain's profile. The former Navy pilot has built his reputation on abiding by a code of honour in which service to the country supposedly comes before personal advancement. The Republican's campaign slogan is Country First.</p> <p>The decision to go after McCain's character reflects nervousness within the Obama camp over the extent of the Republican poll gains and Palin's popularity.</p> <p>Obama's running mate, Joe Biden, who has maintained a low national profile since the Democratic convention in Denver last month, also concentrated on McCain's personality during a speech in Saint Clair Shores, Michigan.</p> <p>He recalled that McCain had been the victim of scurrilous attacks during his unsuccessful battle for the Republican nomination against George Bush in 2000. \"And now, some of the very same people and the tactics he once deplored his campaign now employs. The same campaign that once called for a town hall a week is now launching a low blow a day,\" Biden said.</p> <p>\"But what really bothers me, is that every punch thrown at us - is an attempt to distract you. And they can be plenty distracting.\"</p> <p>By the midday, Obama's team had switched its focus fully to the economy. But the slow shift will alarm Democrats already jittery about the way the election is being run.</p> <p>Obama spent yesterday in Chicago with his team looking at how to regain the initiative and stuck with the personal attack on McCain, even though the US media was widely reporting all that day the prospect of trouble in Wall Street.</p> <p>The economy is the number one election issue and Obama is trying to link McCain to Bush, whom voters blame for the crisis.</p> <p>Obama called the fall of Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch \"the most serious financial crisis since the Great Depression\". He said he did not blame McCain, but \"I do fault the economic philosophy he subscribes to.</p> <p>It's a philosophy we've had for the last eight years - one that says we should give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else.\"</p> <p>Biden, meanwhile, said a McCain presidency would simply be a sequel to George Bush.</p> <p>The Republican candidate, in a statement issued before the markets opened, ruled out government help for Lehman Brothers and called for major reform of Wall Street. </p>",
  "<p>In my first post, I said I was watching issues like healthcare, the US national debt and the general economy. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselectionroadtrip/2008/sep/13/uselections2008.useconomicgrowth?commentid=f00f0218-37ca-4ba0-a843-da73d8f0d50c\">Commenter palmeranian said</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>This race will not be won or lost based on the three issues you are watching.

A <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/107458/Abortion-Issue-Laying-Low-2008-Campaign.aspx\">Gallup poll in May showed that abortion</a>, one of the hot button issues of the culture war, wasn't important to 37% of voters and only one factor in many for 49% of voters. The latest Newsweek poll showed that the <a href=\"http://www.pollingreport.com/prioriti.htm\">economy topped the of voters' concerns.</a>.</p> <p>Wall Street's problems have already been spilling out onto Main Street.

Or is palmeranian right? Will the culture war continue to drive the polls in McCain's direction? </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0908/13435.html\">Mike Allen at Politico</a> thinks this crisis is too big to be ignored, but it's not clear which candidate it will help or hurt. He writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>America's banking instability could upend the final 50 days of the presidential campaign, with both candidates forced to confront a calamity that has gotten only glancing attention during the first 20 months of the race for the White House. ... Red flags about the nation's economic infrastructure have been popping up at least since the collapse in March of the investment bank Bear Stearns. But neither Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) nor Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) has talked in detail about the potential consequences for voters and the government.</p> </blockquote> <p>This economic crisis is a chaotic event. It's not something that will naturally benefit either candidate. Both campaigns will rush to frame it in a way that helps them. It's an early test of the candidates, but it's also a difficult test for the nation.</p> <p>UDPATE: Nate Silver at the excellent blog <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com\">fivethirtyeight.com</a> <br>doesn't think the Wall Street meltdown will have that much impact. (Nate and Co. use some <a href=\"http://www.onthemedia.org/transcripts/2008/09/05/03\">ingenious baseball-inspired statistical analysis</a> to predict the results of the Electoral College and hence the election.) He writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>People nevertheless seem to think that this will be some sort of linchpin event in the campaign. I don't necessarily buy that, because I think that most voters grasp intuitively that markets are markets, and that policymakers have less to do with their direction than they might with something like job creation.</p> </blockquote>",

Barack Obama owns no portion whatsoever of either the Chicago White Sox or the Chicago Cubs (even though he's still the snooty elitist and all, see how it works?).</p> <p>So it is pleasing to note that the D-Backs, who led their division much of the season, have lately really choked and have almost played themselves out of a playoff spot. They're under .500 now and trail the Dodgers by 4.5 games. Basically at this point, the Dodgers would have to go 4-9 in their remaining 13 games, and the D-Backs 10-4 in their remaining 14, for the D-Backs to overtake the LAers. Not likely.</p> <p>Meanwhile, both Chicago teams (Obama, a south-sider, prefers the Sox) lead their divisions. A Cubbies pitcher even threw a no-hitter yesterday.

There's a problem here. As Marc Ambinder <a href=\"http://marcambinder.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/09/what_we_learned_the_weekend.php\">puts it</a>: \"The McCain campaign has gone thoroughly postmodern on us. Truth? Schmuth? It's all a struggle for power. And if the Obama campaign agrees with the media on a certain truth, it might be suspect...\"</p>",
  "<p>It was pretty clear from yesterday's papers that we've just entered Phase II of Palinophilia.</p> <p>Phase I was the Palin-as-phenomenon phase. Since everyone had barely heard of her when McCain named her, there was an inevitable period of \"Gee, who is this woman?\" coverage. </p> <p>That kind of coverage of someone who has burst onto a scene, whether in politics or business or sports-wth-an-s or whatever, tends inevitably toward the positive. It's never <em>all</em> positive, and it certainly wasn't that in Palin's case, because we had the revelation about the daughter's pregnancy and a few other things. But basically it's personality-driven coverage, highlighting the person's hobbies and likes and dislikes and alleged values. And she has a personality that many Americans like, and of course she did deliver a crowd-pleasing speech in St Paul, so Phase I worked largely to her benefit.</p> <p>But now we've clearly entered Phase II, in which the journalism is less about personality and more about policy and her record. The results are consierably less flattering.</p> <p>I count four important pieces in just the last two days. The one that's attracted the most attention is yesterday's <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/14/us/politics/14palin.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;hp\">huge New York Times takeout</a> on how she's governed Alaska. Required reading if you haven't delved into it. The portrait here is of a deeply insecure person with at once a wobbly command of government and fiercely ideological world view (a great combination!) whose administration abused power to conceal the first fact and enforce the second:</p> <blockquote> <p>Interviews show that Ms Palin runs an administration that puts a premium on loyalty and secrecy. The governor and her top officials sometimes use personal email accounts for state business; dozens of e-mail messages obtained by the New York Times show that her staff members studied whether that could allow them to circumvent subpoenas seeking public records.</p> <p>Rick Steiner, a University of Alaska professor, sought the email messages of state scientists who had examined the effect of global warming on polar bears. (Ms Palin said the scientists had found no ill effects, and she has sued the federal government to block the listing of the bears as endangered.) An administration official told Mr Steiner that his request would cost $468,784 to process.</p> <p>When Mr Steiner finally obtained the email messages \u2014 through a federal records request \u2014 he discovered that state scientists had in fact agreed that the bears were in danger, records show.</p> <p>\"Their secrecy is off the charts,\" Mr Steiner said.</p> </blockquote> <p>I don't know what will come of this. But the idea that a gubernatorial administration anywhere in this country secretly decided that they should all discuss governance and patronage issues using their personal email accounts rather than governmental ones is a very serious matter. The Bush White House <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_White_House_e-mail_controversy\">deleted -- er, \"lost\" -- up to 5 million emails</a> related to the US attorneys scandal. If the White House weren't ignoring subpoeans and flouting the law, this face alone may well have been enough to warrant impeachment proceedings. </p> <p>Even more damning in some ways was yesterday's Washington Post piece about how Palin ran Wasilla. In most towns in most states, mayors at least have to oversee four basic things: police, fire, schools and garbage pickup. But of these Palin apparently didn't even have to deal with three of them:</p> <blockquote> <p>Firefighting and schools, two of the main elements of local governance, are handled by the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, the regional government for a huge swath of central Alaska. The state has jurisdiction over social services and environmental regulations such as stormwater management for building projects.</p> <p>With so many government services in the state subsidized by oil revenue, and with no need to provide for local schools, Wasilla has also made do with a very low property tax rate -- cut altogether by Palin's successor -- sparing it from the tax battles that localities elsewhere must deal with. Instead, the city collects a 2 percent sales tax, the bulk of which is paid by people who live outside town and shop at its big-box stores.</p> <p>The mayor oversees a police department created three years before Palin took office; the public works department; the parks and recreation department; a planning office; a library; and a small history museum. Council meetings are in the low-ceilinged basement of the town hall, a former school, and often the only residents who show up to testify are two gadflies. When Palin was mayor, the population was just 5,500.</p> <p>Palin limited her duties further by hiring a deputy administrator to handle much of the town's day-to-day management. Her top achievement as mayor was the construction of an ice rink, a project that landed in the courts and cost the city more than expected.</p> <p>Arriving in office, Palin herself played down the demands of the job in response to residents who worried that her move to oust veteran officials would leave the town in the lurch. \"It's not rocket science,\" Palin said, according to the town newspaper, the Frontiersman. \"It's $6 million and 53 employees.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>In GOP-spin world, Palin has vast \"executive experience.\" In reality world, this is a joke. And yes a governor has more responsibility. But even there Alaska is unique, because the presence of the oil revenues and the lack of a large poor population combine to virtually ensure that as long as out-and-out corruption is avoided, the state will always have the income to provide basic services.</p> <p>Third, <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/id/158738\">a fascinating Newsweek piece</a> on Palin's firing of her first police commissioner. In one of the few areas of actual responsibility she did have, she axed a seemingly competent cop in part because he thought letting citizens carry guns in bars <em>and schools</em> was a bad idea. Palin opposed him:</p> <blockquote> <p>Stambaugh, a former Anchorage police captain who once supervised Monegan, was hired as Wasilla's first police chief in 1993 and created the town's small police force, says former Wasilla mayor John Stein. But weeks after Palin beat Stein in 1996, she expressed displeasure with the chief. One big issue, Stambaugh said, was that he and other police chiefs had opposed a state-legislature bill to permit concealed weapons in schools and bars, which Stambaugh called \"craziness.\" But Palin, elected with backing from the National Rifle Association, which lobbied for the bill, told him she was \"not happy\" with his position, and that the NRA wanted him fired, says Stambaugh. Palin told him he \"shouldn't have done that,\" Stambaugh told Newsweek. (Palin denied in a deposition that the NRA contacted her about the weapons bill.)</p> <p>An even bigger clash involved a proposed city ordinance backed by Stambaugh to close the town bars at 2 a.m. instead of 5. Stambaugh says he believed this would help curb late-night drunken driving at a time when, according to Stein, the former mayor, \"people were driving out from Anchorage to the valley for more alcohol and crashing.\" But Palin, as a council member, had voted against the measure\u2014making her the favored candidate among bar owners, one of whom held a fund-raiser for her. Records obtained by NEWSWEEK show that Wasilla bar owners contributed $1,250 to her mayoral campaign\u2014more than 10 percent of all the money she raised in 1996. Griffin did not respond to requests for comment on those contributions.</p> </blockquote> <p>Fourth, the Wall Street Journal <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122143893857134389.html\">reports</a> today, in light of McCain's comments last Friday that Palin had sought no earmarks as governor, that that is just a flat-out lie:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>Last week, Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain said his running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, hadn't sought earmarks or special-interest spending from Congress, presenting her as a fiscal conservative. But state records show Gov. Palin has asked U.S. taxpayers to fund $453 million in specific Alaska projects over the past two years.</p> <p>These projects include more than $130 million in federal funds that would benefit Alaska's fishing industry and an additional $9 million to help Alaska oil companies. She also has sought $4.5 million to upgrade an airport on a Bering Sea island that has a year-round population of less than 100.</p> </blockquote> <p>If all this is true, why is she so popular? Fair question. She's likeable, as I said. She sold the airplane (which is something you can only do once). She taxed the oil companies and gave the money to the people. And she operates in secrecy, shiedling the bad news, which is a pretty easy thing for a governor in a small state with a small in-state media to do. As the governor said herself, it's not rocket science. Let's hope the US media stays on top of it.</p>",
  "<p>The McCain-Palin ticket has developed an interesting campaign strategy. They don't want the public to see their plans to dismantle social security, Medicare and the system of employer-provided healthcare. To distract people from these policies that will directly affect their lives they are taking politics to new lows.</p> <p>Among the highlights for the cesspool two is the nonsense that Barack Obama was calling Sarah Palin a barnyard animal when he used the old expression <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0908/Obama_Lipstick_on_a_pig.html\">\"putting lipstick on a pig\"</a>. Then John McCain told us that he approved of <a href=\"http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/09/new_mccain_ad_badly_distorts_o_1.php\">an ad</a> calling Obama a sexual pervert. </p> <p>These two are happy to throw out any sort of vile lie because the more time the media and the public spend focusing on this garbage, the less time they will have to notice that McCain wants to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/25/johnmccain.economy\">privatise and cut their social security</a>. McCain thinks that America's workers have it too easy when they retire. He wants them to retire later and have less money when they do.</p> <p>In addition to cutting social security, he is also likely to cut Medicare benefits. He has railed about \"entitlements\" in the past, and because of our broken healthcare system, Medicare is the most rapidly growing entitlement. McCain has also supported measures that increase the cost of Medicare by subsidising private insurers that take part in the programme. In other words, McCain is likely to reduce Medicare benefits in order to increase the profits of private insurers.</p> <p>McCain has also explicitly targeted the system of employer-based health insurance through which most non-elderly people get their coverage. McCain proposes to take away the tax deduction for employer-provided insurance, a seeming violation of his no-tax-increase pledge. (McCain would provide <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/04/29/mccain.healthcare/index.html\">a $2,500 tax credit</a> for buying insurance.) </p> <p>Under McCain's plan, the money that employers pay for health insurance would be taxed in the same way as money paid in wages. That means that workers would pay taxes on money that they never see in their paycheques. When insurers increase their premiums, employers would have to pull more money out of workers paycheques for taxes, even if they covered the full cost of the premium hike. This means that workers see their take-home pay cut every time insurers raise premiums.</p> <p>As an employer, I can guarantee that this will create a big headache and no doubt lead many employers to just drop health insurance coverage. Dealing with insurance companies is bad enough. Having to constantly explain to your workers why their pay is falling is too much. </p> <p>McCain's plan will soon destroy the system of employer-based insurance, which is undoubtedly its intention. Before long, the vast majority of people will have to shop individually for their healthcare. This will lead to enormous waste of time as tens of millions of families will have to ask questions like: \"Do you want the plan that's good on cancer but bad on heart disease, or the plan that's bad on cancer but good on heart disease?\" </p> <p>Even worse, the people who have serious health problems and most need insurance will find it extremely expensive, if not impossible, to get insurance coverage. See, insurance companies don't like to insure sick people. They lose money on them. They have no choice if they get an employer-based pool that includes mostly healthy people, but also some with health problems. </p> <p>If insurers get to choose their customers individually, as they would under McCain's plan, then they can either refuse coverage or set exorbitant premiums for anyone with a serious health condition. In other words, McCain's system of individual insurance is just great for anyone who doesn't really need insurance.</p> <p>Anyhow, if the McCain-Palin ticket hadn't dragged this campaign into the gutter, then we would be having a serious debate right now over their plans to eliminate employer-provided healthcare. We would also have a debate over their plans for Medicare and social security. We might hear more about their budget plans, including their intention to <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/24/AR2008042403456.html\">extend President Bush's tax cuts</a> to the richest people in the country.</p> <p>But the McCain-Palin positions on these issues are not popular. If the public clearly understood what they are proposing, they would lose in a landslide. </p> <p>Therefore, they are running a cesspool campaign to distract the public.</p>",

FIND OUT WHAT IT MEANS TO E-B-J-T!</strong></p> <p>As the Fiver gazed absentmindedly out the window, wondering what to pontificate on this afternoon, we were surprised to see our City boy cousin, Rolled-Up \u00a350 Note Braces Buy Sell Buy Sell Convertible Private Jet to Paris Tig Extension Fiver whizz past, pausing mid-plummet to point forlornly at the AIG logo on his replica shirt before exploding in a mess on Big Road below.

It's a sad state of affairs, but never mind, there's always England's Brave John Terry.</p> <p>A month ago, EBJT threw his weight behind a campaign for footballers to show more respect to referees, saying: \"Last year, was there or wasn't there a rule where you couldn't surround the referee? I couldn't tell you. Now there's a rule. You can't. It's the captain who has that responsibility to go and speak to the referee.\" And go and speak to the referee he duly did, at great length along with several of his team-mates, when Mark Halsey had the audacity to show him a red card for throwing his weight behind Jo when the Manchester City striker was sort of not really clean through on goal with only Petr Cech to beat.</p> <p>\"Chelsea have submitted a claim for wrongful dismissal on behalf of [EBJT],\" declared a statement on the FA's website this afternoon. \"[EBJT] was sent off for serious foul play during Chelsea's game against Manchester City on September 13. A regulatory commission will consider the claim on September 16.\" Chelsea's appeal is likely to fall on deaf ears because their defence is weaker than AIG's share price.

Think of the quixotic brilliance of Kevin Keegan's first reign! Or the - gasp! - back-to-back Texaco Cups in the 1970s! Best of all, think of the immortal <em>joie de vivre</em> that surrounds the club and was best embodied by former striker Hughie Gallacher who, by the admission of former coach Andy McCombie, \"used to get canned up on a Friday night\" and who, during the club's European tour of 1929, prompted an awe-struck ref to tell reporters: \"I'm convinced he was quite tipsy ... I heard he drank much cognac between the halves.\" Verily, Mike Ashley, that outed swiller of non-alcoholic ale, is an unworthy owner of this great institution!</p> <p>Good thing, then, that in the wake of the ballyhoo over Keegan's second resignation from the club, Ashley has put the Barcodes up for sale. What's more, in a statement released last night he recited even more reasons why you might like to fork out damn near \u00a3400m for the privilege of employing Joey Barton. \"The club is still in debt,\" blubbed Ashley. \"Even worse than that, the club still owes millions of pounds in transfer fees,\" he continued before brandishing a handful of magic beans and adding: \"Newcastle has the fifth highest wage bill in the Premier League.\"</p> <p>And to cap it all off, Ashley hurrahed: \"I bought Newcastle in May 2007. Newcastle attracted me because everyone in England knows that it has the best fans in football.\" Perhaps he's hoping, dear potential investor, that you read his statement with the same lack of diligence he showed when buying the club in the first place, and therefore that you missed the bit where he sobbed: \"I have really loved taking my kids to the games, being next to them and all the fans.

  "<p>As it reels from what the former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan described as a \"probably once-in-a-century type of event\", Wall Street may well be ruing the day when banking authorities acceded to its demands for wholesale deregulation of the banking sector.</p> <p>New regulation of the US financial sector seems likely once the dust settles on the financial turmoil that has seen Lehman Brothers, America's fourth-biggest investment bank, go to the wall, and the once mighty Merrill Lynch being rescued by the Bank of America.</p> <p>The Republican presidential candidate, John McCain, has already said that the crisis sweeping Lehman Brothers and other financial firms is a sign that banking regulations need an overhaul. Should that come to pass, it will mean turning back the clock.</p> <p>Beginning in the 1980s or earlier, the US banking sector lobbied Washington to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act, a statute that had been on the books since the 1930s. Glass-Steagall was part of a package of banking reforms put in place by president Franklin D Roosevelt to restore trust in the banking system.</p> <p>After the Great Crash of 1929, Wall Street was vilified for misleading the masses. Congress introduced legislation that diluted the power of big financial institutions, splitting up commercial and investment banking into separate functions. According to the act, commercial banks were not allowed to use depositors' money to finance profit-making investments other than loans.</p> <p>But the US banking sector argued that Glass-Steagall was hampering its ability to compete with rivals in Europe and Asia, which were increasing in size through a series of mergers. US banks put pressure on Congress to deregulate so they could use complex financial instruments that held out the promise of higher financial rewards.</p> <p>The other argument for deregulation was that customers would be able to buy financial products from one company. This one-stop shop, the banks argued, would allow them to make more money by cross-selling their products to customers. While banking lobbyists piled on the pressure in the corridors of Congress, the US banking sector created facts on the ground.</p> <p>When Citibank completed its merger with Travelers in October 1998, the deal drove a coach and horses through Glass-Steagall. One year later, banking's equivalent of the Wall of Jericho came crashing down. In 1999, Glass-Steagall was repealed, together with the bank holding company, a mechanism that was introduced in 1956 and provided the basis for modern US banking.</p> <p>Glass-Steagall was replaced under the Clinton administration by the Gramm-Leach Financial Modernisation Act. This blurred the lines between the commercial banks that made their money through loans, and the more risky ventures of investment banks. The new bill ended the rules that limited the ability of banks to underwrite securities, which prevented them from engaging in new lines of business such as insurance.</p> <p>As Robert Kuttner, an economics expert, <a href=\"http://www.electionnews2008.com/glass-steagall-repeal-caused-subprime-disaster.htm\">testified before Congress</a> last year: </p> <p>\"Since repeal of Glass Steagall in 1999, after more than a decade of de facto inroads, super-banks have been able to re-enact the same kinds of structural conflicts of interest that were endemic in the 1920s \u2014 lending to speculators, packaging and securitising credits and then selling them off, wholesale or retail, and extracting fees at every step along the way. And much of this paper is even more opaque to bank examiners than its counterparts were in the 1920s.\"</p> <p>The repeal of Glass-Steagall coincided with low interest rates that put pressure on financial institutions to seek higher returns through more arcane financial instruments. Wall Street investment banks, with their appetite for risk, led the charge. </p> <p>Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers became heavily involved in property, underwriting billions in mortgage-backed securities and investing in commercial property. Bear Stearns had the fortune to be rescued by JP Morgan from its ill-fated foray into the sub-prime market. </p> <p>Not so Lehman. In the UK, Northern Rock came a cropper by borrowing money to fund its loans and mortgages. When borrowing dried up because of the credit crunch, the Rock had to be bailed out by the Bank of England.</p> <p>US banks \u2014 particularly investment banks \u2014 are in difficulty because they were granted what they wished for. Left to their own devices, several have managed to ruin themselves and create havoc in the international financial system. Wall Street bankers may be wishing that regulators had kept them on a tighter leash, not least because fewer of them would be out of a job today.</p>",
  "<p>As the Republicans edge ahead in the US Presidential election, Barack Obama's people have tried to puncture their balloon using one line of attack more than most. For all John McCain and Sarah Palin's repeated claims that \"Washington isn't working\", doesn't the fact that their party has been in control \u2013 of both the presidency and Congress \u2013 for most of the last eight years rather undermine their credibility? Ergo the charge that they're \"<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/04/opinion/04thu1.html?incamp=article_popular\">running against themselves</a>\", a buzz-phrase whose potency is highlighted when you Google it: at the last count, it brought up just over a million and a half results.</p> <p>The same words came to mind when I heard about the ringleaders of the current ragtag anti-Brown revolt. Siobhain McDonagh boasts of never having voted against the government; as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/15/gordonbrown.labour\">Mark Seddon</a> points out elsewhere on Cif, Joan Ryan has long been in the habit of \"ritually denouncing\" anyone who wants to question the New Labour script. The fact that some of them have put in spells as junior ministers might conceivably be raised in their defence, but nonetheless, a quick visit to <a href=\"http://www.theyworkforyou.com/\">Theyworkforyou.com</a> fleshes out the profiles of such sudden insurrectionists as George Howarth, Greg Pope, Janet Anderson, Jim Dowd and Barry Gardiner: all of them voted for the introduction of ID cards, foundation hospitals, top-up fees, the replacement of Trident and the Iraq war. The fact that they've been joined by looser cannons such as as Graham Stringer, Gordon Prentice and that hard-left desperado John McDonnell (who has surely managed his own version of the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact) doesn't alter the revolt's fundamentals: politically, its prime movers are stuck on exactly the same page as the PM they want to topple.</p> <p>In that context, their explanation for their volte-face are inevitably rather contorted. As far as I'm aware, McDonagh and Ryan \u2013 by far the most visible plotters, to date at least \u2013 have gone on endlessly about the need for a change of \"direction\", without even beginning to detail what that actually mean. Howarth has a go in this morning's <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/george-howarth-why-we-need-a-leadership-contest-930879.html\">Independent</a>, and it is not pretty: \"We must take control and confront the problems that now face us,\" he says, daringly. \"We have to explain what sort of country we want Britain to be in a way that resonates with the public. We need a story that tells how our progressive principles translate into policies that help ordinary people.\" The rest passes in a haze of grey New Labourspeak: by way of a vision, he offers not much more than a picture of \"individuals, families and society working together to be the best we can be\".</p> <p>His most priceless line, however, is the claim that Labour has to act fast to \"rebuild the support we have lost over the last year\". Not that one wants to sound too withering, but really: between the elections of 1997 and 2005 \u2013 that is, prior to the last 12 months \u2013 Labour lost no less than 4.5 million voters. The fact that neither its core support nor millions of floating voters seem to have much of a clue about what Labour now stands for is a malaise that took root long ago, when Blair was merrily trashing Labour orthodoxy and most of the rebels were dutifully applauding. Brown's problems have been twofold: a chronically dysfunctional approach to administration and PR, for sure, but also his refusal to consider the kind of social-democratic moves that the times demand (on this score, needless to say, his refusal to go near a windfall tax on the energy companies speaks volumes), and use rhetoric more convincing than the washed-out stuff of New Labourism. One thinks of a comment from a voter heard during the Crewe and Nantwich byelection: \"We thought he'd be different from Blair, and he's exactly the same.\"</p> <p>The only revolt worth taking seriously \u2013 and one that, needless to say, has yet to materialise \u2013 would be one built on an intelligent understanding of the essentials of Labour's current predicament: the fact that, as such well-known lefties as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/14/marketturmoil.economics\">Will Hutton</a> have lately been pointing out, the terms of politics and economics are changing at speed, and articles of faith minted in the mid-1990s will no longer do the business. The September plotters \u2013 and, indeed, the outer ring of anti-Brownites whose nebulous critique is <a href=\"http://www.progressives.org.uk/Magazine/article.asp?a=3351\">here</a> \u2013 apparently have nothing to offer beyond more of the same. It's true: to all intents and purposes, they are running against themselves.</p>",
  "<p>A media \"backlash\" against ABC news interviewer Charlie Gibson in the wake of his series of question and answer sessions with Republican VP candidate Sarah Palin has largely failed to develop, save reflexive criticism from conservative columnists who leapt to insulate Palin from questions about her competence.</p> <p>Charles Krauthammer <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/12/AR2008091202457_pf.html\">wrote</a> in the Washington Post Saturday that Gibson's query about Palin's views on the \"Bush Doctrine\" was misleading because no consensus exists about what the \"Bush Doctrine\" is. He wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p>Yes, Sarah Palin didn't know what it is. But neither does Charlie Gibson. And at least she didn't pretend to know -- while he looked down his nose and over his glasses with weary disdain, sighing and \"sounding like an impatient teacher,\" as the Times noted. In doing so, he captured perfectly the establishment snobbery and intellectual condescension that has characterized the chattering classes' reaction to the mother of five who presumes to play on their stage.</p> </blockquote> <p>This morning, William Kristol in the New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/15/opinion/15kristol.html?_r=1&amp;ref=opinion&amp;oref=slogin\">wrote</a> of the media reaction to the Palin pick:</p> <blockquote> <p>The media establishment was horrified. Its members expressed their disapproval. Palin became more popular. They got even more frustrated. And so we had the spectacle last week of ABC's Charlie Gibson, one of the most civil of the media bigwigs, unable to help himself from condescending to Palin as if he were a senior professor forced to waste time administering a Ph.D. exam to a particularly unpromising graduate student.</p> </blockquote> <p>I have to disagree with Kristol's assertion that the \"media establishment was horrified\" and \"expressed their disapproval\". The media establishment was surprised at the unconventional pick, not horrified. And it was not \"disapproval\" that the establishment expressed, but puzzlement about the wisdom of the pick, doubt about Palin's credentials, and appropriate cynicism about the motivation for the pick. These are appropriate reactions.</p> <p>Both pundits' use of the term 'condescending' catches my eye. Is that an acknowledgement that on some level Palin is not on the same level, in terms of experience and knowledge, as Gibson? I cannot imagine someone using that term to criticise a media figure's interaction with Obama, McCain or Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>But most of all, Gibson's tone or even the substance of his questions is irrelevant. </p> <p>Whatever can be said about Gibson's performance, it has nothing to do with whether Sarah Palin has enough experience to serve as vice-president and if need be president, whether she and McCain obscure her long support for congressional earmarks and the \"bridge to nowhere\", whether she has a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/13/AR2008091302596.html\">management style </a>we want in a president, why as mayor, her <a href=\"http://www.adn.com/news/alaska/story/523708.html\">police department made rape victims pay for the rape exam</a>, and other questions.</p> <p>There is room for legitimate media self-critique, but that's not what Kristol and Krauthammer are doing. Kristol doesn't explore what he describes as Gibson's flaw and offers no remedy. Krauthammer's piece is concerned with defending against criticism she is so unaware of foreign affairs she didn't know that \"Bush Doctrine\" refers to Bush's strategy of preemptive war against states believed to post a potential threat to US interests.</p> <p>In charging Gibson with condescension, these two decidedly elite, establishment pundits distract their readers from more pressing questions about Palin's fitness for the job.</p>",
  "<p>Last Tuesday, US Democratic House speaker Nancy Pelosi arrived 45 minutes late to a press conference that she had called. She finally showed up to talk about energy issues. Her party will allow a vote on legislation that would allow <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/oilRpt/idUKN1019497620080911\">limited offshore oil exploration</a>. Of course, that bill will be larded with so many tax hikes and other provisions that Republicans (and some Democrats) find objectionable that it will go down to defeat by vote or by the president's veto pen.</p> <p>The only reason that Democrats, who control both houses of Congress, are even holding the vote is that they are spooked. In August, House Republicans protested that the majority party wouldn't hold a vote on allowing more energy exploration. Democrats responded by turning the House lights off on them. Yes, <a href=\"http://www.reason.com/blog/show/127930.html\">Reason magazine's David Weigel</a> wrote, \"this actually happened\".</p> <p>Voters tell pollsters that the issue is of great importance to them, and so Democratic presidential contender Barack Obama <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/01/AR2008080103199.html\">flipped</a> on the issue, though without much enthusiasm. At his <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2008/08/obama_we_are_a.html\">big speech at the Democratic convention</a>, he thought it necessary to explain that this was \"a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution\" to supplement his otherwise minty green approach to energy.</p> <p>Dems had thought that the issue could be dealt with easily, but they underestimated Republican enthusiasm. Most elected Democrats didn't want more exploration. Perhaps they were willing to grudgingly allow some \"stop-gap measure\" to go forward, but that was it. Then they encountered the Republican throngs chanting <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/15/opinion/15hahn.html\">\"Drill baby, drill!\"</a> What do they do now?</p> <p>They're not just discombobulated over drilling. Coming out of Denver, Democrats thought they had this election locked up. After all, serious gains in Congress were all but assured. Obama's much-lauded speech had been the <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2008/08/30/politics/horserace/entry4400853.shtml\">most-watched acceptance address of all time</a>, and it took place in a packed sports stadium with Greek columns in the backdrop. Democrats had a young, audacious candidate and were facing a party whose standard-bearer was crusty senior senator who was, by his own admission, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/POLITICS/blogs/politicalticker/2006/12/mccain-im-older-than-dirt.html\">\"older than dirt\"</a>.</p> <p>A week later, John McCain's speech was more watched than Obama's, and the post-convention polls gave the GOP a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigger\">Tigger</a>-sized bounce. Much attention has been paid to McCain's pick of Alaska governor Sarah Palin as his running mate, and there's no doubt that mattered a great deal. The relentless criticism of her before her speech and her combative response instantly turned her into a mix of right-wing darling and redneck folk hero.</p> <p>But Palin and drilling only part of a larger pattern of things that have gone right for the GOP lately. New York congressman and House ways and means committee chairman Charlie Rangel faces possible charges of tax evasion. President Bush announced a small drawdown of troops from Iraq. Rather than cheering this, Obama complained that the US government isn't putting more troops in Afghanistan, muddying his anti-war appeal at a time when he needs all the votes he can get. A new <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/110263/Battle-Congress-Suddenly-Looks-Competitive.aspx\">Gallup daily tracking poll</a> even found, implausibly, that Democratic control of Congress is starting to look doubtful.</p> <p>What's happening? Some political parties are good at cutting the governing party down to size in opposition, and modern Republicans are masters of this. They lost their narrow hold on Congress in the 2006 midterm elections, and they no longer feel it necessary to defend much of Bush's legacy.</p> <p>Even the war in Iraq is being spun as something that's nearly over. Palin praised US forces in Iraq \"who have now brought victory within sight\". That may not be strictly true in Iraq, but it's a pretty good description of McCain's long march on the White House.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>2.50 PM:</strong> Delegates are already squaring up for a fight over Nick Clegg's <a href=\"http://www.libdems.org.uk/assets/0000/7745/Make_it_Happen.pdf\">Make it Happen (pdf) </a> document. </p> <p>Not everyone is happy that one of the flagship proposals is tax cuts for low and middle income earners, and an amendment due to be tabled as part of a debate this afternoon will explain why. </p> <p>Other proposals include cracking down on tax avoidance by the super-rich, cutting waste, and introducing local elected boards to run local NHS services. </p> <p>A one-and-a-half hour debate on the contents of Clegg's six page booklet will end in a vote either way. If, as is expected, delegates back the controversial proposals it will formally become party policy.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>3.05 PM:</strong> Danny Alexander opens the debate. This debate is about how you apply the unchanging liberal values of fairness to today. It is social liberalism for the 21st century, he says in reference to the document in question, Make it Happen.</p> <p>Those on low and average income are hurting badly. He talks of a constituent in tears because her energy bills have doubled and she is struggling to make ends meet. The 62-year-old is being forced to choose between heating and eating. That's not freedom, and it's not fair, he says to polite applause.</p> <p>We're the only party with a plan to set the party on the right track, he says. It is a vision we can get across on every door step in this country.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>3.05 PM:</strong> He highlights the eye-catching elements of the document and concludes that <br>the Liberal Democrats have a \"compelling agenda\" to present to the people in Britain.</p> <p>Referring to the tax cut plans, he highlights their redistributive merits. \"The most redestributive package for a generation,\" he says. No applause there, as you might have expected.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>3.05 PM:</strong> He highlights policy commitments on housing and disadvantaged kids in education.</p> <p>He then deals with the thorny issue of a dissenting amendments, which call for tax cuts to be a secondary concern, not a primary one. But Alexander says the tax cuts are \"crucial\" to tackling inequality. Applaud comes at last. </p> <p>I would rather hand money back to struggling families than to central government. \"That is the choice you have before you today.\" More applause. An encouraging sign for Nick Clegg.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>3.10 PM:</strong> Alexander says if Vince Cable backs tax cuts and thinks there are so many billions to be clawed back from closing loopholes on the super-rich, it must be so. More applause when the party favourite is mentioned.</p> <p>Alexander is still working the audience to reject that amendment. \"Give us the platform to deliver real change across Britain at the next election.\" applause.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>3.15 PM:</strong> Exit Alexander, on comes Paul Holmes, from Chesterfield, who is moving the amendment.</p> <p>He tells delegates that those behind the amendment are behind 99% of the document, but they do reject that one little element on the tax cuts. He says no one is suggesting throwing the money into the morgue of central government diktat. </p> <p>But what about public services, for example? The Lib Dems have fought in the past for more spending on public services. We are now being told that the best way is to give low and middle income earners some money back on top of a 6p cut rate of tax. </p> <p>He says the extra money would be equivalent to another 1p - thereabouts. Ask someone if they want a tax cut and you get a predictable response. But he points to the elderly care service needs, and the fact there isn't enough money there. </p> <p>He then points to tuition fees, and the fact that the money isn't there to ensure the fees are scrapped. In sum, public service commitments should supersede Clegg's tax cut proposals. There is louder applause for his argument than there was for Alexander's pitch - and a few cheers to boot.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>3.20 PM:</strong> Michael German, the leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, has just come on to back the motion endorsing the document. </p> <p>He talks about communities in his backyard, who face some real issues, such as lower life expectancy and so on - some of the poorest people in Britain, who shop in Aldi, not in Waitrose. These people have to make tough choices, because they are already shopping at the bottom of the market, he says.</p> <p>The Lib Dems as a party have to make tough choices and change as a party too. He counters Holmes' earlier point by saying throwing more money at public services doesn't necessarily create better public services. What is better is to put more power in the hands of people so they can shape and define the services for their local community and themselves.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>3.25 PM:</strong> Richard Grayson, from Hemel Hempstead, comes on next. He defends the amendment, which, he says, doesn't say don't have tax cuts, but simply says don't make it such a high priority.</p> <p>The idea that people will be more powerful with a few more pounds in their pockets doesn't necessarily stack up. He argues instead for high spending in public services to achieve say, smaller class sizes in state schools, to match those in private education.</p> <p>\"Money can be better spent in better ways than by introducing tax cuts.\"</p> <p>Those extra savings Clegg has identified from such measures as scrapping ID cards could be used for \"bold\" measures elsewhere, such as extra policing.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>3.25 PM:</strong> We've already got a good policy on fair tax cuts, we don't need another one, he says. He gets a good reception as he leaves the stage.</p> <p>I've looked up properly for the first time, and it's quite clear that we're quite a few short of the 6,000 delegates that are reported to have registered for this conference.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>3.25 PM:</strong> Graham Watson, MEP and leader of the Lib Dem European party, is next. </p> <p>He's provoking a bit of reaction from the audience as he lays out his argument in favour of Clegg's document and against the amendment. Food prices are up by over a tenth, petrol prices by over a fifth. Then there are rising repossessions ... all these things have convinced him of the case for tax cuts, just as it would have convinced Liberal leaders of old, just has it has convinced the incumbent Nick Clegg. He's getting quite a lot of applause as he calls for the motion to be supported, unamended.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>3.30 PM:</strong> A senior citizen called Roger Roberts comes on to say that nothing would be lost if the amendment were carried. \"Surely our priority immediately - first of all - should be to remove that inequality\" that Mike German was talking about earlier, he says passionately.</p> <p>He says he can agree a 100% on what the document says, just not how a bit of it is framed (that emphasis on the tax cut).</p> <p>\"Nobody loses face, nobody loses anything at all, by passing that amendment.\" </p> <p>He's made a fine and passionate speech, and gets a decent round of applause he exits right off stage.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>3.35 PM:</strong> Like Rogers, Tom McNally sits in the house of Lords. In fact, he's the Lib Dem leader in the Lords. He comes on next to praise the great traditions of the party, and their relevance in the 21st century. He is speaking against the amendment.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>3.40 PM:</strong> He says it's no good giving Vince Cable a standing ovation before lunch (as delegates did this morning when he focused on the proposed tax cuts as part of his speech) and then pulling the chair away (or was it his legs?) in the afternoon by voting against that very proposal.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>3.45 PM:</strong> The mood in the conference hall suggests Clegg's proposal are going to be carried in full, and the amendment - which seeks to dampen the tax cut pledge into a lower priority - will be lost. By how many votes remains to be seen. </p> <p>Elaine Bagshaw, from Liberal Youth, comes on stage to announce she's only 22, has masses of student debt, and is one of those people failed by the Labour government. Applause.</p> <p>While everyone seems absorbed with the impact of the credit crunch on the housing market, young people like herself are so far away from the first rung of the housing ladder it isn't relevant to her and her peers. </p> <p>She wholeheartedly backs Clegg's proposals, arguing that under the plans, you won't have to choose between better public services and tax cuts. You can have both, she says. </p> <p>Public spending should not be a black hole though. If the Lib Dems cut waste and unnecessary bureaucracy, there'll be the extra cash to hand out. You don't <em>have</em> to create yet more policies to spend the money centrally.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>3.55 PM:</strong> We're now at a stage called the \"intervention session\", which lasts around 10 minutes. </p> <p>We're going to get a number of interventions from the audience. Jeremy Hargreaves, from Croydon, is speaking rather quickly to get all his points across in 60 seconds. In summary, he supports the motion (ie that document).</p> <p>Tony Hill, from Maidenhead, does too. Arnie Gibbons says if the Lib Dems go to the general election on a tax-cutting ticket, it will give the impression that they are the party of empty promises because they won't be able to fund their policy commitments in full. He at least, wants that amendment carried.</p> <p>Jo Swinson, MP for East Dunbartonshire, is next. She says the Lib Dems should be bold enough to go for the tax cut option. A few cheers are offered at this point.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>4.00 PM:</strong> Nigel Quintin, a prospective parliamentary candidate supports the amendment. Tax cuts are a tool, not a panacea in the face of rising household bills. The amendment is merely a clarification of Liberal Democrat values, he says.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>4.05 PM:</strong> The interventions are finished, and we're now back to people walking on and off stage. Duncan Brack, from Streatham, and chair of the federal conference committee, says reducing the overall tax burden is important but there isn't a lot of detail to back it up. Whatever you think of the idea, this is not the way to form policy he says, to quite loud applause. </p> <p>He refers to the press suggestions that Nick Clegg is positioning his party to the right, or alongside, the Tories. This is clearly not something to be proud of. He harks back to Lloyd George and his views that there are things that only the state can handle. Back to the present day, and the need to use public investment to fund say, green investment, which is of paramount importance in the modern day. </p> <p>He urges delegates to vote for the amendment and put conference back in the driving seat of forming party policy. As an aside, there is a clear sense that the tax cut proposals are an uncomfortable departure from the Liberal Democrat comfort zone.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>4.10 PM:</strong> The darling of conference, Vince Cable, comes on next to fight his corner. As he does, Nick Clegg and Ed Davey walk past to sit down in the front row, almost bang opposite the podium.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>4.15 PM:</strong> Richard Younger Ross, an MP from Cambridge, comes on. He says he's never had someone coming to his constituency surgeries to ask him to cut tax burdens. What they'll come in to talk about is their needs, such as swifter NHS treatment, for example. </p> <p>He's arguing for the amendment and against claims that if passed, it would be \"tying Vince's hands\". It won't, he says. He asks whether care for the elderly is a lower priority than tax cuts. Is cutting tuition fees a lower priority than tax cuts, he asks rhetorically. Unfortunately, a few in the audience respond by saying \"yes\".</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>4.15 PM:</strong> Tim Farron, MP for Westmoreland and Lonsdale who was also the warm-up act at the Saturday evening rally, tries to contrast Tory tax cuts (always about the rich) with theirs (relieving people from poverty). </p> <p>He says the amendment would put policy in a \"straitjacket\". He says its more liberal to say the party won't be wasting money. He takes umbrage at the suggestion that the money from tax cuts should be spent on axing tuition fees. </p> <p>He thinks it isn't a case of either/or here. He is committed to both policies, and confesses that he finds it odd not to be part of the awkward squad on this issue as he urges delegates to vote for the motion and against the amendment.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>4.20 PM:</strong> Heavyweight Chris Huhne, MP for Eastleigh and Lib Dem home affairs spokesman, reminds delegates the Liberal Democrats backed the public service commission in 2002. </p> <p>Six years on, the country has seen a real growth in public spending - on education, on health and so on. </p> <p>Now families are feeling the pinch with rising energy bills, do we ignore their plight. \"Is it socially just not to give them some help?\"</p> <p>He refers to changing one's mind when the facts change. He rebuts suggestions that the tax cut measure would be a shift to the right. \"It's not a shift to the right to make our taxes fairer.\" As you would expect, he backs Clegg's motion \"unamended\".</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>4.30 PM:</strong> We're getting close to the finishing line (votes). Dr Evan Harris, MP for Oxford West and Abingdon, come to the stage to sum up in support of the amendment. </p> <p>He makes a good joke which makes everyone laugh, and I'm sorry to say I missed it. The humour circles around the fact that he's realised the amendment is unlikely to be carried by some margin. </p> <p>He rejects the idea that passing the amendment would be a kick in the teeth for Clegg or that it would tie up Cable's hands. </p> <p>Voting for the amendment would not send our leader \"back to stud\". I thought our campaign message was a popular principled one of taxing more fairly and spending more fairly, he says. </p> <p>He's worried about inconsistent comments attributed to Nick Clegg in the press - in some he seems to have pledged more of the \u00a320bn to tax cuts than he has to others, where he has framed it as redistribution of money \"left over\". </p> <p>The amendment is all about the emphasis placed on tax cuts , but Harris knows as he goes to sit down that delegates are probably going to opt for backing Clegg's vision 100%, without nuance or doubt about its priority as a policy.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>4.35 PM:</strong> And so to Simon Hughes, MP for Bermondsey and outgoing party president, who makes the closing speech in support of the main motion. He takes on the concerns aired over the past hour and 40-odd minutes. </p> <p>On the point that tax cuts should not be at the expense of tackling inequality, tax cuts for those at the bottom who do pay taxes ARE a way of tackling inequality. Applause.</p> <p>He qualifies the amount of money saved that would be redistributed through tax. Delegates would have a say nearer the time, but it's impossible to talk figures at this early point.</p> <p>the Lib Dems are not the party of empty promises either. Policies are changing because times have changes. He refers to someone who called him at 5.55am who has developed mental illness, brought on by the stress of credit card debt. </p> <p>On to Lib Dem principles. The party must be ready to adapt and change to be relevant in the modern day. If you are very rich, you will pay more. If you are very poor, you will pay less. </p> <p>That is the liberal and distinctive message. This will persuade voters we are on their side. Applause. And now we come to the vote.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>4.40 PM:</strong> The amendment calling for tax cuts to be a second order issue is defeated by a large majority.</p> <p>The motion supporting Clegg's policy document for the party is overwhelmingly carried.</p>",
  "<p>We awake on the east coast today to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/15/business/15lehman.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin\">find </a>some of America's major investment houses either being bought or collapsing. </p> <p>I'm not an economist and won't pretend to be, but it's pretty clear in the immediate term, i.e. over the weekend, the Fed's decision not to bail out Lehman left big traders shorting it like crazy. We'll see how the markets react today, but this is as big a piece of financial news as this country has seen in a long time. Merrill Lynch employs 60,000 people, as well as handling the investments of small investors all over America in storefront offices in those small towns the Republicans love so much.</p> <p>What's John McCain's record on all this? First of all, not much, since he admits that he doesn't understand the economy. Second of all, deregulate -- in other words, get government snoopers out of the picture, which only lets the swindlers hide their losses for a while, until the truth becomes too plain and we the taxpayers foot the bill.</p> <p>Now that I think of it, that sounds kinda familiar. I've been wondering if <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keating_Five\">the Keating scandal</a> would ever appear during this campaign. Now it seems to me the Obama camp has good reason to introduce it.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a McCain economic advisor, Donald Luskin, took to the pages of the Wash Post just yesterday <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/12/AR2008091202415.html\">to write</a>: \"Things today just aren't that bad.\" And more. Bravo.</p> <p>If all this isn't tailor-made for a series of tough ads, it's hard to imagine what is. Republicans may not be able to prosecute war or protect a city from floods or help working-class people keep good jobs with health care, but at least they were always the party that helped people look after their money. But now they can't even do <em>that</em>, unless you're McCain's idea of rich and make $5 million a year.</p> <p>Ah yes, but can the carping critics field dress a moose? Because we all know that's far more important.<br></p>",
  "<p>At first I identified with <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-ig-notebook7-2008sep07,0,7585060.story\">Sarah Palin's jaunty style</a> - open-toed slides in the office; handsome eye wear. \"I want an Alaska crab centerpiece for <em>my</em> glass table!\" As a carnivore, I've no problem with a woman hunting or lounging on bear skin. Also, I find the mooseburger jokes childish. Like a lot of New York foodies, I'm game for any dish I haven't tried. Like many a female voter, I'm attracted to a candidate I can \"relate\" to. <br> There's only one problem. What if she ... puts ketchup on that mooseburger? </p> <p>Recently, at the Republican convention in St Paul, Palin did the political equivalent. I was struck by her <a href=\"http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2008/09/palin_and_special_needs_children.php\">abrasive manner</a> - and the double standards that came into play. Were she from the left, she'd be labeled a feminazi. A lipsticked \"pit bull\"? This is the kind of talk that sends American men running off to Thailand, seeking a vacation from feminism. They're <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2200015/\">chasing a fantasy</a>, as any professional exotic could tell you, but escapism becomes a necessity when women envision themselves as attack dogs in mixed company. </p> <p>Let's dispel a few stereotypes. \"Feminist\" has <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/aw/content_display/news/agency/e3id9a975e26c8545c5e71053a292fdb2c6\">become a brand</a>, a superficial way of labeling the GOP's vice-presidential pick, who is currently being marketed like soap. </p> <p>Populist feminism perceives women as some sort of \"team,\" claiming to do something for women without bothering to analyse our situation - and never mind if it's an inconsistent, incomplete definition of \"women.\" </p> <p><a href=\"http://foxforum.blogs.foxnews.com/2008/09/11/jpinkerton_0912/\">Hockey feminism</a>, as I see it, doesn't care about the complexity of female existence. Women's lives are shaped by many factors, such as income, education, race, citizenship status, the wealth or poverty of a nation, and how we earn a living. Hockey feminism ignores all that. \"Sexist\" becomes a convenient accusation because it's just a competing brand.</p> <p>It's hard to resist the inevitable: comparing Sarah Palin with Hillary Clinton. I'm not one of Hillary's particular fans. I tolerated her when Bill was president and grew to accept her, but Sarah Palin's sudden appearance on the scene helps me to understand the cult of Hillary. Palin's popularity seems driven by her useful qualities, her immediacy. When the going gets tough within Palin's own party, will she be able to inspire divisive rage? Fanatic loyalty? I doubt it.</p> <p>Hillary is deeply interested in what's useful to<em>her</em>, and that's why she's admired: she is nobody's puppet. And the loyalty she commands was built over years, on and off centre-stage, not a few spectacular weeks in the glare of a presidential election. It's misguided to set up an invidious comparison between Hillary and Palin, as some have done, suggesting that Palin worked her way up into power and status, while Hillary did it \"the easy way\" through marriage and connections. </p> <p>Learning how to work your connections is harder than it looks, and marriage isn't necessarily the easiest one to work. Combine it with personal ambition, and you're looking at a very complex recipe. Nobody can take for granted that a marriage will last or that a spouse will live up to the original deal. Marriage is a form of intimate diplomacy. Between managing a 30-year partnership with Bill Clinton and managing a small town, it would be rash to say which is the more challenging endeavour.</p> <p>It's not that small town politics can be dismissed as light work, only that a Clinton-style marriage is a high-wire enterprise. Hillary didn't marry a low-achieving male (as some accomplished women choose to do), nor did she settle for taming an equal. Instead, she married a man whose extravagant ego outweighs her own, ample as it is. Despite her wardrobe and her boomer feminism, a potentially awkward income disparity (now resolved) and her low birth rate (especially by Palin standards), there is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/feb/12/whospimpingwho\">something unexpectedly feminine</a> - and therefore complicated - about Hillary's approach to marriage.</p> <p>Ironically enough, hockey feminism is roughly modeled on a Marxist idea - even when it gets trotted out by the political right - but it's an idea that doesn't hold up because it pretends we constitute a single class. Even when a country's written laws restrict a woman's freedom, women from different strata of a society are affected in different ways. Take, for example, laws that criminalise abortion, prostitution or driving a car. A woman's income or social status can soften the impact, allowing her to travel for an abortion, sell sex behind closed doors, or be driven about in a nice car.</p> <p>All <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2008/09/11/zombie_feminism/\">women sharing a common interest</a> is a political fiction, but an earlier generation of privileged women cut its teeth on the popular slogan \"Sisterhood Is Powerful\". We've also been told that sisterhood is global, when sisterhood - in reality - is profoundly balkanised. </p> <p>How many Hillary supporters are drawn to McCain because of Palin's hockey feminism? Sisterhood is a powerful myth, easily exploited by party hacks preying on our emotions while betting on our bigotry.</p>",

As we've reported earlier, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/sep/15/liberaldemocrats.libdemconference\"> some Lib Dem activists have been warning today about the prospect of the party losing seats to the Tories at the next election.</a> We'll hear what the panel think.</p> <p>Simon Hoggart, who is chairing, opens the meeting and invites Curtice to start.</p> <p>Curtice says he'll tell us how the election could be an opportunity, and how it could be a threat. How very even-handed. (That's academics for you.) He'll conclude it's a gamble, he says.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>1.15 PM:</strong> There are now almost as many seats where the Lib Dems are close behind Labour as there are where they are close behind the Tories, he says. So in theory Labour's unpopularity should present an opportunity.</p> <p>Curtice says he's always thought the Lib Dems best chance of getting \"leverage\" in British politics lies in a hung parliament. But the Lib Dems needs to sort out what they would do. He points out that the Lib Dems' failure to strike a coalition deal after the last Welsh assembly election gave Rhodri Morgan the chance to regroup.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>1.15 PM:</strong> As for threats, Curtice says for every two people switching from Labour to the Lib Dems, there are three switching from Labour to the Tories.</p> <p>What's really happening, Curtice suggests, is that the Lib Dems are taking a gamble. He says he's referring to the way Nick Clegg has repositioned the party as one that would cut the overall burden of tax, not increase it. This seems to be in tune with popular opinion. But changing policy on its own is not enough; you have to be able to sell it.</p> <p>Will the public believe the party has really changed, he asks?</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>1.20 PM:</strong> How many people in Bournemouth would be able to tell you that the Lib Dems are now committed to cutting income tax by 4p (or the equivalent) for low earners? Good question. (Hardly any is the answer, I expect.)</p> <p>The other potential problem is that the policy could make it harder for the party to attract support from ex-Labour voters.</p> <p>Hoggart tells us that Teather isn't here because she fell ill after a trip to Nigeria.</p> <p>Huhne comes next. I've just noticed his tie - Technicolor red. Does he pinch them from Jon Snow?</p> <p>Commenting on the polls, Huhne says the Lib Dems have almost always picked up support during a general election campaign as a result of the media coverage they get. The only time this did not happen was when they had two leaders who rowed about tax during the campaign (Steel and Owen in 1987).</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>1.25 PM:</strong> The Lib Dems are also better than other parties at developing an \"incumbency factor\", he says, quoting a Nuffield study. This apparently is worth 6.6% of the vote.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>1.25 PM:</strong> And because the Lib Dems have a relatively young parliamentary party, they have proportionally fewer MPs retiring, which means they do not lose the incumbency factor in seats being contested by new candidates.</p> <p>Moving on to Labour, he says that, even with a new leader, Labour's vote is likely to fall. the Lib Dems have the potential to make very significant gains. (Not everyone in the party agrees - as I've blogged elsewhere today.)</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>1.30 PM:</strong> But Huhne wants to focus on the Tories. He says that, although they appear to be doing well, they are vulnerable, not least because their contention that they are the party of fairness is extremely dubious.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>1.30 PM:</strong> To get a majority of one, Cameron needs a swing of 6.9%. This would be bigger than any previous swing to the Tories, he says.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>1.35 PM:</strong> Huhne moves on to the tax package being debated this afternoon, which shows that the Lib Dems are the party of fairness, he says. For the first time, he's getting people coming to him in his constituency saying that they are struggling with their bills. The \"progressive\" response is to offer them support, he says.</p> <p>So the next election is an opportunity, he concludes.</p> <p>Campbell starts, taking his jacket off. \"I can say without fear of contradiction that this is not a leadership bid,\" he jokes. Funny to think he was running the show 12 months ago. As well as today's debate, he is doing one or two other fringe meetings. But he's not appearing on the conference platform.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>1.35 PM:</strong> He says he was labelled in one of the papers today as a \"centre-left politician\". \"I plead guilty,\" he says, to applause. Like Stephen Williams and Vincent Cable yesterday, he doesn't seem to have accepted the Clegg notion that the Lib Dems are neutral between Labour and the Tories.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>1.35 PM:</strong> The poor pay a higher proportion of their incomes in taxation than the rich, he says. When that is compounded by a Gordon Brown sleight of hand on taxation \"worthy of Paul Daniels\", then the case for reform is even stronger.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>1.40 PM:</strong> Campbell moves on to Europe, saying he won't resile from his belief in the benefits of the EU. More applause. (Huhne didn't get applause until the end of his speech, although I wouldn't read too much into that.) Of course, there are aspects of the EU that need to be reformed. But reform will only happen if Britain engages with the EU.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>1.40 PM:</strong> He says Cameron's inheritance tax plans show that the Tories are not committed to fairness. And Labour's record has shown it to be the most authoritarian government for the last 100 years.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>1.40 PM:</strong> Moving on to foreign policy, he derides Cameron for going to Tbilisi and urging the Georgians to join an EU that his own party dislikes. And he says Cameron described himself as a liberal conservative in a speech in Pakistan because he could not use that phrase at home.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>1.45 PM:</strong> Campbell says one of the reasons he is so keen to describe himself as a politician of the centre-left is that there is no other party on the centre-left now. It's a powerful point, which seems to blow a hole in Clegg's repositioning manoeuvres (although, to be fair, Clegg refuses to use labels like left and right himself, arguing, with some justice, that they are misleading).</p> <p>Campbell also says that he would not support any deal with another party that did not involve early legislation on electoral reform.</p> <p>We're on to questions now. After a quick dig at Europe, another questioner, in response to Huhne, says he is still waiting for the \"late surge\" promised in 1987.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>1.45 PM:</strong> Curtice says he doesn't think Europe will be an issue in the general election, although beating Ukip in the European elections next year could be \"quite a considerable task\".</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>1.50 PM:</strong> Picking up on Campbell's point about PR, Curtice says that in Wales electoral reform would have been part of the deal leading to a Tory-Plaid Cymru-Liberal Democrat coalition. But that pact fell through. He says the chances of the Tories offering PR after the election are almost zero. The Lib Dems need to decide whether they would want to trigger an early second election.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>1.55 PM:</strong> Huhne says the Lib Dems are the only party offering a referendum on EU membership.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>1.55 PM:</strong> Campbell says there were \"quite a lot of sleepless nights\" for him and Charles Kennedy when they came out against the Iraq war. (He is picking up a point about judgment made by one of the questioners.) He says he attended the Democratic convention recently. If the Democrats win, the prospects of the White House pursuing a Bush-style aggressive foreign policy would be extremely unlikely. Even if the Republicans win, American foreign policy would be different because the Americans are losing their appetite for war, he says. From here, Campbell segues into a point about the EU being more important than ever.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>2.00 PM:</strong> Another question. Someone suggests the local income tax policy will be hard to sell.</p> <p>Curtice says that Cable's speech this morning will not have gone down well with well-paid public sector workers (who will have to reapply for their jobs and take a pay cut). He warns that the party is giving out mixed messages.</p> <p>Huhne says the party's tax message is very clear.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>2.00 PM:</strong> Campbell says average household income in Britain is \u00a325,000 a year. The local income tax plan would only expect people to pay more if they are earning more than \u00a375,000 a year. There are millions of people \"in very straitened circumstances\". That's why the Lib Dem tax plans being proposed this afternoon are correct.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>The verdict:</strong> I'm not sure that we learned much more about what will happen to the Lib Dems at the next election. Huhne had some thoughtful arguments as to why the Lib Dems could do better than expected, but his comments about the prospects of winning seats off Labour and about the Tory threat not being as serious as it looks were impressionistic. He didn't support them with electoral data.</p> <p>The highlight of the meeting was Campbell's proud claim to be a centre-left politician in a country where Labour has abandoned the centre-left. He's well off-message. (Huhne is defending a seat where he is vulnerable to Tories keen to depict the Lib Dems as closet socialists.) But I guess his remarks reflect what many Lib Dem activists believe and, judging by his reception today, there seems to be a lot of residual affection for him in the party.</p>",
  "<p>Should Barack Obama have picked Hillary Clinton as his vice-presidential nominee? </p> <p>It's easy to say so now. The suggestion is that by picking Hillary, Obama would either have dulled the impact of John McCain's choice of Sarah Palin, or made it less likely that he would have picked her at all. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/14/uselections2008.sarahpalin1\">Pollster Steve Mitchell tells my colleague Paul Harris</a> today: \"In a way Obama's decisions created Palin. He only has himself to blame.\"</p> <p>On the same lines, <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20080905_Jill_Porter__Obama_should_have_picked_Hillary.html\">Jill Porter of the Philadelphia Daily News has argued</a>: \"McCain picked Palin in a cynical ploy to lure disaffected Clinton supporters, and there wouldn't have been any if Clinton were running for vice-president.\"</p> <p>But I don't buy it. The whole situation reminds me of those who in hindsight argued that Al Gore should have used Bill Clinton more in his 2000 campaign. At the time it didn't seem like that. Although Clinton was popular and using him would have meant Gore could run on his economic record, his affair and subsequent impeachment were often invoked in George Bush's pledge to \"restore honour and dignity to the White House\". Hillary's primary campaign this year has shown what a mixed blessing the former president can be, highlighting problems with his ego and temperament.</p> <p>Palin's nomination has obviously changed the dynamic of the race, and not in Obama's favour. After months when he held a consistent poll lead, the latest average shows McCain ahead by 2.3 points. <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/09/10/politics/politico/main4433771.shtml\">CBS News even predicts</a> that \"Sarah Palin's presence - coupled with [Hillary] Clinton's absence - may be altering one of the great verities of American politics: that women voters overwhelmingly favour Democrats.\"</p> <p>That is probably a stretch too far \u2013 especially considering <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGft5zNurFY\">Palin's rightwing positions on key issues such as abortion</a>. The <a href=\"http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/sally_quinn/2008/08/sarah_polin.html\">Washington Post's Sally Quinn</a> has called the notion that women would vote for Palin just because of her gender \"insulting to women, to the Republican party, and to the country\". But even if it were true, that wouldn't remove any of the downsides Obama would have faced in picking Clinton.</p> <p>She would have been a challenge to his authority. The media would have been constantly on the lookout for stories of splits between the two camps \u2013 as they were, to distracting effect, at the Democratic convention. In addition, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/06/hillaryclinton.barackobama&quot;\">Michael Tomasky pointed out</a> in an in-depth analysis of the \"dream ticket\" idea: \"Why would [Obama] choose as his vice-presidential nominee a polarising and controversial running mate?\" He also pointed out that Clinton, who represents New York in the Senate, would not have brought Obama \"a single state he can't get without her\".</p> <p>On top of that, a ticket made up of a black man and a white woman may have proved too radical and inflammatory for middle America. And Joe Biden \u2013 far from forming \"<a href=\"http://washingtontimes.com/news/2008/sep/14/a-debate-obama-cannot-win/\">the snooze team</a>\" \u2013 is a good candidate, helping fill in Obama's relatively modest experience and appealing to working-class voters without undermining his central message of \"change\".</p> <p>But the principal disadvantage in my opinion can be summed up by the image of Bill Clinton roaming around the White House, at a loose end, coming in to the Oval Office to put his hand on Obama's shoulder and tell him: \"Listen, son, here's how we did it in my day, all right?\"</p> <p>There would be two presidents in that White House, and it might get a little crowded. Let me know what you think.</p>",
  "<p>One commonly repeated argument for doing something about climate change sounds compelling, but turns out to be almost fraudulent. It is based on comparing the cost of action with the cost of inaction, and almost every major politician in the world uses it. </p> <p>The president of the European commission, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, for example, used this argument when he presented the European Union's proposal to tackle climate change earlier this year. The EU promised to cut its carbon emissions by 20% by 2020, at a cost that the commission's own estimates put at about 0.5% of GDP, or roughly \u20ac60bn per year. This is obviously a hefty price tag \u2013 at least a 50% increase in the total cost of the EU \u2013 and it will likely be much higher (the commission has previously estimated the cost to be double its current estimate). </p> <p>But Barroso's punchline was that \"the cost is low compared to the high price of inaction\". In fact, he forecasted that the price of doing nothing \"could even approach 20% of GDP\". (Never mind that this cost estimate is probably wildly overestimated \u2013 most models show about 3% damages.) </p> <p>So there you have it. Of course, politicians should be willing to spend 0.5% of GDP to avoid a 20% cost of GDP. This sounds eminently sensible \u2013 until you realise that Barroso is comparing two entirely different issues. </p> <p>The 0.5%-of-GDP expense will reduce emissions ever so slightly (if everyone in the EU actually fulfills their requirements for the rest of the century, global emissions will fall by about 4%). This would reduce the temperature increase expected by the end of the century by just five-hundredths of a degree Celsius. Thus, the EU's immensely ambitious programme will not stop or even significantly impact global warming. </p> <p>In other words, if Barroso fears costs of 20% of GDP in the year 2100, the 0.5% payment every year of this century will do virtually nothing to change that cost. We would still have to pay by the end of the century, only now we would also have made ourselves poorer in the 90 years preceding it. </p> <p>The sleight of hand works because we assume that the action will cancel all the effects of inaction, whereas of course, nothing like that is true. This becomes much clearer if we substitute much smaller action than Barroso envisions. </p> <p>For example, say that the EU decides to put up a diamond-studded wind turbine at the Berlaymont headquarters, which will save one tonne of CO2 each year. The cost will be $1bn, but the EU says that this is incredibly cheap when compared to the cost of inaction on climate change, which will run into the trillions. It should be obvious that the $1bn windmill doesn't negate the trillions of dollars of damage from climate change that we still have to pay by the end of the century. </p> <p>The EU's argument is similar to advising a man with a gangrenous leg that paying $50,000 for an aspirin is a good deal because the cost compares favorably to the cost of inaction, which is losing the leg. Of course, the aspirin doesn't prevent that outcome. The inaction argument is really terribly negligent, because it causes us to recommend aspirin and lose sight of smarter actions that might actually save the leg. </p> <p>Likewise, it is negligent to focus on inefficiently cutting CO2 now because of costs in the distant future that in reality will not be avoided. It stops us from focusing on long-term strategies like investment in energy research and development that would actually solve climate change, and at a much lower cost. </p> <p>If Barroso were alone, perhaps we could let his statement go, but the same argument is used again and again by influential politicians. Germany's Angela Merkel says it \"makes economic sense\" to cut CO2, because the \"the economic consequences of inaction will be dramatic for us all.\" Australia's Kevin Rudd agrees that \"the cost of inaction will be far greater than the cost of action.\" United Nations secretary general Ban Ki-Moon has gone on record with the exact same words. In the United States, both John McCain and Barack Obama use the cost of inaction as a pivotal reason to support carbon cuts. </p> <p>California senator Diane Feinstein argues that we should curb carbon emissions because the Sierra snowpack, which accounts for much of California's drinking water, will be reduced by 40% by 2050 due to global warming. What she fails to tell us is that even a substantial reduction in emissions \u2013 at a high cost \u2013 will have an immeasurable effect on snowmelt by 2050. Instead, we should perhaps invest in water storage facilities. </p> <p>Likewise, when politicians fret that we will lose a significant proportion of polar bears by 2050, they use it as an argument for cutting carbon, but forget to tell us that doing so will have no measurable effect on polar bear populations. Instead, we should perhaps stop shooting the 300 polar bears we hunt each year. </p> <p>The inaction argument makes us spend vast resources on policies that will do virtually nothing to deal with climate change, thereby diverting those resources from policies that could actually make an impact. </p> <p>We would never accept medical practitioners advising ultra-expensive and ineffective aspirins for gangrene because the cost of aspirin outweighs the cost of losing the leg. Why, then, should we tolerate such fallacious arguments when debating the costliest public policy decision in the history of mankind? </p> <p>Copyright: <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org \">Project Syndicate</a>, 2008.</p>",
